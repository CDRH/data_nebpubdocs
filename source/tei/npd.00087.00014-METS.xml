         <seg id="p003">Nebraska Tractor Tests With the dose of the testing season for 1937 came the end of the eighteenth year of tractor testing at the University of Nebraska. The num - bers of complete tests conducted and reported for these years are as follows*. 1920 mi 1922 19231924 1925 1926 1927 1928 1929 1930 1931.1932 1933 1931 1935 193S 1937 Tout 65 15 5 12 10 8 12 15 7 16 10 14 12 9 11 17 2! '19 285 This bulletin summarizes!the results of 93 of these tests and includes data on all tractors reported by their manufacturers as on the market January 1,1938.- If a tractor has been tested but is not listed in this bulletin, the reader may safely assume that its manufacture/has been discontinued. All tractors tested are certified by their manufacturers as being stock - model machines, conforming to specifications filed with the application for test. No special or high-test fuels are used except in those cases where the manufacturer states in the application for test that they are necessary to insure satisfactory performance of the engine. All results shown on page 1 of the three-page reports are those actually attained in tests and are -with - out correction or. allowances for friction, temperature, altitude, etc. Skilled operators employed by the University are in charge of the tractors when all test results are obtained. ... . In the tests conducted from 1920 to and including the 1927 season, it was permissible to make carburetor settings for each individual load. Beginning with 1928 the "one carburetor setting" was adopted and all results shown on reports of tests made from'l92B to 1934, inclusive, were obtained with the carburetor adjustment remaining unchanged throughout all parts of the complete test. As explained on page 1(3, it was the practice from 1926 to 1936, inclusive, to determine the highest drawbar and belt rating per - missible under the rating code of the American Society of Agricultural. Engineers and the Society of 'Automotive Engineers. The code as revised in 1936 made no provisions for determining horsepower ratings. We use the same method oudined in the former code, however, in arriving at the calculated rating shown on the third page of the three-page test report and in column three of the bulletin summary sheet. In determining the drawbar and belt ratings, runs arc made at a 100 per cent maximum car - buretor setting. The results of | these runs did not appear in the test reports from 1928 to 1934 except in those cases where the "operating setting" was 100 per cent. (See summary sheet column 22 and page 6 of this bulletin.) Test reports issued in 1935, 1936, and 1937 carried the 100 per cent in addition to the operating maximum test figures. The summary sheet issued with this bulletin (No. 313) has been enlarged to include the results of test B and test F (100 per cent maximum belt and drawbar figures) on all current models of tractors tested since March 1, 1930. - A three-page report of each test is issued soon after the test is com - pleted, and this bulletin is compiled from these reports. Copies of the original three-page reports are available at 5 cents per report (on one trac - tor) from the Department of (Agricultural Engineering, College of Agri - culture, Lincoln, Nebraska. By remitting $1.00 those desiring future re- </seg>
         <seg id="p004">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 313 ports without delay will receive for one year without further requests or other cost one copy of all reports or bulletins issued, referring to tractor tests; each one will be mailed as soon as possible after its release. GENERAL PROCEDURE AND RULES IN TESTING TRACTORS When a manufacturer wishes to test a new tractor, application forms are obtained from the Agricultural Engineering Department of the Uni - versity of Nebraska. These forms call for detailed specifications of the tractor to be tested. They are filled out and returned, together with a re - quest for the assignment of a testing date and check for $500.00 to cover the test fee. Dates for test are tentatively assigned in the order in which the application for test, specifications, and testing fee are received. The actual test date depends on the arrival of the tractor and suitable weather con - ditions. Tractors that are shipped by way of die C. R. I. &amp; P. in Nebraska will be switched to the Agricultural College loading dock with minimum delay. It is assumed that the application for test is made by the tractor com - pany with the knowledge that it is not an experimental but an official per - formance test to be run under the tractor specifications submitted with the application and under the testing rules in force. One of the rules is that there shall be no revision of specifications after the test starts nor any change of parts or equipment except to make replacement for that which may be defective or broken. Experimentation desired by the manufacturer must be deferred until after the official test is completed and is then con - tingent on available time. All such experimental work is charged to the manufacturer on an hourly basis. Any data and results thus obtained are for the information of the manufacturer and will not be included in the official report. A representative of the manufacturer should be present during the test. His duties include unloading the tractor, installing wheel equipment or other accessories, operating the tractor during the "limber-up" run, making such adjustments as he may deem necessary before the test, making repairs when necessary during the test, and at the conclusion of the test disposing of the tractor. In addition to these duties, the manufacturer's representa - tive makes all decisions involving permissible choices or company policy relative to the current test which are not covered in the application for test. Before any tests are made the lubricating oil is drained from the crank - case and is replaced with new oil. This new oil is selected by the manu - facturer's representative from the brands generally available in Nebraska. It is of the viscosity specified in the application for test and is purchased by the Tractor Testing Station in sealed containers. The oil is weighed and die weight per gallon at 60° F. is determined. All figures in the test report showing consumption of either oil, fuel, or water in gallons are based on the amounts used in pounds and the weight per gallon at 60° F. The fuel used is the lowest grade recommended by the manufacturer for use in the tractor being tested. For instance, if the application for test </seg>
         <seg id="p005">Nebraska Tractor Tests states that the tractor will operate on gasoline, kerosene, and distillate, distillate will be used. The gasoline used is of the lowest commercial grade available and in no case 1 is a premium fuel used in an official test except in those cases where it is specified by the manufacturer as being essential to the successful operation of the engine., Fuels and lubricants are supplied by the University and charged to the manufacturer at current prices. Test A.—The first test run is one made on the drawbar and is known as the "limber-up" run. The principal object of this test is to take out the stiffness likely to be found in a new machine and give an opportunity to check the condition of the tractor and ascertain if all the parts are working normally. The tractor is operated at approximately one-third rated load for four hours, two-thirds rated load for four hours, and full rated load for four, hours. A reasonable amount of additional time is granted if de - sired. Each one of the forward gears is used for some portion of this test. The manufacturers' representative is responsible for the operation of the tractor during this test and may make such adjustments as he may feel . are necessary, provided they do not conflict with the specifications in the application for test. ¦".;.;¦ Adjustments that are permissible include setting the valve tappet clear - ance and the gap of breaker points or spark plug points, adjusting the clutch, and making other adjustments of a similar nature. This shall not be interpreted to permit the installation of new parts or accessories without having the same mentioned in the official report of the test. .. --'-: ' --¦ ' ./¦ '- . BELT TESTS ' ' . The tractor testing engineer then takes charge of the tractor and it is belted to the cradle-mounted Sprague electric dynamometer used in de - termining the belt horsepower. Before any belt horsepower tests are run, the top radiator tank is drilled to take an indicating thermometer, a fuel line is installed from tractor fuel system to the fuel-weighing equip - ment, and measurements are taken of the belt thickness and of the cir - cumference of both the engine and dynamometer pulleys. No allowances are made for belt losses. . . ¦'¦ -I- '..'.¦¦"¦¦ Test B, 100% Maximum Belt Test.—The engine is then run at full load until it is thoroughly warmed and has reached a condition of constant operating temperatures. All adjustments are made to secure maximum output from the engine at rated r.p.m. Rated crankshaft speed is that number of revolutions per minute recommended by the manufacturer for normal operation. The governor is set to hold the throttle valve to the extreme open position, the spark is set to give the best results, the mani - fold heat control; if present, is set at the most favorable position, and the carburetor is carefully adjusted to that point at which an additional amount of fuel gives no increase but less fuel decreases the power output at the fated speed of the engine. Aitter uniform operating conditions are reached, this test, known as the 100 per cent or rating maximum, is continued for </seg>
         <seg id="p006">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 313 two hours. The object of this test is to check or establish belt horsepower ratings. At ten-minute intervals readings are taken or observations made of engine belt pulley and brake speed, load on scale beam of dynamometer, temperature of water in top tank of radiator, air temperature at a point approximately five feet in front of the center of the radiator, and amount in pounds of fuel used. Barometer readings are taken every hour. The water level in the radiator is measured at the beginning and at the end of the two-hour period, and the necessary amount of water is added to raise it to the same level as at the start of the two-hour test. Water, if used in the fuel mixture, is checked in the same manner. Results of this test are used in arriving at the "calculated" rating appearing on the third page of the three-page reports and in column 3 of the bulletin summary sheet. The manner in which this rating Is deter - mined is explained on page 10. ...... The observed maximum horsepower as determined in this initial belt test did not appear in the published report of each test nor on the summary sheet of the annual tractor test bulletin from 1928 to and including 1954 except in those cases where the manufacturer elected to use the 100 per cent or maximum power setting throughout the complete test. Test B has appeared on all of the individual test reports in 1935, 1936, and 1937. The summary sheet of this bulletin (&gt;«o. 313) has been revised to include Test B figures on all current models of tractors tested since March 1, 1930. On either the first or third page of the report and in column 22 of the summary sheet are figures indicating whether the carburetor setting used was 100 per cent or some lesser value. Test C, Operating Maximum Belt Test—ln case the manufacturer wishes to use a carburetor adjustment leaner than the 100 per cent setting, a series of trial runs of 20 to 30 minutes at leaner settings are made and the manufacturer's representative is permitted to choose from these an "operating setting." This operating setting of the carburetor is used throughout the remainder of the test with the exception of the 100 per cent maximum drawbar test in rated gear (to determine the drawbar rating) when the adjustment used is the 100 per cent maximum power setting as obtained on the belt. The first run on this operating setting is a one-hour maximum power test known as the "operating maximum belt test." The object of this test is to determine the maximum power developed and the fuel consumption at a carburetor setting that is practical for field operations. The radiator cover, manifold heat control, and spark are set at the most favorable posi - tions, the engine is run until operating conditions have become stabilized, and then readings are taken at ten-minute intervals over a one-hour period. Test D, Rated Load Belt Test—The next belt test is of one-hour dura - tion and is known as the rated-load belt test. The object of this test is to determine whether the tractor will carry its rated load on the belt and to secure a record of fuel consumption and other operating data. The tractor </seg>
         <seg id="p007">Nebraska Tractor Tests ¦ ¦•" . ¦. [;•¦¦.• '.:..¦¦ is given, as nearly as possible, its rated load. The carburetor remains set at the operating setting. The governor is adjusted to maintain rated engine speed at rated load. Rated load is determined in one of two ways. If the tractor is rated by the manufacturer, sufficient load is applied to develop rated horsepower at rated engine speed. In case the manufacturer either does not specify the rating of j the tractor or elects to accept the "calculated" rating, then rated load becomes 85 per cent of the corrected maximum as calculated from the results of [the 100 per cent maximum belt test. Test E, Varying Load Belt Test.—The last run on the belt is known as the varying-load test. The carburetor setting and ignition timing are the same as in the rated-load test. The object of this test is to show the governor control of the speeel and also fuel consumption when the load varies. It is comprised of six twenty-minute runs made in the following order: The first is rated load,) which is the same load as the one-hour rated load test just completed; in fact, if conditions are favorable, the rated and varying load tests are continuous and the last twenty minutes of the rated - load run are used for the first twenty of the varying-load test. This is fol - lowed by twenty minutes at no load. The minimum load is applied and the power developed ordinarily is something less than one horsepower. The next load applied is one-half of the rated-load torque and this is fol - lowed by a maximum horsepower test in which enough load is applied on the dynamometer to pull the engine far enough under rated speed to insure an extreme throttle opening. The last two runs are made at one-fourth and three-fourths rated-load torque, respectively. During the varying-load test the amount of heat applied to the intake manifold may be changed according to the load if an easily controlled manual adjustment, such as a lever operating from the drivers' seat, is pro - vided. An effort is made to] maintain the recommended temperature of the cooling medium when possible, by regulating the amount of covering on the radiator in those cases where an adjustable cover is provided. These adjustments, we feel, require; no more attention than may reasonably be expected from a careful operator. End of Belt; Test.—When possible, the friction horsepower and the compression pressure at rated engine speed are checked at the end of the varying-load test. These figures do not appear in the report of the test but are useful iii checking the mechanical condition of the engine before starting the drawbar test. 1... '¦'• DRAWBAR TESTS Test F.—The first drawbar tests made are maximum horsepower runs at two carburetor settings, operating and 100 per cent. The 100 per cent maximum test is made in one gear only, that designated by the manu - facturer as most-suitable for plowing or ordinary farm work. It is com - monly known as "plow gear," "working gear" or "rated gear." The re - sults of a test in: this gear, with the carburetor adjusted at 100 per cent as found on the belt, are used to determine the "calculated" drawbar rating. </seg>
         <seg id="p008">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 31j The observed 100 per cent maximum drawbar horsepower is corrected to standard conditions, multiplied by 0.75, and the result is the "calculated" rating. This is explained in detail on page 10. The results of this rating maximum test have not appeared in the published report of each test nor in the summary sheet of the annual tractor test bulletin from 1928 to and including 1934 except in those cases where the manufacturer elected to use the 100 per cent or maximum power setting throughout the complete test. The summary sheet of this bulletin (No. 313) has been revised to in - clude Test F figures on all current models of tractors tested since March 1, 1930. The manufacturer's representative is permitted to select the tire, wheel, lug, and extension-rim equipment from that supplied on stock tractors or that regularly orlered to the trade in Nebraska but at extra cost. The same tire or wheel and lug equipment must be used on all the drawbar tests. When drawbar tests are made on rubber tires, additional weight may be placed on the rear wheels or rear of the tractor. The total weight on the rear wheels is not to be in excess of the tire manufacturer's recom - mendations. In the case of the crawler tractors, a choice may be made in the type and width of track and the type and size of cleats, subject to the same restrictions as obtain for wheel tractors. The drawbar specifications as to dimensions and adjustments for height and point o£ attachment must be the same for all of the drawbar tests. They must also conform to the specifications in the application for test. Test G, Operating Maximum Drawbar Test.—Operating maximum drawbar tests are made in the forward gears, using the operating car - buretor setting selected and used on the operating belt tests. The object of these tests is to determine the maximum horsepower the tractor will develop in each forward gear with the carburetor adjusted at the operating, setting with engine running at rated speed under the prevailing tempera - ture and barometric conditions. After the tractor is thoroughly warmed and brought to a condition of constant operating temperature, at least two suitable drawbar runs are secured over a measured distance of 500 feet' on the testing track. A suitable run is one in which the operating tem - peratures are normal, the throttle is open to the extreme position, the load is relatively constant, and the average engine speed is at or very close to that specified by the manufacturer. Very seldom is a pull used in which the variation from rated speed is more than one per cent and in each test in each gear an attempt is made to obtain an average number of revolu - tions per minute, which does not deviate from rated speed more than one-half of one per cent. Occasionally there is not sufficient traction with steel wheels to hold the engine speed down to the rated figure at wide - open throttle without producing slippage of approximately 20 per cent or more. In such cases the throttle is closed to that point where the slippage is a reasonable amount or something less than 20 per cent. The method used in making maximum drawbar tests on rubber tires is explained in detail on page 19. </seg>
         <seg id="p009">Nebraska Tractor Tests Test H, Rated Load Drawbar Test—The last run made on the draw - bar is the ratedi-load test. The duration of the test is ten hours' actual run - ning time (as nearly continuous as^possible) with constant load. A record is made of the itime and reason for each stop, and also of any adjustment or repairs made on the tractor. The object of this test is to determine whether the tractor can pull its rated load continuously and to secure a record of fuel consumption |on drawbar work. The governor is adjusted to give rated speed of the engine with the tractor pulling rated load and in the gear recommended for | plowing or ordinary farm work. The car - buretor remains at the operating setting. Rated load is determined in one of two ways. If the tractor is rated by the manufacturer, sufficient load is applied to develop rated horsepower at rated engine speed in rated gear. In case the manufacturer either does not specify the rating of the tractor or elects to accept the "calculated" rating, men rated load becomes 75 per cent of the. corrected maximum as calculated from the results of the 100 per cent maximum drawbar test in rated gear. Once each hour during the rated-load drawbar test a chart is taken, by means of the graphic recording drawbar dynamometer, of the drawbar pull; observations are made of the time required to travel 500 feet, the revolutions of the drive wheels over this same measured course, and the temperature of the air and cooling medium. From the chart and observa - tions, calculations are made for the drawbar pull in pounds, the rate of travel in feet per minute and miles per hour, the drawbar horsepower, the engine revolutions per minute, and the drive-wheel slippage in per - centage. The testing operator maintains the load as nearly constant as possible and by following the progress of the test applies such a load as will be sufficient to develop horsepower equal to or slightly in excess of rated horsepower. ¦ ,r END OF TESTS At the conclusion of the rated-load drawbar test the lubricating oil is drained from the crankcase and weighed, the specific gravity, at 60' is determined, and the number, of gallons drained is calculated. A record is kept throughout the test of all oil added or drained. The test report shows the total number of gallons of new oil put in the crankcase and the gallons of used oil drained. , At this time the tractor jis inspected. The manufacturer's representa - tive, when so directed by the engineer in charge, disassembles any part of the tractor or its accessories in order to facilitate inspection. Particular attention is centered on such specifications as.clearance volume, valve and port dimensions, bore and stroke, transmission, differential and belt-pulley reduction ratios, and the condition of such parts as valve heads and seats, spark plugs, magneto or distributor breaker points and fuel, oil, and water connections.. ; - During the drawbar tests, or on their completion, the tractor is driven to a government-inspected farm scale on the Agricultural College campus and weighed. The weight which appears in the test report is the observed </seg>
         <seg id="p010">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 313 weight plus the weight of the operator and the amount of fuel necessary to completely fill the fuel tank. When all of the tests have been completed and the inspection made, the engineer in charge may release the tractor to the manufacturer's repre - sentative or at his discretion may withhold the release until the test report is issued. INTERPRETATION OF SUMMARY SHEET Name, Col. I.—The tractor name as it appears in the body of the sum - mary report is the name by which it was known when the machine was tested. If it has been changed, the same has been noted below. Horsepower Rating by Manufacturer, Col. 2.—This is a figure deter - mined by the manufacturer as being a reasonable output for the engine. The figure appearing first is the drawbar rating and the second is the belt rating. Horsepower Rating, Calculated, Col. 3.—For several years the A.S.A.E. and S.A.E. codes were quite generally accepted as the standard for tractor rating. These two groups, the American Society of Agricultural Engineers and Society of Automotive Engineers, revised their Tractor Test Code in 1936 and it no longer makes any provision for determining either belt or drawbar horsepower ratings. We have, however, in the Nebraska Tractor Tests continued to use the same method of determining belt and drawbar ratings as was formerly embodied in the A.S.A.H. and S.A.E. codes. These ratings are somewhat less than the maximum horsepower output of the tractor in order that the operator may be sure of having a certain amount of reserve for emergencies. The belt horsepower rating is 85 per cent of the maximum corrected horse - power obtained by correcting the observed horsepower in Test B to stand - ard conditions (60 ' F. and 29.92" Hg). The drawbar horsepower rating is 75 per cent of the maximum cor - rected horsepower obtained by correcting the observed horsepower in Test F to standard conditions (60° F. and 29.92" Hg). The correction formula used is as follows: BHPc — BHPo X (Ps ¦+- Po) X VTo-4- Ts where BHPc = corrected brake horsepower BHPo = observed brake horsepower Po ¦= observed barometric pressure in inches of mercury Ps = standard barometric pressure in inches of mercury To = observed absolute temperature in degrees Fahrenheit Ts = standard absolute temperature in degrees Fahrenheit The following is a typical application of the correction formula: Let us use Test 284 as an example. Looking at Test B on page 1 of the three - page report, we find that the BHPo = 26.75 horsepower Po = 28.880" of mercury Ps = 29.920" of mercury </seg>

The corrected brake horsepower is sometimes known as "sea level" horsepower, or the amount di horsepower developed under "standard con - ditions." . ¦.'. . ¦ j .':¦ ¦'. ¦¦ '¦". '.¦ ... ':' The "calculated" belt rating is obtained by multiplying the corrected horsepower by 0.85. In this case the rating would be 28.11 X 0.85=23.89. Test F, 284, shows a maximum observed drawbar horsepower of 19.83, air temperature of 88° F. and barometer reading of 28.775". The correc - tion factor is 1.067 and that multiplied by 19.83=21.16 maximum cor - rected drawbar horsepower. The "calculated" drawbar rating is 21.16 X 0.75, which equals 15.87 horsepower. Weight as Tested, Co], 4J—This is the weight of the tractor and full fuel tank, full radiator, operator, and such attachments as are necessary in the testing procedure. The total weight of these attachments varies from 30 to 40 pounds. j Rated R. P. M., Col. 7.—ln this column appears the speed recommend - ed by the manufacturer as the rated engine speed. In some instances a range of speeds may be recommended but for the purposes of this test it is necessary that some one rated speed be selected by the manufacturer. The manufacturer's specifications as to drawbar pull, rate of ground travel, pulley speed, and belt horsepower are all based on the rated engine speed. Fuel Used, Col. 9.—The manufacturer specifies the grade of fuel that may be used in a tractor. In the event that machines are sold to burn several grades of fuel, the lowest grade is used. High-test or special fuels arc used only when specified By the manufacturer as being necessary to the successful operation of the engine. Oil, Cols. 10, ill, 12.—The|viscosity of the lubricating oil used conforms to the manufacturer's specifications and the brand is one selected by the manufacturer's representative from those available in Nebraska. The gal - lons of oil placed in and drained from the motor are calculated figures obtained from observations of weight and the specific gravity of the new and used oil. .-¦ ' , I </seg>
         <seg id="p012">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 313 Belt Horsepower, Cols. 14, 23, 31.—1n these columns are figures indicat - ing the horsepower delivered at the end of the belt under the conditions existing at the time of the test. See pages 14 to 17 for detailed explanation of horsepower. Average Engine Revolutions per Minute, Cols. 15, 24, 32, 74.—An at - tempt is made to maintain such loads and such governor adjustments on rated runs as will result in a deviation of not more than one per cent from rated speed. Fuel Economy Figures, Cok 16, 17, 18, 25, 26, 27, 33, 34, 35, 76, 77, 78.—The amount of fuel used is expressed in three ways. The first term is gallons per hour. Comparisons with other tractors as to relative economy are not readily made with this expression of fuel consumption because the amount of power developed is not included in the term. Two other expressions of fuel economy, horsepower hours per gallon and pounds per horsepower hour, both allow direct comparison to be made between two machines. A horsepower hour is the term applied to the arithmetical result of horsepower multiplied by time in hours. Ten horse - power hours might come from the development of ten horsepower for one hour, from one horsepower for ten hours, from two and one-half horse - power for four hours, or from any other combinatin of horsepower and hours svhich. when multiplied together would equal ten. Then, if by the burning of a gallon of fuel one engine is able to develop eight horsepower hours and another burning the same amount of the same fuel will develop eleven horsepower hours, obviously the second engine has the better fuel economy. In other words, the larger the number of horsepower hours per gallon, the better the fuel economy. The third term, pounds per horsepower hour, expresses the amount o£ fuel used to develop one horsepower for one hour. The smaller this value, the better is the fuel economy. Pounds per horsepower hour may be readily converted into horsepower hours per gallon by dividing the weight of a gallon of the fuel used by the consumption in pounds per horsepower hour; or. conversely, dividing pounds pet gallon by horsepower hours per gallon gives pounds per horsepower hour. Some like to compare tractors on the cost per horsepower hour basis. For instance, two tests might have been made on the same identical trac - tor, one on gasoline and the other on distillate. Let us assume these very reasonable figures: That on the operating maximum belt run, the distillate test shows 10.00 and the one on gasoline 9.00 horsepower hours per gallon. Then if distillate costs 10 cents per gallon and gasoline 14 cents per gallon, the cost per horsepower hour for distillate would be 10 cents divided by 10 horsepower hours per gallon, or 1 cent per horsepower hour; and for gasoline, 14 cents divided by 9 horsepower hours per gallon or 1.56 cents per horsepower hour. This fuel saving made possible by the use of low - grade fuel would be offset to some degree by the cost of the additional lubricating oil requited when making the more frequent oil changes or - dinarily considered necessary when using the lower-grade fuels. Another </seg>
         <seg id="p013">Nebraska Tractor Tests controversial point is whether or not the use of distillate materially shortens the life of a tractor as compared with the service that can be obtained when using gasoline. We do not j have a conclusive answer as to how much greater the maintenance costi would be, if any, when burning distillate in an engine designed for it than when using gasoline. Diluted lubricating oil, if clean, apparently does; not produce the rapid wear once attributed to it. ¦•'¦. ¦¦¦' ¦.... - ¦¦•"¦••" To burn low-grade fuel successfully, proper cooling medium and in - take manifold temperatures must be maintained. This may be readily done when operating at a steady load, but for intermittent operation, gasoline is unquestionably more satisfactory than distillate. The most favorable operation can be obtained from any fuel when: used in an engine that is particularly designed for it.

The. cooling medium is maintained as nearly as possible at the temperature recommended by the manufacturer. Only such accessories as are standard equipment are used to maintain this regulation. j Carburetor Adjustment for Percentage of Maximum, CoL 22.—A tractor is not ordinarily required to develop its maximum horsepower. There is a point in the range of the carburetor adjustment where the tractor will develop nearly its maximum horsepower and still use considerably less fuel than it does at the point of maximum output. This point is determined by running a series of belt tests at various carburetor settings. The manu - facturer's representative then | selects some carburetor adjustment as the operating setting. It is determined by dividing the horsepower obtained at this point—the point of operating setting—by the horsepower at the 100 per cent setting and multiplying the result by 100. This percentage figure appears in column 22. i ...

         <seg id="p014">Nebraska Ac;rk:iltiral Experiment Station Bulletin 313 Miles per Hour, Cols. 44, 48, 52, 56, 60, 64, 68, 73.-These speeds are calculated trom observations of the time required to travel, while pulling the described load, a distance of 500 feet. Slip of Drivers, per cent, Cols. 45, 49, 53, 57, 61, 65, 69, 75.—These arc average slippage figures. The manner in which they are obtained is dis - cussed under "Drawbar Testing Equipment." HORSEPOWER Horsepower is a rate of doing work, and work is a force acting through a distance. For instance, a force of 150 pounds acting through a distance of 10 feet would do 1,500 foot pounds of work. However, unless we know the length of the time in which the work is done, we do not know how much power is developed. If, in one case, the work is done in two minutes and in another only one minute is required, then the amount of power developed is twice as great in the second instance as in the first. To develop one horsepower it would be necessary to do 33,000 foot pounds of work in one minute or 550 foot pounds in one second. Drawbar Horsepower.—Suppose we wish to determine the drawbar horsepower required to pull a three-bottom plow three miles per hour. First, we shall have to assume that the draft per bottom is some value, let us say 600 pounds. This, of course, will vary with the type and condition of soil, the depth and rate of plowing, and the condition and adjustment of the plow. If each bottom has a draft of 600 pounds, then the total pull required is 1,800 pounds. One mile per hour equals 88 feet per minute and three miles per hour equals 264 feet per minute. Then 1,800 pounds acting through a distance of 264 feet in one minute equals 475,000 foot pounds of work done per minute, and 475,000 divided by 33,000 equals 14.40 horsepower. If it were desired to pull the same number of pounds half as fast as before, then only 7.20 horsepower would be needed. If the rate of travel were twice as fast, or six miles per hour, then 28.80 horse - power would be required to pull the 1,800-pound load. The work done at the drawbar or on the belt is known as useful work. Non-useful work is done in moving the tractor, in flexing the belt about the pulleys, in slippage both of the drive wheels and of the belt, and in overcoming friction in gears and bearings. Improved gear and bearing design and materials, as well as reduction of tractor weight, have brought the useful drawbar horsepower of the modern tractor much closer to the belt horsepower than was true in the early models. Work also is done in overcoming the internal friction of the engine caused by piston-cylinder contact, connecting rod and main bearing friction, and the resistance of other moving parts. The use of rubber tires reduces the rolling resistance of a tractor, or in other words, less power is required to move the tractor over the ground than when steel wheels and lugs are used. This leaves more engine power available for useful work at the drawbar and accounts for the superior fuel economy of rubber over steel, particularly in the higher gears. </seg>
         <seg id="p015">Nebraska Tractor Tests Belt Horsepower.—The ipoint o£ maximum available horsepower of an engine is at the flywheel. Few current tractors are designed, however, so that the belt pulley may be attached directly to the flywheel. The belt horsepower must pass through one set of gears and sometimes more before it is delivered to the belt. The belt horsepower figures shown in our re - ports are obtained after the power has been transmitted through die belt and the driven pulley and]they represent the amount of power available for useful belt work. i In an analysis of belt horsepower, there are the same factors—force, distance, and; time—as in' drawbar horsepower. Force is represented by the number of pounds of effective tension in the belt and the other two, distance and time, are the number of feet of belt travel per minute. The rate of belt travel will be controlled by the size and speed of the tractor belt pulley. For each revolution of the pulley the belt will be advanced a distance equal to the circumference of the pulley. Then, the revolutions per minutej of the tractor belt pulley multiplied by the pulley circumference will equal the belt travel in feet per minute. This is assuming there will be no belt slippage. Actually the slippage will vary from 1 per cent to 5 per cent and with any given load will depend on the tightness of the belt asjwell as the size and condition of both pulleys and belt. With few exceptions the belt slippage on the official tests is held to 1 per cent or less. j: '¦;'¦¦. While manufacturers have used a fairly uniform belt travel throughout their own line of equipment, belt speeds as found on the various makes range from 2,450 to 3,400 feet per minute. This often proves troublesome and confusing to the operator, who may have a tractor made by one manufacturer and belt-driven machines purchased from one or more other concerns. : "'¦•¦- '•'*'! For instance, of two popular general-purpose-type tractors of the 2-3 plow size on the market, tractor A has a belt speed of 2,450 feet per minute and tractor B 3,300 feet per minute. Here is an example of what may and quite often does happen. Tractor A is used to operate an ensilage cutter which is designed to run at 650 r.p.m; If we divide the belt travel, 2,450, by 650, the result is the circumference of the cutter pulley, or 3.77 feet. The circumference of]a circle equals the diameter times 3.1416 or expressed in a: formula: S /.'¦;* : ."-. I c=jtp ; :': - ' where C = circumference • ,¦'; I ¦ . ¦¦&gt;•—3.1416 , ,/'¦¦. I D = diameter . ¦ Then it is also true that' . ¦ .-;¦ "' [-.- ; -¦.. ¦ D = C/jr ; . ;.V , ;' •¦¦¦ Then 3.77 feet, the cutter pulley circumference, divided by 3.1416 equals 1.20 feet, or, multiplied by 12, approximately 14% inches. Either a 14- or a 15-inch pulley might be used on the cutter, although the smaller size would be preferable since it would run a little faster and compensate for belt slippage. . : </seg>
         <seg id="p016">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 313 Suppose now that, for one reason or another, the operator wishes to use tractor B on the cutter and he does not change the cutter pulley to the proper size. If he selected a 14-inch cutter pulley for tractor A, then the circumference in feet is 14 X 3.1416 divided by 12, which equals 3.67 feet. But tractor B's belt speed is 3300 feet per minute and 3,300 divided by 3.67 equals 899 revolutions per minute or an overspeed of approxi - mately 250 revolutions. The power needed to operate the fan represents quite an appreciable part of the total power requirements of an ensilage cutter. An overspeed of 35 to 40 per cent would probably not affect the cutting mechanism a great deal, but the fan would consume from two to two and one-half times as much power as at the rated speed. This means that tractor B would be able to operate the cutter at only a fraction of its normal capacity, since the excessive power requirements of the higher fan speed would leave less power available to cut the ensilage. If the fan blast at 650 r.p.m. is sufficient to blow the ensilage into the silo, then power is wasted if the fan is run at a higher rate. An alternative would be to reduce the tractor engine speed to about 70 or 75 per cent of its rated value. The cutter would then run at the proper speed but the engine power at this reduced speed would be so much less that the cutter could not be operated at normal capacity. The logical thing to do would be to install on the cutter a 19- or 20-inch pulley, because 3,300 -*¦ 650 = 5.08 feet and 5.08 X 12 ¦+¦ 3.1416 = 19.40 inches Proper pulley sizes are very important on many machines, in addition to ensilage cullers. Some of those more sensitive to speed changes are the threshers, hullers, hammer grinders, and irrigation pumps. For instance, on one popular 6-inch horizontal centrifugal pump opera - ting against a 40-foot head, a speed change of 55 revolutions per minute, from 940 to 995, would produce 900 gallons per minute instead of 400, the horsepower required would rise from 7.5 to 12, and the pump efficiency from 54 to 76 per cent. By increasing the speed from 995 to 1065, the pump would deliver 1200 gallons per minute at a power requirement of 16.9 and the pump efficiency would drop to 72 per cent. The total speed change of 125 revolutions, 940 to 1065, would increase the pump discharge from 400 gallons per minute to 1200, and the power required would vary from 7.5 horsepower at the low speed to 16.9 at the higher figure. Variations in the amount of head against which the water must be pumped influence the power requirements. Other performance figures on this same 6-inch pump show that 1.45 horsepower will deliver 400 gallon per minute against a 10-foot head at a pump speed of 510 revolutions per minute and an efficiency of 70 per cent, while to pump the same amount of water against a head of 100 feet would require 24.7 horsepower, a pump speed of 1485, and the efficiency would be 41 per cent. If when pumping </seg>
         <seg id="p017">Nebraska Tractor Tests ¦•'¦.' ' . '.'' &#132; . • '•¦' ¦¦¦'...¦¦ '.. ¦¦¦'¦¦ against a 100-foot head the pump speed is increased only 40 revolutions per minute (1485 to 1525); the quantity of water discharged would go from 400 to 1200 gallons per minute, the power required from 24.7 to 39.0 horsepower, and the pump j efficiency from 41 to 78 per cent. A 3-inch pump of this same type would deliver 400 gallons per minute against 100 - -foot head at a power requirement of 145 and an efficiency of 70 per cent. These figures are not meant to confuse but rather to impress the pump irrigator with the fact, that there is some one "best combination" of pump size, pump speed, and power plant for each installation. The amount of draw-down or lowering of the water level produced by'continuous pump - ing at the desired rate, the total head against which the pump will operate, and a number of other details should be known before the pumping equip - ment is purchased. The Agricultural Engineering Department will be glad to receive inquiries relative to the selection of proper sizes and types of pumping equipment, the! development of irrigation wells, and the pre - paration of land to be irrigated. Many tractor users who do not. have a speed counter would find it very useful in checking the tractor pulley speed or the speed of the driven machine. While counters are available at a nominal figure, some operators prefer to use this simple method of checking pulley speed. A distinguish - ing mark, such as a streak of white paint, is made on the outer surface of the belt. Then the pulley in question is rotated by hand and the revolu - tions counted until the full length the belt has passed over the pulley. The mark on the belt moving at the relatively slow rate makes it possible to count the belt revolutions in one minute, as indicated on the second hand of a watch. The belt revolutions in one minute multiplied by the number of turns of the pulley per belt revolution gives a quick check on pulley speed. . '; . &#132;; ... . A similar plan may be used to check engine speeds on drawbar work. The number of turns on the engine necessary to produce one revolution of the drive wheel is determined for each gear. This maybe readily done by removing the spark plugs, carefully noting the relative position of some point on a drive wheel and some stationary part of the tractor chassis, placing the tractor in the desired gear, and counting the number of turns of the starting crank necessary to advance the tractor drive wheel one complete revolution. The drive wheel revolutions per minute may be easily counted in the field by'tying a rag to a spoke. This figure (drive wheel r.p.m.) multiplied by jthe crankshaft-to-drive-wheel ratio previously determined will give the engine speed. ¦¦ DRAWBAR TESTING EQUIPMENT Comments.—All of the drawbar pull exerted by the tractor being tested is transmitted, by suitable (equalizers and a hydraulic piston-cylinder mechanism called a draft unit, to the drawbar load. The pressure in the draft unit is carried through' flexible metal tubing to the draft-recording instrument, The essential mechanism of this draft-recording unit is a gas- </seg>
         <seg id="p018">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 313 engine pressure indicator which has been so adapted to the requirements that it leaves on a special chart a continuous record o£ the drawbar pull of, the tractor. From this chart, showing the pull in pounds, and from stop - watch readings showing the time of travel over a measured course, the horsepower developed is calculated. Rotary switches having ten contact points are attached to each drive wheel and connected to magnetic counters which record to one-tenth of one revolution the number of revolutions made over a measured distance. From these same readings are calculated the engine speed and the drive wheel or track slippage. In determining the slippage the tractor is driven without any drawbar load for a distance sufficient to give at least 10 revolutions of the drive wheels or crawler tracks. This distance is then accurately measured and is used as a basis for computing wheel slippage. The computations are as follows: The distance covered at no load is divided by the number of drive - wheel revolutions to obtain the number of feet advanced per revolution. The number of revolutions made in advancing 500 feet is recorded by the electric counters. This number multiplied by the feet of advance per revo - lution at no load gives the distance the tractor would have traveled had there been no loss due to slippage. However, the tractor actually advances only 500 feet. The difference between these two distances is divided by the former, and the answer multiplied by 100 is the percentage of slippage. (When speaking of rubber tire tests, some prefer to use the term, "travel reduction".) Drawbar Loading Machines.—ln determining the drawbar horsepower of a tractor, it is necessary to provide a source of load which may be readily varied. One loading machine, which has been used in a large number of test since 1931, is built about a McCormick-Deering 15-30 tractor. A gear - type pump is mounted on the platform and driven by a roller chain from a special sprocket which replaces the brake pulley. The discharge line of the pump is carried up and forward to valves mounted on the top o£ the radia - tor. These valves may be closed or opened to increase or decrease the amount of power absorbed by the pump. A return line from the lower radiator connection to the inlet opening of the pump completes the system. Additional load may be obtained by placing the tractor in gear and opera - ting the engine against compression without fuel or ignition. If a light load is desired, the tractor may be placed in gear, the fuel and ignition turned on, and the throttle set to give such assistance as will result in the desired load. The design of this equipment is not original except as improvements have been made from time to time. The International Harvester Com - pany had built two similar machines and at the time the Tractor Testing Station needed a new machine were able to furnish the plans and part of the special equipment necessary to make the conversion. Another loading machine built about a pneumatic-tired 15-30 Mc- Cormick-Deering tractor was first used in the 1936 testing season. The rear wheel equipment was changed to dual zero-pressure tires for the </seg>
         <seg id="p019">Nebraska Tractor Tests 1937 season. A four-speed transmission mounted in the power line from the tractor rear wheels to the gear-type pump permits the use of this machine at travel speeds up to approximately 25 miles per hour. Still another machine, a smaller one, has a range of load from about 200 pounds to 1,600 pounds and a possible top speed of 40 miles per hour. The essen - tial parts of this machine are the rear axle assembly and transmission from a heavy-type passenger car, a gear-type pump, a radiator and fan, a supply tank, and suitable controls, j ; . . . A close coupled four-wheeled vehicle, called the instrument car, is used to carry the recording instruments and an observer. A small gear pump mounted on this chassis, and driven by the rear wheels through a reversed transmission, provides drawbar load for the very small tractors. RUBBER TIRETESTS. Starting with the 1934 season,'supplementary tests on rubber tires, at no extra charge, were offered to manufacturers making drawbar tests on steel wheels and lugs. The first manufacturer to take advantage of this offer was Allis-Chalmers in test 223 on their model "WC" tractor. The routine drawbar tests were made on steel wheels and lugs. Then a four-hour fuel-economy run was made in third gear, after which the steel wheels were removed'and rubber-tired wheels were mounted. For all steel and rubber tests, the added weight per rear wheel has been such that the total weight on each rear tire did not exceed the tire manufac - turer's recommendations. ! ¦':¦.'¦¦.¦¦ ' : : '¦" . . ."•'.¦¦ The tests made on rubber tires have consisted of operating maximum drawbar horsepower tests for each oi the forward gears and fuel-economy runs of four hours each in second and third gears. In the lower gears the traction developed by rubber tires and wheel weights, as ordinarily used, is not sufficient to transmit maximum engine horsepower. To determine the maximum horsepower in each gear, a series o£ runs were made, starting with the throttle partly closed so that the governor controlled the engine speed and with sufficient \oad appVied to produce a drive-wheel slippage o£ 5 to 6 per cent.. Other runs were made with increased load, but with the throttle opened wider to give rated engine speed which, of course, gave increased slippage. This balancing of throttle opening, engine speed, load^ and slippage was carried to the point where either the engine was developing maximum power or the slippage was so great that the horsepower was appreciably reduced, usually a slippage of 25 to 30 per cent. The horsepower was calculated for each of the 500-foot tests, and such runs as produced the largest amount of power (and at the same time keeping within one per cent of rated; engine speed) were selected as representative of the operating maximum drawbar horsepower in that gear. j / . . The following arbitrary method was used in arriving at a suitable horse - power to develop in the fuel tests. The relationship between the rated and operating maximum horsepower on steel wheels in rated gear was deter- </seg>
         <seg id="p020">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 313 mined. In test 223 this was 12.M divided by 14.36x100 = 84.5 per cent. This was varied from test to test, being as low as 76.4 per cent (test 249) and as high as 90.9 per cent (test 282), with a 10-test average of 81.8 per cent. Carrying along the illustration in test 223, the amount of power that was desirable to develop in the second-gear fuel-economy run on rubber tires was obtained by multiplying the operating maximum horsepower in second gear on rubber, 14.19, by 845 per cent, which equals 11.99. An examination of the test results shows that 12.08 horsepower was the aver - age developed over the four-hour period. In the same manner, the desired horsepower figures for third gear on rubber (17.59X0.845=14.86) and for third gear on steel (13.34X0.845=11.27) were calculated for the fuel - economy tests. This method just outlined applies to tests 223, 237, 238, 249, 250, 282 291, 292, 293, and 294. Tests 274 and 275 were conducted on rubber tires only, as the tractors had not been designed to operate on steel wheels and lugs and none were available. The drawbar tests made on these two rubber - tired tractors were the same as normally would be made on the steel-wheel equipment. THE LAW Purpose of the Law.—The Nebraska Tractor Law, known as House Roll 85, 37th Session (Art. 10, paragraphs 5531-5543 inclusive, pages 1751 and 1752, Compiled Statutes of State of Nebraska, 1922), which became effective July 15, 1919, was enacted to encourage the manufacture and sale of improved types of tractors and to contribute to a more successful use of the tractor for farming. It was thought that the best method of accomplishing these objects would be to require a tractor of each model sold in the State to be tested at the State University and to have the results of these tests made public. Provisions of the Law.—Stated briefly, the provisions of the law are- That a stock tractor of each model sold in the State shall be tested and passed upon by a board of three engineers under State University management. That each company, dealer or individual offering a tractor for sale in Nebraska shall have a permit issued by the State Railway Commission. The permit for any model of tractor will be issued after a stock tractor of that model has been tested at the University and the performance of the tractor compared with the claims made for it by the manufacturer. That a service station with full supply of replacement parts for each model of tractor shall be maintained within the confines of the State and within reasonable shipping distance of customers. Nebraska Tractor Law.—Full text of the law as found in 75-901 to 911 inclusive, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1929, and revised by House Roll 526, 49th Session (1933) is as follows: </seg>
