Your Excellency: In compliance with the law governing this department, which pro - vides that a report of all business transacted, orders issued, and acts performed by the State Fire Marshal, his deputies and others constitut - ing the department be made to you annually, I take pleasure in sub - mitting to you, this the Twenty-second Annual Report, covering the activities of this department from the period beginning January 1, 1930, and ending December 31, 1930, both dates included. The department has been operated in a businesslike manner and well within the funds at its disposal, and whatever measure of success has been obtained has been due to the courteous, loyal and united efforts of everyone connected with the department, the volunteer fire department organizations, and the public. This department was under the conscientious and able management of State Fire Marshal, John C. Trouton, from January 8, 1925, until November 1, 1930, at which time he was taken from us by the grim reaper. Death. Since November Ist, the undersigned has carried on, as provided by law, the Fire Marshal's duties, as well as. my own, to the best of my ability. Deputies Ed. E. Hayduk, Thomas L. Wilson, Ray E. Eaton and M. H. Mockenhaupt, and our secretary. Miss Sigrid Rasmussen, have worked earnestly and consistently in an effort to reduce fire hazards, and I am pleased to report that their efforts in this direction have been rewarded in a very gratifying manner. Respectfully submitted, L J. BUTCHER, First Assistant State Fire Marshal. Lincoln, Nebraska, January 1, 1931. ' i - .-■" r ' ,-'■.'■ </seg>
            <seg id="p004">FIRE PREVENTION WEEK PROCLAMATION Conservation of life and property is one of the main purposes of organized society. A recent Safety Week- in Nebraska served to focus public attention on the ever-growing accident menace to life and prop - erty on our public highways. Much of the danger to human life and loss of property, whether from accidents on the streets and highways, or from accidents and fires elsewhere, comes from the carelessness and neglect of the people themselves. While a policy of indemnity for any purpose may protect the property involved, it cannot bring back life or compensate for the suffering and permanent disabilities entailed. Furthermore, it cannot restore the loss which comes to the aggregate wealth of the people through the destruction of property. These elementary principles should induce both the government and the individual to stress the necessity of vigilance. The annual loss in the United States by fires amounts to fifteen thousand lives, many thousands injured, and a property loss of half a billion dollars. These catastrophies and losses constitute a challenge to both the government and the people. While increased attention to fire prevention in recent years has resulted in conservation of both life and property, many avoidable tragedies and unnecessary losses still occur. WHEREFORE, Believing that the fire prevention is the patriotic as well as economic duty of every citizen of Nebraska, I hereby pro - claim October 5 to 11, 1930, as Fire Prevention Week and urge every citizen to make a special effort to reduce fire hazards not only during that week but throughout the year. I commend the public press, edu - cators, civic leaders and civic organizations, for the educational work being done, and respectfully ask continued activities for the solution of one of our major problems. In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this 29th day of September, 1930. ARTHUR J. WEAVER, . Governor. </seg>

Some officials are on record as making a positive statement that more than 30 per! cent of the fire loss is incendiary. This is undoubtedly an extravagant statement, but it is conservatively estimated that 10 per cent oif fires show evidence of incendiarism. It occurs to me that by co-operating together and thor - oughly investigating every fire of suspicious origin we may materially decrease the fire. waste in this state and make the crime of arson so unprofitable and so unpopular that \ it will be seldom attempted. Arson has always been considered one of the most serious crimes and has been classed with murder and treason, and in some states, even now, a conviction of arson carries with it the death penalty. In - cendiary fires can, for ordinary purposes, be separated into five classes, according to motive: 1. To conceal evidence of some other criir.e. 2. Malice or revenge. . &gt; 3. Malicious mischief. . ■ . ■ i ■ 4. Pyromania or some other form of insanity. 5. Desire to defraud the insurer. ' ••■ I ■■-■■■ Every fire is presumed to be of accidental origin, and as the fire - men are the first to reach the scene of the fire, it is usually within the province of these men to overcome the presumption of accident and to discover evidence to show that the fire was incendiary. One of the first and most important steps in an arson trial is to prove what the lawyers call the "Corpus Delecti," or the body of the crime. In other words, before evidence of a motive; or even a! confession, can be intro - duced in a criminal trial it must first be proven that the specific crime charged has been committed. In a case of arson the specific charge is the burning of a building or other property. </seg>

If the candle, is to be pidked up, lift it by the wick and turn it over to the Fire Mar - shal's office, for examination for fingerprints] The same care should be exercised in handling any other articles which- were plainly used by the incendiary, for their examination for fingerprints. All cases of suspicious fires should be immediately referred to the State Fire Marshal for further investigation, but the members of the fire department should bear in mind that, being the first at the scene of the fire, it is their duty, if the ! fire is incendiary, to collect and de- ' velop the evidence to support this fact Of course, it is impossible to properly investigate the cause of a fire during its progress, but where the circumstances are suspicious, as soon as the fire is extinguished a watchman should be placed in charge of the building until such time as proper investigation can be made. (Signed) L. J. BUTCHER, Assistant State Fire Marshal. i ' ~~\ : ■ STANDARD EQUIPMENT OF FIRE DEPARTMENTS The hose couplings of all fire departments in this state should be brought to a standard. The standard for hose couplings established by the National Board of Fire Underwriters is known as seven and one - half threads to the inch. National Standard. It is essential that this standard should be adopted by all cities, towns and villages, so that in case of a big fire occurring, and a call for help being sent out, other fire companies responding to the call can couple on the fire hydrants wherever and whenever necessary. I ' ' 1 At the Baltimore fire, Washington and Philadelphia sent their equipment to assist, but their equipment was useless for they could not connect onto the fire hydrants. The fire loss was forty million dollars. This might have been greatly reduced had all equipment been standard.

These Suggestions Will Help You to Solve This Problem PUMPING ENGINE PRESSURES It is evident that a short method which will enable an operator of a pumping engine to determine the pressure suitable under various ordinary conditions would be quite welcome,, and with that in mind the following has been prepared as a guide. It should always be borne in mind that a few pounds variance either way makes but little difference in the amount of water that reaches the fire. There is an old saying that any stream that does not make a black spot where it hits is of little, if any, value. A good stream is one that will enter through a window with force, and at this point not lose con - tinuity of the stream by dividing into a shower or spray, and should appear to shoot 90% of the whole body of water inside a 15-inch circle, and 75C« of it through a 10-inch circle. It is generaly considered that an effective nozzle pressure is ap - proximately as shown in the following table which also shows the dis - charge in gallons per minute at such pressure: Size of Pressure Nozzle at Nozzle Discharge %-inch 50 lbs ...120 G. P. 11. "s-inch 50 lbs 160 G. P. M. 1 -inch 50 lbs 209 G. P. M. 1 %-inch ...50 lbs : 265 G. P. M. l»4-inch 50 lbs 326 G. P. M. 1%-inch 60 lbs 434 G. P. M. l^i-inch 60 lbs 515 G. P.

For ex - ample, a %-inch or a 7g-inch tip is best suited for small fires; 1-inch and 1 %-inch tips are effective on fires of ordinary magnitude; 1M, - inch tips should be used on single lines directed upon large fires; larger sizes are used in connection with large stream appliances, such as deluge sets, deck pipes, monitors, turret pipes, and ladder nozzles. </seg>

Have the same determination that the French had when they were defending Paris from the Germans, before our boys had arrived. Their slogan was "They shall not pass," and they didn't. Our slogan should be, in this great fight against the iire demon, "They shall not start to burn." Convert your friends and neighbors into, fire preventionists organ - ize a fire prevention club, get the assistance of the Boy Scouts and the Camp Fire Girls, and enlist the aid of your superintendent and teachers of the public schools, to see that the children get the required instruction of thirty minutes each i month on fire prevention and that they have fire drills at least once a month. I If your school buildings are not of fire resisting construction, insist on having proper fire escapes, where such escapes have not already been provided. Also get together and send in petitions to your state senator and representatives of your district, asking them to vote for better laws to assist in enforc - ing fire prevention and safety rules and regulations in this state. We should have a state law requiring electricians to install all wiring in accordance with the National Underwriters" Electrical Code. There should be a strong law on the handling of gasoline and kero - sene and the installing of oil burners;' also on the cleaning and dyeing uusiness. A law should be passed with a penalty to enforce the teach - ing of fire prevention in the schools and having the proper number of nre drills. Unless we get these laws passed with teeth in them, there are men and women so careless they will pay no attention to our requests. ' ' " I '■'■' I ' The State Fire Marshal's Department is doing everything it can with the limited means to get rid of Nebraska's fire hazards, but we cannot do it alone. We need your assistance, every one of you, and we are ready at any time to give your our help in any way we can and as long as it is needed. I thank you. L. J. BUTCHER, Assistant State Fire Marshal. </seg>
