            <seg id="p003">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 269 INGLESIDE HOSPITAL FOR THE INSANE, INGLESIDE. NEBRASKA To his Excellency, Honorable Keith Neville, Governor, and to the Honorable Members of the Board of Commis - missionert of State Institutions, Henry Gerdes, Silas A. Holcomb, and Eugene 0. Mat/field. Gentlemen: As per your order and in compliance with the laws of the State of Nebraska, with pleasure the Superintendent submits herewith the sixteenth biennial report of Ingleside Hospital for the Insane, covering the period from Decem - ber 1, 1916, to November 30, 1918. ACKNOWLEDGMENT Divine providence has been kind to us. The wards of the state and those attending them have been abundantly provided for. The hospital has not been visited by epi - demics nor serious accidents. Thanks be to God for His kindness and mercy. The wholesome advice and friendly support so kindly given by the several members of the Board of Commission - ers of state institutions has contributed largely to the suc - cess of the present management. Each individual member of the board has the personal thanks of the superintendent. The people of Hastings and many residents of the state at large have shown by their kind words of commendation that they appreciate the efforts put forth by the hospital authorities and their co-operation has been an inspiration to the superintendent ever to do his best for the welfare and comfort of our fellow beings who have unfortunately been deprived of their reasoning powers. - It is gratifying, indeed, to say that we have been sur - rounded by loyal assistants each of whom has endeavored </seg>
            <seg id="p004">THIRD BIENNIAL REPORT OF to do his part and all have been ever ready to advise with us in solving the many intricate problems incident to hos - pital work. The patients have generally been very well contented and have almost without exception, when mentally able, ap - preciated the efforts made for their care and comfort. Our employee population consists of ladies and gentle - men of high character, all of whom, we believe, are inter - ested in their work and all rendering faithful service. The department heads have been conscientious in their work and every department of the institution is working in harmony with all other departments. MEDICAL STAFF There have been several changes in the personnel of the medical staff during the past two years. On Janu - ary 31, 1917, Dr. Charles A. Oaks was called to his reward after an illness of five days. The cause of his death was pneumonia. Dr. Oaks had served several years on the Ingle - side hospital medical staff. He was a competent physician and a thorough institution man. The Ingleside hospital and the State of Nebraska suffered a great loss in the passing away of Dr. Oaks. Dr. L. T. Sidwell, who for several months had charge of the female receiving service, was advanced to the posi - tion of assistant superintendent of the Nebraska Hospital for the Insane. Dr. Joseph S. Leisure, Dr. Ward W. Hedlund and Dr. Harry J. Pittock have entered the medical service of the United States army and at this writing they are still in the service. Dr. George M. White and Dr. 0. B. Christie, both of whom are experienced hospital physicians, have accepted places on our staff. During the period of the war we have reduced our staff to four physicians. It is to be hoped that some of our physicians who are now in the army service may soon return to the service of the state. </seg>
            <seg id="p005">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 271 Dr. Clara M. Hayden and the superintendent are the only physicians at Ingleside who were here at the beginning of the biennium. BOYS IN SERVICE Twenty-four young men who were employed here re - signed their places and joined the forces of the United States army. Every man has made a creditable soldier and each one will be given his hospital position when he is ready to return. Officers and employees have contributed liberally to the Red Cross and other organized charitable activities. Our people have invested more than $50,000.00 in government securities. Every man and woman connected with the In - gleside service is an outspoken American and every one has done his duty in helping to win the war. IMPROVED CASES About 50 per cent of the young adults admitted to this hospital during the past two years have recovered and re - turned to their homes, again becoming useful citizens in their various communities. Others will yet be restored. SENILE DEMENTIA Among those admitted between the ages of sixty-five and eighty-five, very few recover. It is most unfortunate that these very aged persons are sent to a hospital for the insane, when, if just a little more patience were exercised and a little more time taken to reason out the fact that at best these childish old folks could only have a few more days or weeks to live, the family would be saved the em - barrassment of having a father or mother adjudged insane. Then the mortality rate of this and other similar hospitals would be lower. During the past year a considerable number of very aged people suffering, of course, from acute mental excita - tion have been admitted to this hospital, some only living a few days, others who have better physiques continuing </seg>
            <seg id="p006">THIRD BIENNIAL REPORT OF their residence here. If the public could be made to know that the average person of extreme age suffering with men - tal difficulty should be kept in his own home, placed in the care of a competent nurse, caused to keep his bed for a period of a few days or possibly a few weeks he would be able to get along in his own home just as well and possibly a great deal better than he would in a large hospital away from home environment and home care. ■ TUBERCULOSIS We now have at this hospital only a few active cases of tuberculosis. All tubercular cases are segregated, given special diet and the most airy and commodious quarters. Much attention has been paid to prevention, consequently we expect in the future to have less rather than more tuberculosis. A large number of those who have had active tuberculosis have become better and are now in a stationary, non-active stage of the disease. CRIMINAL INSANE The State of Nebraska is not doing its whole duty in caring for the criminal insane. They are not being cared for properly and certainly not safely. It is unfair to the quiet, docile, well-behaved insane man to be associated with a rough, dangerous insane person who has confirmed criminal tendencies. The state should erect a building either at one of the state hospitals or at the prison, planned and constructed with the primary idea to safely care for the criminal insane of Nebraska. Herewith following is sub - stantially what was said by the superintendent in his annual report made November 30, 1917: "During tho past two years fifteen insane criminals have been transferred from the State Penitentiary to this hospital. During many years past, practically all of the criminal insane of the state have been sent to the Ingleside Hospital for the Insane. A number came from the Penitentiary; others have been tried for crime and, being found in - sane were, instead of being sent to the prison, sent directly to this hospital. A few of the insane criminals have recovered and have been returned to the prison, some of whom it is my understanding have been paroled and are now in a normal mental condition. </seg>
            <seg id="p007">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS "We have a ward at this hospital where forty desperate men are housed. We have no steel bars on the windows, we have no iron cells nor have we any other than wooden doors. "A number of these men have been murderers and are still homi - cidal. Some have been convicted of other desperate crimes, also a number of thene men have escaped from jails and penitentiaries, and how w&lt; them without accident or tragedy, I am unable to compre- hend. This institution is wholly unprepared to care for the criminal ins; The following paragraph appeared also in our last annual report: 'SEPARATE BUILDING FOR CRIMINAL INSANE "In this connection I wish to recommend that a building be con - structed cither at this hospital or at one of the other state hospitals es - pecially for the care of the insane criminal and the homicidal insane men, — such a building being carefully planned with a view to giving proper care to the patients and the safety of the employees in charge." The ordinary insane man should he escape is not likely to do much harm in a community. We have, however, in this hospital a number of men, should they escape, I would greatly fear for the safety of the community where they, in their insane wanderings, might decide to stop. The build - ing as recommended should be large enough to house one hundred or more, thereby relieving the wards of this hospi - tal and the other state hospitals of this particular class of patients. Further it is not just to the average insane per - son to be housed in the same building and under the same surroundings with the criminal insane or the insane person who is violent and greatly disturbed. In the state of Idaho within the past two years one insane criminal sleeping in a small dormitory, as our insane criminals are sleeping (twenty in one room here) killed five of his fellow patients. I can readily see how one insane man violently disturbed, noisy, etc., could keep a prison in a continual uproar. Un - fortunately, this state has not yet prepared a place for the care of the criminal insane. In not having done so the prison authorities are handicapped in doing the best for their charges as are also the state hospital people in caring for the ordinary insane. </seg>
            <seg id="p008">274 THIRD BIENNIAL REPORT OF GENERAL CONDITION The physical plant has been well cared for. One paid painter and occasionally two have been continuously at work on the inside and outside of the hospital, also we have two and sometimes three patients helping the painter. There is much repair work done by the carpenter force. The engineering department is always a busy place. The general repairs have been kept up, some improvements made and others in process of construction. FARM AND GARDEN Both the farm and the garden have produced abun - dantly. Unfortunately much of the alfalfa was killed during last winter but this land was made to produce other valu - able crops. By referring to the farm tables you will find set out in detail the quantity and value of produce grown, the amount consumed, and the amount on hand. DAIRY HERD The state owns at Ingleside one of the best Holstein herds in the state. Fifty to seventy-five good producing cows have helped to furnish nutritious food for the patients. SWINE A large herd of cholera immune hogs contributes liber - ally to the food supply of the hospital. KITCHEN We have completed a general kitchen, dining room and dormitory building. This is to take the place of the old poorly constructed, unsanitary and dangerous building once occupied by the kitchen and dining room. The old build - ing was built about thirty years ago and was constructed of soft brick. Several attempts have been made to repair the building but competent architects advised that the building could never be made safe and sanitary for the purpose in - tended. The new building is modern in every way and is </seg>
            <seg id="p009">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS a credit to the state. The kitchen is one of the most used buildings about the hospital. Meals for more than 1,200 people are prepared three times a day in this kitchen and if there is any building that should be more sanitary than others, it is the kitchen. The old kitchen building has been rebuilt, by removing the third story, taking off wings and projections and rear - ranging the interior. Hereafter this building will be known as an "industrial building." Shoemaker shops, weaving rooms, library and reading rooms are now being installed. LIBRARY The state library commission has furnished a large number of well-selected books. No other department of the hospital contributes more largely to the contentment and happiness of our patients than does the library. We hope the authorities will recognize and ever keep in mind the importance of maintaining and keeping up to date, a well-equipped library for this hospital. DENTISTRY With the present arrangements in vogue relative to the care of patients' teeth we feel that our patients and prob - ably those in the other state hospitals are not receiving the attention that they should have. Patients who are able to go to the city have their dental work fairly well cared for. Extractions are frequently done by members of our staff but to properly care for the dental work of our patients and save their teeth it is the opinion of the superintendent that a state dentist should be employed to spend all of bis time in the various state institutions, dividing the time ac - cording to the patient population of the various institutions. NEEDS With this report you will find recommendations for ap - propriations needed for the mainten a nce of this hospital; also for repairs and improvements needed, all of which are most necessary. The "maintenance appropriation," for the </seg>
            <seg id="p010">276 THIRD BIENNIAL REPORT OF proper care of Ingleside's large patient population; the "re - pair appropriation," for the conservation of the state's hold - ings; and the "improvement appropriation," very necessary to relieve the crowded condition of the wards and to prop - erly equip the hospital with facilities for quickly restoring, to their former places in homes and business, the unfortu - nate men and women who suffer an acute mental break - down. APPROPRIATIONS NEEDED FOR THE BIENNIUM BEGINNING APRIL 1, 1919 MAINTENANCE AND SALARIES The method of arriving at the estimated needs for maintenance and salaries for the coming biennium is as fol - lows: Capacity of the hospital, 1,160 patients; estimated per capita cost of maintenance per annum $240.00; for the two years for each patient $480.00; 1,160 patients at $480.00 each for the biennium amounts to $556,800.00. Approxi - mating the probable receipts for pay patients at $75,000.00 for the biennium, we arrive at the amount needed by sub - tracting the estimated "maintenance receipts" from the ap- MUVE.MJS.Vi' UI 1 fU IfULATlUIN Male Femalp Total I'ationts present December 1, 1916. 746 404 1150 Patients received during biennium.. 266 202 Ifis Total under treatment 1012 606 1618 Male Female Total Patients paroled or discharged during biennium 143 133 •Jfifi Patients died during biennium 121 61 LM Patients present November 30. 1918. 748 412 1160 Total nur.iber cared for 1012 60C 1618 Jeneral Maintenance and Salaries . $480,000.00 mprovements to Buildings and Grounds. . . . . 42,000.00 &lt;ew Hospital Building . . 100.000.00 Total ..$642,000.00 </seg>
            <seg id="p011">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 277 proximate total cost as determined and believe an appro - priation of $480,000.00 for general maintenance will be the sum needed. IMPROVEMENTS AND NEW BUILDING The new building asked for is explained as follows: A modern hospital building is needed. A building to accom - modate at least one hundred patients should be built during the coming biennium. At present our patients, who are physically ill, of necessity are compelled to be kept in in - firmary wards, which wards were not originally arranged for sick persons and are not suitable for such purpose. My idea is that a building should be erected and so arranged as to give comfortable quarters for sick patients. One wing for the male and one for the female patients. There should be in this building isolation rooms for con - tagious diseases. This building should have a dietary kitchen and patient's dining rooms. There should be, also, a small male ward and a small female ward to receive new patients, presumably curable, where they can be housed, cared for and treated separately and apart from the chronic insane and incurable cases. On the second floor of this building should be rooms for nurses and attendants. This building should be a modern fire-proof structure, two stories in height. The need of this building is set forth as per above and other reasons for the heed of it is that the capacity of the hospital has been reached. The institution is crowded. A continued demand is being made and will continue to be made for the admission of more patients. The building re - ferred to above, will meet the needs of the present popula- Repairs to Boiler House and Engine Rooms, making Buildings Fireproof I 15,000.00 Plumbing including Repairs to Old Plumbing and New- Material.

            <seg id="p012">THIRD BIENNIAL REPORT OK tion of the institution and will also furnish room for one hundred more patients who will, without a doubt, demand admission during the next biennium. WORD "INSANE" OFFENSIVE Modem thought is against the word "insane" as ap - plied to men and women who are mentally ill. One hundred years ago the term "lunatic asylums" was popular. Two generations back "asylums for insane" was the accepted term. At present a few people in some states still persist in using the term "hospital for insane," as only a few years ago some one unthoughtedly gave Ne - braska's best state hospital the highly offensive and long - lettered name, "Ingleside Hospital for the Insane, Ingleside, Nebraska." The official name as it now stands does not sound right even as it applies to the hopelessly demented patients and when it is continually brought to the attention of patients with fair and good mentality as it is on all letter - heads, report, etc., it becomes highly offensive to them. Many patients are humiliated and depressed by seeing and hearing the official name of this hospital used. Let us for the sake of doing a kindness to sensitive patients, if for no other reason, ask the legislature to change the official name of this hospital to "Ingleside State Hospital" or some other equally applicable term. MORTALITY Considering the fact that a very great number of the patients are very aged the mortality rate for the biennium is very low, the death rate per annum for all patients treated at this hospital has been during the past two years five and one-half per cent. One suicide occurred during the period. Francis Ldght- Osman came to the hospital early in the year, violently in - sane. After the first month he began to improve until the first part of May he appeared to be normal. Immediately we communicated with his relatives in an adjoining state and had arrangements completed for his return to his </seg>
            <seg id="p013">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 279 people. The day before he was to start, while having the liberty of the grounds unattended, he took his life by throwing himself under a passing freight train. THREATENED SMALLPOX EPIDEMIC Early in the fall of 1917 a new employee who came from another town in the state, within a few days follow - ing his arrival showed symptoms of smallpox. The case being mild it was not diagnosed as smallpox until many patients and nearly all of the employees at the hospital had been exposed to the disease. Immediately a rigid quaran - tine was established, the case isolated and all exposed per - sons vaccinated. Consequently only three persons had the disease. INFLUENZA By vaccination and quarantine we have been able so far to prevent the introduction of epidemic influenza into the hospital. The disease has been prevalent in the state and in the city of Hastings for two months. We will, in - deed, be fortunate if we escape the disease. WORK We believe that every able-bodied man and -woman should be employed at some useful occupation. Congenial employment is an aid to physical health as also it is to mental health. By glancing at table "XX" of this report you will note that more than 70 per cent of our patients are daily em - ployed at something useful. None are asked to work unless he or she is physically and mentally able for the task and no patient is expected to be occupied more than three hours in one half day. AMUSEMENTS Musical entertainments and moving picture shows are much enjoyed by all, and two or three such entertainments are generally arranged for each week. </seg>
            <seg id="p014">280 THIRD BIENNIAL REPORT OF POLITICS AND RELIGION This hospital knows no sectarian religion nor partisan politics. We have patients, employees and officers representing every church denomination, as we doubtless have officers and employees of all political parties. No man is ever asked concerning his politics or his religion nor are either of the subjects discussed in any department of the hospital. The superintendent does not know nor does he care with what church or political party other officers or employees affiliate, but has a right to expect, and does expect and de - mand, honest and efficient service. FINANCES The financial affairs of the Ingleside hospital are in good condition. Considering the high cost of all supplies, incident to the world's war, there may be a small deficiency in the maintenance appropriation. The deficiency would have been much greater but for the fact that there was paid during the biennium, by relatives of patients a much greater sum than was estimated. The sum of $75,230.03 was collected as per above and deposited to the credit of Ingleside Insti - tution Cash Fund in the state treasury and this made avail - able for the payment of current expenses. Therefore, by the use of this amount and by giving careful attention to purchases we hope to avoid a deficiency. Itemized state - ment of every financial transaction is sent once each month to the Board's' office. Every expense item except extreme emergency is paid by voucher. — these vouchers being ap - proved by the Superintendent and the Board, are then pre - sented to the auditor of public accounts who issues a warrant direct to the person who has rendered the serivec or delivered the supplies. OFFICERS Every member of the medical staff has worked dili - gently for the welfare of the patients. Research work is </seg>
            <seg id="p015">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS occupying the attention of our staff and each member is ever alert to keep abreast with modern thought and much is being done for those who are mentally afflicted. The steward is a tireless worker and much credit is due him in overseeing and directing the outdoor industries. The ma - tron and the supervisors are capable officials and all de - partments show the results of their thoughtful care. The superintendent besides attending to his many duties con - nected with the administrative work of the hospital has con - tinually kept himself familiar with the care and medical treatment of the patients. He knows every patient and he is in sympathetic touch with every one of them and every department of the hospital. CONCLUSION In closing this report, it is my desire sincerely to thank the members of our medical staff and all of the local officers for their loyalty and hearty co-operation. To the employees, I wish to express my appreciation for the worthy service they have rendered the state, in helping to care for those who are unable to care for them - selves. We believe that all of our co-workers have kept in mind the fact that the Ingleside hospital is being main - tained solely for the purpose of providing care, comfort, treatment and protection for the unfortunate citizens of Ne - braska who have become mentally ill. To the members of the Board of Commissioners of State Institutions, I owe a debt of gratitude, for their wise counsel and advice, for their personal friendship and for their kindly indulgence in overlooking our many short - comings. Respectfully submitted, W. S. Fast, Superintendent. Inpleside, Nebraska, November 30, 1918. </seg>
