            <seg id="p003">204 KIRST BIENNIAL KEPOKT OK To His Excellency, Honorable John H. Morehead, Governor, and to the Honorable members of the Board of Com - missioners of State Institutions, Silas A. Holcomb, Howard Kennedy and Henry Gerdes. Gentlemen : I have the honor to submit for your consideration this the thirteenth biennial report of the Asylum for the Insane of Nebraska, Ingleside, Nebr., covering a period extending from November 30, 1912, to November 30, 1914. In the beginning I desire to briefly mention the change of management which has taken place during the bien - nium. At the election of 1912 an amendment to the consti - tution was adopted, creating a non-partisan Board of Con - trol of State Institutions. This Board constitutes three members appointed by the Governor and approved by the Senate. Not more than two members may belong to the same political party. The law requires that they shall give their entire time to the management and general sup - ervision of all State Institutions, their duties consisting of buying supplies, making contracts, and overseeing all those matters which may be considered necessary in a well regulated institution. The present Board consists of the three following named gentlemen and were appointed by our present Governor, his excellency, John H. Morehead: Silas A. Holcomb, Chairman ; Henry Gerdes ; and Howard Kennedy. They assumed charge on the first day of July, 1913. It was no small underi. ung, yet in this short time it affords me great pleasure to bear witness to the fact of the tre - mendous amount of work which they have accomplished, especially by unraveling the confusion under which these institutions had been for years struggling and placing them upon a business foundation. Heretofore, huge sums of money had been spent an - nually without any particular visible results. In fact the </seg>
            <seg id="p004">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 205 only practical, though somewhat unpleasant, evidence of the appropriations having been used up was the big deficiency to be taken care of at each session of the Legislature. MOVEMENT OF POPULATION On December 1, 1912, there were being cared for in this institution ten hundred seventy-one (1071) patients, six hundred ninety (690) males and three hundred eighty - one (381) females. During the biennium three hundred ninety-nine (399) patients were admitted, of whom two hundred seventy (270) were males, and one hundred twen - ty-nine (129) females. In addition to this, one hundred seventy -one (171) patients, eighty-seven (87) males and eighty-four (84) females have been returned from parole. During the biennium, eighty-five (85) have been dis - charged as recovered, sixty-nine (69) as improved, twenty - five (25) as unimproved, and four (4) as not insane. One hundred forty-six (146) are on parole at this time, thir - teen ( 13) on the escaped list, and one hundred twenty-seven (127) males and forty-five (45) females have died, leaving seven hundred twenty-two (722) males and four hundred five (405) females or a total of eleven hundred twenty - seven (1127) patients in the institution November 30, 1914. HEALTH OF THE PATIENTS The general health of the patients may be considered very satisfactory. Fortunately we have escaped any ser - ious epidemic, with the exception of some few cases of typhoid fever, all of which made a good recovery. During this period prophylactic treatment was freely given, con - sisting of typhoid vaccine. This seemed to have the de - sired result, as no other cases developed. It is not my intention to lay claim to any particular or original treatment. Suffice it to say our efforts have been confined to carefully and conscientiously apply those methods advocated by those who have had the oppor - tunity of devoting their time and energies to the study and research of this work. The holding of staff meetings more frequently is prov- </seg>
            <seg id="p005">206 FIRST BIENNIAL REPORT OF ing most beneficial. At these meetings all matters of im - portance are discussed, such as the advisability of paroling and sending home such patients who, in our opinion, have improved sufficiently to warrant us in doing so, also select - ing those to whom it might be reasonably safe to grant ground paroles, the transferring of patients from one ward to another, etc. New patients are given examinations both mentally and physically, various tests applied, past history of the case as far as possible obtained, together with family his - tory, all of which enables us to arrive at a satisfactory con - clusion as to the proper diagnosis and classification. As stated in my previous biennial report of 1910 as superintendent of this institution, I am still an advocate of the sterilization of the chronic mentally defective. Ex - perience and further observation have been the means of creating a deeper impression upon my mind that it is the only logical conclusion I can arrive at. No one doubts the assertion that insanity is hereditary and, if the increase of this social evil is to be controlled, it can only be done by accepting and putting into practice those methods advo - cated by men who have given their time to the study of this important question. FOOD, CLOTHING AND SUPPLIES As previously stated, purchases of all food and sup - plies .with the exception of emergencies and perishable articles, are made by the Board of Commissioners of State Institutions on competitive bids and upon the open market. In this matter I desire to state that, while I feel the state funds have been carefully handled, resulting in a great saving, yet it is with considerable amount of satisfaction I am able to testify to the fact that the question of econ - omy has not been permitted to overbalance the importance of providing at all times plenty of good and wholesome food, good and seasonable clothing, in addition to keeping on hand at all times those supplies necessary to the suc - cessful management of an institution of this kind. </seg>
            <seg id="p006">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 207 AMUSEMENTS Numerous and varied amusements have been pro - vided. During the summer, band concerts were given on the lawn Tuesday, Friday and Sunday evenings. Baseball games were played and enjoyed by the patients assisted by the attendants. The winter amusements consist of mov - ing pictures, dancing, and orchestra concerts in the amuse - ment hall. These amusements are undoubtedly a welcome recreation and assist in relieving the monotony of hospital life, in addition to being considered by all authorities as a great factor in the treatment of nervous and mental di - seases. In addition to the above we always provide some special entertainment and amusement on all national holi - days. RELIGION Religious services are conducted every Sunday after - noon, presided over in turn by one of the ministers of the respective denominations of Hastings. In my opinion many receive religious consolation from these services, if one may judge from the devout manner in which they conduct themselves and in many ways manifest deep interest. The music is provided by our orchestra, the singing by the of - ficers and attendants, assisted by all those patients who care to do so. REPAIRS AND IMPROVEMENTS Money is well spent in keeping the buildings in repair and preventing as far as possible deterioration. Our regu - lar force of masons, carpenters, and painters have been constantly employed along this line. As this report pro - gresses it will afford me some considerable amount of satis - faction to call attention to a few of the most important items. I may mention the condition of the wards in most cases was bad, showing defective plastering, dirty walls and all kinds of colors consisting of red, green, blue, chocolate, etc. It was a big undertaking and looked as if the end </seg>
            <seg id="p007">208 FIRST BIENNIAL REPORT OF would never be reached. By perseverance we finally com - pleted the most important part of it, although there is still some minor work to be done. To summarize, over thirty wards have been repaired, painted, and decorated. This includes the day halls, dormi - tories, dining rooms, operating rooms, toilet rooms, etc., also the cottage for those attendants who work nights, farm cottages, administration buildings, employees' sleep - ing apartments, employees' dining room, general kitchens, bake shop, power house, and also the large amusement hall. A new double decked porch has been built across the south side of the north annex. This has been much appre - ciated in addition to addini? greatly to the appearance of the building. The old building which was formerly occu - pied as a laundry has been remodeled and utilized for var - ious purposes, part of which has been made into twenty sleeping apartments for employees. A barber shop has been installed on the ground floor, which is a great im - provement to the old one which was in a basement. An - other part has been used for a lounsre room for those pa - tients who have ground parole. Here they have the privi - lege of smoking, reading the newspapers, playing all kinds of games, including cards, checkers, etc. They have shown great appreciation for this and especially do they take advantage of it in the winter time. The administration building or center by which it is more familiarly known, consisting of offices, parlors, sleeping apartments, dining rooms, and kitchens has been re-plastered when needed, re-painted and re-papered, mak - ing it both clean and sanitary, in addition to improving its appearance. SEPTIC TANK The question of building a septic tank has been a bone of contention for years, but apparently it has been pigeon - holed from time to time. Attention has been called before to the sewer pipe emptying into the creek on the farm belonging to the State, the sewerage thus being conveyed through other people's property by this same winding </seg>
            <seg id="p008"/>
            <seg id="p009">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 209 creek. In my opinion, in which I am assured the Board agrees, there is no question of the necessity of building the tank. Therefore, I recommend an appropriation of $4,000.00 for that purpose. RE-SHINGLING BUILDINGS Attention has been called to the serious condition of the roofs of the center and south annex buildings, owing to the worn out and decayed condition of the shingles which are of wood. These leak in every direction besides being a terrible source of danger in case of fire even though it may be in some other part of the hospital. I have sug - gested re-shingling with asbestos shingles and copper gut - ters. There will be an area of about 400 squares to re - cover. The estimated cost for material and labor is ap - proximately about $10,000.00 and I ask for a special appro - priation accordingly. POWER PLANT All the machinery in the power plant has been thor - oughly cleaned and overhauled. To utilize the exhaust steam which was going to waste through the summer, an exhaust hot water heater has been installed at a cost of approximately $1100. This will mean a saving to the State annually of at least twenty car loads of coal. I may also mention an air compressor pump was purchased and installed at the cost of $1500. This assures us of a much greater supply of water and has proved a great benefit and would be especially more so in case of fire. HEATING AND PLUMBING The heating and plumbing system has been given a great amount of attention throughout the summer with the result that we are in a better position today to properly heat all of the buildings than in any previous history of the institution. NEW BARN Special attention has been given to improve existing sanitary conditions. Unfortunately a part of the herd of </seg>
            <seg id="p010">210 FIRST BIENNIAL REPORT OF dairy cows, after examination and testing on two separate occasions, were found to be affected with tuberculosis. The number so found amounting in all to eighty animals. These were shipped to Omaha and killed under the inspection and supervision of the Board ; our steward, Mr. O'Meara ; and the state veterinarian, Dr. Kigin. To protect the remain - ing healthy cows, feeling reasonably sure the old barn was the cause of infection, it was decided to build a new mod - ern dairy barn. The dimensions of the building are as follows : 34x136', having a capacity of seventy cows with hay loft above for 250 tons of hay. The W. D. James steel stanchions were selected and installed. The King system of ventilation was adopted, thus all foul air is carried off through properly constructed ventilating flues. The floors are of concrete excepting that part upon which the cows stand, this being of pressed cork brick, as concrete is con - sidered too hard and cold for the cows to either stand or lie upon. The walls are steel lathed and plastered. It is also equipped with hot and cold water and electric lights throughout the entire building. A detached sterilizing room has also been provided for the purpose of properly steriliz - ing all utensils used in the handling of milk. With but little exception the entire work has been accomplished by our regular force of workmen under the inspection of our steward, M. O'Meara, and the Board to whom great credit is due for providing a^barn which has been pronounced by competent judges as one of the most modern and sanitary dairy barns in the State. The cost was a little less than $6,000, a very moderate amount taking into consideration the splendid addition to the institution and the State. RE-BUILDING STABLES The rebuilding of the new stables, which is a great improvement over the old, cost approximately in the neigh - borhood of $2500. The labor being done by our regular force of workmen. From the result of causes over which we had no con - trol, we had to rebuild the stables. I may explain by stat - ing that during a storm last summer at midnight the old stables were struck by a bolt of lightning, setting fire to </seg>
            <seg id="p011">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 211 the hay loft. The night watch fortunately soon after dis - covered it. The blowing of the fire whistle was quickly responded to, not only by our regular fire department, but by every officer, attendant, and employee about the insti - tution. No one thought it necessary to put on collars or ties, although it is known that some had on trousers. By this tima the fire had made good headway and it was only by heroic efforts that all the horses and buggies and the greater portion of the harness was rescued. It soon be - came apparent it would be impossible to save the build - ing and, although we continued to subdue it by throwing streams of water upon it, our attention was now directed to the saving of adjacent buildings. The night was stormy, the wind blowing a gale from the northwest, carrying and droppini the burning shingles upon the roofs of the center buildings. It was a time of great anxiety, for if one of these buildings had caught fire, it would have meant practically the doom of the greater part of the institution. In the mean time all the patients had been prepared for a quick retreat if necessary and it was certainly a time of great relief when the walls fell in and further danger seemed to be at an end. I desire to say it affords me no inconsiderable amount of satisfaction and pleasure to fully acknowledge and sin - cerely thank all those who so willingly and so generously assisted on that night, realizing as I do most of them were only partly dressed and drenched to the skin, yet under these adverse circumstances I feel they did nobly. I also wish to acknowledge the good will and sincerely thank those gentlemen belonging to the Hastings Volunteer Fire Department who so kindly came out and offered their as - sistance. FARM AND GARDEN The drouth of 1913 proved to be disastrous inasmuch as we were unable to produce more than one-third of a crop both in the garden and the farm generally. After using the small supply of vegetables, we were then compelled to buy on the open market. Only one crop of alfalfa was cut. About seventy acres of corn was cut and put in the </seg>
            <seg id="p012">212 FIRST BIENNIAL REPORT OF silos before it became injured by the bad weather. The loss of the garden and farm products meant a very heavy expense to the institution, as we were compelled to buy practically everything for feed purposes. In addition to these partial failures, unfortunately a very fine herd of hogs became infected with the cholera with the result that the larger portion of them died. The year 1914 proved to be much more prolific. An abundance of vegetables was raised, enabling us to give a change of diet daily throughout the week. Farm products such as corn, alfalfa, and oats while not abundant crops, were at least very satisfactory and in addition there was a very large amount of rough feed grown. This year we have been more fortunate in hog rais - ing, with the result that we have a very fine, healthy herd. FARM MACHINERY BUILDING The housing of farm machinery, a most important matter, has long been neglected and undoubtedly has been a great loss to the State, as farm machinery standing out in all kinds of weather will quickly deteriorate. To remedy this condition, a building two stories high, 36'x80', was built during the fall of 1913. As the work was done, as in former cases, by our regular force of workmen, it is inexpensive and undoubtedly is a beneficial addition to the farm improvements. A NEW HOSPITAL BUILDING REQUIRED Knowing that retrenchment has been a subject for discussion of late, it is with some reluctance 1 approach this subject and yet I feel it my duty to remind your Hon - orable Board of that with which you are already familiar, viz., the crowded conditions under which we are working. For some time we have felt the capacity of the institution had been reached, yet, by sending home those who have improved and crowding beds a little closer together, we have been enabled to receive those cases which seem to be the most deserving. This condition cannot continue much longer and for this reason I recommend that an appropri - ation of $100,000.00 be made for the erection of a hospital building. In addition to this amount, sufficient funds </seg>
            <seg id="p013">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 213 should be appropriated for the purpose of equipment and here will be an opportunity for giving due consideration to the progress made in medical science and research in the treatment and care of the insane. It is generally admitted there has been as much ad - vancement in medical science as in other branches of the pro - fession, but unfortunately the physician has not been sup - plied with proper equipment to bring into practice those advanced ideas. This may be proved by paying a visit to some of our hospitals. Here you will observe every con - ceivable accommodation and consideration has been given over to the surgeon. Magnificent operating rooms, placed in the best positions, are supplied with every necessity re - quired in his work. After observing these things make in - quiry what provision has been made for the physician whose province it is to heal the sick without the knife. If any con - sideration has been given this matter, invariably you will be shown down in the basement or away off in some cor - ner. Consequently these unfortunates are deprived of the advantage of that which medical research has proven to be the most beneficial. We are reminded at this time that the nations of the world are spending millions of dollars daily for the de - struction of life. The people of these nations are depriving themselves of every comfort they had formerly enjoyed. Hundreds of thousands are homeless and they have been compelled to surrender everything most near and dear to them. The horror of conditions is beyond imagination, yet we do know that thousands upon thousands of mothers and fathers are weeping and watching for the boys that will never return. It is at such a time as this we should thank God for the blessings He has conferred upon this country and our State in giving us peace and plenty and in thankfulness let us show we are not unmindful of His goodness. The opportunity for doing this in a small way will present itself during the session of the coming Legis - lature at which time you will be in a position to reverse conditions I have described above by doing that which will assist in saving life instead of destroying it, when appropriations will be under consideration for the use of </seg>
            <seg id="p014">214 FIRST BIENNIAL REPORT OF this institution, especially for the erection of a new hos - pital. I would remind you, Mr. Legislator, you have, for a short time at least, assumed the responsibility of pro - viding for the proper care of these unfortunates who may now or hereafter require treatment. Remember that broad - mindedness and liberality on this occasion will not deprive you of one day's pleasure or of one single comfort which you may have heretofore enjoyed but, on the other hand, it will confer a great blessing upon those who need your help at this time in addition to being a credit to the State. MAINTENANCE APPROPRIATION This appropriation of $290,000.00 has proved to be ample and sufficient to provide abundantly all the necessary requirements and needs of the institution and unless some - thing unforseen at this time appears between now and the end of the fiscal year, we shall be able to report a small balance to our credit. While on this subject, pardon me if I digress and make a few remarks relative to the occasion upon which the above appropriation together with that for the em - ployees' wages were under consideration. At that time, it was necessary for me to appear before the financial committee during the session of the Legislature of 1912. My predecessor, Dr. W. B. Kern, had recom - mended $315,000.00 for the maintenance appropriation and $110,000.00 for the employees' wages appropriation. After giving due consideration to the maintenance appropria - tion, I made the suggestion that the amount be reduced $25,000.00, leaving $290,000.00, assuring them I could suc - cessfully run the institution with that amount and have no deficiency at the end of the fiscal year. The commit - tee very kindly and quickly, in fact almost instantly, acted favorably upon my suggestion. The employee's wages appropriation was then taken up for consideration. As before stated, $110,000.00 had been recommended. I may say prior to this meeting con - siderable amount of figuring had been done to ascertain whether the amount would be sufficient to pay a reason - able wage. Many things had been considered by those who </seg>
            <seg id="p015">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 215 were in a position to arrive at an intelligent conclusion. It was known at this time many of the attendants, both male and female, were young, inexperienced, and wholly unfit for the work, their proper place being in the school room, but as all funds had been exhausted no other help was available, as experienced attendants would not accept the lower scale of wages. Again, it had been the custom to pay the higher priced help consisting of masons, car - penters, enginers, and plumbers, out of the maintenance appropriation, thus relieving the employees' wages appro - priation of these expensive items. After taking into consideration higher wages would have to be paid together with the aforesaid help added to the employees' wages appropriation, it was conclusively shown, so far as I was concerned, that $110,000.00 would not be sufficient and consequently recommended that they raise the amount to $115,000.00. Evidently they did not take kindly to this proposition or they must have thought my first suggestion was all right and my second all wrong. Be that as it may, they reduced the original amount of $110,000.00 to $106,000.00, thus creating a deficiency which at the time was plainly foreseen. Many times during the biennium I have felt somewhat handicapped and on several occasions have been compelled to lose some of my most desirable attendants for the reason they could obtain better wages in other institutions than I could pay. We have been working with as small a num - ber of attendants and employees as might be considered consistent with safety, as there are sixty more patients to take care of than at the beginning of the term and, antici - pating there will be the usual increase during the ensu - ing term, it would be unreasonable to expect any decrease in the amount of money needed. </seg>
            <seg id="p016">216 FIRST BIENNIAL REPORT OF Before closing this report I desire to express my sin - cere thanks and appreciation to the Governor, his excel - lency, John H. Morehead, to the Honorable Board of Com - missioners of State Institutions, the Steward, Medical Staff, and to all other officers and employees of the institution for their able assistance rendered me at all times, fully realizing it would be impossible to successfully manage an institution of this kind without the constant cooperation of all.
