            <seg id="p003">RAISING THE DAIRY CALF. BY E. G. WOODWARD. WHAT IS THE IMPORTANCE OP RAISING DAIRY CALVES? E'here are in Nebraska more than 600,000 dairy cows. The age i&gt;eriod of usefulness of the dairy cow is not more than t years. This means that to maintain the dairy herds of Ne - ka at their present size between 70,000 and' 80,000 heifer ;s must be raised each year. To mate these cows properly dairy bred bulls will require the rearing of about 8,000 bulls I Aside from the necessity of maintaining the herds at their sent size, the importance of calf raising to the Nebraska dairy - q lies in the fact that this is the surest and most satisfactory 7 of improving his herd. It should be remembered, first, that d improvement can come only thru the replacing of worn-out discarded cows by heifers better than the cows they replace. :h heifers are the result of mating a pure-bred bull with a herd rows from which the undesirable individuals have been culled. is neither practical nor satisfactory for the dairyman to buy »e heifers, because he will usually have to pay more for them d it would cost to raise them, and he has no assurance that fers which he may buy are well bred. WHEN DOES IT PAY TO RAISE A CALF? Irhe dairyman's main object in raising calves should be to rove his herd. He may also raise stock for sale either for ding or for slaughter. Under ordinary conditions it will pay •aise every well-bred heifer calf. Heifer calves of inferior ding and grade bull calves or pure-bred bulls of inferior ding should not be raised with the intention of using them breeding purposes. Unless conditions are such that it will to raise these for meat it is best to kill such calves at birth, a they will not leave any inferior offspring in the country. In order to determine what gains may be produced on dairy calves by the use of skim milk and home grown feeds, three dairy </seg>

The results were as follows: Where skim milk is available, as it is on most of the farms Kto 400 pounds, depending upon the size of the breed and the if t of the calf. Whether or not it will pay to raise steer calves the dairj' breeds or the inferior dairy heifers for meat will &gt;end entirely upon conditions. In some places whole milk is sold and skim milk is not avail able. If a calf is raised ou whole milk by shortening the milk feeding period to about three months, the cost of feed will be about as follows * 'able oi. n/, vtng re8ulti ■im milk ii}, of jecdtng to Hie age three dairy steer &lt;f one y^ar.

THE CALF AT BIRTH. flOvery precaution should be taken to give the cow about to hen the most cleanly and sanitary surroundings possible, cow should be allowed to calve in a clean, freshly bedded 1, or better yet in mild weather, in the pasture. It is essen - that surroundings be clean in order to avoid infection of freshly severed navel cord. The cow will be in better physi condition and will yield more milk if she is dried up ab«&gt;i i weeks before calving time than she would if milked up to the B of calving. RAISING A CALF ON SKIM MILK. It is now fairly well understood that calves properly raised mi skim milk are equally as growthy, thrifty, and vigorous as able 3. — Shovnng the feed required t of six months when a small amoun raise a calf up to the age of whole milk is used.

            <seg id="p006">6 Iie raised upon whole milk or those allowed to run with their is. In fact the skim milk calf will oftentimes show a more led framework than a calf raised on whole milk. It is usual, ever, for the whole milk calf to appear smoother and more np, due to the fact that it lays on a greater amount of body than the calf fed skim milk. I Except for the fat that has been removed, skim milk is identi - in composition with whole milk. When whole milk is taken ■» the calf's body, the fat of the milk is used to produce heat to p the calf warm and also to form body fat. This same func - 1 can be performed very much more cheaply by starchy grains h as corn, Kafir corn, and oats. Ehe protein of milk, which is the constituent most concerned uscular growth and the building up of the vital organs, is lly as abundant in skim milk as in whole milk. TAKING THE CALF FROM THE COW. It matters little whether the calf is taken from the cow im mediately after being dropped or is allowed to stay with iti mother for several days. The essential thing is that the call receive the first milk from its mother. A calf should always re - ceive the milk from its own mother for the first two or three days of its life, because the milk is quite unlike normal milk and stim ulates the calf's digestive tract to action. I The earlier the calf is taken from its mother the easier will « to teach it to drink. When the calf runs with its mother several days it will learn to drink more quickly if it is not red milk for 24 to 36 hours after it has been separated from cow. In most cases the calf will learn to drink quite readily illowed to suck the feeder's fingers while they are held under FEEDING WHOLE MILK. I The stomach of the young calf is small, so that it is not able landle large amounts of milk. Eight to 10 pounds or 4 or ."&gt; irts per day is the proper amount to feed a young calf. For jry small or weak calf, 6 pounds or -i quarts is sufficient. The lilts are probably a little better when the calf is fed three es daily for the first few days. This is not necessary, how - r, and it is usually best not to feed three times daily unless milk can be obtained fresh from the cow for each feed. The k should be divided equally between the feeds so that a calf og fed twice daily would receive 4 or 5 pounds at each feed. </seg>
            <seg id="p007">7 FEEDING SKIM MILK. E. calf of ordinary vigor can be put on a skim milk diet at the if two or three weeks. The change to skim milk should be ual. This change is best made by substituting a pound of milk for a pound of whole milk at each feed until the calf ceiving only skim milk. Fig. 2. — Calves about two weeks old. These are old enough to be fed skim milk. The amount of skim milk fed should l&gt;e the same as that of the whole milk which it replaces. This will usually be 10 or 12 pounds for a calf two to three weeks old. A gradual increase in the milk should be made as the calf grows, until at the age of five months it is receiving 16 to 20 pounds daily, depending upon the size of the calf. FEEDING GRAIN. The calf will begin to eat a little grain by the time it is two or three weeks old. After it is a few days old, grain should Im - kept before it and a little put into its mouth immediately after it has finished drinking its milk to aid it in learning to eat. I The grain should always be fed dry and never mixed with tlic k. In order that grain be properly digested it is necessary t it be chewed before it is swallowed. Probably the l&gt;est time Feed the grain is just after the milk has been fed. The calf's letite is very keen at this time, and it will take to the grain dily. A good grain mixture to use until the calf has learned to eat well is two parts ground corn and one part crushed oats. When the calf has learned to eat, shelled corn alone will give as good results as any grain that can be supplied. Up to the age of three months it is well to give the calf all the grain it will eat. At that time it will be eating two to three </seg>
            <seg id="p008">8 Raisin;/ the Dairy Calf. |K&gt;uu&lt;l8 daily and may very well be limited to this amount until weauing time. Bhe calf will begin to eat hay at about the same time as it grain, and some should be provided for it to nibble. I ''or the young calf, clover or mixed hay is as good as any. It isionally happens that where alfalfa hay of the best quality id immediately after the milk and grain a calf will gorge f to such an extent that impaction of the stomach may follow prove fatal. When very palatable hay is fed, it is well either apply it in limited amounts or to keep it before the calves all le time so that they will not gorge themselves at any one time, ny case it is best to feed the hay during the middle of the day not immediately after the milk and grain has been fed, as i a great bulk all at once proves a severe tax on the digestive eui. FEEDING SILAGE. K Silage may l&gt;e fed with safety to the young calf, and is very :h relished by it. It is well to pick the pieces of ear out of the ge fed a young calf. In using silage avoid overloading the "s digestive system either by offering even only a small amount upplying it in the middle of the day. WATER AND 8ALT. It is a mistake to assume that a calf does not require water because it is receiving skim milk. The calf should have water accessible at all times, as it will drink considerable despite the fact that it is receiving a large quantity of milk. It is also quite necessary that the calf be provided with salt. It requires salt besides its regular feed, the same as does an older animal. Six months is a very jjmnl age at which to wean a calf, tlm FKKI&gt;1N&lt;; HAY. WEAN1NU. </seg>

A calf can be weaned iu three or four days' lime by gradually reducing the amount fed. SCOURS. E coins in calves are by far the most common sources of ble iu calf raising. If a feeder is able to avoid the occurrence lours in his calves, it is very seldom that other ailments will &gt;y. Scours in calves are of two kinds. WHITE SCOURS. White scours, or calf cholera, is an infectious disease. The germ of this disease enters the blood of the calf soon after birth thru the freshly severed navel cord. This disease always attacks very young calves, usually appearing within three days after birth. It is characterized by the whitish, foul-smelling dung which the calf passes and a depressed, hollow-eyed appearance in the calf. It is nearly aways fatal, and as yet no treatment has been found which will give good results. About the only practical thing that can be done is to avoid the occurrence of this disease by keeping the surroundings of the newborn calf in a sanitary condition. The cow should be allowed to calve in a clean, freshly bedded stall ; or in mild weather, in the open pas - ture. If this disease has occurred on the farm previously, it is well to disinfect the navel cord and belly of the freshly born calf with a 3 per cent solution of creolin or 3 per cent carbolic acid and bind the cord up to the belly with a wide strip of muslin to avoid later infection SCOURS FROM INDIGESTION. The common cause of scours is indigestion, or inflammation in the stomach. This may be brought about by a large variety of causes, but in any case the aim of the treatment should be to remove the source of the inflammation. As in most other ail - ments, half of the battle in curing scours is to begin treatment as soon as any trouble is noticed. The calves should be watched closely and treatment administered upon the first indications of scours. Treatment should always begin by cutting down the ration, thus giving the calf a chance to rid itself of the irritating material. The milk should be cut down at least one-half and in severe cases withheld entirely. In most cases after one or two feeding periods have passed, the calf will appear normal, and full feeding can be gradually resumed. In more obstinate cases it may be necessary to administer a </seg>

After a calf has suffered with scours, feeding should always be light for a few days until the calf regains its strength. 14. — This picture shows the effect of scours on the growth of a calf. These are both pure-bred Jersey calves. The calf at the left of the picture is 34 days older than the calf at the right but weighs leas. When about two weeks old It suffered from a very severe attack of scours and has not fully recovered from the effect. SPECIAL POINTS TO OBSERVE Ejnuuon scours give more trouble in calf raising than any ■ one thing. Scours may be caused or at least favored by a ty of conditions. CONDITION OF THE MILK. To avoid scours it is essential that the condition of the milk be controlled. Milk should always be fed sweet if good results are to be obtained. While it is known that healthy, vigorous calves ma}' be raised on sour milk, it is not a good policy to try to feed it, because it is often impossible to obtain properly soured milk. Milk that has been allowed to stand around until it is half rotten is quite different from normal sour milk tho it may have a sour taste, and it is almost sure to cause trouble if fed to calves. Sweet milk is very much more dependable in quality ami should therefore be used exclusively. CLEANLINESS OF PAILS AND UTENSILS. Scours are often caused, no doubt, by a filthy condition of the feeding pail or trough. Unclean milk or milk out of unclean </seg>
            <seg id="p011">Kiitsint/ the Hairy Calf. 11 renels will cause trouble. It is best to give the calf pails the same treatment and attention accorded the regular milk pails. They should be kept sweet smelling. TEMPERATURE OF THE MILK. Milk should always be fed at a temperature near that of blood heat, or between 95° and 100° F. This is the temperature at which the calf would receive the milk if it were sucking the cow. Cold milk taken into a young calf's stomach so chills it that digestive processes are checked for a time and digestive disturb - ances are liable to follow. Calves that have reached the age &lt;&gt;f two and one-half or three months may be fed milk somewhat colder than !»5°, but in any case the temperature should be constant and a calf should not receive warm milk at one feed and cold milk at the next. Bl thermometer' should actually be used in testing the tern ture of the milk — at least often enough so that the tempera - can be estimated fairly accurately. OVERFEEDING. Erobably the most frequent cause of scours is overfeeding, n properly fed the appetite of the calf will be more keen after ig its milk than before. It is impossible to satisfy a calf's tite for milk without overfeeding it. Overfeeding at any Fig. 5. — Calves in stanchions at feeding time. The milk is weighed for </seg>
            <seg id="p012">12 R&lt;u*mij the Dairy Calf. particular feed is best guarded against by actually weighing the milk at each feed or measuring it in a vessel sufficiently small to avoid guesswork. Weighing is to be preferred, as the foam which occurs on separator milk makes accurate measuring difficult. I If several calves are being fed in the same pen it is best to e ties of some sort for them so that each calf may receive only apportioned feed. For this purpose small, rigid stanchions the most convenient. If the calf is kept tied until after the in is eaten, there is less likelihood of it forming the habit of king other calves' ears. I Overloading the calf's stomach in the morning and evening uld be avoided by feeding the roughage thru the middle of the FEEDING FOAM TO CALVE8. On skim milk fresh from the separator there is always more or less foam. Large quantities of this foam fed to a calf will cause it to become bloated and may even cause sickness. The little that the calf will ordinarily receive with its milk will cause no trouble. CALF PENS AND LOTS. I Dirty, muddy, or uncomfortable quarters are favorable to urs. Calves should not be turned out into muddy or wet lots ire they will not have a dry place in which to lie. In fact ing calves up to three or four months of age will thrive fully well in a roomy, clean, and well-lighted stall as on pasture. ■ young calf should be especially protected from quick changes temperature and cold drafts, which are liable to bring on umonia. VIGILANCE ON THE PAKT OF THE FEEDER. One very important rule to follow in calf feeding is to be con - stantly on the lookout for disorders. Prevention of sickness is far better than curing it. The feeder should always observe the keenness of the calf's appetite and the character of the dung. At the slightest hint of any disturbance the amount of milk should be cut down. DEHORNING THE CALF. Eairy cows should be dehorned, because dehorning makes a more docile, easier to handle and feed, and also makes it ini ible for her to injure the udders of other cows with her l'(»ssibly the most satisfactory way to dehorn a calf is to apply I'll I IS ( |C lH t\ tistl OH 11 It' iMlt'lsll ("111 1 it* Itl't '11114 *&lt;1 'it 'lilllllSt ' 1 1 1 V </seg>

The calf should be treated when one or two days old or as soon as the starting horn can be located. To dehorn the calf, clip the hair from the spot where the horn is starting. Then wet the end of a stick of caustic potash and Fig. 6. — This calf was dehorned by means of caustic potash. The poll is perfectly smooth. rub on the budding horn until a sore spot about the size of a dime is produced. The operation can be hastened by breaking the skin before rubbing on the potash. The calf should not be turned out into the rain immediately after caustic potash has been applied, as it may be washed down into the calf's eyes. Caustic potash should be handled by wrapping a piece of pa - per around the stick. It must be kept in a tightly stoppered bottle, or it will absorb water from the air and dissolve. RAISING A CALF WITH WHOLE MILK. Where whole milk is sold and none of the milk is skimmed, the raising of calves is decidedly more expensive than where skim milk is abundant. Ordinarily the calf must be fed milk until it is two and one-half or three months old before it can be expected to live on a grain and hay diet. This will require 750 to 1,000 </seg>

A calf two and one-half to three months old is able to get along without milk if fed liberally of grain. The gains, however, will not be so satisfactory as those of a calf weaned at a later age. For the calf after weaning at this age, alfalfa hay. silage, and 3 or 4 pounds of a grain mixture made up of 2 pounds corn chop, 2 pounds ground oats, and 1 pound oil meal is very gixxl to use for two or three months. However, the practice of we;ui ing a calf so early is not to be recommended. RAISING A CALF WITHOUT MILK. I It has been found possible by careful handling to raise calves hout milk after three or four weeks old. Such calves arc usu ' badly stunted but may recover from the effects to some ex - t if well fed in later life. Tt is not practical to raise calves his way. CARE OP THE DAIRY HEIFER IAltho the first few months of the heifer's life is the most criti - period of her existence, still many heifers are stunted, due ack of attention after being weaned. THE EFFECT OF TIME OF BIRTH ON GROWTH. I It is a rather common practice to have cows calve in the ing, yet this is not usually the best time. It is a fact that a born in the fall will get a better start in life than one born he spring. It makes little difference in the rate of growth of a calf whether it has pasture or has only dry feed in connection with its milk. But after weaning time the calf that has pasture will make by far the cheaper and more rapid growth. A fall calf will also be ready for breeding so that it will drop its own calf in the fall at the age of about two years. K Furthermore, a cow will give best returns when freshening in fall. This is true because it is usually easier to maintain a idy flow of milk thru the winter and early spring than during summer and fall. Also, dairy products demand highest prices ing the winter. FEEDING. En til a calf is weaned it receives a liberal allowance of pro n its milk, but when milk is removed from the ration it is sary to supply protein in some other form, such as legume </seg>

However, if she does become rather plump it will imt injure her dairy qualities. Fig. 7. — Well-grown dairy heifers in good, thrifty condition. If fed sn as to induce a thrifty growth yet not produce fat, dairy heifers will gain on an average close to 1 pound daily from the age of six months up to two years or calving time.

The proper age at which to breed a heifer will depend very largely upon the size and thrift of the animal as well as upon the breed. Jersey or (Juemsey heifers mature more rapidly than Hoi - steins or Ayi-shires and hence are ready for breeding at an earlier ■ft, The approved practice is to breed a Jersey or Guernsey </seg>

R Nothing has been said about the bull calf, but his treatment lid be the same as that of a heifer with the exception that it Rually necessary to separate the bulls and the heifers at about months of age. From this time on it is advisable to feed the Fig. 8.— Pure-bred Jersey bull, nine months old. This bull Is almost mature enough for very light service.

However, his use at this time should be very ited, else his breeding powers may be j&gt;ermanently injured. It lid probably be safe to allow him to serve one cow every three iks up to the age of one year and not more than one cow per »k up to the time he is 1&lt;&gt; months old. </seg>
