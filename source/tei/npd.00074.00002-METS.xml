            <seg id="p022">TWENTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT Bonds totaling $3,921,500. were filed and approved during the year. Fees collected and turned over to the State Treasurer during the same period amounts to $347.64. In addition to the public grain warehouse companies furnishing bonds, a number of cooperative companies obtained licenses to store grain. The law exempts these companies from furnishing bonds when they re - strict their storage operations to members and stockholders. Before a license is issued under such circumstances, the Commission's rules re - quire that a by-law be adopted declaring that it is the intention to operate as a cooperative company. A copy of this by-law, certified to by the officers of the company, is made part of the records of the Commission. Cooperative companies are. required to comply with all other provisions of the grain warehouse law. Monthly, or weekly, reports of grain in storage are filed by all licensed grain warehousemen. These are very carefully checked with the bonds on file, in order that grain in storage is fully protected. Should the value of grain in storage exceed the amount of the bond at any time, an additional bond is required to be filed. During the year 1932, a consistent effort was made to acquaint ele - vatormen and others of the necessity of- obtaining a grain warehouse license. Warnings through the press to those who owned stored grain were given wide circulation, in order that due diligence might be exercised before grain was placed in storage in an unbonded warehouse. Personal contact was obtained during the year with 318 elevators at various points in the state, through inspections made by employees of the Commission. An effort. will be made during the coming session of the legislature to amend the present grain warehouse law in several particulars. </seg>

OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: Pursuant to notice previously given, these complaints came on for hearing September 26 and 27 and November 5, 1929, before Commission - ers C. A. Randall and John H. Miller, at Omaha. The hearings, while held jointly with the Interstate Commerce Commission, were not co - operative in nature. It was deemed advisable to hold them at the same time as a matter of economy and convenience. A decision in these cases was not entered before this time because of the general investiga - tion of all live stock rates in western district known as Docket 17000, "Rate Structure Investigation, Part 9, instituted by the Interstate Com - merce Commission pursuant to the Hoch-Smith Resolution 43, Stat. L. 801, and because the Interstate Commerce Commission had withheld its decision in Dockets 22405, 22458 and 22800, involving the interstate phases of the cases. On August 6, 1931, the Interstate Commerce Commission entered its decision in the three dockets just referred to, whereupon complainants in the Nebraska cases, Formal Complaints 640, 641 and 648, asked for oral argument before the entire Commission, which was granted, but due to the crowded condition of our docket was not heard until September 2, 1932. These proceedings are related and will be disposed of in the one report. By Formal Complaint 640, filed June 4, 1929; Formal Complaint 641, filed June 19, 1929, and Formal Complaint 648, filed October 15, </seg>
            <seg id="p029">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 1929, it is, alleged that the failure of the line haul carriers, defendants herein, to absorb the full amount of the switching charges assessed in addition to the line haul rates for switching intrastate carload ship - ments of live stock between the interchange tracks of such carriers at South Omaha, and the unloading and loading chutes of the Union Stock Yards Company at South Omaha, -results in aggregate charges which are and were unjust, unreasonable, unjustly discriminatory, unduly preju - dicial and unlawful of complainants, the Omaha Live Stock Market, and shippers using that market, all in violation of the laws of the state of Nebraska governing common carriers. Complainants seek just, reason - able and nonprejudicial rates and charges for the future, and reparation on the shipments made during the statutory period and during the pendency of these proceedings. Complainants in Formal Complaint 640 (the same as I. C. C. Docket 22405), Include the Omaha Live Stock Exchange, described as a volun - tary organization of commission men, order buyers and yard dealers at the South Omaha market; also numerous live stock commission firms, members of the organization. Complainant In Formal Complaint 641 (the same as I. C. C. Docket 22458), is the Farmers' Union Live Stock Commission of Omaha, a cooperative marketing agency owned and con - trolled jointly by the Farmers' Educational &amp; Cooperative State Union of Nebraska and five other similar organizations. Complainant in Formal complaint 648 (the same as I. C. C. Docket 22800), is Armour &amp; Com - pany, a corporation operating a packing plant at South Omaha. In - tervening petitions were ' filed by certain other Interested parties noted in the list of appearances. In so far as interveners interests are af - fected by the intrastate adjustment, their complaints will be considered as a part of these proceedings and whatever relief is granted to or - iginal complainants herein will automatically extend to the interveners. The record shows that while separate hearings were held in these cases it was stipulated that the record in Formal' Complaint 640, I. C. C. Docket 22405, would be considered a part of the record In Formal Com - plaint 641, I. C. C. 22458. No hearing was had in Formal Complaint 648, I. C. C. 22800, but the parties to the proceeding agreed that it should be submitted upon the record made in the other cases embraced herein. As a general rule, live stock received at and shipped from South Omaha is handled through the stock yards of the Union Stock Yards Company. The lines of the road haul carriers do not reach the unload - ing pens. Cars coming into South Omaha are placed on a transfer track adjoining the stock yards, from which they are switched by the South Omaha Terminal Railway over' its own tracks to the unloading chutes. This same arrangement applies to other carload freight mov - ing to other industries located on the rails of the South Omaha Terminal Railway. As a matter of fact, so-called "dead freight" such as coal, sand, Ice, meat and lumber, consigned to or -shipped from certain </seg>
            <seg id="p030">TWENTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT other industries on the rails of the Terminal Railway, moves over the same rails serving the unloading chutes and to points more distant. The record shows that the switching charges (usually $4.66 per car — much greater than on live stock), assessed by the Terminal Railway on dead freight to or from such industries beyond the unloading chutes Of the stock yards, are absorbed in their entirety by the road haul lines. A far greater service, is performed on so called "dead freight" where the switching charge is absorbed than is performed for move - ments of live stock. In fact, the . switching of live stock involves only a minimum ot service. The testimony shows that South Omaha is considered the second largest market in the United States which means that a very substantial volume of live stoek is handled in and out of South Omaha every year and, naturally with a large number of packing plants at that point, it means a substantial volume of "dead freight". Of the inbound live stock traffic in 1928 about 55 per cent was intrastate in nature. Complainants as well as defendants submitted a brief history of the switching charges and absorptions at South Omaha. We believe that a review of that history is necessary in order to show conditions surrounding the present adjustment. Prior to 1896, the line haul car - riers serving South Omaha had their own rails into- the. stock yards and no switching charges were assessed on shipments to or from those yards. After that date, the carriers entered into an agreement with the Union Stock Yards Company whereby that company took over the tracks owned by the road haul lines in so far as those tracks were within the stock yards district, and that company has since operated as a common carrier, primarily for the purpose of serving the stock yards, and has established switching charges for the handling of the traffic between the interchange tracks with the road haul lines and the chutes within tbe stock yards. This . change was for the purpose of improving the service. The history of the Union. Stock Yards Com - pany's business and general character of the service was carefully con - sidered in Applications 38 and 144, and we will not here repeat the dis - cussion of these matters. As a result ot this change a switching charge of 60 cents per car on live stock to or from the stock yards was assessed, which charge was absorbed by the road haul lines. By our order in Application No. 38, entered December 8, 1908, we authorized the Union Stock Yards Company of South Omaha to increase the switching charge to 75 cents per car on live stock and also ordered the road haul lines to absorb the full amount. Again on September 16, 1910, effective Oc - tober 24, 1910, we granted the Union . Stock Yards Company of South Omaha authority to increase this switching charge to $1.00 per car and ordered connecting lines to absorb the full amount. In the order in Application No. 38, we referred to the fact that the proposed switching charges were similar to those In effect at other </seg>
            <seg id="p031">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION stock yards in this territory and such proposed charges would have the effect of maintaining a parity in the general basis of switching charges and absorptions. This parity, in so far aS the absorptions at South Omaha are concerned, has been destroyed and complainants seek to again be placed on an equal footing with the other markets. On June 12, 1918, upon Application 3437, filed by the Union Stock Yards Company of South Omaha, we entered an order authorizing an increase in the. live stock switching charge to $1.50 per car and in con - nection with, the . absorption of such charge had the following to say: "As to who should bear the burden of the increased rates, the Commission is' of the same opinion as expressed in previous orders. The railroads, under the law, are under obligation to pro - vide facilities for unloading live stock at South Omaha. Or - dinarily, they- provide their own facilities for this purpose, but at this point, they choose to lease facilities from applicant. In other words, the facilities of applicant constitute a common terminal for ali the carriers with which connections are maintained. Un - der the rate charged the shipper for transportation, the carrier should make deliveries and there should be no additional charge assessed against the shipper for switching service. The Commis - sion, therefore, finds that the increases herein authorized should be absorbed by the connecting carriers under the same rules and conditions as now apply to absorption under present rates. In view of the substantial increase of rates granted to the railroads by the director general of railroads to become effective. June 25, 1918, the requirements as to absorptions cannot be held to be un - reasonable." Carriers filed objections to the requirement that they absorb the full amount of the switching charges authorized in Application 3437, and on June 24, 1918, appeared before this Commission and presented tes - timony covering their objection. Due to the fact that the carriers were being taken over by the Federal government during a time of war, it was deemed inadvisable to at that time enforce the order requiring con - necting lines to absorb the full amount of the live stock switching charge previously authorized in Application 3437. There were no further changes in the general situation until August 27, 1920, when under I. C. C. Docket, Ex Parte 74, a thirty-five per cent increase in all interstate rates was authorized by the Interstate Commerce Commission. This Commission in Application 4299, took similar action but allowed only a twenty-five per cent increase. In' I. C. C. Docket .11829, under a 13th Section proceeding, all Nebraska Intrastate rates, including these spe - cific switching rates, were increased a full thirty-five per cent, making the switching charge of the Union Stock Yards Company $2.00 per car on live stock and the carriers amount of absorption $1.50 per car. On July 1, 1922, the switching rates as well as other rates were reduced 10 per cent, making the new switching charge of the Union Stock Yards Company on live stock $1.82 per car and the amount nf absorption $1.35 per car, the difference, or 47 cents per car, being the amount passed </seg>
            <seg id="p032">TWENTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT back to the shippers and receivers of live stock. On May 5, 1922, as we had agreed to make all rates then in effect the lawful rates for Nebraska, the Interstate Commerce Commission vacated its 13th Sec - tion proceeding again giving the Nebraska Commission jurisdiction over the Nebraska rates. Before the question regarding the full absorption of the switching charges of the Union Stock Yards Company could again be taken up by this Commission following the hearing of the carriers in Application 3437, Resolution 74 was entered on September 27, 1922, calling for an investigation of all intrastate live stock rates. This resolution was necessary because the Interstate Commerce Com - mission had already instituted a similar proceeding in I. C. C. Docket 13273. On May 3, 1924, we entered our permissive opinion and finding au - thorizing the carriers to publish specific rates to South Omaha. In that order we said: " — Distances to South Omaha stock yards shall govern the rates. "It is expected that the carriers will publish specific rates from the respective points of origin to final destination and not merely a distance scale. The scales here set forth are not intended for such rigid application as would prevent meeting short line, or reasonable cross-country, competition." Under the statutes, no change in the Nebraska rates, rules or regulation can be made by the carriers without first securing permission from the Nebraska State Railway Commission. The permission granted in Resolution 74 must therefore be construed as an order of this Com - mission. When we indicated in that order that the rates should be published as specific rates to South Omaha it was our intention that these rates, the same as other rates, included line haul ' and terminal costs, which meant that the live stock moving on the new rates should be delivered to the unloading chutes of the stock yards, that being the only available unloading or loading place at South Omaha. The record shows that of all the carriers moving live stock into South Omaha, under the Resolution 74 rates, the Missouri Pacific Railroad Corporation in Nebraska was the only line complying with the order. It was and is delivering live stock to the unloading chutes of the stock yards by ab - sorbing the full amount of the switching charges. The failure of the other lines to absorb in full, the switching charge of the Union Stock Yards Company is, in essence, a failure to complete delivery of the live stock to South Omaha at the rates applicable to South Omaha, and therefore a violation of the terms of the order in Resolution 74, which results in damages to the shippers and receivers of live stock at South Omaha, by reason of the fact that such shippers and receivers are re - quired to pay 47 cents per car more than the lawful rates in effect. In a preceding paragraph we have indicated that South Omaha has </seg>
            <seg id="p033">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION been ranked as the second largest live stock market in the United States. This means that a greater volume of traffic moves into and out of South Omaha than to other. markets outside of the Chicago mar - ket, which presupposes economics in operation tending to reduce the expense of handling the traffic. This, in our opinion, considering traf - fic and transportation conditions, would entitle South Omaha to a some - what lower scale of rates. Yet the same level of rates to South Omaha, distance considered, applies to other markets on the Missouri River. The markets at Sioux City and St. Joseph are also served by ter - minal railways and their charges for the terminal switching of live stock are $1.82 and $1.80 per car respectively Since the hearings In these cases the charge at Sioux City has been increased to $2.00 per car, the full amount of which is absorbed by all rOad haul carriers. The South Omaha market is in competition with the markets of Sioux City and St. Joseph, and it cannot be said in justice to the market and the shippers to and from the market that because the market has prospered the imposition of the additional unabsorbed switch - ing charge complained of is not harmful. The fact that the market had prospered does not warrant discrimination against it, either great or small. Defendants refer to the fact that the 47 cents per car passed back to the shipper is insignificant in amount and would not have any effect whatever upon the traffic. We are not impressed with this argument. On each car it is perhaps true that the 47 cents would not amount to much but when we multiply the 47 cents against 55 per cent of 118,501 cars, the in and out bound intrastate cars at South Omaha it is to be -noted that the amount reaches about $30,000.00 dollars per year based on the 1928 figures. Therefore, it does become a significant amount and is a charge that should not be lost in the so-called "shuffle", and we adhere to the principle that a carrier that serves similarly situated points cannot lawfully prefer one to the disadvantage of the other. There is another inconsistency in the position of the defendants that warrants mention, if competitive conditions compelled the carriers to absorb the full amount of the switching charges at the other markets, how can it be said that the small amount involved in connection with shipments to the South Omaha market is of no consequence to shippers who patronize the South Omaha market? Defendants contend that the line haul rates on live stock to and from Missouri River markets are on a low basis and that absorption of switching charges at none of the markets should be required in connection with the present level of the rates. They stress particularly the rates from Nebraska and make numerous comparisons with rates in Central Freight Association territory prescribed by the Interstate Commerce Commission, wherein they show that the rates in Central </seg>
            <seg id="p034">TWENTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT Freight Association territory, are higher than in Nebraska, and advocate the theory that the rates in Central Freight Association territory should be lower because of the much greater traffic density of the lines in that territory. The facts show that the traffic density of live stock is much greater in Nebraska than in Central Freight Association territory. Defendants also take the position that the rates now in effect to South Omaha, prescribed in I. C. C. Docket 13273, were not suggested by the Interstate Commerce Commission as reasonable maximum rates. This is true, but the fact 1b that the issues in I. C. C. Docket 13273 and in Resolution 74 did not involve the reasonableness of the live stock rates per se. The Interstate Commerce Commission, instituting its investigation in I. C. C. Docket 13273 on its own motion, inquired : "Into the matter of the relationship between the interstate and intrastate rates on ordinary live stock, in carloads, from all Nebraska points to Omaha and South Omaha, Nebraska, and the interstate rates from the sarnie points of origin to Kansas City and St Joseph, Mo., and Sioux City, Iowa, with a view to prescrib - ing such rates from and to the said points of origin and destina - tion as will remove any undue prejudice to, or undue preference of, Kansas City and St. Joseph, Mo., Omaha and South Omaha, Nebraska, or Sioux City, Iowa, and receivers of live stock located thereat and any unjust discrimination against interstate com - merce." and this Commission in its opinion and finding in Resolution 74 had the following to say regarding the Investigation: "The scope of our investigation in this cause was indicated in the order Instituting the proceedings, wherein it was stated 'that the Nebraska State Railway Commission enter upon an in - vestigation of intrastate rates on ordinary live stock in carloads in Nebraska in their relation to each other and to rates to in-, terstate markets and distances from the same points of origin to the end that undue discrimination, unreasonable preference, and inequalities may be corrected so far as practicable upon the record there made.' " "Much testimony presented by the carriers had. to do with reasonableness of live stock rates per se. This investigation was not so broad. It is our understanding that the scope of the in - vestigation, instituted by the Interstate Commerce Commission in its Docket 13273, was likewise limited to the elimination of prefer - ential and discriminatory conditions In the live stock rate fabric to Missouri river markets." In a former case, and to which this Commission was not a party, I. C. C. Docket 12048, 69 I. C« C. 688, referred to as the "Omaha Case", the Omaha Live Stock exchange asked for an order compelling the carriers to absorb the entire amount of the switching charges assessed by the Union Stock Yards Company and which was denied under date of July 10, 1922. At that time, the line haul rates on live stock from points in Nebraska to South Omaha were held to be on a lower level </seg>
            <seg id="p035">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION than the rates to Sioux City and St. Joseph, but since the decision in I. C. C. Docket 13273, 89 I. C. C. 444 (and to which this Commission was a party, the line haul rates to all Missouri river markets were placed on an equality, distance considered. This places an entirely different aspect on the situation involved herein. The rates to South Omaha, generally speaking, were increased to the basis in effect to the competitive markets of Sioux City and St. Joseph as prescribed by the Interstate Commerce Commission in Docket 13273. It is clearly shown that the switching service and competitive conditions at the three markets are substantially alike and the altered conditions wholly remove any justification for following the former de - cision of the Interstate Commerce Commission in so far as Nebraska intrastate traffic is concerned. Whatever differences in conditions may now exist are . generally favorable to the carriers in transporting live stock to South Omaha. In its decision in Dockets 22405, 22458 and 22800 the Interstate Commerce Commission, while entering no order, provided that the new rates to the Missouri river markets prescribed in I. C. C. Docket 17000, Rate Structure Investigation, Part 9, Livestock — Western District Rates, as reasonable maximum rates, and preserving the present equality, dis - tance considered, between competing markets, should include delivery to the unloading chutes of the Union Stock Yards Company without the assessment of the additional switching charges of the South Omaha Terminal Railway. This Commission in Application 9352, an applica - tion of all Nebraska roads to publish the new interstate live stock rates on Nebraska intrastate traffic, has provided that the new rates, effective November 1, 1932, shall include delivery to the unloading chutes of the Union Stock Yards Company.- In other words, under the new rates to South Omaha, whether state or interstate, carriers must absorb the full amount of the switching charge of the South Omaha Terminal Railway. We find upon the facts submitted, that the practice of the defendants in failing to absorb the entire amount of the switching charges, assessed by the South Omaha Terminal Railway, on shipments ot live stock, in carloads, from and to points in Nebraska on the one hand and South Omaha on the other, was and is unjust, unreasonable, unjustly discrim - inatory, unduly preferential and otherwise unlawful. We further find that the shippers and receivers who paid and bore the adidtional charges herein complained of, or 47 cents per car, in addition to the lawful line haul rates to or from South Omaha have been damaged in the amount of such charges and under Chapter 75-510 of Compiled Statutes of Nebraska 1929, are entitled to reparation.

BY THE COMMISSION: ' STATEMENT OF FACTS Complaint in this case was filed in behalf of the Brotherhood of Railway Trainmen by J. F. Moredick, a citizen of Nebraska and a duly authorized representative of said organization. The complaint alleges that trains Nos. 510 and 511, operated by the defendant company, con - stitute passenger trains, and that they are operating without full crews, as provided by law. The parties agreed as to the train schedules and the number of members of the crews operating said trains, but the defendant disagreed with the complainant in that it alleged that trains in question are motor trains which are not governed by any specific law in the statute books and that the trains are adequately manned to protect safety of and service to the crews, the- railway company, and the traveling public. This case was set for hearing and was heard on February 23,' 1932. Thereafter and on July 11, 1932, by agreement of counsel for the In - terested parties, oral argument was heard by the Commission and the matter was taken under advisement. OPINION It appears to the Commission that the point upon which this case hinges is whether or not trains Nos. 510 and 511 are passenger trains within the meaning of Section 74-519, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1929. A careful check of the decisions of the Nebraska Supreme Court does not disclose any opinion covering this point. There being no decisions of said Court upon the point at issue, the Commission submitted the specific question of law to the Attorney General, who, by statute, is the legal counsel for the Railway Commission. In the opinion of the Attorney General, trains Nos. 510 and 511 are passenger trains within the meaning of said Section 74-519. Investigation of the evidence in the case discloses that according to the definition of a "train", found on page 7 of the defendant's book of rules, which definition reads as follows: "A train. An engine or motor car or more than one engine or motor car coupled, with, or without cars, displaying markers." the train in question is a passenger train. The common sense interpretation of the defendant's above quoted rule agreeing with the statute, as interpreted by the Attorney General, </seg>
            <seg id="p039">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION the Commission is of the opinion and therefore finds that trains Nos. 510 and 611 are passenger trains whose regular equipment consist of less than five cars, and that the defendant' company is operating said trains without the full crew as provided by law. The Commission feels that an order should issue ordering the defendant to .desist from the violation of said law and that the finding of this Commission that the law has been violated should be reported to the proper prosecuting authorities of the state of Nebraska for prosecution under Section 74-622, C. S. of 1929. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Com - mission that the defendant railroad company comply with Section 74-519 and provide trains Nos. 510 and 511, referred to in the complaint in this case and considered throughout this case, with a full crew, as pro - vided by Section 74-519, for trains whose regular equipment consists of five cars or less. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Attorney General of the state of Nebraska be advised that on the 13th day of October, 1931, and other times subsequent thereto, the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway Com - pany did operate over its road in Nebraska, outside of the yard limits, a passenger train, carrying passengers, whose regular equipment con - sisted of less than five cars, without a crew constituted as prescribed by Section 74-519, C. S. of 1929, and in violation of Section 74-522, C. S. of 1929. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Com - mission that the records and files of the Commission in this case be and ' they hereby are made available to the Attorney General of the State of Nebraska for his use in prosecuting the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway Company for violation of any and all criminal statutes which he may find have been violated.

            <seg id="p041">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION FORMAL COMPLAINT 716. Cass County, et al., Complainants, v. Missouri Pacific Corporation in Nebraska, Defendant. COMMISSIONER DRAKE PRESIDING. BY THE COMMISSION: Pursuant to notice previously given, this matter came on for hear - ing August 12, 1932, before Commissioner Drake, in the offices of the Commission. Complainants are the county commissioner of Cass, Otoe, Nemaha and Richardson counties together with Binger Lumber &amp; Coal Co. of Weeping Water, M. H. Lum of Avoca, A. Graham Lumber Co. of Falls City, the Towle Lumber Co. of Falls City and the Independent Lumber Company of Falls City. By complaint filed July 15, 1932, it is alleged that the present rates on sand, gravel and crushed stone, carloads, from Louisville to many destinations on the line of the Missouri Pacific Rail - road Corporation in Nebraska are unreasonable, discriminatory and un - lawful. Complainants seek a reasonable, nondiscriminatory and non - prejudicial scale of rates on sand, gravel and crushed stone on a basis as favorable as rates maintained by other carriers into the same general territory, as well as to other territories within the state. The scale proposed by complainants based upon Western Trunk Line Committee docket advice 5319-D would result in the following specific rates to the points at which complainants seek to have emergency rates established. These emergency rates not to be subject to the absorption of connect - ing line switching i charges at points of origin or destination.

Gorder, J. E. Waller, F. H. Effkln, Clyde M. Curtis and J. A. Little, showed that at the present time there are numerous road side pits producing sand and gravel fol the graveling of public highways in the counties named and also for the commercial trade at various points; that the gravel produced at these road side pits is being transported by trucks for varying distances; that many of the material dealers doing business at stations on de - fendant's lines are subjected to competition with material dealers lo - cated at cross country stations on the line of the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad at which points rates have been materially reduced in order to meet truck and road side pit competition and that said dealers will be unable to compete with such other dealers located on the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad, nor will they be able to compete with road side pits unless the rates are reduced; that there are many roads to be maintained, graveled or paved in this section of the state, which projects will require large quantities of sand, gravel or crushed stone and unless the present rates are materially reduced a large percentage of this traffic will move via truck rather than rail; that as a general policy wherever there has been a road project the carriers have applied to this Commission for authority to reduce the rates to the basis of the emergency scale; that reduced rates have been established to about 140 stations on the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy, 100 stations on the Chicago &amp; North Western, 27 stations on the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific, 25 stations on the Union Pacific and about 7 stations on the Missouri Pacific Railroad Corporation in </seg>
            <seg id="p043">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION Nebraska; that defendant still- assesses the regular Nebraska mileage scale to all other stations on its line, which scale Is about 30 cents per ton higher than the reduced scale now applicable to about 292 stations in Nebraska; that there are at the present time three different rate levels applying from the Platte river pits to different parts of Cass county. As an illustration, there is a rate of 40 cents per ton from Louisville to Greenwood, a point on the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad, and at the same time a rate of 45 cents and 70 cents per ton from Louisville, for like hauls, to stations on' the Missouri Pacific Rail - road Corporation in Nebraska; that this condition creates a discrim - inatory, unduly preferential and prejudicial rate situation whereby In some instances road contractors are able to secure their gravel from a given producing point at a lower cost, to some points, than they are to other equal distant points; that during the last three or four years the Missouri Pacific Railroad Corporation in Nebraska has lost 60 per cent of the available business due to its failure to establish emergency reduced rates to meet truck or road side pit competition; that in 1931 the so-called emergency scale applied for distances up to 100 miles but due to the longer hauls In 1932 it was necessary to extend the emergency scale to 200 miles; that defendant now maintains rates to most stations on its line within the 200 mile zone which are ma - terially higher than the emergency scale used by the Chicago, Burling - ton &amp; Quincy Railroad in establishing rates to stations on its line located in the same general territory as' well as to other stations on its lines located in other parts of the state; that the defendant has in several instances published emergency reduced rates on sand, gravel and crushed stone from Louisville to a few of its stations in southeast Nebraska. As an illustration, it is shown that the rate from Louisville to Eagle is 50 cents per ton, whereas the Nebraska scale would make 70 cents per ton and that the emergency rate to Falls City Is 90 cents per ton or 20 cents below the regular scale. The evidence shows that this 90 cents per ton rate to Falls City is also subject to the absorption of the connecting line switching charges at Louisville. Defendant offered testimony to the effect that the road side pits have not cut into their revenue tonnage to any great extent and that they have been able to secure all of the sand and gravel traffic in most Instances in spite of the road side pit or truck competition; that during the period January to November, 1931, defendant has moved a total of 4,844 cars from Louisville and Weeping Water to various destinations on its rails. Rebuttal testimony relating to the volume was offered by witness Curtis to the effect that this total movement constituted only about one-half of what the defendant would have moved if it had not been for the truck or road side pit competition. Witness for the defendant signified his willingness to establish the so-called Docket 17,000-, Part 2, sand and gravel scale, as set forth In </seg>
            <seg id="p044">TWENTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT Exnibit "K" introduced by Witness Flansburg in Resolution No. 122. A check of that scale indicates that It is considerably higher than the so called emergency scale now being used to move a substantial volume of sand and gravel within the state. Witness also testified that the Missouri Pacific Railroad Corporation In Nebraska had established emergency rates to meet the cross country competition established by other railroads in this territory and that where such emergency rates have been established it is their intention to maintain these emergency rates as long as they are maintained by competitive lines. As an example, it was pointed out that the defendant company had established an emergency rate of 45 cents per ton on sand and gravel from Louisville to Omaha, Nebraska, which rate is sub - ject to the absorption of connecting line switching charges. On cross examination witness for the defendant admitted that rates should be the same for equal hauls if the traffic and transportation con - ditions were the same and that in his opinion more service was accorded shipments moving from Louisville to Omaha than would be used on shipments moving from Louisville to stations south and west of Louis - ville. CONCLUSIONS No evidence having been offered as to the reasonableness per se of the proposed rates we' are unable to determine from this record whether or not such proposed rates are reasonable, maximum rates and will not at this time pass upon that phase of the complaint but will confine our effort to determining whether or not undue prejudice or preference exists in the rates into southeastern Nebraska. In connection with the establishment of emergency rates through - out Nebraska we desire to point out that whenever a carrier has filed an emergency application with this Commission they have invariably stated that the rates applied for are not considered by them as reason - able, maximum rates for the movement of sand and gravel, but that such rates are for the express purpose of meeting truck or road side pit competition thereby enabling carrier to participate In the movement of the traffic. All of the so called emergency rates have been made to expire not later than December 31, 1932, unless sooner changed or cancelled. Checking the proposed rates submitted on behalf of the complain - ants with the emergency rates now in effect, we find that the carriers have not in all instances used the so-called emergency scale as a maxi - mum but have published out rates somewhat higher. This leads us to the conclusion that the so-called emergency scale for general applica - tion into this territory would be somewhat low. </seg>
            <seg id="p045">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION In our opinion, this record clearly shows that there is a discrim - inatory, unduly prejudicial and preferential rate situation which should be corrected, both in the interest of the defendant and the shippers and consumers of sand, gravel and crushed stone used in either road projects or building activities. We, therefore, conclude that the only way in which this discriminatory, unduly prejudicial or preferential situ - ation against the southeast Nebraska interests can be corrected is to prescribe as an emergency a reduction in the present rates from Louis - ville to other points in the southeast territory on the defendant's line, where emergency rates have not been established. This, we believe, will help to preserve the carrier's revenue and will, at the same time, afford the Platte river producers and jobbers of sand, gravel and crushed stone a chance to compete with the road side pits on an equitable rate adjustment. We are of the opinion and so find that, owing to the present condi - tions surrounding this particular traffic, the following specific emergency rates should he published from Louisville, Nebraska: Rate, Cents Per Ton To ' from Louisville, Nebraska Manley .45 Weeping Water .45 Nehawka .45 Union .45 Murray ■■ .45 Mynard .45 Elmwood .50 Eagle .50 Walton 50 Avoca 45 Otoe . .45 Dunbar 50 Lorton 50 Talmage -50 Brock 55 Glen Rock .55 Auburn . -60 Wyoming -50 Nebraska City 50 Paul .55 Julian ...... 60 Howe .65 Stella . .70 Verdon .80 </seg>

After due notice, hearing was held and the complaint was dismissed upon findings that the reduction of rates by the M.

FORMAL COMPLAINT NO. 719. O.le Olson, Complainant, v. Missouri Pacific Railroad Corporation in Nebraska, Defendant. OPINION AND FINDING. BY THE COMMISSION: Pursuant to notice previously given, this case came on for hearing December 14, 1932, before Chairman Randall, at the office of the Com - mission. Complainant alleges by complaint filed November 3, 1932, that the rates charged for the transportation of rip-rap stone from complainant's quarries at Nehawka to Omaha were, when exacted, and are unjust, unreasonable and discriminatory, unduly prejudicial to Nehawka, and unduly preferential of Weeping Water. Complainant seeks nonpreju - dicial rates and reparation. Complainant testified' that he operates stone quarries at both Weep - ing Water and Nehawka and ships stone from both quarles to Omaha. The distance from Nehawka to Omaha is 44.4 miles figured via Union, and from Weeping Water to Omaha 39.1 miles via Springfield. Both points are within. the 50 mile zone to Omaha. On shipments of stone from Nehawka to Omaha the present rate is 60 cents per ton plus an emergency surcharge of 6 cents per ton making the total rate 66 cents per ton, whereas on shipments from Weeping Water to Omaha an emer - gency rate of 45 cents per ton applies. No surcharge Is added to the rate from Weeping Water. An emergency rate comparable with the rate from Weeping Water to Omaha is requested for application from Nehawka to Omaha. There has been shipped from Nehawka to Omaha twenty-one cars of rip-rap stone consigned to the Kansas City Bridge Company for a government project on the Missouri River. Four more cars were to move from Nehawka to Omaha on December 14, 1932. The </seg>
            <seg id="p048">TWENTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT irelgnt charges on the shipments mentioned are paid at .Omaha by the Kansas City Bridge Company and deducted from the Invoice when re - mittance is made. The Western Limestone Product Company is located at Weeping Water and is in direct competition with Complainant at Nenawka. The establishing of complainant's quarry at Nehawka was due to the dis - covery of a better hill of stone with a plentiful supply and tested by the state as very good. The present investment in equipment at Nehawka is a little over $1,000.00. The investment will be increased to $25,000.00 very shortly by putting in a crushing plant. At the present time the quarry employes about 25 men. With the installation of a crusher it will necessitate the employment of about 60 men. The gov - ernment project now in operation on the Missouri River, directed by the Kansas City Bridge. Company, will require close to 1,000 cars of rip-rap stone. • Mr. G. A. Rutledge, newspaper publisher at Nehawka, testified that he has been handling complainant's correspondence and had up the mat - ter of freight rates with the traffic officials of the Missouri Pacific Railroad Company requesting that the rate from Nehawka be reduced so it would be the same as from Weeping Water, but did not receive any cooperation at all. Defendant advised Mr. Rutledge by letter that it had no information of a quarry being operated at Nehawka. In the absence of any appearances on behalf of the Missouri Pacific Railroad Corporation in Nebraska, defendant, it was deemed . advisable to incorporate into the record two applications filed by its general freight agent, wherein authority was requested for permission to pub - lish reduced rates on sand, gravel and stone from Weeping Water to Omaha. The rates to be published on one day's notice. The first ap - plication, number 9578, dated April 5, 1932, requested authority to pub - lish a rate of 45 cents per ton of 2,000 pounds on sand, gravel and crushed stone, such rate to Include deliveries on connecting lines within the switching limits of Omaha. In explanation of the application it was stated that it was for the purpose of placing the proaucer at Weep - ing Water on a competitive basis with the producer at Louisville. The application was authorized by the Commission under date of April 9, 1932. The second application, number 9862, dated October 5, 1932, sought authority to publish a rate of 45 cents per ton of 2,000 pounds on rip-rap stone from Weeping Water and Louisville to Omaha, applicable only via the applicant's line through Springfield. In support of the application it was stated that advice had been received that the C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co. would attempt to secure necessary authority for the publication or a 45 cent rate on rip-rap stone from Louisville to Omaha and under the circumstances defendant desired the same basis from Weeping Water In order to place the Weeping Water Stone producer on an equitable </seg>
            <seg id="p049">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION basis with the Louisville producer. It was further stated that it was understood a contract would soon be let for quite a bit ot rip rap stone to be used in the government river project at Omaha and in view thereof authority was requested to publish the 45 cent rate from Louisville and Weeping Water, effective on one day's notice. This application was authorized by the Commission on October 8, 1932. No evidence was offered as to the reasonableness per se of the rates involved, therefore the prayer for reparation must be denied. We find that the rates charged for the transportation of rip-rap stone, carloads, from Nehawka to Omaha are and for the future will be unduly prejudicial to shippers at Nehawka, and unduly preferential of shippers at Louisville and Weeping Water. We further find that this undue prejudice can be removed by the establishment of a rate of 45 cents per ton of 2,000 pounds, not subject to the emergency surcharge, on rip-rap stone, carloads, from Nehawka to Omaha. We further find that an emergency exists and the 45 cent rate pro - posed in the preceding paragraph should be authorized upon less than statutory notice. An appropriate order will be entered. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Com - mission that the Missouri Pacific Railroad Corporation in Nebraska be and the same is hereby authorized and directed to publish a rate of 45 cents per ton of 2,000 pounds, not subject to the emergency surcharge, on rip-rap Stone, carloads, from Nehawka to Omaha, the minimum carload weight to be the same as that now applicable from Weeping Water to Omaha. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED an emergency existing that this order shall become effective on and after ten days from the date hereof.

Hear - ing held May 13, 1932, by Chairman Randall. Withdrawn by applicant; dismissed December 1, 1933. APPLICATION NO. 9601 In the Matter of- the Application of the Yellow Cab &amp; Baggage Co., et al., of Omaha, Nebraska, for regulations governing the operation of common carriers of passengers by motor vehicles, particularly taxicabs. OPINION AND FINDINGS BY THE COMMISSION: STATEMENT The applicant in this case is the Yellow Cab &amp; Baggage Company of Omaha, Nebraska, requesting the promulgation of fair and adequate regulations governing the operation of common carriers by motor ve - hicles, submitting the following alleged facts. I. "Applicant files this Application on its own behalf and on be - half of all companies in the state of of Nebraska operating in municipalities and their environs as common carriers of passengers by motor vehicles of any and all characters. II. "Applicant, for the past twenty-two (22) years, has been en - gaged in the city of Omaha, as a common' carrier of passengers by motor vehicles, and particularly by motor vehicles commonly designated as taxi cabs. """ "Applicant has a large investment in this business and oper - ates seventy-eight (78) taxi cabs and daily serves a material pro - portion ot the people of Omaha, as well as visitors coming into ' and leaving the city. III. "Throughout the state of Nebraska, in the various municipali - ties, a great many companies are engaged in the business of com - mon carriers of passengers by motor vehicles. These Companies have large investments in their businesses and are serving a material proportion of the people in the various municipalities in which they operate, as well as a material proportion of the vis - itors coming into and leaving the respective cities. rv. "Because of the severe economic depression which has ob - tained throughout the country for the past two years, and is still continuing, competitive methods have come about which threaten the financial stability of all common carriers of passen- </seg>
            <seg id="p091">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION gers by motor vehicles and threaten to destroy this very neces - sary service to the people of the state. V. "The people of the state of Nebraska, in Section 20 of Article IV of the state constitution, conferred on your honorable body jurisdiction over the 'rates, service and general control of common carriers', and which jurisdiction includes within its purview ap - plicant and all other companies engaged in the business of trans - porting passengers as common carriers by motor vehicles. "Heretofore, your honorable body has exercised jurisdiction in these premises in its Resolution No. 110, wherein the carrying of adequate insurance policies to protect the public against in - juries to person and property were required of common carriers of passengers by motor vehicles, and such exercise of jurisdiction was approved by the supreme court of the state of Nebraska, pur - suant to the authority of said Article IV, Section 20 of the consti - tution of Nebraska. "Your honorable body also exercised jurisdiction in these prem - ises by passing on the securities issue of companies engaged in the transportation of passengers by motor vehicles as common car - riers pursuant to provisions of Chapter 75, Article 12 (Gen. Sec. 75-1201 to 1203, inclusive) of the Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1929. VI. "A group of men from outside the city and state have come into Omaha and are promoting a plan of common carriage of pas - sengers by motor vehicles, the effect of which would cause a dis - astrous loss to all existing taxicab companies and to the local street railway company, and would generally demoralize the transporta - tion system of passengers in Omaha. "Under the proposed plan, drivers of cars of all characters are solicited to operate under this system in the manner following — the owners of the cars so persuaded to join In the movement must comply with the following principal conditions — a. Make a cash deposit of $25.00. . b. Obtain all of their gasoline and oil from the system company and pay for same. c. Have all of their automobile repairs done in the system shop and pay for same. d. Pay $3.00 cash per day to the system company for the privilege of operating under or as a part of the system. The system company provides the following principal items — a. The painting of the upper half of the automobiles whose owners join in the system. b. Furnishing caps and badges to the owners of the cars. c. The furnishing of a common phone for the receiving and transmitting of applications for carriage. </seg>
            <seg id="p092">90 TWENTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT d. Liability insurance with maximum coverage of $5,000 and $10,000. "The manner of operating the system is generally as follows — "The city of Omaha is divided into arbitrary areas, called zones, and without reference to the distance covered, time con - sumed, differing charges are imposed for and on account of travel within and to and from the various zones, such districting of the city of Omaha into zones being purely arbitrary and being in fact unreasonable in its application, to the prejudice of the passenger or passengers in many respects. The automobiles which are oper - ated under the system are not In fact devised -for motor carrier transportation and in the main are unsuitable for this character of transportation, being converted private, used, passenger automo - biles. The operation of the system results in extremely long hours to the driver proprietors of the cars in order to realize each day the charges required to be paid to the promoters, plus gasoline, oil and. repair expense, and leave anything at all to such owner operator. Under this plan the overhead expense of the promoting company will not be increased by additions to the number of cars operated, with the result that shortly the streets of the city will be overrun with automobiles engaging in this plan, with the ulti - mate result that the undue competition will prevent any operator of a common carrier passenger vehicle from earning a reasonable return for the service rendered. "In consequence, the existing agencies will be financially harmed and rendered less able to give efficient service, and the owners of vehicles who immediately share in the plan, will find themselves in a few months with run down automobiles, and no reserve fund provided to replace the cars. Nevertheless,' with a rapid turnover in operators under such system, experience in other cities under this plan demonstrates that because of present em - ployment conditions the system experience a rapid, "mushroom growth, with a profit to the organizers or promoters only and ul - timate disaster to all other interests. Including the owner drivers, and the demoralization of the transportation of passengers by motor vehicle common carriers. "In addition, under the system, any owner operator retiring from the service of the promoters or organizers will be unable to re-engage in common carriage by reason of the terms of the agree - ment limiting and restraining his ability so to do for eighteen months after the termination of his relationship with this system. "The same, as well as substantially similar systems of opera - tion have been exploited in other cities of the United States, with uniformly the same results. Thus, in Washington, D. C, a city adequately served with 700 taxicabs, under the operations of this system the number of taxicabs rapidly grew to 4,000, a rate war resulted, discriminatory and vicious solicitation practices were inaugurated in the fierce competition for passengers; the prior established transportation agencies were demoralized and unable further to render fair and adequate service; zone systems of vari - ous areas were inaugurated, to the confusion ot the public, which confusion' was played upon by operators to defraud the public,' and notwithstanding freqent changes in the zone areas, not any zone system was established which was hot in a substantial per- </seg>
            <seg id="p093">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION centage of cases, prejudicial to the passenger or passengers, con - sidering the distance traveled or service rendered. The gross rev - enues of the Old Line Taxicab Companies fell more than $500,000 in 1930 from the 1929 figure, a reduction in gross of almost one - third, with a net loss increase of about $3,000 in 1929 and nearly $40,000 in 1930.' "In Baltimore, Maryland, the number of motor carriers like - wise rapidly grew from 400 to 1700, with uniformly the same results. "Like conditions have prevailed In other cities where the system or plan was inaugurated. "In Wichita, Kansas, the largest established agency suffered a loss of 60% of passenger volume with the inauguration of such a- plan or system. "Attached hereto, marked as exhibits, and by reference made ' a part hereof, and in support of the foregoing, are — "Exhibit A, being a specimen agreement between the organizer promoters operating under the name of 'Publix Cars', a Nebraska corporation, and the driver. "Exhibit B, being a repeatedly run advertisement, soliciting owners of used passenger automobiles for such service. "Exhibit C, being newspaper articles covering interviews by the organizers and . promoters, indicating the proposed extent of operation and the rapid expansion of the number of automobiles operated under such system of 100 cars or units. "Exhibit D, being a newspaper advertisement describing and mapping the zones and fares applicable thereto. "Exhibit E and F, being announcements of the inauguration of a similar system in the city of Denver, Colorado, which, how - ever, was subject to regulation and compelled to comply with rea - sonable regulatory measures affecting alike all members of the industry. VII. "The conditions surrounding the transportation in Omaha of passengers by motor vehicles as common carriers has become so acute from an economic and operating standpoint that, together with the aforedescribed destructive plan, the life of the industry is in immediate jeopardy and public convenience and safety is in . danger of great disturbance. In consequence of all of this an ' emergency exists requiring immediate remedial relief, and the exercise of your honorable body of the jurisdiction conferred in the premises by the constitution of Nebraska." The application had attached thereto, as co-signers, a number of taxicab operators in Omaha, Nebraska, alleging that, such operators represented all of the taxicab operators in Omaha, who had complied with the orders of the Nebraska State Railway Commission heretofore entered, concerning tabicab operations. These operators requested that they he made party applicants in this proceeding. </seg>
            <seg id="p094">TWENTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT There was thereafter filed, a petition of intervention by the Omaha &amp; Council Bluffs Street Railway Company, setting up the following facts, to-wit: I. "Intervenor is engaged as a common carrier of passengers by street railway cars and motor busses within the city of Omaha, Nebraska, and is subject to the regulatory orders of your honorable body. U. "Intervenor has been furnishing mass transportation to the citizens of Omaha for many years past with an investment in its property of approximately $14,100,000, as last fixed -by your honor - able body. In rendering a street railway service to the citizens of Omaha, Nebraska, it employs approximately 1,000 employees. "On account of changes in the riding habits of people gener - ally and in particular because of the. increase in motor vehicles, the volume of business of intervenor has been constantly decreas - ing as demonstrated by reports on file with your honorable body, and it has been necessary to increase the rates of intervenor by orders of your honorable body from time to time, although the rates so fixed have not only been insufficient to yield a fair return upon the fair value of the property devoted to the transporta - tion service of the people of the city of Omaha, but such rates have been inadequate to yield a revenue sufficient to meet all operating expenses and fixed charges, including tax burdens of approximately $350,000 per year. "By reason of the diminution in revenue, the bond holders of intervenor have formed a reorganization committee to consider and act upon the financial situation of intervenor and such com - mittee Is now giving consideration to the problem. III. "The common carriage of passengers by motor vehicles, and in particular, by taxicabs and public cars, has not heretofore been a serious encroachment upon the field of mass transportation served by intervenor on account of the relatively higher rates of such taxicabs and public cars and on account of such taxicabs and public cars serving in the field of individual or taxicab trans - ' portation. IV . "It is proposed in Omaha to organize and promote a plan of common carriage of passengers by motor vehicle whereby owners of all characters of private, used passenger automobiles, for a fixed dally charge to certain promoters and organizers, entering the state of Nebraska for the first time, and in the city of Omaha in particular for the first time, would engage in the business of common carriage of passengers by motor vehicles under a com - mon name, with a common telephone, without regulation of fares, without the equipment ordinarily requisite for standard taxicab companies and without any fixed capital investment proportionate to the other transportation systems or organized business activi - ties and on a so-called zone system of fares ruinously low and ar- </seg>
            <seg id="p095">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION bltrary as to distance covered or service rendered to the prejudice of the passengers. "By reason of the entry of such a. system of transportation into the entire field of transportation — both mass and individual — such system of transportation aS last described would be in active competition with intervenor and because the inauguration of such a system in the city of Omaha would compel cut-rate competition by all other organized and established agencies, and in particular, taxicab companies, the intervenor would be in competition with the entire taxicab industries for the first time in its history. V. "The inauguration of similar systems of transportation in other cities has had the effect of producing active competition with street railway companies, with a resultant large loss of revenue to the street railway companies. Thus, in Washington, D. C, the introduction of cut-rate zone cabs with low zone rates, re - duced the joint revenues of the two street railway companies serving that city approximately $100,000 per month and motor busses operated in the same city suffered an 18 per cent decrease in volume of passenger traffic directly due to this new form of competition. In Wichita, Kansas, where the cut-rate zone cab has been in operation but a relatively short time, the street rail - way company has suffered an immediate loss in passenger traffic of 20 per cent. In Seattle, Washington, during the height of the taxicab rate war, occasioned by the entry Into the field of a cut - rate zone cab, the' street railway company suffered a loss in rev - enue of approximately $800.00 a day. In Baltimore, Md., before effective - taxicab regulation by the Public Service Commission of the state of Maryland, the street railway company of said city was losing from $1500 to $4000 per day on account of a zone system of transportation by motor vehicle under the same or sub - stantially similar mode of operation. The same, or similar ex - perience has been encountered in other cities where this new type of transportation has entered to destroy the line of demarca - tion between mass transportation and individual transportation by taxicabs. "In addition to the foregoing revenue losses, discriminatory practices have been the necessary result of this new form of competition and in particular the practice of cruising along street railway transportation routes with solicitation of prospective pas - sengers assembled at termini and stops of street railway common carriers, has become a common practice. Thus, the patrons who would ordinarily ride the street cars or busses, through the per - nicious practice of this new system of transportation and in par - ticular through the device of selling seats in such cut-rate zone cabs are lost to street railway companies, without such cut-rate zone cabs being compelled to furnish a general city-wide service and with the rapid and uncontrolled expansion of such systems of cabs, excessive cruising is a natural consequence of the eco - nomic pressure on the owner or renter drivers without any rela - tion whatsoever to the public's requirements and to the serious detriment and crippling of the street railway transportation service </seg>
            <seg id="p096">TWENTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT VI. "Mass transportation service cannot be permanently replaced by Individual transportation service, at least in the absence of effective regulation of individual transportation service, and the situation therefore demands the effective regulation of the rates and service of individual transportation services, including all established taxicab companies and all new entrants into the taxi - cab field. VII. "The revenues of intervenor are so precariously low that an interruption of the revenues of intervenor or the substantial dim - inution of the revenues of intervenor for even a limited time, under the conditions aforesaid, and with a bondholders' committee investigating the situation of intervenor, might operate seriously to cripple the service of intervenor to the people of the city of Omaha and in consequence whereof an emergency exists requir - ing immediate remedial relief and the exercise of the jurisdiction of your honorable body over the transportation ot passengers by motor vehicles as common carriers, to avoid a disturbance of the continuity of the service being rendered by intervenor to the people of the city of Omaha." Thereafter, there was filed, a protest by Publix Cars. This protest alleged that it is a corporation in the city of Omaha, Nebraska, engaged in the business of maintaining and conducting a passenger transporta - tion service and system, for hire, upon the streets of that city, having been duly authorized and licensed to do such business by the proper authorities of said city. Protestant objects to the power and jurisdiction of this Commission to hear and determine, or enter any orders, in the matters set forth in the said application, and supplemental applications. This protestant further alleges that it had made application to, and re - ceived from the city of Omaha, a license and permit' to engage in the business of maintaining and conducting a transportation system, for hire, upon and over the streets of said city, under and pursuant to the ordinances, rules and regulations then and still in existence, relating to such business, and that said corporation had fully complied with all the requirements of said ordinances, in the matter of making such application for license and permit thereunder, paying the required license fee, and all other charges necessary to obtain such license and permit, and that it was granted, and obtained, and holds a permit or license from said city to conduct said business under said ordinance and amend - ments thereto, and under the regulations therein prescribed; and said corporation avers and submits that said ordinance, as amended, fully and completely covers and embraces all reasonable and necessary rules and regulations for the conducting of such business' on the streets of said city, safely and in the interest of the welfare of said city, and its inhabitants, and that said ordinances, as amended, covers and em - braces substantially all the rules and regulations which this Commission could lawfully make, if it possessed the' power at all (which is denied) </seg>
            <seg id="p097">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION to provide methods, rules and regulations for conducting such business on the streets of said city. Protestant further alleges that there Is pending before the city council of Qmaha, a new proposed ordinance, governing regulation of taxicabs, that the only interest of the intervenor, Omaha &amp; Council Bluffs Street Railway' Company, consists of its claimed right to have this Commission prevent entirely the conducting and operation of the said business of the said Publix Cars, for the reason' that such business would establish a competitor for the business of said intervenor, and thus reduce the patronage of said intervenor and interfere with the earnings and income of said intervenor; further averring that under the statutory law of this state, as well as in the existing franchise of said intervenor, voted by the people of said city, it was expressly stated that nothing contained In such law or franchise should deprive the governing body of the city of the right and power to grant licenses and permits- to other auto or motor busses, taxicabs or vehicles, to the use of the streets of the city in carrying passengers for hire. Protestant, further answering, denied each and every allegation con - tained in the application and supplements thereto, not thereinbefore expressly admitted to be true. EVIDENCE Plaintiffs and intervenors introduced a number of witnesses who substantially proved all of the material facts alleged in their applica - tion. Witness Shannahan, on behalf of the Omaha &amp; Council Bluffs Street Railway Company, testified as to the valuation of the street car system, of $14,100,000, which company, at the present time, has adequate facilities for handling the mass transportation of Omaha; that they can carry double the number they are now carrying; that mass tranportation Is essential to Omaha; that if the tram company would cease to function over night, that motor taxicabs could not handle the necessary traffic owing to congestion on the streets; that the tram company failed in 1931 to meet its fixed charges, and that a loss of $350,000 more in a year would mean definite receivership of the com - pany, and result In chaos to the city of Omaha. This witness also testified- as to his observations and knowledge of the proposed plan of Publix Cars in taxicab operations, and that in his opinion, on the placing upon the- streets of Omaha of 175 taxicabs In the service of Publix Cars, the resulting loss in revenue to the tram company would surely wreck such company; that if the Publix Car System increased its number of cars, and employed more men, the tram company would necessarily have to discharge its employes,- on account of loss of patron - age and revenue. Witness Houser,. for the Yellow Cab Company testified that his company had a value of about $350,000; that at the present time he had </seg>
            <seg id="p098">TWENTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT two hundred employes, and was actively operating 78 cabs, with a number of cabs held in reserve, although several years ago he had operated more than a hundred cabs; that there were at present about 150 cabs in Omaha, and that such number was adequate to meet the - demands of the public. This witness also testified that a taxicab would average from 75 to 100 miles per day; that about 50% gross mileage Is earnings; that under a 10c primary rate, a cab would have gross earnings of from $5.00 to $7.00 per day; that the average gross cost of operation of a "Yellow" cab is about 14c per mile, of which about 5c is labor cost of the driver, leaving about 9c pet mile as average cost, exclusive of driver; that average cost of gasoline, oil and grease is .011, and of depreciation is .0199; that the average pay to drivers is about $17.00 to $18.00 per week, plus their tips. Witness Carpenter testified he had been a taxicab operator in Omaha for eleven years, and at the present time Is operating ten Ford cabs; that he was operating in Omaha at a time when competitors started a zone system of fares, and that his business fell off about 40%; that the competitor company which instituted the zone system at that time, went out of business thru bankruptcy. This witness testified that he used Ford cabs with an initial unit investment of $800.00, and that his total overhead per. mile was approxi - mately 12%c per mile; that his average daily run Is about a hundred miles per car, of which 50% is efficient mileage;' that at the present time there is practically no cruising by any of the regular cab drivers; that in his opinion the city Is amply cabbed at present; that if the new system of zone taxicab service is allowed to operate unregulated, that he will soon have twenty-eight employees walking the streets looking for employment; that he has operated under both the zone system and the meter system, and at the present time is using meters, and that the meter system Is the only fair and reasonable method for the public, in that the rider is never confused, there is no chance for fraud, and the patron pays only for the distance traveled, regardless of location in city or direction traveled; that meters cost from $100.00 up to $165.00, with an annual maintenance of from $10.00 to $20.00. Several other witnesses testified for plaintiff, including an official of the National Association ot Taxicab Owners, and an official of a taximeter company. The gist of their testimony was that the meter system of fares was in vogue in practically all cities, and was the fairer system to the public than the zone system; that in practically every case of operation of zone fare systems, -the ultimate result of operations, ranging from a few months to several years, has been failure and bankruptcy of the companies instituting such systems; that in no cases did the zone system operator create any new business, but on the contrary, thru lower prices on short hauls, took the existing business of the other transportation companies; that during the trial </seg>
            <seg id="p099">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION period of operation of the zone system company, the other taxicab com - panies, and the tram company, will go broke; that in Rockport, Indiana, and in Detroit, Michigan, the primary rate was too low, as is proposed here In Omaha, and In Detroit, when the tram company went broke, the city had to take it over and run it, because the receivers were not able to, and the city had to keep up the deficit to keep the street cars running. Another witness testified that in Oklahoma City where this zone system was started, that the regular taxicab companies had a loss of business of about 25%, and the tram company a daily loss of $500, due to the installation of about fifty cars, and resulting rate wars in effect. His personal observation showed considerable cruising along tram lines, and a large percentage in turnover of drivers. He also testified that his average cost per mile of operation, of forty cabs, was about 14c, with his drivers averaging about 5c per mile commission, which netted them from $10.00 to $18.00 per week, plus tips. This witness also was of the opinion that metered service was the only fair and reason - able method of charges to the public. Witness Hubbell, an official of the Publix Cars, offered the principal testimony for protestants. This testimony reveals that the paid In capital of the company is $4,000.00; that they intend to operate a central ' office with telephone connected stations at various points; that the company will furnish the painting for the tops of cars, a cap, a badge, the insurance, a central garage where cars will be inspected; that they intend to provide gasoline, greasing and general garage facil - ities for their operators, and provide the advertising, in consideration of which the operator will pay an initial joining fee of $25.00, and there - after a daily fee or charge of $3.00 per day. The operator can then retain all moneys received, but must operate on the scale of prices fixed by the company. The present plan of zones shows a 10c central zone, with different zones radiating out to 75c zones in the outskirts of Omaha, with a maximum charge of $1.25 for cross-town service. This company started operations on April 26th, 1932, and is now operating with ten cars. The operations for 5% days showed a total of 2223 calls, with gross revenue of $552.67. The witness estimated a mileage of 150 miles per car per day, making 8250 miles of operation, which would give a figure of about 7c per mile In gross revenue. In the event the driver paid the company $3.00 per day, the resulting revenue to the drivers would be $552.67, less ten cars times $3.00 per day times 5% days or a balance of $3.87.67, which leaves each driver $38.76 for 5% days work, or $7.05 per day gross revenue for 150 miles, or about 4.7c per mile. Witness however estimated that as the plan became advertised and used more, that the net revenue would be greater. Witness on cross-examination stated that they would contract with owners of the smaller cars in good condition, and that they could oper- </seg>
            <seg id="p100">TWENTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT ate much cheaper than the usual cars used in taxi business, stating that in his opinion, the total cost of operation should not be over 5c per mile. Witness further testified that they paid for the liability insurance on the cars, but that the liability to any patron in excess of amount carried In the insurance policy, would be limited to the assets of the company. In regard to compliance with the existing regulations, his company had attempted to comply with the city ordinances of Omaha, and introduced in evidence a receipt of payment of an occupation tax.. The issues presented appear to be as follows: 1. Has this Commission full and complete control over the operation of taxicabs as common carriers? 2. Has this Commission authority to establish minimum and maximum fares? 3. Has this Commission authority to order establishment of metered service in lieu of zone fares, and if so. Is such regulation necessary and /or reasonable? 4. Has this Commission authority to require certificates of convenience and necessity, and if so, is such regulation necessary and /or reason - able? PROPOSITIONS OF LAW 1. The jurisdiction ot this Commission over common carriers has been defined in numerous cases by the Nebraska Supreme Court. This Commission derives whatever authority it might have from the constitu - tion of Nebraska, which provides in section 20, article IV, the following: "The powers and duties of such Commission shall include the regulation of rates, service and general control over common car - riers as the legislature may provide by law. But, in the absence of specific legislation the Commission shall exercise the powers and perform the duties enumerated in this provision." - and from specific legislative acts which have been duly passed since the creation of such constitutional provision. House Roll 306 (Laws of 1929, Chapter 147), was enacted by the legislature of 1929, and duly approved by the executive on April 6, 1929. This legislative enactment expressed the will of the people as to cer - tain matters which they commanded this Commission to do. In pur - suance to and in obedience with such legislative command, this Com - mission issued certain orders pertaining to the use, operation and con - trol of taxicabs. It must be conceded that the legislature in no way interfered with, nor did it curtail, any of the jurisdiction of this Com - mission over taxicabs as common carriers. ' The constitutionality of this </seg>
            <seg id="p101">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION act was attacked and our Supreme Court has. In its opinion in that case, clearly defined the status of a taxicab, and alBO has defined the jurisdiction of this Commission. This opinion, cited as Peterson vs. Beal, 121 Nebr. 348 (24 Neb. St. Ry. Com. An. Rep. 206), is in part as follows: "The enforcement of House Roll 306 and Resolution 110 ot the State Railway Commission, as contemplated by the decree ap - pealed from, clearly assumes compliance with their provisions as a prerequisite to engaging in the business of 'common carriers of passengers,' and such being the case, under the authorities re - ferred to, it does in no manner contravene the provisions of sec - tion 3, art. 1 of the Nebraska Constitution or Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. "As to the asserted fact that the requirements thus prescribed are so burdensome as to amount to a confiscation and therefore result in depriving appellant of his property without due process of law, the answer may be made by the following excerpt from the opinion of Sutherland, J., delivered in Packard v. Banton, 264 U. S. 140; 'The fact that, because of circumstances peculiar to him, appellant may be unable to comply with the requirements as to security without assuming a burden greater than that generally borne, or excessive in itself, does not militate against the con - stitutionality of the statute. Moreover, a distinction must be observed between the regulation of an activity which may be en - gaged in as a matter of right, and one carried on by government sufferance or permission. In the latter case the power to exclude altogether generally Includes the lesser power to condition, and may justify a degree of regulation not admissible in the former, See Davis v. Massachusetts, 167 U. S. 43.' "Nor do we find that in the adoption of resolution 110 the Nebraska State Railway Commission exceeded the powers possessed by it. The constitutional provision controlling, adopted in 1906 as a separate and independent amendment to the constitution, created a State Railway Commission, and further provides: 'The powers and duties of such Commission shall include the regulation of rates, service and general control of common carriers as the legis - lature may provide by law. But, In the absence ot specific legisla - tion, the Commission shall exercise the powers and perform the duties enumerated in this provision." Const, art. 4, sec. 20. "This court is committed to the view that, *In adopting the constitutional provision creating the State Railway Commission, it was -made an independent part of the constitution, and not as an amendment to the executive, legislative or judicial articles there - of.' In re Lincoln Traction Co., 103 Neb. 229. The general view of the constitutional provisions in question is well stated by Sedgwick, J., In the same case In the following language: 'Unless there has been specific legislation that might limit or affect this power given to the Commission, it would seem that the people have given this Commission all the control over common carriers that they themselves . could exercise. While this power must be exercised in harmony with the provisions of the federal constitu - tion, and the general provisions of our own constitution that affect all branches of the government, it is plainly not limited by the </seg>
            <seg id="p102">TWENTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT special provisions of the constitution which distinguish between the legislative and judicial departments' ot the government. The functions of this Commission are largely administrative, but, as is stated in Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line Co., supra (211 U. S. 210) the Commission necessarily has independent legislative, judicial, and executive or administrative powers. "Therefore, in the light of the constitutional provisions quoted and referred to, as well as the express terms of House Roll 306, we are of the opinion that resolution 110 was within the power of the Commission to lawfully adopt and enforce. " 'The general rule upon the subject Is that where there is a conflict between an act of the legislature and the constitution of the state, the statute must yield to the extent of the repugnancy, but no further, (Citing cases). If, after striking out the uncon - stitutional part of a statute, the residue is intelligible, complete, and capable of execution, it will be upheld and enforced, except, of course, in cases where it Is apparent that the rejected part was an inducement to the adoption of the remainder. In other words, the legislative will is, within constitutional limits, the law of the land, and when expressed in accordance with established procedure, must be ascertained by courts and made effective.' Scott v. Flowers, 61 Neb. 620, 623. "Eliminating all portions of the act solely relating to 'drlve- It-yourself cars, the remainder still is intelligible, complete and capable of execution. It therefore must be upheld and enforced. As we see no reason which would justify our accepting the view that the portion solely applicable to 'drlve-lt-yourself cars was an Inducement to the adoption of the residue, the remainder fully and completely covers the subject of 'common carriers' as applied to the use of motor vehicles. It therefore must be held to be a valid enactment and in full force. State v. Stunt, 52 Neb. 209; Logan County v. Carnahan. 66 Neb. 693." It must be concluded that taxicabs are common carriers, and as such, "the powers and duties of this Commission shall include the regu - lation of rates, service and general control". The only exceptions as to such general control, are the specific provisions as set out In said House Roll 306, and in the Osterman Act as to the minimum fares, which will be discussed later in this order. It is conceded, however, that whatever regulation and /or control is exercised by this Commis - sion, will not relieve any such common carrier taxicabs from any further regulation which might be Imposed upon It by any municipality in which it operates, through Its lawful municipal police powers. The courts have, in numerous other cases, defined a like jurisdic - tion of this Commission, and other courts have generally laid down the same principles. In Terminal Taxicab Company vs. District of Columbia Commission, 241 U. S. 251, the court said: "a.- A taxicab is a common carrier", and "b. that the jurisdiction cannot be defeated because it had not previously exercised such jurisdiction." </seg>
            <seg id="p103">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION In a most recent case, dated March 28, 1932, the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, in an opinion which has not as yet been reported, but a copy 'of which is on file in this case, said in a case entitled City Cab Corporation, etc. et al., Bell Cab Company, etc. et al., vs. Mason M. Patrick, etc. et al.. Equity Nos. 53736, 53732, held that taxicabs were common carriers and subject to the jurisdiction of the Public Utilities Commission. This case involved practically the identical issues involved In this proceeding, wherein several taxicab companies appealed to the Utilities Commission of the District of Columbia for regulations of taxicabs as common carriers, alleging at that time that they were confronted with the same class of competition alleged in this proceeding. The same issues and practically the same kind of evidence was presented to the Commission, and the above mentioned decision was rendered by said Supreme Court on appeal to such court from a decision of the Commission. In view of the above decisions and conclusions, we are of the opinion and so find that taxicabs are common carriers. 2. Establishment of minimum and maximum fare. As heretofore stated. It Is our opinion that the Commission is precluded from exercis - ing certain control if and when the legislature enacts specific legisla - tion pertaining to or affecting any of the jurisdiction. In 1923 the legis - lature by the so-called Osterman Act says, In Sec. 75-1001, C. S. Nebr. 1929, as follows: "No public body in this state authorized to fix rates for the service of any public utility shall establish other than maximum rates, and any minimum rate established -by said body shall be deemed null and void." This law, in our opinion, precludes any order of the Commission fixing a minimum rate. In regard to maximum rates, the evidence in this case does not warrant any conclusions of the Commission at this time as to maximum rates. The composite opinion of the witnesses in this case seems to be that a maximum rate order Is not necessary, because, as one witness stated, "competition makes rates — not cost of service." 3. Has this Commission authority to order establishment of metered service in lieu of zone fares, and if so, is such regulation necessary and / or reasonable? Taximeters for use upon vehicles have long been known. With the advent of the motor cab, the practice became usual to fix the charge by meter, except where the vehicle was hired on an hourly basis. The practice was so common that the ordinary name of a cab is now taxicab. It seems to have been generally conceded that it was reasonable to require a meter to be used on a taxicab, and to require the charge to be based on that meter, except where the vehicle was operating solely on an hourly basis and the power of the public author - ities to require the taximeter is universally upheld. </seg>
            <seg id="p104">TWENTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT See: Yellow Taxicab Co. v. Caynor, 143 N. Y. Supp. 279. Yellow Taxicab Co. v. Caynor, 144 N. Y. Supp 200 Ex Parte Tarllng,.241 S. W. 929 (Missouri). Kentucky Cab Co. v. Louisville, 230 Ky. 218, 221. Harlan v. Bell, 54 Wash. Law. Rep. 831, 57 App. D. C. 255. Re Meter Rates for Taxicab Service, P. U. R. 1931 B 258 (Conn.) Re Meter Rates for Taxicab Service, P. U. R. 1931 C 406 (Conn.) City Cab Corporation, et al. v. Mason M. Patrick, — App. D. C. — . We must conclude that the requirement that meters shall be used has been shown by experience to be essential in order to check the frauds which might easily be perpetrated upon passengers. The require - ment that, meters shall be used Is not only necessary, but is obviously . so just and reasonable a regulation as not to justify further discussion. Several of the cases cited above further find that a requirement of this nature is not discriminatory, because meters are not required on street cars and busses, or cars operating on an hourly basis, In which finding we must concur. The Commission is of the opinion and so finds that the only system of charges commensurate with the service rendered, and fair to all parties, is one based upon the length of the ride, and that the taximeter system is the only one which fulfills these conditions. 4. Has this Commission authority to require certificates of con - venience and necessity, and if so, is such regulation necessary and /or reasonable? It is to be remembered that the framers of our present constitution, and the people who overwhelmingly voted for the amend - ment In 1906, decided to abandon the then beaten path of precedents in regulation, and to handle the modern problems and conditions by advanced and up-to-date methods and procedure. The supervision and control of common carriers has ever been, and probably always will be, one of the most vexatious as well as vital questions of government. All persons agree that the capital Invested in public service should receive reasonable remuneration, and that the service rendered should be efficient and practicable, and to all patrons upon equal terms and conditions. With a full knowledge that these things had not been ac - complished under the laws theretofore existing in this and other juris - dictions, the people, in their fundamental law, created this Commission, and clothed it with full power to investigate, hear, and determine dis - putes and controversies between common carriers and the general pub - lic. This was done primarily for the interest of the public. If any party is dissatisfied with the rates, service or control of such carrier, he may file his complaint with the Commission and secure an investiga - tion and determination of the wrong charged. Subject to the specific legislation above cited, the "power and duty of such Commission shall include the regulation of rates, service and </seg>
            <seg id="p105">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION general control of common carriers". The constitution of the United States grants to Congress power to regulate commerce between the states. Regarding this power of regulation, the Supreme Court of the United States, speaking through Mr. Chief Justice Taft, in the case of Dayton-Goose Creek R. Co. vs. United States, 263 U. S. 456; 44 S. Ct, 169, 172; 68 L. Ed. 388; 33 A. L. R. 472, says: 'To regulate in the sense intended is to foster, protect and control the commerce with appropriate regard to the welfare of those who are immediately concerned, as well as the public at large, and to promote its growth and insure its safety." It might be contended that the power of the Interstate Commerce Commission, to require certificates of convenience and necessity for transportation facilities, is granted by the specific authority of the Trans - portation Act ot 1920, but it is reasonable to assume that a like power rests in this Commission, in the absence of specific legislation denying such power. It is our conclusion that the jurisdiction we have hereto - fore exercised over the rates and service of the local tram company includes a duty to enforce uniformly and impartially such jurisdiction, and that when an emergency arises threatening the very existence of the present common carrier transportation Companies, we should require such conditions for operation which shall insure the continued mass transportation system of the city. The public is vitally interested in the development of a safe, adequate and sufficient transportation, and a continuance of unregulated competition capable only of furnishing in - ferior service will eventually result In the wrecking of the transporta - tion companies of the city, a condition which ought not come to pass. The evidence in this case shows that the present ordinances of the City of Omaha do not restrict in any way the number of taxicabs, nor do they prescribe the proper regulation of such taxicabs. We are of the opinion and so find that the circumstances and conditions existing and threatened, require that all taxicab transportation companies in Omaha, Nebraska, be required to apply for and receive a certificate of convenience and necessity from this Commission. "Public convenience and necessity require the combined use of. all agencies which can contribute to adequate and efficient transportation at the lowest cost. (Pittsburgh L. &amp; W. R. Co., Construction, 150 I. C. C. 43.)" A question might be raised as to discrimination between Omaha and other municipalities in the state, but, we are of the opinion that a regulation applying only to one city does not deny equal protection of laws, where based on a real distinction between that particular city and other territories in the state. The state, and its municipal corporations under their delegated pow - ers, may regulate the use of streets and highways where no merely arbitrary discriminations are "made. The density and continuity of traf- </seg>
            <seg id="p106">TWENTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT flc upon the streets of large cities justify measures to safeguard the public from the peculiar and additional dangers which arise out of the operation of motor vehicles in such cities. Streets, are primarily devoted to use by the public in the ordinary way. The statute may determine that such use of streets shall be preferred over their use by carriers for hire. The operation of vehicles in streets for purposes of gain is extraordinary and generally may be prohibited or may be permitted upon such conditions as the legislature or a regulatory com - mission may prescribe. Taxicabs are operated for gain, and hence are in service during longer periods of the day and night over all streets, and usually at higher rates of speed than motor vehicles devoted solely to private pursuits, whether of business or pleasure. Motor trucks are operated principally in daylight over fewer streets, and at lower speeds, than taxicabs. The presence of taxicabs in the congested streets of large cities Increases the probability of accidents and consequently of personal injuries. The. question of classification is primarily legislation and only becomes judicial when the legislative action is clearly unreason - able. Statutes similar in character have been enacted in a number of states, and, except in certain instances as to particular provisions found to be arbitrary or unreasonable, have been sustained as a proper exer - cise of police power. See: Weksler vs. Collins, et al., 147 N. E. 797, (Chicago, 111.) This Commission has exercised complete and continued jurisdiction over rates and service of the Omaha &amp; Council Bluffs Street Railway Company, and is requiring it to furnish transportation throughout the city for a 10c cash fare, or a token fare of 8%c. This Commission is well aware of the fact that long distance hauling by the tram company is done at a loss, and the only profitable business enjoyed by such com - pany, is the down-town short haul business. The Commission now feels, under present circumstances, that its primary obligation to the people of Omaha is to do everything in its power to see that all of the people of Omaha have available, low cost transportation. This, obvi - ously, would not be possible if the tram' company's down-town or short haul business, which is its only profitable business, is taken away, or even partially taken away. A division of the short haul business will eventually mean either less frequent street car service to the outlying districts, or higher fares, or both. The city of Omaha, in the opinion of this Commission, Is now adequately supplied with mass transportation. This low cost transporta - tion is now being furnished by this tram company. Motor transportation for hire is furnished by numerous taxicab companies, against the service ot which there has never been any complaint filed with this Commission, and which this Commission at present has reason to believe is adequate, for the reason that these present taxicab companies are now operating fewer cabs than they did a few years ago* and the number of tram car riders is monthly growing less. </seg>
            <seg id="p107">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION The legislature, in anticipation of a situation such is now before us very wisely. In Section 75-602 of the Complied Statutes of Nebraska for 1929, provided that: "Nothing in the foregoing section shall be construed to pre - vent the Commission from having the power, when deemed by it necessary, to prevent interstate rate wars and injury to the business of the citizens of the state, railway companies or com - mon carriers, or in case of any other emergency to be judged by the Commission, and it shall be the duty ot the Commission to temporarily alter, amend or suspend any existing freight rates tariffs, schedules, orders and circular of any railway company or common carrier • • •."

RESOLUTIONS. RESOLUTION NO. 81 In the Matter of the Class Rates Applicable between All Stations in Nebraska. APPLICATION NO. 6146 In the Matter of the Application of All Nebraska Lines for Authority to Publish Increased Class Rates. OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: Pursuant to notice previously given, this matter came on for final hearing before the entire Commission at Lincoln, Nebraska. </seg>
            <seg id="p151">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION Under date of January 8, 1926, the Nebraska lines, filed an applica - tion with this Commission, known as Application No. 6146, seeking a complete revision of the class rate structure. The prayer of the ap - plicant was as follows: "WHEREFORE, your petitioners respectfully request that the Commission In exercise of the power vested In It after duly Investi - gating the matters herein alleged, issue the necessary order or orders accomplishing the complete revision of the class rate struc - ture in said territory, to the end that the revenues of said carriers may be increased to more nearly yield a fair return." Under date of June 11, 1926, after complaints had been filed by various interested parties, the Commission entered its Resolution No. 81, reciting the facts that there existed at that time a prejudicial, prefer - ential and discriminatory class rate structure within the state; that this preferential or discriminatory rate situation had been caused by an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission in a decision known as the Missouri River-Nebraska cases, 40 I. C. C. 201; that for a period or years, this Commission had been restrained from investigating the class rate situation In Nebraska by an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission in Docket 11829, or by order of the Director General during the period of federal control; that the discrimination that existed was due to a dual system of class rates in Nebraska, rates from and to some points being materially higher than rates to and from other points within the state; that in view of this situation, the Commission was of the opinion that an investigation of all intrastate class rates should be made for the purpose of determining a schedule of lawful class rates to apply alike between Nebraska stations. A copy of this resolution was served upon all Nebraska carriers. On January 12, 1927, the Commislson entered an order In connection with Application No. 6146, consolidating the application with Resolution No, 81. Previous to the entering of this order, however, a hearing was held before the Nebraska Commission under dates of June 28th and 30th, 1926, for the purpose of determining what procedure should be followed relative to the resolution of the Commission and the application of the carriers. Commissioner Browne characterized the investigation, at that time, as a sort of "fishing expedition for information." At a later point, facts will be developed relative to some of the testimony offered during this hearing. On January 25, 1927, the first joint hearing of the Interstate Com - merce Commission and the Nebraska Commission took place at Omaha, Nebraska. The Interstate Commerce Commission was represented by Commissioner Frank McManamy and Examiners Kobel and Paulson. The Nebraska Commission was represented by H. G. Taylor, Chairman and </seg>
            <seg id="p152">TWENTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT J. H. Miller, Commissioner. At that time Commissioner McManamy outlined the issues as follows : "Commissioner McManamy: The Interstate Commerce Com - mission has assigned for hearings here and now No. 17000, Rate Structure Investigation, Part 2, Western Trunk Line Class Rates." * * * "In addition, the State Railway Commission of Nebraska has assigned for hearing its Resolution No. 81, in the matter of Class Rates applicable between all stations in Nebraska." (p. 29) • * * "H. G. Taylor, Chairman and Commissioner J. H. Miller are sitting with us for the Nebraska Commission (p. 30) except as to the case pending before the Nebraska Commission and which is as - signed for hearing jointly with the proceedings assigned by the Interstate Commerce Commission, this is a hearing before the Interstate Commerce Commission only. It is not a hearing before any state Commission, except Nebraska." Under date of May 21, 1927, a second hearing was held at Omaha, with Chairman Taylor sitting on behalf of the Nebraska Commission. This hearing was adjourned to Lincoln on May 23, 1927, with Chairman Taylor, Commissioners Randall and Miller present. Examiner Kobel representing the Interstate Commerce Commission, in his opening state - ment had the following to say: "This will also be a joint hearing with the Nebraska Com - mission their proceeding being Resolution No. 81 of the State Railway Commission of Nebraska." (R. 5093) Chairman Taylor inquired of parties present whether or not it would be agreeable to stipulate that the portions of the record applicable to Nebraska made at that particular hearing might be considered a part of the record in the Nebraska case, to which all parties agreed. The In - terstate Commerce Commission, in connection with these proceedings, did not submit its final decision in the interstate case until May 6, 1930. After the Interstate Commerce Commission's decision was entered, the Nebraska Commission deemed it necessary that further evidence be taken with regard to the Nebraska situation and assigned these cases for further hearing at Lincoln on February 16, 1931, at which time the record In this case, after all parties had completed their testimony, was submitted, with a stipulation that both carriers and shippers be given thirty days after the completion of the transcript to file briefs, if they so desired. Briefs were filed by both shippers and carriers. We believe that a brief review of the class rate structure in Nebraska is necessary In order to follow the adjustment down to the present tiirie. In August, 1914, the Nebraska State Railway Commission, pursuant to instructions of the legislature, entered its findings and order in what is known as General Order No. 19, promulgating maximum class rates for application within the state, the rates to be established on or before September 6, 1914. These- rates continued in effect until October 25, </seg>
            <seg id="p153">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 1916, when the carriers, under a decision of the Interstate Commerce Commission, established the so-called Clark scale between thirteen job - bing points in Nebraska, viz: Omaha, Lincoln, Beatrice, Fairbury, Platts - mouth, St. Paul, Grand Island, Nebraska City, Norfolk, Columbus and Kearney, and other stations within the state. The decision is known as the Missouri River-Nebraska cases, 40 I. C. C. 201. in this case the Interstate Commerce Commission, found that a prejudicial situation ex - isted and ordered correction by the establishment of the scale of rea - sonable maximum rates prescribed in the decision. This scale is known as the Clark scale and hereafter will be referred to as the Clark scale. The Interstate Commerce Commission, however, did not disturb the G. O. 19 rates applying on traffic to and from other points within Ne - braska. This had the effect of making two scales of class rates ef - fective upon intrastate traffic. These two scales have since that time been subject to the general increases and reductions ordered by the dirctor general under his General Order No. 28, effective June 25, 1918, the order of the Interstate Commerce Commission in Docket 11829, the order of the Nebraska Commission in Application No. 4299, as amended, and the reduced rates of 1922. The Clark scale, as prescribed, was made subject to the Western Classification. On March 24, and May 14, 1925, the Nebraska Commission entered its order in Application No. 4934, providing for the application of the Western Classification on all traffic In Nebraska. This order was predi - cated upon an agreement between representatives of the carriers, ship - pers and the Nebraska' Commission to the effect that certain exceptions to the classification would be continued in effect on intrastate traffic; that where necessary additional exceptions would be established to take care of peculiar situations existing in Nebraska. Summing the matter up, we find that the Western Classification is now in effect on all Ne - braska traffic; that the few exceptions to the classification have been and are now in effect on Nebraska traffic; that the G. O. 19 rates found reasonable by this Commission in 1914 have been to some extent super - seded by the Clark scale; that both of these scales have been modified in conformity with general Increases and reductions with the result that the present rates are now on a materially higher basis than they were when first found reasonable by either this Commission or the Interstate Commerce Commission. At hearings held June 20th to 30th, inclusive, 1926, in connection with Resolution No. 81, the carriers were requested by the Commission to take the lead in the presentation of testimony and we reproduce here some of the testimony offered by them in that hearing, which we feel is germane 'to the issues here involved. Mr. F.. Montmorency, on behalf of the Nebraska lines made the following statement: </seg>
            <seg id="p154">TWENTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT "As an expression of the carriers' desire In this situation, I would say that the logical solution should be to apply what is known as the Clark scale generally throughout Nebraska." Mr. A. F. Cleveland, Vice President of the C. &amp; N. W. Ry. Co. in charge of rates and divisions, was called to the stand and offered the following testimony: "In so far as the territory west of the Missouri river was concerned that Nebraska would be particularly interested in, the proposal was 110% of the existing Clark scale. And this petition in paragraph 3 relates to a basis of 110% of the Clark scale for application west of the Missouri river in Nebraska and Kansas, state and interstate." Q. (By Little) "In discussing your application- for 110% of the Clark scale in Nebraska, was it the carriers' purpose to limit the application of that scale to the jobbing points as at present, or do they seek its uniform application between all points?" A. (Cleveland) "They seek Its uniform application, state and Interstate, between all points." • » • » * "Speaking only for myself, there is no question in my mind but what the present Nebraska situation is highly discriminatory, and if it is decided prior to the termination of the case which I know by the name of Ex Parte 87, Sub. 1, it seems to me that the logical and proper way to place Nebraska on a single .rate level, would he to substitute for the Order 19 rates, the so-called Missouri-River-Nebraska Cities scale, which now applies from the so-called jobbing points." • • • • • "It is also a fact that from some stations in Nebraska, the distance tariff rates charged from those stations are on a materially higher basis than from other stations in Nebraska, and that, to my mind, constitutes a discrimination." Q. (By Little) "Was it not, however, the effect of your proposal to bring the class rates east of the Missouri river and up to the Missouri river, closer to the class rates applicable west of the Missouri river, wiping out the very great difference In the level, to a considerable extent?" A. (Cleveland) "That was our purpose, yes." Q. (Powell) "Did the carriers propose to show the Nebraska Commission in this proceeding the reason why the Clark scale should be applied on the state as a whole?" A. (Cleveland) "I have no doubt but what our company would be glad to introduce evidence before you in support of that proposal. * • • Now, if the Clark scale is a reasonable scale for application for Omaha • * • and St. Joseph, obviously It must be a reasonable scale for application from these smaller Interior towns." Q. (Powell) "The Clark scale was found reasonable at what time?" </seg>
            <seg id="p155">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION A. (Cleveland) "I would say about 1916 but the Clark scale has not been changed except in connection with the general ad - vances and reductions since that time." Q. (Powell) "And it will be the position of the carriers now at this time that the record made in 1916 would apply on Ne - braska traffic at this time?" A. (Cleveland) Yes, we could prove that very easily to your .satisfaction, I. think." • • *- "If you want a single rate level, the thing to do is to take that that has heretofore been approved, bearing in mind that the rates applying from these other points, so-called Order 19 rates, are too low." (Commissioner Browne) "We have Mr. Cleveland who thinks that temporarily we ought to continue straight distance scale for Nebraska from all points. We also suggested that the Clark scale was the level that he thinks ought to be continued." Q. (Browne) "If you put in straight distance tariff, that will apply to every city or village in the state?" A. (Cleveland) "On preferential basis, yes." * * • "If you are going to make rates for the entire state, and not divide your state into several different rate zones, it necessarily follows that the Nebraska level must be higher than the Iowa level." • • • "My Idea Is that if the Clark scale is put In Nebraska, that - the short line should determine the rate base and that the long line should be permitted within reason to meet the short line rate, and have relief from the operation of the long and short haul clause at intermediate points." * * * "The reasonableness of the Clark scale has already been de - termined for this- territory, and from the majority of the shipping points in the state. Now, you know and I know that from the non-jobbing points, there is a lower basis of rates In effect If there is to be a standard basis, it seems to me that the most logical basis to adopt is that basis now In effect from the jobbing points, which were established, not by the carriers, but by the Interstate Commerce Commission after hearing." Q. (Childe) "Now so far as the permanent adjustment is concerned, is it your position or the position of the Nebraska lines, that one uniform distance tariff should apply throughout the state?" A. (Cleveland) "Yes." Q. (Childe) "With no higher level on the North Western, for example than on the Union Pacific or Burlington?" A. (Cleveland) "That is correct." Q. (Hartman) "Is it your opinion that the same- level of rateB, if the mileage scale is adopted, should apply In western part of the state as in the eastern part?" </seg>
            <seg id="p156">TWENTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT A. (Cleveland) "My idea is that there will be much less friction and trouble, if a single rate scale is applied throughout the state. If that is to be the theory of the adjustment, then the average condition, taking the state as a whole, must be taken into consideration rather than the more favorable conditions in the one part" At subsequent hearings, in which the Nebraska Commission sat with the Interstate Commerce Commission, the ' carriers submitted certain proposals relative to the class rate adjustment throughout Western Trunk Line territory, with the proposal that their so-called scale 3 should apply in the territory west of the Missouri River. In other words, in so far as Nebraska was concerned, the carriers proposal was to estab - lish a single scale of rates for application throughout the state, which scale was somewhat higher than .that proposed for states east of the Missouri River. Carriers introduced evidence designed to show operat - ing conditions on the main and branch lines within the state. This evidence showed that the cost of branch line operation was greater than the main line operation; that the gross and net tons handled were greater on the main than on the branch line; that the locomotives in service were capable of handling a greater amount of tonnage than was being handled. Considerable testimony was Introduced relative to the train loadings and average loadings of merchandise cars. It was also shown that interstate and intrastate traffic moved in the same trains. Numerous studies were Introduced relative to the rates pre - scribed by the Interstate Commerce Commission for application in vari - ous territories. It was the carriers position, generally, that there should be but one scale of rates throughout Nebraska; that the continuance of the G. O. 19 rates and the Clark 'scale rates would act to continue discriminatory situations. It was the position of the witness for the Nebraska Commission that one scale of rates should apply throughout the state. The matter then resolves itself into what should be the proper level of rates, carriers and shippers having agreed that one scale should be applicable throughout the territory. In the joint hearings, considerable testimony was introduced by the late Mr. U. G. Powell, at that time rate expert for the Nebraska State Railway Commission, dealing with cost studies, upon which the witness formulated what he considered was a properly graded scale for the movement of class traffic. We recognize the fact that cost studies are Important but do not believe that there is a sufficient amount of evi - dence in the record to enable us to promulgate a scale on the cost theory. However, there is considerable merit in their contentions. We have given careful and serious consideration to these factors but we are inclined to agree with the Interstate Commerce Commission in its disposal of the cost question as indicated by it in its decision in the class rate investigation. Docket 17000, Part II, 64 I. C. C. 1, pages 186 to 189 inclusive. There are so many cost factors that cannot be given </seg>
            <seg id="p157">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION proper weight until the carriers themselves have segregated their oper - ating expenses and are able to determine the cost of handling certain classes of traffic. A number of exhibits were introduced dealing with the revenues, expenses, rate of return on freight and passenger business for the tei« - rltory as a whole and for the state of Nebraska. These figures will be dealt with In more detail in later pages of this report. After all of this testimony has been submitted, the Interstate Com - merce Commission entered its decision, shown as Exhibit No. 1, In the last hearing before this Commission, prescribing for interstate applica - tion, a scale of class rates tor one part of Nebraska which is materially higher than for another part. In other words,, zone 2 scale was pre - scribed for application In the eastern part of the state and zone 3, a higher scale, for application In the western part of the state. The carriers rely upon this decision as their evidence in support of these scales for application within the state regardless of the fact that they themselves in previous hearings had contended for one scale of rates throughout the state. Exhibit 1, just referred to carries the prescribed percentage rela - tionship between classes, which the carriers desire to put in on Ne - braska traffic. During this hearing the carriers stressed the fact that the new proposed Zone 3 scale was but 107%% greater than zone 2 scale and in support of these two scales indicated that the Commission had made no mistake in dividing the state, altho contrary to their pre - vious proposal; that the conditions in eastern Nebraska are very dif - ferent from those in western Nebraska; that the principal jobbing and manufacturing activities in the state are found in the eastern portion; that Nebraska was not singled out by the Interstate Commerce Com - mission for unusual treatment but that, on the contrary, several of the states were divided up in like manner. Considerable evidence was in - troduced relative to the population of the state. Another exhibit was introduced showing the land area in one portion, compared with the land area in another. These figures were compared with the figures for the states to the north and south of Nebraska. No figures were sub - mitted dealing with the states east and west of Nebraska. In short, carriers presented their additional testimony in response to a question - naire sent out by the rate department of the Commission. The ques - tionnaire contained the following: (1) Should the state' of Nebraska be divided up into two zones? Carriers position was that it should be. . (2) Should there be one scale of class rates for the entire state, whether it be from jobbing or non-jobbing points. Carriers position was that there should be two scales, one for the eastern and one for the western part of the state. </seg>
            <seg id="p158">TWENTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT (3) What should be a proper level of class rates for Nebraska as a whole and for each zone. Carriers contended that the order of the Interstate Commerce Commission should apply. (4) Should the same percentage relationship between classes be laid down? Carriers position was that the same percentages applied to 23 classes by the Interstate Commerce Commission should be pre - scribed for Nebraska. (5) Should single line rates be prescribed for application on each rail - road? (6) Should joint line rates be prescribed for application on all lines? Carriers urged that the same kind of single and joint line rates should be established for Nebraska as were prescribed for Interstate application. (7) Should there be a provision providing for a departure from the long and short haul clause? Carriers indicated that In their opinion it was necessary to have this 4th section relief in order that the revenues might not be decreased. (8) Should key points be selected and the rates made on a block system? Carriers response was that It was advisable to have the key point or block system prescribed for application throughout Ne - braska, except that the distance scale should apply for short haul rates up to possibly 50 miles. (9) What method should be used for finding the proper short line dis - tances? Carriers suggested that the method followed by the Interstate Commerce Commission be used in Nebraska, which was that the shortest route via junctions where direct track connections existed should be used. (10) Should the carriers be required to establish 'head line points such as are now carried in the tariffs? Carriers responded that the publication of group rates would not necessitate the establishment of head line points. (11) Should the new class rates act as a maximum on commodities now moving on either a commodity or class rate? It was the position of the carriers that the 23 classes should act as a maximum and that specific commodity rates should be increased or decreased to observe the percentage relationship to the first class; that in their opinion it was unfair to them to have the percentage applied only when the result would be reductions. (12) Another question suggested that the carriers were to put in testi - mony to justify the proposed rates as prescribed by the Interstate </seg>
            <seg id="p159">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION Commerce Commission for application in zones 2 and 3 in Nebraska. To this the carriers replied that in their opinion the record made in the joint hearings justified the establishment of rates in zones for Nebraska. Carriers also submitted additional testimony showing that drastic reductions would be made in their revenues if their rates for the trans - portation of grain and grain products were reduced in conformity with the decision of the Interstate Commerce Commission's decision in Docket 17000, Part 7. (13) Another question was — Does the scale of rates proposed by the carriers penalize the short haul traffic and give long haul traffic undue preference? The reply of the carriers to this was that the rates for short - hauls were not important considering the conditions under which they were to be applied, but that the rates for the long haul were unduly low. Carriers made some studies from the records of this Commission showing Nebraska less carload tonnage handled by the various roads in zones 2 and 3 and disclosing that the less carload tonnage in zone 2 was much greater than that in zone 3 and on account of this tact took the position that this was the dissimilarity of conditions surround - ing the handling of class rate traffic between eastern and western Ne - braska. Witness Hoffelder, recalled by the carriers, stated that he thought it perfectly proper to consider traffic density figures in the making of a basis of rates. He stated that traffic density or volume of traffic was what the carriers were depending upon for their revenue; that in his opinion, rates should be made that were remunerative rather than look - ing at traffic density figures or other factors. He also stated that in Nebraska the main lines operated east and west, whereas in Iowa there was considerably more branch line than main line mileage, hence the traffic moved in all directions. Witness Hoffelder stated that the figures submitted by witness Little, as to the costs on various divisions, was for the purpose of affording a check of the individual performances of each division and not for the purpose of ascertaining the actual costs. In response to a question by Commissioner Drake, Mr. Hoffelder had the following to say relative to the making of intrastate rates In Nebraska — first, he .would consider the revenue needs of the carriers, then he would look around to see what rate levels were in contiguous territory, then analyze the traffic handled by the railroads in any particular state to ascertain the routes of the traffic and then the rate levels under which the major portion of the traffic is conducted and the ability of such a carrier to secure adequate rates on such major movements of traffic, such as grain, live stock and products of agriculture In this territory. He would also give consideration to the trucking problem. </seg>
            <seg id="p160">TWENTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT The major activity in a given locality should also be compared with other localities. He also indicated that it would be necessary to take into account the public Interest in connection with the prescribing of reasonable and non-discriminatory rates. Witness pointed out that less than 5% of their total traffic is less than carload traffic. Mr. C. F. Balch offered rebuttal testimony as to certain cost figures submitted by witness Childe and elaborated upon the Lorenz formula for ascertaining those costs and pointed out that there were a great many discrepancies in the figures, that It was Impossible to secure an accurate separation of such costs, making the statement that Dr. Lorenz' cost studies were conducted merely as a sort of experiment. In rebuttal of exhibits submitted by Witness Ross, Mr. Balch stated that he did not claim the roads In Nebraska were making only 4% but that the figure did not come up to a rate of return shown by Witness Ross, who placed it as 5.77%. He admitted that the figures submitted by Witness Ross were the only figures available but they should be taken with a "little grain of salt." He also testified that the motive power used on the North Western in Nebraska was equipment that had been re - placed in Iowa and that the engines in Nebraska could not haul as many tons as those in Iowa; that as a matter of fact, the equipment in Ne - braska was really second hand motive equipment. On cross-examination. Witness Balch admitted that he did not know whether the rate levels were higher in Nebraska than in Iowa and that with the higher rate levels the revenues In Nebraska might be higher than in Iowa. Referring to witness Hoffelder's statement that zone 3 rate's were but 107% of zone 2, we note that this percentage figure was based upon the totals of the first class rates for the two zones for distances 1 to 500 miles inclusive. As there can never be a 500 mile haul In Nebraska where that haul would be entirely within either zone, it follows that this percentage relationship does not represent the true situation. A more complete picture would be obtained by using the present and proposed rates applied to the actual tonnage moved. The carriers during the course of the hearings In Docket 17000, Part 2, presented traffic test figures for a Bix day movement. These days were selected by the carriers as representative days for movements during certain periods of the year. For instance, the C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. submitted figures for March 15, 16, 17- and September 23, 24, 25, and covered the entire movement of less than carload as well as carload traffic from certain selected Nebraska key points on the one hand and Nebraska stations on the other. We realize that movements and volume will fluctuate but are Inclined to believe that these figures are more reliable than the mere comparison of rates based on any set of scales. Exhibit 8, submitted by Witness Ross, appears to more directly re - flect the situation. He developed the following facts with respect to the </seg>
            <seg id="p161">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION actual movement of less carload traffic. The points selected were tno same key points used by the carriers' witness in I. C. C. Docket 17000, Part 2. On movements originating in zone 2, the key points used were Omaha, Lincoln, Grand Island, Hastings, Beatrice, Fremont, Norfolk, Superior and Plalnview. Carriers' witness showed that the Nebraska less carload revenue, predicated upon the present rates and tonnage moved during the test period, to and from these key points, for . the .6 day period, amounted to $30,716.00. Using the proposed rates, the revenue on the same tonnage would increase to $34,367.00 or 18.8%. On movements from or to the so-called zone 3 territory, the proposed revenue would Increase from $22,415.00 to $24,811.00, or 10.7%. For movements within the so-called zone 3 territory, the carriers used the following key points, Valentine, Crawford, Sidney, Alliance, McCook, Gering and North Platte. The present revenue on less carload traffic to and from points within zone 3 was $1,028.00 and under the proposed rates would be $1,582.00 or a percentage increase of 53.9%. On traffic moving between these key points and points in zone 2 the increase is represented by 11.2%. It is interesting to note that the proposed in - creases from the specific key points to various destinations range as high as 67.7%. Taking the figures shown for the six day test period as representing one week and increasing the figure to represent a year or 52 weeks, it is found that the increased revenue based on the tonnage for that period -would amount to $345,700.00. Breaking this figure up into results for movements within zone 2, we find that the actual increase in dollars would amount to $189,926.00 and the increased revenue for movements within zone 3 would amount to $28,809.00; that the increase in revenue on movements from zone 2 and zone 3 would be $124,606.00 and the increase in revenues from zone 3 to zone 2 would amount to $2,459.00. The total Increase on movements from key points In zone 2 to points in zones 2 and 3 would be $314,432.00 and the Increase from the key points in zone 3 to points in zones 3 and 2 would be $31,268.00. These figures, however, do not cover all the less carload traffic in Ne - braska. Figures submitted by the carriers dealing with the commodity traffic statistics for 69 roads In western district, year 1924, indicate that less carload traffic constitutes about 3% of the total tonnage and yields about 13% of the total freight revenues. Applying 13% to the total freight revenues for 1929, shown by Witness Ross for the Nebraska roads as $83,303,000.00 plus, we find that the less carload revenue for that year approximates $10,829,000. If we add to this figure the in - creases on less carload traffic that would obtain under the proposed rates, based on the traffic test figures extended for the year, we find that it would represent an increase of 3.19% in the less carload revenue and .415% increase in tbe total freight revenues. If we apply this amount of Increase to the net railway operating income for the Nebraska roads for 1929, it results in a figure. Of $22,259,313, a percentage Increase of 1.57% and by the same token, it would increase the annual rate of </seg>
            <seg id="p162">TWENTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT return on the investment figures shown by Witness Ross for this year from 5.77% to 5.86%. We feel that an Increase of $345,700.00 on less carload traffic within the state of Nebraska places an undue burden upon the Nebraska ship - pers. We realize that at the present time there are two scales of rates in effect and that this situation must be corrected. We believe that the increase of $189,926 on traffic In the eastern half of Nebraska, plus what the increase would be in the western part of the state, predicated upon the zone 2 rates, would increase the revenues of the carriers, altho It would increase in a greater percentage the rates in western part of the state. We also recognize the fact that under the carriers proposal the 4th class rate will be reduced from 60% to 55%. Yet, the figures shown In this record indicate that the zone 2 scale would Increase the revenue on 4th class commodities. We also recognize the fact that the use of the short line mileage for figuring the rates will affect, to some extent, the Increases shown herein. The testimony clearly shows that the traffic in Nebraska moves east and west. It would, therefore, seem that Nebraska rates ought not to be on a higher level than rates In states east and west of Nebraska. In order to show that there is an inconsistency in the method of prescribing rates by the Interstate Commerce Commission for territory east and west in Nebraska, we. point out that zone 2 rates have been prescribed for movements originating on the Sargent, branch of the C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. and on the Loup City branch of the U. P. R. R., which lines yield but a small amount of tonnage. These rates are lower than rates prescribed for movements from stations on the main line of the C. B. &amp; Q. cross country but a few miles, where the tonnage is considerably greater and as the record in this case shows, a line yield - ing for the year 1925 — 2,128,220 net ton miles per mile of line. We see no justification for a higher level of rates on the main line of the C. B. &amp; Q. just mentioned than applies on the branch lines. Another peculiar situation is obtained on the line of the North Western, the breaking point beween the two zones being Long Pine, Neb., with no difference in operating conditions east or west of that line except that approximately 95% of the mileage west is main line. The same situa - tion exists with the Union Pacific. The breaking point is Kearney, Neb., and no one will seriously contend that transportation conditions west of Kearney on the main line are more severe than those east of Kearney. The facts show that there is but relatively little branch line mileage on the Union Pacific west of Kearney. Mr. J. A. Little submitted studies showing the traffic density of lines in Nebraska as compared with lines operating In other states, and dealt to considerable exent with the Iowa situation showing that Nebraska is more favorably situated with regard to the traffic density </seg>
            <seg id="p163">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION than the state of Iowa. His exhibits also show that the C. B. &amp; Q. tonnage in Nebraska is increasing and has increased in greater propor - tion than that in Iowa, Wisconsin or Minnesota. The figures show that the traffic density of Nebraska, 1920 over 1916, had increased over 33%. He also dealt with the overhead tonnage pointing out that the overhead tonnage of the Union Pacific served to increase the traffic density in Nebraska but at the same time a considerable amount of this same tonnage also passes thru Iowa and that overhead tonnage from the coast also influenced the results for Wisconsin and Minnesota, so that Nebraska is no different in this respect than the other states, and in view of this fact there was no reason, from a traffic density standpoint, why Nebraska should be treated any differently than the states to the east which have been placed In zone 1 territory. The traffic density figures of certain states for 1929 were, Nebraska 1,174,353; Iowa 1,119,207; Wisconsin 1,173,737 and Minnesota 1,437,000 ton miles per mile of line. His figures show that the freight revenue per mile of road for Nebraska was slightly greater than that for Wisconsin, Iowa and South Dakota; that the revenue per ton mile for Nebraska was 11.36 mills with an average haul Qf 193.43 miles, which figure was in excess of the ton mile earnings of Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota and South Dakota traffic, altho the haul In Wisconsin was but 78.91 miles, Iowa 148.61 miles; Minnesota 108.28 miles and South Dakota 144.25 miles and in this connection Mr. Little pointed out that the accepted theory of the Interstate Commerce Commission is that the ton mile earnings should decrease as the haul increases, which would Indicate that Nebraska traffic, compared with the other states, has been yield - ing more than a proper revenue per ton mile. He also referred to the opearting ratios of the various states indicating that Nebraska figures were more favorable than the states shown except Minnesota. Other figures were introduced showing the cost of operation for the C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. east and west of the Missouri River, which showed that Ne - braska was as favorably located as Iowa. He also showed the number of tons of freight handled In various parts of Nebraska and showed that the number ot tons per person was considerably greater In the extreme western portion of the state than in the eastern part of the state, the first district in the extreme eastern part of Nebraska showing a figure approximately 77% of that of the 4th district in the extreme western part; that In the 4th district, the increase in the number of tons was considerably greater than in the other districts. Witness Little also introduced figures showing an analysis of the cost of operation on various operating divisions of the C. B. &amp; Q. located primarily within the state, together with a revision of the same figures introduced by Mr. Fletcher, accounting expert for the C. B. &amp; Q. These figures show, altho they probably do not contain all the costs of operation that it costs more to operate in the eastern half than in the western half of the state. Witness Little also pointed out that there Is considerably </seg>
            <seg id="p164">TWENTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT more branch line mileages in the eastern than in the western half of Nebraska. Using the figures submitted by Witness Little, we find that the operating costs, as shown by the C. B. &amp; Q. for eastern Nebraska for the year 1925 exceeded those in the western part by 45%. These same figures, according to Witness Little, as revised by Witness Fletcher, indicate that the same eastern district costs were approximately 24% greater than those for the western district Witness Little pointed out that of the total mileage in the western part of Nebraska, 70% constituted main line mileage and of the total mileage in the eastern part 30% represented main line mileage. In dealing with the rate situation, he stated that the lowest scales in effect in Nebraska today are substantially higher than the scale effective In Iowa; that at the present time the so-called Clark scale applies between Iowa and Nebraska; that a Nebraska shipper moving a ship - ment interstate into Iowa for a hundred mile haul pays 175% of the rate the Iowa shipper would have to pay for the same haul within the state of Iowa. Witness also called attention to the fact that the so - called Clark scale now in effect from 13 jobbing points in Nebraska was a commission made scale made for the purpose of removing undue prejudice existing between points along the Missouri River; that the Scale 1, prescribed by the Interstate Commerce Commission in Docket 17.000, Part 2, represented a re-grading of the Clark scale; that if the relationship of scale 1 to the Clark scale is about the same and if the Clark scale was a reasonable basis interstate in Nebraska, as well as intrastate, and in view of the similarity of traffic and transportation conditions in Nebraska, then Zone 1 scale would be appropriate for application throughout Nebraska as well as In Iowa. He referred to several decisions of the Interstate Commerce Commission prescribing uniform scales for movements of brick and other commodities through - out both the W. T. L. and the Southwestern territories. Evidence of Witness Little shows that a few of the carriers are establishing a store door delivery system In some territories, to compete with the trucks. Any substantial increase in the less carload rates will, in our opinion, act to drive more of this class of traffic to the trucks and compel the carriers, if they are to retain the traffic, to adopt more drastic means than merely establishing the kind of service referred to by Witness Little. We feel that to authorize excessive Increases In class rates would only serve to aggravate the situation and would not result In any benefit to anyone except that all would have the same level of rates, If one scale Is prescribed. Mr. C. E. Childe, on behalf of the Omaha Chamber of Commerce, presented studies dealing with the cost of transportation. These studies are similar to those introduced in I. C. C. Docket 17000, Part 2. It was his position that a dual scale of rates should be established, that is, one set for less carload traffic and one set for carload traffic; that </seg>
            <seg id="p165">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION such rates should be predicated upon the cost of transportation, the volume of traffic and what the traffic will bear, including actual terminal and line haul costs, plus a reasonable profit. He also pointed out that Mr. Oliver; a witness for the Missouri River Cities and later ap - parently adopted by the carriers, to some extent, submitted In Docket 17000, Part 2, cost figures dealing with the cost of transportation in C. F. A. territory as compared with the costs in W. T. L. territory. Mr. Oliver's figures, according to the witness, showed that in 1923 the rate levels in'W. T. L. territory should have been about 23% higher than in C. F. A. territory in order to produce the same revenue to the carriers; that in 1925, this figure had been reduced to 14% and at the present time the cost In W. T. L. territory is but 5% greater than in C. F. A. territory. We refer to the decision of the Interstate Commerce Commis - sion in the class rate case, 164 I. C. C. 1, where the Commission dealt to considerable extent upon the evidence adduced by the Missouri River Cities and the witness for Nebraska, relative to the cost studies and the dual scale of rates for less carload and carload traffic, and in dis - posing of this question said that for reasons stated altho in theory this plan had much in its favor, it was impossible to accept the dual scale proposed; that there were so many practical objections to it under the existing rate, traffic and commercial conditions within and without W. T. L. territory that it could not be accepted for class rate structure within W. T. L. territory alone. The Commission also stated that a con - siderable amount of testimony In the record was in favor of making class rate scales based on- cost plus a reasonable profit but that none was convincing by reason of the fact that direct costs had not been determined and that there were so many factors that could not be de - termined with accuracy. Because of these facts, we feel that the time is not here for the - making of rate scales predicated upon the cost basis. Mr. Childe did not introduce any specific rate proposal based upon his cost studies. Witness stated emphatically that from a cost, volume of service or transportation standpoint, the conditions in western Nebraska did not justify as high a level of rates as that prescribed for the western part of South Dakota, known as the Black Hills territory and further that these same factors did justify a uniform level of rates throughout Ne - braska. Several of the witnesses dealt with the truck situation in Nebraska. The Interstate Commerce Commission in its decision also referred to it We are fully aware of the fact that the short haul less carload traffic has moved to some extent from the rails of the carriers to the trucks. This situation, in so far as Nebraska is involved, is aggra - vated by the fact that we have one of the largest live stock markets in the world located at South Omaha, Nebraska, to which a considerable amount of live stock is trucked and that the truckers upon their return, </seg>
            <seg id="p166">TWENTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT pick up a considerable volume of tonnage that would otherwise move in less carload service over the rails of the carriers. Altho these problems have been presented to us as factors to be considered, we do not understand that under the law we can in any way take this situation into consideration in dealing with reasonable rate levels. These are problems that must be worked out by the manage - ments of the railroads. Evidence submitted on behalf of the Lincoln Chamber of Commerce dealt with the level of the scales proposed as compared with the scales known as the Clark scale and G. O. 19 scale. The exhibits submitted show that if the Clark Scale were applied throughout the territory it would materially increase many of the rates. Using the G. O. 19 rates as the 100% basis and distances up to 100 miles', the Clark scale would be 38%, Zone 2 55% and Zone 3 677o greater. For distances 101 to 200 miles, the Clark scale would be 20%, Zone 2 36%, Zone 3 47% greater. Combining the two, using distances from 1 to 200 miles, the Clark scale would be 29%; Zone 2, 46%, Zone 3, 57%. Witness pointed out that the longest movement that would obtain in either of the two zones would be about 300 miles. Mr. Whltten, referred to I. C. C. Docket 17000, Part 2, and quoted: " 'All interior Nebraska cities insist that traffic densities and traffic conditions in Nebraska compare favorably with those in Iowa, northern Missouri and Wisconsin and justify the same rate level in and between those states. Further the Commission says: 'Evidence introduced and views stated on behalf of the people of the state of Nebraska are expressly said to be those of the rate department of the Nebraska commission and the legal department of the state of Nebraska — Nebraska's spokesman as for a uni - form level of rates throughout W. T. L. territory. They contend that rates in Nebraska should be no higher than prevail east of the Missouri River.' * * * (R. 397) " 'Conditions prevalent in eastern Kansas and southeastern Nebraska do not differ greatly from the average conditions in the section east of the Missouri river, with the exception of the ex - treme eastern portion, so that there is some merit to the con - tention that the rate zone east of the Missouri river should be extended to embrace also eastern Kansas and southeastern Ne - braska.' (R. 398). "'However, there must be some zoning of Western Trunk Line territory in view of our findings in Southwestern cases, and there is necessity for an Intermediate or buffer zone In order to avoid too abrupt a change in rates between the eastern section of W. T. L. territory on the one hand, and on the other the western section and the southwest. Giving consideration to' all these mat - ters, this area reasonably should be included in Zone II.' " Stating that apparently Nebraska had lost only by a hair line . decision, that the figures really indicated that the zoning in Nebraska was made </seg>
            <seg id="p167">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION in order to avoid too abrupt changes in the rate levels. His testimony shows that the trend of traffic is east and west not north and south and' that the Nebraska rates should therefore be related to the rates found reasonable in the states lying to the east and west of Nebraska. Witness Whitten made the following statements: (1) "Any scale of rates you would prescribe for the eastern part ought to be applied throughout Nebraska. If the west needs help, there is a contribution from the eastern part of the state." (2) "I think every shipper here wants to see a just and rea - sonable basis of rates. If investigation of this case shows that the rates we are operating under today are too low, then they ought to be raised, and by the same token, if they are too high, they ought to be lowered. • * * The Commission * * * should lay down for Nebraska a just and reasonable basis of rates. That rate should be applied throughout the state alike." His position was that the Clark scale should be revised to bring the relationship of lower classes to first class in harmony with the class percentage relationship prescribed by the Interstate Commerce Com - mission. He stated that a considerable amount of less carload traffic was being diverted to the. trucks; that 74 trucking companies are serv - ing Lincoln daily; that a study made by his office for the first 15 days of May, 1930, indicated that 262 shipments were made by truck, total tonnage amounting to 42,332 pounds; that in the same period the C. B. &amp; Q. had 145 shipments, total tonnage 27,326 lbs.; Union Pacific 83 shipments, total tonnage 19,316 pounds; C. &amp; N. W. 54 shipments, total tonnage 9,914 pounds. In other words, 48% of the less carload traffic for that period moved out by truck; that the present packing and marking requirements prescribed by the Western Railway Inspection Bureau was also driving a certain amount of traffic to the trucks; that in his opinion these requirements should be modified; that Lincoln, from a purely selfish standpoint, would have the advantage, If zone 3 were prescribed in the western part of the state and zone 2 in the eastern part, but that all of the facts show that there is no difference in transportation conditions that would justify a higher scale in the western part than in the eastern part of the state. Mr. E. P. Ryan, traffic manager of the Grand Island Chamber of Commerce and president of the Nebraska Traffic League, representing numerous points throughout central and western Nebraska, took the position that the present scales of rates In Nebraska, that is the Clark Scale and G. O. 19 scale should be eliminated that the Clark scale as modified by an adjustment of relationship of the lower classes, should apply throughout the state; that, the prescribing of two scales of rates acts to stifle competition and reduce the trade territory of the various communities ; that the Clark scale prescribed by the Interstate Commerce Commission was later adopted by the carriers as a basis for publishing rates to and from Nebraska points on the one hand and interstate </seg>
            <seg id="p168">TWENTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT points on the other, and has since been a yard stick In a good many class rate scales prescribed by the Interstate Commerce Commission; that the prescribing of two scales of rates would make certain "humps" between stations which would create undue preference and unjust dis - crimination between shippers and localities. Witness referred to the class rate scale prescribed in I. C. C. Docket 14999 for application in Arizona, and stated that the Clark scale prescribed for a territory with a greater density of traffic was somewhat higher than the Arizona scale prescribed for a territory having a lower traffic density. It was also the opinion of the witness that commodity rates on specific articles should not be related to the class rates. Figures submitted by Witness Ryan, reproduced here to some extent show that the zone 2 scale for the total ten classes up to 100 miles, 200 miles and 300 miles superimposed upon like totals and distances of either the Clark Scale or the G. O. 19 scale, would result in Increases varying from 6.75% to 46.85% and the superimposing of zone 3 scale upon like figures for the G.

R. .Wigton, in charge of the traffic bureau of the Sioux City Chamber of Commerce offered testimony relating to the position of Sioux City, Iowa, stating that he thought there should he a uniform basis between Nebraska state and interstate rates. In. response to the following question: Q. "I would like to ask, that if the scale of- zone 2 rates were extended across Nebraska, how would it affect your territory?" Mr. Wigton had this to say: A. "We are not concerned in the volume of the rate * • • that is the general attitude of most jobbing centers, providing the rates are not so high as to restrict movement. If a uniform level were maintained we would be perfectly satisfied. We are not particularly concerned how the rates are made, what their level is, is what we are interested in, so we will all be on a parity with our competitors." (R. 461) Witness also stated that In his opinion the traffic conditions in north - east Nebraska were no different than those existing in southwest Min - nesota or northwest Iowa. No greater amount of evidence has been submitted regarding the rate levels or the percentages of first class that should apply on various miscellaneous commodities. We are, therefore, not sufficiently informed as to percentages of first class certain specific commodities should take and will not prescribe any percentages other than for the 10 classes. If shippers or carriers desire to have established or to establish commodity rates on certain specified articles by relating those rates' to percentages of first class other than the 10 classes prescribed, appropriate complaints or applications should be filed with this Com - mission and the matter decided upon a more complete record. We may take it for granted that the class rate traffic will bear an increase in rates but we are of the opinion that to place too much of an added burden upon the shippers in the western part of Nebraska will act to stifle further industrial development in this part of the state. A study of the state of Nebraska shows that there are many thriving towns in the western part of Nebraska which would be placed at a marked disadvantage If we were to prescribe two scales of rates In Nebraska. In the testimony submitted in the present proceeding, we are unable to locate anything that justifies an arbitrary break-up of the state into two zones. This record clearly discloses the fact that traffic density in the western part of Nebraska is greater than in the eastern part; that conditions are more favorable for the handling' of traffic In the </seg>
            <seg id="p170">TWENTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT western part; that traffic originating and terminating in the western part of the state is greater per capita and that there is less branch line mileage. The Interstate Commerce Commission in the Southwestern Cases, 123 I. C. C, and in the Divisions Case, 148 I. C. C. 457, found that the traffic conditions in the Southwest were not greatly less favorable than in Nebraska and outside of differentials prescribed for the western part of Texas prescribed a uniform scale of class rates for all of the south - west. Under the law, it is our duty to prevent unjust discriminations as between carriers, shippers and localities. Certainly a scale for western Nebraska higher than for eastern Nebraska is not justified by either the cost or the value of service and as stated by the Interstate Commerce Commission in Docket 17000, Part 2, 164 I. C. C. 1, page 181— "There is a limit to the maximum reasonableness of class rates, if the traffic thereunder is to move freely. Class-rate traf - fic is of such a nature that it may well be expected to sustain rates relatively higher than other business, giving due regard to the rate levels in adjoining territories and to what the traffic will bear." From the testimony presented In this case, we must take the posi - tion that only one scale of cla.ss rates should apply throughout the entire state. We have tried to view the record with the end in view of going along with the Interstate Commerce Commission findings, but believe that it is not fair to either the carriers or shippers to, at this time, enter an order allowing the scales prescribed by the Interstate Commerce Com - mission and more especially so in view of the fact that the Iowa Com - mission has entered its class rate order prescribing a scale of rates which is somewhat below those prescribed by the Interstate Commerce Commission for Iowa interstate application. Our . files also show that the state of Colorado has denied the application of the carriers to publish the interstate scales for Intrastate application within that state. The Wyoming Commission, in entering Its order, prescribed a scale of rates for distances up to 500 miles that is approximately 99% of the' zone 2 rates. As heretofore stated, in fairness to the carriers and shippers. It would appear that If we were to follow the decision of the Interstate Commerce Commission we would be placing them at a serious disad - vantage by reason of the fact that rates In the states east and west would be on a lower level than those in Nebraska, which, in our opinion, would automatically act to create unreasonable and prejudicial rate situations. We are of the opinion that the present Clark scale is high; that the conditions existing at the time this scale was prescribed are more </seg>
            <seg id="p171">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION favorable in Nebraska at -the present time; that there is no real justifi - cation for a higher level of rates in Nebraska than in effect in Iowa Yet, we are mindful of the fact that the Missouri River jobbing points in other states are in competition, at least to some extent, with jobbers located in Nebraska. Therefore, we find, without passing upon the rea - sonableness of the scale Itself, that for the present, and until such a time as the class rates in states east and west of Nebraska shall have been finally adjusted, that the zone 2 scale set forth in the appendix shall apply on all class rate traffic throughout the entire state; that the following percentages of that scale shall apply on the so-called lower classes: Classes 1234 5ABCD E Percentage 100 85 70 55 37.5 45 32.5 30 22.5 17.5 We also find that the present exceptions to Western Classification ap - plicable on Nebraska traffic shall continue without change except on appropriate proceedings. ' We further find that the carriers should have relief from the long and short haul clause of the statute. Being thoroughly familiar with the situation in Nebraska, we know that there is very little joint line traffic. Therefore, the prescribing of a scale for joint line traffic will not affect, to any great degree the revenues of the individual carriers. The record indicates that there is no objection to joint line rates being prescribed and the method for figuring the single line rates, shown below, should- also apply for com - puting rates on joint line traffic. We therefore find that the rates prescribed shall apply on single and joint line traffic, the C. &amp; N. W. Ry. Co., and C. St P. M. &amp; O. Ry. being considered as one line and the St. J. &amp; G. I. Ry. and Union Pacific railroad being considered as one line. The method for figuring distances and rates to be as follows: That In computing all distances for the determination of reasonable rates under the scale of rates here - in prescribed the shortest possible route shall be used over which car - load traffic can be Interchanged without transfer of lading. The record shows no serious objections to the proposal of the car - riers to establish small groups throughout the state and the publishing of rates between such groups by the use of so-called key points. We therefore find that the carriers may establish the same group key points Intrastate as are used on Interstate for use In determining the mileages upon which rates are to be published with a provision that rates for distances up to 75 miles shall not exceed the maximum scale. We further find that the class rates herein prescribed shall apply as maximum rates on all commodities rates now in effect. We further find, no evidence having been submitted to the contrary, </seg>

Ap - pellants thereupon gave notice of appeal, and for the purpose of per - fecting the same, under date of October 1, 1930, filed with the clerk of this court their transcript. The dates above given are material, for it is the contention of the appellee that appellants did not file their transcript with the clerk of this court within the time fixed by statute, and that by reason thereof this court has no jurisdiction to hear or consider the case, and it is this challenge to the jurisdiction ot the court that first demands our attention. The order of the State Railway Commission from which this appeal is undertaken, bears date June 16, 1930. The motion for a new trial was filed June 21, 1930, and the transcript was filed with the clerk of this court on October 1, '1930. The law providing for appeals from orders and decisions of the State Railway Commission is set forth in section 75-505, Comp. St 1929, and. In so tar as it is material to the question here involved, reads: "The procedure to obtain such reversal, modification or vacation of any such order or regulation made and adopted, upon which a hearing has been had before the Commission, shall be governed by the same provisions now In force with reference to appeals and error proceedings from the district court to the Supreme Court of Nebraska. The evidence presented before the Railway Commission, as reported by its official stenographer and reduced to writing, shall be duly certified by the stenographer and the chairman of the Railway Commission as the true bill of exceptions, which together - with the pleadings and filings duly certified in the case under the seal of the Railway Commission, shall constitute the . complete record and the evidence upon which the case shall be presented to the appellate court: Provided, however, the time for appeal from the orders and rulings of the Railway Commisison to the Supreme Court shall be limited to three months." </seg>

"That I appeared in said proceeding for and on behalf of the sub - scribers thereof and the Chamber of Commerce of the City of Seward; that the first notice which I had ot the commission's order entered herein was on June 20, 1930, about the hour of 9:00 when the morning mail was delivered; that I then received the copy of the order of the Commission transmitted to me by the secretary thereof under date of June 19, 1930, mailed from the office of the Railway Commission in Lincoln, Nebraska; on the same day I prepared a motion for new trial and rehearing and deposited the same in the mails directed to the Ne - braska State Railway Commission; that it was impossible for me to have filed a motion for new trial or rehearing before the 20th day of June, 1930, as that was the day on which I first received notice from the Commission, that the order was received in the morning and the same day the motion was sent out . "(Signed) Chas. F. Barth. "Subscribed in my presence and sworn to before me this day of May, 1931. "Signed) L. H. McKillip, "Notary Public. "(Seal) My commission expires Jan. 19, 1935." No finding by the Railway Commission that appellants were "un - avoidably prevented" from filing their motion for new trial within three days after the findings and decision of the Railway Commission from which they seek to appeal, appears in the record. In Aultman, Miller &amp; Cd. v. Leahey, 24 Neb. 286, paragraph one of the syllabus reads: "A question raised and presented only by a motion for a new trial, made after the expiration of three days after the verdict or decision, or by an amendment made after such three days to a mo - tion previously filed In any case not specially excepted by the pro - visions of section 316 of the Code, should not be considered by the </seg>
            <seg id="p178">TWENTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT trial court, and if it is, such consideration will not be held binding by this court." In the body of the opinion in the above case, Justice Cobb, in speak - ing upon the question here under consideration, said: "This amendment embodies a new and definite assignment of error. It was not made until the fourth day after the verdict was rendered, after the expiration of the time limited by the Code, with - out the finding by the court that the plaintiff 'was unavoidably pre - vented' from a compliance with the statute, as a palliation for the amendment" In Davis v. Taylor &amp; Son, 92 Neb. 769, paragraph two of the syllabus reads: "Questions presented by an amendment to a motion for a new trial, made more than three days after verdict and without a finding of the court that the party was unavoidably prevented from present - ing such questions within three days from the verdict will not be considered by this court Guillion v. Traver, 64 Neb. 51." Whether a motion for new trial was a necessary step in order to obtain a review of the findings and decision of the State Railway Com - mission is not decided; but, if it was necessary, such motion was not filed within the time limited by the Code and was, therefore, of no avail. If, however, the filing and overruling of a motion for a new trial was not a necessary proceeding for such a review In this court, then the transcript for appeal, having been filed in this court more than three months after the date of the findings and decision of the State Rallway Commisslon from which appellants seek relief, would not give the court jurisdiction and the appeal should be dismissed. Splittgerber Bros. v. Skinner Packing Co., 119 Neb. 135. The appeal is, therefore, dismissed at appellants' costs. APPEAL DISMISSED. (122 Neb. Rep. 325.) IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway Co., et al. v. No. 287 United States of America, et al. Decided January 4, 1932. Appeal from the District Court of the United States for the Northern District of Illinois. SYLLABUS 1. Pursuant to the "Hoch-Smith Resolution" of January 20, 1925, c. 120, 43 Stat. 801, the Interstate Commerce Commission made a general </seg>
            <seg id="p179">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION investigation of rate structures in the Western District, including those on grain. Exhaustive hearings, produclve of a very voluminous record, were closed in September, 1928. Later the Commission made its order, prescribing maximum rates on grain and grain products, the effective date of which was postponed from time to time. In February, 1931, before the order became effective, the carriers . petitioned for a re - opening of the case, setting up in detail, and offering to prove, that, since the closing of the record, in 1928, economic changes had seriously impaired their earnings and their credit; that the order would reduce their revenues greatly, and regardless of the question of Its validity and propriety when made, it would no longer be valid and proper in the ex - isting circumstances, and would threaten the maintenance of an ade - quate system of transportation. They insisted upon the reopening as a right guaranteed to them not only by the Act of Congress but by the Constitution itself. Held: (1) The petition was not an ordinary petition for rehearing, but was .of the nature of a supplemental bill, presenting a new and radically different situation, which had supervened since the record before the Commission had been closed. (2) The Court takes judicial notice of the' economic depression amounting to a changed economic level, severally affecting the rail - roads, which has come about since the Commission closed its hear - ings in this case in September, 1928; and of the existence of this depression in February, 1931, when the carriers' petition was filed. (3) Denial of the petition exceeded the permitted range of the Commission's discretion and cannot be sustained. 2. While in fixing future rates the Commission doubtless must act upon the conditions disclosed in the record before it and cannot ac - curately provide for future fluctuations, this does not justify denial of a petition to reopen a case when overruling economic forces have pro - duced a new economic level to which the record before the Commission is irresponsive. 3. The prospect that the hearing before the Commission may be long does not juslfy its denial, if the hearing be required by the essential de - mands of justice. 4. The legal standards governing the Commission in determining the reasonableness of rates were not altered by the "Hoch-Smith Resolu - tion"; and a fair hearing Is a fundamental requirement MR. CHIEF JUSTICE HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court. These suits, which were consolidated, were brought by carriers by railroads in the Western District, and by certain shippers, to restrain </seg>
            <seg id="p180">TWENTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT the enforcement of an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission made July 1, 1930, as amended by a supplemental order of April 10, 1931. The order prescribed maximum rates for the transportation of grain and grain products on domestic shipments within the Western District and for export, as described, and directed the carriers to desist from certain practices (164 I. C. C. 619; 173 Id. 511). Other carriers were permitted to intervene as parties petitioners, and state commissions and certain state organizations were admitted as intervening defendants. This appeal is from the order of the District Court, as specially constituted, denying the applications of the petitioners for an interlocutory injunction. Following the passage of the Joint Resolution of the Congress of January 30, 1925, known as the Hoch-Smith Resolution, the Interstate Commerce Commission instituted a general investigation of the rate structures of common carriers to determine whether their rates, charges, regulations and practices were unjust, unreasonable, unjustly discrim - inatory or unduly preferential or otherwise in violation ot law. The investigation was divided into separate parts, and the proceeding in one of them (Part VII) terminated in the order under review. In connection with this proceeding there were a large number of formal complaints and suspension proceedings which, considered together, brought into issue all phases of the grain rate structure involved in the Commis - sion's general investigation. Many state commissions, chambers of com - merce, and trade and traffic associations participated in the proceeding. Hearings were held in many cities and extended over a year. The record was closed on September 22, 1928, and after protracted argument the matter! was submitted, on July 1, 1929, to the Commission for its decision. The first report of the Commission, made on July 1, 1930, emphasized the magnitude of this task in dealing with "three score and more of major issues, affecting every part of. a vast territorial domain", and the thorough examination that had been made- of the exceptionally voluminous record. The order of July 1, 1930, was to go into effect on October 1, 1930, but because of mechanical difficulties in the prepara - tion and printing of the tariffs, containing the great number of the re - vised rates, the effective date was postponed from time to time. In September, 1930, the carriers; asked for a rehearing, which was denied In November, 1930. Prior to its denial, a statement was sub - mitted to the Commission on behalf of the Western Association of Rail - way Executives, directing attention to the serious financial condition of the carriers. A further petition for rehearing was presented to the Com - mission on February 18, 1931. This petition described In great detail the situation then existing. The carriers alleged that since the closing of the record before the Commission in September, 1928, there had been material and Important changes in the operating, traffic and transporta - tion conditions in] the Western District, which affected adversely the revenues of the carriers, and that, regardless of the question of the </seg>
            <seg id="p181">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION validity and propriety of the order when made, it would no longer be valid and proper in the light of the existing conditions. The carriers alleged and offered to prove that, if the order became effective, it would reduce the gross and net operating revenues of the carriers in the Western District not less than $20,000,000 annually; that their aggregate revenues in the first eleven months of 1930 were 14.92 per cent lower than In the corresponding period of 1929; that the complete figures In respect of the revenues for December, 1930, were not yet available but that the volume of traffic then carried was substantially less than that of December, 1929 ; that the revenue freight car loadings in January, 1931, showed a sub - stantial decline (14.06 per cent) from those of 1930 and an even greater decline (20.98 per cent) as compared with those of 1929; that the net operating income of' these carriers for 1930 was over $100,000,000 less than their average annual net operating income for the five preceding years; that the changes in conditions since the record before the Com - mission was closed had been such as seriously to impair the credit of the carriers; that not only had the market price of their common and preferred stock declined to such a level that it would be Impossible for them to secure additional capital through the sale of stock, but that their bond issues also, in many instances, had ceased to command the credit which they formerly enjoyed; that the decrease of railroad earn - ings had been such as to jeopardize the eligibility of these bonds for savings bank Investments, and that there had been a large decline in the holdings of the securities of these carriers by both savings banks and life insurance companies; and that if the order of the Commission should become effective, It would, under the conditions then present, threaten the maintenance of an adequate system of transportation. In support of their allegations as to changed conditions, the petitioners submitted many other facts and statistical tables of traffic and revenues. The Commission denied the application for rehearing on March 3, 1931. On April 10, 1931, the Commission made its supplemental report and order, modifying and supplementing In certain particulars its or - iginal report and order, and provided that the order as thus modified should become effective on June 1, 1931. Thereupon, these suits were brought. The petition in the carriers' suit challenged the order as having been made in disregard of the provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act The original and supplemental reports of the Commission, and the above mentioned petitions for rehearing, were annexed to the petition and made a part of it Reference was made to the statement of the Commis - sion, in its special report of January 21, 1931, to the Senate Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, that the railroads had "never been able, since 1920, to obtain the aggregate earnings contemplated by sec - tion 15a" (of the Interstate Commerce Act) "and they are faced with continually increasing competition from other forms of transportation." </seg>
            <seg id="p182">TWENTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT Reciting earlier orders of the Commission bearing upon rates for the transportation of grain and grain products, the carriers averred that the order of' the Commission was a complete reversal of its previous action; that the Commission had found that the revenues of the carriers for the Western District from the carriage of grain and grain products amounts to 124 per cent of their total revenues in 1924, that year being used in the report as representative, and that the effect of the order in question would be to reduce the general level of rates on this traffic approximately 13 per cent, causing a serious diminution (to the amount of $20,000,000 annually) in the gross and net operating income of these carriers. The petition set forth the passage of the Hoch-Smith Resolu - tion and the order of the Commission in relation to the rates on de - ciduous fruits from California, which had been held' by this Court to be invalid because based upon an erroneous construction of the Resolution, and the carriers charged that, in making the reports and order here in question, the Commission had proceeded upon a like misconception of its powers. Stating the substance of their petition (February, 1931) for rehearing, the carriers further charged that the denial of that petition, in view of changed conditions, was itself an abuse of administrative dis - cretion and, by depriving the carriers of the hearing to which they were entitled, constituted a denial of due process In violation of the Filth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. In their answers, the United States and the Commission denied that the action of the Commission was in any respect unauthorized or un - lawful, and on the contrary alleged that the Commission had carefully considered the evidence before it in the light of its experience and that the evidence fully supported its order. On the application for an interlocutory injunction, the evidence taken before the Commission was not presented to the District Court. Affi - davits were submitted by the carriers which were addressed to the ef - fect of the order upon their revenues. The District Court made flna - ings of fact, reciting the findings set forth in the' report of the Com - mission and, in the view that these were conclusive in the absence of the evidence, and that no errors of law had been committed, the applica - tion was denied. The appellants contest this conclusion, contending that the report of the Commission and concurring opinions of Commissioners disclosed that the Commission had misapprehended its authority under the Hoch- Smith Resolution and that the Commission had failed to make the find - ings which were essential to support its decision under the applicable law; that this was shown by the special and extended consideration given by the Commission to the depression of agriculture and the lack of other and proper foundation for the order; that the Commission had not performed its duty to consider and apply the provisions of Section </seg>
            <seg id="p183">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 16a of the Interstate Commerce Act and had exceeded Its power by re - sorting to different standards from those established by Sections 1 and 16 of the Act; and that the ultimate finding of the Commission, expressed in the words of the statute, that the existing rates were unreasonable to the extent that they exceeded the rates prescribed, was not In itself sufficient to support the order, as it otherwise appeared to have been erroneously based. We do not find it to be necessary to consider these contentions, and the counter arguments advanced on behalf of the Commission, or to review the Commission's reports, as it is sufficient for the present pur - pose to deal with the fundamental question presented by the action of the Commission In denying the appellants' second application for a rehear - ing. Ordinarily, a petition for rehearing is for the purpose of directing attention to matters said to have been overlooked or mistakenly con - ceived in the original decision and thus Invites a reconsideration upon the record upon which that decision rested. The second petition for rehearing, in this proceeding, was not of that character. It was of the nature of a supplemental bill. It presented a new situation, a radically different one, which has supervened since the record before the Com - mission had been closed in September, 1928. It asserted, that whatever might be the view of the order when made, and upon that record, a changed economic condition demanded reopening and reconsideration. The carriers insisted upon this reopening as a right guaranteed to them not only by the Act of Congress but by toe Constitution itself. There can be no question as to the change in conditions upon which the new hearing was asked. Of that change we may take judicial notice. It is the outstanding contemporary fact, dominating thought and action throughout the country. As the Interstate Commerce Commission said in its recent report to the Congress, "a depression such as the country is now passing through is a new experience to the present generation." The Commission also recognized in that report "the very large reduc - tions in railroad earnings which- have accompanied the economic de - pression," and stated that "the chief cause of these reductions has been loss of traffic." For "in such depressions the railroads suffer severely. Their traffic is a barometer of general business conditions." It is, plain that a record which was closed In September, 1928 — relating to rates on a major description of the traffic of the carriers In a vast territory — cannot be regarded as representative of the conditions existing in 1931. That record pertains to a different economic era and furnishes no adequate criterion of present requirements. While the effects of the widespread economic disturbance have had a progressive manifestation, they had been sufficiently revealed in February, 1931, when -the second petition for rehearing was made, to compel the con - clusion that the record of 1928 afforded no sufficient basis for the order </seg>
            <seg id="p184">TWENTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT Of the Commission. The facts were set forth in the carriers' petition. They pointed out the grave reductions, in traffic and earnings, from which they were suffering, that their net operating income for 1930 was over $100,000,000 less than their average annual net operating income for the five years preceding, and that their credit was seriously impaired. At the time of this petition, the order revising the rates on grain and grain products in the Western District had not yet become effective, but the Commission stood upon the record of 1928 and, without reopening the proceeding or taking further evidence, provided that its order should be - come effective on June 1, 1931. In justification of this course, it is urged on behalf of the Commission that Its determination had been reached after regularly conducted and protracted hearings in which car - riers and shippers had cooperated and that the adjustments related not only to the level of rates but to the relation of rates and to discriminatory and wasteful practices, and that a reopening would have meant further lengthy proceedings. It is Said that "in performing Its legislative func - tion of prescribing reasonable rates, the Commission necessarily pro - jects into the future the results of a decision based on the conditions disclosed in the record," and that its determination "cannot reflect ac - curately fluctuating conditions." These suggestions would be appropriate in relation to ordinary applications for rehearing, but are without force when overruling economic forces have made the record before the Com - mission irresponsive to present conditions. This is not the usual case of possible fluctuating conditions, but of a changed economic level. And the prospect that a hearing may be long does not justify Its denial if it is required by the essential demands of justice. We are thus brought to the fundamental considerations governing the authority of the Commission. It has broad powers and a wide extent of administrative discretion, with the exercise of which, upon evidence, and within its statutory limits, the courts do not Interfere. The im - portant and salutary functions of the Commission to enforce public rights are not to be denied or impaired. But the Commission, exercising a delegated regulatory authority which does not have the freedom of own - ership, operates in a field limited by constitutional rights and legislative requirements. Its duty under Sections 1 (5), 3 (1) and 15 (1) of the Interstate Commerce Act with respect to the prescribing of reasonable rates and the preventing of unreasonable or unjustly discriminatory or unduly preferential practices, has not been changed by the Hoch-Smith Resolution. Ann Arbor R. Co. v. United States, 281 U. S. 658, 669. The legal standards governing the action of the Commission In determining the reasonableness of rates are unaltered. In the discharge of its duty, a fair hearing is a fundamental requirement. Interstate Commerce Com - mission v. Louisville &amp; Nashville R. Co., 227 U. S. 88, 91.

            <seg id="p185">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION permitted the presentation of evidence relating to existing conditions; was denied. We think that this action was not within the permitted range of the Commission's discretion, but was a denial of right The order of the Commission which was thus made effective, and the ensuing supplemental order, cannot be sustained. The order of the District Court refusing an interlocutory injunction is reversed, and the cause is remanded with direction to grant the in - junction as prayed. REVERSED. (284 U. S. 248) OPINIONS BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND HIS STAFF In addition to participating .in the Interstate Commerce Commission cases shown in Part 1, the Attorney General's office furnished the Com - mission with the following opinions on general questions of law: Answering the inquiry submitted by the State Railway Commission at the request of Mr. C. O. Stukenholtz, this department bas this to say: Mr. Stukenholtz's question may be stated as follows: May a public grain warehouseman, duly licensed and bonded, send stored grain to another warehouse for storage or must he retain It In his own warehouse? It Is understood that some warehousemen desire to forward grain in storage to terminal warehouses. It is the opinion of this department that a warehouseman may not surrender possession of stored grain, although fully covered by bond, to another warehouseman. It must be understood that it is not necessary that the identical grain be held; the warehouse law contemplates that the grain is fungible and that it is only necessary that an equal amount of grain of the same grade as that received be kept on hand, unless stored "Identity preserved.'.' The position herein stated Is different from that of the State Railway Commission when proceeding under the warehouse law of 1915 as amended (Sec. 7224, et sea.., C. S., 1922). The 1915 law remained in effect until March 17, 1930. During the period 1915-1930, the State Railway Commission permitted warehousemen to ship grain to terminal markets, within the state, for storage, provided such grain was fully covered by bond. Thus, a warehouseman having a warehouse of ten thousand bushels capacity might receive twenty-flve thousand bushels of grain for storage. Under such circumstances, the amount of grain in excess of what he stored in his own elevator was covered by bond and stored in a warehouse at a terminal point This method of operation appeared to work admirably and not a dollar of </seg>
            <seg id="p186">TWENTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT any grain grower's money was lost by any warehouse operating under a license issued by the State Railway Commission. The method followed by the State Railway Commission was, how - ever, sharply criticized by some warehousemen and by others also, and under the law approved March 17, 1930, and in effect until superseded by the present law, which became effective August 3, 1931, it was ex - pressly provided that (Sec. 88-211, C. S., 1929) grain equal in amount and of the same or better grade as that for which warehouse receipts were outstanding should at all times be kept In the warehouse issuing such receipts, unless the holders of the warehouse receipts consented to a transfer to a terminal warehouse; when the grain was transferred to such a warehouse, a new receipt was issued. The present law does not contain such a provision. While the present law (Laws, 1931, Chapter 160, page 423) is In many respects the same as the law of 1915, there are some important differences. The law of 1915 did not require that warehouses at terminal points (such points to be designated by the State Railway Commission) should give bond. Nor did It specify any termination dates for storage contracts. Under the present law, terminal points are not designated by the Commission and termination dates for storage contracts are specifically provided. The question here presented has never been be - fore the Supreme Court so there are no guiding decisions in this state. The general rule Is that a warehouseman of fungible grain should al - ways retain sufficient grain to deliver all stored grain (27 Ruling Case Law, Title Warehouses, Sec. 37, pp. 980-981. Yokey v. Smith (111.) 54 N. E. 1048). A consideration of the several sections of the present ware - house law leads to the conclusion that it follows the general rule. Among the provisions of the law that appear to require that the stored grain shall, at all times, be in the warehouse, the following appear important: Section 2 specifies, among other things, that the application for a warehouse license shall set forth location of the warehouse, its relation to railroad trackage, capacity, general plan, equipment, ownership, and the amount ot grain handled during the previous year. It also requires that the application shall be accompanied by a bond "for an amount equal to the full value of all grain held in storage at any one time," and that in case of delay In delivery of the grain or full payment there - for, the warehouseman shall be liable on his bond. Section 5 calls for the making of reports showing "the amount of grain in store on the last day of the preceding month," and that if the value of the grain held "in store" exceeds the amount of the bond, addi - tional bond must be required. Section 7 is, in part, as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p187">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION "Upon demand, presentation of any receipts, and payment of lawful charges, the grain represented therein,' or any part thereof, shall be immediately delivered to the owner, or his order, and the part sB delivered shall not be subject to any further charge for storage after demand for delivery shall have been made and facil - ities for receiving and shipping the same have been provided. In case demand is made for a part only of the grain represented by any receipt, the amount so delivered shall be entered In a proper blank upon the face of said receipt and delivery thereof acknowl - edged thereon by the person holding said receipt. For any grain not delivered within twenty- four hours after such demand, the warehouseman shall be liable upon his bond, to the owner in dam - ages not exceeding one cent a bushel for each day's delay, unless he shall deliver to different owners in the order demanded as rap - idly as can be done by ordinary diligence. In case terminal de - livery ofi grain is demanded, the warehouseman shall forthwith Issue and deliver to the owner or his order a surrender receipt, which shall conform to the receipt issued for the grain under Sec - tion Six of this Act, making such grain deliverable in its net amount at any terminal market and/or transit points designate:! by the owner of said receipt. Such grain shall be subject to the usual freight, weighing and switching charges when it arrives at the terminal so designated, the freight to be computed on the basis of the gross weight of the grain represented by such sur - render receipt, the owner of the receipt may at his option order the car in which the grain covered by his surrender receipt is to be transported, and in such case the grain shall be delivered when the car so ordered is placed at the warehouse." Section 11 'fixed the termination dates of the contracts of storage and concludes with the following language: "In the absence of a demand for delivery, order to sell, or mutual agreement for the renewal of the storage contract entered Into prior to the expiration of the storage contract, as prescribed in this Act, the warehouse shall, upon the expiration of the storage contract, sell such stored grain at the local market price on the close of business on that date, deduct from the proceeds thereof all legal accrued charges, and pay the balance of such proceeds to the owner upon surrender of the warehouse receipts." As noted above. Section 11 was not in the 1915 Statute. Unless the grain is actually to be in the warehouse, it is improbable that settle - ment would be made on the basis of sale at the local market price. The language of the several sections above referred to seems to require that the grain must at all times, while the storage contract exists, be physically present in the warehouse. You have handed me opinion and finding of the Nebraska State Railway Commission in Formal Complaint No. 682. The Commission holds that Seection 74-519, C. S. for 1929, commonly called the "Full Crew Law", is complied with by having the crew consist of one brake - man and one porter Instead of one brakeman and one flagman. The train </seg>
            <seg id="p188">TWENTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT consists of more than five cars, and the sole question is whether or not the porter who has passed the examination of a brakeman and is quali - fied to perform the duties of a brakeman or flagman, may be considered a brakeman or flagman within the meaning of the statute. We think not The statute in question. Section 74-619, C. S. for 1929, reads as follows: "It shall be unlawful for any railroad company doing business in the State of Nebraska to operate or run over its road or any part thereof, or suffer or permit to be run over its road or any part thereof, outside of the yard limits, any passenger, mail or express train carrying passengers, whose regular equipment con - sists of more than five cars, with a crew, consisting of less than one engineer, one fireman, one conductor, one brakeman and one flagman; and further provided, passenger trains whose regular equipment consists of five cars or less, may be operated with a crew consisting ot one engineer, one fireman, one conductor and one brakeman or flagman." A porter is not a brakeman. The statute says that the crew shall consist among others, of one brakeman and one flagman. The statute does not say that the crew shall consist of one brakeman and some other person qualified to act as flagman. If a porter who has passed the ex - amination required of a brakeman may be substituted for the flagman, then your Commission would have to also say that a porter who ' has passed the examination required of the conductor could be substituted for the conductor. The same rule might even apply to the engineer and the fireman. If so, then a train might be manned by five porters drawing salaries of porters, provided that one of them had passed the examinations required of an engineer, one of them had passed the ex - amination required of a fireman, one of them had passed the examina - tions required of a conductor, and two of them had passed the examina - tions required of a brakeman. in our opinion to say that the porter can act as a flagman is an evasion of the statute. A case almost identical was beforee the Supreme Court ot Pennsyl - vania in the case of Public Service Commission v. Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, 103 Atlantic 724. In that case the court said: "Complaint was made to the Public Service Commission, that the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company was operating one of its passenger trains over its road with a crew of but five, in. viola - tion of section 5 of the act of June 19, 1911, (P'. L. 1053), known as the "Full Crew Act." The train consists of an engine, one express car, one baggage car, one dining car and two passenger cars, two Pullman sleeping cars and one Pullman parlor car carry - i ing passengers. The complaint was sustained by the Commission. | The railroad company appealed to the Superior Court, and from ' its decree reversing the Public Service Commission and dismissing ' the complaint we have this appeal by the commission. </seg>

            <seg id="p190"/>
            <seg id="p191">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION "It is admitted that as to five members of the crew which operated the train in question there was compliance with the act of 1911, requiring its crew to consist of not less than six. These five were an engineer, a .fireman, a conductor, a baggageman and a flagman. The controversy Is to the sixth, who, the company contends, ought to be regarded as the brakeman required by the Full Crew Act. Whether he ought to be so regarded depends upon undisputed facts. He was the conductor on the dining car, and his duties were to assign the passengers entering it to proper seats, to give each one a blank order for a meal, to receive from the waiters all money handed to them by the diners, to settle In checks, and to return, through the waiters, any change which might be coming to the passengers. In short, he was the manager of the dining car. The evidence upon which the Superior Court held, that he ought to be regarded as a brakeman was that the conductor in charge of the train could at any time have called upon him to act in that capacity; in other words, that he might act In the dual capacity of dining car conductor and brakeman. As to this the Public Service Commission ruled: " 'In order to comply with the statute a brakeman must be a brakeman all the time. He may not be a brakeman part of the time and a dining car conductor part of the time, and it is obvious that he cannot be both at the same time.' "As a' matter of fact, Thurman, the dining car conductor, was not performing any of the duties of a brakeman on the train. Its conductor, called by the appellee, testified that he was a dining car conductor 'all the way through,' and was a brakeman only when called upon by him to be one; but the admission of this witness at the same time was that he had never been so called. The dining car conductor, also called as a witness by the ap - pellee, testified that he had always performed only the duties of such a conductor, and did not even know what- wages were paid to a brakeman. This, without more, clearly shows a failure on the part of the appellee to comply with the statute. Admitting that the train conductor could at any time have called upon the dining car conductor to act as a' brakeman, that he was so quali - fied to act, and that it would have been his duty to respond to the call of the train conductor, the situation Is not helped. The statute required that the train should have, as one of Its operating crew, a brakeman on it all the time it was being operated. "His duties being to assist in the safe operation of it, and not to supervise and manage a dining room on It. The statute is clear and controlling, and there is not to be substituted for its requirement this judgment of the conductor of a train, or of any one else, as to when, in its operation, there ought to be a brake - man on it; and yet this, in effect, is the contention of the ap - pellee, for admittedly the dining car conductor was to be a brake - man only when called upon by the train conductor to act as such. It may be again noted that the dining car conductor never, at any time acted in that capacity, and the train all the time he was on it was therefore without a brakeman. How, then, can It be said that the appellee has complied with the act of 1911? The wisdom of its clear provision as to the size of a crew is not for courts. Their duty is confined to enforcing as a piece of legisla - tion not prohibited by the Constitution. (Pennsylvania Railroad </seg>

"The order of the Superior Court is reversed, and that of the Public Service Commission is affirmed, all costs to be paid by the appellee." In Application No. 9425, c. B. &amp; Q. for authority to waive collection of undercharges and make refund In connection with shipments of gravel from Ashland to Waverly by the Abel Construction Company, I have this to say: The State Railway Commission has no jurisdiction to grant, by a retroactive order, the prayer of the application of what the carrier may have intended in filing its original application, No. 9008. In has no power to correct the mistakes of a carrier in filing a rate application. It may, however, correct its own errors in certain cases. This seems to be such a case. If the Commission actually found, at the time of the hearing upon the original application, that the rate from Linoma to Ashland should have been forty cents and failed, through its oversight, to enter an order properly expressing its finding, the Commission may now correct its record by supplying the omitted order. The Commission may also consider the reasonableness of the rate. The proposed order Includes a finding of unreasonableness. No founda - tion, however, appears to exist for such, a finding. There is neither a sufficient application, nor does it appear that any evidence was offered to support it. If this matter is to be determined upon the reasonable? ness of the rate, there should be proper application and a regular hearing before permission is given as requested. The Commission should follow one or the other of the suggested courses. I have considered your question, verbally submitted, and have this to say: The question Is: "May a private individual construct an electric transmission line along a public highway In front of another landowner's property, such property being outside of Incorporated cities and villages, in order to reach a municipal lighting plant?" A diligent search of the statutes fails to reveal any provision grant - ing such authority. The conclusion, therefore, is that you do not have that authority. The village of Firth, to which you propose building a line, has authority to extend its service outside the city limits, but no individual has the right to build a line. In order to connect with the city plant; in other words, the village has the right so to use the high - ways but an individual has not. </seg>
            <seg id="p193">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION Several claims have been presented to the State Railway Commis - sion recently, which claims were filed more than two years after their accrual. Some relate to reparations and some to overcharges. All are less than four years old. The question is: "Has the Nebraska State Railway Commission jurisdiction to hear and determine such claims?" We are not concerned at present with the distinction between claims for reparation and claims founded on overcharges. It will be assumed for the present, but without expressing any opinion thereon, that the Commission has jurisdiction of claims based on overcharges. In considering this subject the distinction between judicial power and legislative power must be kept constantly in mind. The Supreme Court of the United States in Baer Bros. Mercantile Company v. Denver &amp; R. G. R. R. Co., 233 U. S. 479, said (486-487) : "1. That the two subjects ' of reparation and rates may be dealt with in one order is undoubtedly true. Texas &amp; P. R. Co. v. Abilene Cotton Oil Co., 204 U. S. 446, 51 L. ed. 561, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 350, 9 Ann. Cas. 1075; Robinson v. Baltimore &amp; O. R. Co., 222 U. S. 509, 56 L. ed. 289, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 114. But awarding repara - tion for the past and fixing rates for the future involve the determin - ation of matters essentially different. One is in its nature private and the other public. One Is made by the Commission In Its quasi judicial capacity to measure past injuries sustained by a private shipper; the other, in its quasi legislative capacity, to prevent future injury to the public. But testimony showing the unreason - ableness of a past rate may also furnish information on which to fix a reasonable future rate, and both subjects can be, and often are, disposed of by the same order. This, however, is not necessarily so. Indeed, under the original commerce act, the two matters could not possibly be combined In a single order lor the reason that, while at that time the Commission could order thu carrier to desist from unreasonable practices and award damages, it could not fix rates. This brought about an anomalous state of affairs. For if the shipper obtained his order of reparation be - cause of unreasonable charges which the railroad company was ordered to discontinue, a slightly different, but still unreasonable, - rate might be put in for the future, which the shipper had to i.ay and again institute proceedings for reparation. 24 Stat, at L. 384, Par. 15, chap. 104, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3165." The case just quoted from has been frequently cited. Louisville &amp; Nashville R. R. Co. v. Sloss-Sheffield S..&amp; I. Co., 269 U. S. 217. In Brady v. I. C. C, 43 Fed. 2d, 847, It is said (850-851) : "Reparation orders were provided for in the original Inter - state Commerce Act and were to be enforce'd by application to the Circuit Courts of the United States. 24 Stat. 379, 384. By the Act of March 2, 1889, provision was made that actions to enforce them should be tried at law before a jury. 25 Stat. 855, 859.

            <seg id="p194">TWENTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT order was granted by that act because then, for the first time, the rate-making power was conferred upon the Commission, and then disobedience of its orders was first made punishable. U. S. v. Los Angeles &amp; Salt Lake Railroad, 273 U. S. 299, 309, 47 S. Ct. 413, 71 L. Ed. 651. "Amending section 15 of the Interstate Commerce Act, the Act June 29, 1906, provided that the Commission should determine just and reasonable maximum rates and just, fair, and reasonable practices with respect to transportation and issue orders to car - riers with respect thereto, and that all orders of the Commission, except orders for the payment of money, should take effect within such reasonable time, not less than thirty days, as might be pre - scribed by the Commission, unless same should be suspended or set aside by the Commission or by a court of competent jurisdic - tion. 34 Stat. 589, Par. 4 (49 USCA Par. 15). By the amendment of section 16 (34 Stat. 590, Par. '5— 49 USCA Par. 16—), it drew a clear distinction between reparation orders and other orders of the Commission, by providing for suit in the Circuit Courts to collect damages in the case of reparation orders not complied with, and for application to a court ot equity for the enforcement of other orders. Following this was the provision for suits to enjoin, set aside, annul, or suspend orders of the Commission; and when all of these provisions are considered together, we think it clear that the jurisdiction thus conferred was intended to relate to quasi legislative orders, in which the public at large are Interested, dis - obedience of which is made punishable, and the suspension of which is expressly provided for by section 15 of the act, and not to reparation orders which affect only the rights of private indi - viduals, have no binding force and do not subject anyone to pun - ishment for disobedience. For distinction between the two kinds of orders, see Baer Bros. v. Denver, etc., R. Co., 233 U. S. 479. 34 S. Ct 641, 58 L. Ed. 1055." In Isthmian S. S. Co. v. United States, 63 Fed. 2d, 251, Baer Bros. Mercantile Co. v. Denver &amp; R. G. R. R. Co., supra, is quoted extensively. In Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co. v, Arizona Grocery Co., 49 Fed. 2d, 663, the court said (668) : "Let It be granted that the Commission In awarding repara - tions acted judicially, as has been so often said (Baer Bros Mer - cantile Co. v. Denver &amp; R. G. R. R. Co., 233 U. S. 479, 34 S. Ct 641, 58 L. Ed. 1055; Great N. Ry. Co. v. Merchants* Elevator Co., 259 U. S. 285, 291, 42 S. Ct. 477, 66 L. Ed. 943); let it be granted, also, that in fixing a reasonable rate for past transactions as a basis for its award of reparations it also acted judicially, as has also sometimes been said (Great No. Ry. v. Merchants Elevator Co., supra)." The decision was affirmed, Arizona Grocery Co. v. Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co., by the United States Supreme Court January 4, 1932. In Great Northern R. Co. v. Merchants Elevator Co., 259 U. S. 285, it was said (291) : "To determine what rate, rule, or practice shall he deemed reasonable for the future is a legislative or administrative tunc- </seg>
            <seg id="p195">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION tion. . To determine whether a shipper has in the past been wronged by the exaction of an unreasonable or discriminatory rate is a judicial function." The authorities have been cited in order that it may be clear that legislative and judicial functions are separate and distinct although they may be exercised by the same body and under the same forms of pro - cedure. Granting reparation and requiring refunding of overcharges are purely judicial. While Section 20 of Article IV of the Constitution, granting to the State Railway Commission the power to. regulate the rates, service and general control ot common carriers, confers certain judicial power upon the Commission, (Hooper Telephone Company v. Nebraska Telephone Company, 96 Neb. 245), it did not confer jurisdiction, that is, the power to hear and determine causes, as ordinarily meant with reference to courts, and as involved in granting reparation and requiring refunding of overcharges. In order to determine the present question, reference should be made to the constitutional provisions relating to the judicial power. Sec. tion 1 of Article V of the Constitution is as follows : "The judicial power of the state shall be vested In a supreme court, district courts, county courts, justices of the peace, and such other courts inferior to the supreme court as may be created by law; but other courts may be substituted by law /of justices of the peace within such districts, and with such additional civil and criminal jurisdiction, as may be provided by law." If such power is possessed by the Commission, it is, therefore, due to some specific act of the legislature. No such provision was found in the law of this state until the legislature passed the act of 1921. Section 75-203, C. S. 1929, has been referred to as conferring such jurisdiction, but there is not the remotest reference In that section to the power to hear and determine a cause. That section, at most, pur - ports only to confer legislative power and to provide for the infliction of penalties. The fact that the legislature of 1921 deemed it necessary to grant the State Railway Commission specific power to hear and determine claims for reparation, and perhaps for overcharges, is a clear legislative Interpretation ot the prior state of the law. It was a determination that there was no provision of law already existing covering the subject The act of 1921, Section 75-510, C. S. 1929. is as follows: "That if, after hearing on a complaint under sections 6126, 6127, 6128, 6129 or sections 6137, 6138, 6139, 6140, revised statutes of Nebraska for 1913, (75-501 to 75-504, 75-506 to 75-509), the Ne - braska state railway commission shall determine that any party complainant has on and after the taking effect of this Act and </seg>
            <seg id="p196">TWENTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT within two years next preceding the filing of the said complaint, paid unjust or unreasonable rates or charges to any defendant railroad or express company in this state on intrastate traffic or has on and after the taking effect of this act and within two years next preceding the filing of the said complaint suffered damages by reason of the maintaining, publishing, demanding, charging, receiving or retaining by such carrier of any rate or rates, charges, rules, regulations, services or practices on Intrastate traffic which are found by the commission to be unjust, unreasonable, unjustly discriminatory, unduly preferential or otherwise unlawful, the com - mission shall make an order directing the railroad or express com - pany to pay to the complainant the sum to which he Is entitled on or before a day named. (1921 p. 820; C. S. 1922, 5500)." If the Commission has power to act on claims more than two years old, it is by virtue of the section just above quoted. Without that section, the Commission has no power either to grant reparations or to make de - cisions requiring refunding of overcharges. (As stated above, no opinion is here expressed as to overcharges.) Section 75-510 consists of two parts. The first relates to unjust and unreasonable rates or charges paid within two years next preceding the filing of the complaint; the second relates to damages suffered within two years next preceding the filing of- the complaint The two parts overlap each other somewhat but both depend upon the filing of the complaint within two years. It will be observed that the section is all comprised within one sentence, and that the time limit is specified as a condition precedent to jurisdiction rather than as a period of limitation. In our view, claims for overcharges are not limited to a two-year period. The next section, 75-511, C. S. 1929, provides that if the order of the Commission is not compiled with within the time limited in the order, suit may be filed thereon in the district court, and that in such suit the findings and order of the Commission shall be prima facie evi - dence of the facts therein . stated. This also demonstrated the judicial character of the proceeding before the State Railway Commission. It is therefore the opinion of this department that the time limit specified in the statute is jurisdictional and that the Railway Commission cannot lawfully entertain a claim either for reparation or for overcharges more than two years after its accrual. This matter is called to the attention of the Commission at this time for the reason that if determination on the claims presented Is delayed, particularly if there should be appeals to the Supreme Court, the claim - ants might lose their rights by reason of the expiration of their time for bringing suit under the general statute of limitations. Some of the claims seem to be just and valid, and this opinion Is given at this </seg>
            <seg id="p197">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION time in order that they may not be unduly delayed and thereby the claimants lose the right of prosecuting them In the proper tribunals. Pursuant to your request of last evening, I have examined the ap - plication, opinion and findings and order in Application No. 9601, as well as the supersedeas bond tendered by Publix Cars in its intended appeal from the order entered by the Commission In said application. That part of the statute (Sec. 75-505, C. S. 1929), relating to appeal bonds in appeals from the State Railway Commission to the Supreme Court, reading as follows: "* • * in no case shall the -filing of a supersedeas bond sus - - pend the putting In force or operation of any decision, regulation, rate, schedule or order of the commission of any nature whatso - ever, unless such supersedeas bond is conditioned and in sufficient amount, to be approved by the commission, to insure the prompt refunding, by the appealing common carrier to the parties en - titled thereto, of all charges which such common carrier may col - lect or receive pending the appeal in excess of those fixed or au - thorized by the final decision in the cause by the supreme court." is so obscure and uncertain as to be impossible of exact interpretation. It seems to refer to cases where definite rights of the parties are actually determined. In the present instance, the action of the Commission is general. The order is confined to the formulation of certain general rules for the operation of taxicabs. No determination is made as to whether or not Publix Cars may operate its cabs on the streets of Omaha. In other words, Application No. 9601 has resulted only In legislative action. It is therefore not competent for the Commission to accept a supersedeas bond in appeal. To do so would mean that the Commission, after legis - lating, had authorized the suspension of its enactment. It is not be - lieved that the Supreme Court would entertain an appeal from the order in this proceeding any more than it would consider an appeal from the legislature itself. There are several methods by which the validity of the order may be judicially tested, as any act of the legislature may be tested. The proposed appeal, however, is not one of them. it is the opinion of this department that the bond tendered should not be approved as a supersedeas bond. If Publix Cars still desires to appeal, It is sugested that a cost bond be approved and transcript fur - nished as provided by law. The engineering department of the State Railway Commission has submitted this question: "May a public service corporation issue its </seg>
            <seg id="p198">TWENTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT promissory note in renewal of a prior note, the combined periods covered by the two notes being in excess of twelve months?" In several instances the annual reports made by public' service cor - porations to the Commission show that such notes are being issued. For example, one such note originally given for twelve months has been renewed ten times, each renewal being for twelve months. The statute relating to this matter, Section 75-1201, C. S. 1929, is, in part, as follows: "Such common carrier or public service corporation may issue notes for proper corporate purposes and not in violation of any provisions of law, payable at periods of not more than twelve (12) months without such consent; but no such notes shall, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, be refunded by any issue of such stock or bonds, or by any evidence ot indebtedness run - ning more than twelve months without the consent of the said commission • • *." The question has never been before the Supreme Court of this state. Such authorities as have been- found do not discuss the subject satis - factorily. A few states have had the foresight to provide specifically against renewal of such obligations without permission. Our statute does not contain such a provision. It is the opinion of this department that a note for twelve months may be renewed without permission of the State Railway Commission if the original note was made for proper corporate purposes and not in violation of any law. To be valid it must be given in good faith. A note issued without permission for twelve months in renewal of a similar note, there being no probability that it can be paid -when due and no provision made for its retirement, is merely a colorable device to evade the law. Corporations having such notes outstanding should be compelled to re - tire them. This Is In answer to your oral Inquiry of yesterday regarding the proposed order In Application No. 9831. The question involved Is whether or not the State Railway Commission may make a retroactive order. The essential facts are these: The rate on sand and gravel from the Lyman-Richey pit 6.17 miles west of Fremont to Beemer was 4 cents up to July 16, 1931. On July 9, 1931, (erroneously stated in the proposed order as May 13, 1931) an application was made by the Chicago and North Western Railway, being Application No. 9076, to reduce the rate to 3.5 cents. The application was granted on July 15, 1931, effective July 16, 1931. Shipments from the pit to Beemer were made July 6th to 15th, inclusive, 1931, at the 4 cent rate. The present Application No. 9831, filed September 13, 1932, of the Chi - cago and North Western is for permission to return to the Lyman- </seg>
            <seg id="p199">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION i Rlchey Company $719.62 which is a difference between the 4 cent rate and the 3.6 cent rate on the shipments mentioned. It will be observed that the shipments began three days before the application in No. 9076 was filed. A copy of the order in No. 9076 was sent to the applicant on August 5, 1931. On July 23, 1931, Mr. H. F. Curtis of the Lyman-Richey Company addressed a letter to the State Railway Commission as follows: "Omaha, Nebraska, July 23, 1931 "Nebraska State Railway Commission Lincoln, Nebraska. Application No. 9076 "Gentlemen: In authorizing C. &amp; N. W. to publish the reduced rates to Beemer and other stations, we will be pleased if you will direct them to make same effective July 9. Yours very truly, (Signed) H. F. Curtis." Apparently it was not the thought of any one that shipments earlier than the filing in Application No. 9076 would be affected by the order entered therein. The answer to your question must be the same as that heretofore given in similar cases. The State Railway Commission has no power to make retroactive orders except in the unusual instances where nunc pro tunc orders are proper and then only the same restric - tions that the law imposes on the district courts. The only method of granting reparation is under Sections 75-510 and 76-511, C. S. 1929. That requires a hearing and a finding of unreasonableness of the pre-existing rates. No such finding appears in the proposed order In No. 9831. It is the understanding, based on the testimony offered in many of these emergency sand and gravel applications, that the emergency rates are not considered reasonable but are offered by the carriers solely for the purpose of meeting competition. It is therefore the opinion ot this department that the proposed order in Application No. 9831 should not be granted and that the application should be dismissed. Your letter of October 7th duly received. You ask the following question: "If a regular passenger train of five cars or less is required to handle enough freight cars so that the total number of pas - senger and freight cars is six cars or more, does such a train ■come within the provisions of Section 74 519, Complied Statutes for 1929? That is, does six or more freight and passenger cars together in the same passenger train, require two orakemen, or one brakeman and one flagman?" The statute relating to this subject is as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p200">TWENTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT "It shall be unlawful for any railroad company doing business in the state of Nebraska to operate or run over its road or any part thereof, or suffer or permit to be run over its road or any part thereof, outside of the yard limits, any passenger, mall or express train carrying passengers, whose regular equipment con - sists of more than five cars, with a crew, consisting of less than one engineer, one fireman, one conductor, one brakeman and one flagman; and further provided, passenger trains whose regular equip - ment consists of five cars or less, may be operated with a crew consisting of one engineer, one fireman, one conductor and one brakeman or flagman." It is the opinion of this department that the train being carded as a passenger train, retains its character as such under the circumstances you stated, and if its regular equipment consists of more than five cars, it must have a crew consisting of an engineer, a conductor, one brake - man and one flagman. It will be observed that the statute says "regular equipment". A single instance of such operation as you describe would probably not be held to be a violation, but if it is made a practice it would constitute a violation. Your favor of the 11th duly received upon my return to the office on October 15th. Your Inquiry Is as follows: "We are handing you herewith copy of Missouri Pacific Rail - road Company's proposed tariff. Supplement 17 to circular con - taining rules and regulations governing the transportation of freight between stations on the Missouri Pacific in Nebraska. We wish to call your attention to Item No. 133-B on page 4 thereof. "The Missouri Pacific Railroad, alleging that it is for the sake of uniformity, has made application to apply Section 133-B to Ne - braska intrastate traffic. Objection has been made that this rule is contrary to Section 74-820 to 74-823, inclusive, of the statutes of Nebraska. "Will you kindly advise us at your earliest convenience whether or not, In your opinion, such is the case?" Paragraph (a) of the proposed rule Is as follows: "When property now or hereafter in the carrier's possession shall have been held for not less than fifteen days awaiting pay - ment of tariff charges or acceptance or disposition instructions under circumstances which impose upon the owner, shipper or consignee the duty of paying such charges or giving such disposi - tion (including acceptance by steamship' lines at ports of export), and there is no provision in the contract of shipment respecting sale of unclaimed freight, said property may be disposed of by the carrier in the following manner: (1) Non-perishable property may be sold at public sale upon notice having first been mailed, sent or given not less than twenty days prior to the date of sale to all parties shown by the billing to be interested therein whose ad - dresses are shown or known by the carrier's agent at point of sale, which notice shall describe the shipment, shall specify the time and place of the proposed sale, and shall state that- the </seg>

(2) Perishable property may be sold at private or public sale upon such notice or attempted notification to those known by the carrier's agent at place of sale or appearing from the billing to be interested, as the condition of the shipment and the necessity for prompt sale shall, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, warrant." The statutes of Nebraska relating to this subject are as follows: "74-821. If any property not perishable in its nature shall be permitted to remain in the possession of any railroad company, unclaimed or refused, for a period of sixty days, with the lawful charges thereon due and unpaid, such railroad company may pro - ceed to sell the same at public auction at Its freight station at the destination of the shipment, after mailing notice by United States mall of the amount of the charges to the consignor and consignee, if their whereabouts are known, or if their whereabouts be unknown, then to the consignor at the originating point of the shipment and to the consignee at the destination of the shipment and in addition thereto posting, at its freight station, in a con - spicuous place accessible to the public, for a period of ten days after the mailing of such notice, a notice of the time and place Of the proposed sale and a description of the property to be sold, it known, and if not a description of the package in which it is contained, the amount of charges thereon and the name of the consignee and consignor thereof: Provided, however, if there be no satisfactory bid at said auction sale, the railroad company may remove the property to some other city of not less than five thou - sand inhabitants within the state and there proceed to sell the same at public auction after giving additional notice by mailing and posting as hereinbefore provided. "74-822. Fruit, fresh fish, oysters, game and other perishable property, after having been retained for twenty-four hours after notice to consignee, If he be known, may be sold, either at pub - lic or private sale In the discretion of the railroad company, for the highest price that the same will bring. "74-823. After the lawful charges of the railroad company for transportation and storage for the period of compulsory retention shall be deducted from the proceeds of the sale, the overplus, If any, shall be held by the railroad company, subject to the order of the owner, and, at any time within twelve months after such sale, upon the demand of the owner, the railroad company shall pay the same to him." The proposed rule attempts to change the time of notice both with respect to perishable and to non-perishable property and to change the conditions and manner of sale. It is the opinion of this department that the provisions ot the stat - ute are mandatory; that the proposed rule is contrary to the stat - utes in the respects specified, as well as otherwise, and that the applica - tion should be denied. ■ </seg>
