S inimal Pathology and Hygun "!■ Qm of the most important diseases of farm animals is tuberculosis, and. while it inflicts tin* most damage to cattle and ■wine, its amurcaee among poultry is also sufficiently common in Nebraska to require the attention of all who are interested in the raising anil keeping of chickens and turkeys. It is especially among those kinds of fowl that the disease is most frequently found. It i^ rarely seen in ducks and geese, but THE CAUSE The omk of tuberculosis of all animals is the tubercle wcillu-: and this is also the case in bird-. There are, however, •ertain variety differences between the avian bacillus and the &lt;&gt;ne- which produce the disease in man, cattle and swine. Those difference- manifest themselves principally in the disease - producing qnalittefl of the germs with which we are concerned. It i- very difficult, if not impossible in most cases, for manimal&gt; mtract tuberculosis from birds, while the tubercle bacilli of man and bovine origin will not produce the disease in fowl - a typical manner. Furthermore there are also certain differ- manner the various organisms grow in the lat&gt;or:i tory and by which it is often possible to distinguish them. Cros-infection- have, however, been observed, and it would be folly to disregard this fact when we are confronted with the disease. The bacillu- of bird tuberculosis is quite resistant to adverse influences. It remained alive in the soil of infected poultry yards for long periods after the diseased birds were removed and the germ is only killed slowly by the ordinary disinfectants. The germ does not multiply outside of the body of the infected animal, and hence we may be quite certain that one MM of fowl tuberculosis alway- has its origin in the direct or indirect contact with an infected bird. THE TRANSMISSION This often takes place when newly-purchased birds are introduced into a healthy flock or when the offal of poultry produced for the table is so disposed of that healthy fowls have access to it. Tn addition, it is possible that tuberculosis may \\c carried to a healthy flock by such flying birds as pigeons and sparrow-, both of those species being quite sus - ceptible to the disease. utbrt'ukx among pigeons have Ix-en described. </seg>

If we inject too deeply no reaction occurs in even a diseased bird, and when we inject too superficially the fluid is apt to hurst thru the epidermis, and this also would render a reaction impossible. As a rule one succeeds better with attempting the injection into the wattle, which has the further ad vantage that in awe of positive reaction the latter is niorv clearly marked. The quantity of tuberculin to be injected is usually de ermined by the tissues themselves; about so much can be jected, but no more. A small quantity in a positive case jives as good a reaction as a larger one. The injected birds re to be examined for results _'4. M and 72 hours after the ntroduction of the tuberculin.

The test i - airly accurate, especially so in the hands of one who has cquired skill in applying it. Yet. like in all tubercqjin test-. will occasionally happen that an affected animal fails to react. THE PREVENTION The prevention of avian tuberculosis i&gt; above all baaed upon the fact that the disease primarily depends on the intro duction into birds or flock of the tubercle bacillus and that this organism almost exclusively is transported from place to place by infected birds or their parts. tWhen we are reasonably certain that a flock is free from e disease, prevention is in the first place dependent on the elusion of infected fowls from the premises. This may he me either by procuring new stock from flocks known to be ih&gt; from tuberculosis or by subjecting the new birds to the bereulin test as described above. A further source of infection to be kept in mind is con neoted with the use of the undrawn fowls of unknown origin for table use. On our farms this is. of course, not a very i-ommon practice, but in our cities and villages this danger i«s by no means negligible. </seg>
            <seg id="p007">Tl HOKTUIM IN I'm i.tiiy ■ Even in the cast- in which the fowls are bought in a drawn condition, the finding of a liver with tuberculous nodules is usually sufficient to consign that part, if not the whole carcass, to the garbage can or pile where healthy birds may find it anil consume it. On account of this danger ;ill offal, no matter what its condition, should he destroyed by burning in stove or furnace. To what extent flying bird&gt; visiting poultry yards are a means of transmission we do not know. Promblj it is a factor in exceptional cases only, yet it seems wise to keep its |&gt;ossibility in mind, especially in connection with pigeons. Altho the tuberculosis germ has been found in eggs, it is probable that eggs purchased for hatching do not constitute a very potent source of danger. The common occurrence of tuberculosis in cattle and swine naturally bring- up the question in how far the offal of such animals und for poultry feed may be an element of danger. We know that it is a very difficult thing to transmit mammalian tabwodHM U&gt; fowls, yet we believe that a little caution in this resj&gt;ect will not be entirely thrown away. Poultry growers find meat and Innie scraps an excellent feed and it appears to be a good practice to boil this material before feeding. This will absolutely remove all infection danger. While it is not difficult to keep a healthy flock free from infection, the eradication of tuberculosis from an infected flock is by no means an easy matter, if it is to be done in a con - servative manner. The management of a diseased flock may be undertaken along three distinct lines. In the first place we may proceed in a radical manner and kill off the entire flock, clean and disinfect yards, houses, eating and drinking utensils and restock with healthy poultry, after a considerable period. In small flocks or in those not having a particular breeding value, this method is by no means always objectionable and may be even the most economical one. The birds sacrificed are not a total loss because the ones not diseased or only slightly so can be used for table purposes. In summer the carcasses can be preserved by canning, while in winter it is often possible to keep them in frozen condition until wanted for the table. When it is deemed necessary to preserve the flock as much as possible, the diseased and healthy birds may be separated by means of the tuberculin test. All birds showing a positive or even a doubtful reaction should, of course, be sacrificed. The healthy birds should be taken to non-contaminated quarters and the premises, etc.. subjected to a thoro cleaning and dis - infection. If the older birds be likewise eliminated this method </seg>
