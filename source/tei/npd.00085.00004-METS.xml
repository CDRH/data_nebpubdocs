            <seg id="p004">LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL To His Excellency, R. L. Cochran, Governor of Nebraska: I have the honor to submit herewith the official report of the Safety Division and Nebraska State Employment Service of the Department of Labor, for the years 1937 and 1938. The Unemployment Compensation Law requires an annual report not: later than February 1. Therefore, the administration and operation of the Unemployment Compensation Division will be reported separately at a later date. Respectfully yours, V. B. Kinney, Commissioner of Labor. </seg>
            <seg id="p005">To His Excellency, Governor R. L. Cochran, Capitol Building, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Governor: There has been a great deal of progress made in the functions of the Department of Labor during your term as Governor and more especially during the years of 1937 and 1938. The establishment by Nebraska of a bureau of labor and industrial statistics (the forerunner of the present department of labor) in 1887 was distinctly in keeping with the trend of the times. The United States Bureau of Labor had been established in 1884. The lowa bureau, the fourteenth to be established in the United States, was also created in 1884. The Kansas bureau was established in 1885. Nebraska was one of six states to provide for labor bureaus in 1887. The Knights of Labor, at their height in 1886, were favorable to the establishment of such bureaus and supported the movement in Nebraska. Early History The labor bureau act of 1887 made the governor the chief labor commissioner and authorized him to appoint a deputy commission of labor, who should have all the power of the commissioner. Because of the limited powers granted by the act, the commissioner did not become a real factor in the administration of the labor laws. This was especially true because inspections were merely to be reported to the local prosecuting authorities, who were under no special obliga - tion to act. Moreover, insufficient appropriations prevented proper in - spections and made effective administration impossible. Until the re - organization of the bureau in 1919, the commissioner of labor was not an important factor in the administration of the labor laws of the state. For the first thirty years of its existence the bureau of labor did very little to assist the wage earners, its energies being absorbed in publicity. The legislative session of 1917 marks a turning point in the de - velopment of the department. The legislature of 1919 and 1935 also enacted laws greatly improving the machinery for administering the labor laws of Nebraska. In 1917, the commissioner of labor was made the compensation commissioner and was given many new powers to properly administer that law. The legislation of 1919 replaced the bureau of labor and industrial statistics with the department of labor. The new agency was given additional powers at that time. In 1935 the compensation court was established to exercise complete jurisdiction 5 </seg>
            <seg id="p006">over the compensation law. This left the department of labor free to give more adequate attention to the other labor laws. A division of em - ployment and a division of unemployment compensation were created in the department in 1937 to administer the unemployment compensa - tion law, passed at that time. Appropriations, while still inadequate, were increased after 1917. Moreover, between 1919 and 1937 the labor department gave little attention to publicity but increased its emphasis upon labor law administration, especially upon the compensation law until 1935. The department of labor had been subject to political manipulation which had undermined its efficiency. The chief form of this interfer - ence was in the appointment of the labor commissioner and his staff. With each change in administration or at least with each change in parties an inexperienced commissioner and staff were placed in charge of the department. This usually meant disorganization and inefficiency while the new staff was becoming familiar with its duties. Despite this handicap in the selection of personnel, the labor commissioners have usually been men, who by training and experience were sympathetic with labor and tried to serve the best interests of the working group. The adequacies of appropriations probably determine the efficiency of an administrative agency more completely than does the organization of the department or the powers granted to it. Before 1917 the appro - priations to the Nebraska labor department were very meager. After the enactment of the code law in 1919, appropriations were more sub - stantial. In all cases, however, the amounts were small compared with the total appropriations. The usual appropriations for the depart - ment of labor represents less than one one-thousandth of the total state budget. Surely no one would question the proposal that the industrial workers of the state contribute more than one one-thousandth to the well-being of the state, and that such small appropriations are definitely inadequate. With the establishments of the compensation court in 1935, the appropriations for all labor law administration have been materially increased. However, in the light of the task to be performed, substantial appropriations are necessary to assure the protection to which the workers are entitled under the labor laws. The statute creating the department of labor vests in the depart - ment the general powers of fostering and promoting the welfare of the wage earner, the collection and publication of statistics relating to all aspects of the labor problem, and a number of other activities designed to improve the conditions of labor through research, investigation, and public education. The laws entrusted to the labor department for ad - ministration are the laws relating to employment regulations, child labor, health and safety, and employment agencies. The employment regulations include the female labor law and other laws relating to em - ployment conditions. The department is also in charge of public employ - ment offices and the unemployment compensation law. 6 </seg>
            <seg id="p007">The administrative powers of the department include the duty of prescribing blanks and forms for reporting, rule making, inspection, and other powers' designed to enable the department to enforce the laws assigned to it. The rule making power has been most completely de - veloped in connection with the establishment of safety codes. This is one of the most important work. Among the activities of the department, one function has been con - spicuously lacking in the past. This is the analysis of statistics and the preparation of studies dealing with labor conditions in the state. The laws give the department adequate authority to make such statistical compilation and research studies. The enactment of the Unemployment Compensation Law and the providing of funds by the Social Security Board, has made it possible to establish a joint division of statistics and research of the Unemployment Compensation Division and the Nebraska State Employment Service which will in time furnish adequate statistics on labor and industrial problems in the State. Power to Adopt Codes 48-412 of the compiled Statutes of Nebraska provided that "The Department of Labor is directed and empowered to formulate, adopt, publish, and enforce such safety codes, orders, rules and standards as it deems necessary, in order that all employments and places of employ - ment shall be in all respects, so constructed, equipped, arranged, oper - ated and maintained as to provide reasonable and adequate protection to the lives, health and safety of all persons employed therein and fre - quenting the same, as the nature of the employment will reasonably permit. Such Codes as may be adopted shall be subject to modification, amendment or repeal at any time, in the discretion of the Department." This law empowers the Labor Department to provide codes and ade - quate protection in employment, provided adequate appropriations are made by the legislature or authority vested in the Department to levy fees for inspection of boilers, elevators and the like. On August 4, 1937, the Commissioner of Labor called a meeting of all those who were connected or were interested in the elevator industry within the State of Nebraska, for the purpose of writing a safety elevator code. This meeting was largely attended and a set of safety rules governing this industry was compiled. On October 20, 1937, the Commissioner of Labor called a meeting of all persons interested in the cleaning and dyeing industry for the purpose of revising the cleaning and dyeing code. Safety rules and regulations were written and compiled. Both codes were submitted to the Governor and the Labor Commis - sioner for their approval and are now part of the safety 'codes of the Department of Labor. 7 </seg>
            <seg id="p008">Beneficial to all concerned has been the fine cooperation with the department of the safety engineers of the insurance companies, the safety officers in large concerns, and the inspection forces of the Ne - braska municipalities. At all times these groups have exchanged their technical knowledge with the Inspectors of the department. The Department of Labor has had one of its inspectors assigned to the construction work going on along the Missouri river. There are approximately 14 different contractors working along the Nebraska shore from South Sioux City to Rulo, Nebraska. The department has had the full cooperation of the War Department and the contractors working on the Missouri river. The department has done much to safe - guard their health and reduce the hazards of this work, and because of the efforts put forth, the files of the Compensation Court show a reduction in the number of accidents occurring along the Missouri River. From time to time the Commissioner of Labor has assigned one of the inspectors to the various hydro-electric projects now being con - structed in the State of Nebraska, and from the activity of this in - spection as to safety on these projects there has been a marked reduction to the number of accidents occurring. The inspector assigned has held numerous meetings with the laborers on these projects and have given them safety instructions which has done much to make the laborer safety conscience. Every large institution in the State of Nebraska has been inspected by one of the inspectors in the Department of Labor, for hazards. Recommendations have been made where hazards exist and they have been corrected. 8 </seg>
            <seg id="p009">Child Labor Law There has been rigid enforcement of the child labor law and the female labor law. All complaints and violations of the female labor law have been adjusted and the department has brought during the biennium three actions against employers for the violation of this law and in each case has secured a conviction. Nebraska is fortunate in that it has no children employed in any so-called hazardous occupations or in "sweat shops." The tabulation of the number of children employed between the ages of 14 and 16 is submitted herewith. 1937 Source of Number of Certificates Certificates Places of Employment and School — Status Age Age Home Sales Mfg.

In previous years there has been very little activity in the way of enforcement of the provisions of this law and the Commissioner of Labor has in the past merely acted as a collecting agency to collect the license fee prescribed by the provisions of this law. But during the bienmum the Commissioner of Labor has asked the Attorney General 10 </seg>
            <seg id="p011">for an opinion as to whether or not he had the right to prescribe the form of contracts to be used by private employment agencies licensed under the laws of Nebraska. Under date of April 14, 1938, the Attorney General gave the Commissioner of Labor a written opinion to the effect that he had a right to prescribe the form of contract to be used by pri - vate employment agencies licensed under the laws of the State of Ne - braska. As a result, the form of contract being used by these private agencies has been greatly modified. Merit System Establishment of th e Nebraska State Employment Service and the Unemployment Compensation Division necessitated the inauguration of the merit system for appointment of employees of these two units of the State Labor Department. All employees of these divisions, with the exception of the director &#132; U l n , em . ployment Compensation, hold their jobs after appointment from eligible lists. The State law creating the employment service did not provide for the merit system. However, rules and regulations of the United States Employment Service made it necessary, under the Wagner-Peyser Act for the State to agree to the merit system in order to qualify for co - operation as provided by the law. All employees in the Nebraska State Employment Service (including the director) have been chosen from e.igible lists. Examinations for the creation of eligible lists have been held twice in Nebraska since the passage of the original employment service bill. These examinations have been conducted under the supervision of the United States Employment Service. All persons connected with conducting the examinations, with the exception of the supervisor, have been provided by the United States Employment Service from Wash - ington, D. C. The Nebraska Unemployment Compensation Law provides that ap - pointments, with the exception of the director, shall be made under the merit system and that "the commissioner shall classify positions under this Act and shall establish salary schedules and minimum personnel standards for the positions so classified. He shall provide for the holding of examinations to determine the qualifications of applicants for the positions so classified, and, except for temporary appointments of not to exceed six months in duration, such personnel shall be appointed on the basis of efficiency and fitness as determined in such examinations. No person who is an officer or committee member of any political party organization or who holds or is a candidate for any public office shall be appointed or employed under this Act. The Commissioner shall 11 </seg>
            <seg id="p012">establish and enforce fair and reasonable regulations for appointments, promotions and demotions based upon ratings of efficiency and fitness and for terminations for cause." Consequently it was necessary to select a committee to carry out the provisions of the law. The Advisory Committee on personnel, appointed by the Governor, is composed of: Chas. C. Hellmers, Lincoln; E. W. Augustine, Grand Island; and Wm. D. Lane, Omaha. &gt; This committee, which is on a permanent basis, selected Dr. E. Glenn Callen of Wesleyan University, to act as supervisor of the examinations. Examinations for all positions were held in the winter of 1937 and 1938, and eligible lists created from these examinations. 12 </seg>
            <seg id="p013">NEBRASKA STATE EMPLOYMENT SERVICE The problem of employment, from the standpoint of migration of workers attempting to find jobs, due to the fact of separation of the supply of labor and the demand for labor, together with many other problems which are caused by the size of this state and country and tbe economic and social factors involved has long perplexed this nation,. In an effort to solve these questions, in 1933 Congress enacted . a law commonly called the Wagner-Peyser Act, which, as its title explains, is "to provide for the establishment of a national employment system and for cooperation with the States in the promotion of such a system, and for other purposes." The act sets forth that "it shall be the province and duty of the bureau to promote and develop a national system of employment offices for men, women, and juniors who are legally qualified to engage in gainful occupations; to maintain a veterans' service to be devoted to securing employment for veterans; to maintain a farm placement serv - ice; to assist in establishing and maintaining systems of public employ - ment offices in the several states and the political subdivisions thereof in which there shall be located a veterans' employment service. The bureau shall also assist in coordinating the public employment offices throughout the country and in increasing their usefulness by developing and prescribing minimum standards of efficiency, assisting them in meet - ing problems peculiar to their localities, promoting uniformity in their administrative and statistical procedure, furnishing and publishing in - formation as to opportunities for employment and other information of value in the operation of the system, and maintaining a system for clearing labor between the several States." The Act appropriated "$1,500,000 for the year 1934, and $4,000,000 a year for succeeding years up to and including 1938, and thereafter such sums as Congress may deem necessary." During the 1935 session of the Nebraska legislature, due to insist - ence from Washington authorities and a strong demand from various sources in Nebraska, a law was passed creating the Nebraska State Employment Service. This law provides that the service be established in compliance with the Wagner-Peyser Act, and that it be affiliated with the United States Employment Service. It further provides that "The good faith of the state is hereby pledged to make available for the several purposes of said act, funds sufficient at least to equal the sums alloted from time to time to this state from the appropriations made by said act and to meet all conditions necessary to entitle the State of Nebraska to the benefits of said act." The 1935 session of the Nebraska legislature appropriated $33,690 for the biennial ending June 30, 1937. This was only one-half of the 13 </seg>
            <seg id="p014">amount which could have been matched by State money with that pro - vided by the Federal Government. Due to the limitation of funds at that time the Nebraska State Employment Service did not begin oper - ation until August 10, 1936. At that time approximately the eastern one-third of the State, which contains two-thirds of the population, was included as Nebraska State Employment Service territory. Offices were established at Lincoln, Omaha, Beatrice, Nebraska City, Falls City, Plattsmouth, Fremont, Columbus and Norfolk. The balance of the State remained under the National Reemploy - ment Service until January 1, 1938 when the entire State was taken over by the Nebraska State Employment Service. The 1937 session of the Nebraska legislature appropriated $70,000 for the biennial ending June 30, 1938. This amount was sufficient to match the minimum requirements as established by the United States Employment Service for compliance with the terms of the Wagner- Peyser Act. The history of public employment services in the State of Nebraska goes back to 1917 when there was established in Omaha, under the Federal Department of Labor, an employment service for the purpose of properly handling the serious employment problem which resulted from the participation of the United States in the World War. This was continued upon various bases until 1933 when the Wagner-Peyser Act was passed. At this same time there was created by an Act of Congress an emergency organization known as the National Reemployment Service. The purpose of this organization was to establish a national system of employment offices to carry out the program of a national employment system, until such time as the state employment services could be or - ganized and function effectively under the provisions of the Wagner- Peyser Act. The purpose of this organization' was to handle the labor on public works. This organization served very effectively in the State of Nebraska in the placement of persons on FERA; CWA; PWA, and construction of flood control projects along the Missouri River, under the supervision of the United States Army Engineers. The servicing of PWA projects, which include the large public power and irrigation projects over the entire state of Nebraska, together with the Missouri River projects which are still in operation has been assumed by the Nebraska State Employment Service. As stated above, the National Reemployment Service continued in existence due to lack of sufficient money for the Nebraska State Em - ployment Service to adequately assume the responsibility for the entire state. 14 </seg>
            <seg id="p015">Service Becomes Statewide On January 1, 1938 the entire state was taken over by the Nebraska State Employment Service with one director and a unified administra - tion. The emphasis from 1933 through July, 1936, had been on public placement. In August, 1936 the entire program of the Employment Service was focused on procuring jobs in private industry for unem - ployed people. Since that time this has been the primary interest around which all the activities of the Nebraska State Employment Service have been centered. An accompanying table will' show the num - ber .of private placements which have been made in the two years December 1, 1936 to November 30, 1938. ' ACTIVE FILE, APPLICATIONS.

            <seg id="p019">Farm Placement Program The Nebraska State Employment Service has constantly attempted to serve all of the people of the State of Nebraska by developing services to groups which otherwise have not been served. For this reason an ex - tensive Farm Placement Program has been developed whereby local representatives have cooperated with the local Employment Service offices in order that local labor may be made available to farmers to as great an extent as possible and unnecessary migration of labor into Nebraska has been discouraged. In the reverse it has been possible to determine, through cooperation with other state employment services, where a shortage of labor has existed and this shortage has been sup - plied through the Employment Service. This has prevented many of the workers of this state from migrating unnecessarily to areas where no jobs actually existed. To serve the same purpose a highly organized clearance system, which cooperates with all the states in the United States, has been deve'oped. Through this system skilled and unskilled workers have been sent to nearly every state. Teachers Placement Unit . As further service to the people of this state a Teacher Placement Division was created for the purpose of making available to the school districts one, large, state wide file of available teachers, and to make available to the teachers of the state who are sesking employment or advancement, an opportunity to be referred on a state wide basis. This service has been made available to every school district, city, town and rural in this state and an increasing number of them are taking ad - vantage of the service offered. This was done in cooperation with the State Department of Public Instructions and all the colleges and Universities of the state, and also the leading schools and colleges throughout the United States. Close co - ordination has been perfected between the Teacher Placement Division and those schools in the State of Nebraska where Teacher Placement Bureaus have been maintained for the service of certificated people in their institutions. This division has only been in operation since November 1, 1937 and since that time 1,340 teachers have registered; 3,898 referrals were made to school districts and 145 direct placements from referrals were made. This figure only includes the verified placement, but reports are being received of many other placements which were made so that the actual number will amount to much in excess of this figure. These placements which will last, on the average, two years or more, is a very worth while work. In addition to this all candidates have used the Service for the 19 </seg>
            <seg id="p020">purpose of having their credentials forwarded and asking that the credentials on file in this division be made available to the placement division of their own colleges. Many letters are on file from school boards, school superintendents and organizations of school men showing the appreciation they have of the Service which has been rendered. The following is quoted from a letter received from a superintendent of one of the larger schools in the state: "I want to express my appreciation for the service rendered by your department, and particularly the efficient way in which you nominated for a position in this school. "May I also compliment you on the fine set of records for in - formation concerning the candidates you recommend. This is tlv most complete evaluation of a candidate we have ever received in this office." The following is quoted from a secretary of Board of Education: "We wish to express our appreciation for your line Service." Quoted from an Association of School Men: "Motion: That a resolution of high indorsement of the Ne - braska State Employment Service, particularly teacher placement, be enacted and that *;he superintendents and principals pledge them - selves to educate their teachers and school boards to the use of this service." In accordance with the terms of the Wagner- Peyser Act a State Advisory Council, composed of equal representation from thc employers and workers and the balance representing the public at large, was ap - pointed by Governor Cochran. The membership of this Board is as follows : James L. Paxton, James G. Mothersead, Atty., Paxton Mitchell Co., Scottsbluff, Nebr. Omaha, Nebr. &#132; Harold JESPERSON, Secretary, . J. H.
