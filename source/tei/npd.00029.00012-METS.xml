            <seg id="p041">41 ADDRESS OF WELCOME. Prof. F. M. Hunter, School of Agriculture. Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen of the State Horticultural Society: A few years ago, in one of the great music halls of the great city of London, a historic pageant was going on. At this pageant the characters of history from the earliest day down to modern times were represented by human figures clad in the costumes of the time. During the progress of this pageant a couple of maiden ladies were wandering down the aisle of the great hall, catalog in hand, and stopping in front of a great figure clad in Roman armor, one of them, looking up at it, said, "Ha, ha, you must be Appyas Claudius." A stifled voice from within came in reply, "No, madam ; you a/e mistaken, I am not 'appy as Claudius,' I am un'appy as 'ell." Perhaps this expresses somewhat my feelings this afternoon in appearing before you, for I am at least as 'appy as Claudius to have the privilege of addressing this body of scientific fruit-growers. In bidding you welcome I take it I represent not only the School of Agriculture but the University itself as well, and therefore my welcome will be, in the first place, the welcome of a servant to a master, the wel - come of a steward to the lord, because you people, a body of scientific farmers, a part of the tax-paying citizens, of Nebraska, know that this in - stitution is yours, your School of Agriculture, your buildings, your grounds, your University. It is your sons and daughters who come here and make this institution their institution. I therefore give you the welcome of a custodian of the institution, and I hope that in coming back to this, your property, you may be as one who has returned from a journey into a far country to claim again his talent loaned the servant. You have been out about your business in your fruit orchards, and coming here in contact with this institution, I hope you will uot find that we have wasted the talents, or that we have wrapped them up in a napkin. I trust we will not be weighed in the balance and be found wanting. In the second place, I bring you the welcome of a comrade as well as the welcome of a servant. I bring you the welcome of a comrade be - cause you people are engaged in this same work. The University of Ne - braska is interested in the same things you are. We hold as one of our great principles, with the development of Nebraska's greatest resources, the development of citizenship. You are interested in this same thing. You are interested in the development of Nebraska's greatest resources, her agriculture and horticulture, and you are scientifically going about &amp;at business. You are interested more than anybody else in Nebraska's vital question, the development of the right kind of high-minded citizen - ship, the kind of citizenship that this country needs now more than at any time in its history. So 1 say I bring to you the welcome of a com - rade, of one who has the same type of ideals that you have as a body of men who are working towards the same thing. In bringing you this welcome it is well to consider just for a moment or two the problems that are now before us. There Is a problem that confronts us right now — the principle of in - tensive farming. You have heard it preached and have preached it your- </seg>
            <seg id="p042">42 Eves. It 1b a matter of Intensity. It Is a matter of making our farms this country do what the farms of Europe are doing- This is a prob - 1 for the present generation, and the present generation is solving it mnenn of experiment stations all over the country and by develop - nt of the American farm, not less in Nebraska than elsewhere. The sent generation Is solving it by means of the experiment station work I by scientific farms, by means of farmers' institutes, and many other ms of organised effort. There is another problem which you will please consider with me for a moment or two, a problem for the future to solve. It Is a fact that you can gain, if you are not already in the possession of it, and trust some of you are — by looking into the reports that are printed by the United States Government, of the commerce of the country, that agri - cultural, horticultural, and food stuffs, as exports of this country, have become a minor factor. One of the great problems of the future is the development of the food production at a rate corresponding to the in - crease In population of the country. That this development has not been going on as the population has increased is proved by the authority I have mentioned. Other countries in the world have become convinced that it pays to educate for the thing they are trying to do as a nation. The United States has not as a country been developing that idea thus far. We are not educating for the thing that we are trying to do as agnation. Let us take Germany as an example. It is a sad commentary upon our American pride when we point to the commerce of Germany in compari - son with our own. We are a country of about three million square miles. The whole empire of Germany could be placed in the state of Texas, and yet there would be room enough to put the great state of Illinois there beside it. Germany has a population of sixty million, in comparison with our one hundred million. Yet Germany in twenty years has beat us in foreign commerce one-half billion dollars. Those who have been there and have made a study of this thing And that the reason Germany has done that is because their school system has developed as their indus - tries have developed. She has educated her young people, her rising gen - eration, for the thing she expects to do as a nation. If you go to the city of Munich with a population of 600,000, a city like St. Louis or Baltimore. you will find thirty-eight different kinds of trade schools established. There are trade schools not only for doctors, lawyers, and professional men, but schools also for the artisan and mechanic, schools for carpen - ters, machinists, salesmen, painters, paperhangers, and even street-sweep - er*. They educate for the thine they expect to do as a nation. Let me take you for a moment to one of the little towns la France. I have a Mend up In north Nebraska who Is a scientific breeder of horses. This gentleman was called to Belgium a few years ago to consult with the Belgian government concerning some problems In horse raising. While there he visited a friend of his on hit ■mall French farm. The family consisted of five member*, and the only resource of toe home was a house and a seven-acre plot of Impoverished (?) French soil, and do you know that home is a home of affluence and luxury? This family of </seg>
            <seg id="p043">43 five had made a living and accumulated sufficient in addition to invest $10,000 in American school bonds. They inquired of my friend of the soundness of American securities of that kind, for tftey were thinking of investing more. In Nebraska we require 160 acres of land for our farming operations; there this family had 7 acres. Being'of an invest!-* gating turn of mind, my friend turned to the cause. He went to the little town school, and what do you suppose he found there? He found in the ninth grade a knowledge of agriculture that would put this scientific body to shame. He proposed a question in scientific agriculture to the ninth grade class of some forty or fifty pupils, such as might be proposed to a high school class. The class answered iu a chorus, the question was con - sidered so elementary. The whole basis of their study there had bee* agriculture. They loved it, and lived it, and made it a part of their every - day life. The school was helping them to train for the thing they ex - pected to do in life. The point that I am trying to make is that our problem of the future in Nebraska is to carry this type of training to the coming generation. This knowledge of scientific farming must be taught in every country school. Let me tell you that the school system of Nebraska today ia the same in the rural districts that it was twenty-five years ago. Our rural schools in Nebraska are having as a basis of their instruction a course of study which leads to a classical high school course, and from that to a course of the same kind in the college or University. It is a fact that about ninety-three boys out of one hundred never get beyond the eighth grade, and they never get that training for real active life in the college or University. This is what our school system amounts to now. We are confronted with the problem of carrying agricultural education to the schools of Nebraska. That is the problem that is presented to you and to me and to all who are interested in this work. That is one ol the things that we must do if we expect to keep pace with the nations who are doing it We must have in cur rural districts schools which can give real agricultural instruction, schools which are worthy of being leaders in the various communities. We must have consolidated school districts, and with these must come means and facilities for a small experiment farm for each school. It may be a little way off in the future, but that thing must come. It must come if our educational system is to survive and assume the burden that is laid upon it. We must have in our com - mon schools and in the colleges of our state a course of study which has aa its basis a knowledge of agriculture. It might not do for Lincoln or Omaha schools, but in the schools throughout Nebraska as a whole, an Interest in agriculture is above everything else. In our high schools we must not have merely a course in Latin and German and English, and history, but we must have a course in agriculture that means something. So I bid you welcome today, men of the State Horticultural Society, because we are interested in the same things you are. I bid you the wel - come of a servant ai one of the custodians of this institution of yours, and the welcome of the comrade, because we are seeking the same Ideals In our lifework. </seg>
            <seg id="p044">44 ■ RESPONSE. Pre«. W. A. Harrison. In the name of our Society, I wish to thank Professor Hunter for the vordial welcome extended to us. We appreciate the privilege of holding our meeting with you, and hope that we may cooperate even more closely in the future than we have done in the past. It has been very satisfac - tory to us to be able to work together so pleasantly. We realize the need of your help and the benefit of your experiments, and we should be of mutual benefit to each other. I When we come to look at the magnificent fruit and flower shows t we have here, we can not help but go wild with enthusiasm and want yell "hurrah for Nebraska." You do not need to go to California for rers, and if orchards are worth $1,000 per acre in Colorado and other item states, the Nebraska orchards ought to be worth $2,000 per acre. ' orchard expense is less, our market is better, our quality is better, . our fruit keeps longer. We have got the best apple country in the rid right here at our door, and it is up to us to show the public. For thing we need a larger membership in our Horticultural Society and ither thing that we need is a publicity bureau. If we could make one - t the noise that those western fellows do, we could turn eastern Ne - ska into one immense apple orchard. Now let us all get together and some team work. If every member of the Society would pledge him - ' to get one new member, we could soon have the largest society in West. We have got a Job on our hands here that is worth while. The President: The next paper will be by Mr. F. W. HofMann of Peru, Nebraska. rRITS AND DEMERITS OF GRAPE8 RECOMMENDED FOR THE MIDDLE WEST. F. W. HofMann, Peru. This paper will simply be in the nature of a review. It is often a good plan to brush up on some of the old information. If we wish to keep a tool bright and shiny we must use it. Besides, a young genera - tion is gradually taking the place of the old, and that generation must respect the Information of the older generation. It is a hard matter to bring up anything new and original in the sub - ject of grapes, yet it is considerably interesting to review some of our information. It would be well to become thoroughly acquainted with the varieties that are recommended for Nebraska. Being thoroughly ac - quainted with a variety, a grower will give it corresponding attention. Growers often are not well enough informed as to the characteristics of a variety and consequently fall short when It comes to getting ideal re - sults. Perhaps the best known grape is the Concord. No grape is more intensively grown in this country, nor is there a better example of a </seg>
            <seg id="p045">45 dominant type of our native species, which with its offspring, pure and crossed, furnishes a major per cent of the grapes grown in America. The Concord is a most cosmopolitan grape, and, due to its peculiar character - istic, it adapts itself to diverse conditions. It thrives well in variable climates. Besides taking up its abode in so many different conditions, it has a high degree of fruitfulness, as it gives large crops year in and year I This grape has a peculiar hardiness, an ability to cope with adverse litions, such as diseases and insects, a comparative earliness which es it a very superior grape. The bunches are of fair sties and the iee color up well, with an abundance of bloom. This grape is not damaged by spring freezes as badly as other grapes, for it leaves out and blossoms somewhat late in the spring. Although the Concord is a most worthy grape, it also has its demerits. To many the taste is foxy; then it lacks that richness, fineness of flavor, and aroma. Unpleasant defects in this fruit are found in the large and abundant seeds so difficult to separate from the flesh, and the tough and astringent skin Compared with the Vlnifera grapes as a shipper, the Conrord is poor Then it loses flavor after ripening. Besides the skin has an inclination to crack and the berries to shatter from the stems after harvesting. The Concord thrives best on a virgin soil, although It in quite cosmopolitan and does well on a variety of noils. I On the whole the Concord is a popular table grape and can be pro - id so cheaply that no grape ran rompete with it. It is a poor wine ie. although It is used to some degree for making red wines and a e wine as a base for champagne. The grape juice industry depends &gt;st entirely upon this variety, and during the past few years many jads of grapes have been used in the Chautauqua region in New Tork this purpose. I According to Dr. Charles E. Bessey in his contribution "The Botany ie Grape," the Concord has originated from the Northern Fox Grape .'His labrusca L. A large number of varieties have come out of the Concord, both as pure breeds and as cross-breeds. All of these seem to have inherited th characteristics of the Coneord to a high degree. According to Hedrick the seed of a wild grape was planted in the fall of 1843, by E. W. Bull o Concord, Massachusetts, from which fruit was born in 1849. The wild grape from which the seed came had been transplanted from beside a field fence to the garden in which there was at least another grape, th Catawba, and the wild vine was open to cross-pollination. One of these seedlings was named Concord, and the variety was exhibited before the Massachusetts Horticultural Society in the fall of 1852. The new grape was introduced in the spring of 1854 by Hovey * Company of Boston This variety has grown into phenomenal popularity ever since its origin So popular became the variety that within a short period of a year its </seg>
            <seg id="p046">46 can Institute awarded the Concord the Greeley prize as being the best crape for general cultivation. tThe Moore's Early is said to be a seedling of Concord discovered by ptain John B. Moore of Concord. It was introduced by its originator 1877. when it was awarded a first class certificate of merit by the Ma* husetls Horticultural Society. The vines differ from the Concord in being less productive and more ncertain bearers. This variety will grow well only in a rich, well - rained, and loose soil such as is found in cleared timberland; then it lould be carefully pruned and attended to in every way. The bunches are smaller and less compact than the Concord, and, due to the bad shat - ring habit, is considered a poor shipping or marketing variety. The berries are larger than the Concord, but if conditions are not propitious, e berries will crack. The Quality is considered not as high as that of te Concord, yet the flesh character and flavor are essentially those of e older variety. Its merit lies in its earliness, since it is from two to ree weeks earlier than the Concord. Although the fruit ripens from two to three weeks earlier than the Concord, it does not keep well. In size, length, and breadth the clusters are intermediate. The berries are large to better than medium, roundish dark purplish black to black, abundantly covered with a bluish bloom. The skin is not as thick as Concord, but Is tender, adherent to the pulp, and not astringent. Although the Concord when originated was favorably received, the Campbell's Early was still more favorably received. This grape when mature is high in quality, free from a foxy and acid taste about the seeds. The small seeds are easily parted from the flesh of the berry. The bunches, which are large, compactly clustered, and well shouldered, often weigh 1% pounds. The berries vary somewhat in size, though usually large. They are roundish to slightly oval, dark purplish-black, rather dull as the season advances, and covered with a heavy bloom of blue color, persistent and moderately firm. Although the skin is medium to thin, it nevertheless is tough enough to not crack, it adheres slightly to the pulp and is somewhat astringent. Unlike that of the Concord, the juicy flesh is somewhat vinous, and nearly sweet from skin to center. The quality Is superior to the Concord and improves by hanging on the vine. The fruit is better than the Concord, in that it ripens more uniformly and about two weeks earlier. It also ships better, in that the berries do not shatter so badly, and the flavor does not deteriorate after packing. Geo. W. Campbell, of Delaware, Ohio, after spending much time and energy in the Improvement of grapes, finally produced this variety. He pro - duced this variety from seed of the Moore's Early which had been pol - linated by another one of his productions. This particular production was a seedling of Belvidere, pollinated by Muscat Hamburg. It has been introduced comparatively recently, that is in 1892, by Geo. S. Joselyn of Fredooia, New York. It was received with much enthusiasm and ad - mitted by all to be a good grape, yet it is not the grape that it was hoped </seg>
            <seg id="p047">OKAPES FOR THE MIDDLE WEST. to be by the various growers in almost every state and territory, who welcomed it with hopeful expectations that it would be something of the vinefera type, yet perfectly hardy. tit has not met the expectations of the grape growers in that it is not pted to as many soils and conditions as are some of the varieties ch it must compete with, and if grown in localities In which it is not particularly adapted, this variety lacks productiveness. It lacks that cosmopolitan peculiarity of the Concord. The fruit attains its full color before it is ripe, and since it is often marketed in this condition by ig - norant growers, its quality has been unfavorably criticised. Besides, it must be severely pruned or it will bear itself to death. It means that if a grower wishes to get the best, results, he must give this grape special attention and not treat it as he would any of the types like the Concord, which have a very elastic constitution and give fairly good results even if treated rather shabbily. The trouble with us is that we do not give the Campbell's Early and many other varieties of superior merit the spe - cial care that is in vogue among the European vineyardiste who grow their varieties bo successfully. Mr. Alexander, formerly near Peru, in speaking about the Duchess variety, tells us that grapes can be laid down and covered with soil for $12 per acre and that the product of twelve of these vines would pay the bill. This gives us an idea of what could be done if we simply practice a little more special care. We should not condemn grapes as worthless that have not been given proper treatment. The Worden is a seedling of the Concord, originated by Sehuyler Worden of Minetta, Oswego county. New York, in 1863. It was intro - duced by J. A. Place of Oswego, New York, a prominent horticulturist and friend of Worden. This variety has a larger berry and bunches, is of better quality, and from a week to ten days earlier than the Concord. In hardiness, health, vigor, and productiveness it equals its parent. Oc - casionally it will do better than the Concord, but in its adaptation to soil and other conditions it is more particular. The Worden is the best known and the most meritorious of the many products of the Concord, in that it possesses many of the good qualities and lacks some of the poorer ones of its parent. This variety, however, has some grave defects. Often a very profit - able crop can not be marketed due to the cracked fruits. When the Con - cord cracks in unfavorable weather, the berries can partly or wholly beal over this injury, but the Worden has a thin skin, and besides lacking the faculty of overcoming its Injuries by the growing over of the cracks, it has a softer pulp. Then, there is more juice, which impairs the shipping and keeping qualities. This variety also loses its berries badly, especially when over-ripe and in certain peculiar seasons. It does not hang well on the vines; hence it ought to be harvested promptly, then it can sell for a better price than the Concord providing it is used for immediate consumption. As said before, the fruit ripens one or two weeks earlier than Concord, but doea not keep long. The clusters are large medium to long, broad, tapering to cylindrical, usually single shouldered, and </seg>
            <seg id="p048">48 somewhat compact. The large, roundish to oval berries are dark-pur - plish black, to black, glossy, covered with a heavy bloom, and moderately Ann. The skin Is of average thickness, somewhat tender, cracks badly, adheres slightly to the pulp, and is astringent. The flesh is Juicy, slightly foxy In taste, sweet at the skin to tart at the center, and is mild and very good in quality. One of the best red grapes is represented by the Brighton. This variety is an offspring of Diana Hamburg, a hybrid of Vinifera with Labrusca, and Concord, a pure bred Labrueca. Very few Labrusca Vinifera hybrids have come into prominence in commercial vineyards, but Brighton is in high esteem. It ranks as one of the leading amateur grapes in New York and is among the ten or twelve chief commercial aorta of the state. It is a seedling of Diana Hamburg pollinated by Con - cord, raised by Jacob Moore at Brighton, New York, about 1870. I The fruit ripens mid-season, but eventually keeps fairly well for a rt time, and then deteriorates rapidly after rinening. The clusters very large to medium, usually long, broadish tapering, often heavily uldered and loose to compact. The berries are irregular, medium to ler large in size, roundish to slightly oval, light and dark red, some - it glossy, covered with dark lilac bloom, handsome and persistent, but Arm. The skin, though rather thick, is very tender, adheres con - rably to the pulp, and is astringent. The flesh is melting, aromatic )us. sweet, and agreeably tart to the center of the berry and is of ,■ good quality. Another pleasant feature is the ease with which the Is separate. The good points of the Brighton are its adaptability to ous soils, ability to resist fungous and insect diseases, its high quality, dsome appearance, certainty of ripening, its vigorous growth and 1 being earlier than the Concord. If it were not for two serious defects, there is no doubt it would have taken still higher rank as a commercial sort. It deteriorates very quickly In quality after maturity, and, due to its poor keeping qualities, it can not be well shipped to distant markets. Then it is self-sterile, more so than any of our common varieties. It will not endure our severe winter* without protection. One of the good market grapes where a white grape is desired is found in. the Diamond grape (or Moore's Diamond). It was origiuated about 1870 from Concord seed fertilized with Iona pollen by Jacob Moore from Brighton. New York. Toe strain of the Vinifera in it has been just enough to give to it the richness in flavor of the old Worden grape, and yet has not overcome that refreshing sprightliness or foxiness so peculuu to our native varieties. This native character seems to give a certain ■pice that is bo well liked by all who have become accustomed to it. It Is to be regretted that this variety is not known better commer - cially. Unfortunately it is often sold as Niagara, and as a result has not established its reputation. It surely is a good commercial variety, for besides being of high quality, the fruit packs, carries, and keeps well. Consumers need only to become more acquainted with it, and there Is no </seg>
            <seg id="p049">GRAPES FOB THE MIDDLE WEST. 49 doubt that the demand for it would be such that it would command a fancy price, and thereby more than make up for its lack in fruitfulnes*. It Is an excellent wine grape and especially in demand among wine - makers for making champagnes. Although Niagara is considered as first among the green grapes, the Diamond rivals it very closely. After the Diamond becomes as well ad - vertised there is no doubt that it will possess the Niagara's high rank. Considering the wants of amateurs and winemakers. the Diamond ranks indeed among the best all-around grape. To its desirable characters are added earliness, hardiness, productiveness, and vigor. Although Niagara is more productive in some localities, it nevertheless falls short of the Diamond in many essential characteristics. This variety is surpassed in quality and beauty by only few other grapes. It is a large, handsome grape, of good quality, hardy, healthy, and productive. The fruit ripens slightly earlier than the Niagara and keeps well. The clusters are vari - able in size, medium to short, rather broad, somewhat blunt, cylindrical to slightly tapering, often single-shouldered and compact. The berries are above medium to medium in size, roundish to strongly ovate on ac - count of compactness, green with tinge of yellow on riper berries, but less yellow than Niagara, glossy, persistent, rather firm, and covered with a thin gray bloom. The skin is thin, yet toughish, adheres to the pulp somewhat, and is astringent. The flesh is juicy, tender, rather melt - ing, slightly aromatic, sprightly, nearly sweet next to the skin, and agree - ably tart at the center. The seeds separate quite easily from the pulp. Another excellent white or green grape is the Dutchess. Mr. Alexan - der, formerly of Peru, Nebraska, has grown this grape for twenty years. and it has always given him the best of satisfaction. According to him, it produced immense crops of finest quality, and as a table grape it has no superior. It has a most delicious flavor, is handsome in appearance, and has long-keeping qualities. Its drawback is that the vine is tender to cold and rather fastidious as to the soil and other conditions; yet these defects can easily be controlled. The berries do not ripen uniformly, and in unfavorable soils the berries and bunches are small and hang loose and scatteringly. The foliage and berries are very susceptible to fungi. If we could get rid of these defects, we would have one of the most ex - cellent varieties, satisfactory in almost every essential. It is a pure - flavored, refreshing, juicy grape, sweet and rich, and yet does not cloy the appetite. The flesh is sparkling, fine-grained, tender, vinous, and of a most pleasant flavor and high quality. The seeds are tender, easily crushed, and readily separate from the pulp. The skin has small dots, is thin, yet tough enough for good keeping, adheres to the pulp, and is not astringent. The berries are medium in size, roundish to oval, a yellow - green to a bronze-like tinge and covered with a thin gray bloom. The berries are firm and do not shell or shatter when shipped. The fruit is ripe about the latter part of August to the first part of September, and is a good shipper and keeper. Since the Dutchess is rather capricious, it </seg>
            <seg id="p050">50 Eor pruned too severely, and then, since It Is self-fertile, should be ted between other varieties. It should also be covered in winter. If grapes are picked before they are too ripe, as they will then crack, are covered with bags to keep out rots, especially fine clusters will be ined. The Dutchesg was originated and introduced by A. J. Caywood, of Marlboro, New York. This took place in 1868 and 1880 respectively. It came from seed of a white Concord seedling, pollinated by mixed pollen of Delaware and Walter. Its maternal parent was a white offspring of Concord, pollinated by Montgomery. Other good grapes are the Lady Washington, Empire State, Green Mountain. Niagara, and Geneva, which are white; the Jefferson, Rogers No. 1, and Goethe, which are red; and the Mills, Rogers No. 10, Herbert, and Ammia, which are black. In this paper the various good points and the defects have been briefly touched upon with an Idea of helping any prospective fruit grower in his selection of certain varieties. No variety as yet is perfect, and that means much work along the lines of grape breeding can be carried on so that a perfect or standard grape can be grown in Nebraska. A variety in order to be perfect in Nebraska should have the follow - ing points: Perfect hardiness against adverse climatic conditions and insect and fungous pests; an elastic constitution: large, well-formed, and uniform bunches and berries: fruits with a high enough sugar content, so that they will keep and ship well, and make high grade wines and raisins; a rich, delicate, and vinous flavor, like that of the Old World grape* plus the refreshing sprigbtliness of the American sorts; a sweet, thin, yet tough, skin free from astringency; a fleshy pulp with the seeds small and separating readily; a firm and persistent berry — one that will not shatter or shell from the peduncles; vines that are more compact in habit, making a Etockier annual growth, which does not require such severe pruning and special training; and fruit borne in the large quan - tities, vine for vine, or acre for acre, as is characteristic of the Old World varieties. DISCUSSION. President: If there is any one who wishes to ask Mr. HofMann any questions they may do it now. Q. When is the right time to trim vines? I A. The best time to trim vines is just before the sap begins to flow the spring. Some nice late winter day or early spring day is the best *; but don't wait until the sap begins to flow or the vine will bleed. Q. How would late October or early March do; of those two dates which would you select? A. If I wished to propagate and make new vines I would prefer to prune In late October, but otherwise I would prune the early part of March. There doesn't seem to be much difference otherwise between the two dates, late October or early March. I haven't seen much differ- </seg>
            <seg id="p051">51 ference. I always trim in the early part of March before the sap begins C. H. Barnard: I have noticed that if you prune in October you lay the grapes down on the ground, and will have a protection that will help to save a great many of the vines that you could not save in any other way if you leave them on the trellis. We have practiced this for many years, and we get a better crop by early trimming in October or Novem - ber and by letting the vines lie on the ground. It is a big job, but the snow and litter and leaves will help to make a covering. A. A. Alexander estimated the cost at about $12 per acre for laying down and covering the vines, but as the product is so much better it will pay for the laying of them down. Going back to the matter of pruning. It would be advis - able, in fact it is the only way you can go at it, to trim the vines and then lay them down. President: If there is nothing else we will now hear from Mr. J. R. Duncan, on the subject of "The Plum." PLUMS. J. R. Duncan, Peru. Plum culture in Nebraska has almost become a by-word among fruit growers. Why? Several things have caused this lack of interest, but the cureulio and fruit-rot were the worst offenders, these enemies being so serious that many growers gave up in disgust. Some kinds of plums are more susceptible than others, so that selection of varieties gives us encouragement to continue to grow plums. Professor Waugh says there are some 300 varieties of plums listed by American nurserymen. These are divided into several different groups. Briefly they are as follows: Domestics or Europeans, comprising the prune of commerce. Green Gages, Damsons, Lombard, and other large red, and yellow sorts. The plums of this group are very fine flavored, usually large and showy, rather long and pointed, trees vigorous, upright growers. The Japanese group, first imported into this country about 1870, have smooth bark, leaves somewhat longer, narrower and smoother than Do - mesticas, fruit shorter and more round. Fruit is borne on new growth as well as on fruit spurs. Colors ranging towards cherry reds and yel - r. Flavor not so good as the Domesticas. The plums of this group adapting themselves to a large part of the United States. Americana* — Native wild plums of northern United States. EHortulana — Trees more open and more willowy growth than the ricanas. Fruits somewhat astringent and thinner skinned than Amer- Chicasa — Native wild plums of the southern states, and only a few varieties that succeed this far north. More resistant to rot than other southern grown sorts. Thought to be a hybrid of Americana: and Hor- </seg>
            <seg id="p052">52 Myrobolan— Native wild plum of France. Used as stocks in propaga - tion of cultivated sorts. Americanas are largely used for Americanas and peach for Japanese where winters are not too severe. t Beech Plum— Native of New England states. Chief value Is orna - ■tal. Of all these varieties and groups the ones of most interest to are the Americanas, Hortulanas. Japanese, and their hybrids. We w a few Domesticas with indifferent success, and as a class they are no importance at all here. [The Japanese make strong growing trees and bear abundant crops fruit. They will stand lower temperatures, in winter than the peach, eir great drawback is early blooming in spring and danger of being itroyed by late frosts. However, this can be overcome by the use of hard heaters. The fruit of the Japanese is usually good sited, fair ility. and good shippers. Americanas are hardy, vigorous growers and bear annual crops of medium size, various colored fruits, of good flavor, somewhat astringent as a class, but fine for canning and preserving. Some varieties are ex rcllent eating out of the band. This group is the best class of plums for Nebraska. There are numerous varieties of this class, so that no one ran fail to find something suited to their conditions. kOf the Hortulana group we have only a few varieties of importance Wild Goose. Miner. Waylanrt, arc representative types and too well in to need description. KThe only representative of the ('hirasas that is hardy this far mirth the Pnttawattamie, another very worthy plum. I Out of Professor Waugh's list of three hundred varieties there are y a comparatively few varieties that are successful here in Nebraska, these the majority would be Americanas. a few Japanese, and several irids. There are a number of hybrids of recent introduction that -are rthy of extended trial. Of these the best way to find out their be - ior is to try them out under our individual conditions. Professor Dsen has done considerable work along this line in producing varieties t would withstand the cold dry winters of the Northwest. There is great work for plant breeders to produce varieties that have the high Jity of the Domesticas, hardiness of the Americanas, and bearing and or of the Japanese. Yet, after all, what will it profit us if we get better sorts and let the curculio and fruit-rot destroy our crops? In the old order of things the grower would set out a plum thicket or orchard and let it care for itself. Then the curculio and fruit-rot or monillla came along and harvested the crop before the owner could get around. So that plum growing was very unprofitable, and growers gave up in disgust. t Under the lew methods, with improved machinery, sprayers, etc., can control these enemies and make plum growing one of the proflt - branches of horticulture. There is always a good demand for good ns at remunerative prices and not enough to go round. In order to </seg>
            <seg id="p053">53 combat successfully the enemies of the plum we must know something of their habits and mode of attack. The curculio is a sniall dark grayish insect about one-fourth Inch long with prominent snout, with which he punctures the fruit or leaves. The adult curculio emerges from the ground leaves when trees bloom and young plums commence to attain size. Then the female curculio deposits eggs in the small plum. In about three weeks the eggs hatch and the grub eats into the plum. By the time he is full grown the plum is prematurely ripened and falls to the ground. Then the grub comes out of the plum and hides under old dead leaves, trash, or goes into the ground to complete the next cycle of its existence. When next he emerges he is full grown curculio and ready to feed on leaves and fruit not yet ripened, until winter drives him into the ground again. In order to suc - cessfully fight the curculio we clean up our orchards thoroughly, prune them so they may be easily sprayed, and let the sun shine into the trees. Before going further I will give a brief description of the working of the fruit-rot of monlllia. The spores live over the winter on dead leaves, body of trees, and dried up fruits left hanging on trees. These spores do not show any signs of life until warm weather in summer. Then when a warm wet spell comes and plums are about half or two-thirds grown the spores get busy. Possibly the wind or some insect has carried the spore and left it clinging to the skin of the plum where there is a bruise or puncture. Then the warm wet weather starts the spores to growing. This is what we call fruit-rot. • V In our preliminary treatment for curculio we must remove all trash and brush from orchard after pruning, and then thoroughly cultivate the ground. We should endeavor to stir the entire surface to a depth of sev - eral inches. Thoro cultivation should be continued at intervals of ten days during the season until about August 1. This frequent stirring of the soil prevents the curculio from hiding in the ground and also destroys a good many grubs. In controlling the fruit-rot, in addition to the treat - ment for curculio we must be sure that all dried mummies of plums left on the trees over winter should be removed and destroyed. While the trees are dormant give a thoro spraying with lime-sulphur, 1 gallon to 11 gallons of water. This is a very important spraying, and bodies of trees should be thoroly covered. Then just after the first leaves come out and before the blossoms open, spray with arsenate of lead, 2 pounds to 50 gallons of water. Immediately after the blossoms fall, spray with combined spray, using lime-sulphur 1 to 50 and arsenate of lead 2% pounds to 50 gallons of water. Follow this at intervals of ten days until plums are over half grown. At this time a lime-sulphur spray of 1 to 50 strength should be applied. This application will usually be in time to prevent the spores of the fruit-rot getting a start. The main object in all the spraying is to keep the fruit and foliage covered with poison and fungicide so that the curculio can not feed without getting some of the poison and the spores of the fruit-rot have no plac* to grow. In addition </seg>
            <seg id="p054">54 to the foregoing the fruit should be thinned so that no two plums will touch. tl believe that with thorough cultivation, spraying, and thinning, we reduce the loss by these enemies to a minimum and make plum 'ing one of the most profitable branches of horticulture. tin conclusion, a word regarding marketing. The manner of market - and packages depend entirely on the kinds of plums you grow and ket you have. Where we grow the larger showier sorts and have a riminating market, the four-basket crate is a very nice package. For jr sorts and markets the 24-quart berry crates and boxes and 8-pound *? basket, ara commonly employed. Some places you can market the &gt; in bushel and half-bushel baskets. In whatever way you sell them sure that nothing but first class fruit honestly packed leaves the tAs to varieties. I would say that your local conditions govern that ely. Find out what your neighboring fruit growers are successfully ring, then plant accordingly. Any new sort that you think worthy that may be better than any you already have should be given • 1. I do not think every one should have an experimental farui, but need to encourage the plant breeders in their work, in creating new eties of plums, as our list of real high quality plums that are suc - ful here is limited. *■ &lt;L DISCUSSION. I Professor Emerson: Did you ever notice any injury paiticularly to Japanese plums from spraying with lime and sulphur at the rate of 50? A. I have never seen any injury at all. Q. Did you use lime combined with sulphur? A. Yea! and we have had good results by combining the two. I President: If there are no further questions we will now proceed the next subject on the program, which is: "Some wild fruits which ;ht to be cultivated," by Dr. C E. Bessey, of the University. Dr. Bessey read his paper, which is as follows SOME WILD FRUIT8 WHICH OUGHT TO BE CULTIVATED. Charles E. Bessey, University of Nebraska. Nebraska is not usually regarded as rich in edible wild fruits, and T«t if one looks over the wild fruits that occur in the state he may easily make op a Hat of at least twenty-five kinds that may be well thought of as worthy of cultivation. And I have no doubt that all of these, and mor«, too, will be cultivated, when we have lived here a century or two looser. For man is a wasteful creature. He rushes into a new country and usually pays no attention to the wild products be finds, other than to 41g them out u fast as be needs the ground for his Imported plants. </seg>
            <seg id="p055">WILD FRUITS WHICH OCOHT TO BB CULTIVATED 55 Then much later he wakes up to the fact that his imported things will not grow as well as he would like them to, and he then begins to turn about for something to replace his failures. In some cases these failures came so early that he began long ago to improve the wild fruits around him, and in all cases the results have been satisfactory. And it is to bring some of these wild things to your attention that I am before you today. In doing so I am presuming that you are willing to do some work without the prospect of immediate payment on your investment, for work of this kind often does not pay as large dividends as are obtained by following the old beaten paths. But my brothers, I want to set before you an ideal higher than that involved in mere money return for our lives. We have a span ot life allotted to us. It includes so many years. We sell our labor in these years as we go through life. What do we get in return? Is it really worth while for us to sell our labor, our strength, our youth, our lives for mere money? Do not think I affect to despise money, for I do not, and I wish I had more of it: but no man should be contented to look back on a life which has brought him only money, wealth, a fortune. And you, fellow workers in the Lord's Vineyard should feel the necessity of a greater return than this. All thru the ages there have been men of pui profession, who have felt a great desire to add to the riches of the vine - yards and orchards and gardens it may be one additional variety, and these men we honor, and the world honors. And yet may I say here that it should be the ambition of eveYy grower of fruit to leave the world richer, by at least one new fruit, than when he began his work. Just as the right-minded farmer wishes to leave his farm to his children, richer and better than when he began to work on it, so the fruit grower should wish to add his contribution to the list of the fruits that the world may enjoy. So I am preaching the gospel of a higher horticulture than that which has to do with its commercial aspects alone. Let these receive full at - tention at your hands. Push this work with all the vigor of good and efficient business men; but let me urge you to consider also that higher attainment which is concerned with the betterment of the world. I preach to you the gospel of making a better world of fruits for the fu - ture. Let us be helpers. Let us add to the good fruits of the world. Let us leave better gardens, vineyards, and orchards of fruits than we found. Let us hand down to our children more and better fruits than were handed to us. With this introduction let me point out somewhat in detail what are some of the wild fruits of Nebraska that merit our careful attention. Th« Sand Cherry (Prunua Besseyi). Many yean ago I called attention to this wild shrub of the tand-hlll region of the state, and urged Its Introduction into cultivation. The time that has elapsed since then has seen the Justification of what was than k </seg>
            <seg id="p056">56 prophecy, for we now have ample evidenee of the worth of this native berry. As most of you are aware, Professor Hansen of the Agricultural College of South Dakota has produced many hybrids of the sand cherry with other related fruits with most promising results. He has shown hat in this wild cherry of our plains we have a fruit that is worthy of our best care and cultivation. But we do not need to go to South Dakota in order to learn of the value of the sand cherry. Professor M. R. Gilmore of Bethany, three miles east of Lincoln, has grown this fruit for a number of years. At my request he made the following statement under date of December 14, (11: "I submit these notes from the observations I have made on the behavior of some native fruits of Nebraska which I have taken from their wild state and planted in my garden. I have a clump of bushes of the sand cherry (Prunus becseyi) which I brought from a sand ridge in the northwest part of Douglas county near Valley and planted at Bethany in Lancaster county. They flourish and have borne fruit very 1 abundantly every year since they were set. They are fully resistant to drought, late frost, and inimical organisms, whether insects or parasitic plants. They Man to be wholly triumphant over any adverse conditions pertinent to tnis region. With me they have responded to the slightest degree of cultivation by an increase in their already abundant fruit-bearing. My clump of about three by six feet in area yielded last summer three gal - lons or more of cherries, which in sixe approximate ordinary Early Rich - mood cherries." 1 may add to this testimony the statement that from a quantity of the cherries brought last summer from Professor Gilmore's plantation a dosen or so of cherry pies were made, and these were tested by the Botan - ical Seminar of the University of Nebraska, and pronounced to be equal to those made from ordinary orchard cherries. Buffalo Berry (Shepherdia argentea) bFor an acid fruit the buffalo berry is worthy of cultivation. It is y and apparently free from the usual enemies of so many of our bby fruits. It might bar used as a substitute for the cranberry. Gooseberries (Ribes sp.) We have wild gooseberries in almost every part of the state, which in their wild condition are quite edible, and which under cultivation should give us something to replace our old kinds, many of which will not do well in this climate. Currants (Ribes aureum). In the western counties I found some years ago that the golden flow - ered currant was under cultivation, not for its flowers, as with us, but for its fruits, and I was told that the people there prized them and re - garded them as well worth cultivating. </seg>
            <seg id="p057">WILD FBUITS WHICH OUGHT TO BE CULTIVATED 57 Raspberries iRubus spj. Kit would be a good thing for every grower of fruits to take up some ie bushes of the wild raspberries he finds in bis neighborhood, for no t among these he would find some equal to, or superior to those he had under cultivation. The same may be said of the wild blackber - in those parts of the state where they are to be found. Juneberrie* (Amelanchier sp.). In the eastern part of the state we find the tree-like juneberry, which would be quite troublesome to grow on account of iU tall growth, but further west there are juneberries that are shrubby, rarely growing more than four to six feet in height. These shrubby juneberries are very good to eat, and would add much to the value of one's small-fruit plantation. Elderberries (Sambucus canadensis). KThe common black elderberry so abundant in many places in Ne - ka should long ago have been taken in hand and improved. Even in wild state the fruits are palatable, and from them good jams and ries can be made. I have eaten many a piece of elderberry pie, and ed for more. It is a wild fruit that ought not to be longer neglected. Strawberries (Fragaria sp). t Everybody knows how good wild strawberries are, and yet few of us s taken them up and given them that cultivation under which they it be expected to develop into stronger and larger and still better eties. So I was very much pleased when Professor Gilmore volun ed to give me his experience, which is so favorable that I quote It "I also took up some wild strawberries from a patch near Dead Man's Run. five miles east of Lincoln. They have nourished wonderfully well fruiting most abundantly, and coming into bearing earlier and continuing in fruit at least a week longer than any cultivated variety that I know By being freed from competition of the prairie grasses they respondec at once by an increase of fully 100 per cent in the size of the indivldua fruits. They are superior in color and flavor to the cultivated varieties and very resistant to drought and other adverse conditions. They do not seem to 'run out' by continuance of the same stock in the same place year after year as our cultivated varieties do. The gathered fruits also resist decay much longer than the common cultivated varieties. I founc my wild stock- to consist of three types: one of appreesed conical form and closely adherent to the calyx, another of a more acutely conical form and standing well up from the calyx, or 'hull,' and possessed of a firm texture and rich color; the third is like the lint In form but of lei* firm </seg>
            <seg id="p058">58 Kmuch more desirable, and the most responsive to cultivation according my observation." Wild Black Cherry (Primus Eerotina) Here I refer to the common wild black cherry, of the eastern states, which has crept into eastern Nebraska, following the wooded bluffs of the Missouri river. Ever since my boyhood days I have felt that a cherry with so good a taste ought to be improved in size, and made to yield a larger amount of flesh for a given amount of stone. It is unquestionably worthy of your careful attention. Western Black Cherry (Prunus melanocarpa). On the plains we have a smaller tree that produces larger cherries, and that I feel is even more desirable as an original stock than the east - ern wild black cherry. This western fapecies has been slandered by hav - ing bestowed upon it the name of choke cherry, although it is not a choke ifceuj at all. It often grows as a slender shrub, and at the height of four to five feet it is sometimes loaded with fruit- I found the ripe cher - ries to have a rather thick flesh of a very good taste, and I have eaten piea made of them, and pronounced them very good indeed. This species is well worthy of the serious attention of every fruit grower of an ex - perimental turn of mind. Wild Plums (Prunus sp.) These have been brought under cultivation to such an extent that they have given us most of the successful varieties for the prairies and Great Plains. Wild Grapes (Vitis sp.) While it appears that our wild grapes have in the past received the attention of experimental fruit growers, it is still true that very little is being done in this direction in Nebraska at the present time. Any one who has paid any attention to the wild grapes in his neighborhood has observed that they are quite variable in regard to the size and quality of the grapes. This should suggest the probability that under cultiva - tion our wild grapes would respond most profitably. We can not afford to let these really good wild grapes grow in the unappreciated way that has prevailed so largely in the past. Last fall Professor Gilmore, whom I have already quoted twice in connection with other fruits, brought me a bottle of unfermented grape juice made from wild grapes gathered on the Omaha Indian Reservation in the northeastern part of the state, and I can personally testify to the very superior quality of the product. In tact, I don't think I have ever tasted as food a quality of grape Juice manufactured from the cultivated grape. tNow all of the foregoing fruits may be said to be practically certain take a profitable response to cultivation, so that all that is needed is </seg>
            <seg id="p059">WILD FRUITS WHICH OUGHT TO BE CULTIVATED. 59 for the improvements to be made when the results may be confidently expected to be acceptable to our palates. In other words, the people are ready to buy and eat the foregoing fruits when they are ameliorated and modified by cultivation. Now I wish to suggest half a dozen or so of our wild fruits that are still wholly in the experimental stage. In fact, I am not at all certain that people will eat some of the following things even though we were to cultivate them in considerable quantities. And yet I think it is worth our while to seek to add these to the list of fruits that we grow in our orchards and plantations. Wild Apples (Malus ioensis). Here I refer to what are commonly called wild crab apples, and which grow in the eastern and northeastern portions of the state. As 1 pointed out many years ago in a paper read before this society, our tree is not strictly a crab apple, but it is in reality a wild apple, allied rather closely with the wild apple of the Old World from which all of our culti - vated varieties of apples have come. And it is a fact that in this native wild apple we have a better primitive stock than our forefathers found when they first took up the wild apple of Europe and Asia. Sometimes when I have urged fruit growers to begin improving our wild apple 1 have been met by the remark that the Old World apple is good enough, but this I am sure will not be your attitude, and I hope to live to eat pal - atable apples derived by some of you from our native wild apple. Hawthorns (Crataegus sp.) rlvery one who has observed our hawthorns closely has been imprewd the fact that they are very variable as to their fruits, and every one of you who was a boy in a region where hawthorns were abundant will remember that on some trees the fruits were very good tasting. Of course there is not a great deal of flesh on these little. fruits, but what there is of it is good. Now since these are hardy trees, what more nat - ural suggestion can I make than that, after carefhl selection, an attempt should be made to ameliorate the taste and increase the size of the fruits of some of our native hawthorns? Rose Apples (Rosa sp.) Eere again I must appeal to your boyhood recollection of the good you often found in the flesh of the rose apples that grow on the m. Even now as I run across the ripe, red apples on our low wild rose I am always tempted to eat all that I find, and my taste still assures me that tiey are good eating now, and I am sure that they could b« greatly Improved by cultivation and selection. L«t »ome one start with a carefully selected wild form, and then plant the seeds of the largeat and finest apples, doing this for a number of generation*. I am confident that In these pretty red fruits we hav* the promise of what man might </seg>
            <seg id="p060">60 do were he to undertake the work with seriousness and for a series of Prickly Pears (Opuntia sp.) In many parts of the state one or more species of prickly pears grow spontaneously upon the dry soil, and in spite of the dryness of soil or Intense heat of the sunshine they produce their sweet and succulent fruits. Would it not be a wise thing for us to seek to increase the iiu and succulence of these fruits, since the plants are so well adapted to the dryest and hottest of situations, and certainly- there are many places in the state, especially in the central and western portions, where such plants alone can be grown. Ground Cherries (Physalis sp.) It is a curious fact that the only species of the ground cherry that we cultivate came from Asia or South America, while we have neglected our own wild species, some of which are very promising. I am convinced that if we were to enlarge the size of the sweet berry to about double its present diameter we should add another to our rather short list of jam - yielding fruits. The experiment is worth trying at any rate. Wild Tomatoes (Solanum nigrum, S. Trinorum). Although we commonly call these nightshades, they have been show to respond so easily to cultivation that they may well be called wild to - matoes, although at the present time the fruiu are very small, rangin from a quarter of an inch to half an inch in diameter. Already the firs species under cultivation has enlarged its fruiu to a full half-inch diameter. Under the name of "prairie huckleberries" they have bee much advertised of late, and while the name is wholly wrong and mis - leading, the fruits themselves are worthy of cultivation and still fuithe improvement. In time they may be made to yield as a tomato-like fru from half an inch to an inch in diameter. Ground Plums (Astragalus caryocarpus) tAll over the plains and prairies there may be found the early flowe and fruiting ground plums with their very succulent, few-seeded pods spreading plants spring up each year from a hardy, perennial roo because of this fact they blossom very early in the spring, and pro - &gt; their fruits very shortly after. It is commonly said that the ear! elers across the Plains used these lruits for food, cooking them as w t peas or string beans. As the plants are perennial, it will be ver ily seen that here would be a most decided advantage which these plants would have over all of our present peas and beans. t There yet remain only a few nut-bearing trees, which are not com - ly reckoned among those which bear fruits, and yet it must be re- </seg>

Re from its value as a timber tree the black walnut is worthy of on for its edible nuts. By taking pains to plant only the beat it should not be difficult to materially modify for the better this excellent nut. Butternut! (Juglans cinerea). What I have said of the black walnut may be said in regard to the butternut. Hickory NuU (Hicoria ovata. H. laciniosa). Pere may be repeated what was said above in regard to the black t. It will pay to try to grow and improve these wild nuts, which wild in the extreme southeastern part of the state. In the forego - ha\p enumerated the principal wild fruits of Nebraska that in my opinion are worthy of being cultivated, and 1 am hopeful that some or all of you will try to acid at least one fruit from this list to those now .ultivated. DISCUSSION EMr. Yager: I would like to ask Dr. Bessey if there is any way of de - ining what is the real strawberry from the native seedling? Near plantation we find everywhere strawberries and black raspberries are supposed to be wild. We find them in every shape, form, color, condition. We are growing in the neighborhood of some forty varie - nf strawberries for experimental purposes. Dr. Beasey: The only way to do would be to go out to a place suffi - ciently remote from your plantation. We have one very well-known species growing in this portion of Nebraska. As you say, there is an enormous mixing up of these wild plants. It is a very difficult thing to tell whether the thing you speak of is a wild raspberry or not if you are near the raspberry plantation, but if you are back where you have no tame raspberries or patches, there you will be sure that you have the wild species. Take it twenty years ago, for instance, near Long Pine, I suppose that was one hundred miles from any raspberry patch at that time, at least it was a good distance. There we found wild raspberries, and they looked very much like some of these that are cultivated, but I am sure they were wild. Mr. Harris: I was very much interested in this long list of wild fruit mentioned by Dr. Bessey, but I think he has failed to mention all of them. I think he has forgotten one which he will call to mind, and that is our Nebraska banana, we call it the pawpaw, in the southern portion of our state. I think it ought to be included in bis list. Dr. Bessey: If the Secretary will call my attention to it I will add </seg>
            <seg id="p062">62 that to my list While I despise the taste of the thin;. I believe it should be added to the list because there is no question that if there is any fruit that can properly be taken care of we should do it, and It will add very materially to our fruit list. President: The next thing on our program is a paper by Mr. C. H. Barnard entitled, "The growing of pears in Nebraska." GROWING PEARS IN NEBRASKA. O. H. Barnard. The growing of pears in Nebraska has in the past been a question that we are all rather inclined to doubt, and having doubted give the benefit of the doubt to the industry and pass it up without the try, try again that has accomplished the growing of apples and other fruit. One thing that has kept planters from making a more thorough test of pear growing has been the price of trees has been so high, or too high for just experimenting. Another thing, the almost universal practice of giving the pear the best place and good cultivation so as to make the best growth, with the idea of bringing to bearing as soon as possible, and in this way induced a tender growth which experience has taught us induced blight of twigs and limbs, and soon the tree is dead from what we term "blight." The first pear trees planted on my place were* standard trees set fif - teen feet apart and in a very rich place, and then we gave this our very best cultivation, and as a result a few years and every tree was gone. An accident first made me think that pears could be grown, and while as yet we have not planted extensively we have a few trees that are doing fine. A short row of pear trees that had been left in a nursery row, being from eighteen inches to four feet apart, have for several years borne good crops and are apparently as hardy as apple trees standing near, and they bear as often as the apple. This row comprises a few Duchess, Bartlett, Louise Bonne, and Buf fum, and are so close that the branches interlace. Each variety bears a fall crop, and there is no difference in the bearing qualities of any one of the varieties. My orchard proper planted fifteen feet apart, before I no - ticed this row of the same varieties, when this row was all full, had some tree* with fair crops and some with none. My last planting I placed them four feet in the row with the rows a little wider and breaking joints in the row. This seems very close plant - ing, but I wish to give it a fair trial and see how it will work out. The varieties are mixed as much as possible with a view to a more perfect pollenixation. In selecting trees for planting I prefer the dwarf trees, and plant deep enough so that the pear stock will develop roots above the bud and thus combine the early bearing of the dwarf tree with the supposed longevity of the standard. </seg>
            <seg id="p063">PERSIMMONS AND THE BIRKETT PEAR. 63 After trees are planted see that you do not try to push the growth of the tree too much, but try and have a very moderate amount of well - ripened wood each year. Anything that will check the growth of pear trees, yet let them pat on a moderate growth, is beneficial in the end toward helping to grow a crop of fruit. A blue grass sod such as many of us have in our yards is one of the beet agencies to help with this work. A clay soil or a lime stone rock mixed with moderately rich soil helps trees planted in our yards, and given a limited cultivation for a few years do well and bring results. By a limited cultivation I mean to keep the grass from closing up around the tree so that scarcely any rain or other moisture can get to the roots of the tree, and yet not that digging and hoeing all the time to keep the tree drinking in all the moisture and appropriating all the fer - tility in reach of the roots. The Chairman: The next paper will be by Mr. J. P. Dunlap, of Dwight, on "Persimmons and the Birkett pear." PERSIMMONS AND THE BIRKETT PEAR. J. R. Dunlap, Dwight. frhe persimmon is native of the southeast quarter of the United ;s, but as there are many people here who have never seen the tree Fruit a short description may be well. In shape, looks,, and size the is much like our native hackberry and has large, thick leaves like the common milkweed. In size the fruit are like plums and are produced in great abundance. While green they are harsh and astringent, but when ripe are luscious. I do not know of any insect that attacks the fruit. They do not bloom until June. Where they grow in the wild woods or from seeds they are various in size and color and quality. The De - partment of Agriculture has been keeping a record of good quality trees. They also have brought different kinds of cultivated persimmons from Asia; so far they have proved too tender for this far north. Of the Amei lean kinds the trees generally are hardy in Nebraska, but many good kinds fail to ripen their fruit on account of our short seasons. Some kinds are hardy and ripen their fruit perfectly. The Ada has proved the best with me. It is of fair size, the color yellow, with red sides, qual - ity good, and ripens perfectly; tree hardy. Uttle Ruby is another that I have good hopes of, but not fully tested; it is red in color. As persimmons do not have perfect blossom it is necessary to have a stamenate tree along with the bearing trees. The better way to grow the trees is to plant the seed where the trees are to grow and let them grow until stamenate trees show bloom, then select those wanted for fertilizers and graft or bud the others. This can be done as successfully as with the apple, but needs to be done by an experienced person. The seedlings should grow two years in the seedling row; then be trans- </seg>
            <seg id="p064">64 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY The persimmons are eaten from the hand or prepared in many ways for food, without cooking, but not so good if cooked. The fruit when ripe can hang on the tree without injury until midwinter; any surplus fruit makes good hog and poultry food, but should have a ration of grain with it. Birkett Pear. I The Birkett pear was sent out by D. B. Wier, of Lacon, Illinois, dur - [ the 70's, if I remember correctly. He propagated from a large old e found on the farm of Mr. Birkett in that vicinity, the tree was noted its large size, hardiness, and productiveness. I got one small tree of a. I think that was in the spring of 1878. and my tree is now about ty-five feet tall. The girth of the trunk is four feet, ten inches, and it &gt;wed a little fire blight when young, but not any more than Ben Davis ;ile near to it. But after cut tine out the bad blighting varieties of ap - s, it, as well as the Ben Davis, has not shown any blight. The Birkett ir, now thirty-three years old, appears to be in perfect health, while the Ben Davis planted about the sump time many arc dead; and all ers are badly damaged from age. For over twenty years the Birkett pear lia* grown fruit &lt;»acb year, although each alternate year the crop is much heavier. I have not meas ured the fruit so as to be exact about it. but an estimate for the last few years since the tree BM attained large size would say about ten bushels for the off years and twenty five bushels for the full years. The fruit ripens in September. A few of the fruit has from one to three seeds each, but the most of them are seedless. The size and quality of the fruit are both below medium for a pear, but on account of the hardiness and great productiveness. I consider it worthy of planting. 1 would rec - ommend in planting to plant at one side of the orchard where It would not be in the way. after the rest of the orchard have died out. In propa - gating, it can be grafted in the usual way, either on pear or apple roots. While it grows readily on apple roots, this grafting makes it a dwarf tree and It bears when quite small; and is of quite slow growth in nur aery. If grafted on pear roots, it grows faster, but never a very fast grower in nursery. In planting in orchard, whether on pear or apple roots, I would recommend planting deeply, so that it could get on its own roots in case of the dying out of the root on which it was grafted. The tree needs very little if any trimming. §The Chairman: The next paper will be number five, the "Compara - b influence of heat and drouth on trees and plants," by L. 0. Williams, University Place. rPARATIVE INFLUENCE OF HEAT AND DROUTH ON TREES AND PLANTS. L. 0. Williams, University Place, Nebraska. It is a common practice among tree planters and gardeners to at - tribute the loss of newly planted trees and plants in a time of drouth to </seg>
            <seg id="p065">65 that cause alone. When we bee vegetation fading under the summer sun we naturally think that lack of water is the cause and begin at once to apply this apparently needed remedy. It is quite apt to be the case that water will help relieve such plants from their distress, but let us study the conditions and see if water is the only panacea for such affected veg- t Plants and animals are much alike in their thirst for water. Both ses have a longing for water in warm weather because it helps us to } cool. When an animal is sick from any cause, it has a desire to in the shade and have water also, for quieting his fever. t Freshly planted trees or plants are in very much the same condition a Bick animal. With their roots torn loose and partially cut away. r tops also more or less mutilated, they are fit subjects for a hospital, v animals, when wounded and bleeding, will seek shelter from the t of the sun. Trees in a like condition have a low vitality, their cir - ition (the flowing sap) is very low, their foliage which might be used their own shelter under normal conditions is insufficient, and they left to swelter and suffer in the broiling sun. You and I can crawl under the shade of a friendly tree when the ercury is climbing up around the hundred mark, but the helpless inani - ate tree must endure the burden and heat of the day without recourse shelter. The season of 1911 was noted here as elsewhere as • very emarkable one in its extremes of both heat and drouth. Tree planters ost very heavily of their newly planted trees and shrubs despite the mount of water that was given them. Out of several plantings that I ade in which the tree trunks were wrapped with burlap, and the roots rotected by mulching, I lost but a very small per cent. These trees re - ived a normal amount of water, but I know of some trees planted under milar conditions that were lost despite a free application of water. Such instances as the above, coupled with observations in a general way, lead me to the conviction that the excessive heat of the past summer was responsible for a much larger damage to vegetation than was the lack of moisture, even tho there was a serious need for this moisture. The effect of the heat upon the blackberry crop was very marked in several cases that came under my observation. In a plantation of three r four acres near Lincoln, coarse manure and straw had been used to ulch all but a small portion of the patch. Strange to say, but it was rue, that the portion that was mulched was nearly ruined by the heat, e berries drying up before attaining their first stage of ripening. On e small part that was not mulched, and not even cultivated, there were everal cases of berries that came to a fair degree of maturity. The wner came to the conclusion that the reflection of the sun from the ulching being cast upwards against the growing berries was the cause their premature drying. The same relative influence of the heat upon te ripening berries in my own plantation was noticeable to a limited xtent. My plantation was young and the mulching not heavy, but the 3 </seg>

In these illustrations, showing the effect of the heat, it will be observed that the effect is reversed from the uiual order. Mulching is recognized as a conserver of moisture, but in ■ season of such over abundant sunshine a contrary effect is produced. Shading the soil by the use of growing vines has some indicated les- sons. In spite of the extreme heat and drouth, I could not fail to notice the remarkable ability of the melon vines to withstand the trial. Vines that received no water by hand, — nothing more than ordinary made a steady growth, through the season, and succeeded finally in producing a good paying crop of melons. Grape vines have the same habit of shad- ins their own roots, and seem to have a similar power of resisting both heat and drouth. The example of the vinous plants and fruits that I have cited shows not only their marked ability to withstand heat and drouth. but emphasizes the need for shading such trees and plants that are in immediate danger of prostration by the heat.

As the poet says, "Save not your Wmtii for my cold brows; if you have any favors give them to me now." bWe grow them to decorate or charm our homes, our parks, our boule - s, our driveways, as an inspiration to Nature's most glorious and rious forms.

There is nothing that inspires draws a person's mind more near to Nature's God than flowers, or :ens or soothes the heart, than flowers.

And of course he did. But as tbey walked and talked through the shady bowers, he wondered who in the world sent her those flowers.

The President: I think that Mr. Henderson's paper Is so complete a presentation in Itself there will hardly be any one that will want to take any exception to any of the statements that are made, so the next paper, which is "Temperature and ventilation of greenhouses," by Mr. Edward Williams of Grand Island, will be read by the Secretary. TEMPERATURE AND VENTILATION OF GREENHOUSES. Edward Williams, Grand Island. Mr. President and Gentlemen: King been assigned the subject "Greenhouse ventilation and tem - ," of same will say, that my experience has been that to properly i a greenhouse is no small matter especially when breaking in a new man. It takes some time to learn to do the operation ana do it right. For instance, a house that should be kept about 70 degrees sun heat, should, as the temperature rises, be given a crack of air two ur three times after the thermometer leaves 62 or 64, not waiting until the thermometer registers 70 and then throw on about six inches of air, and let the temperature down to 58 or 60. The same precaution should be taken when lowering the ventilators. When the thermometer regis - rs 70 start lowering so that you can keep an even temperature as long possible, until the steam is circulated and time to close the ventilators. P relieve that the biggest mistake is made when a florist thinks that k around and watch his ventilators is waste of time, for the more temperature that can be kept the better the results. As a rule fall you read in the trade papers of different growers wanting to know what makes the foliage yellow and soft, the stems weak, soil covered with green scum, flowers off color, carnations split, etc. I dare say that most of this trouble can be traced to poor ventilation. The tem - perature for different plants, to have them do well is as follows: For the tea roses day steam heat should be at 62 to 64 and night heat 58 to 60. The hybrid teas can stand about 2 to 4 degrees higher tem - perature. Carnations such as the Enchantress varieties of which our main ones consist can stand a little higher temperature than the older varieties. I find that I can grow carnations with fair success with the following temperatures: day heat, 56 to 58, night heat 52 to 54, sun heat 70. Miscellaneous plants will do with carnation heat Smilax, calla lilies, and palms will do well with a rose house temperature. Violets' day heat should be 44 to 46 degrees, night heat 42 to 44 degres, when the weather permits ventilation. I believe that during the growing soa- Eon if the houses can be kept about 70 degrees It is about right. Bulbous stuff does very well started in carnation temperature, and moved after the required stems have come to a warmer house if needed. </seg>
            <seg id="p080">80 To have fair success in propagation the temperature must be watched rery closely, for nothing will Bpoil a batch of cuttings quicker than to run the temperature of the sand up and down. This is especially true with roses after they have calloused. Often you will see a big batch of roses in the sand without a leaf on them. You can partly blame this to not keeping the temperature where it ought to be. Roses and all hard wooded plants can stand 10 degrees less, but the quicker the operation is done the better the success in per cent rooted. Another thing to be watched is the ventilation in a propagating house. On large places cheese cloth should be tacked over the ventilators to check the direct draft. The grafting rase is another thing that has to be watched as to tem - perature, ventilating, and so on. But as there 1b not much, if any, of that done by florists in this vicinity, I will not dwell on that subject. Now as to raising your heat, for instance, previous to the holidays, I believe the same answers as to ventilating your houses. Do it by degrees, say 2 degrees every other night or day until you have the required tempera - tun-, which you will have to decide yourself. If your stock is in no shape to stand a high temperature do not do it. For what few extra flowers you gain will be lost ten times over by softening your plants. And right here I want to say that sometimes they do not get over it, so don't get greedy; let well enough alone. I thank you. I The Chairman: Is there any one who wishes to say anything upon subjects in this paper? I The Chairman: Our next subject is Growing chrysanthemums, by in Frey, of Lincoln. * GROWING CHRYSANTHEMUMS. Irwin Frey, Lincoln. In these days of competition growing chrysanthemums is a subject great importance to the wholesale florist or the retail florist that has mpetition, for the flower-buying public is not long in finding out who las the best chrysanthemums; and this at a time of the year when many them have not had occasion to buy flowers for two or three months ay mean the gain or loss of a large number of customers for the entire e»r. I believe there is more difference in the quality of chrysanthemums own in different floral establishments than any other species of flower, mad the difference in profit and loss is correspondingly great, as the cost production is the same regardless of the quality of the crop. We use e following methods in growing chrysanthemums with very satisfactory results. Starting with the stock plants which are planted close together n a good light bench so the cuttings will not be drawn and spindly. We save of each variety in proportion to the number we wish to plant the oniing season. The first lot of cuttings are put in the sand about Feb - ruary 1, these are for growing or for pot plants, of which we grow about ,000, only part of which are sold as pot plants. The larger part are used </seg>
            <seg id="p081">c;i:&lt;&gt;\vi.\&lt;; iiiuvsamiikmims 81 ior c 11 l nowcrs* x novc ftrc £i o^r u w ilii i r oxxi o 10 10 uvw™i 9 per giving a large number of the small and medium sizes for which there is always a good demand. The single varieties are also grown in this way, but without disbudding. The second lot of cuttings are put in the sand about the 15th of March followed by another lot as soon as the cuttings are ready, which usually is about a month later. Should we be short on any varieties, more of these are put in as soon as large enough. We get out benches ready for the young plants between the 15th of June and the 1st of July, placing about one inch of coarse manure on the bottom of the bench, then filling with soil, and adding one-half Inch of manure on the top to be worked into the soil. The plants are placed 7 inches apart in the rows and 9 inches between rows. We have found very little difference, if any, in the size of blooms grown two on a plant, branching the plant about ten inches from the soil, and those grown to single stem. This is true with all varieties except white and yellow Eaton, which are better grown to one flower. No feeding whatever is done until the buds show, and then about one-half inch of manure is put on the beds. This is all the plants get in the way of feeding, as they receive the most good out of this dressing at the time needed, as, through the daily watering, the strength grows lees as the bud develops, and there is no danger of overfeeding at any time. Close disbudding Is essential in growing chrysanthemums, and they should be gone over every three or four days. Neglect in this always shows in the quality of the blooms. The following varieties have proven very satisfactory with us: Early Yellow Golden Glow, planting three different lots about three weeks apart, the first about the 15th of May. These will bloom in August and early September, being followed about two weeks apart by the other plantings. These are succeeded by Robt. Holliday and Col. Appleton, growing enough of these varieties to supply the demand until along in November, when we have Golden Wedding, Yellow Baton, and Golden Chadwick. In white, October Frost, by taking the crown bud, comes quite early and makes a very satisfactory flower; tbese are followed by Polly Rose or White Pacific. E. Touset and Alice Byron are two good raid-season varieties with us, followed by Minnie Wannamaker, T. Baton, and Mrs. W. H. Chadwick. We also grow a large quantity of Yanoma for Christmas, which, while not as good a flower as the other varieties I have mentioned, yields as large returns as any variety on account of being at its best at this time. In pink, our quantity varieties are limited to Pacific Supreme, early midseason, followed by A. J. Balfour. We have found the returns are much less on the pink varieties than on the yellow and whites, while the demand for red is not large enough to warrant growing them.

That is true, and 1 used to think that way myself, too, but the truth is, my man kept on mulching a little too long and too late, and he finally had the flowers all burned up. If you mulch them too late it burns up the petals, especially on the white varieties, and we do not get the best results. I had quite a number of flowers spoiled that way. And as to feeding them his point waa good there, when he said to weaken it down. The chrysanthemums are very sensitive, when they come out in bloom, and by overfeeding them you burn up the petals. As to all the other parts, I endorse the whole paper. tMr. Dole: In the course of six or eight weeks after these plants are ted they do not require any manure. You will find this bottom is a i of roots, and they have received all the benefits from this bottom ure as well as what you have put on top. The Chairman: Mr. Henderson, I would like to ask you if you find it profitable to grow any big specimen flowers, that is from a commercial standpoint? I find my trade will consume a great many big flowers and pay a good price for them; but when I was at Omaha I saw the stock grown there was comparatively small, and the growers contended with me, some of them very violently, that there was no money in growing big chrysanthemums. I Mr. Frey: We have always found that a customer, if you set a med - and a large sized flower together at the same price, they will take large flower almost every time, and that flower will grow in the same n that small flower grows, by taking care of them the same way. I do not see why it would not sell as well as the small flower; it does i us. . We can not get the size and the finish the same on the small er. We have no trouble in disposing of the large ones; they are al - s the ones that are in demand. On the wholesale markets in the er cities, they always want the larger ones. For that reason ours always grown on a smaller plant where we can get from ten to fifteen era to a plant. The Chairman: I want to take another exception to your paper, an that is In regard to feeding. Our experience is that by feeding wi liquid we can control the feed better. We couple on our hydrant and g to work. Tou can make it just as weak or as strong as you want to the tank. We installed the system ourselves at a very light expense, am I believe with the florists that have nothing of that kind, it would be good idea to get it because it would save you an untold lot of hard, dis - agreeable work, and I am satisfied that we get better results. You ca get the feed to them when and where you want it, and just as weak o strong as you want it; and in fact in the spring you do not need to e pect to use but just an occasional watering. Iltr. Frey: Where do you have this tank located, high enough to give a pressure? The Chairman: No, we have a rotary pump, with a back pressure. </seg>
            <seg id="p083">83 It is simply made from an old globe valve, which I filed the threads off from, and we pipe it over the place. We throw off the clear water, and tljrow on the liquid manure pump. Mr. Frey: I hear so often about chrysanthemums being spoiled. As Mr. Henderson says, if you do not happen to be there and somebody hap - pens to be careless, it does not take much of an overdose to spoil the chrysanthemum, at the right time. Mr. Chairman: It is better to have too much than not enough; that is my experience. We can take the dumbest boy on the place, and he can go ahead and feed the roses by putting the hose in his hand, and saying, "Go ahead and soak them good." He can't go wrong; it's me - chanical, instead of expert work that is required. We start to feed "as soon as the buds show, and stop when they show color, and when we stop with the liquid we stop. We are done feeding when we discontinue the Mr. Dole: Would you advocate raised or solid benches? rlr. Frey: We used to grow in solid benches, but never got the suc - from them we did from the others. Mr. Dole: We do use solid benches with good success. We grow ours altogether in solid benches by themselves. In fact, we pulled down one bench to make a solid bench to grow them on. And the flower and the stem and the foliage were all that could be desired; in fact it was a revelation to some of the Omaha fellows. Mr. Henderson was there, and he can tell you it was good. tMr. Frey: That would make them practically the same if you had gh drainage in the bottom, for all of the superfluous water to drain LThe Chairman: Is there anything else you want to bring out on this ject before we pass it? tMr. Atkinson: In regard to the statement that the larger flower is more salable. There are quite a number of country florists with m the larger flower is not so desirable. Mr. Frey: If my trade demanded a larger flower, I would grow prac - tically all pot plants, since the profits would be the same practically from the same amount of room. The Chairman: Was there anything further? I would like to say one word. That is the reason I did not want to get up here — I want to do too much talking. Why grow a small flower in the bench, when you can grow a big one just as easily, and sell it a whole lot easier, and for the same money? So why grow a little one? There is not a customer anywhere that would not want to have a big flower at the same price. You can plant them the same distance apart, and you can get them any - where from a good sized up to a great big one just as easily as you can a little one. So why in the name of common sense grow a little one? Mr. Atkinson: There are a great many reasons for which a rosebud is better adapted to certain places, certain times, and certain conditions </seg>

The large one is almost too coarse to use in the coun sometimes even too coarse in the country. tMr. Chairman: That is a good point. But now say you are growing yellow chrysanthemum. Now why grow a Chadwick or a small Ap - &gt;n, when your customer would a great deal rather have a big one you can grow it just as easily? tr. Atkinson: I can answer that by saying that I think most of my ners would rather have a dozen medium sized chrysanthemums two large ones. kThe Chairman: Yes, sir, but wouldn't they rather have the same iber of large ones, instead of the same number of small ones, at the e price? I Mr. Atkinson: I believe, though, Mr. Green, that you will agree with that we have to have some of the smaller flowers? Mr. Green: Oh. yes, sir. fMr. Frey: You can get this dozen from one plant, and so there mid be no advantage in growing half a dozen or a dozen of them in a neb to get the same sized pot. At course they would naturally grow quantity of the large ones and small ones, that there would be a de - ind for, and try and even them as much as we could. Mr. Dole: We adhere to the cheaper trade to some extent. By grow - ing two stems from one root, we can then cut four flowers. Of course it took less disbudding to some extent and then we could sell those flowers at a cheaper price. Chairman: Now if there is anything else you want to ask Mr. ■jr now is the time. If not, we will have a paper on "Growing violets." W. A. Dole of Beatrice. GROWING VIOLETS. W. A. Dole, Beatrice. PROPAGATING.

BENCHING. The double violets, Marie Louise, are lifted the third week in Au - gust, the slender runners trimmed off and the plants benched inside. fJov. Herrick may be benched any time in September, but if you want early flowers on good length stems they should be benched before the middle of the month. They require a warmer temperature than other varieties and may be grown successfully in the cool end of a carnation house. We have grown Princess of Wales and Dorsett, which seem to be identical with each other. They bloom very freely in midwinter but the flowers and stems are smaller than those of Governor Herrick. Cali - fornia makes a long stem, but with us it does not bloom freely. SPACE BETWEEN PLANTS. Marie Louise is planted 9 inches apart each way. single varieties are spaced 10 x 12 inches. Plants summered in pots are more dwarf and may be planted closer. HOUSE BENCH AND SOIL. Our violet house runs north and south, though we have had equally good results in an east and west house. We use solid beds with sides two feet high, filled the full depth with good porous soil. When a crop is finished we take out tbe soil to a depth of five inches, put in one inch of cinders and use the bench during the spring for potted plants. During the summer we remove the cinders, put in one inch of rotted manure and Tour inches of soil, fork it over once, soak it down thoroughly, leave it till the weeds come up, then hoe oft the weeds, and it is ready to plant violets. For soil we have suc - ceeded equally well with old garden soil and with sod from blue grass pasture. TILLING AND PRUNING. During the fall the surface of the beds should be stirred frequently; the weeds and all diseased or dying leaves should be removed as fast as they appear. Trim the slender runners from the double violets. The single varieties sometimes grow a surplus of leaves, especially during </seg>

[When the plants are first set the beds should be thoroughly soaked, I if the leaves are disposed to wilt spray them several times daily un - wilting ceases. After this water only on bright sunny days, spray roughly to keep red spider from getting a start, and finish watering ly enough bo the leaves will get well dried off before night. The rio - is a remarkable consumer of water considering the low temperature which it is grown, and the soil should always be moist. TEMPERATURES. tA night temperature of 40 to 45 degrees suits most varieties, though ernor Herrick needs five degrees wanner. The day temperature lid be 55 to 60 degrees' on cloudy days, and 6 to TO on sunny days. VENTILATING. Ventilation should be freely given whenever the weather will per - mit, and in mild weather keep them slightly open all night. DISCUSSION. LMr. Chairman: Is there anything you would like to ask Mr. Dole on subject? A Member: Isn't 70 degrees rather a high temperature for violets? I Mr. Dole: It would be in midwinter, when you can keep it lower, the fall you can scarcely keep your house lower than that, and it would rather high. The Chairman: That would be a sun temperature, and not a steam temperatu/e? Mr. Dole: Yes, sir. In regard to your question of which is the most profitable, I have never kept a record, and could not answer that t Chairman: U there anything further you would like to ask Mr. ? You said that sod from blue grass pasture was good. You would take the fresh sod, would you? It is well rotted, I suppose? I Mr. Dole: No; it is ploughed up several months before so the sod Is rotted.

            <seg id="p087">HOW TO DESTROY INSECTS. 87 HOW TO DESTROY INSECTS AND FUNGOUS DISEASES ON GREEN - HOUSE PLANTS. C. H. Frey, Lincoln. Ery greenhouse man has bad his troubles with insects and disease his plants, as practically all plants are subject to disease or are )■ for insects; so then the price of good plants and flowers is eter - nal vigilance in combatting their enemies. Insects heading the subject we will mention a few that all are fa - miliar with. Take the aphis, or the green fly. This little fellow will tackle almost any plant, though, like us humans, has preferences and is especially fond of the rose, carnation, etc. Though one of the easiest to keep in check, this insect is found in almost every greenhouse, and, in - creasing so rapidly as he does, will, in a couple of weeks' time, have a village on every rose or carnation. Feeding on the sap by boring through the outer tissues, we can readily see what damage he can do in a short time. The method that I have been following for a number of years to de - stroy aphis is to spray with nicofume, two to four teaspoons to a gallon of water, using a Simplicity and a Paragon spray pump. We prefer the latter, though it takes two men to get over the place rapidly. Two men will go over the whole place in a few hours, and by having a certain time for this work, say Monday or Tuesday evening of each week, it is never neglected, and if your spraying or fumigating is done late in the afternoon the tenderest plant or flower will not burn. For such plants as cyclamen, or begonias in flower that we do not want to get moisture on, we paint steam pipes, using equal parts of nicofume and water. If the above rule is adhered to, green and black aphis, thrip and white fly will be a minus quantity. No doubt many s-till follow the old practice of burning tobacco stems, but the smell in the house next morning — the flowers, your clothes, in fact everything smells of tobacco smoke. Of course very few have any objection to tobacco smoke, but we don't like such large doses. Then there are stems scattered all over the walks, and probably a nice lot of heliotrope or some such tender plant ruined. k Going back again to insects, we must be on the lookout for black is whose especial diet is Queen of Autumn, though he can make a 1 on a daisy or a violet. Thrip. — This pesky little fellow can do more damage before we real - ize that he is in our midst than any insect the grower has to deal with, from the fact that he works under cover. How many times do we find our carnations marred from the ravages of thrip, in fact almost any flower and even the foliage are his legal prey; and once he becomes es - tablished it wilt take three or four fumigations each week from the first </seg>

A few strong; applications of nicotine, either sprayed ou foliage or painted on pipes, or better still, both methods applied at the same time, will hold them in check. kRed Spider, another of our friends, if we will call them such, will I on almost any plant, but is especially active in a hot, dry atmoe - e. The remedy here is a good sharp spray of cold water and if the handling the hose attends to business red spider will not thrive. Mealy Bug is not usually troublesome where the hose is handled properly, but on plants in bloom the best remedy we have tried was to go over each plant separately, and touch Mr. Bug on the back with a lit - tle grain alcohol. This may seem a flow way, but a man can go over hundreds of plants in a day, and once every two or three months will keep them clean. P:ale. — There are a number of species of these, but they usually hard-wooded plants, palms, etc., and are kept down with^the hose. with one or two overhaulings every season, will spoil their fun. tWocd Lice, Slugs, etc., will have to be poisoned and trapped, as these lly feed at night. A little Paris green will get them, especially the er. For slugs, lay pieces of turnip or cabbage around their haunts, you will find Mr. Slug hiding there in the morning. We have now talked about bugs and insects long enough, and will deal from this point with greenhouse plant diseases for a few minutes. Beginning with mildew, which is one of the hardest things the rose grower has to contend with, especially in houses where other plants be - sides roses are grown, but you can find traces of it in nearly every rose house, and the causes are many, viz., cold, draft, wet feet, or too dry feet, sudden changes in temperature, etc., all of which must be guarded against. After doing our best (of course, we all do that), we find mil - dew. Paint the heating pipes with sulphur, using moderation, or we will take all the color out of the buds and even drop the foliage. The fall and spring are the times mildew gets us, either before fires are started or after we quit firing. About the only thing to do then is to watch closely the watering and ventilation, and on a bright day, after swinging close the ventilators dust sulphur over the plants. The moisture causes it to adhere to the foliage. Let the temperature rise to 90 or 100 degrees for a minute, then begin gradually to reduce to what you carry the house at. Black Spot, another rose disease, is caused by too much moisture er on the foliage or at the root. Here again careful watering and ventilation is needed. Hybrid teas are the ones most susceptible to this disease. LClub Root, caused by a minute insect or worm, or whatever you may it, is another one of the many we have to contend with. I am led to believe by observation that if the plants are healthy when benched, and handled properly, you will have no trouble with eel worms. They are in moat all soils, and a hard check to a growing rose bush simply gives </seg>

And in the field by too deep planting, or some way in the house after planting, it is something to dread and something we must hold in check as far as it is possible. My remedy is to pull up all the plants at once, those that show any signs of stem rot, and bum or destroy them, and sprinkle air-slacked lime around those near by. Stigmoute, I believe, Is caused by too much water at the root and too humid an atmosphere. Some fourteen years ago I had a large lot left In the field after planting my houses, and about a week after we were through benching we had a week of cold rainy weather, followed by a few very hot bright days without a breath of air, and say, talk about stigmouse, spat, etc., there was not a leaf that was not affected on those outside, while those benched did not show any signs whatever, and I have noticed since that time that the same conditions will usually bring the same results. Rust. — This affects some varieties now and then more than others, but usually does not cause any trouble if care is used in syringing and watering. I have never found that there was any remedy that seemed to do any particular good. EBud Rot. — This is probably caused by too much water thrown over tiuds as the only places I have ever noticed it to speak of was where watering was done in a haphazard sort of way, and where they did take the proper precautions not to get too much water on the bud«. Violet Dicease or Spot is one on me, but I believe is caused from careless watering and lack of air, or good circulation of same, and know of no remedy save picking off the diseased leaves. Cyclamen Mite. — This is another trouble that there is little known about, but we know what it can do. As a remedy I would suggest that you should throw out all the affected plants. E,&gt; have taken up just a few insects and diseases, but I will atop here, and try to answer to the best of my ability any questions that &gt;e asked. DISCUSSION. The Chairman: Now, brother florists, this is one of the most Im - portant things that has come up this morning, and one of the great hand - icaps, in fact, one of the great reasons why the florists do not get rich Is on account of these diseases and insect pests, and it is a subject we can all learn something about. I would like to see a discussion brought out on one point particularly, and that is the white fly. I would like to hear from some of the brother florists. Mr. Frey: Of course cyanide will kill any insect in the greenhouse, for that matter.

            <seg id="p090">90 given it a trial, but I have found that where white flies have gathered very thick in some corner -where they have not been molested with the hose, that by taking about six teaspoonfuls of nicofume (that would be about 40 per cent nicotine), and spraying with about a gallon of water, and then painting the steam pipes with that or pure nicofume, that you can hardly find a fly.- And by following that up for a week, I do not be - lieve you will find a white fly in the house. Mr. Harrison: I would like to ask a queslion for the benefit of the ordinary home. Almost every householder has from three or four to a dozen rose bushes, and they have mildew and rust, and they have no remedy, and they do not know what to do, for they have no equipment. I was wondering if any one here knew of a simple remedy that would be The Chairman: Mr. Harrison wants to know about insects and fungous diseases on roses in the yard. Now there are people in private homes having roses or other plants in the yard that are affected that way. Is there any simple remedy you would suggest for their use that they can handle? Mr. Frey: About the only remedy for the mildew would be sulphur, or flower of sulphur. That would better be applied in the early morn - ing, when there is plenty of dew, when the sulphur would thus adhere to the foliage and stick on. Of course, once it gets a good start, and is es - pecially well seated — I have seen crimson ramblers that are literally faten up with mildew — and you ran hardly clean that up. And the same is true with any out-of-door roses, where it is well started. But if you are careful and notice the first signs of mildew and keep it down you can probably keep the plants very clean by using a little flower of sul - phur. And as far as insects outside are concerned, this nlcofame solu - tion is used, for it is a deadly poison, and would kill anything that feed* on the foliage. I have not at any time in my experience found an insect it would not destroy or kill. For the red spider I would syringe the plants from underneath. A nicofume solution used probably every ten days or once a week would keep them absolutely clean. tMr. Brown: I have used arsenate of lead, and I have used that prep- Ion on tea roses. It does not hurt the foliage, and it is always handy, yon can get lots of it. I use that on my plants. tThe Chairman: The next subject will be by your President and ent chairman and will be "Peonies for the florist." I have no paper, will merely Kive you all the information I have. PEONIES FOR THE FLORIST. C. H. Green, Fremont.

            <seg id="p091">91 Em for cut flowers. I took them up some eight years ago In order have a medium priced, showy, cut colored flower, for calls that we e in abundance for our Decoration Day business. This is one of the gest days the florist has in the year. The demand is much heavier a medium priced flower that will make a good- showing than at any er time of the year, and as peonies seem to fill the bill better than thing else, I first got 300 to start with. They were not named, but in irs they were pink, white, and red, and that was all the names I had them. I do not know the names of the varieties. I We planted them in the fall, and the next spring we did not get any wers to speak of. The following spring we got a big lot of flowers, bat ! found that it did not pay to grow anything that did not give a pretty Ir share of its blossoms before that time. So we got three hundred of a Offlcinallis varieties. They were white and pink and red. le red is the best of the lot, and while it is short stemmed, we find that there is a late season when the main crop or the standard varieties did t get into full crop, that the earlier blooming and smaller varieties help t materially. Last year we had 240 plants that were from four to five years old. lat is, we had them that had been planted and not disturbed for four five years. And then we had two or three hundred plants that were wo or three years established, and from that little block of ground, bout the size of this room, we sold over $300 worth of peony blossoms. hey not only were a good thing financially, but they helped us out so e did not have to turn down any orders, and if there is anything we hate do is to have some one hold out a dollar to us and be unable to get it tecause we do not have the flowers. It does not look like good busi - ess. Then in the fall we took up. 120 of these plants that had been tablished five years. We took up two rows of these and sold a little er $40 worth of stock, and we planted 420 plants. tThe $40 we got for these plants would pay for the cultivation and , ground rent for the entire block for the year, and for the replant - this new lot. We did not solicit any orders. I We got as hUh as fifty or sixty flowers from one plant. We have e light pink variety that we call Genevieve Lord, probably because it is not the name of it, but it is almost the identical shade of the rnation which you remember a few years ago by that name. And ten we divided those plants up, we just simply made dozens from one int. I did not keep any account of it at that time, but we found it in limited way very profitable. Now one of the main things we had to learn, and we have not finished learning it yet, or anything else in regard to them as far as that is coa - cerned, was how to have them at the right time. The main thing is to get an early start in the spring. As soon as the crop is cut in the summer time, we give it a heavy mulch of pretty well rotted manure and after - ward stirring the ground, and then they do not get any further care for the winter. </seg>
            <seg id="p092">92 f£&amp;riy in tn© spring, &amp;s soon jls tn© rrost is out of tbc ground W6 rake off all of the mulch carefully, and then we got over the ground and cultivate it with a five or seven-shovel cultivator. We loosen up the soil about the plants with a spading fork. That is all that is neces - sary to do to them until they begin to flower. Then we dis-bud them just as we would a chrysanthemum or a carnation, and after that we ■tart cutting the early varieties, usually about the 15th of May. The first ones we usually use for educating our trade, by dihplaying them in our windows, and giving them to the plant customers to get Ei into the notion that it is peony time. I work on that theory with santhemum time, carnation time, etc. It is a pretty good proposi - to keep that to yourselves, I would not say this out in public. We now sell quite a lot of peonies and make a nice thing out of it, before and even after Decoration Day. The lodges and fraternal or - ganizations will have their memorial days, and generally they use a big bunch of such flowers. As soon as the first petal uncurls or breaks away from the bud, we cut them a dozen in a bunch in the field, and tie them, keeping the buds even, and then take them into the house, and wrap an open newspaper right over the tops and put them into water. Now you can put them in jars or vases or anything that you please, and keep them in the cellar, without any cold storage, for ten days, and When you take them out they will be just in the form of a long pointed rose bud. Within a very few hours after you take them out, they are wide open, and it is wonderful to see the way they will open out after they have been in storage for three or four days in that way. In hand - ling them that way we lose very few, if any. In fact we do not lose any, because we did not sell directly, we used for advertising purposes. If a customer comes into the greenhouse and buys a bunch of flowers, or looks like he were going to buy later on, we give him a bunch of flowers. We have always found it is a legitimate advertisement. I would much rather distribute them, and let somebody have the pleasure of them, than to throw them away later on. I do not know of anything I can tell you about any further in this line unless there are some questions. DISCUSSION. Mr. Brown: How deep do you put them in the ground? Mr. Green: I should say two or three inches below the ground EIr. Yager: I would like to ask how you keep your peonies from ing back. Ours do and we are only half a mile away you. We begin to count our blossoms, and then there comes one of these late freezes, and we go out and find our crop more or lew frozen, and some of the early blooming varieties are very much harmed, and 1 want to know what you do. Mr. Green: Did you ever notice that you would find one variety all killed, and about ten feet away from that you will find another variety that was not hurt? </seg>
            <seg id="p093">93 Mr. Yager: Yes, sir. Mr. Green: We found that there were some very good varieties that were adapted for our purposes, and we have weeded them out now and have sold the sensitive ones to the nurserymen. I have disposed of th later blooming varieties at wholesale. There were some of these very beautiful, but they were too late, and therefore not profitable to me. But you will find that there are other varieties that will stand a good deal of freezing, and still come out in good shape. We had a hard frost on ours last year, and I thought we would not get anything, but they came out alright. Mr. Harrison: Did you ever try turning the hose on them before the sun comas out? Mr. Green: No. I never did, but it is a good idea, I think. Mr. Atkinson: If you fail to plant in the fall, would you wait until next spring? Mr. Green: If you can get plants that have been well stored over winter, I would plant in the spring by all means, because then you will get at least a partial crop the next year. QUESTION BOX. The Chairman: We now come to the question box, which I spoke about at the start of this morning's session. Are there any questions? Mr. Barnard: I would like to ask about pedigreed strawberry plants. I have a lot of them planted, and I do not know anything about them. I do not know what the pedigree, is. Of course I know what a pedigree is, but I would like to know what pedigreed strawberries are. Kellogg and other plant growers send out all these varieties and call them pedigreed, and now I want to say right here I do not believe in it. The meanest plants I have are called pedigreed plants. I do not think it is fair to the horticulturists of this state, because I do not believe they are selling anything of which a record is kept. Mr. Christy: Mr. Crawford, of Ohio, one of the best strawberry growers in the United States, took this matter up several years ago, and he sent to Mr. Kellogg and got some Warflelds from him, and I also sent him some out of my orchard, and I knew they were true Warflelds, and he also got some from Sarcoxe, Missouri, and a number of different places, and planted them. The ones that I sent down there, that had been cultivated on my place for twelve years, produced just as good as Mr. Kellogg's, and they were the same kind and variety, and his produced ■just as good as mine. So the pedigreed plants did not amount to very much, and were nothing more or less than ordinary plants with a phrase to catch the suckers. The Chairman: I find it necessary to appoint a Resolution Com - mittee, and as members of that committee, I have decided to appoint the following: C. H. Green, B. E. Fields, H. W. Marshall. </seg>

We have been told that we are right on the edge of an evolution in horticulture. We must take that into consideration. We have undoubt - edly along the eastern border of this state the very best apple growing region in the West.

As far as quality Is concerned, our Grimes Golden and Jonathan are unequaled in quality. Their Delicious, and all those varieties that they hold up as the best, the very best things that can be grown in the apple line, shrink into insignificance when compared to our Grimes Golden and Jonathan. Thus you can all see that there is no reason, with the soil to produce the best apples In the world, the keeping quality of the apples assured, that there is no reason why, if we all pull together and work hard, that we can not make the state of Nebraska one of the best apple-producing sections in the world.

Calls were here made for Mr. Barnard. Mr. Barnard: In the eastern part of the state we have not done nearly as much as we should have done. Compared to the Iowa orchards, and the Iowa fruit growers across the river, we have not done nearly as much as we should, and we should wake up, and I think at this meeting that we have done just what we should, and I want to congratulate the exhibitors upon what they have done. It is just what it should be, so if every fellow did not get the first premium it is because I did not have enough to go around. As far as the work of the society is concerned, 1 realize that we have a work before us, not only of the society and horti - cultural work, but we have a lot of laboring to be done with the legisla - ture and the agricultural board, and a lot of things that come in line with the Horticultural Society, and the Horticultural Society has to take E initiative and push it through, and as far as I am concerned I am ays willing to add my share to the work that is to be done.

Like every other great industry, horticulture had its beginning in </seg>
            <seg id="p097">97 to the luscious, magnificent fruits of today. Cultivation, crossing, graft - ing, and adaptation have given us the splendid varieties, and continuous experimenting has given us the knowledge of what localities are best suited to their production. But with all this the end was not reached; in fact, it was only the beginning, the ground work upon which to build the business of horticulture. In the first place we encounter the para - sites, the bugs and worms and moths that threaten and destroy the bet - ter part of our crop if steps are not taken to prevent them. Constant care, study, spraying, and cultivation are needed for this evil. Them we have the frost peril, but orchard heaters are invented for this, and there are other things too numerous to mention between the planting and pro - duction of perfect fruits. Put the fruit grower of today is not of the stuff that stops at ob - s or is discouraged by them. He likes his business and believes In determined to succeed and wants a fair return for his effort, and here we get to the real subject of this paper. The trend in horticulture, as in everything else, is towards speciali - zation. Growers find that to produce the best fruit In paying quantities requires such care and attention that they can not divide their time among too many kinds of fruit or too many varieties of one kind. Then, too, there is a growing tendency toward cooperation among growers of certain localities in the marketing of their product. There is a long gap between the producer and the consumer, and under modern business conditions this can only be bridged by such a combination of producers as will command the recognition in the markets as their product de - mands. But the most noticeable and significant tendency among up-to - date fruit growers is the broadening of their horizon by meeting with other growers and discussing and comparing results. The work of our State Horticultural Society is supplemented by this National Sot iety, and growers are coming in contact more and more with those engaged in the same business all over the United States. The pur - pose of these national meetings is not, as some might suppose, to help eloquent westerners to sell high priced land, but to educate us all in the producing and marketing of fruit, and the results after a very few yean are already quite manifest and apparent to all. At first, all of the prizes went to the western growers, who were more skilful in showing and exhibiting their product, but already Iowa growers have learned the lesson, and Iowa fruit from our own southweat - ern district is taking the prizes. This fall Mr. Worth, of Harrison county, took first prize at the Na - tional Horticultural Congress at St. Joe. Missouri, for the beet Jonathan apples, and J. W. Murphy took many ribbons at the Denver Apple Show. Nor is mere exhibiting the only end that has been accomplished by more general mingling with growers from all over the whole country. Better methods of tree culture and preservation are already In evidence, so that the whole tree may be made to produce uniform fine fruit, all mar - ketable and without blemish. * </seg>
            <seg id="p098">98 tAnd ao we have learned the greatest lesson of all, that we live In a Ion that need be second to none, and with proper methods at our inand and proper application of those methods we can make our fruit the place to which it is entitled In the markets of the world. Thus, by assuring a definite and profitable return on the capital and labor expended, make our country prosperous and more densely popu - lated with the best class of people engaged in the business, the best busl- M we know of. I But It takes a man who loves his work and devotes himself entirely it with a singleness of purpose that will not know defeat and has a at end in view, namely perfect fruit and lots of it. With our present Ilities and a great market accessible there is no reason to hesitate and i reason for failure, and success will be rewarded with an abundance t we do not even anticipate or at present realize. While we are making progress in the development of horticulture we need continual coaching to bring about the greatest results. k Horticultural societies, especially those supported by state appropria - have been the greatest promoters and are responsible for the prog - being made. Horticultural exhibitions have done much to create en - lasm, which means the enlargement and betterment of horticulture. tThus we are now better equipped, with the experience of the past to e us. We hardly give credit enough to the experimental work done by state colleges, but the tendency is to increase the interest in that line. tThis Central West is an agricultural country, but we must not forget : the demand for horticultural products is increasing every year, and have a soil and climate that, with proper attention, will produce proflt - &gt; crops in horticultural lines equal to any other part of the country. (The hill lands on either side of the Missouri river will produce abund - t and profitable crops of apples, grapes, raspberries, blackberries, and ler fruits. I speak of the lands along the Missouri river because there perhaps more of that character of land undeveloped than anywhere e In the state, that will in the course of time bring the greatest returns. We have made a great advance in the methods of marketing our crop. Council Bluffs nnd Omaha have an association whereby they handled last year's crops, mostly grapes and berries, the sales amounting to over $100,000. t While we have made a decided advance in the last twenty-live years, cations are that greater progress will be made in the future. We can, encouraging the development of horticulture, increase the wealth of state thousands of dollars, besides making possible the building of lerous beautiful homes on lands now unattractive and unprofitable. h rich, Inexhaustible soil no country has a greater possibility in this ■ction, and those who build their fortunes upon it are making the itest possible provision for the future. tThe President: Ladies and Gentlemen: Our friend Mr. Hess does live in this state, and he has come here from Iowa to give us this and has gone to considerable trouble, I am sure, to prepare this </seg>

He has given us a very practical talk on fruit growing in western Iowa and eastern Nebraska, and be has also brought out a very strong point when he said that everybody should belong to a horticultural society. That is a very important thing and should be impressed upon everybody. These societies are the means to an end. They are the places where we meet and have our discussions and give to one another the fruits of our latest experiences. They are the clearing houses of ideas for modern fruit culture, and they are the weapons we use and have to work with In this revolution that has been mentioned here, which is for the purpose of bringing about betterment in our fruit, both in its production and in its character. This point should be impressed upon everybody, and if there is any one here who does not belong to this society we invite them to join. The secretary will be glad to fix you out with membership at any time. The next number on this afternoon's program, will be the "Cost of orchard management," by Prof. R. F. Howard, of the University of Ne - braska Experiment Station. COST OF ORCHARD MANAGEMENT. Prof. R. F. Howard, University of Nebraska. To figure out a system of orchard management for Nebraska condi - tions, laying down rules to be followed, and stating just what each, phase of the work should cost would be as ridiculous as it would be impossible to do. Owing to the diversified condition under which orchards are grown in this state alone, would make this quite impossible. The methods that would give best results with one grower might prove entirely unsuitable to other growers who were working under different conditions. When figuring on the cost of orchard management in Nebraska, one must have Imind that, in addition to the necessity of using different methods to t local needs, the cost of any given system will vary with the conditions under which it is operated. Even under a given set of conditions, when it is possible to approxi - mate the cost of pruning, cultivating, spraying, etc., it would probably be very misleading to say what it costs to grow a bushel of apples. The variations in yield from year to year would render such a statement use - less if based upon the results of a single season. For this reason, in giving figures of cost, I wish to state clearly the condition as they exited in this particular orchard last season, and have it-understood that these figures are the results of one season's work only. I hope to have the management of this orchard in charge for a series of years, and I intend to keep every item of expense booked. At the end of five or ten years I should be able to deduct cost figures from the data thus taken that will be fairly accurate for the particular conditions as they exist in this or- </seg>
            <seg id="p100">100 NKHKAKKA STATK HORTK'lI.TlIt AI, BOCIKTY middle of Otoe county. It consists of about 1,000 trees, planted on twenty - three acres. The trees are eighteen years old, and, owing to the excep - tionally good care they received while young, there are probably not more than a doien trees missing in the entire orchard. The land slopes gently to the west with still lower land beyond. The soil is not very rich and parts of it has sand stone coming very near the surface. It is planted to the following varieties with the rows running east and west; 300 Beu Davis, 300 Missouri Pippin l'tn Jonathan, andd 300 Winesap. The trees were given systematic cultivation until they were ten years old and it has been in grass and clover since that time un'.il last spring. COST OK PRUNING. The trees had not been wholly neglected prior to this time with re - spect to being pruned, but they were iu need of a moderate thinning out in order to get them in a condition so the sun could penetrate the most inner parts of the top, and in order that a good job of spraying be made possible, it was necessary to remove probably a dozen branches the sizo of one's arm and smaller, beside* the water sprouts from each tree. tTbe tost of giving these trees such a pruning was 15.8 cents per . This included hauling the brush from the orchard. Hand labor $1.50 per day, andd $3 per day for hand labor plus a team. COST OF SPRAYING. PThe first spraying was given with commercial lime-sulphur alone just ire the flowers opt-ned. It was applied with a power outfit with three s of hose. The second application was made at the usual time for second spraying with lime sulphur plus lead arsenate. The third ap - plication was made about three weeks later with lime-sulphur plus lead arsenate on the Missouri Pippins and Jonathans and lead arsenate alone on the Winesaps and Ben Davis. The July spraying was omitted owing to the drouth that threatened the crop at that time, but the cost is figured on the basis of a fourth application of lead arsenate alone, the cost of the third spraying being as a basis for this estimate. The water had to be pumped by hand and hauled about a quarter of a mile. Pcost of materials, including gasoline for making these four spray 12 cents per tree, and the cost of labor amounted to 14.2 cents making a total cost of 26.2 cents per tree for the four applica- COST OF CULTIVATIONS. Ewas necessary to plow about one-third of the orchard where the is thickest. The remainder we were able to work up with a disk t plowing. The ground was disked six times during the summer rrowed three times at a cost of 5.2 cents per tree. </seg>
            <seg id="p101">101 COST Or HARVESTINlj AND "AOtvlNU, Both men and women were employed in harvesting the crop. The women were paid $1.15 per day, and the men $1.65 per day. Some of the experienced packers received $2.50 and $3 per day. The pickers were re - quired to hand pick everything and place it into bushel baskets under the trees. From here the baskets were hauled on a spring wagon to the pack - ing shed, where four men were kept busy sorting and packing. The yield was 2,316 bushels or 2.1 bushels per tree. The cost of handling the fruit from the trees until it was packet! iuto barrels was $340.61. This reduced to smaller units means the cost of harvesting amounted to 30.1 cents per tree, or 14.3 cents per bushel. When these figures are grouped and reduced to the basis of a tree, we get the following: When we figure that the yield was 2.1 bushels per tree, ft cost 36.3 cents per bushel to grow this crop, and put it into barrels. E These figures are probably somewhat higher than they would be on average year, owing to the fact that the Winesap trees averaged lew D a bushel per tree last season. DISCUSSION. K Howard: If there are any questions that any one wishes to ask, iBwer them as best I can. ■The cost did not include the cost of barrels or of hauling it to the I A. No. Q. What was the cost of picking and packing? EL 30.1 cents per tree, or 14.3 cents per bushel. That is pretty high, crop this year was rather small und stunted by the drouth, and it thin on the Winesap trees, which made the cost of harvesting more it would have been otherwise. Q. Did your lime sulphur control the fungus? A. Yes, sir. Q. Did you have any bad effects to the foliage by that treatment of lime sulphur? Q.

            <seg id="p102">102 Was there any difference in that that you used with the arsenate of lead ■praying, and that that you used with the lime sulphur? A. That would only be in the third application, and I will say we noticed no difference. Q. How late did you cultivate? A. Up until about the 8th of August. I think the last cultivation was harrowing in tome cow peas. Q. Was there crop enough to pay? A. Hardly. Q. Where is that orchard? BA. About the central part of Otoe county, six miles south and west Unadilla. Mr. Yager: Referring for a second, if you will allow me, to what was given in the talk by Mr. Hess, I am sure we are all very much pleased with his paper, and with his talk, and I am sure that our society always appreciates these talks and papers by outsiders, and therefore I move that Mr. Hess be made an honorary member of this society. A Member: I move to amend the motion as just made and add "that a vote of thanks be given to Mr. Hess for his paper. Mr. Tager: I accept the amendment. Seconded. Carried. Mr. Hess: I thank you, and wish to apologize as to the statement I made that the Central West was behind in this experimental work. I wish to say that I have some information lately in regard to the state of Pennsylvania. The state of Pennsylvania has been rather backward in taking hold of this scientific horticulture, and the result was they lost a great many of their trees, and the apples they raised were hardly fit to put upon the market, but the state expended some money and did just such experimental work as the professor was doing in different parts of the state with wonderful results. They are now producing apples which they claim shall be and are superior to the apples that are grown in Col - orado, Idaho, and Washington. But be that as it may, we have our own responsibility here in our own country, and we are going to take care of the Central West, and I am sure that the enthusiasm which I see here today will sustain me in the contention that we are beginning to wake up to the real work that is before us. We have as good a chance here to do the work that they do in the states so widely advertised as apple - growing states. We have a good rainfall, and do not have to irrigate. We have a better climate, and a better soil. We are closer to good mar - kets, and we have proven our worth as an apple-producing section, and with such work as the professor is doing it will not be long until we can make a showing with any of them. (I wish to thank you for the honor you have conferred upon me, and &gt;e that if there is anything of value in my paper it may do the good it Intended for. Mr. Harrison: The next number on our program is Number Two, "Quality of the Nebnuka Apple," by Val Keyser of Lincoln. </seg>
            <seg id="p103">QUALITY OP NEBRASKA APPLES. 103 QUALITY OF NEBRASKA APPLES. Val Keyser, Lincoln. In discussing this subject the writer has no apology to make for Ne - braska apples. That we can produce apples in Nebraska of superior quality is a question over which there is no chance for argument. tin order to deal fairly with this subject I wish to state that by qual - ! mean, first flavor, second texture, third color, and fourth keeping ity — on the ability of the apple to stand up In storage, on the mar - or in the hands of the consumer. Apples produced in Nebraska are good, it makes no difference whether you measure them by the barrel or the box or in bulk. Ne - braska has a soil which contains the elements essential to the production of apples equal to those grown anywhere in the world, and which enables the production of better quality than many sections of the country, far more notorious, for apple growing. Mother Nature has likewise been more generous with climatic con - ditions, moisture, and sunshine, heat and cold, and other factors which measure climatic conditions and which work in harmony with the prop - erties of the soil in fixing desirable qualities in our apples. That these things are literally true no rational mind would attempt to defy. We have proven our assertions by producing the fruit. Many apple growers, perhaps we had better say many people who attempt to grow apples, have labored under the delusion that fruit at the highest standard of excellence can be produced by planting a tree and leaving it to care for itself. In this respect we must all feel a sense of guilt, for it is only recently, within the past ten years, that we have been able to put upon the market with certainty apples which prove Nebras - ka's real worth in the production of this fruit. It is true that in the early history of orcharding in Nebraska fruit equal in quality to the best speci - mens grown today was produced. The fact that such splendid apples could be grown with the exercise of to little care on the part of the grower later proved to be an unfortunate condition of affairs. The climate did not change to any great extent, nor did the soil un - dergo any material changes. In many respects trees grow as well today or better than they did forty years ago, and yet in order to produce fruit equal in quality to that of the early growing it requires the exercise of the most intelligent care and cultural methods. Nebraska growers are unfortunate in assuming that because high quality fruit was produced In the early days without any special care that those conditions would remain unchanged, and while sleeping on that assumption they failed to awaken to see the ravages of insect ene - mies and dangerous plant diseases, which depreciated the quality, dis - couraged the grower, and greatly injured the reputation of Nebraska's apples. All sort of theories were advanced by experienced orchardlsts In feeble attempts to explain the status of the apple-growing business la </seg>
            <seg id="p104">104 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Nebraska. The general opinion prevailed that many varieties that were once so highly commendable had fallen by the wayside, degenerated, and only two tbinga remained to be done. One was the origination of the new varieties suited to Nebraska's ever-changing climatic conditions. The other to move the trees to a country better suited to apple produc - tion. While the result of these conclusions brought forth the introduc - tion and origination of many new and valuable varieties, it also had the effect of driving from Nebraska's fertile glacial drift and loose soils hun - dreds of people who arc now producing fruit in the volcanic ash of the western states. Those who have left the state to pioneer in horticulture are at pres - ent flooding our markets with apples, beautiful in appearance, but miser - ably inferior in texture, flavor, and keeping qualities. tNow that we have solved the problems of producing high-class ap - , it is up to us to face a market condition which can only be done by hing the consumer the difference between two things: general ap - pearance and real quality. In dealing with the question of quality of Nebraska apples, we may be able to come to a better understanding by the use of a few concrete comparisons. By making these comparisons we do not wish to reflect discredit on any individual, community, or state. Our ideal is to boost the apple business and 'to educate the consumer until there is a general appreciation of the difference between high-class and ordinary fruit. Be - cause Mother Nature has seen fit to make conditions in Nebraska ideal for the production of apples of superior quality, it would certainly be unjust to blame any individual or community who were fortunate enough to own these lands. E; most encouraging thing concerning the fact that we can produce of high quality is that the factors which play a part in the pro - of our apples are permanent. It has been clearly demonstrated that it is our soil and climatic conditions which determine the quality of Nebraska's apples. Hereditary tendencies in the evolution of varieties are not respon - sible for the difference between Missouri river and western grown varle- The same varieties taken from the same nursery stock shipped to Colorado, Idaho, and other western states and planted on those soils in - variably produce fruit of inferior quality. ■i investigation of this subject shows that large shipments of apple From Stork Bros., of Missouri, and Youngers tc. Company, from Ne - l. have been planted in the mountain states, and the same varieties those nurseries used in orchard planting in Nebraska invariably produce fruit of superior quality. During the past few years western grown apples from the states of Colorado, Idaho, Utah, and Washington have been consumed by Nebras - ka's people in immense quantities. Not merely a few boxes but by car - loads by the hundreds of carloads they have been shinned into the niar </seg>
            <seg id="p105">105 that they were largely composed of varieties which can be grown In our own state. We find the following varieties represented in these ship - ments: Winesap, Jonathan, Gano. White Winter Pearmaln, Grimes Gold - en, Missouri Pippin, Arkansas Black, Lawver, York Imperial, and Rome Beauty. Of course we also find a limited number of Newton Pippin, Delicious, and Stamen Winesap, and quite a large shipment of Spitzenberg. The point that the writer wishes to clinch is that Nebraska can pro - duce and does produce apples of the same varieties above mentioned, with the possible exception of Newton Pippin and Spitzenberg, which are of much better quality than the western grown apples. By better quality we mean that Nebraska's apples have a finer texture, more pal - atable flavor, and that they retain these qualities through the markets to the consumer. Perhaps it is true that fruit from the West, one year with another, can be made to take on a more attractive color, though the writer is not prepared at present to even concede this point. When Nebraska's orchards are properly pruned, the trees headed to admit free access of air and sunshine; when Nebraska's apple trees are properly sprayed with a liberal use of lime sulphur; when Nebraska's orchards are properly cultivated so that the moisture conditions for growth and development of the apple are more nearly under the control of the grower; when the fruit buds of the apple trees in Nebraska's or - chards are protected] by the intelligent use of orchard heaters; and when Nebraska orchardists learn to select and grade and to give their apples decent care in harvesting and marketing, it is doubtful If the western states would be able to excel in a single character of the many which compose the quality of our apples. It is interesting to note that at least a dozen of our apple growers have observed the necessary steps in the practice of orchard manage - ment, as outlined above. These men have brought the fruits of their own raising from orchards handled under up-to-date methods. We are making an exhibit today for our society which is the result of our efforts during the past season, and I wish to state that those apples on exhibition over at our fruit show contain some of the linest specimens ever produced in the United States. We have always been able to produce specimens which did excel in flavor and texture; this year we have the color. It will also be interesting to 'note in studying our exhibition of fruit that we are able to produce the size and uniformity. Our fruit show is open to the public; it is the intention of the Society to make this educational. If we could only reach a small per cent of the consumers of apples in Nebraska, if they could be brought here to view this beautiful exhibit, and, better still, if they rould be allowed to taste and compare the quality of Nebraska apples with those grown in the western states, the thinking public would command the apple growers of Nebraska to put this fruit within their reach. </seg>
            <seg id="p106">106 I Gentlemen, I believe we ought to feel a sense of duty in this matter furnishing apples to the consuming public of our state. There is no ad reason why Nebraska's people should eat apples of inferior quality, ten here in Nebraska we have the toil and climatic conditions which. given a fair chance to show what they can do, will produce fruit of perior flavor, texture, oSor, color, size, and all of the characters which ike up quality in apples. t Nebraska's Jonathan, Grimes Golden, Winesap, Rome Beauty, York wial, White Winter Pearmain, and Black Twig furnish a variety of ares, flavors, odors, colors, sizes, and shapes which ought to satisfy numerous tastes, likes and dislikes of the average community. (The writer has purposely avoided in the foregoing discussion of ap - saying anything about Nebraska's Ben Davis, because Nebraska's Davis can stand alone and on its own merits.- In comparing it with es of the same variety, grown in the West, it is outstanding much rior. In fact, I believe that Nebraska Ben Davis, when properly m, is a better eating apple than many of the high-class eating apples le western states. We have never advertised our Ben Davis as de - &gt;le apples to eat out of the hand, but we can and do grow plenty of rs for that purpose. But the old and much abused Ben Davis has a er place among our varieties. It will stand alone and take care of r. The women, the cooks, will keep the Ben Davis on the market. A study of the Ben Davis apple as we find it on the markets of our state show that two tnings .have been largely responsible for discrediting this valuable variety. First, the fact that the Ben Davis commenses to color at an early stage in its development leads many of the small and inexperienced growers to assume that it is ready to harvest in early September. Consequently, a number of green, immature Ben Davis ap - ple* are thrown upon the market, while they are in condition wholly unfit for human food, while in the average season this apple should not be picked from the trees before the middle of October. The second reason why so much discredit has come to the Ben Davis is the fact that so many growers do not exercise proper care in handling and marketing. The apples are bruised and jammed and generally abused, until the flesh of the fruit be-, naath the skin turns brown, becoming tough, unattractive, and unde - sirable for use, while the texture of the Ben Davis will stand abuse In handling better than many other varieties. Its value on the market and to the consumer is greatly reduced by careless methods of handling. To verify the many assertions concerning the quality of Nebraska's apples the writer imposed upon the good nature of some of the leading commission merchants of a few cities along the Missouri river, where Nebraska apples have been handled for twenty years. In answer tc a brief list of questions concerning the keeping qualities of Missouri river apples, all of the commission merchants agreed that Nebraska apples, properly grown and handled, would keep as good as apples from any part of the United States. A few ventured the assertion that apples crown in the same territory along the Missouri river would keep better than </seg>
            <seg id="p107">107 tsame variety grown in Colorado and Idaho, and would stand up longer the market after coming from storage. In answer to the question which referred to the comparison of flavor and texture of Missouri river apples and the same varieties from Colo - rado and Idaho these men were unanimous in the opinion that apples grown along the Missouri river were much superior to these others in these respects. One commission merchant from Lincoln who has had long experience in handling apples in all parts of the United States gave it as his opinion that the reason why Nebraska apples excelled in flavor was because the apples in this section of the state grew and developed under more natural conditions. That irrigation was a forcing process, and interfered with the function of the tree in the proper development of quality in the apples. tA commission merchant from St. Joseph, Missouri, was of the opinion t the soil was the greatest factor in determining quality in apples, •se statements serve to verify the assertions of the writer. While It ild be interesting for us to know just what factors present in Nebras - i soil and climatic conditions enabled the production of apples of bet - quality than can be grown in many of the far-famed fruit sections of West, we are more interested in the fact that we have these ideal ditions and that it is up to apple growers of Nebraska to put our state the map as one of the greatest apple-producing sections of the world. I Now all that is necessary to accomplish this end is for more people become interested in commercial apple growing, that we may be able supply not only the markets of our state but to treat our friends in er states to some of the good apples Nebraska can produce. DISCUSSION E. M. Pollard: I do not feel that this matter should be passed over this form. Every member of this Society who has been growing Ne - raska fruit on a commercial scale knows that every bit that Mr. Keyser as said is the absolute gospel truth so far as the quality of Nebraska ap - es is concerned. And it seems to me — this thought occurred to me hile Mr. Keyser was on the floor — that it is a shame that there axe so many apples coming into Nebraska from states that do not and can not roduce fruit that will rank in quality with our own, and the thought occurred to me that possibly something might be done by this Society the way of spreading information as to the real quality of our fruit mong our own people. Now I do not just know how that should be gotten at, and I do not know just what methods should be followed, but that thought occurred to me, and it seems to me it is one of the most important things we have before us, that is, those of us that are engaged in raising fruit on a com - mercial scale. It is important to us, and I am going to move you, Mr. President, that a committee of three be appointed by the president to take up this matter and Investigate it, and report tomorrow if they </seg>
            <seg id="p108">108 fcl and if they can not, at tbe next meeting. I will make that mo Seconded. Carried bMr. Williams: I would like to say a word about advertising in Ne - ■ka. It is a large proposition. It requires a live working rommittee, tbe committee should be continued from year to year. I want to say this: that one efficient way of advertising resources would be to publish very freely such papers as Mr. Keyser has read, and want to ask Mr. Keyser that this paper be handed to the State Journal. think it is a pretty good medium for advertising and publishing papers of the society. I was in the office this morning and they asked me to land in any particular papers of interest. They want to get them, and it will be of great value to the orchardists of this state. Then a word while I am on my feet about the apple industry. I just returned from Mills county, Iowa, my old home, and I was able to meet a professional packer there, who has been in that region for twenty-one years, and he told me that out of the twenty-one years, there had been but one failure of the crops. The past year was one of the best yean. The packers of that county, who number about half a dozen, packed in that county alone 200,000 bushels of apples, and the average price, I think, that was paid, was about $2.25 a barrel. This packer told me he paid $14,000 for the product of one orchard of seventy acres. Now it occurs to me there are hundreds of acres on this side of the river, and we in Nebraska have similar soil and condition, and I want to stand up for Nebraska and advertise its resources, for we can do tbe same thing here that those folks can do over there. A Member: I would like to ask the writer of the paper if he com - pared tbe quality of our apples with the New York and eastern apples. tMr. Keyser: No, I did not. My intention here was to show the erence between the apples we were up against on the market and the d that should be on the market. The eastern apples, you will have to e it to them in some respects. They are just as good as we have in ■one respects, but I would not for one minute admit they are any better. E. M. Pollard: At the time of the St. Louis Exposition I was in rharge of the horticultural exhibit of this state. There we had an op - portunity to compare the apples grown in every state in the Union, and I think several of the territories at that time, and I know it was the universal verdict of the judges who judged the apples from the various states, variety for variety, grown over the country, that the quality of the apples grown in this latitude running clear across the Atlantic Ocean, that there was hardly any difference. Of course, you understand that the apple is at home in a cold climate. You put it in a warm climate and it takes away from its quality. I will say that a few years ago the Univer - sity made a very careful study of the quality of the apples In Nebraska with those grown in New York and the other eastern state. I am sorry that the Chancellor of the University is not here, he could give us some very valuable information on this question My best recollection of the </seg>
            <seg id="p109">109 and the Winesap, etc, ran equal to, if not superior to the Greening and apples of that kind grown in New York and other eastern states. t Secretary Marshall: We have in our ojflce a silver medal given at e Centennial Exposition at Philadelphia in 1876 for the collection of apples of the best quality, and it was won by Nebraska. So that must Kicate that we hare quality, and we were at that time competing with eastern state*. The Chairman: I would like to hear from Mr. G. A. Marshall about his apples. Mr. G. A. Marshall: We have been selling our apples to a Chicago firm for the last two years, and we could not agree on the price last summer when the buyer was there, and so he went away. I contended that the price was going up. and you know it finally came down. Later we got a telegram from him that he was coming back here, and I knew what that meant, because we had not made any price to him before. Then he came back, and we made him n proposition, and he accepted it. He had bought apples in different sections and I asked him why he came back to Nebraska when he could buy elsewhere cheaper. "I tell you," he said, "from March on we have to have an apple grown in the Missouri river country if we do not want to repack." He said the Missouri river apple is the best keeper they buy. This is one of the biggest firms in the United States, and they have been in the apple business since I have lived here, anc| I thought that was saying a good deal for our apples. And another thing he told me. they shipped our Ben Davis into the various markets in Ohio, where we have been told they would not eat our Ben Davis, and he said they have a good trade there. Our orchard is more than half Ben Davis, so more than half the apples he buys of us are Ben Davis. Of course it is just as Mr. Keyser told us, they have to have the Ben Davits. If we had more Jonathans, and Grimes Goldens, and Winesaps we could get a better price for them. But you don't find them turning down the Ben Davis. And another thing about the quality of the Ben Davis. When we give a New York man a Jonathan we will swell right up while he is eat - ing it because we know he likes it; when we give him the Grimes Golden we swell up bigger than ever. We do not care whether or not he is from Michigan or New York. But when we give him the Ben Davis, — well, the Ben Davis is not 'an apple to eat out of the hand, but for cooking they have a place you can't take away from them. It is the evener of all the apples. It is the apple that the common people should bow down on their hands and knees and be thankful to. Why? Because it is the one apple that keeps the price of apples from going so high that nobody but John D. Rockefeller could afford to eat Two or three years ago we were going down east, and we looked into the apples that were in the markets of Chicago. Then we went to Buf - falo, and looked there. Then we went on to New York and I found more </seg>
            <seg id="p110">110 Ben Davis on the market than all the others together, and when we got clear down to Boston, where they had palates so educated to Boston baked beans, and all those other high-toned things they still had Ben Davis apples. Why, we just can not run them out of the market. One of the leading nurserymen in the United States told me the other day that he had more Ben Davis packed than any other tree, and he says that he was going to back them. The packers of our crop were from Michigan and they had some Ben Davis apples that they were going to pack, and their barrels did not come, so they did not have anything to pack them in, and we piled others on top of them, and when we got down to them three weeks later the packers did not know what they were. They brought a Gano to me, and said, what have you mixed with the Ben Davis, and I looked at it and said, it is a Gano, and he said it is not. Look here, he says, you can run your finger through them, and they are in fact good to eat. And I looked at it, and saw it was a sweat ripened Ben Davis. Those Michigan fellows said they never ate Ben Davis before that the; liked. Mr. Swan: About six years ago my first crop came on, and I had been up through the Northwest, and there was not a parson that wanted our apples; they all' seemed to think they must have Michigan or New York apples. Later there was a gentleman came out from Chicago who wanted to see our apples. I said, how are the other apples In comparison with these? He told us that they were good. And we talked a long time about prices and tried to agree on a price and finally he said, "I will take two thousand barrels of these apples at a dollar and seventy-five cents on board cars, and you can ship them to Chicago." I told him he could hare them, but I did not think there would be that many. I thought there should be about 900 bushels. And so I shipped them to Chicago. kNext February my son had occasion to be in Chicago, and I told him re be left to step around to that commission house and find out how e apples were selling. So my son went down to the commission house, and said how are Winesaps gelling, and the commission merchant gave him a certain price, and then he asked him about the quality, and he told him they were fine. He asked them where they were raised, and they told him in Nebraska, and then he asked them if he could see them. He said they can not raise any good apples in Nebraska, he told him he was from the West and he knew what he was talking about, and that they could not raise any good apples in Nebraska. Well, they told him to come and see them, and so my boy went to see them and he knew as soon as he saw them that they were my apples, and he looked them all over, and they were good. He then asked how much they was getting for them, and they told him that they was getting $6.50 a barrel. What do you think of that? K Chairman: The next paper will be by Mr. Frank G. Odell of on "Horticultural observations in the northwest" </seg>
            <seg id="p111">HORTICTLTURE IN THE NORTHWMrT. 111 HUKTICULIUHAL OBotRVn I IUNO IN I rife PIUnlHWEOI. Frank G. Odell, Lincoln. I have been asked by your secretary to relate to this meeting some of the horticultural observations of a wandering Nebraskan in the North - west, that far-famed land where the crop of apples is exceeded only by the annual crop of "suckers" who fall under the spell of the boomers in the land of the Golden Sunset. Let me preface this quite informal talk with the frank confession that I returned from my first trip to the Spokane country some four yean ago fully as enthusiastic over that country as the average tourist. A week in constant attendance at the first National Apple Show, where one ate, drank, talked, and dreamed of apples, left little time for real Inves - tigation, such as has been afforded in later and more extensive Journeys into the "scenic land of fortune," as it is dubbed in the literature of the Jim Hill railroads. I have revised to some extent my views of the Northwest as a profit - able opening for Nebraska citizens. In reaching these conclusions I be - lieve that my judgment has not been entirely partial. Though for nearly thirty years a resident of this state, it has not always been kind to me. It has fallen to my lot to have quite the average of the troubles Incident to human existence; sometimes I have thought that more than my share had slipped over my way. The occasional cold winters which we have here do not awaken my enthusiasm, and I have always had a craving for the mountains and the life of the wild. Many times my mind has been fully made up to leave Nebraska and seek a more congenial clime. I can now see that adverse fortune has really been kinder than I thought, and that which seemed my misfortune in detaining me in this state has brought in these later years that richest of blessings, — contentment and realization of the value of those friend - ships of the passing years which come to a man but once in a lifetime. Eir these reasons, which have become in my later years the most ful, it is my chief desire that this little talk lead your thought as has been providentially led, in the paths which make for real hap - i and content. Very fortunately for most of us, these things do not always necessarily companion with worldly prosperity. As most of you know, my horticultural knowledge (if it may be dig - nified by such a term) is largely technical; such as one gathers from the reading of books and association with the people who really do the work; hence my observations fchouM not be taken as by any means conclusive or as emanating from one who speaks with authority. Indeed, one must needs be careful what one says, for quite recently in my zeal for the de - velopment of our own state I ventured to print some facts given me by my good friend, your capable secretary. Some of my friends congratu - lated me, and I secretly congratulated myself, on having really don* a capable bit of newspaper work; but to my chagrin a letter came from a </seg>
            <seg id="p112">112 in Colorado, who assures me gravely that my figures are all wrong ana that we can not raise apples profitably in the state of Nebraska. The only reply I could make was to lay the whole thing on Mr. Marshall and invite my critic to attend this meeting. I sincerely hope he is here; in which case it will be my endeavor to let him hear some things that will be good for what ails him. I scarcely think it worth while to waste time in arguing the question of Nebraska's ability to raise apples of marketable value at a satisfactory profit, when we have this last season, according to the reports published in Better Fruit, the organ of the northwest growers, grown and marketed more apples than the state of Washington. The important thing at this time is that we show to the outside world as well as to our own people the potential value which lies awaiting the touch of trained intelligence and willing hands in the future orchards of the state of Nebraska. There are some things about the people of the Northwest which awaken my sincere admiration. One is their public spirit I had occa - sion late last September to lake a roundabout journey from Pendleton, Oregon, by the way of Walla Walla, Washington, up the Columbia river to Paseo, in order to catch a main line Northern Pacific train for North Yakima. A good portion of this little journey lay through the unsettled country back of the Columbia river on the edge of Oregon and across the river in similar country in the state of Washington. There are no moun - tains there with their fascinating beamy, and a more desolate and gen - erally God-forsaken country it has never been my misfortune to look upon. We stopped at a flag station where an abandoned freight car served for a depot. Up the slope from the railway stretched a wilder - ness of sand, hub-deep to the wagons that followed the toiling horses. E brush and grease-wood everywhere. Not a tree In sight. But along - he track was a forty-foot sign board, twenty feet high, advertising SE CHOICE ORCHARD LANDS— »3&lt;&gt;0.00 PER ACRE ANJi UP." Ed that commands my admiration. It takes "some class" to promote 1 of sand that was worth fifty cents an acre but yesterday, and to for $300 an acre today. NOT A POOR MAN'S GAME. I submit that the orchard industry in the Northwest is no longer a poor man's game. Permit me to reprodupe here a portion of one of my recently, published letters from this country. "They talk apple lingo out here in the jargon of the plutocrat. In - cidentally they have some few apple trees now growing; the report of Commissioner Huntley fot the year 1911 shows that there are over 7,000. - 000 apple trees in the state of Washington, and they are still planting. Presently they will have enough so we can all have an apple apiece any- "If outward signs count for anything, the orchardist is not unduly </seg>

When questioned he will frankly' admit that the average man is hard up, and that there is no immediate prospect of relief until the country shall have experienced its quadren - nial salvation at the hands of the politicians and the captains of finance. It matters little whether this condition be natural or artittlicial; Its pres- ence is too manifest to be comfortable." CAPITALIZING HOT AIR. C'lt does not require much probing to reveal the fact that the profits of arding in the northwest have been exaggerated to the detriment of the country. I had a most interesting conversation with a onetime member of the faculty or the Washington State Agricultural College touching this point. He admitted frankly that the Ananias Club has a large and active membership in the Northwest, quoting as a typical case that of a. Wenat - chee orchardist who produced 1,200 boxes of apples from seven acres of five-year-old trees. This was heralded far and wide as a sample of the average yield in this wonderland, and the phenomenal story started an In - vestigation by the horticultural department of the college. My friend, the professor, verified the story of the yield and also that the grower Sold his seven-acre crop for $2,400 at the orchard. "Bear in mind, please, that these were five-year-old trees. Apple trees are very precocious under irrigatiou. This orchardist might reason - ably expect this crop to increase, year by year, — but, bless you, — no. The next year it fell from 1,200 to 300 boxes, showing once more that it is not wise to count chickens before they are hatched or apples before they grow. The 1,200-box story received due publicity in railroad publications, real estate literature, and the newspapers. This is probably the first time the 300-box story has been told, and would not have now appeared but for the Inquisitive faculty which 'dug it out' of the professor." "This should not be taken as conclusive that apple growing is not profitable in the Northwest; it is profitable in many instances, but 'cum grano salis.' Have your salt-cellar ready and handy when those areragQ stories of phenomenal crops are related in your hearing. I have been play - ing the role of an animated interrogation point all over the Northwest and have thought it prudent to ask questions of the people who. own and operate the orchards rather than of the real estate agents." "The general result of this first-hand investigation is to develop the fact that the reports of thousand-dollar-per-acre crops must be divided by three to strike the average of lean years, insect pests, and occasional mistakes in management. Against this reduced total must be charged expense of management, maintenance charge for water, cultivation, spray - ing, heating, taxes, interest on land, picking and packing, depreciation on tools and machinery, and possibly some few other items, which hav« escaped my eagle eye — all of which are necessary items in the expense account of a well-managed orchard in that section.

It wai formerly said that the Northwest could beat the world on its wide range of varieties of apples which could be grown commercially at a profit. Like other uninformed foik I believed it. I don't any longer, since I have been talking with the men who know. I attended the National Apple Show at Spokane last November. In - cidentally it was a show much inferior to the first one four years ago, but there were many reasons' for this which it is unnecessary to recite here. About six carloads of last year's apples were brought from cold storage to fill up the show. The fact that there were six carloads of apples in cold storage in Spokane does not signify so much, possibly; but it does look a trifle odd that they should be there after this year's crop waa on the market. My visit to the Apple Show was purely to gather In - formation; hence I kept my eyes and ears open for the little confidences spoken in an undertone, which give one an idea of how things are really going at a big show. You understand this, you old exhibitors. We always put up a good front to the uninformed who come to see our show, but in strict confidence and quite between ourselves we unburden our mutual griefs for the somewhat uncertain solaces which comes from exchange of troubles. Knowing this from personal experience, I found out a lot of things at Spokane. I am not going to tell you all of them, but here are a You have heard a lot about the commercial qualities of the Winter Banana, the Delicious, the Jonathan, the Northern Spy, etc., among the famous apples of the Northwest. Let us get down to brass tacks on this proposition of varieties. At the first National Apple Show, I raw something over three hundred plates of Northern Spy apples to my untutored eye there were as many varieties of apples as there were plates. I asked the Judges to show me a standard plate so I could identify a Spy for myself, but got little satis - faction. This year I heard several people asking the experts about the Winter Banana. The invariable reply was that "they are good to look at, but not much good for anything else." I heard one of the oldtimers answer an inquirer who wanted to know something about the "Delicious" with the reply, that "It's the best advertised fake that ever grew on a. tree." And there you are. eiis process of elimination brings us down to where we must soon er the merits of our old friend the Jonathan, than which in my ent no better apple ever grew. What about the Jonathan in the •Travel stories in the Nebraska Farmer, 1911, by Frank G. Odell. </seg>

It Is the principal factor !■ determining their market, for they do get color and uniformity and flavor, too, in their Jonathans. And when you buy them as I did, at a Spokane grocery when I started for home, at the rate of $3. to per bushel .you begin to wonder what kind of a blessed apple country this is anyhow. Somehow one feels that they are paying rather liberally for color. I wandered around the Apple Show one evening in search of some scandalous things that 1 could tell you folks about the imperfections of the over-boomed Northwest, and all at once I stumbled on a juicy one: A sizable crowd was gathered about my old' friend. Prof. C. L. Smith of Kiesling, Washington, one of God's noblemen, a prince among horti - culturists and an honest man. They were interrogating him about the orchard business in general, for Smith is always the center of a crowd of interested people. Some one asked what were the best commercial varie - ties to plant. "Well," says Smith, "if you want to make money, plant Wagner, Rome Beauty, Stayman, Winesap. and Yellow Newton Pippins. If you want to spend your money for looks, get some Winter Banana, some Delicious and Jonathans." "What is the matter with the Jonathans?" "Why," says Smith, "nobody ever saw a Jonathan tree bear over ten boxes of apples in the state of Washington, and everybody who know* anything about them and is honest enough to tell the truth will tell you that after they get to the age of ten or twelve years they deteriorate *o fast both in quality and quantity that they are no longer profitable. If you want to plant them for fillers, they might possibly pay up to the twelfth year, but you may expect to have to cut them out afterward." And I had learned something; remember it; it will fit in a little later, before this paper is finished. AS TO THE FUTURE PROFITS IN THE NORTHWEST. Elt is safe to assert that the orchard is ts of the Northwest are not in business for their health primarily. They expect and should receive e returns, for they assume large expense. I have not found any or - chard land recommended as first-class for less than five hundred dollar* an acre when planted to two-year-old trees. It is more likely to run to one, two, or three thousand, if well located and with good water privi - lege. At the great Lewiston orchards, where 20,000 acres are under Irri - gation, 5,500 acres planted, and a thousand acres a year being planted, the cheapest land is $525 per acre. This is the largest individual orchard under irrigation so far as my knowledge extends. It is expected that when this reaches its minimum bearing capacity on the basis of the present planting, about four years hence, that ten thousand carloads of apples will be shipped annually from Lewiston. And that's some apples. The Horticultural Department of the Washington State Agricultural College made a thorough investigation of orchard capitalization and coat </seg>
            <seg id="p116">116 of the state of Washington they have an overhead charge of 51 cents per box for every apple that grows for the first eight years before they ciu. bring an apple to market. It takes a pretty good crop to stand a main - tenance charge of that sort. On the basis of the present census of trees now growing in the moun - tain states, a minimum production in the irrigated regions will add to the present crop not less than one hundred million boxes of apples an - nually within the next five years; and they are still planting. Moreover, other sections are planting, rejuvenating the old orchards, studying the most scientific methods, and coming into direct and active competition with our western brethren. There will no doubt be something, doing in the apple market presently. About what will be doing presently, it is something like this: The only way the western grower can keep alive is to produce strictly fancy fruit and sell it at a strictly fancy price, for he has all the time that 51 cents overhead charge on every box of apples. And you need not imagine that every apple they raise is perfect by any means; of course they don't put them in the pictures or the literature, but I find neverthe - less they have their cider mills and vinegar factories and canning works with plenty of apples to keep Uiem busy when they have a crop. This situation in which the western grower is finding himself will soon force the necessity of one of the greatest advertising propagandas the business world has ever seen — to popularize the use of the apple. It will be in the interest of the western apple and will be paid for by their money. It ought to do something to boost the market for the grow - ers of the Missouri valley region who have all the advantages of climate, reasonably priced land, nearness to market, and a speaking acquaintance with the good God who makes it rain here, once in a while anyhow. That is what it is worth, and it is worth a whole lot. One more Incident and this rambling paper will be done: I sat at table at the Spokane hotel with a group of gentlemen among whom Vas one who for seven years was at the head of the Horticultural Department of the Agricultural College of the state of Washington. One of the company asked the prolessor what proportion of the orchards of the irrigated section are likely to prove profitable. He replied that, "Not less than 50 per cent of the orchards now planted will be non-producers and fall to be commercially profitable, necessitating their replacement by different or better trees or the conversion of the land they now occupy to other uses." I said, "Professor, that is a remarkable statement." "But, sir," he replied, "I have examined almost every orchard of commercial propor - tions in this state, and I believe I am far within the truth in making that statement." He may be mistaken. I hope so, for the sake of the innocent people who have spent their millions in outrageously exaggerated land values </seg>
            <seg id="p117">FARMING WITH DYNAMITE. 117 under the spell of the boomer: but I fear that he is right and that a sad awakening is coming to the Northwest when its dream has passed. If these two men are right. — and they are two whose names are synonyms for authority in horticulture in the Northwest, — if they are right, and 50 per cent of the orchards now planted are to be commercial failures, and the Jonathans presently grubbed out of the 50 per cent that remains, there will be a lot of orchard land for sale presently at con - siderably reduced prices. I think we can afford to wait. I am profoundly convinced that the opportunities for commercial orcharding are greater in eastern Nebraska today than in the most prom - ising regions of the irrigated Northwest. Every trip Into that section and; every investigation on the ground confirms this view. This brings to me a feeling of deep and abiding content; a feeling of confidence in Nebraska as a commonwealth which will grow greater as the years pass, whose people are dwelling under the shadow of a great destiny in the potential empire of peace and plenty. P; Chairman: The next paper will be by Mr. Bdward Lewis, of wnt Powder Company of St. Louis, Missouri. His subject will be ig with dynamite." I understand that Mr. Lewis has no paper, will give you an address on the subject that has been assigned to FARMING WITH DYNAMITE. Edward Lewie, St. Louie, Missouri. Elies and Gentlemen — The name of Diipont suggests something scary, and the name of dynamite is also scary, but we do not en - to teach anybody to use it in the manner that the McNamaras so I hope that you will bear with me while I endeavor to tell you e are trying to do along this line. We are trying to teach the people to farm with dynamite; we are trying to teach the farmers, through their associations and by demon - strations, that dynamite can be used to help him improve his crops, and a* some people have said to make two blades of grass grow where one has grown before. Now we do not say that that can be done everywhere, or in every case, or every day, but what we do say is that farms can be improved and made better, and I think that I can show that this contention Is at least reasonable by what I have to say. Take for instance in the indus - try of tree planting, the dynamite used in that is composed mostly of nitrate of ammonia. Now if a person has not used this before he does not know much about it. and about iU effects, and it will probably make him sick the first time, or for the first two or three times he uses it. In using it in tree planting it is exploded underground, and when that hap - pens it of course distributes its properties through the subsoil, and be - cause of the properties it contains it is very beneficial. Bas very sorry I did not have a moving picture machine here so I low the different illustrations, and different things about which I </seg>
            <seg id="p118">118 wish to address you, but we could not have it because we had no elec - tricity. But altho I am not an artist, and as a matter of fact never drew a picture In my life. I will endeavor to show a few things on the board, so that you ma}' the better understand the things about which I am talk- Now in blowing out stumps, which Is one of the most important branches of farming with dynamite, we always try to get the dynamite where it will do the most good, and have the most effect. Now for ex - ample, we will suppose this is a stump here (indicating a figure drawn on the blackboard) and here is a tap root. The tap poot is the main root of the tree, just as the trunk of the tree is the main part above the sur - face, altho some trees do not have a very pronounced tap root. Now we will suppose this is the tap here, and a single charge of dynamite placed here at this tap root would not raise it so well, so as a remedy for thai we would suggest that electricity should be used. The next thing we will do is to drive a hole down here (indicating) n one side of it, and then go over here (indicating) and drive another lole down here, and get down to that tap root. Now to the rear we will ut in another one, and at the bottom of each one of these holes here e will take a small piece of dynamite, about an inch and a quarter thick. ou ran get it in any diameter, for thpt matter, from three-fourths of an nch on up. but we would recommend the inch and a quarter, and it eighs a half a pound to the stick. We will take about this much (in - cating) of the rap fuse, and put it In the end. No tamping at all, and at will make a pocket down there at the bottom of each stump. I have been asked the cost of clearing an acre of land, and I will ■ay that that is an unfair question in a great many ways. For example, we do not know whether or not the t-lumps are green, or dead, or have a tap root, or what. Now you take a twenty-foor inch stump, you take a dead one, and it should be pulled out with about four or five sticks of dynamite, because it has the extra radius that the twelve-inch stump did not have. Now you take the green stump, their roots are just ex - actly like a piece of steel, andd you would have a terrible hard time with any other way of removing them, and as a matter of fact it takes more dynamite to remove them than the roots of a dead stump. But we do know this, that we can prove conclusively that the stumps can be re - moved much cheaper with dynamite than they could be in any other way, or with a stump puller. I know of one red wood stump in Cali - fornia that took four hundred and fifty pounds of dynamite, but that is an exception. But then, too, that was not dynamite, it was black pow - der and simpler to shoot. We pour that in the bottom of the hole and we use one stick of dynamite as a primer. Now you see the black powder, being slower acting than the dynamite, it lifts the stump right up out of the ground, and the dynamite, being so much faster, some - times tears as well as lifts it out, -and hence you do not get as good or even the desired results. It might bring only one-half of the stump out in torn* cases, yon muit know how to choose between them. Therefore you get much better results than where they are both used together. </seg>
            <seg id="p119">119 There are two different ways of breaking boulders. One war is what is known as mud capping, and is done in this way: Here is a boulder that we want to break. Now if there should hap - pen to be a little depression in the boulder, take a few sticks of dyna - mite and cover it with mud, first putting your fuse down close to the dynamite, or right in with it, leaving about two feet stick out,, or more if you want to, and then put the mud all around it and on top of it The fuse is thus protruding, and the next thing to do is to light the fuse and run. You wonder how that can blow the rock to pieces, and why it would not Just blow the mud off and do nothing further. Well, here is the reason: That mud holds the shock to the rock. The mud is of course .full of water, and water is one of the best conductors we have. The other way to break boulders is when this boulder is on the ground, and when you want to lift it up, as well as breaking it. Put it on or under the boulder just like you would under a stump, as I ax - plained before. That is what we call s-nako-holing, and you put it in that way and Just lift or force it out. In planting trees, we have another use for dynamite. This thing is getting to be a great industry down in the Ozark country of Missouri. You folks do not have hard pan like they do there. I said something about hard pan in Topeka last week, and they took exception to it I said that was all right, "let's call it concrete then." You can imagine the advantage in planting trees with dynamite in that kind of a soil over the method of digging holes for them, for so many reasons which I will not try to explain. Here is a tree to be planted. Now we will say that tree wants to be planted about eighteen inches below the surface of the ground. We will place half a stick of 25 per cent Red Cross dynamite in that hole, and tamp the stick. We have the fuse sticking out here, and we have it tamped just as tight as we can. Well, touch it off and let it go. That explosion comes out, and goes down as well, and in going down, it loosens up the soil for the roots for a radius of from eight to sixteen feet in diameter. And if it is just ordinary dirt, it will go from six to eight inches down. All that is necessary from that time on Is to take three or four spadefuls of dirt out, and you have the ground ready for the tree. This loosening up of the ground on either side will give the roots a chance to grow immediately. You can see the great advantage of that. For if it is dug with a spade, of course the sides are packed and it does not give the roots a chance to grow, that the loose dirt brought about by the dynamite explosion does. Subsoil blasting, or hard pan blasting, as we sometimes call it, la the next important thing I will take up. We call this top soil, the soil which has been used up, and has not very much more plant life left in it, we call that, the top soil. Well, in the subsoil blasting you get at the ■oil that the plow can not reach, you get at the hard pan. I hart heard of instances where plows can be gotten under the ground twenty-two </seg>
            <seg id="p120">120 NEBRASKA BTATK HORTM I I.T1K AI. BO. Inches deep, below the grass, and it will give the desired depth, but with dynamite you can do better. Now puncture a hole down, this way. Say it is four feet, and then take half a stick of Red Cross dynamite and tamp it in. The harder you tamp it in, the better, for where the explosion conies it will break this subsoil right where you want the force of the dynamite to work. f hard pan once is allowed to have water to gather in it, or you can force the moisture into it, you can rest assured it will disintegrate, and you will not be bothered with it any more, but you can not say that with a clay subsoil, it will not last that way, and it will have to be re - ilasted every six or seven years. With the deep plowing, this top soil las been worked to death, but with dynamite you can lift this dirt up, and scatter it for four or five feet on top of the hole. So in doing this you get the richer and better soil on top of the worn out soil, and mixed n with it, and thereby you enrich it. Now take it in sections of fifteen eet, and you go right down the side of the field. If you have an ex - ilosion at all these places I have indicated, you are bound to get the dirt stirred up so the water can get into the hard pan, and cause it to isintegrate. In subsoiling lands, we generally figure (.here are 194 holes to the acre, but to be safe, we say there are IM. We would use one-fourth of a stick to each hole, or in other words that would be 50 pounds to the acre. In Nebraska it is 16 cents a pound, and that would be $8.00 to the acre. At 2^4 feet deep it would tost $5 for fuse, and caps at a cent apiece, would be $2. That would make a total of $15 an acre. Now $15 an acre seems to be pretty large, but when you very nearly double your crop the first year, it may pay for what you do. There is nothing we can do for the betterment of our land but what will cost us something. There is no betterment we can put into or upon the land that will bo as permanent and far reaching as this subsoiling with dynamite. A Thayer, Missouri, farmer placed his dynamite about thirty feet apart, and he planted his corn in the land that he had dynamited, and It doubled his crop the first year. He had twice as large a crop where he used dynamite, as where he did not use it, or on the same land the year before. A Member: Have you any figures on the labor or the cost of putting in the dynamite? A. One of our professional dynamiters who was here, if I am not mistaken, two weeks ago, gave a demonstration on that. We gave a emonstratton in Centralia, Illinois, and we subsoiled nearly two acres n a day. Of course, if any one wants to do a great deal of subsoiling. t would be better to do more than an acre at a time, and the chances re that the dealer you buy your supplies from will be pretty good to you on the price. He will be pretty good to you on the price of your fuse. Some of them really charge one cent when they should not. kThis is about all there is to the main discussion or talk that I In - id to give to you, but I would be glad to answer any questions that y of you may have to ask. </seg>
            <seg id="p121">121 A Member: I have a question I would like to ask because I have seen this demonstration recently in hard pan. And I also saw it in gumbo that was saturated with water. Practically it did not work out, in my mind, as theoretically it should. Instead of breaking this hard pan and gumbo up, it parked it so hard you could not cut it, and could not do anything with it. After I saw this the thought occurred to me that you ought to have yor hard pan subsoil dry instead of wet." A. Yes, sir; it is best. But as regards gumbo, it is harder than hard pan and we do not like to fool with that. We do not make any claim on the gumbo, but if wo are pinned down to it, the best we will say Is that we will do the best we can. But the facts of the matter are that we have shot gumbo In Nebraska, right here in your own state, and have been very successful in opening it up. And we have reclaimed that ground in some instances. Q. What percentage of dynamite do you use? Ei-enty-flve per cent for subsoiling, and the same for tree plant - 40 per cent in blasting. We have found those amounts to be Q. What have you to say as to the value of blasting and the use of dynamite in an old orchard, and in the soil under old trees? A. I am very glad that you called my attention to that point. That is a very important thing. We call it the rejuvenating of old orchards. It is all right. I saw it worked, and it was very successful. My idea is to go down about four feet into the ground and shoot. The best thing I have found for this is to use a stick of 25 per cent dynamite. Q. What does this 40 per cent dynamite usually retail for? A. About 17 cents. A cent higher than the 25. Q. And your 60 per cent? Et is 18 cents. We do not recommend the use of the 60, except ing ditches. The price or it here is a little higher than that, it 20 or 21 cents. Q. Your 40 per cent dynamite, you say is 16 cents? A. 8ixteen or 17 cents, something like that. We do not try to re - strict it. If we should tell every dealer the price he should sell it at, Uncle Sam would break up the DuPont Powder Company in about fifteen minutes. We suggest to them what they should charge, but that is as far as we go in the matter. Q. In breaking up the old orchards, would it not be better to use the slow explosives? A. Twenty-five is slow enough, and 40 is too quick. They tell me that the nitrate of ammonia which forms the nitrogen in the ground, will give color to the fruit, but how true 1 that Is I do not know, and I would not want to go on record as saying it was true. Q. About how much nitrogen would there be? A. I should not imagine there would be very much. If you want to plaat the tree about IS inches, put the charge down 18 inches, aad It will break the ground 24 inchea. It would be better, in fact It is better. </seg>

The Chairman: On behalf of the Horticultural Society I want to thank Mr. Lewis for the splendid talk he has given us and hope that we may sometime in the future have the pleasure of learning more about this most interesting and profitable subject. The next speaker on the program for this afternoon, will be Hon. E. M. Pollard, of Nehawka, who will address us on the subject of "Converting cull fruit into older and Tteagmr." CONVERTING CULL FRUIT INTO CIDER AND VINEGAR. Hon. E. M. Pollard, Nehawka. Ladies and Gentlemen — Of course in presenting this question, it de - peads entirely upon your view-point, the range that the discussion should take. If you have a small orchard and are in a community where there are a few, or perhaps no apples grown besides those you produce, then it hardly pays to construct a cider mill and put in the machinery necessary to take care of it. On the other hand, if you are living in a community where there are a great many apples grown, it might pay and pay well to put In the cider mill and go into the business of manufacturing cider and vinegar. As to the cost of putting in the plant, I have only taken into account a plant that would produce considerable cider, perhaps with a capacity of from live hundred to one thousand gallons a day. I would not, and I do not believe I would advise any one to put in a mill that did not have a hydraulic press. There are a great many different kinds of presses on the market There are a good many presses manufactured that take all the Juice out of the apple, and of course you want to get all the juice and not leave a part of it in the pumice. A hydraulic press with a capac - ity of from twenty-five to fifty barrels of cider, operated by hand power, will cost about two hundred dollars. A hydraulic press with a capacity of from fifty to fifteen hundred barrels per day will cost around four hundred dollars, running of course by power. And of course you can in - crease that as much as you want to, and the greater it will cost propor - tionately. Then comes the cost of power. In most communities there are traction engines used for threshing purposes that can be used or hired to run your mill for a nominal cost, or you can put in a stationary engine at a cost of anywhere from a thousand up to two thousand dol - lars, according to the capacity of the plant you want to operate. Now the cost of making the cider. We have a very large plant there, and make cider on a large scale. I have figured a great many times the cost of manufacturing the cider per gallon, taking a week's run. Some - time* a machine will run satisfactorily all day, and other days a small imMwit will delay you an hour or two, — those things always occur In all marhln— ■ I have figured all those things la arriving at any kind of </seg>
            <seg id="p123">123 a conclusion. And taking it on an average it costs to manufacture cider about Vt a cent a gallon, that is the actual cost. And it is taking into account the interest on your investment and the cost of fuel and labor on your machine. I will say that is on a basin of from 500 to 5,000 gal - lons a day. I have never made a test as to any particular variety, for at home we dump all the apples into a pen, promiscuously, without any re - gard to separating the varieties, and we never have grown any variety and made a test of it. But, taking them as they come, the average bushel of apples will produce about 3V&amp; gallons of cider, or about 7 gallons to the hundred weight. Now you see it will net you about 20 cents a bushel for your apples, and of course those of us that are in the apple business know we have a great many apples of that kind, and it is simply a saving of a waste, which is always commendable in any enterprise. The conversion of cider into vinegar is another question, and in my opinion it is much more preferable an undertaking of the manufacture of cider to put it on the market as such. Especially I think it is true if you are going to operate on a small scale, and not go into the business too extensively. In what is known as the quick process of the manufacture of vinegar you can take the sweet juice today, and in thirty days or less convert it Into cider or vinegar. Now that does not seem true, but it is. Under what is known as the quick process, all that is done is the separation of the cider into its smallest parts, or into drops, so that every drop of the cider comes in contact with the air at once. Under the old process we made our cider in the fall, and we put it in a whisky barrel and rolled the barrel out under the apple tree at home, and put a bung into it, and so forth, and let the barrel lie there for two or three years' time, and it came out all right. It went through the same process that we put it through in the quick process. In order to convert cider into vinegar it has to have access to the air. The alcohol in the cider consumes the oxygen from the air, and converts it into acetic acid, and that is what gives the strength to the vinegar. Under what is known as the quick process that cider is broken up, and each drop comes in contact with the air at once, and that is why it is known as the quick process, and that is why we can make good vine - gar in a short time. The generator we use is a tank 3Vi feet in diameter, and about 7 feet high. It has two bottoms, the lower bottom being tight, and the other bottom, ten inches above, is perforated with a great many little holes. We simply dump into this second bottom shavings which are made for this second business and which help to ripen the cider. Three days from the time we start with the sour cider we have vinegar. The shrinkage during the converting process of cider varies accord - ing to the method of handling. The variation will run all the way from 10 to 30 per cent Of course 30 per cent is a heavy shrinkage. After the cider has passed through its fermentation stage and has become entirely quiet, there should be a top put over the tank and made air-tight to pre- </seg>

Now as to the profits. In making cider that is an important thing. We have been in the business for almost twenty-five years and we have gone thru all the ups and downs of the cider business, and it is only within the last ten years we have made a success of it, that is, the hand - ling of the cider as a finished product. There is a good market for cider. I presume in Nebraska there is consumed every year from twelve to eigh - teen tars of sweet cider, which is drunk as a beverage. Cider is one of ti&gt;e hardest commodities in the world to control. When fermentation begins in a barrel of cider it is next to impossible to stop it, unless it is pasteurized. That will check ft. There is no grocery - man that has been in the business any length of time at all who has not tried taking cider from farmers or fruit men without experience, on ac - count of friendship or some other reason that has permitted him to do so, and in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred it has gone back on him. For that reason it is difficult to sell or introduce it. I think it was about ten years ago we found oui how to prevent fermentation, or rather how to preserve the cider. It has then taken us ten years to build up a business. Even now in piaces we have trouble in selling our goods. The dealers all know the cider that is made in New York, or know the Duffy brand, and know that won't spoil, but they don't all know our cider. Eit with vinegar it is different. You convert cider into vinegar and ve a staple product. Everybody knows what it is, and it commands good price. So my advice to the fruit growers would be this: Put nail plant, because it is desirable to save the waste. DISCUSSION. P Member: You spoke about the vinegar always being salable. Now country, it is good pure cider I know about, and our merchants buy it at four cents a gallon. Mr. Pollard: Is it made the old way? Member: Yes, sir. Mr. Pollard: The trouble is because every grocerytnan, that ever bad a barrel of that vinegar knows he has about three or four gallons of slush in the bottom. Member: They refuse to touch it if it is drawn off. Mr. Pollard: Has the vinegar been tested, so that it comes up to the requirements of the law? Member: They say it does not make any difference, that it is illegal E. Pollard: That is not true. I would like to buy it at that price is nothing in the law that prevents the groceryman from buying - from a farmer, or prevents a farmer from selling his vinegar to a groceryman, providing of course the vinegar comes up to the test of the pure food law. Member: Must you have it tested beforehand? Mr. Pollard: It is best to do that because if you do not do it you arc liable to be prosecuted. </seg>
            <seg id="p125">125 Member i I think this m i&amp;h t be &amp; cood res son why this co do it ion exists, that no matter how good it Is, or how it tests, they seem to refuse it. It might be because when they haul it in to the groceryman, it is all stirred up, and it is not the same as it was when he started from home with it Mr. Pollard: That is the point exactly.

MOKNIXCJ SESSION THURSDAY, JANUARY 18, 1912. Pi President: The first paper on the program will be a paper en- Ureetings from C. S. Harrison." .Mr. Harrison is spending the in southern California for his health. To the Members of the Horticultural Society: Dear Fellow Laborers — I find myself in this land of dreams and of eternal summer. It is hard to adjust myself to it. I visited a nursery ' rday. They do not have packing sheds and storage cellars. Every day in the year is salesday except Sundays. One peculiar thing here is the rise of the land. I think they must fertilize with years. Ten acres soon becomes forty, then eighty and then one hundred and sixty. Men will look you squarely in the eye and say that they can get more off 10 acres than we can from 160. You never can catch a Californian in a lie. I suppose that the lie goes so fast they can't get it, to say nothing about getting into it. Land rises so fast that you get afraid of it. Now Harry got ten acres of lemon orchard and went home and turned around a few times and then went back. They told him his land had doubled in value. We went out to see it. It was a fine piece and the trees looked well. I was a little afraid to get on it for fear that it would rise with me, so I stayed in the road. Harry went onto it, and, in short, ran all over it. I was afraid that it would rise with him on it, and I didn't know what would become of the boy, but we got back all safe and I could not see as the land was much higher than when we or he first went on it. fWe saw thousands of acres of English walnuts. They were fine or - (Is, and yet they are cutting them down by the thousand. "What is trouble?" I asked, "they look well and healthy and bear good crops." answer was, "We can't stand the measly meager returns. We can only get $100 per acre." How they were abused! We saw great orchards of oranges, and some groves have immense packing houses and ehip by the train load. This whole business keeps you in a whirl and you must get adjusted to it.

Ee President: The next paper on the program will be by F. C. of the Fruit Judging Team of the School of Agriculture, on 'The il Horticultural Congress." THE NATIONAL HORTICULTURAL CONGRESS. F. C. Miles, Fruit Judging Team, College of Agriculture. The Fourth National Horticultural Congress was held at Saint Jo - seph, Missouri, November 23 to December 2, 1911. While the attendance was not exceedingly large, yet undoubtedly the meeting will have a wide - spread influence. It seems that comparatively few people, who have never attended one of these large fruit shows, can realize the importance t&gt;f being pres - ent We all understood that, in order to succeed in any line of work, it was necessary to have an ideal, and horticultural work proves no excep - tion. The primary object of the congress is to establish that ideal for the fruit grower. The grower has the opportunity to see almost perfect fruit and he ran fix standards of the varieties in which he is interested. Thus he has something better to strive for. He comes in contact with other growers, and if he is an exhibitor he will see the points of superior - ity in the fruit which wins the prizes, and then by taking advantage of the several features &lt;&gt;! the congress he will be better fitted to compete in th» following year. Ei addition to Feeing an excellent display of fruit one may attend the ims which are given. At the meeting this winter such subjects as ying to control apple diseases," "Control of fruit insects," "Market - ing the apple crop." "Orchard heating," and various other phases of or - chard management were presented by prominent authorities in these Also there was each day a demonstration in the packing of fruit. Numerous forms of spraying machinery and other appliances used by the fniit grower were on exhibition, and a critical study could be made of the various types. Another feature of the enow was the Students Fruit Judging Con - test The contest was open to teams composed of undergraduate stu - dents from any agricultural college in the United States. A trophy in the form of a cup. donated by the Twentieth Century Farmer of Omaha was awarded to the winning team. In order to become the permanent property of any college the cup must be won two consecutive years. Ne- </seg>
            <seg id="p127">127 braska won the cup in 1909, Iowa won it in 1910, and Nebraska regained it in 1911. Next year another trophy will be awarded to the team moat proficient in Judging from a box or barrel pack. This will be an induce - ment to the agricultural colleges to offer courses in judging apples in the box and barrel pack. As to the exhibits at the congress, the Western Fruit Grower states that the quality of fruit was better than in previous years. North Caro - lina had a fine display on which they won first prize, while Colorado won second prize on their display. DISCUSSION. The Chairman: Are there any remarks? Member: Gentlemen, I think this is a very creditable report for the boys to bring back. I am glad to see them interested in the work. I The Chairman: The next paper on this morning's program is by W. J. Courtright, of Fremont. Mr. Courtright is not here, but he has his paper and the secretary will read it to you. RAISING FLOWERS ON A CITY LOT. W. J. Courtright, Fremont. Before presenting ray paper, it may be well to introduce myself in order that you may the better judge what credence to give to what I pre - sent to you. My age, 49; residence, Fremont, Nebraska; regular occu - pation, attorney-at-law ; fad, garden flowers; length of experience in rais - ing them, five years. In this short time I have progressed from the pro - moter of a flower garden to toe owner of a garden of flowers. The chief attribute of a flower garden is anticipation. A garden of flower* means anticipation in winter, and realization in spring, summer, and autumn. I understand it is because, in so short a time. I have made good, that I am asked to prepare this paper, and to tell you what I raise and how and Phave a plan of my own, chosen because of conditions. Being cen - • located in the city, with the bare ground worth at the rate of sev - thousand dollars an acre, and only a small amount of it, I have de - •oted the rear third, every foot of it, to flowers. Everything is in a mass. In winter I draw my ground plans all to a scale. In many cases I raise two crops in a year on the same ground. For instance, tulips and hya - cinths, which bloom early and then die to the ground, may be followed by aster, salvia, snapdragon, verbena or petunia, and the annual poppy may be followed by petunia or verbena. In the choice of flowers I have certain standards. I want &lt;he largest amount of bloom per day per square foot. Notice this language. I say the largest amount of bloom per day per square foot Hence I discard all biennials, because a plant that grows one year blooms the next, then dies, is 50 per cent loss to me. The flower of only a short blooming period I discard unless I can bloom </seg>
            <seg id="p128">NKBKVKA STATK HORTMTI/H li.U. SuClKTY 128 another the same year on the same spare. If a flower is not good for rutting, then I want il to have a long blooming season in the garden. If it U good for cutting, then the longer it will keep fresh in the vase the better. Of course I consider the question of beauty and the element of fragrance are important where they can be had. I very soon learned to choose single flowers instead of doubles. If I were raising blossoms to sell by the pound I would choose doubles. For garden or vase display the singles are far superior. Among perennials I choose only the hardy kinds, for continual winter killing is annoying. The selection must be such that there will be both a garden display and a cut flower supply for vases for every week from early spring until late frost. And I want to do the bosBing, hence want no flower pests to take charge of the garden. I also consider the question of easy to raise and reasonable certainty of results, as well as economy of time and money. These are my general principles. Necessarily there are exceptions. I endure weakness in some point because of great value in others, never expecting perfection in all points. In my early inexperience I was much troubled to know the proper distance apart for planting, and thought how easy it would be for the seed catalogs to state proper distances. In this article the figures after each flower represent the distance apart in inches that I recommend. That is, aster 12x12 means the plants should stand one foot apart each way in the garden. I raise most of my own plants because I enjoy it. Others may prefer to buy. Every annual flower I now raise may be started in the open ground to advantage, except cosmos, pansy, salvia, and tuberoses, al - though I start some petunias inside for early plants. I use window boxes three and one-half by ten inches, and three inches deep, for early seed - ing, putting four boxes to a window. I paint the boxes so they will not be unsightly. I bore two small holes in the bottom, cover these with a bit of broken pot, sprinkle in a little sand, fill with sifted soil, put on the seed, cover very lightly, press down very firmly, then »et the box in water until the soil is saturated by capillary attraction from below. Suc - cessive waterings I do in the same way. By this plan a sprouting seed or small plantlet is never moved. The drainage being good, I have never yet lost a plant by "damping off." When these house started plants are large enough, 1 transfer to three-inch pots, and plunge these to the rim close together in the garden, surround by boards and cover with glass luh on nights and cold days until frost is. over. By this time they are fine large plants and easily transferred to the open garden without dis - turbing a single fine root. I must not fail to mention the condition of my ground. Every foot of it has been trenched, that is, spaded two spades deep, keeping the top soil on top. The benefit of this is noticable every year, and was espe - cially so during the dry season of last year. I have discarded many flowers as undesirable for my purpose, and I shall first list them, giving the reasons why I no longer have them. Some </seg>
            <seg id="p129">KAIS1NU 1'I.OWKItS ON A CITY LOT. 129 to other climates. Violets I found more of a pest than a flower. Com - panula, digitalis, and Sweet William are biennials, that is, you grow the plants one year, they bloom the second and then die. Nasturtiums are fine for some, easily grown, but common, and the space is worth more in something else. Carnations need a greenhouse, supports, and lots of care. Tritoma will not stand our cold winters. Bachelor buttons are fine, but other kinds are finer. Opinions differ widely on this, however. Forget-me-not is too tender for our winters. Bellis blooms are fine for a day or two, then fade, then shortly become very unsightly. Portulaca blooms for only half a day, and is such an inveterate self-seeder as to be a pest for years to come. I have been trying for three years to get rid of it, and yet a bed of it in bloom is a beauty. Salpiglossis is certainly a novelty, easily raised, but is not fragrant nor much good for cut flowers is not a profligate bloomer, and the duration is only a month or so. Ten weeks stocks are fine plants, but no flowers to speak of, and I don't know why, as I started them early, and the few blooms I did get came three months before frost. Boltonia, advertised so highly, has a short bloom ing period in fact, although there are scattering blossoms for two months Chrysanthemums are too slow for our short seasons. Scabiosa blooms are too small and few to count enough. Ageratum is a pest. I bougnt i for a six-inch high edging plant. It was soon three times this high, and each plant is sufficient to self-seed four hundred thousand million (esti mated, not counted) other plants. Some of these later grew and bloomed the same season as their parent plants. Begonia is too tender for the garden, although some varieties do reasonably well. Crocus did not last Not one out of hundreds came up the third year, and only a very few the second year. Coreopsis is apparently too tender without winter protec tion. Centaurea needs about ten times more blooms to make it worth while. Shasta daisies apparently won't stand either the hot sun of sum nier or the cold of winter, or at least mine did not. Hibiscus needs a farm instead of a city lot. It is tall and straggly. Verbena is fine and to be recommended, but petunia answers every purpose for me and think is superior in several respects. The season is a little longer a each end, and the persistence of bloom greater. However, a bed of blue and purple verbenas that I had attracted as much attention as anything I had and these colors are hard to supply in other flowers suited for con tinuous garden display. I will now list and describe the flowers I am continuing to raise: KAchillea 36x36, has a small white double flower, and blooms from &gt; 20 until frost. The roots may be divided every year. It Is very y. When the flowers fade, cut the top all off and new flowers will come. Pine for garden display, cemeteries and cut flowers. Aster, annual, 12 x 12, I raise from seed planted in open garden in Hay. Thus started, it will bloom from August until frost comes. Extra choice for vases. It is a mistake to start the seed too early in the house, as much better flowers are produced in the cool weather of the late fall. Bleeding Heart, 36x36, blooms in April and has scattering blooms 5 </seg>
            <seg id="p130">130 NEBRASKA STATE UOBTICULTl'UAL SOCIETY all summer. I have had It frozen to the ground after being in bloom, and in a few weeks from that time it was again loaded with blossoms. Divide roots every three years. Columbine, 12 z 18, blooms in later April and lasts for fifty days. When gone the foliage is fine. Plant seed and plants will bloom the fol - lowing year and increase for a few yean. I have at least fifty different colors and they are all very beautiful. This is a very choice flower. Clematis Panlculata is a choice vine, white and fragrant flower bloom - ing late in autumn. It is the only clematis vine that I have obtained sat - isfactory results with, as the others die shortly. 1 Cosmo*, 30 x 30. is a choice autumn bloomer, fine for cut flowers. It important to get the dwarf early flowering varieties, as the giant flow - ered kind are too slow to get ahead of our early frosts. Start seed early in the house, and plant out in Hay. They need good supports, being very brittle. My dwarf varieties grow about four feet high and are greatly prixed, both for flower and foliage. For cosmos and dahlias I use a sup - port of my own designing. I get heavy woven wire field fencing about three feet high, and cut into thirty-foot lengths. Bend each length into four pear-shaped sections something Mke a double figure eight, with the centers drawn together and fastened, and the two ends of the thirty-foot length joined together. In each of the four sections I put a plant, and with cosmos four or eight plants may be placed outside and tied to the wire frame. These wire frames are stiff enough to hold up the plants, and can be given a new location each year, as they simply rest on the surface of the ground. Dahlias, 30x30, I grow from tubers only. Plant a tuber with a good long neck, four inches deep in May, and when up a few inches cut off all but four branches and then let it alone, except to provide good support, as it is very brittle and easily broken by the wind. Blooms from mid- July until frost, and is fine for cut flowers. One tuber in the spring will make several by fall. After hard frost, cut off the top, and carefully dig the whole bunch of tubers, leaving the dirt on, and store in a dry cellar with preferred temperature between forty and fifty-five degrees. They must not freeze. Leaving the dirt on all winter is a big help and keeps them from withering. In spring, remove the dirt and cut tubers apart with .care, remembering that none will grow without an eye, and that the rare in the neck only. Use the supports suggested for Cosmos, but only four plants for one clump. Delphinium, 18x30, will bloom some the first season if seeds are started in boxes in March but the second and following years the bloom will be much greater. Seed planted in summer as soon as ripe will make good plants for the following year. Old plants bloom in June, and by cutting down the stalk as soon as it is done flowering, new blossoms will come, and in this way I have prolonged the season until October. The roots may also be divided. The flowers are various shades of blue in color. Choice for both garden and as cut flowers. </seg>
            <seg id="p131">HA1SINU FLOWERS ON A CITY LOT. 131 raised by division of roots. My experience with it is too limited to say more than that. Eschscholtzia, or California poppy, 18 x 18, I have raised one year only. Ti.e seed must be planted in open ground very early, and where they are to remain, as this, like other poppies, is not transplanted with much success. Blooms freely from June until autumn. It is as beautiful a shade of yellow as I ever have seen. The flowers, both in garden and vase, will close up near evening, but come out again full in the morning. Gaillardia, 18x18, is the most prolific bloomer that I know of. Old plants will commence in early June and continue for four months, while plants raised from seed started early in boxes will bloom some the first season. Prevailing shades are maroon and yellow mixed. The flower stems are long, and in vases it will last ten days. The odor is not pleas - ant, but otherwise it is choice. It will survive our winters reasonably twith little or no covering other than it3 own leaves, although It is lost tender of any perennial plant I raise. Golden Glow, 36 x 36, blooms from mid-July until frost and is certainly king of yellow cut flowers and fine also for the garden. The roots should be divided at least every second year. The tall stems are better Tor sup - port. Gladiolus, 4 x 12, is one of my favorites. I plant the bulbs about seven inches deep. Deep planting furnishes a long below-ground stem so that the wind will not blow them over during a rain. I plant several hundred of these every year, at different seasons from April first to June fifteenth. The flowers come on long stems, and by cutting the stem when the blooms commence at the bottom, they will continue to bloom in the vase from bottom to top and thus last for ten days. If it had perfume it would be the perfect flower, for it is easy to raise, certain of result, fine for garden display, an enduring cut flower, and is superbly beautiful. One bulb planted in spring will generally produce two or more by autumn. In late October when leaves are considerably withered, dig the bulbs, cut off tops, dry in the open for a couple of weeks, then store in cellar same as onions, keeping from frost. Hollyhocks, 18 x 18, will self-seed most freely. They bloom second season from seed and for me have continued to bloom satisfactorily for several years, although some people call them a biennial only. They commence blooming in early July. Hyacinth, 7 x 7, is my favorite early spring flower, and I have a few hundred in alternate double rows of red, white, and blue. While they cost more than tulips they are preferable because each bloom lasts much longer and the bulb is more permanent. Iris, 18x18, is choice. I have thrown away all the faded out blues-, and now have beautiful deep blues, whites, purples, and yellows. They bloom in May. Divide the roots every two to four years. I have also the Japanese Iris, which blooms in July, and nothing can be finer. I treat it the same as the other. </seg>
            <seg id="p132">132 fine, but elegans, candidum and speciosum are my favorites. The elegans blooms in June, the candidum early, the others much later. All should be planted in the autumn, and it is important to plant the candidum in August or very early in September, as it makes a strong new growth in the autumn. Llly-of-Valley, 6x6, should be planted in the fall and left undisturbed for several years, as it does not bloom much the first year after planting. The sprays of small white flowers coming in early Hay are exceedingly fragrant and fine. Linum, or Flowering Flax, 12 z 12 is a beautiful blue flower resembling phlox in shape. The foliage is beautiful and stays green all winter. Will bloom a little the first season if seed is started very early. A year old plant may have a hundred blossoms in the morning, but by afternoon every one will have fallen and by next morning 1 another hundred will be in full bloom. This will last for several weeks. When blooming has ce—fd and seeds are coming, cut down a few inches from the ground and in a few weeks a new supply of flowers will be ready. Lobelia is a fine low growing edging plant suited specially for wet and shady places, and easily grown from seed. The erect varieties should be planted six inches apart. The flowers are deep blue. Pansy, 9 x 9, I start in boxes in January or February, later pot them and set them in the garden under glass cover and have them ready for open planting by May the tenth. I find by this plan they bloom well from the last of Hay until frost. Peony, 24 x 36, is another of my favorites. I have forty plants of six - teen named varieties. It is best to get the choice kinds only. For home flowers do not divide roots oftener than once in five years. I like my whites best, and dark reds next. Petunia, 12 x 12, is one of the best for all season garden display. Ex - perience has taught me better than to ever again try double or giant flowering kinds. The medium priced, medium sized single varieties are far superior for practical results. It self-seeds, so there is an abundance of volunteer plants each spring, though I start some in boxes for extra early flowers. A plant once started is as hardy as a weed. I have taken plants full grown and blooming, cut the tops nearly to the ground, trans - planted the roots in the heat of summer, and had a solid mass of blooms in less than a month. Hence they are good as a second crop following early flowers. Sweet Peas must be planted very early in spring, and quite deep. For a support I use a circle three feet in diameter made of very heavy woven wire field fencing. This is one of the very few flowers where I plant a mixture of colors. Perennial Pea*, 24 x 24, are not fragrant and will not bloom until the second or third year, but a few of them are worth while. Plant the seed where they are to remain. </seg>
            <seg id="p133">133 generally do every year, but there is no barm if dividing is only done each second year. I have ten named varieties and as soon as I can mul - tiply these into a sufficient number I will discard all the common un - named ones. Annual Poppy, 6x6, must be planted very early and may be planted in the fall. I sow the seed broadcast, and thin as desired. I prefer the Shirley mixed varieties. As cut flowers there can be nothing more beau - tiful. The blooms are so numerous that the short life of each does not count. Do not try to transplant. When the blooms have finished in mid - summer, pull up the plants, and All the ground with plants of petunia*. Oriental Poppy, 24 x 24, must be seen to be understood. The second year from seed my plants have raised six blooms each of seven or eight inches in diameter of the most brilliant name color I ever saw. Plants ■are long lived and increase in bloom, and once started need no attention. In mid-summer the tops all die like tulips, but in the autumn come up new and remain green all winter. They bloom in May. The plants are both the hardest and the easiest to raise and transplant. To start, I bought twenty-five plants and saved cnly five of them. This was better than most have done. I now have transplanted a hundred and not lost one. With a garden trowel I dig a deep straight hole, place the long tap root on the side of it, and plaster the dirt carefully around the root, then Ee hole and water good once. Transplant in early September. I the seed very early in the spring, keep moist and keep a lath screen he plants until September. Rose*, 12 x 12, I plant new every spring, using the tender every-bloom - ing varieties only, getting very small pot plants. By this plan I have roses in bloom every day from May until the last of October. Of course I also have the climbing crimson rambler. Eilvia is best eighteen inches apart in a single row. Mine is about feet high and from mid-July until frost it is a solid mass of. bril - scarlet, that for garden display has no superior. Start the seed and protect from frost. Snapdragon, 12x12, is very odd, of many colors, and fine for both garden display and cut flowers. The duration of bloom is good in both Puberose, 12 x 12, is the most fragrant flower I know of. Nothing is to wear. The bulbs need eighty or more degrees of temperature to them. I start in pots and place where very warm in the house, and give them a good start by planting-out time in May. In this way I get the earliest to bloom by the middle of August, and others continue until frost. Tulips, 6x6. I plant six inches deep, choosing the single named varie - ties only. I have discarded all doubles and mixed colors. A hundred or more in a bed is best. They should be dug and reset every one to three years. They bloom in April. Most of mine are quite fragrant and last </seg>
            <seg id="p134">134 Zinnias, 18 x 18, bloom from mid- June until frost. They are coum, but show well at a distance. One may as well try mixed seed. I saved seed last year from three of the finest colored plants and this year those three plants gave me eleven distinct colors. I now have more charity for the seedsman than I bad. tThig ends my list at present. Of the perennials I think most of col - tine, delphinium, goldenglow, hyacinth,* iris, linum, peony, oriental py, and phlox. Of the annuals my preferences are aster, cosmos, lla, gladiolus, pansy, petunia, ever-blooming roses, salvia, snapdragon, -ley poppy and tuberose. I list the ever-blooming rose as an annual luse I do not try to preserve them over winter. By buying small its in quantities in spring they are very cheap and soon produce bet - than old plants. tAH my flowers must be of choice varieties. I know better than to se scrubs. It doesn't pay from any standpoint. Common varieties y do to experiment with but as soon as one has learned how, and found lower worth retaining, he should get a start of the very finest variety It In flowers I see human nature, and it is a most Interesting study. Some have the most delicate and dainty beauty, which, as in human be - ings, is fleeting and easily dissipated. Some are glorious in their strength and majesty and remind us of the various leaders of humanity. Some are tender, suggesting him who gives great promise but falis by the way - side at the first serious opposition. Some are hardy, like the man who brooks no restraint, but with an iron will ever presses forward. Some are fleeting or transitory, suggesting the notional or unstable man who may never be depended upon. Some are enduring, regardless of weather, reminding me of him who is always on duty, no matter what obstructions may be encountered. Some respond only to favorable conditions, like the man who balks unless the environment is just to his liking. Some are of stately beauty suggesting enduring friendship. Some are sweetly fragrant, reminding of the warm, sympathetic heart which is always loved. Some have several of these good qualities. Every one of them possesses one or more qualities of merit. They are the creations of the Almighty in His dispensation of the beauties of nature — but not one of them is perfect. Not one in the list possesses all of the six elements of hardiness, long duration of bloom for the garden, a long stem, long keep - ing qualities necessary for a cut flower, great beauty and sweet frag - rance. As I study the traits of human nature in my flowers I have an ever-enlarging charity for the imperfections of man and the children of DISCUSSION.

He has become very enthusiastic about it, and now all that he will talk to you about is flowers, and it has been but a few years when he scarcely knew one flower from another. It is only another ex - ample about how entnusiastic people get when once they become interested in flowers, and it is almost always the case. A few years ago when you would meet Mr. Courtright on the street, all he would talk about was law, and now it is all flowers. It is Just an example of enthusiasm. People can not do better than to attract their attention to the cultivation of flowers, and it is surprising how enthusiastic they get, and it is something that should be encouraged as much as possible. I think it is a very good idem to spread this knowledge among the people who live in the cities and vil - lages especially. People should want something to do, and those who want something to do, besides play, will not play lawn tennis and go to the club and such things as that. Mr. Young: I was very much interested in the paper, and I would like to ask Mr. Yager how much of a garden Mr. Courtright has, or how large it is, and how much help he employs. Mr. Yager: I forgot to mention that. While he is a city man, and some of these city fellows have to have a gardener and be high toned, you know, this fellow does it all himself, and tends to it all himself, and his plan is adapted to people of ordinary means. You can be poor and have just as much fun along this line — in the line of flowers and their cultivation, on your little place, or on your little city lot, as John D. Rockefeller can on his estate. I think he has one hundred and forty-four by one hundred and forty-four feet of ground, and tdoes it all himself, and his health is better since he tried it, and his 1 is adapted to the common ordinary people. Ebody is so poor but what they can have some pretty flowers. Once lile he has them to give away to his neighbors, and it does not m anything, and besides it contributes to his general health and piness. The President: We will now hear from Miss Gertrude Rowan, of the Nebraska University School of Agriculture, on the "Food value of fruits." FOOD VALUE OF FRUITS. Gertrude Rowan, University of Nebraska. Ladles and Gentlemen: I hesitated a little to come before the Horti - cultural Society with a paper on the food value of fruits, first because it la a disadvantage to follow a paper of such worth as the one we have Just heard, and secondly I feel that the domestic science clubs and classes, and </seg>
            <seg id="p136">136 cultural Society itself to present such a talk. In talking the matter over with Secretary Marshall, when he asked me if I would not come here this morning, I said I was only too glad to come, and consented, feeling that it is true, that women should receive some instruction before trying to buy fruit, and care for fruit, and pre - serve fruit, and they should not feel as they do feel at the present time, that fruit has no real food value. kin our work over the state, we find that the average housekeeper is the opinion that fruits have no food value, but are only a luxury to be added to the table when there is a little extra money to be spent, or to be put by for some one when they are ill, and not to be used as a regular diet. Beef and potatoes, and beef and potatoes, and coffee boiled today, and reboiled for dinner, and then maybe reboiled the next day, are the accepted diet. If we are to have grapes, oranges, and apples, we must consider whether we need them or not, and whether we want them around the house, to be kept a long time, and how quick they will spoil. So I believe that some educational work needs to be done along the food value of fruits. I do not like to make the next statement, but I know it is true; that when any campaigning of any sort has to be done, the men have to take the initiative. It seems that whenever a measure of any kind for the betterment of us all is at stake, and the solution is necessary, it is for the men to find the way out. In all of our domestic science work we have found that it is the men who are primarily interested in the domestic science work, and we find it Is the men who are working with the school boards, and superintendents, and county commissioners, to get this work into the schools. Not in any specific instance, but in a very general way, that statement is true. Of course you can point to certain cases, at Crete, for instance, where the woman's clubs have taken the start in the domestic science way. JNo person, whether man or woman, has an intuitive ability to make success out of any profession without any training or without the proper foundation. If a man wishes to be a lawyer or a minister, or a good horticulturist; if he is going to be an authority on flowers, or upon one kind of flowers, or apples, then that man makes a study of those flowers, and of those apples, a careful study, reading all he can find on the sub - ject. He attends meetings all over the country and does all that is pos - sible that will make him efficient. Efficiency is the best word that de - scribes the American of the twentieth century, and if that is the case with the man, it should be made to apply to the American woman. If we spend sixteen years fitting girls how to teach school, and prac - tically no time how to keep house, I think there is something wrong. But the girl can go out and teach school, in that little old red school house, for a single term, and she must spend fourteen years in order to be ad- </seg>
            <seg id="p137">137 every two years. With all of the preparation and all of the examina - tions, she just teaches three terms and then goes into a home of her own, with not one day spent in fitting herself for that work, and not one cent of money spent in fitting her for the responsibility she is to as - sume. And so I say in a very general way, when men realize this fact they will realize the need of long training to make the girls proficient in any particular profession they are to take up in the future. Ee men and the women have not realized this, but have felt that as a &gt;f Irving centuries and centuries in the four walls of a home, that make them proficient to assume all the responsibility that they leed for that work. Perhaps you are saying, "What has this to do with the value of fruits as food?" Just this: that when the training of women to make a real profession out of the work they will undertake in the proper handling of their, duties in their future home is a realization, they will realize the food values and so understand that varieties are to be placed upon the table in the average home; they will so realize the need of all of these things from the training they have received in the school, and from the actual experience which they have received, that they will know how to care for and to preserve that fruit, and that they will know that certain foods are essential to the family. You say that you do not believe that. The only thing you have to do is just to display some apples before these men, and make their mouths water, and they will get up the appetite, and as soon as they see that they have a quar - ter they will go and buy apples. It will do all right, to have those apples on display, but create the demand and then you gentlemen will be able to spend all your time at home satisfying this demand. And this demand must be created in the home, and it is up to the housekeepers to do it. It is up to the house - keepers to see that there is a demand for fruits. Just to get enough to eat, or as the small boy says, "Until he is full," that sort of a thing has long gone past. Our American families are spending too much for doc - tor's bills, and then later on realizing that there Is too great a loss of life in this country. There is too great a loss of life in this country, to keep on feeding families in the old slipshod way, giving them anything that happens to be at hand, when it is there, and all they want. When we stop to con - sider the average length of life in this country, and the number of children who never live long enough to go to school, then I think we will realize there is something wrong with the practice we have been using in the feeding of our families, and that there is something to be done in the way of preparing a diet for the table. For instance, the average length of life in this country is thirty-six years and two months. In the state of Iowa, I am quoting Iowa because it was my pleasure to work in that state last year, and because conditions are so nearly the same as they are right here in this state, or in the eastern part of this state, the records showed the same condition existed there. One-fifth of the ' </seg>
            <seg id="p138">138 NEBRASKA 8TATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY entire population never lived long enough to go to school. Just think of that if you will, one-fifth of the population never lived to be old enough to attend school. KDid you gentlemen ever think of it in this way, that if one-fifth of your orchards were dying out, that you would sit idly by and let that work of devastation go on. You certainly would not. What would you do? Why the first thing you would do would be to send to the experi - ment station or the federal department, or to the famous vineyards of Prance if necessary, for experts to come here and solve the problem of why you were not realizing the profits from your orchard. If one-tenth of all the young pigs died every spring, what would happen? Why, the farmers would send to some place for experts to come and see what was the matter with the pigs, and why it was that they could not raise their pigs. But when it comes to the fact that one-fifth of all the population does not live long enough to go to school, then that is a different thing. That is part of another question altogether. It is not part of the running expense of the house, and it does not effect our pocket- P.t is right, but that is not the way to look at it It is on the other e time that something be learned about foods, and that we should that the women should understand something about food values, and the particulars of combining the proper amounts of the right kind of food and placing it before the family at the right time. To do this, the woman requires just as good a knowledge of her work as the young man does to know how much fertilizer to put about the base of a tree, or to know about the feeding of your live stock, or the handling of your orchard, or the raising of your corn. You would not think of feeding a fine dairy cow anything you happen to have on hand any time you want to do so. You do not want frozen corn stalks hauled in every other morning or a wagon load now and then to feed that cow. No, indeed, you are feeding that cow and others if you have them, a certain amount of other things such as oil cake and alfalfa, that you know will be good for her, and you are feeding it constantly and consistently, so that you know you will get a return on your investment, and that the return will be great, for you can not afford to keep that cow on the place and have her for a boarder. If it is necessary for man and the men who are interested in this business to put the subject of feeding stock on a scientific basis; if it is necessary for them to put the subject of raising crops, fruit, and caring for their vineyards and orchards and all those things on a scientific basis, is it not just as necessary to carry that a step further, and follow the fruits up to the house where they are to be prepared for home con - sumption? People are apt to consider that fruits are an extravagance, and that although there is a certain value in them, and that secondly they contain a certain amount of minerals and acids and salts, but they are positive that there is no more real value to them. Have you ever thought of this, that pound for pound, the good old Irish potatoes that we eat every day </seg>
            <seg id="p139">FOOD VALUE OF FRUITS. 139 only gives us two and one-half times as much food value as the apple. Now we find not only that the apples will measure up favorably with the potatoes, but we find in addition to that, what is of more value, and of still greater interest, that apples contain a lot of each of the five food products. In feeding work, we have thought a good deal about food principles. The first of these is protein, or the body-building material, that part of the food that makes the body, or rather the bone and muscle. There is just about 1 per cent of protein in the apple, not enough to make the apple of grea. value along that line. Beefsteak runs about 18 per cent in that matter. Second: The carbo-hydrate is the energy food, that food that makes the body useful in the world, and gives it energy to accomplish some thing. The apple contains about 15 per cent of that special product; the tage shows 15.1 per cent to be exact, and it is enough so that in that the apple has an actual food value. Third: This product is that of fats and oils, and the apple contains only four-tenths of 1 per cent, while the apricot has just a little more, and the grape not so much. Although the apple has not much of this product, not enough in fact to give it a food value in this line, nevertheless it shows that the apple has more than some of our other fruits. Fourth: The next is water, and the apple has 84.2 per cent of just water. "Oh," you say, "if there is so much water, it is an expensive food," and as a matter of fact, they are expensive. But when you come to consider all the phases of food values, they are not so expensive after all. For instance, you pay 12 cents a quart for milk, if you use State Farm Milk, and that milk is 87 per cent water. On the other hand, you are also wrong in the contention of thinking it has no value, for if a food runs largely to water, it does not necessarily mean that that fruit has no value as a food. Milk is 87 per cent water, and yet milk will sustain life a long time, if nothing else is given at all. If you have three quarts of milk a day you need nothing else. There would be too much liquid, of course, and you could not keep on doing your best, but then, just the same, that milk would furnish all the food that you would need. Eggs also are largely water, and twenty-seven eggs a day would furnish all the food you need, without any water or other food. It might break up your bank account at the present price of eggs, but it would sustain life, nevertheless. The fact, then, that apples run as high as 84 per cent of water, does not mean that they do not have an acutual food value. Fifth: Now we come to the salt, ash, and mineral matter of fruits, which is about one-half of 1 per cent. It runs from three-tenths to seven - tenths of 1 per cent. It is very essential, because it is the mineral matter in the fruits that the body must depend on entirely for cleansing. During the winter, when the body is too inactive, and too much in the house, the blood does not run as it should and is sluggish, and then in the spring comes the treatment that takes the place of housekeeper's house cleaning. This fifth element in the apple will give all the cleansing properties that </seg>
            <seg id="p140">140 w( Deeded, And if it was u&amp;ed through nil the year, it would not be neces - sary to have this annual epring cleaning. tA corrective diet will prove to us that the annual spring house clean - ig of the physical system is just as much a necessity and a work of the mes or a relic of the times when we did not realize the difference be - tween foods that were adapted to human consumption, and adapted to the personal system. But you will say in answer that you have been getting along pretty well all these years, and in pretty good shape, and that your wife did not take a course in domestic science, that your daughter has learned from her mother all the things she knows, and that the man who marries your daughter will get the benefits of the training she got from her mother, and they will get along in the same way, and if it waa good enough for you it will be good enough for them. t Think, if you will, of the great number of contagious diseases there in this country today, and in this connection I wish you gentlemen 1 you leave this meeting today would do me one favor. Do this: just ;e hands with one another, and ask the man you shake hands with how he is feeling today, and then hail some other people and ask them. Mr. Brown will say that he is not quite as well as he was yesterday, or not quite as well as usual; Mr. Smith will say that he has a cold, and that he does not seem to be able to get rid of it; another will say that he is suffering from a little gout, and another will say that he had a little neur - algia last night, and did not sleep well, and so on it goes, until you think that everybody has something the matter with them. The very fact that the human machine is not properly oiled,' and properly fueled and given enough water to keep it in condition the average length of time that the human machine should last, shows that we should furnish something to this human machine, and give it the care that it needs. Now if your threshing machine gave you as much trouble as the machine you call your body, you would go right to the agent of another company to trade off the old one, and get a new one in its place. But here is a different question altogether, although in a way the same. You have to live with the human machine, so isn't it worth — if you have to live with it, and put up with it, and endure it — isn't it worth furnishing it with some instruction so it will be able to return to you rthe least amount of nervous energy expended for up-keep the service demand and expect, and serve you the greatest number of years? To illustrate, we need a certain kind of food. We need any food that will make the body do this work, with the least tiring, and when we find the combination of foods that will do this we shall have a food that will make this human machine the most efficient machine we know. I was going to speak about the combinations that the apple could be used in. About the cooking side. But I do not think that is necessary. I will just say one thing, and that is about the making of apple pie, which ■bows that the pie crust increases the fuel values from two hundred and ninety to twelve hundred and seventy calorics per pound. So if you eat </seg>
            <seg id="p141">141 alz hundred calorics in that apple pie. Perhaps the expression of MO calorics does not mean much to us. The ordinary day laborer requires three thousand calorics per day. What is a caloric? It is the heat we get out of the food, — the force. We put potatoes and meat and fruit and various other things into the body, and with a calometer measure the response the body gives. What is the difference between life and death? Just this: in life there is heat, and in death there is absence of heat. And so food is put into the body to keep up this heat; it is necessary in life. We measure this heat in calorics. Apples in pound quantities, or one pound of apples, will furnish two hun - dred and ninety, and one pound of potatoes will furnish eight hundred and twenty, or two and a half times as much. As to the food value of apples, I will say in conclusion that by far the greatest food value of apples if the cleansing effect upon the blood, and the furnishing of mineral material that is necessary to the blood. If it is necessary for you to get the supply of salt for the blood which you know is just as salty as the sea, and it is necessary to get this from the foods you eat, and if fruits furnish this in great abundance, then fruits have this value which any of you can readily see. If for no other reason, Egh we have shown that they have so many other values, if for no reason, fruits are necessary for the minerals they furnish, and the ing properties that they contain. I had hoped this morning to have some little cooking tests, but on looking at the program, I saw you had planned so many other good things, and I thought it would be an imposition upon you to bring up a cook stove into the room, and I thought in the demonstration with apples I would have to be careful as the Winesap man would not like it, if the Jonathan apple cooked up a little bit better than his apple, and the Jona - than man would not like it if the Winesap apple cooked up a little better than this apple, and so on all the way around. I want to thank you for giving me a place on the program, and also for the attention you have given me throughout the talk. DISCUSSION. The President: On behalf of the society I want to thank Miss Rowan for this fine talk, and want to say that I am glad she was here, because from now on I am a suffragette. Rowan: I am not glad I was here, then, because I am not a agette. b Member: I want to ask Miss Rowan a question as to the relative e of the apple in its raw state and its cooked state. What would you mmend as to the proportion to be eaten raw and cooked? I Miss Rowan: I think it depends a good deal on the system. In the r stage the roughage part of the apple predominates. After the apple cooked, that is broken down, the action is not so great in the cooked ale as in the raw apple. Member: How about the skin? </seg>
            <seg id="p142">142 Mlgg Rowan: The food value is not very much in the skin, Mr. Yager: This lady has given us a very nice talk. I recall a few years ago the Ladies' Home Journal offered a prize of four or live hundred dollars to the woman in the United States who would best answer a ques - tion. The question was, "How can a woman retain the love of her hus - band?" Of course they got thousands and thousands of letters from all over the country and some were very long and elaborate, but they kept on receiving the letters, and finally the day came on which they were to decide. Among these they found one reply consisting of three words only, and they said that is a rather short one, but in the end this one finally took the prize, and it read this way, "Feed the brute." And as a matter of fact that is the proposition exactly. She has given us a very good talk along that line, and for years my thought has been just along the line she has suggested this morning, that these girls who put in fourteen or sixteen years learning how to teach school, and are sup - posed to be our future cooks and have no instruction on that line, I predict that the day 1b coming and not far off, when cooking and household eco - nomics will be taught in all the schools, and our girls will learn sewing and cooking and so forth, instead of much they now are taught in our schools. tThe President: As it is only 11 o'clock, I think we have time for re - of the Iowa meeting. Mr. Marshall was a delegate over to the Iowa ticultural meeting, and I think he has a report to make. IOWA HORTICULTURAL MEETING AND FRUIT SHOW. C. G. Marshall, Delegate. F'hat the fruit growers of Iowa are very much awake and enthusiastic horticultural prospects in their state was plain to be seen at the re - meeting of the Iowa State Horticultural Society in Des Moines. The past season, Iowa produced one of the largest fruit crops every grown in the state, and owing to the much improved methods of orchard manage - ment now being practiced by Iowa growers the crop was very profitable in most cases. During the past three or four years rapid strides have been made in Iowa in the practice of spraying, cultivation, pruning and handling of the fruit. Almost every grower of consequence is now thor - oughly spraying, pruning, and cultivating and many are packing according to more up-to-date methods, the box package being used quite extensively. Pit the meeting questions pertaining to the planting, culture, spraying, eting and harvesting, and heating, of orchards on a commercial scale re particularly the apple — seemed to occupy the center of the stage. Iowa State College has done considerable the past two seasons to stimulate commercial fruit growing and to improve the methods prac - ticed. An orchard of more than twenty acres near Council Bluffs is oper - ated by the college under a lease, and a number of experiments will be tried out. Problems of soil fertility, cultivation, spraying, and packing are </seg>

SOME INTERESTING PAPERS. Charles F. Gardner, of Osage, Iowa, gave an interesting paper on his work with strawberries. He told of his experience with several of the new everbearing strawberries; how that from some of these there was a continual production of fruit from the latter part of May until heavy frosts in the fall. One bunch of plants set August 6, blossomed August 30 and ripened fruit October 4 of the same season. He considers the everbearing varieties as valuable acquisitions to the fruit garden in Iowa and especially to the home fruit garden. He emphasized the importance of frequent shal - low cultivation and clean culture for satisfactory results with the ever - bearing kinds. Another interesting paper was by Charles G. Patton, Charles City, Iowa's Burbank and originator of Patten's Greening apple which was, or is, of such great value in the North. He gave some specific directions for breeding plants with the idea of originating new and hardy varieties for the rigorous climate o* northern Iowa, and gave a report of the behavior of certain trees and plants being tested on his trial grounds. Mr. Patten has been working with pears to develop something hardy and blight-proof for the North. The Chinese Sand Pear, which is perfectly hardy and blight - resistant to his grounds, is used as one of the parents in almost all of his plant breeding work. This variety is crossed with the more hardy native pears with the hope that a progeny may be secured having the power to resist the severe climatic conditions of the North, the blight, and the fruit having quality. Prof. N. E. Hansen, of the South Dakota Experiment Station, gave an illustrated lecture showing lantern pictures of a number of the new plums originated by cross-breeding of the natives and cherries and native wild plums with the standard sorts at the South Dakota station. Professor Hansen is doing quite extensive plant breeding work, his aim being to de - velop fruits that will stand forty degrees below zero when the ground is bare and dry. Any hybrids and seedling showing the least injury under the severe weather conditions are destroyed even if the quality of the fruit is superior. Some of his hybrid plums are meeting with approval in the North, the Minnesota Horticultural Society recently recognizing three hy - brids, the "Hanska," the "Opata," and the "Sapa." These varieties will undoubtedly be valuable sorts in northern and western Nebraska where it is difficult to grow the old and standard sorts. On account of their small size as compared with European and Japanese sorts they will probably not find favor where these sorts may be grown successfully. Professor Hansen described them as follows: "Han»ka." — The name is from a Sioux Indian word meaning "tall." It is from the seed of the native wild plum (Prunus Americana) pollenated with the Chinese apricot. It resembles the Chinese parent in form, color, fragrance, quality, and firmness of flesh. Its size is smaller, about 1% </seg>
            <seg id="p144">144 NKHKA8KA STATE HOBTHTI.TUiAI. SO' inches in diameter. The fruit has a heavy blue bloom which is very at - tractive. Trees two and three years old in the nursery row fruited freely. The fruit is solid of flesh like the male parent, and unlike the native which are juicy and soft when ripe. "Opata." — From the Sioux Indian word meaning "bouquet." Its fe - male parent is the Dakota sand cherry and its male parent the Gold plum, a very large Japanese variety originated by Luther Burbank and which sold for $3,000. It is a strong grower and resembles the male parent in form. Fruit buds set freely on one year shoots in the nursery row. It is a trifle smaller than the Hanska, and is dark purplish red with blue bloom. Flesh is green, firm, and subacid, like the sand cherry and with the rich sweetness of the Gold plum. It ripens very early and has no competition on the markets when it ripens in Dakota, July 15. "Sapa." — From the Indian word "black." Its female parent is the western sand cherry and its male parent the Sultan plum, a Japanese variety originated by Burbank. It resembles the male very closely ex - cept in size, being smaller. While this one as well as those described above are not large the pits are exceptionally small, making a large per - centage of the fruit flesh. THE FRUIT SHOW. Pae fruit show was staged in the rotunda of the capitol building, twenty-five thousand plates of apples and over two hundred boxes exhibited. The box display attracted much attention, of which it was very deserving. The large part of the show was made up of the standard winter varieties, with which the Nebraska growers are quite familiar, yet there were a number of summer and fall varieties shown. The following varieties were among those shown in boxes: Willow Twig, Gano, Ben Davis, Jonathan, Roman Stem, Rome Beauty, Sheriff, York Imperial. Genet, Delicious, N. W. Greening, Black Twig, Winesap, and Pewaukee. The exhibitors were very enthusiastic over their experience with the box packages. From talking with several it was learned that 10 to 100 per cent more per bushel was being received from the boxed fruit than from that packed in barrels. A number of seedlings of promise and new varieties were exhibited. The Winter Maiden Blush exhibited by Charles O. Garrett of Mitchell - ville appeared to be a valuable sort not grown in Nebraska, and which it might be well for our growers to investigate. Compared with the Maiden Blush it is larger, of equal appearance, better quality, a late winter keeper, and the tree is said to be hardy, a strong grower, and pro - lific. From our impression of this apple we are inclined to think that it Kid be made a strong rival for the Winter Banana, prized so highly in West and which is not adapted to Nebraska conditions. </seg>

Elost farmers have some wet patches of land on their farms where renty-five or thirty years they have raised nothing but weeds. Had been planted in the early days they would have yielded three hun - dollars' worth of lumber per acre beside an abundance of fuel.

            <seg id="p146">146 Uln of a yearly rental of fifteen dollars per acre per year. Cottonwood groves twenty-fire years old have brought in up to date thirteen dollars par acre in hundreds of instances. Lumber is going up all the time, and yon are sure of fifteen dollars per acre from now on. How much better a thrifty grove of trees would look than a miserable patch of weeds. What shall we plant? The black walnut is a very thrifty tree. It is very valuable, and grows rapidly. It is better to raise from the nuts. Tbeae should be planted near the edge of your wet pieces, where the over - flow will not drown them out. The elm is a good thrifty tree. The Nor - way poplar is probably the best tree and will bring in the most satisfac - tory returns. Notwithstanding the slurs which have been thrown on this tree by those of high authority, yet it is a tree by itself. It has been called identical with the Carolina poplar. The twigs and leaves have some resemblance but the trees are distinct. The Carolina has a rough bark and the Norway a smooth bark. The Carolina seldom lives to be ■ore than fifteen years old; the Norway has been known to live forty years, growing with all vigor. The Carolina is worthless for lumber. Did you ever see a Carolina saw log? A mill man in Minnesota sawed a quarter of a million feet of Nor - way poplar, and he calls it next to white pine in value. It is fine grained and takes on a smooth finish, and looks well dressed in hard oil. It makes good floor boards. It is good for framing timber, being stronger than pine. It is good for boxing and for furniture. We intend to put some specimens of this poplar for our Fociety specimens which will refute for all time the assertion that the Norway is nothing but Carolina. I think it is hardly fair to pounce on a proposition and call it a fraud, and that nurserymen without conscience are fostering and pushing a fake. Nurserymen think something of their reputation, and it is not fair to brand them as dishonest until a thorough investigation has been made. A nurseryman generally does not take the say so of some irresponsible person and go off at half cock before he knows what he is doing. Again, In numerous instances in Manitoba, Minnesota, and the Da - koUa both kinds have been growing side by side. And in a severe winter the Carolinas would be killed to the ground and the Norways would be uninjured. But if you are in doubt and can not readily get the Norway, thai do as the early settlers did, plant cottonwood. You are sure then that your labor will not be in vain. But there are different varieties of cottonwood in the same species. As you go through Nebraska you will find a vast difference in trees. One will be gnarled and tough, and will split about as readily as a bundle of twisted wire. Another tree will be thrifty but it don't exactly suit you. Another has a clean body and a long trunk and is of easy rift. No trouble to split it. In fact, it much resembles the Norway. You want to get scions from that kind of trees and plant them on the largest scale and you are perfectly safe. When farm lands are worth from one to two hundred dollars per acre it is a shame to let any portion go to waste, so plant these moist lands to tree* and let them pump gold from the mud. </seg>
            <seg id="p147">MONEY IN TIMBER 147 Plant and care for the trees a year or so and then you look on and »ee them work for you and they will bring in better returns than you would get from your wheat and oats. Perhaps you are growing old and it is better for you to look on and let those trees do the work. Tears ago there was a Saharah in the heart of France. The winds would drive the sands into great drifts and sometimes whole villages would be enveloped, and you would see church spires sticking out of the sands, telling where a village was buried. A thoughtful man, Bremontier, submitted a plan to Napoleon, and he proposed planting pines in those sands. The great Gen - eral seconded the movement and furnished means for carrying out the plan, which shows what that wonderful genius could have done if he had turned his energies to the arts of peace instead of war. The plan was Kccess, and now the French are shipping lumber, turpentine and resen &gt; those fields of sand — even to the United States. Go from Lincoln to Kansas City some wet summer and see the mil - lions of acres submerged lands — an utter waste. Thirty years from now we might have millions on millions of dollars coming in from lumber grown on those worthless lands. There is going to be a hereafter for Nebraska. It is a glorious state, and every man should do his best to increase her beauty and wealth. Go through our northern and western forests and see the awful ravages of the ax and the fires. Lumber is something people can not live without. Think what the price must be thirty years from now. Again, with the increase of population, unless our lands are made more productive the next generation will have a hard time. How easy It is to plant ten acres of trees and let them grow as a legacy for your children. There was never a more faithful servant than a tree. It never «hirks. It is always working day and night, in sunshine or storm it la faithfully at it Those long slender fingers are reaching through the soil on a foraging expedition gathering food to send up that valveless way, the cambium route between the bark and the tree. How .they distribute their sustenance, feeding leaves and branches and add to the diameter of the trunk. That ceaseless fidelity is marvelous. When such a faith - ful friend stands knocking at your door, ready to give the most faithful service without wages, just give him a chance. DISCUSSION. E.

Mr. Pollard: At the meeting last night I was sorry we were unable to get in communication with Mr. Barnard, but two of the members met with the board. But this was the concensus of the opinion of the two members of the committee that were present with the board. When it came to the question of publicity and the introduction of our Nebraska* fruits into the Nebraska markets, and preventing the shipping in here of Colorado, Washington, and eastern fruits, we thought that the first and the best thing to do was to get our own fruits in condition. We were of the opinion that the way to begin on this matter was to begin at the ground and prevail on the men who have the smaller orchards which constitute the acreage that puts on the market the bulk of the fruit of Nebraska. The commercial orchards on a iarge scale, that are operated by a few men, do not begin to produce the bulk of the fruit. Our idea was to get at those orchards and cultivate them and spray them and prime them, and then we are in a position to go to the people of Nebraska and lay, when this fruit goes on the market, "Here, this is Nebraska fruit, and it la grown in this state, and can not be excelled in any other country in the world." Now, we can do as they are doing, and we have the facilities and so forth, and the plan that was adopted last night, in view of the lateness of the season, and the short time between now and the time necessary to begin this work, we thought of beginning with meetings where we produce, and get at the people of the state in Washington, Cass, and Nemaha counties.

"Mr. C. G. Marshall, Secretary: "Dear Sir — At the Nebraska State Fair, September, 1911, the society kindly gave recognition to a seedling grape I had entered Discretionary under the name of 'Osoeola.' On the tenth day of the present month, In looking over the Grape Culturist by Andrew S. Fuller, published in 1894, I noticed on page 261 he credits Dr. J. Stagman with 'a large white grape' under the name of Osceola. I was not aware there was a grape intro - duced under the name of Osceola at the time I selected the name. The Nebraska State Horticultural Society will prefer I change the name to be different from any already introduced variety. This variety Osceola is a compound hybrid composed of four species as follows: one-fourth Post Oak, one-fourth Rupestris, one-eighth Vinifera, three-eighths La - brusca. With the consent of the society I will ask to have the name Os - ceola changed to 'Santa Anna.' He was president of Mexico about 1834.

But any way, in the article about our meeting I noticed that the State Horticultural Society is not men - tioned in this paper except in small type and with a small letter "h." It seems to me that we have a committee on publicity and it seems to me it should be the duty of this committee to get this before the papers in the right way. It seems to me the paper that was read yesterday by Mr. Keyser, which I think was the best paper that was read before this society in ten years, should have been given a better write up. It has less than three lines, and I think it should be published in full by the State Journal or te other paper.

Cheney, Nebraska. PRUNING APPLE TREES. R. F. Howard, Assistant Horticulturist Nebraska Experiment Station. The writer is of the opinion, after corresponding with practically all of the orchard owners in the state, and after personally inspecting many of the larger orchards in eastern Nebraska, that the trees are suffering more from lack of pruning than from any other one cause; many of the larger growers are now giving their apple orchards the attention they need in so far as spraying is concerned. On the other hand, very few of the commercial orchards, and practically none of the smaller ones, are receiving the attention they need in the matter of pruning. We hear com - plaints on all sides from growers of their orchards not paying; of having to sell their apples for $1 or less per 100 pounds. Until these growers realize that trees allowed to grow unattended will form a mass of water - sprouts and tangled branches, and that nothing but small, gnarled, poorly colored fruits should be expected, they will probably continue to receive the low prices. Spraying, properly done, will do much in producing clean fruit, so far as insect and fungous blemishes are concerned, but it should not be expected to increase the size and color of the crop. Some growers are receiving a fair income from their orchards without pruning. Their success is due to the good cultural care their orchards receive other than pruning, and is attained in spite of, not because of, their neglect in this TRAINING THE YOUNG TRESS An apple tree that has been properly pruned from the time it Is set needs comparatively little attention when it reaches bearing age. When the young tree is removed from the nursery row, probably more than half of its root system is left in the ground. In order to restore this unbal - anced condition and to start the general outline of the head, the first and </seg>
            <seg id="p155">PRUNING APPLE TREE&amp; 155 most important pruning should be given when the young tree is set in the spring. If two-year-old trees are set there will be several lateral branches from 1 to 3 feet long. Three or four of these laterals are enough to form the main branches for the future tree; all others should be removed close up to the trunk. Many of the early growers made the mistake of heading their trees too high. These laterals that are left should be distributed around the tree as well as possible, and should be arranged up and down the trunk at different heights in such a manner that a crotch will not be formed later. These laterals should be cut back at setting time to stubs about 6 inches long and the trunk cut off about 3 or 3% feet above the Fig. 1 ground. If the side branches are left 20 to 30 inches above the ground at setting time, this will be practically the height they will be on the mature Newly set trees should make a rapid growth during the first year. After the first year's growth has been made the trees should be gone over and the tops thinned out. Usually there are a number of branches grow - ing in the wrong direction, and others crossed and interfering with each other, that should be cut out. This is the time to correct poorly shaped heads. A moderate heading in of the long upright branches at this time tends to encourage the development of stronger side branches on the leaden. </seg>
            <seg id="p156">156 . The third and fourth seasons' pruning should aid in retaining the general shape of the head that is already started. Cut out all water - sprouts, remove crowded branches as well as those crossed and growing in the wrong direction, and head in any particularly long leaders. RENEWING NEGLECTED APPLE TREES. One of the problems that confronts the growers in Nebraska is how to renew their old neglected trees, how to get them thinned out and properly shaped bo they will bear large, well-colored fruits instead of the half-sized. poorly colored crops tbat they are now producing. There are two or three things necessary to bring this about: First, the trees themselves must be relieved of a great portion of their wood. This should be done in such a Fig. 2. way as not to unbalance the tree. Where it is necessary to take out a great portion of the old wood in renewing old apple trees it is probably better to distribute the pruning over a period of two or three years. If in order to get the tree properly thinned out it is necessary to remove one - third of the wood, great care should be taken to distribute the cutting equally throughout the top, and not simply take out a few of the larger </seg>
            <seg id="p157">157 Re 1 represents an average condition one may expect a tree to be age of eighteen or twenty years if left to grow unattended. It impossible to spray a tree in this condition. Figure 2 shows the same tree after it has been properly pruned. The large pile of prunings gives an idea of the amount of wood that was removed. Note that this was not obtained by merely cutting out a few large limbs. The entire top was relieved until there were no crossed, rubbing, or crowded branches. Too often one is prone to cut out three or four large branches and let it go at that. This may be needed, but the tree is scarcely half pruned when this Is done. A few large branches properly selected and removed will open up the crowded center and will relieve the tree of some of its surplus wood. These things are needed, but when this is done see to it that the outer portion of the tree is thinned out. After all, here is where most of the fruit is borne. Take the shears and clip off branches from an inch down to the size of a lead pencil all over the outer part of the tree until it presents an open appearance such as you have given the center by removing the large branches. It may be neces - sary to use the ladder for this part of the pruning. Figure 3 represents another condition that is entirely too common in Nebraska orchards. This tree has not only been in sod most of its life, neglected generally, but it has been allowed to grow too high. It is very difficult to spray the top of such a tree and to harvest the fruit is next to impossible. Trees of this type may be brought back into profitable bear - ing with the proper treatment. What this tree needs is to have its top lowered several feet, to have a considerable portion of its old wood taken out, and to stimulate it into a more vigorous growth. When one attempts to lower the top of an old apple tree by "dehorning" it he should be careful to cut back to a good healthy side branch for a feeder to avoid leaving a stub. The cut should be made slantins so as not to hold water. When it is necessary to cut away a considerable portion of the wood at a single operation a rank growth of water sprouts is apt to be induced the follow - ing year. It is very important that a severe pruning be followed up the next year by removing these, in order to throw the growth into the bearing wood that has been left. While an apple tree may be pruned most any time during the year, there are certain advantages in doing it during the dormant season — that is, any time after the leaves drop in the fall and before growth begins in the spring. Other work is not so pressing at this time, and one can see better what he is doing than if the leaves were on. If the pruning is done during winter a great amount of spray material is saved and a much better job of spraying is made possible. The cuts should be made up close to avoid leaving a stub. Larger wounds will be made, but they will heal over more readily than if cut farther out. All cut surfaces of over an inch in diameter should be painted over. Most any paint will answer this purpose, but white lead mixed with raw linseed oil is recommended. </seg>
            <seg id="p158">158 tMany of the old orchards in Nebraska have been in sod for twenty ■s or have been used for calf or bog pastures until they are not making e than an inch or two growth each year. Pruning will tend to invigor - them some, but if the land is not too rolling they should be broken up given clean cultivation for a few years. If the sod is too heavy to be ked up with a disc, a shallow plowing followed with a disc and harrow Fig. 3. will get them into shape to take in and hold the moisture. Clean cultiva - tion should not be practiced until the soil is so depleted of its humus that it will wash. What we want is to keep the trees growing, hold as much of the moisture as possible, and see that the soil is not robbed of all its humus and plant food. POSSIBILITIES OF THE WILD FLOWER GARDEN. - Frank G. Pellett, Atlantic, Iowa. I Many of our finest wild flowers are in danger of extermination. It •y unfortunate that the present generation should have been so mad pursuit of wealth, as to have no time or interest to preserve the mo iirable things with which a virgin country was provided. Our wi ds have been slaughtered mercilessly and thoughtlessly, until a numb Bpecies have been extirpated and several more are threatened wit inction unless the public shall promptly recognize the importance ir protection. Our forests have been sacrificed to the greed of me gold. And now the wild flowers are threatened with a similar fate ugh they can not be directly turned to cash. In the case of the flowers i fact that men think that land must pay dividends is putting eve lilable acre to the production of some cash-returning crop, and crowdin i wild flowers off the earth. </seg>
            <seg id="p159">THE WILD FLOWER GA1. 159 Prsons who love flowers are so situated that they lack either the inclination to fuss with the ordinary garden flowers, or the ig plants. Such persons, as well as those interested in saving &gt;rts, will find a wild flower garden a most interesting diver- It Is quite possible to have flowers throughout the season from early April until killing frosts in October. Of course, to accomplish this result requires a large variety of flowers, but there is an abundance of those which are desirable to fill in the entire season if one has only the proper situation in which to plant them. The woodland plants, of course, require conditions somewhat similar to those provided by nature, but if one has a grove this is easily provided. Our own wild garden is planted in a bit of native woods that furnished the barn lot to a former owner of the place. When we arrived we soon decided that it could be put to better use, so the barn was moved away and a fence placed about the lot to keep out all live stock. In this prairie region many may lack the proper shade, but groves will soon grow and the wild flowers will thrive even among small trees if the weeds are not allowed to crowd them out. Here in Iowa there is a much greater danger of the extermination of the wild flowers than in timbered regions where there is a considerable amount of waste land, so that it behooves nature lovers to put forth an effort to preserve our native flora. Our earliest bloom comes from bloodroots followed by Dutchman's breeches. Trillium is earlier, but in our locality it seems to be entirely exterminated. The Dutchman's breeches are just at their best when the adder-tongues come in great abundance. Hardly have these faded when literally thousands of violets make an attractive display. We have both the blue and yellow varieties in large numbers. Yellow buttercups are next in order, and we have enough to give splendid mass effects. Then comes the wild phlox and Virginia waterleaf, also in quantity. Then there is a liberal showing of Jack-in-the-Pulpit, Solomon's seal, and many others. We have scoured the country in search of columbine and now have several fine clusters. This is one of the wild plants seldom seen outside of gardens in our country now. The azure larkspur is a One wild flower of other days; so far I have been able to find only one wild speci - men. The wood lily on the list of those becoming rare is a treasure in the wild garden. May apples, once abundant in this section, are now rapidly disappearing. Space will not permit the enumeration of all the attractive wild flowers that fill in the season, but with a little care in selecting one can have a succession of bloom from April until October. Midsummer varieties are not so numerous, yet they are by no means scarce. The starry campion blooms in July, and with its pyramidal panicles of white bells it is not overshadowed by the finest creation of the florists' art. The cup plant and a number of similar showy plants bloom at this season. White snake-root and asters make a grand display at the end of the season, literally coming out to meet Jack-Frost Of shrubs there is quite a long list of desirables such as sumach, elder- </seg>

I By going to the undisturbed woods and transplanting as they grow it easy to produce a natural harmony. While the first labor of establish - ; a garden of this kind is considerable, after it is once established it julres a minimum of care. The early plants, like the bloodroots, bloom Fore the appearance of those that shall later shade the ground. We ve first a mass of bloom from adder-tongues and Dutchman's breeches, lowed by violets, the buttercups, and later phlox and waterleaf, as well others, and last of all the asters, all on the same ground, and each sdu to occupy it fully at the time of flowering. It is surprising bow my varieties can be grown together, harmoniously, many, like the wild iger, hiding away under the leaves of more showy plants. It is worth while to save the wild flowers. FRUIT GROWERS' INSTITUTES. Val Keyser, Lincoln. The success of the annual meeting of the State Horticultural Society held in Lincoln, January 16, 17, and 18, caused unusual interest among Nebraska apple growers. The splendid quality of the eastern Nebraska apples on exhibition at the winter fruit show prompted the society to take •Mae concerted action to interest a larger number of growers in the pro - duction of better apples. After a lively discussion of a paper on the "Quality of Nebraska Apples," a publicity committee was appointed by the society consisting of E. M. Pollard of Nehawka, G. A. Marshall of Arlington. C. H. Barnard of Table Rock. This committee was instructed to devise ways and means for encouraging the orchard owners of eastern Nebraska to give their orchards better care, looking to the production of a greater quantity of high class market apples. The committee was further instructed to give publicity to the merit of these apples in order that the public might become acquainted with the superior quality of apples produced in eastern Nebraska. The committee got busy at once, and arranged three mass meetings of fruit growers, which were held at Blair. Washington county; Platts - mouth, Cass county; and Peru. Nemaha county. Remarkable interest and enthusiasm were shown by the growers at each of these points. Forty - eight were present at the Washington county meeting, twenty-six at Plattsmouth, and 120 at Peru. §The writer represented the Horticultural Society at these meetings I Prof. R. F. Howard, from the University, attended as a representative the Nebraska Experiment Station. Considering the fact that these meetings were gotten up and adver - tised on short notice, the attendance was remarkable, and in a measure expresses the interest which has been awakened in apple growing in this </seg>

These associations are organ - ized for educational purposes. The State Horticultural Society and horti - cultural department of the experiment station will be called upon for assistance in the different phases of orchard management. The chief work to be conducted during the present season will be the renewing of neglected orchards. Demonstrations in proper methods of pruning the trees will be the first step taken. Arrangements are being made in several places to conduct the experiment of community spraying. Pro - fessor Howard, in his address before these meetings, offered to take charge of this spraying work, by communities, if a number of the growers owning small orchards would Join in buying a power outfit and furnishing spraying material. The work will not only include assistance in pruning and spraying, but also cultivation of the orchards will be directed, and later instruction will be given in harvesting the crop of apples. The exhibit of boxed apples at the winter fruit show has created a demand for apples in box packages, and the growers are planning to hire an expert box packer to give instruction in this method of packing for the market. It is the general opinion of those interested in the development of Nebraska resources that the Horticultural Society has started a move - ment which will be fruitful of much good. Arrangements are being made El communities in the counties where meetings have already been also in nearly every county where apples are produced on a com - il scale similar meetings will be conducted. No attempt was made at these meetings to effect a commercial organ - ization. The speakers were merely starting an educational campaign, trying to instruct and encourage the owners of small orchards to apply up-to-date methods in caring for their apple trees. The importance of vigorous pruning was insisted upon. The first step in caring for the average neglected orchard is to prune out at least one-half of the wood from the tops of the trees. In removing the branches the cuts should be made close to the trunk and larger limbs, and all wounds larger than half an inch in diameter should be painted. Professor Howard wag emphatic in his demands that this pruning must be done, and stated that he would not attempt to spray an orchard unless the trees were properly pruned. The importance of the first spraying, while the trees were dormant, was also urged by the speakers. For this purpose the standard 4-4-50 or 6-6-50 solutions of Bordeaux mixture were strongly recommended. LBy a series of charts such apple diseases as scab, blotch, and apple ker were explained. That these diseases could be controlled by the intelligent use of Bordeaux mixture and line-sulphur was one of the chief points impressed upon the growers. Because unsprayed apples the past two seasons were comparatively free from these diseases it should not be taken as evidence that the diseases would not appear in troublesome form in seasons of greater rainfall. The speaker also tried to impress u Don t ho srowGrs th&amp;t sorii vinE w&amp;s r dtp vpnt i vp snd not &amp; cure for « </seg>

The use of Bordeaux mixture for the first spraying while the trees were dormant was advised, and all the later applications the use of lime-sulphur to prevent later infection from disease and to give rich color to the apples, was recommended. Four sprayings were recom - mended, emphasizing the fact that the second spraying with lime-sulphur and lead arsenate, to prevent disease and apple worms, which is applied just after the petals have fallen, was the most important application of spray material throughout the growing season. Thorough cultivation, to break up the usual soddy condition of the orchard, was urged by the writer, who has had much experience with the orchard disc. Those who have orchards planted on rolling land were cautioned against careless cultivation. It was suggested that cultivating orchards was not always necessary, and that the amount of cultivation should be governed by the kind of season, lay of land, and character of The speakers were strong in their conviction, which was backed by practical experience in apple growing, that one acre of apple trees prop - erly cared for would produce greater annual returns than five acres sown to any of the ordinary farm crops. An annual profit of $100 per acre was the lowest estimate put upon the average orchard over twelve years of age In eastern Nebraska, and the writer told of his and Mr. Marshall's experience in the Weeping Water orchard during the past year in pro - ducing a yield of 500 bushels per acre, which would have sold in the orchard for 50 cents per bushel. tNo Illustrations were drawn of what might be accomplished in east- Nebraska, but the speakers confined their discussions to actual exam - of orchards which are being properly cared for in this section of state. The necessity of equipping the orchard with artificial heat to save the buds at blooming time was also pointed out. A keen interest was expressed in orchard management, from the pruning of the trees to the harvesting and marketing of the crop. At Peru Mr. Duncan, who was in charge of the meeting, had arranged for a pruning demonstration, and the audience of over 100 marched to an orchard in the edge of town through a snow storm, and insisted upon watching a demonstration in pruning an apple tree before they would adjourn. The Interest manifested was a happy surprise to the speakers, and if anything can be gathered from the questions asked, the State Horticul - tural Society and Experiment Station will be kept busy during the follow - ing summer supplying needed information and assistance to the apple growers of eastern Nebraska. If there Is a disposition to clean up the old orchards and put them under modern methods of orchard management, a commercial organiza - tion to assist the grower in handling and in marketing the fruit is </seg>

Ei purpose of the home garden is to give an abundance and variety for the family table as well as for the market. There is no place farm where a man can get as large returns for his labor and time as in the garden. This is the place where every member of the family may work more or less; and no one need be ashamed of it as long as they get a living from it. Implements used in the working of the garden and the work itself seem degrading to many people throughout the country today. This is true especially among the younger people. To my mind, where children are taught what to do with the earth and how to do it, it is as valuable training as any we can give them. Before rural life will take a better turn, labor, no matter what it is, should be held in more esteem. Even a garden implement should be looked at by every member in the family as an implement of honorable and profitable and health-giving industry. The impression that working in the garden is degrading has led many away from the farm. To many people today work of any kind is a burden. No home garden can be a success unless work is put on it. A well-kept home garden on the average farm or vacant city lot makes life more pleasant and breaks the monotony of dwelling too much Inside of the house. That is why a garden should be located close to the house. Either fence the chicken lot or the garden. On my farm I fence the chicken lot. Then, if I want the chickens in the garden I can have them there in short order. I let them out in the evening before they go to roost, before and after the growing season. They can have all the range they want. We have found that this pays on our small farm; on larger farms a different system might be more profitable. In the fall and winter up to New Tear's, on the average farm, hens are on strike. In giving them a fresh pasture in the fall, we get almost as many eggs as in the spring, and sell them at a higher price. During the growing season we feed the chickens over the fence what we can't use ourselves. The little chicks can have the run of the garden to pick up worms and bugs. They won't do any damage while small, and when they grow larger the fence won't let them through. The home garden needs rotation just as much as any other part of the farm. That is the reason I don't have a fenced garden, although if a garden is fenced the space along the fence may be used for small fruit, rhubarb, asparagus, horse radish, and winter onions. It is difficult for me to say how much land the home garden should contain. The size of the family influences this, and also the care given the garden, for some can get more out of a square foot than others out of a square rod. If possible, have the garden patch longer than broad. This means much in getting around with a horse. Plant the stuff in rows, not in beds, for this will save a good deal of backache. </seg>
            <seg id="p164">164 Plant vegetables that mature at the same lime and grow to the same height near each other. Rows 3 feet apart permit a horse to work be - tween them. Some vegetables should be planted in rows only 14 to 16 Inches apart. These require a wheel hoe or hand work. As I have already stated, have perennial vegetables at one side or along the fence, for this saves time in plowing the garden. ' The garden should be plowed in the fall. First clean up all dead vines and rubbish and burn it. This will get rid of many enemies of your crops. Spread about twelve to fifteen loads of well-rotted manure evenly on the land. I have put as much as twenty-five loads to the acre of the right kind of manure and have found no bad effect on the crops so long as moisture is not lacking. t Freezing and thawing of plowed ground during the winter settles pulverizes the soil and makes an ideal home for vegetables to grow Fall plowing gets rid of many insects. Let the poultry follow behind plow; they will manufacture the insects into eggs. tWhen the land is plowed late in the fall not much is gained by running sc or harrow over it; I would rather leave it rough to catch snow, there is not much evaporation going on during the winter months. I n spread well-rotted manure over the rough fall-plowed ground, then the disc or harrow in the early spring just before planting. This -rotted manure worked in on top of the soil gives the young plants a er start than the manure at the bottom of the furrow where the roots unable to reach it in their early growth. (In planting a garden, attention must be given to the feeding capacity the plants, the time to plant, season's growth, and time to harvest for illy use or market. Any retarding of the growth during the growing ge of most of our vegetables means poor quality, uneatable, woody bit - ness, lacking in taste, toughness, instead of tenderness. The condition vegetables never improves after taking from the garden, although the ce increase* as they pass from one hand to the other until they reach &gt; consumer. In the thorough preparation of the seedbed and its cultivation lies the secret of success, and the neglect of these factors is the cause of many failures. This is more true in this country than in Europe, where I spent twenty years in intensive farming. Our soil Is just as productive as the European soils if we apply the same intensive system of cultivation and give the same time to caring for the seedbed. kTtae real value of our products, however, depends upon the market, farmers of this country would do well to study the cooperative sys - &gt; of marketing, selling and buying that prevail in European countries. Fourteen years of experience in growing vegetables and fruit of all kinds in southeastern Nebraska for home, market, and exhibition shows me that I have to lay aside much that I learned from an experienced man on the other side of the globe. In growing vegetables of good quality the time to grow them is short because we have very abnormal condi - tions to overcome. Even with the best of care, climatic conditions often </seg>
            <seg id="p165">GROWING GARDEN CROPS. 165 prevent us from bringing certain vegetables to maturity and at the same time have quality. Appearance and quality are what goes in the market. It has often been demonstrated In my work that a stoppage of growth injures the quality. This may be caused by a dry spell during the hot days with a temperature of 110 degrees. If at such times we could move our vegeta - bles under some shade tree with plenty of water and keep the hot wind off, lettuce would not taste bitter, radishes would not have that sharp taste, table beets would not be stringy, and turnips would not have that unpleasant flavor. In the season just past, late potatoes came to a standstill during the dry weather. Then rain came and started them, again making a second growth. We heard of some good yielding plats, but quality was never mentioned. Some of the potatoes grown under those conditions may be boiled all day, and you may fix them up any way you can, and they are not as good as if they had had continuous growth; the starch is not there. Unfavorable conditions of growth seem to be the greatest cause of poor quality in vegetables, and very often the most practical men 'have no control over these conditions. Yet many of the problems have been solved in the past, and many more will be solved In the future if we will put our heads into the game. We learn greater lessons in unfavorable seasons than in favorable ones. In favorable seasons the thing that more than anything else con - trols quality and yield is the plant food in the soil. In a favorable season we almost believe Nebraska is a second paradise. Yet great losses are going on every year in the vegetable and home gardens of Nebraska. Much of the loss is caused by insects and plant disease. In dry seasons, like the last two years, insects of all kinds are particularly abundant In extreme wet seasons we find plant diseases abundant. In the average season both insects and plant diseases are at work. Rotation is one of the best safeguards to control these pests. All kinds of sprayers are advertised, but my choice is the dust sprayer. Dust sprays will adhere where wet sprays will not. Dust sprays not only con - tain a poison to kill insects, but help to close the pores through which the insects breathe, applied when plants are dry. Each family of vegetables has its peculiar enemy, but by constant changing of the soil the grower can control them to a large extent. That is why I don't like a fenced garden whose location can never be changed. A change to clover or alfalfa would help to improve many home gardens, or a crop of cowpeas would answer the same purpose. Too many gardens are planted in the spring and neglected throughout the remainder of the season. It seems that the gardens always need to be weeded when a ball game is going on in town; they need weeding on Saturday afternoon. Fourth of July or some holiday. Certain work has to be done in the garden before the boy or girl can go to the circus. Oftentimes the boy gets there after the parade, and just about the time the last elephant enters the tent. Boys treated that way have no use for a garden, and more than one has left the farm. </seg>
            <seg id="p166">166 In some seasons conditions are favorable to growing more than one rop on the same piece of land. Some time ago I gave my system of com - panion cropping in the Nebraska Farmer. Crops that mature at different mes may be planted together. This system gives the largest returns rom the soil if it is rich enough and there is plenty of water to draw pon during the growing season. Weeds have no chance to get a foothold nder this system, and it makes a man believe that Nebraska is as good as any place. If each vegetable has its own peculiar enemies, and the insects on the different vegetables are enemies to each other, which I know from observation to be true in many cases, then if we can find out what insects are enemies to each other and group the plants on which they live, insects could fight out their own battle. For instance, on early turnips we always find a great many lady - ugB. You may plant a row of cucumbers next to the turnips. When le cucumbers come up the yellow-striped cucumber bug makes his home tere; likewise on watermelons, muskmelons, and squashes. If these triped bugs leave any of your vines, then the lice will come and enter te leaves of the vine crops and get away with a few more plants if they are left alone. Now, I have to take care of the yellow cucumber bug; ut the lady-bug will get away with the lice so long as any turnips are grown nearby. How about the squash vine borer? He does his work after the cu - cumber beetle gets through. He lays his eggs in the vines right above the surface of the ground. The vines will grow from five to ten feet and young squashes may be formed; then we notice the vines begin to die when the squash is half grown. On pulling up the vines we find a large worm in the stalk. How are you going to get the bug that lays the egg which produces the worm? You can't always kill him, but you can fool him providing you get acquainted with him to know how he looks. You will find him around the vines when the young plants have their second pair of leaves. Kill him then. Spraying don't always get him. If you want to scare him place some cotton saturated with carbon bisulphide around the young vines and repeat it whenever needed. If you want to fool him plant the squashes among the pumpkins, then remove the pumpkin vines afterwards. Again, you can foil this worm by covering the vines with some soil so the vines will have a chance to make new roots and bring the fruit to its maturity in spite of the worm in the main stalk. What an acre of land will produce in financial returns depends a good eal on where it is located. The home market is the best market in the world if one can be established. Farther away from the railroad and markets the products have to pass through the hands of express com - panies and middlemen, and the producer's profit is largely absorbed. An acre of land distant from the market may outyield in quantity and quality, and yet give returns of only $50, where an acre close to the market gives </seg>
            <seg id="p167">167 Nebraska has just as many good garden acres as any other state. Carloads upon carloads of vegetables and small fruit are shipped into Nebraska right where the land is adapted to the growing of these prod - ucts. Many a man, if he would put his individuality into it, could make vegetable growing pay in this State. The man who has the natural instinct and who studies to know the adaptation of crops in his locality, how to prepare the land, how to plant, what varieties to grow, when to cultivate, harvesting, marketing, storing for winter, will make good anywhere so long as there are hungry people and the cost of living increases. Such a man has opportunities for beyond the average man, but as soon as some of the important parts of the busi - ness have to be turned over to the hired help the "stuff's all off." It takes just as much care to market a crop as it does to grow It I have always taken the liberty and claimed the right to make the price on my own stuff direct to consumers. With merchants, I do the same. During my fourteen years of experience in this locality I have come in contact with only one merchant who held the selfish idea that he ought to make both prices for me — on what I was selling as well as on what I was buying. He and I did not do business very long. It is always well to consider the season when stuff is produced. I have received from 22 cents up to $3 per bushel for potatoes; for cabbage, from 1 cent per pound up to 5 cents per pound; for tomatoes, from 1 cent up to 12% cents per pound; for early turnips, from % ct. up to 3 cents per pound; for small fruits, from (1.25 per crate up to $3.50 per crate. In some seasons prices go to the extreme both ways. A general market is the home grower's protection. Free mail deliv - ery brings us the daily market reports on all produce. I have never sold potatoes at 5 cents per pound to farmers, nor tomatoes at 12 Vi cents per pound. These extreme prices are always charged retail stores and were copied from St. Joseph and Omaha markets. The home grower, tman who makes a specialty in growing his stuff for the early market l an "off" year when the average garden fails, should get the benefit The point I want to make clear is this: If my vegetables or small fruit in off seasons come to market in just as good condition and of just as good quality and fresher than that shipped in from a distance, why should it not be worth as much to the merchant or consumer? The old saying is that "the early bird catches the worm." This may be truly applied in growing stuff for the early market ten or twelve days ahead of the rush. This gives the home grower, the specialist, a corner on any - thing that is shipped in. The home grower who wishes to produce early vegetables will find that it will pay him to keep his soil rich and use some nitrate of soda to force the crops along. There are three reasons for this: First, It gets the crops to early market when prices are high; second, it gets the crop out of the way of dry weather; and third, out of the way of insect peats. </seg>
            <seg id="p168">168 food to the plants in the quickest way and most available form instead of allowing plants to hunt for it. That is intensive farming. One point I want to touch upon is the general complaint in Nebraska hat it is often too dry; then again too wet. These changes have much o do with the growth of plants. In the spring the sun warms the soil, and this, with the moisture and other agencies, works upon the humus to roduce plant food or nitrates. During the wet season, with heavy, fre - uent rains, much of this prepared plant food is washed lower down in he soil where the roots of the young plants can not get a hold of it. A rust forms on top of the soil after a rain, shutting out air, and prevent - ng the formation of plant food. So we see that water in the soil, soil emperatures, and soil aeration all have a bearing on vegetable growth. As a boy I remember well that after a rain we fertilized our growing rops with a liquid manure prepared in large cement tanks. We irrigated ur garden directly from those tanks, always after the rain. On meadows, rom five to seven cuttings of grass were made. The last growth was left s a mulch for winter. I could not always see the why or the wherefor ' this. I was simply told to do it and saw the results. I was not told lat this liquid manure replaced the nitrates that the rain had leached way from the roots of the plants or the plants had used up. We all do many things on our farms today because they bring results, tut are unable to explain to others why we do them that way. Some of us can do things better than we can tell about them, but I don't object to hat so long as they are getting results. However, a man will lean; very owly by his own experience alone. I know that some farmers make fun ! a book or a farm paper article, but the experienced man can almost ways tell if it comes from the pen of the practical man. The experi - nced man is able to gather something from such articles where "igno - ramus" won't. A man will learn little out of a paper or book unless he the grower's instinct. We hear so much of that "back to the land" movement. I don't take much interest in it. I think we can spare a few more to the town when comes to vegetable gardening and still be able to feed them. Give the armer and producer better means and cheaper transportation, as they have in Europe, and we will still be able to keep them all. There is no se to make a special effort to get people out of the city. If they possess le instinct, have the desire, and are able to raise the capital they will go ut themselves. To my mind, many of them would not last longer than snowball in the hot summertime. Half the people living in the country have never discovered the real yielding capacity of the land. The average farmer has never even dreamed of it. This holds true of the family garden as well as to other crops. Last winter while in Columbia, Mo., I was shown the great cow Josephine. Fifty-two quarts of milk a day was her highest record. Were our cows all Josephines, with care and breeding behind them, we would need only a few, and then a windmill and pipeline would furnish all the milk needed for a good sized town. </seg>

SPRAYING THE APPLE ORCHARD. C. G. Marshall. There are many different insects and fungous diseases that do injury to apple trees and their fruit in Nebraska. The two most troublesome are the apple scab and codling moth worm, one a disease and the other an insect. In controlling these two most troublesome pests the many others are caught incidentally, so that these two are all that It is necessary to keep in mind when spraying. It ts not necessary to go into details as to the life histories of these pests, or to take up and discuss at length the advantage of fighting them. The fact that our orchards are infested with these pests confronts us, and the question is how to successfully combat them with the least trouble and expense. We are not so much concerned about how they Einto the country and how they are perpetuated as we are about and when they work and the sprays to use in fighting them succeaa- The necessity of making this phase of the orchard work a part of the plan in carrying out the details connected with growing of good fruit has been emphasized by the many experiment station publications, and by the agricultural press in general. It is recognized by the up-to-date fruit grower and farmer as a feature of the work connected with successful fruit culture that is just as important as cultivation and pruning. In fact, the commercial apple grower in many sections would rather dispense with, for a single season, either cultivation or pruning, or both, than with spraying. P&gt;ple scab is a disease that develops on the leaves, flowers, and fruit the wetther conditions are favorable. It starts to grow in the s as soon as they are open if damp, cool weather prevails, making weak and easily killed by spring frosts, and it also weakens the stems, causing the fruit to dropoff badly after it has set. In addition to this injury the fruit may be affected and marred badly by the time It reaches maturity. On account of dry weather scab has been unusually scarce in Nebraska the past two seasons. Almost every season of ordi - nary rainfall it is very troublesome and should be guarded against every season. Two materials may be used to control the scab. Bordeaux mixture and lime-sulphur. Lime-sulphur is less apt to burn or russet the fruit and leaves, and is now usually preferred. A common test for the com - mercial product is 32 degrees Baurae. This should be diluted about 35 times with water. Bordeaux mixture is made by slaking 4 pounds of quick lime in a little water and diluting to 25 gallons, then combining </seg>
            <seg id="p170">170 t25 gallons of water in which 4 pounds of coppor sulphate has been lved. Lead arsenate, 2 pounds to 50 gallons of water, Is recommended for controlling the apple worm. It may be added to the dilute fungicide, making a combination mixture effective against both insects and diseases. Apple flowers In different stages of development. Figure 1 shows when to make the first spraying, and figures 3 and 4 when to make the second spraying. The stage shown In figure 2 is somewhat early and that in figure S somewhat late for the second spray - ing, while at the stage shown in figure 6 no poison can be forced into the calyx cup. </seg>
            <seg id="p171">171 CALENDAR FOR APPLICATIONS. k First Spraying: Directed against apple scab. — After the cluster buds i, but before the individual flowers open. Should be directed against trunk and main limbs also. Use lime-sulphur or Bordeaux mixture, i figure 1.) Usually about April 20. Second Spraying: Directed against both apple scab and codling moth worm. Very important. — Just as soon as the ground begins to appear white from falling petals. Do not delay this application. Use a rather coarse nozzel and direct the spray downward as much as possible with high pressure. It is importtnt that the poison be driven into the flowers before the calyx lobes close. (See figures 2 to 4.) t Third Spraying: Directed against apple scab and codling moth worm, bout 21 days after the second spraying to guard against fungous dis - ;s and to control the late hatching worms. Use the same material as the second spraying. t Fourth Spraying: Against apple scab and codling moth worms. — This application is made late in July (15th to 20th), and is directed mainly against the second brood of worms. It is also sometimes very important against apple scab. If the season is dry and no sctb is apparent, the fun - gicide may be omitted, using 2 pounds of lead arsenate to 50 gallons of water. PLANNING AND ADORNING THE FARMSTEAD. A. T. Erwin in Bulletin 126, Iowa Experiment Station. Neat, conveniently arranged buildings, a well-kept lawn attractively bordered with trees and shrubs add greatly to the appearance and value of the farm and to the happiness of its occupants. The farmstead* including as it does the general area occupied by the farm buildings, house and lawn, is the center of activity for the farm. Its planning and development, both from the standpoint of convenience and of securing an attractive landscape effect, deserve special consideration. A well-thought-out plan is the first requisite to get these results, as in e absence of a definite scheme serious mistakes are likely to be made. lis plan should include the location of buildings, drives, walks, trees, lrubbery, and every other feature which contributes either to the con - enience or ornamentation of the place. It should be developed with the arger relationships always in mind. The location of the house and farm uildings is the first consideration. Even though It happens that some of ese are already on the ground, a plan for their location is important. ew farm homes are erected to supplant old ones and other new farm ructures ace added, which make practicable a general consideration of te entire building scheme. Material improvement can often be made in a farmstead by a readjustment as new buildings are put up, though he best results are obtained where things are planned right from the I In selecting a site for the house, good drainage is the first requisite, south or east slope is generally to be preferred, while a north slope is </seg>
            <seg id="p172">172 ndesirable. In its location, give the house the greatest prominence, he farmstead first of all provides a home, and the residence should stand ut as the central and most conspicuous feature of the picture. To place te barn and other buildings in front of the house Is to reverse the logical der pf things. Locate the bouse back far enough from the highway to ford privacy and give a good stretch of lawn in front, and yet not so far tack as to suggest a spirit of exclusion, nor with a lawn so large that it can not be properly cared for. Most city dooryards are too small, while ose in the country are so large that it is impracticable to give them lawn reatment. I The location and grouping of the general farm buildings is a perplex - problem, and each place presents its own peculiar conditions and Iculties. The most common mistakes occur in the location of buildings to convenience. The corn crib should be located near the particular ting place that will call for the bulk of its supply, and the toolshed ere the implements can be taken up or dropped en route to or from field. In this connection the importance of providing enough shed m for the tools and general equipment needs emphasis. The promiscu- Bcattering of machinery about the barnyard always gives a place an of carelessness and neglect and detracts much from its appearance, le the weathering of the machinery causes a serious economic loss. ■ watering trough and workshop call for a central location. The general farm buildings should be to the rear of the farm house, and the stable at least 150 or 200 feet away. Locate them to avoid odors being carried to the house by the summer winds. So far as practicable, arrange the farm buildings to serve as a windbreak. Locate the yards on the side farthest from the house, though it is often an advantage to provide a paddock near the highway for the display of the farm herds. The business side of the farm must not be lost sight of, and special features of the general building equipment may be given prominence, such as the seed house or any other important feature of the place. In landscaping the farmstead it is not the idea to obscure their presence, but rather to secure an orderly arrangement of the buildings and to have the front side to the front and the back side to the rear.

It gives to the place a dignity and individuality that is otherwise lacking. Iowa now has a law permitting the registration of farm names and affording legal protection therefor. Keep all other signs off. The use of farm buildings as billboards for the advertising of tobacco, etc., is cheapening. It not only detracts from the looks of a place, but is an illogical thing to do. The owner should work up a reputation for his own goods and advertise his own products in an appropriate way. Since the majority of the country people ride rather than walk, there is little demand for front walks, which are wholly a matter of con - venience rather than beauty. When built, they should lead in the direc - tion people desire to go. Long, circuitous routes around a semi-circle are unnatural and do not represent good planning. It has been suggested that the best way to locate a walk is to find out where people want to go by first permitting them to form a path and take that as the location. This does not mean, however, that walks must always be in straight lines. Often a gentle curve can be introduced so as not to be objectionable from the standpoint of distance and to give a pleasing landscape effect. In such instances it may be desirable to plant a tree or clump of shrubs on the inside of the curve to give an apparent reason for the deviation. THE PLANTING OF TREES. PAs one of the larger features of the landscape, the location and num - of trees are of special importance. In selecting kinds the size of tree maturity should be considered. The white elm, for example, may attain a spread of 100 feet, while the green ash or the white birch will scarcely exceed one-fourth of that. Do not overplant the lawn. By filling up the front yard the landscape effect is not only destroyed but the buildings are obscured or entirely hidden. From the sanitary point of view this is also undesirable, for 'it encourages dampness. Keep the trees back far enough to permit a free circulation of air and plenty of sunshine. Overshading is bad for a building, and under these conditions the shingles decay quickly. As a protection against the afternoon sun, a shade tree or two to the southwest of the house is desirable. In general, plant along the sides to border or frame in the picture. in this way a vista is formed with the house as the central feature. Most people err in getting things into the wrong location rather than in the selection of varieties to plant. Keep an open front. Immediately in front of the house there is nothing so appropriate as a well-kept stretch of greensward. Keep the tree planting mostly along the sides, and in placing them avoid a stiff, mechanical arrangement. If an evergreen is located so many feet from the walk on one side, do not place another one at a corresponding distance on the other side. Avoid a stiff checker - board plan, and plant the trees more in clumps, securing the effect of a curve rather than a straight line, so that the whole will be as natural as possible. A limited number of tall trees to the rear of the house is useful </seg>

StMlKTV for a background and the pictorial effect thus secured is a vast improve - ment over that of the building which stands out against the bare skyline. LOCATING SHRUBBERY. EOne of the most common mistakes in planting shrubbery is to scatter •out over the lawn in a salt-and-pepper fashion. The way to secure tisfactory effect is by grouping. Place shrubs in a mass about the er, particularly to screen off the back yard from the front, and in the corners about the porch or along the base of the building. Plant them about 2% feet apart, placing the taller kinds, such as the bush honey - suckle and lilac, in the back, with the lower kinds, such as bridal wreath. In front. The shrubs should be cultivated or mulched for the first year or two after planting, after which they become sufficiently established to shade the ground and take care of themselves. If flowers are grown primarily for cut flowers, line out in a straight row in the garden where they can be cultivated conveniently. For orna - mental beds, place them in a border 2% or 3 feet in width along the front of the shrubbery. Here the shrubbery serves as a background against which the colors stand out much better than they will in the open. More - over, this location avoids cutting the lawn with beds which make unsightly holes during the winter. TRIMMING TREES The climate of our state is more or less severe upon tree life of all kinds. Trees are frequently injured by the splitting down of the branches due to sleet storms and severe winds. This condition requires pruning to insure the proper healing over of the wound, otherwise decay enters in and the lifeof the tree may be seriously shortened. In removing injured branches, particular pains should be taken to make the cut up close to the remaining branch and parallel to it. Under these conditions the wound is nourished and gradually heals over. Healing does not take place where a stub is left, and decay gradually works down into the main st«m. For cuts over 2 inches in diameter the surface should be coated with thick white lead. In this connection the practice of topping back large trees, such as soft maple, shonld be discouraged. This can in no manner change a soft - wooded tree to a hard-wooded kind, and in the majority of instances the central portion of the large stub dies back and decays, leaving only a shell of live bark around the circumference, and in a few years the tree goes to pieces and is ready for the brush-pile. It must also be remem - bered that the leaf system takes part in the work of digestion and that a large tree entirely defoliated in this fashion has been treated In a very severe manner. </seg>
            <seg id="p175">ADORNING THE FARMSTEAD. 175 LAWN MAKING. The first requisite in securing a good lawn is a rich black loam. It frequently happens that in excavating for the basement the clay soil is disposed of by spreading it over the front yard, thus leaving a very unsatisfactory soil for the lawn. Where this is done the top soil should first be taken off to a depth of 5 or 6 inches and replaced after the clay has been deposited. Similarly in back-filling around the foundation, debris of all kinds is dumped in. This is apt to cause trouble later in settling and also makes a very unsatisfactory soil with which to establish either grass or shrubs. Grade the lawn first and then thoroughly pulverize the soil for seed - ing. In Iowa the best time to seed is early in the spring, though in many seasons a very good stand can be secured by sowing the seed about the middle of August or just preceding the fall rains. Fall seeding, however, is more or less uncertain on account of the lack of moisture supply. In the case of fall seeding, it Is advisable to mulch the lawn the first winter with strawy manure as soon as the ground is frozen hard enough to bear up a team. This should be raked off in the spring when the growth begins. The best turf is that formed by Kentucky bluegrass. The Canada bluegrass is sometimes used, but this is not as good. Sow the seed rather thickly, say at the rate of four bushels per acre. Exercise care to get an even distribution of the seed in sowing, and it is often advis - able to re-seed at right angles to the first sowing in order to secure this. For the purpose of securing immediate effect the plan is often fol - lowed of mixing with the bluegrass the English or Italian ryegrass. This greens up at once and makes a very good temporary turf. Since it is only temporary in character, it gradually dies out, leaving the bluegrass in possession. In using the English ryegrass the proportion commonly followed is that of three bushels of bluegrass to one bushel of ryegrass. A slight sprinkle of white clover is sometimes added as a temporary turf. Many follow the practice of sowing oats or rye with bluegrass. This, in our opinion, is not advisable. Both of these plants make a coarse stubble unsuited for the lawn, and they are gross feeders. Instead of being a rrse crop they rob the grass of its moisture and food supply and shade too much. MOWING THE LAWN. Begin mowing just as soon as the grass is tall enough, as this cutting causes the plant to bunch and stool-out, thus securing a thicker turf. Set the lawn mower high, however; in fact, close cutting is not advisable in any case. Stop the mowing in time in the autumn to let the grass make a good top growth for winter protection. On the newly established lawn there is apt to be trouble with weeds of many kinds. Most of the coarser weeds will not stand close cutting and are killed out the first year by the use of the lawn mower. There are a few, however, Including the dandelion, which are not affected in this </seg>
            <seg id="p176">176 NEBRASKA 8TATE HuKThTI.TI UAL SOCIETY way. For the eradication of these, iron sulfate has been recommended, but its value for this purpose seems quite doubtful. In applying manure to the lawn take care to secure material as free as possible from weed seed. Nitrate of soda is often preferable for fer - tilizing because it is free from impurities. Use this at the rate of 200 pounds per acre, and apply it at the beginning of the growing season. Rolling is a good practice for the lawn, as it closes the cracks early in the spring and also shoves the crowns of the plant back into place, thus correcting the heaving which has taken place during late winter. THE PRUNING OF BUSH FRUITS. After winter is over and before growth starts in the spring the black raspberry patch needs a lot of pruning. Each living bush is at that time of year composed of from one to five old, dead canes that bore the preceding season, and one to five live ones that were shoots the preceding season. These young canes have long trailing laterals. The first thing to be done is to arm one's self with a pair of pruning shears and prune these laterals to from 8 to 14 inches in length, varying with the vigor of the cane and the number of canes in the bush. When the laterals are all pruned, the old dead canes should be removed with a pruning hook. At the same time enough young canes should be removed so that no bush has more than four or five canes to it. When setting the black raspberry the portion of the old cane adhering to the set should be pruned off as close to the crown of the set as possible. This is one of our best methods of controlling such fungous diseases as the cane blight, and is a good preventive in all cases. The pruning of the blackberry is very similar to that which I have outlined for the raspberry. The shoots should be nipped low — when not over 18 inches tall — if no supports are used for the bushes, and should not be nipped at all if supports are used. The laterals should not be pruned as short as the black raspberry laterals by from 4 to 8 inches. If no summer nipping is practiced the canes should be headed in about one-third of their length in the spring. Pie shoots of the ordinary red raspberry should not be nipped, but if dealing with the drooping purple cane varieties, such as the Shaffer ? Columbian, the nipping should be done the same as with the black caps. The young canes of the red raspberry should be pruned back to from 2y, to 3H feet before growth starts in the spring. At the same time the old dead canes and all weak young ones should be removed. The pruning of the currant and the gooseberry is probably more neg - lected than the pruning of any other fruit-bearing plant under cultivation. This is largely due to the fact that they will bear some fruit — of a poor quality, however — if they are not pruned at all. If one wishes to have the gooseberries and currants of good quality he must prune them sys - tematically each year. Pruning currants and gooseberries to the tree </seg>
            <seg id="p177">PRUNING GRAPES. 177 should be fostered from the first. No summer pruning is required by the currant and gooseberry, so all the season's pruning can be done in spring before the growth starts. Both the currant and the gooseberry produce their finest fruit on the young wood, but the one-year-old canes are never as productive as the two- and three-year-old canes. Host of the fruit is produced on the base of one-year-old laterals, or else on fruit spurs. Since the fruiting habits of the currant and gooseberry are so near alike, the system of pruning the two is the same. The pruning of currants and gooseberries consists of five operations: First, remove all wood of four years or over. Second, remove all one - year-old canes but two or three. Third, heading in of the remaining one-year-old canes. These should be pruned not over 18 inches in height This causes them to produce the fruit-bearing wood near the plant, and thus the canes are not so top-heavy when fruiting, and it also favors the production of fruit spurs. Fourth, heading in young laterals on two- and three-year-old canes. This should not be done unless they are making a vigorous growth — a growth of 8 or 10 inches should be headed back 2 or 3 inches. Fifth, heading in all drooping branches in such manner as to produce an upright growth. When setting any of the bush fruits the top should, of course, be pruned to correspond to the root-pruning the plant receives In trans - planting. — A. T. Keithley, in Fruitman and Gardener. PRUNING GRAPES. C. G. Marshall. The pruning of grapes is probably neglected more than any other fruit commonly grown on the Nebraska farms. The grape is a fruit that is easily grown in a large part of the state and is found in almost every fruit garden. It is grown readily on a variety of soils, is a late bloomer, almost always escaping late frosts, and a prolific bearer when properly Fig. 1. — Permanent stem and arms.

The grape bears its fruit on shoots put forth in the spring, which usually arise from canes of the previous year's growth, in which respect it differs from our common tree fruits. Old wood is therefore of little value on the grape, and pruning should be practiced to keep the old wood cut out and to regulate the new growth for the best possible production. Fig. 2. — Fruiting and renewal canes of third year. Harked ones to be cut. There are many systems of pruning, each having its points of advantage, but almost all arriving at the same final results. One feature common to almost all systems is the single permanent trunk from the top of which the bearing canes are renewed each year. Each variety does not require the same pruning, the difference, however, being mainly in the severity Pig. 3.— Vine in Fig. 2 after prun - ing, beginning of fourth year. Ithe operation. Strong growing and heavy bearing kinds should have bearing wood reduced more than the less vigorous and light bearers. To grow the ideal vine, training and pruning should be practiced from the time the plant is set Old and neglected vines, however, if vigorous, can often be shaped up fairly well and be made to produce surprisingly. </seg>
            <seg id="p179">RECEIVING. PLANTING AND PRUNING. 179 To get a system in mind let us take a vine at the time of planting and discuss its training for the first three years. The first year one cane is allowed to grow from the permanent trunk. This is cut off at about 18 inches or 2 feet from the ground, or at the height of the lower wire of the trellis. The second year two canes only are allowed to grow from the top buds of this trunk. These canes are cut back to 2 to 4 feet, depending on variety and space, and placed on the lower wire of the trellis, one extending either way from the trunk. The third year from six to twelve shoots will come from these two canes, which should be fastened in a vertical position to the higher trellis wires, cutting them off even with the top wire. This constitutes the framework of the vine and thereafter the opera - tion consists of taking out the old canes annually and allowing the new shoots to take their places. Excepting the permanent trunk and the two horizontal arms the vine is renewed every other year. Each alternate upright cane should annually be cut down to a short spur near the arm and the other cut off even with the top wire of the trellis. One bud from this spur should be allowed to grow the following year. The above suggestions can not always be carried out essentially as given, because the grower must be governed to a certain extent by the variety, the form of trellis used, the space to be occupied by each vine and other local conditions. The ideal vine should be kept in mind, how - ever, and the pruning should be done to make the vines conform as nearly as is practical. The illustrations used in this article were copied from Farmers' Bulletin No. 156, United States Department of Agriculture. Fig. 4.— Vine with fruit, fall of fourth year. RECEIVING, PLANTING AND PRUNING. C. G. Marshall. Practically all of the trees and plants now being planted by Nebraska growers are delivered in the spring — during the month of April. Nurser - ies deliver trees in several different ways, probably the most common being the shipment of all goods for a certain point by freight, consigned to an agent who receives and delivers them to the purchasers who have </seg>
            <seg id="p180">NEBRASKA 8TATE HORTHTI.TIKAL ■OCIITT 180 all been notified by mail to call at a certain livery barn or other suit - able place on a certain date. Nebraska nurseries now pack trees and plants in paper lined cases, each order tied separately and protected about the roots with moss and burlap, or each individual order packed separately and completely covered with burlap, hay, or straw and wet moss about the roots. Goods as a rule arrive at the delivery point in good condition, and losses due to exposure after the trees are taken up at the nursery and before being replanted can more often be charged to the purchaser than to the nursery. "HEELING IN." It is important that trees be called for on the day set for delivery, as the agent has another point of delivery the next day and can not stay and see that they are kept moist. When left in the hands of the Hrery men or other disinterested parties they are sometimes allowed to become dry, and sometimes very quickly, owing to the dry and windy weather. As soon as taken home the packing should be removed and the trees "heeled in" where the earth is moist and a protection is af - forded against the drying winds. The bundle should be opened and the trees and plants spread out so that moist earth will come in contact with all the roots. They may be left in this condition until the ground for planting has been prepared, but should be planted out as soon as possible after growth starts. PLANTING. EThe site for planting should be well drained and the soil quite rich, lications of manure should not be made near the time of planting, ipt it be thoroughly rotted. Coarse manure when mixed with the soil allows it to dry out quickly. The ground should be plowed deep and thoroughly firmed down with a disc or subsurface packer so that it is fine and firm, and will not dry out readily. Success, then, is largely a matter of avoiding all unnecessary root-exposure and thorough firming of the soil about the roots. Soaking the roots in water for a few hours before planting sometimes helps very materially toward securing sure growth. If they are to be exposed for any length of time, puddling is also often desirable. Holes should be dug large enough to admit the roots in their natural position and deep enough so that the trees will set about three inches deeper than they were in the nursery. The ends of the roots should be trimmed back to solid live wood and the heaviest roots placed on the side toward the prevailing winds. The tops should lean toward the southwest. Fine, moist soil should be placed about the roots and packed firmly with the feet, care being exercised not to bark them. If the trees are watered it should be done thoroughly, adding the water before the </seg>
            <seg id="p181">ORCHARD HEATING. 181 replacing the balance of the soil. If the ground is extremely dry It would be advisable to fill the holes with water a few hours before plant - ing, allowing it to soak away before the trees are set. FORMING THE HEADS AND PRUNING. rrhe young trees should be well formed, straight and clean, of good for the age, and of good shape for the variety. Allowance must be made, however, for the variety. Varieties like the Northwest Greening and Ben Davis make larger and more symmetrical trees at the same age than Duchess, Genet, and some others. The variety habit of the tree should be kept in mind, judging its quality. Slender and crooked trunks and stunted or unhealthy trees should never be planted. Two or three - year-old stock is best for planting. The mistake of setting large trees — three, four, or five years old — is often made. Such trees suffer more from transplanting and the heads already formed are as a rule not desirable. Fially more than half of the original root system is left In the nur - w when trees are dug, and the tops must be pruned back to corre - or the tree will not be balanced. In order to save the life of the tree, if the spring is at all dry, this pruning must be done, as a small part of the original root system cannot supply the whole top with mois - ture and plant food. The pruning back of the top should be as severe, if not more so, than the root pruning in digging, since the roots must be - come adjusted to their new quarters before their activities begin, while the tops experience no great difference in this respect. Pruning to shape the head as desired is important at this time. The mistake of starting the head with too many limbs is very common. For most varieties not more than five limbs, well distributed, are sufficient. A whorl of limbs on a small tree may not appear objectionable at this time, but when those limbs have grown to six inches or more in diameter the mistake is apparent. The tree should be headed low and the limbs should be well distributed, no two coming -out opposite or nearly opposite each other. ORCHARD HEATING. C. Q. Marshall. Many commercial orchardists in all parts of the country are asking if it really pays to equip orchards with artificial heating devices. Al - most every Nebraska grower would say that it did not pay to heat last spring (1911). The writer is Interested in an eastern Nebraska orchard that is equipped with modern oil burning orchard heaters which were in operation a part of one night last spring. Until picking time we were of the s opinion that no good came from it, as trees outside the heated area In E orchard set fruit and almost every apple tree in eastern Nebraska put out blossoms set and matured fruit. At harvest time, however, effects of the artificial heat were certainly apparent in this orchard. </seg>
            <seg id="p182">182 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY There was but one period after the blossoms opened when the tem - perature reachd freezing. By 12 o'c'lock the night of May 1 the tempera - ture had dropped to 30 degrees with a slight wind from a little to the north of west. We started the fires in the heaters, beginning at the northeast corner of the orchard and following the north line of pots to the west side of the orchard and then down the outside row on the west side and then every other row was lighted north and south, working east from the west side. The reservoir type of heaters was used and in the rush the first ones lighted on the north and west side were not carefully regulated and on returning to this part of the orchard some time later it was found that the valves had been closed to such an extent in most cases that the fires had gone out. Frost was forming on the vegetation near the ground and even on the lids of the fire pots where the fires had died out. The thermometers showed a temperature of about 27 degrees and the ground was slightly frozen in places. Farther east where the fires burned steadily no frost was apparent, even though this part of the orchard was considerably lower and the movement of air less. Aa the fruit began to gain size and color it could be noticed that the trees bordering on the north and west sides of the orchard were carrying a lighter crop of fruit, and when the fruit was gathered the light yield corresponded very closely to the area where the fires went out and frost formed. There was not another orchard in Cass county, or anywhere in eastern Nebraska coming under our notice where the crops were so even as in this orchard. Almost every tree in this orchard, except those on the north and west sides, carried a full crop, and it was evenly distrib - uted all through the trees. In other orchards similarly located and Elly well treated, otherwise than the heating, the crop was more or spotted and uneven. Quite often the crop was mainly on one side e tree or on certain parts of the orchard. THE FARMER'S GARDEN How different are the gardens today from the old home gardens of thirty and forty years ago, with its little beds that were spaded and thrown up so neatly and bordered by hyacinths, jonquils, tulips, May E sweet Williams, and pansies.

Where the soil is favorable and climatic conditions are the same and an ideal lawn grass is desired, plant Kentucky blue grass, using as a nurse crop white clover at the rate of 5 per cent in weight to the blue Under the immediate neighborhood of large trees where the lawn is heavily shaded, a mixture consisting of equal parts of Kentucky blue grass, wood meadow, and one-fourth of various leaved fescue and crested dogs' tail is fine. Where an immdeiate effect is desired and growing conditions are not perfect a mixture of the following grasses is preferable: Kentucky blue grass 40 per cent, Canada blue grass 20 per cent, perennial rye grass 20 per cent, creeping bent grass 10 per cent, and sheep fescue 10 per cent. Seed should be sown liberally, about one quart to 300 square feet should be the minimum quantity required for a new lawn. One-half this quan - tity if reseeding an old one. If an immediate effect is desired used one - third more seed. Do not buy cheap seed. Try to get seed that will weigh about eighteen or twenty pounds per bushel. PLANT-BREEDING FARM. Max Pfaender, Mitchell, Neb. f[ am a horticulturist out of pure love for this line of work, and as I wish to offer a suggestion which came to my mind while perusing pages of the annual report of our State Horticultural Society for Why can not we have a horticultural plant-breeding farm? — a plant - breeding farm with the object in view of creating and producing new va - rieties of the various fruits, ornamental trees, shrubs and flowers — vari - eties that are actual hojne products, produced in part from our own na - tive kinds, partly from our sorts now under cultivation and partly from beat varieties obtainable from other states and countries. Let this plant-breeding farm be modeled partly after that started by the efforts of the Minnesota State Horticultural Society. It should be in charge of a good practical superintendent who has a wide knowledge of the practice and theory of plant breeding. The farm should be under the general supervision of a board consisting of four or five members, one or more to be elected by the Nebraska State Horticultural Society, one to be a member of the Board of Regents of the University of Ne - braska, and the professor of horticulture at the Experiment Station, ex - offlcio — or some such similar board — the main consideration being to secure a board which would have at heart the horticultural advancement </seg>
            <seg id="p186">186 The stale should make an extra appropriation for this plant-breeding (arm because it would be a business proposition. The people of our state would be the ones benefited by it. After ten or fifteen years the state could boast of an ideal apple for each one. of our horticultural dis - tricts, an ideal plum, grape, etc. At the Minnesota plant-breeding farm already great results are in evidence, and our problems here in Nebraska are even greater than those in Minnesota because our range is wider, our material more abundant, and our results will be even of greater value. tTbe work in general as such a horticultural plant-breeding farm Id be the getting together of every variety suitable for breeding t, and then using these in hand crossing work according to the re - i to be produced. First of all, I would place our native fruits and flowers. Out here in Scotubluff county, where I believe climatic conditions are about the worst in the state, we have growing wild a red, yellow, and a black cur - rant, plums, grapes, gooseberries, sand cherries, buffalo berries, and choke cherries, and the farther east we go the greater is the number of wild fruits found native. The wild varieties should be used for mother stock so as to insure hardiness and vigor in the resultant cross. These could be crossed with the best varieties under cultivation. For apples we could use the Hiber - nal, Duchess, and Malinda or other very hardy species of the mother stock, crossing them with the varieties under cultivation of best quality and with belt bearing, shipping, and keeping characteristics. There is no end of desirable work that could be done along these lines. This is all practical work, and would be of great practical value to our state. Not only could we produce strictly hardy and all-around desirable varieties for the western part of the state, but we could even improve over our varieties generally planted in the favorable southeast - ern part of the state. Would it not be worth while to produce a variety of apple as good as the Grimes' Golden, as hardy and prolific as the Duchess, as good keeper as the Ben Davis, combined with other desirable features? For western Nebraska we want an all-around good strawberry, raspberry, grape and plum — in fact every kind of fruit. Likewise every fruit tree, shrub, and flower of the entire state can be improved on. Good old Father Harrison (young in spirits, however) has done not - able work in improving the peony, phlox, and other perennials. He saw the chance and need of improvement and has given a lot of his time and money for this improvement work. If we only had a hundred more men like him. In Minnesota we all hear of Peter M. Gideon who originated the Wealthy apple at great personal sacrifices. Other similar instances could be cited, but as a whole such men are scarce and their means will often not permit them to do their favorite work, even though their hearts arc willing.

Then I am confident that we shall see some great and very beneficial results from it. In closing I wish to state that sooner or later our state will do just what I have her* suggested. We need this plant-breeding farm, and I dare say that our State Horticultural Society will be instrumental in bringing this about. Let us start at once our propaganda, let us enlist the aid and good will of every citizen, and farmers especially, in this movement, and as soon as there is popular demand for it, we shall see our plant-breeding farm in reality. PLANT BREEDING FOR NEBRASKA. Max Pfaender, Mitchell, Nebr. L Plant breeding is very interesting and fascinating work for the horti - urist. As a rule we think that hybridizing or crossing and the grow - ing, selection, and propagation of new varieties is only to be performed by professors and government scientists. Not so, however. Every horti - culturist who will interest himself in plant breeding can do this work if a little practice is had and the few fundamental principles are under - stood. » First I shall give very briefly just one important part of the theory plant breeding. Here we have, for instance, two varieties or species of a fruit or vegetable, the one is hardy, vigorous, and prolific, but the fruit or vegetable born by it is poor of quality and small. The other one is rather tender and a shy bearer, but the fruit or vegetable is of very good quality. Now we would naturally prefer to have a plant that would combine in itself the good qualities of both and lack their poor characteristics. In order to produce such a plant we would cross or hybridize the one with the other and from the resulting seeds grow as many seedlings as possible. Of these seedlings the strongest and most promising are kept and the rest discarded. When the plants bear the final test is made, the best fruited ones are kept and propagated, either by cuttings, layers, or grafting. For beginners this is really all of the theory that we need to know and in short can be stated as follows: To improve plants we cross a plant having certain desirable characteristics with another plant of the same or a similar species having other desirable characteristics, thereby aiming to unite into one plant the good qualities of both parents. Before discussing the practice of a plant breeding we must first get a rudimentary knowledge of the flowers and sexual organs of plants. I shall try to confine myself to some of the more common fruits because these have large flowers and are not complicated. As a rule we will find both male and female organs present In the same flower. The pistil with the stigma at its end is the female organ, and is always found in the center of the flower. Sometimes there are </seg>
            <seg id="p188">188 one, three, five, or many. Around these pistils is either one, two, or many circles of stamens, the male organs. On the end of the stamen we have the anther or pollen bag. This contains the pollen grains, which are the male fertilizing element. Some of the flowers of fruits are shown in figure 1. Fig. 1. Showing some common fruit flowers in cross-section. kin order to produce seed or fruit the pollen grains must fall onto the ;y stigma, and there it must stay and grow down to fertilize the a of the seed. Now as to hand crossing. The first thing to do is to prevent the flower to be crossed from being fertilized by its own pollen, or else we would get a self-fertilized seed, and so crossing would not have any effect on the results. To accomplish this the flower bud is emasculated a day or two before it would naturally open, this simply means to re - move the stamens from the flowerbud, special care being taken not to break open the anthers lest some pollen falls onto the stigma. Often to </seg>
            <seg id="p189">189 the flower, but in all these operations the flower should be cut and hurt as little as possible. This operation of emasculation can be performed by means of little tweezers or fine pointed scissors, and with some flower* I have used a sharp small stick like a tooth-pick and my thumb nails. After emasculation the flowers should be covered over with a small paper bag to prevent any foreign pollen from getting on to the stigma. Figure 2 shows a strawberry bud before and after emasculation. Figure 3 shows the flowers with the bag tied over. Fig. 2. Strawberry bud before and after emasculation; A, before emascu - lation; B, after emasculation, showing the head of pistils (the stamens and petals have been removed. The next day or sometimes longer the stigma will start to become sticky, just as though it were exuding a bit of honey, and then is the best time to apply the pollen from the flower which is to be crossed onto the first flower. If the two plants blossom at the same time, then it is best to pick several well-opened flowers and see whether the anthers are open and are shedding pollen when shaken on the thumb nail. If pollen </seg>

If the plants blossom at differ - ent time the pollen may be kept in small glass bottles for a few days and sometimes It is also advisable to try and retard the period of blos - soming by various methods, such as mulching in the case of strawberries and heeling In and keeping the plants frozen later than otherwise by a heavy mulch, but the tops must be covered entirely. This latter method is used for retarding the bush fruits and sometimes even trees. After the pollen has been applied and you are sure that some of the pollen has adhered to the moist stigma, then the bag should again be placed over the flower and a label attached giving names of parents and date of crossing When the fruit or seed is ripe the seeds should be washed out and either planted at once or stratified until the following spring. I Strawberries and the bush fruits are best planted at once in fla rich sandy soil and kept in the hot bed or greenhouse until well u len the third leaf is developed they should be transplanted into pape s or flats, and in August or September they can be set outside in mes so that winter protection can be given. Sometimes, if the plan not big enough to set outside, they must be over-wintered in the ce or a greenhouse. The grapes, apples, cherries, and plums are be itified until the folowing spring or until fall when they are plante&lt; th these last-named fruits the practice is often to graft them to old cks so as to get fruit sooner. This grafting can be done the first ond year. tThe plant breeder should try to get as many of the native wild fruits plants as possible and plant them near the named varieties. These all valuable for crossing purposes, especially if we wish to produce y and vigorous kinds. The various named varieties can often be Pig. 3.

            <seg id="p191">191 In the foregoing remarks I confined myself largely to fruits, but the principles are the same for all plants. Great and interesting results can be produced with vegetables, flowers, shrubs, and trees. And often the breeding of annuals is practiced to a greater extent because results are evident within one year as a rule. I The potato is a good plant to work on, and especially do we need a e disease-resisting variety. The structure of the potato flower is r similar to the fruit flowers described above, at least in general as one stigma in the center and five large stamens. Emasculate the ers just as described for fruit flowers and wait until the stigma be - es moist and sticky. Then cross with the desired variety. Also use paper bag and mark the flowers crossed. In fall the seed balls shoulc gathered and the seed washed out and kept in a dry cool place untl y spring. It is then sown in a hot bed or flats kept in a warm n. After the plants are two or three weeks old the little seedlings. transplanted into paper pots or flats and then set out into the field it the beginning of June, setting the plants the usual distance apart If we are breeding for disease resistance then the plants should not be sprayed, but to make the test severe let those die which can not with - stand the ravages of disease, and then those few that do remain wil surely be resistant varieties. In fall when dug the hill with the best looking and largest number of medium sized tubers should be saved and propagated. This 1b the manner in which all new varieties have been originated. ■For crossing purposes the wild forms of the potato are used to good intage, and these can be secured from some of the seed houses or i the government bureau of plant introduction.

Only within the past one hundred years has he begun to wake to his folly in this regard. It's high time we were waking. Henceforth we must feel something more than a mere sentimental regard for trees — we must cherish and foster them as the very guardians of the flame of human life. For they are just that.

IMPORTANCE OF ORCHARD CULTIVATION IN SUMMER. By E. F. Stephens, Nampa, Idaho. (Traveling through the country I noticed that some orchards planted b spring, as well as some of the older orchards, have not yet been tivated. People say to themselves and to others, "The spring has ■n unusually favorable, we have had more than the average amount snowfall the past winter, we have had frequent spring rains." Under :h conditions many a man feels that he can busily engage in other m of work and that his orchard is not yet suffering from lack of cul - ition. The planter who reasons in this way evidently forgets frequent show - ers or periods of drizzling rainfalls really require an Increased amount of cultivation. Scientific men with ample time for study have demon - strated that where the rainfall is not more than one-fifth of an inch no addition is made to the amount of soil water stored; succeeding evap - oration quickly removes the light rainfall. The late Professor King of Wisconsin has demonstrated that an appli - cation of one pailful of water applied on the surface around a petted tree or plant each evening, for thirty consecutive days, will leave the sub- </seg>
            <seg id="p194">194 NKUKASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL 8OCIKTY ■oil under that tree or plant dryer than a contiguous yard of subsoil that has not received any water from any source. HOW DOES PROFESSOR KING EXPLAIN THIS? Artificial application of water to the surface, or a shower, or a raiu, promptly develops a rapid evaporation from the surface. This sets in motion the law of transposition of soil moisture stored in the subsoil. The capillary circulation causes the moisture stored in the subsoil to rise to the surface, to take the place of that lost by evaporation. Under these conditions the stored moisture in the subsoil is lost by transpira- A light rainfall may not, usually does not, wet down more than an inch or two. and this is speedily lost by subsequent rapid evaporation. Only the heavy periods of rainfall deposit water enough in the soil to reach down to and reinforce the supply of water already stored in the subsoil. Hence the skilful orchardist or gardener must start his culti - vator after each and every rainfall that crusts the surface. Tnis rainy spring has compelled me to cultivate some of our orchards nine times and we are now starting over all of our three hundred and eighty-five acres of home orchards the seventh time, this within a period of forty - eight days, cultivation having commenced March 20. Those who have conserved the very ample supply of snow and rain water given us during the month of January, February, and March now have a sufficient store of soil water to, with suitable tillage, carry their orchards forward a uumber of months, depending very much upon the character of the soil, the depth that water has been stored in the sub - soil and the character of the past and succeeding tillage. tWe have orchard lands that would be classed as high and dry lands Ich have not been watered in a period of twenty months, but the ige has been such as to maintain three feet of soil moisture. This isture could not be reinforced from below because, between the sur - e moisture conserved by cultivation and the lower underlying water le, there is a stratum of hardpan about twelve inches in depth. The I auger shows three feet of conserved snow and spring rain, one foot hardpan; under the hardpan three feet of soil gradually gaining in isture down to soil water. tThis particular orchard, now entering upon its fifth season's growth, is, the trees have been planted four years and five weeks, is now ing into bloom. The question of what can be done by frequent tillage is to some ex - tent governed by the texture of the soil. Where the soil is pliable, easily worked, carrying such percentage of silt or sand as will enable the culti - vator to keep it in a mellow condition it seems possible to conserve the moisture from month to month and from year to year. We note, how - ever, where spots of gumbo intervene that it is difficult to maintain such orVrUm" 1^ to^r" "" ""^ '^^ mOi " tUre f * Om l ° m ° Dth </seg>

This is dete&lt;ted by the character of the water in shallow surfaee wellb. In our own orchards the walls first dug before irrigation began de - veloped soft, good water at thirty feet With the advent of irrigation the water of the wells was made brackish, and we were compelled to go down seventy-five to one hundred feet, then finding pure, soft water, under a clay stratum of such thickness and quality as serves to inter - cept the alkali and surface waters and give us pure, soft, mountain water. tWe note in traveling through the Country alkali rising in many ?s. Uncultivated roadsides will show alkali, while properly tilled :ent fields or orchards will be completely free from alkali. Why is this? Suitable tillage and frequent cultivation very greatly reduce the loss of soil water. In other words, sixteen to twenty cultivations during the season very nearly prevent the loss of moisture by surface; there will be little subsoil water rising. If water does not rise from the sub - soil to replace that lost by evaporation, very little alkali will be brought to the surface; hence superior and frequent tillage is one of the very best methods of keeping down alkali. HORTICULTURAL SUGGESTIONS. J. A. Yager, Fremont. To thousands of people, especially the dwellers in cities and villages, the high cost of living is one of the absorbing topics; and it touches not only the laboring man so-railed, but the mechanic, clerk, professional man, and all others save the person of affluence and large income. It is a burning question, and all manner of reasons are assigned as the cause. One will charge It to the high tariff, another to the powerful combina - tions known as the trusts, too much gold being produced, too many auto - mobiles, the concentration of the population in the cities, too many mid - dle men between producer and consumer. J. J. Hill has been telling the people, that if immediate remedial measures are not taken, we may look for calamitous results. We may well agree with him, that the source of all wealth is the soil, and that commercial pursuits of cities have absorbed the dweller upon 1 the soil, until the equilibrium between production and consumption has been seri - ously disturbed. National commissions have been appointed to investigate the whole problem, and the concensus of opinion is that more people should go back to the soil and become producers of the necessities of life. It is a grand provision in the economy of nature, that our tastes for employment dif - fer. The production of grain and live stock easily take first place in im - portance in this state. </seg>

It is true that commercial orcharding has not been developed very extensively, but the day is fast approaching when a large number of such enterprises for profit will be found in the eastern third of this state. Aside from the commercial orcharding, the farmer has his orchard and fruit garden for home use, even the city dweller may have fruit with a small initial investment. Who will venture to estimate the value, for home use alone of the fruit crop of 1911? Of course we often find a man who sees more beauty in a Jersey Red hog, than a Jonathan apple, but we need both the hog and the apple. I Out of the dim mists of the past rises the Garden of Eden, at the wn of our race, and from that time to the present progress has been marked by horticultural achievements, the tendency constantly being toward higher and nobler impulses and grander moral and mental devel - opment. The alarmists and magazine writers are calling our attention to the fact that the American people are living at a killing pace, and that there is great need for diversion, something to cause a man to for - get the daily grind and create a breathing place. I have a professional friend who tired of horseback riding for recreation; he said golf was a positive waste of time; of reading he did too much; dabbling in poli - tics bored him; an "auto" was beyond his means. He appealed to me to make suggestions as to how to spend his leisure moments. I suggest - ed a flower garden. This was four years ago. He scarcely knew a dahlia from a phlox, but he bought some books, a boe, and some other hand tools, some seeds and bulbs and plants, and today on his lot, 140 by 140 feet, he has by far the finest flower garden in the city. He has become an enthusiast, has better health. The neighbors are doing like - wise, and a short time ago he said he could sell $250 worth of surplus plants each year if he were eo disposed. A short time ago I asked a banker how business was coming along. With the faintest suggestion of a sigh and a half-hearted smile he said, "Business is first rate, deposits large, interest rates are going up, but do you see that pile of mail? I work till 10 o'clock to keep up with my business, and it is simply killing. I wish I could just do some common work. I would like to saw wood or carry brick, or drive a dray or some - thing." Now that man's physician should prescribe that our banker join the nature club, plant a flower bed, raise some small fruit, pick strawberries and mow his own lawn. That is the remedy for tired business men. Bach recurring springtime, when the frosts and snows have melted •way, and the sun begins to warm the earth, a veritable miracle is per - formed. No one can explain it, even the scientist does not tell how it occurs. It is the growth of plant life, a very common phenomenon but clouded in deep mystery.

There were three plants closely interwoven — a phlox, rudbekia and a paeony. Upon lifting the clump it was found that the roots were closely and almost inseperably intertwined. Each plant had been de - riving the particular material from the same black soil that was needful in its cell structure; each plant performed its natural function, each grew and blossomed and produced its particular kind of foliage and flowers. But who will say how the rudbekia drew the golden color from the soil, how the phlox found its pure white blossoms, how the velvety rose of the paeony, and especially the fragrance of the two latter, were extract - ed from the few handfuls of clammy dirt? If you want to be a philoso - pher, a scientist, a man, of learning and a student, grow plants and trees and flowers. Fruit culture' admits of intensive methods. A small area will gir* immense returns both in pleasure and in profit. You don't have to have a big farm upon which to raise fruit and flowers. We hear of $600 net being made from an acre of strawberries, not in Texas or Maine, but in Nebraska. Average annual returns from apple orchards exceeding any ordinary farm crop. I have often marveled at our wastefulness. No richer soil can be found anywhere than here in Nebraska; and yet how much of It lies ab - solutely unused and unproductive. Take a drive through any of oar splendid cities or villages of which we are so proud, and observe how many vacant lots are abandoned to the growth of obnoxious weeds, tin cans, coal ashes, decrepit machinery. In fact, these lots become the hospital for the flotsam and jetsam and the cast-off debris of civilisa - tion. Imagine how many potatoes and cabbages, currants, gooseberries, raspberries, and other small fruits might be raised on these self-same lots. Some years ago the enterprising mayor of Detroit observed all this. He banded the boys and girls together, and you have all read of the marvelous results that were attained. In the vacation time parents are hard put to find something for th boys to do; but let me tell you how to solve this problem. Help the boys to clean up the vacant ground just back of the house. Help them to care for a vegetable and fruit garden; make a mental note of the bene - ficial results to the boys, and observe how it decreases table expense* and adds to your sum of human happiness. Yes, the boy may play foot ball if he will, but if he works some in the garden you will always On him on the winning side at the ball game.

For several years I have been taking special interest in watching the poor orphan boys and girls at the Lutheran Orphan's Home in Fre - mont.

Flower and vegetable seeds are furnished them, and under the direction of the superintendent the rivalry begins as to who can produce the best and the most from the seeds. You would need to see their little gardens to believe how much they can do with a little encouragement. It is my firm belief that some day in the future when the cry of high priced living becomes more insistent, men and women such as develop this kind of children, will point out the way by which we may still be amply fed, housed, and clothed. tThe day is not far distant when elemental horticulture and garden - will be taught in our public schools; we are far behind the European ntries in this respect.

These professional folks will stand in line waiting for a chance to get a foothold in life, but for all save a few the places will be filled, and in the language of the Bible, "many will be called but few chosen." Some day this will happen, but to all such the hand of trtunity is beckoning them back to the soil to engage in agricultural horticultural pursuits. Bit is often said that distance lends enchantment, and it often happens we do not fully realize the possibilities that lie all about us. To trate my point, I had two well-intentioned neighbors who had heard of the great profits in fruit growing in Colorado and Texas. The allure - ments of the promoters were irresistible. The neighbor who went to Texas looked for an ideal climate, no winter, no frost, no snow, plenty of rain, cool nights, no insects, good markets, agreeable neighbors, bounti - ful crops, and good prices. I was sorry when he left. The girls took the kodak along and were to send us pictures of the .scenery there; but the results were very disappointing all the way around. It didn't rain much, the sage brush was about the only vegetation, the strawberry plants all died, coyotes, jackrabbits, and Mexicans were their only neigh - bors, the girls were lonesome, the mother discouraged. They all came </seg>
            <seg id="p199">HORTICULTURAL 8UOGESTION8. 199 back to the fruitful fields of Nebraska. The neighbor who went to Colo - rado had a similar experience in many respects; he lost the fruit of five years' labor, and found that his own county was a better county for fruit than Colorado with all its allurements on paper. Planting an orchard is like depositing money in a savings bank, you get simple and compound interest. A man said to me this fall: "I have fifteen bushels of Grimes' Golden apples that cost me two cents per bushel." Asking how this could be he replied, "The tree cost me thirty cents and to all appearances it is good for ten more crops." A good investment I should say. A drainage ditch was being dug in Dodge county. The right-of-way required the purchase of three Wine - sap apple trees, twelve years old. The purchasing agent allowed $20 each, the original cost was twenty cents each, and the owner did not get too much. A farm for sale upon which a good orchard is located com - mands a higher price than the farm without an orchard. In advertising a house and lot for sale, the owner never fails to state that there are fine shade trees on the place, shrubs around the house, twenty bearing fruit trees, and all kinds of small fruit. Fuit growing has its vicissitudes; there are early and late frosts; are insects that bite and suck and sting; there are rodents' that roots; domestic animals will destroy trees; weeds are natural ene - mies; hail, drouth, and wind often play havoc. But what crop is there that is not subject to these besetments? The man who complains that fruit growing does uot pay in Nebraska, not even for home use, is the man who plants his trees in a hurry, never cultivates them, gives them no water during a drouth, has no time to prune, does not know a spraying machine when he sees it; in fact absolutely neglects the trees after planting them. This man says that it is cheaper to buy fruit, but about the only time the children have any apples to eat is at Christmas time or some special occasion. Ordinary care and Intelligence are as neces - sary in fruit growing as in any other line of endeavor. I think I cannot do better in closing than to recommend that each farmer in the state become a member of the State Horticultural Society. Ewant to do something of permanent value, plant some trees and and this may prove to be more enduring than most of your other lishments. E Professor Bessey of the State University is the Burbank of Nebraska, he has been telling us to allow the leaves to He on the lawn during winter as a mulch to the shrubs and trees. Bixby of the Lincoln aal has tried the plan and philosophizes as follows: What he remarked — I read it all, Nor did I doubt or scoff it; Said I: "When leaves fall in the fall My lawn sha'l get the profit."

I read the pleasant line you wrote And said, "Oh what a pity To bum the dry dead leaves that float Like airships through the city." Then came the playful wind that sweeps Down like a winter blixzard; It piled those leaves in shapeless heaps From A half-way to lizard. And now, old friend, it'g up to you — I fear you will upbraid him, But what's a fellow going to do When nature will not aid him? The leaves that fell like snowflakes rare.

RENEWING OLD ORCHARDS. t Among the greatest strides of education along scientific lines, but are greater than those along horticultural lines. Especially is this case in the treatment of plant diseases, both fungous and insect. These these alone have smitten the fruit industry of the Central West, and .as beea left for the eastern and the western man to work out the i especially the western man. and now that they have shown us ■ the work can be done, we are willing to fall in line and help the i work along. There Is a desire the country over to renew the fruit industry, espe - cially that of apples, and thousands of acres will be set this spring or tail, and at the very best the owners will have to wait twelve to fifteen years to get profitable crops from them. This is all right if the owner is willing and is in a condition to wait Yean ago there were times when there was a desire to set large </seg>
            <seg id="p201">RENKWINO OLD ORCHARDS. 201 orchards, and they were set. Some of them were taken care of and some were not, but few of them are in good condition and bearing paying crops at the present time. But with proper care they could be tght into bearing within one-fourth the time required to bring a g orchard into profitable bearing. Some of these old orchards have only a part of the trees standing, others have practically all of the original trees, some of which are sev - enty-five years old or older and yet they will bear profitable crops if properly taken care of. There is really more business in the man who goes out and makes the old orchard "blossom as the rose" than the man who goes out and sets the young orchard. The latter may stay with his job and make it a success, while the former is sure of success at the beginning, and now is when this nation needs apples; the future will be able to take care of itself. Eyou only knew what luscious fruit is locked up in those old, dead, diseased trees, you would jump at the chance to get it out &gt;. It is there, and you need not worry, for if you do your part the nd nature will do the rest. Never was this matter brought more forcibly to our minds than last spring, when, in making our annual pruning, we came to the old Milam trees, trees that had stood there for at least three-quarters of a century, and only one crop of apples in the past twenty years that was fit for anything. We naturally concluded that they were no good, and after some few arguments, decided to cut them down, as they were disease - breeders and were a means of infection for the younger trees. However, the work was delayed, and before we were ready to do the work, we had concluded to experiment with them, and experiment we did. E'he pruning was done carefully under my supervision, and very little ras left on them, at least some of them. However, we wanted a of apples the first year, as we were anxious to see the results, and was taken to leave some of the healthiest small limbs which had fruit on them, but we were very particular to get the tops out so we get them down low enough to work on them. „ r'e aimed to take out the dead wood, but did not in all cases; in some of our limbs bearing the most of. the healthy twigs were half way around, so we left them, and trust that the new growth will in a few years take their place. Even some of the bodies have quite a lot of dead wood in them. In fact in some cases we chiseled this wood out, that is, if it was decayed too much to be solid. We soon found that we were right in our guess, that these trees were veritable incubators of disease and insects. After the heavy pruning was over, I went over the trees personally with pruning shears and pruning knife and cut out small diseased branches which had been overlooked. In many places, too, the twigs were too thick; here I thinned out the desired amount. Just as the buds were swelling, but before they were open, we sprayed them with commercial lime-sulphur in the strength of 11 to 1. </seg>
            <seg id="p202">202 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY We sprayed the trees very thoroughly, forcing the spray mixture into the dead places under the bark and, in fact, everywhere that anything could hide. We should have scraped off all the old bark, but we were too busy, and let it go. As soon as the blossoms fell, we sprayed them thoroughly with the lime-sulphur spray, but diluted to 40 to 1 and about 2 to 2^ pounds of araenate of lead added; in fact, we used the same spray on these old - timers as we used on the younger orchards, and did the job just as thorough, possibly more so. We quit too soon, we will admit, yet we had not over 3 per cent of the late brood — we undoubtedly got them the first time — but we did have some curculio. This could have been prevented by spraying at the time the little leaflets started, with the dilute lime-sulphur and a little of the arsenate added. 1)\, is thought by many that the old-time varieties that one time did well have passed their date of usefulness, and that they are not pted to this country and climate any more, but our experiments here not bear out this theory at all, but on the contrary show that the varieties will do as well as ever if only given fair treatment. The residents were astonished at the size of the Milams we raised on se old stubs, and that the first year, after the renovating, and they are of fruit bnds, promising a good crop next year. What we have done for this old orchard on a small scale can be done in thousands of others on a small or large scale, and will return their owners a good profit before a young orchard would ever come into bearing. Apples are high now, so now is the time to grow them, for by the time the young orchard comes into bearing they may be so cheap or other obstacles present themselves, that there will not be the profit in them that there is today. Make your money today and spend it to make yourself and others happy, and at the same time set another young orchard to be coming on for your old age or for your children — or some one else's children. I There are some important points not to be overlooked in putting r life into an old orchard, for we know we are to redeem this orchard the use of the saw and the sprayer — mainly by the sprayer — after the t pruning is over. tWe should always do the best we can, so if we are unable to burn brush we should drag it out of the orchard, making things as neat and d as possible. In burning, however, we get rid of a lot of diseases. Old trees as a rule heal over very slowly, so it is advisable in all eases to have some paint and paint over the larger limbs that are sawed off; indeed it would pay to chisel out the dead wood and fill the cavities with cement if one were not in too big a hurry. I In pruning we must bear one point continually In mind, and that is get the tree as low headed as possible. If you want profit from the rt yon may have to leave the tree a little taller than you like, with ■ </seg>
            <seg id="p203">STATK FAIU FBI IT EXHIBITS. 203 view of cutting it down lower when the lower growth is sufficient to make the entire head, but always bear this part in mind when pruning — a thorough job of spraying is next to impossible in a tall tree. Beside* you will want to be up-to-date and thin your apples and raise great bit? ones to show your neighbor what you can do after he has been laughing at your efforts all summer long. • It may be that the old orchard needs a tonic in the way of some manure or commercial fertilizers. However, the chance is that all it needs is a good plowing, not too deep, and after cultivating awhile sown to some cover crop, such as cow peas or vetch. If the ground is too roll - ing, rye may be sown to keep it from washing through the winter. Your old trees may be so low in vitality that they will not bear the first sea - son; if not, they will undoubtedly set the fruit buds for the next season. It is advisable in some cases to cut off all the large limbs and start a new growth, either from a few little sprouts or from those that will spring up from the body the first season. Care also should be taken to scrape off all the old bark, I am sure, for here and in the dead spots are the spores and eggs for infection the following season. Of course the majority of them are subdued by the spray, but enough escape at the best. I think here is where we got our supply of curculio, under this old bark. If there is a blotch in these old trees, all of the infected twigs should be cut out, then there will have to be a treatment of Bordeaux applied to control it, as the lime-sulphur will not be effective. Directions for this will be gladly furnished by your experiment station. The idea of putting new life into the old orchard is not altogether a new one, but it is one which has received but very little attention be - cause the fruit tide has not been as high for years as it now is. There - fore, in their eagerness to get fruit in the shortest possible length of time, this idea is to become very popular in the near future, no matter what your neighbor says about it. This is comparatively a new field of work, and I have covered it as fully as I can under the present circumstances, as there is to be a lot of learning along this line yet, and the coming season I hope to be able to give out some more data on the subject. Meanwhile do some experi - menting on your own orchard, and give us the results of your experience. — Omer R. Abraham, in the Fruit Grower. THE 8TATE FAIR FRUIT EXHIBITS. In quantity the 1912 fruit show at the Nebraska State Pair by the State Horticultural Society was the largest ever staged. The south half of the state is maturing one of the biggest crops on record, and there is a sprinkling of fruit over all of the north half. The quality was good, but owing to the tardiness of the late varieties in putting on color the show lacked somewhat in that respect as compared with last season, when the fruit colored very early. </seg>

As usual the bulk of the exhibit was comprised of apples, but an ex - traordinary showing of pears was in evidence. The people of the state have generally considered pear growing as a failure until within the past few years, when pears have been doing better each year, and the present season the pear crop is of such proportions that they are being shipped in car lots from Otoe, Nemaha and other southeastern counties. Grapes also appeared to good advantage this season, as well as plums. The only de - partment that was not up to the standards of former years was the peach exhibition. The severe weather of two years ago killed almost all of the pitch trees in the state. Growers have not lost faith in the peach for Nebraska, however, as evidenced by the talk of planting peach orchards the coming spring. Several prominent fruit growers are now planning to plant commercial peach orchards next year. The following counties were represented by county collective exhibits of fruit and rated in the order named: Nemaba by Duncan and Hessel - ine of Peru; Washington by Marshall Bros, of Arlington; Pawnee by C.

SPRAYING APPLE TREES. By Prof. R. F. Howard, University of Nebraska. In every fruit growing locality there are men who refrain from grow - ing apples merely because they have the idea that it is an exceedingly ex - pensive and complex operation to protect the trees and crops from their natural insect and fungous enemies. This attitude not only characterizes a class of men not actually in the business, but it applies to a certain class of orchard owners. In general this is not true of our largest growers — men who have most of their in - terest and capital in the business. They have found, as men will find in every line of business when their future depends upon the success with which it is operated, that a certain amount of attention is as necessary to successful fruit growing as it is to growing any other crop. On the other hand, the number of apple trees in the state not receiving this at - tention probably aggregate more than those in "commercial orchards." Men who are familiar with the apple growing industry in the central west know it is useless to attempt to grow apples now free from insect and fungous blemishes without spraying. The early settlers did not have to give their trees this attention. They were able to grow fruit free from these things because fruit tree pests, like many of our social evils, were not known until civilization was fairly well established. In a way this is un - fortunate for it usually takes a generation to get any new agricultural practice into operation after its need becomes evident. The department of horticulture of the University began a series of </seg>
            <seg id="p206">206 NEBRASKA STATE HOKTICrLTLRAL SOCIETY. braska on apple orchards to show the growers the beneficial effect* of spraying to produce fruits free from these pests and to determine just what its cost would be under Nebraska conditions. This work was car - ried on in twenty-two orchards, representing eighteen localities in thir - teen counties. The conclusions drawn from this work are based on the results under all sorts of conditions extending over this period. E Apple scab and the codling moth worm are the two most troublesome s the growers have to contend with in this state. The apple scab is Dgous disease that develops rapidly under certain favorable weather conditions and infests both the leaves and fruits of most of our cultivated varieties of apples. It makes its appearance about the time the trees are in bloom causing numerous brown patches upon the leaves and a scabby like growth upon the fruits. The worm so often found inside the apples la the larva of a small moth. This pest has reached such a stage of de - velopment in eastern Nebraska that we cannot expect to get more than 10 to 15 per cent of the apples free from the worms without spraying. Four sprayings are necessary to hold these two troublesome pests in check. Spraying to prevent apple scab should be regarded as a pre - ventative and not as a cure, for when the disease once gets into the tissues of the plant any spray material that we could use with safety to the tree would not stop its development. The object then is to thoroughly coat all parts of the tree with something that will prevent the spores from germi - nating. The materials most commonly used for this purpose are lime sulphur solution or Bordeaux mixture. Lime sulphur is a commercial preparation that may be bought on the market in a concentrated form. It should be diluted about thirty times before being put on apple trees. As a similar spray, Bordeaux mixture may be made by slacking four pounds of store lime in a small quantity of water and diluting it to twenty - live gallons and then adding to it twenty-five gallons of water in which four pounds of copper sulphate (blue stone) has been dissolved. Lead arsenate in the proportion of two pounds to fifty gallons of spray material Is used for controlling the worm. The first application is for scab only and should consist of either lime sulphur or Bordeaux mixture. The proper time for making the first appli - cation is just before the flowers open. The second application should con - sist of the same material as the first application plus two pounds of lead arsenate dissolved in each fifty gallons and should be put on immediately after the flowers begin to drop. This is the most important spraying and It should be directed downward and with as much force as possible in order to get some of the poison into the blossom end of the apple before the little lobes cross. About three weeks later, the second spraying should be repeated. The fourth and last application should be given about the middle of July and should consist of lead arsenate and water two pounds to fifty gallons. The department of horticulture found that the cost of these four ap - plications, including the cost of all material and labor was about twenty - four cents per tree. A grown apple tree in an ordinary year should bear over five bushels, making the cost of producing clean fruit free from worms less than five cents per bushel. </seg>
            <seg id="p207">IIBW SHADE TKEE PF.8T. 207 There is no better land for apple growing to be found anywhere than in eastern Nebraska. This is especially true of those counties bordering the Missouri river from Burt to the extreme southeast corner of the state, including Nemaha and Johnson counties. Considering the cheapness of some of this bluff land, one wonders why so many investors from this state, who are anxious to go into the fruit business are rushing to the western states where the raw land alone is costing them three to five hundred dollars per acre. Orchards on our Missouri river bluff lands, if given the same good care that characterizes western methods, will pro - duce fruit equal in quality to any fruit growing region in America. Where western competitors have to pay approximately 50 cents per bushel to get their product to the markets, we have our own markets here at our door. No better evidence could be cited that eastern Nebraska possesses real merit as an apple producing section, than the fact that some of the best growers in the state and of the state horticultural society are leasing every available orchard in this region. NEW SHADE TREE PEST HERE. Pithin the past year a new pest of shade trees has appeared commonly coin which until about two years ago was entirely unknown in the This pest is known as the bagworm, because of the characteristic habit of the caterpillar of enclosing itself in a baglike case, within which it makes its growth and transformations. In the fall the fully grown cater - pillars attach these bags to the twigs of trees and after the leaves have fallen they may be found rather easily upon close scrutiny of the trees. This pest increased in numbers last year to such an extent that, con - sidering its^reputation as a shade-tree defoliator in eastern and southern cities, fear is expressed of possible ill effect on Lincoln trees, especially valued evergreens. Although last year the bagworm was found attack - ing only deciduous trees in Lincoln, at least as far as information is avail - able, wherever it becomes established and evergreen trees are available ■ it greatly prefers to feed upon these, and since evergreens are usually greatly injured with only one defoliation, there is need of watching these very closely. In Lincoln it was found mostly on boxelder and maple last year, but also on elm, sycamore and plum; and poplar, willow, oak, catalpa, locust, linden, apple, pear, cherry and apricot are known to be commonly injured trees in other cities. Among the evergreens it prefers arbor vitae and red cedar but practically all are attacked. "There is but one generation of the bagworm in a year," said Pro - fessor Swenk of the state university. "The insect passes the winter in the egg state in these bags hanging in the trees. Late in the spring, in May or early June, these eggs hatch and the tiny caterpillars desert tfce. bags and scatter over the adjacent leaves, upon which they feed. These caterpillars are very soft bodied and soon each one begins the construc - tion of a protecting case or bag composed of silk with bits of leaves inter - woven to give additional strength, and this bag is continually enlarged as </seg>
            <seg id="p208">208 the caterpillar increases in size. By latter August the caterpillars are fully grown, when they become restless and wander to other trees and shrubs, finally attaching the bag by silken strands to a twig and within it transforming to the chrysalis stage. About three weeks later the adult moths are formed, and while the winged males emerge from the bag and fly about, the wingless grublike females half fill the empty chrysalis skin with eggs, sometimes several hundred or more of them, and then force their way out of the bag, fall to the ground and die. These eggs survive the winter in the bag and hatch out the following spring, as described. "The bagworm is a southern insect which is extending its range north - ward and westward up the Missouri valley. It was found abundantly in ariouB localities in the vicinity of Rulo during the present winter, prin - ipally in the river bottom among the willows and in the bozelders and edars in the town. One farmer near Falls City, who has a grove of about wo hundred cedars and pines from eighteen to twenty-five feet high, had hem extensively injured and destroyed by this pest last summer. Appar - ently the insect has been established in Richardson county for several ears. "The first indication of its presence in the city of Lincoln was the nding of a female cocoon on a boxelder tree at the corner of Twenty - second and N streets two years ago this month. The following August a second specimen was found, this time a female larva on the ground at 'hirty-third and Starr streets. No more were discovered until last Au - gust, when a female was found on a sycamore near Thirty-third and Dud - ey streets, but since then, and all through the present winter numerous pecimens have been found, indicating that the insect last season gained quite general distribution in East Lincoln. Up to date a total of eighty - wo bagworms or bags have been found within the city limits, at the olio win K locations: Twenty-second and N, Twenty-second and O, Twenty-fifth and O, Seventeenth and P, Eleventh and Q, Twenty-first and i. Twenty-first and R, Fourteenth and S, Twenty-seventh and S, Tenth and T, Thirteenth and T, Thirteenth and U, Fourteenth and Vine, Twenty - eventh and Vine, Thirtieth and Vine, Twenty-fourth and Y, Twenty-ninth and Y, Thirty-third and Dudley, and Thirty-third and Starr. "This pest is subject to fluctuations in abundance from year to year, according to the efficiency of its parasites in controlling it during each particular season, but at irregular intervals it breaks out and causes much njury to the shade and ornamental trees of the streets and parks of the nfested cities. Five years ago there was such an outbreak in Washing - ton, Baltimore, Harrisburg, St. Louis and other cites in New Jersey, Penn - ylvania, Maryland, the Virginias, Ohio, Indiana and Illinois. 'This insect is just getting established in Lincoln. All of the bags found seem to be fresh and apparently not parasitized, so that it seem* likely that the insect will further intrench itself during the coming sum - mer. If every person who sees one or several of these bags hanging in the trees of his premises or elsewhere would see to it that they are picked and destroyed before spring, the pest could be prevented from gaining a </seg>

Every bag destroyed means several hundred or more caterpillars less next summer. The other con - trol measure is spraying the trees with arsenical poisons at the hatching time of the eggs, especially on the evergreens, where the hand picking is more difficult and the injury more severe, but this involves considerable expense and labor and could well be avoided." SOILS. Paper Read by Alfred Burton Before the Florists' Club of Philadelphia, April 2, 1912. What is soil? Soil is the home of the roots of the plant. Soil is the storehouse for that part of the food which the plant takes in through its roots. Soil is the laboratory or kitchen where the food is prepared. And this work goes on unceasingly. Lastly, soil is a support to hold the plant firmly in its place. But what is soil? Soil is finely divided rock as can be readily s*en with a microscope, clay being the finest and sand and gravel the coarsest of the divisions. In between the sand and the clay we have what are generally known as loamy sand, sandy loam, loam, clayey loam, loamy clay and clay. These divisions are based upon the size of the soil grains and the different percentages of each size in a given soil. They are, of course, not arbitrarily fixed, there being innumerable variations of soils. Now, if we consider soils as broken and decomposed rocks, the first question that comes to our mind is, how and when were the rocks which originally covered the face of the earth converted into soil? Certainly ages and ages before man appeared on the earth. In fact before animal life of any kind could exist there must have been vegetation; and vege - tation of the higher forms could not exist on bare rocks. Probably the commencement of the disintegration was coincident with the appearance of plant life in the lowest form. Geologists tell us that the earth was once a molten mass, also that the water which now composes the oceans was probably in the form of a dense vapor which surrounded the red hot earth. Naturally, the earth began to cool and as it cooled it contracted. The result of this was that the surface subsided in some places and wrinkled in others, thus pro - ducing the sea basins, valleys and hills. When the surface had cooled sufficiently (and this cooling was hastened by the vapor in the air) the vapor condensed and fell as rain or snow, and thus began to wear or weather the rock. Frost and heat assisted the water in disintegrating and breaking up the surface. Sometimes after the surface had cooled suf - ficiently vegetation began its existence. First, in almost microscopic forms, the mosses and lichens which are able to extract nourishment from </seg>
            <seg id="p210">210 NEBRASKA 8TATE HORTICI IT I i:\I- s. &gt;■ almost any rock. These by their death and decay formed a very thin film of vegetable matter on the rock and stronger growth took place which in turn died, decayed, and gave way to a still stronger growth and higher form of vegetation, and so on till grass, shrubs and even trees, were able to exist. This decayed vegetable matter in the soil is called humus. And this humus helps to disintegrate the rock by holding moisture and by sup - plying acids which increase the solvent powers of the water on the rock. When a soil contains much of this humus it is called a vegetable mold. Rich garden soils are good representatives of this class. A soil contain - ing vegetable matter that has only partly decomposed under water is called peaty soil. Such soils are found in swamps and bogs, and are gen- erally sour and need to be aerated and limed before using. While organic matter or humus is by no means indispensable to plant life, and though it is a debatable question whether plants derive any nour - ishment from it direct, it is of great importance in enabling; the soil to hold water, in making the soil more friable and easily worked, and in sup- plying the carbonic acid which feeds the plant and acts on the soil, dis - solving and making available other foods such as soda, potash and mag - nesium, which are held in an insoluble state in the soil. Humus also gives the dark color to the soil which enables it to absorb the beat rays of the sun more readily and thus warm up more quickly in the spring. True clay is composed of silicate of alumina, but the term clay in agriculture is employed rather loosely, being given to soils that contain a large percentage of impalpable rock dust with very little of the true clay present Some authorities give the following percentage composition of the various soils Clay or impalpable matter Sand Heavy clay contains 75 to 90 per cent 10 to 25 per cent Clay loam 60 to 75 per cent 25 to 40 per cent Loam 40 to 60 per cent 40 to 60 per cent Sandy loam 25 to 40 per cent 60 to 75 per cent Light sandy loam 10 to 25 per cent 75 to 90 per cent Sand 0 to 10 per cent 90 to 10» per cent These percentages are by weight of the dry soil. We hear the term light and heavy soil applied to soils. These terms have no reference to the weight of the soil but are used in reference to the mechanical condi - tion. A light soil is one that contains considerable sand, falls apart and works easily. A heavy soil is one that is stiff and tenacious, with more clay than sand. It is a fact that a heavy soil actually weighs less than a light one. A tenacious or adhesive clay soil can be greatly improved by the ad - dition of sand, lime or vegetable matter, which tend to separate the par - ticles of clay. It is this adhesiveness or clay which causes heavy soil to crack when drying. Clay expands very much more than light soils when wet, and shrinks upon drying, and owing to the adhesiveness of the par - ticles of which it is composed the shrinkage causes the cracks to appear. These cracks are naturally injurious to the roots of the plants, breaking </seg>
            <seg id="p211">211 and pulling them apart. Sand does not change its bulk by wetting or dry - ing. Likewise a sandy soil can be improved mechanically by the addition of clay, lime or vegetable matter. Lime has the peculiar power of lighten- t heavy soils and also of making light soils hold together better, bring - the two extremes to a happy mean as it were. The general chemical composition of soils is extremely similar, owing to the general mixing of the soil ingredients that has been going on since soil first began to form; through the action of water, dissolving and carry - ing material from place to place, through the action of streams, floods and glaciers of burrowing animals, worms, etc., of the wind and even plants. Silica or quartz, because it is so hard and insoluble, is the chief ingredient both by volume and weight of all soils. It is a combination of silica and oxygen. Aluminum probably comes next in abundance, being a funda - mental constituent of true clay, feldspar and ice mica. Some of the other elements in the soil are oxygen, which occurs free and in combination with nearly all the other elements. Carbon occurs as part of the humus, also united with calcium and magnesium in the form of carbonates, also as car - bonic acid gas, which plays such an important part in the solution of plant food. Sulphur occurs as sulfates. Hydrogen is united with oxygen in the water. Chlorine occurs in limited quantities, generally in the form of common salt sodium chloride. It seems to be in some way essential to plant life. Phosphorus is never found in nature in a free state but always combined with some other substance. It is very generally distributed through the soil, but in small quantities, and is very essential to plant life. Nitrogen is found in the soil in a combined form in the humus and the vegetable and animal matter which, upon decaying, gives us the nitrogen in the form of ammonia, which is turned into nitric acid by bacteria. The nitric acid unites with potash, soda or other soil ingredients and is taken up by the plant as a nitrate. Nitrates are extremely soluble and easily washed out of the soil. Calcium and magnesium in the form of carbonates compose the limestone beds of the earth. Both calcium carbonate or lime and magnesia are necessary plant foods, and both are generally present in the soil in sufficient quantities to supply the plant with the required amount. Potassium is another element found in soils which is very necessary. It is widely distributed as a constituent of some feldspars and micas. Sodium, which is the base of common salt, is also widely distributed; it very much resembles potassium as a chemical element, but can in no sense take its place in plant life. Iron is always present in the soil in sufficient quan - tities for the plant. It would be supposed that to find what foods were necessary for soil* all that would be necessary would be a chemical analysis of the particular soil. Then, if any element was found to be lacking in sufficient quantity, the addition of this or these elements would give the desired results. But chemical analyses of the soil, as they have been made, unfortunately can and do throw but a very dim and uncertain light upon either the condition or the amount of plant food a soil may contain. It is true that the results of these analyses show a marked difference in soils but, from the data at hand, these variations may reasonably be </seg>

Taking an average of different analyses of soils, the following has been stated by one writer: On a farm where a three year rotation, composed of corn, clover and oats, was followed, the corn and oats being sold, and the straw, fodder and clover returned to the ground, the soil would contain potash enough to last 1521 years; soda, 4050 years; magnesia, 3300 years; lime, 4367 years; phos - phoric acid, only 542 years; sulfuric acid, 292 years; and soluble silica, 17, - 150 years. These amounts of plant food are what chemical analyses have told us were in the top foot of soil, and we know that plants send their roots foraging two, three and four feet down. And the subsoil is sometimes richer in certain ingredients than the surface or top soil. Seeing these figures, a man taking up farming, who was not familiar with agricultural or horticultural pursuits would think it superfluous to add any more of these elements to his ground. While his fields contained already nearly two tons P, O. in each acre, and over three tons K, O, of what earthly use would it be to add a paltry 25 or 50 pounds more? Why, it would be lost! A chemist with the most accurate and careful analysis could never find it; it would be money thrown away. tBut we know from practical experience that ninety-nine times out of ndred his crops would be increased more than enough to pay for the ure or fertilizer added. We know that, in spite of these figures, which there is no reason at all to doubt, soils do need fertilizing, they do play out, that farms do run down and become unproductive. And only by feed - ing can the soil be kept up to its full fertility. So we cannot be governed by a chemical analysis as to the different elements our soils need. The only way is by trials, experiments and careful observation. The most important thing in considering a soil, to my mind, is the mechanical condition. Is it too stiff or too light for your purpose? Has it enough humus or organic matter incorporated in it? The proportions of clay, loam and sand can be readily ascertained in a laboratory with a simple apparatus; the percentage of humus can also be ascertained by analysis. But a practical man can judge a soil very closely by feeling it and observing how it works. Fortunately for the florist, he uses a com - paratively small amount of soil, measuring it by the load instead of the acre, and can afford to amend or ameliorate his soil and so change its mechanical condition to suit his particular needs. In all probabilities, the greatest necessity will be humus. The cheapest way to add this is by plowing under a growing crop. Legumes are always preferable for green manuring as it is called, because they increase the amount of nitrogen in the soil and nitrogen is the most expensive element of plant food we have to buy. It is well to lime the soil before sowing a crop to be turned under, a* adding a large quantity of green material is apt to sour the soil for a little while, also the legume family do better in soil that contains lime. It seems to be necessary for the proper development of the bacteria which cause the nodules to appear on the roots of clover and other legumes. </seg>
            <seg id="p213">' 213 Soils generally, have the power of fixing the plant food added to them. By fixing, we mean folding the food in such a state that it cannot be washed out by the rain. This is true of phosphoric acid and potash, but nitrogen is very easily lost by leaching in the form of nitrates and, under certain conditions, escaping into the air as free N. The best way to hold the nitrogen is to keep the fields filled with growing crops, catch crops as they are called. These make use of the nitrogen and return it to the soil when plowed under. But it is only the clovers and others of that family that add more nitrogen than was originally in the soil. Clays hold the plant food more firmly than sandy soils and the same is true of moisture. Humus also helps to hold the moisture by absorbing it in the same way a sponge does, while clay holds it by surrounding it as though it were in a cup. Oxygen or fresh air is very necessary to the soil to promote the growth of the innumerable bacteria that are always present in a fertile soil and to assist the chemical reactions that are continually going on. When the water in soil evaporates or is used by the plant, air rushes in to take its place. When more water is added, air and any injurious gases which may have been formed are driven out, and when this water is gone more fresh air is taken in. Also fresh air is taken into the soil at night. When the evening comes on the soil cools and shrinks and air is drawn In to fill the vacant spaces. The opposite occurs when the soil grains expand with the heat in the morning. So you might say that the soil takes a breath once every twenty-four hours. THE HOME GARDEN. This article is written in the hope that it may assist the amateur, and from a western viewpoint. Make garden east and west — 50 by 150 is a nice size, fence well, anchoring corners so they can't get away. .Use high, strong fence and chicken tight. Plant grapes, each six feet on south side one foot from fence inside. Plant currants and gooseberries each six feet and two feet from fence on north side. At one end plant asparagus, win - ter onions, rhubarb and horse-radish, at other end have a strawberry bed. Plow garden early in spring and some deeper each year until one foot deep. Mine was plowed eleven inches last spring. If land has not been manured regularly spread well rotted manure on ground before plowing and use light coat on top. Do not use too much and rake until fine. Plow with two horses with 12- or 14-inch plow. Throw ground out one year and in next. When throwing it in use one horse during last few rounds and plow more shallow so as not to molest roots of fruit plants; your single tree will not catch in fence and all your ground will be utilized. Mulch currants, gooseberries, grapes and both ends of garden each fall with straw except strawberry bed. On that use some damaged hay if you can. Tour hones can turn on beds at end of garden without damage to stock planted Garden tools are very useful, but a comman rake and hoe will do. </seg>

To name varieties to plant is unneces - sary. Ask your nearest gardener. Take mulching from grapes in spring and cultivate. Take enough off strawberry plants so they can come through. Leave mulching around currant, gooseberry and stock on end. Avoid presence of trees if you court success. JOHN F. BARR. Hastings, Adams County, Nebr. A COMMERCIAL ORCHARD IN EASTERN NEBRA8KA. C. G. Marshall. In March, 1911, the writer, in partnership with Val Keyser, then super - ntendent of farmers' institutes, leased the thirty-acre orchard owned by A. A. Lasch, near Weeping Water, Cass county, on a term contract. Nine undred trees (about twenty acres) of this orchard were twenty years old nd were composed mainly of the following varieties: Ben Davis, Wine - sap, Jonathan and Genet, with a few trees each of Pewaukee, Maiden's Blush, Walbridge and Whitney. Four hundred trees (about eight acres) were seven and nine years old, and composed chiefly of Jonathan, Black 'wig and Gano. This orchard had had somewhat better care than many orchards in eastern Nebraska of the same age. Its management had been left largely to hired help, however, Mr. Lasch's interests in Michigan having kept him utside of the state the greater part of each year, and it had been neglected o its detriment. Cultivation had been discontinued a number of years ago and a stiff bloegrass sod had formed in a greater part of the older orchard. 'he pruning also had been neglected until there was a surplus of wood in be head of almost every tree. It had been sprayed a few times during its zistence, but with machinery of insufficient capacity to do efficient work. Experiments and demonstrations had caused us to believe that the </seg>
            <seg id="p215">A COMMERCIAL ORCHARD. 215 natural conditions for apple growing in eastern Nebraska were sur - passed by few sections of the country, and that the chief handicap to profit - able apple orcharding had been neglect. Believing that strictly up-to-date methods of orchard management should be practiced in Nebraska as well as elsewhere to make orcharding pay, and that eastern Nebraska orchards would respond to such treatment equally as well as orchards in other sections of the United States, plans were made to handle the orchard in the most up-to-date manner possible. Accordingly the orchard was carefully pruned, reducing the amount of wood to let air and sunlight to all parts of the tree, to reduce the fruiting wood so that all fruit would be properly nourished, to shape the heads so that spraying mixtures could be applied thoroughly to all parts of the tree, and to remove all suckers, water sprouts and weak branches. I Eight hundred oil burning heaters were purchased and placed among Ben Davis, Winesap and Jonathans in the older part of the orchard at rate of fifty heaters per acre. A carload of fuel oil (6,000 gallons) ting 2% cents per gallon laid down at Weeping Water, was placed in a vanized storage tank just outside the orchard. This tank set in the e of a steep bank, where the oil from the tank wagon could be unloaded &gt; it by gravity by driving the wagon above it, and where the wagon ild be again loaded from the storage tank by gravity by driving It on lower side. A modern, gasoline-power sprayer, a reversible extension c and other equipment essential to the proper handling of an orchard, re provided. The heaters were fired but once last spring. There was but one period after the blossoms opened when the temperature reached freezing. By 12 o'clock on the night of May 1 the temperature had dropped to 30 degrees with a slight wind from a little to the north of west. We started the fires, beginning at the northeast corner of the orchard and following the north line of heating pots to the west side, then down the outside row on the west side, and then-every other row was lighted north and south, working east from the west side. The reservoir type of heaters was used, and in the rush the first ones lighted on the north and west sides were not care - fully regulated, and on returning to this part of the orchard some time later it was found that the valves had been closed to such an extent that the fires in many had gone out. Frost was forming on the vegetation near the ground and even on the lids of the fire pots where the fires had died out. The thermometers showed a temperature of 27 degrees and the ground was slightly frozen where it was bare. Farther east where the fires burned steadily no frost was apparent, even though this part of the orchard was considerably lower and the movement of air less. Until late in the season we were of the opinion that no good resulted from the artificial heat, as trees outside the heated area in this orchard set fruit and almost every apple tree in eastern Nebraska that put out blossoms set and produced fruit. As the fruit began to gain size and color it could be noticed that the trees bordering on the north and west sides of the orchard were carrying a lighter crop, and when the fruit was gathered </seg>
            <seg id="p216">216 Flight yield corresponded very closely to the area where the fires went and frost formed. There was not another orchard in Cass county, or anywhere in eastern Nebraska coming under our notice, where the crop was so even as in this orchard, and this condition was attributed to the artificial heat. Almost erery tree in the heated area, except those on the north and west sides, carried a full crop, and it was evenly distributed all through the trees. In other orchards similarly located and equally well treated, other than the heating, the crops were more or less spotted and uneven. Quite often the yield was mainly from one side of the trees or from certain parts of the I The orchard was sprayed four times during the season. The first &gt;lication was of Bordeaux mixture, which was applied Just after the ster buds opened, but before the individual flowers opened (about April . This application was directed mainly against apple scab and other ieous diseases. The second application was made when the ground :an to appear white from falling petals. This was directed mainly linst codling moth, and two pounds of lead-arsenate to fifty gallons of ter was used. One and one-third gallons of commercial lime-sulphur s added to each fifty gallons of the above mixture, and which was ected against fungus. The third application was of the same material for the second and was applied about twenty days after the petals had len. The fourth application was of the same material and was applied tut seven weeks after the third. The spraying was a success, the insects and fungus were kept almost completely under control. Fungous injury was nowhere in evidence, and in no part of the orchard was the fruit more than 5 per cent wormy, tree run. The Jonathan were less than 1 per cent wormy, while the orchard as a whole ran less than 3 per cent wormy fruit. The lime-sulphur was used as a fungicide after the first spraying, and the fruit was absolutely smooth, showing no spray iniury. as is often the case when Bordeaux mixture is used for the later sprayings. Thorough cultivation was practiced throughout the season. The orchard was gone over with the reversible extension disc at frequent inter - vals, at all times maintaining a clean surface and a soil mulch. The results of the cultivation were very satisfactory. Although the season was extremely dry in eastern Nebraska, neither the trees nor the fruit suffered to any great extent from the drouth, while in uncultivated orchards there was more or less drouth injury, resulting in small fruit and weakened The older part of the orchard bore heavily. The winter varieties aver - aging almost four barrels per tree, the total production being in excess of 10,000 bushels. Several thousand bushels of this fruit was still on the trees at the time of the severe freeze, November 1, and was rendered unfit for anything but cider and vinegar. Our inability to secure sufficient experienced help and the early freeze were the cause for this loss of fruit. LThe bulk of the crop was packed in barrels and placed in storage in ha.

Our share of the boxed fruit found a market in Lincoln in competition with western boxed apples at from $1.50 a box for Ben Davis and $2 to $2.25 per box for Jonathan and Winesap. The barrel fruit stored in Omaha Bold for from $2.50 to $3.75 per barrel for Ben Davis, according to the grade. We were offered at harvest time $1 per 100 pounds for the crop placed on the grading table, but preferred to pick and market it ourselves. The whole production sold at the lowest prices offered for sprayed fruit would have sold for over $4,000. The older part of the orchard (twenty acres) produced almost 10,000 bushels, or 500 bushels per acre. THE ARNOLD ARBORETUM OF BOSTON. One of the most interesting botanical collections in the world is in this arboretum. The horticultural treasures of the world have been gathered here. C. S. Sargent, who has written that colossal work, "The Sylva of North America" has charge of it. Jackson Dawson, the world's greatest propagator, is superintendent. Miracles seem to fall from his hands. I do not know how many kinds of roses he has originated. He has a collec - tion of 150 kinds of lilacs alone, and when you see them in bloom In the genial climate of Massachusetts you are in Wonderland. The director, Professor Sargent, has sent out many explorers. E. H. Wilson made four journeys into China for the arboretum. He went about 700 miles into regions never traversed before. His trip was tight to a sudden close by a broken leg occasioned by an earth avalanche, had to endure every kind of hardship and privation. He found mountains piled upon mountains. They were wedged and* crowded together, so the progress was exceedingly slow. There were hardships and privations all along the way. Sometimes a tremendous cloudburst would break npon them, and they would be drenched to the skin. Sometimes they would find partial shelter in a rude hovel, which would leak like a sieve and the earth floor would be a quagmire. But finally he reached a marvelous region, filled with rare plants and trees. He collected seeds of fifty kinds of conifers, and also secured 150 kinds of shrubs and plants new to the horticultural world. Mr. Wilson says the . greatest surprise of the expedition was the discovery of an entirely new kind of peach. What this discovery will amount to we can not tell at present. It may be the mother of an entirely new race. Think of this marvelous addition to the great park by one man. I have spent hours wandering through these marvelous collections, often lying or sitting on the ground and taking time for a careful survey. Here are all kinds of the viburnum or snowball family — a long list of spireas and perhaps twenty kinds of syringas among them, some new creations of Dawson's. If a man wants to broaden himself in horticulture he should take his time and visit these grounds when the different families of shrubs are in full bloom. He will mourn that so many things which do well in the soft, humid climate of the east can not be grown here, and he must shut out most of the </seg>

But this will turn his attention to the fact that there are hosts of things which will do well in the west as well as in the east. We think of the wide contrast between this great arUoretum of the eastern parks and then hang our heads as we think of the poor, miserable Lincoln parks, and the repulsive approaches to our capital city. C. S. HARRISON. York, Neb. SPECIALS IN GARDENING. By L. 0. Williams, University Place. This is a day of specializing in many lines of business and professions. The "specialist" is one who devotes his talents and time to one or two particular lines of work, even though he may pay some attention to several side lines. Even the great department stores of our cities are in a measure an aggregation of "specialists," since every department has a special manager or superinlendent to look after its affairs. The professional market gardener must of necessity be likened to a department store. The modern market garden should contain from twenty-five to thirty classes of vegetables, each class being divided up into varieties of from two 01 ten. This would seem to imitate a regular "variety store" rather than a department store, for the professional gar - dener has to supervise the planting and care of each and every variety tflat he grows. If it were practicable for the garden to be divided up into separate plats, each one being devoted to a separate class, the ideal of the department garden might be realized. This plan of separation giving each class a particular soil and location adapted to its wants is followed to a certain extent. ADAPTATION OF VARIETIES The adaptation of certain vegetables to particular soils and locations should receive the attention of every gardener. It is this idea that gives rise to the primary thought I first had in mind when I began to discuss "specials." There are many small growers of vegetables who have neither the capital nor ability to carry on a general garden — keeping up a full line of varieties. Such person may find by a little observation and study the fitness of their particular soil and location for this or that vegetable — including a half dozen kinds perhaps, and by giving his special attention to these cer - tain lines he may win special success. There are many locations in or about the city of Lincoln where the man or woman with a taste for garden - ing could rent a few vacant lots and by studying the adaptation of that particular soil to certain vegetables could make such otherwise idle ground produce highly profitable returns. The matter of markets should also be considered in determining the line of planting to be followed. If one should find a special demand for early potatoes at good prices in his par- </seg>

If his or her talent, soil, and market incline to tomato growing, then make the tomato your "mascot." THE MELON "SPECIAL" The melon is a "fruit" that is adapted to specialization very well, more so perhaps than any other line of gardening. The melon requires a warm, sandy loam for best results. A soil with plenty of humus in it, such as we find from partially decayed vegetable mould in newly broken timber land or prairie sod is very well suited to the melon. E-ral years ago I had about half an acre of ground that had recently pasture. It was planted at first to strawberries, but owing to the ! of numerous white grubs the plantation was abandoned. The next spring I planted it to melons, mostly cantaloupes, with a few rows of watermelons. The harvest of fruit from this half acre was very gratifying. The rowdy men and boys of the town took their toll by night, and I gave another tithe offering by day. Aside from this I had the pleasure of marketing right at home a good surplus at generous prices. The patch yielded me a gross return of between $90 and $100. Last season I took advantage of another tract of sod land — second cropping — by planting to The "Rocky Fords" did especially well in both yield and quality. They sold in competition with the Colorado brands at 40 to 75 cents per I know a man near Bethany who has made a specialty of the water - melon for several years. He selects new soils when possible that are adapted to this fruit, planting some seasons as high as twenty acres. It is true that he has to defend his patch at ripening time by special patrol - men but if one were to judge by the wagonloads of melons the owner brings to our market, there must be something more than a mere living in the melon specials. OTHER SPECIALTIES Celery is a vegetable that requires more expert care and adaptation of soil than any other plant that I am familiar with. The regular gardener who attempts to grow It in connection with a full line of other vegetables is quite sure to find it unprofitable. From personal experiences I am sure that I had rather pay the retail price for the "Kalamazoo" article than attempt to grow it in my own garden. Several years ago I bought a small tract of ground in Platte Center, Neb., that by nature seemed just suited to the production of celery. The man of whom I bought the ground had a twenty-acre field devoted to this plant at the tlm» of my purchase. His specialties were "celery and onions Mn car lots." The tract of ground devoted to this industry had been recov - ered from swamp lands by means of drainage ditches. Despite these seeming favored conditions of soil and irrigation facilities, the growing of this specialty was finally abandoned. There was too much risk because of early fall freezes and diseases to which the celery is subject. </seg>
            <seg id="p220">220 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. THE ONION The onion is a subject well suited to the garden specialist Its requirements are a clean, well-tilled and prepared soil, early planting and Intense cultivation. The man who understands its nature and needs and will give it the attention it deserves at just the right time can coin money enough for his needs and to spare for himself and a family of children, who should be his partners in this work. THE POTATO The potato Is deserving the attention particularly of the man who wants a specialty. It is a staple article of food that is popular with Americans, whether they be Irish or otherwise. The man who can make a "hit" in securing a crop of these tubers from year to year had better tick to the business, even though he may suffer occasional partial failures. 'here is a big, wide-open market for the potato right here at home, and at be prices obtained for this product last year on the Lincoln market there ■ sure to be an increased activity among our potato growers in its pro - uction. Success with the potato depends largely upon the three factors f soil, seed and cultivation. Special study should be given to the building up and maintenance of soils adapted to potato production. THE FRONT YARD. C. 8. Harrison, York. The most important part of the farm is often the most neglected. 'his should always give a favorable introduction to the whole place. What would you think of a horse which had a perfect body and a fine silver mounted harness if his head didn't match the rest of him? His face is scarred, his ears are cropped, and he has on an old, worn-out bridle which s in strange contrast to the rest of the harness. You would say the head was not a fair introduction to the horse. Here is a palatial residence with tumble-down porch — that isn't fair. It is an offense to the public. It pays to keep things in shape. A nurseryman, with some friends, rode by a place well adorned with rees. It had just been sold for $16,000. An estimate was made of the itra price it brought on account of the trees. After comparing notes the pinion was that the trees added $2,000. "Yes," said the nurseryman. You are doubtless correct. Fifteen years ago he paid me $25 for those rees." Pretty good interest on the money, was it not? While the house, lie barn, the fences, cribs, granary, and all other improvements begin to epreciate as soon as completed, the ornamentals you plant begin to ncrease in value. You take a couple of picea pungens — Colorado blue, pruce — they will cost you $5 a pair. Give them room to throw out their ranches in symmetrical form and they will grow into shapes of wondrous beauty. There they stand, like sentinels on guard in that lawn of yours, adorned in the most resplendent robes of mingled silver and sapphire. </seg>

I have known $100 apiece to be refused for such trees as you might have. Then take a pair of Rocky Mountain silver fir, the Concolor, there is one growing here in York, the owner would not put a price on. There are some on those princely estates in the Bast which money could not buy. In color they are ermine and emerald. Their beauty increases with age. With trunks straight as an arrow, with branches of the finest symmetry, perfect in form, and adorned with that exquisite foliage which makes a tree of unmis - takable attractiveness. It will grow for you. I have seen them doing well in the sod, in a cemetery, out on the open prairie. In the Arnold Arbore - tum, in Boston, there is a tree lilac, Syringa Japonica, it is thirty years from seed. Time and again it has been photographed. Just think of a tree, about a foot through, with the massive head one vast bouquet of bloom. This, as well as the Chinese tree lilacs, do well on our Nebraska prairies. From the window where I write I can see a group of Chinese tree lilacs, ten years old, that are four inches through and fifteen to eighteen feet tall. You see, they grow about as fast and as large as our native ash. I do not suppose the one in the Arboretum could be bought at any price. These trees would grow for you as well as anyone. With me they do as well as ash or elms. Just think of these trees loaded with a great mass of honey-scented, white flowers. There is that new shrub which has recently been originated by Professor Hanson, a cross between the purple plum and the sand cherry, giving a charming purple-leaved shrub of marvelous beauty. It is not yet fully disseminated, but will be in a few years. Such an ornamental bush would be almost priceless. Take the great family of lilacs, at least 100 varieties will thrive in the West and Northwest. They give you a wide diversity of form and foliage, while the time of blooming reaches from early spring till the first of July. How much of pleasure such a collection would afford. Then take the large family of viburnums, or snowballs, at least six varieties do well on our prairies, and are hardy in the North. There are many things which can be used to beautify the home, which, though not expensive at first, will grow into value. We are too much inclined to run everything into dollars and cents and If that kind of reduction can not be made, then things are discarded. As well estimate one of the production? of Phidias by the marble there is in it, or the value of one of the pictures of the old masters, by the worth of the canvas. It would be too much like estimating a thoroughbred jersey of the finest strain by the beef she would make. We can not price things that way. As well try and put a cash value on a gorgeous sunset, when the clouds are transformed into glowing mountains of gems as they stand sentinel at the gates of the dj ing day. A SAFE INVESTMENT.

There are mining and smelting stocks offered. Rubber and coffee plantations are promoted which figures results in solid gold. You are invited to invest in coal and oil and in manufactories, war - ranted to bring fabulous dividends. Perhaps you buy and you find your money goes to pay for those alluring advertisements to gull somebody else. Well, look out. Millions every year are thrown away in just such wild-cat schemes. The very best chances for investment are right at home and under your own eyes, where you can watch them. Invest in things which will improve the farm. Utilize the waste places, plant groves and timber belts and ornament your grounds Here is room for cash and care. Take time to lay your plans, plant everything early in the spring, don't wait till stock has leaved out, put things in as soon as the frost is out so they will be rooted when the hot weather comes on. Then take care of them. Cash and cultivation go well together. It is pitiful to see grounds well laid out and planted and left to utter neglect. Weeds make poor companions for ornamentals. It pays to take care of choice things. "Eternal vigilance" is the price of beauty as well as liberty. I Generally the man who leaves his farm to a tenant and moves into n makes a great mistake.

When a man feels he can not do the hard work of former years let him turn his attention to home adornments. It is a fact that as people grow old and near the borders of the Eternal Beauty their attention is drawn out to those things which are most pleasing and attractive. Every year we witness the spectacle of men dropping the harder work for caring for fruits and flowers.

LAYING OUT THE GROUNDS Perhaps you should consult a landscape gardener, perhaps not. know a farmer whose tastes I would consult as soon as I would some who are called experts. Sometimes these things come as a sort of intuition. knew a man in Massachusetts, a blacksmith, who developed such 8j skil for laying out grounds that he was sought for far and wide, and finally became superintendent of one of the cemeteries near Boston. We nee&lt; to avoid monotony. What would suit one man or one place would not be suitable for another. You may already have some fine trees growini which you wish to save and must make your plans conform to them some - what. And right here, let me say, it is utterly impossible to succeed with shrubs and small trees in the neighborhood of large ones. Fix your grounds up as best you may, fertilize your soil, and the big trees will fine it out and will fill the ground with foragers to rob your plants completely You muEt do one of two things: remove the old trees, root and branch, or if you do not want to do this, then dig a ditch three or four feet deep am cut off all those robber roots which invade the ground you wish to plant Fill the ditch up again and then you will have to throw it out and repea the process every two years. A tree is as cunning as a rat, and will go after nourishment when it is anywhere within reach. I have known a large cottonwood or elm to rob several gardens. If the tree is fifty fee tall it will send out its roots 100 feet or over for sustenance. I will give a few hints which will perhaps aid you. When you go into a primeval fores you will often see parks laid out by nature. I recall several such. Tal trees are in the background, then others not quite so high, with shrubber in front, a sort of natural amphitheater, so that standing at the edge, or in the center, you take it all in at a glance. If you carry out this amphl theater plan, then on the outer edge of both sides of your grounds plan your tallest trees, then those of slower growth, next the tallest perennials then those not quite so tall, then gradually come down to the border where you can have the little dwarf iris and the creeping subulata phloxes; then your grass plat with now and then a picea pungen or concolor. Have the front open to the street and all trees on the road so you can look under them and see your friends as they pass, and they can also enjoy your grounds; for you do not plant for yourself exclusively, but also for them There is another system which is entirely different: it is In some measure the English style. The garden is enclosed with a high wall, with </seg>
            <seg id="p224">224 a capping of sharp-pointed rocks to make scaling difficult. It is a system of seclusion. You see something of it in a section of the Shaw Gardens of St. Louis. Shaw was an Englishman and brought this system over with him. An imitation of this plan would be to plant a hedge in front to shut out the view, then fill the yard with shrubbery, through which winding walks would lead you to the house, and the brief walk would give you con - stant surprises; for each spot would be filled with flowers and shrubs tastefully arranged. The house itself would be embowered in vines and overshadowed by trees. Such a plan might work now and then to avoid the monotony, but the open space seems to suit the people best. In plant - ing, it is well to avoid formal rows and plant in groups, putting the tallest in the center to give a mound-like appearance. If a group of splreas, put the opulifolia or tree spirea in the center, for that is the rankest. You might put the golden next, as that is a sport of the former, then Van Houtti, next the Arguta, then Thunbergi aud last Bumalda and Anthony Waterer. If a group of lilacs, put Japonica or Perkinensis in the center, then strong growing ones next, then those of more dwarf habits. In this way you will have mounds of beauty on your grounds. If now and then a limb should stray out too far so as to destroy the symmetry, cut it off. I Perhaps you can not get all the ornamentation you want in front — it ght not be well to have it all there — you might have some at the side or the rear. It is a good thing for the wife, while at work in her kitchen, have some peonies or phloxes smiling at her while she is cooking the iner; it would lighten her burdens and fill her soul with song. By the y, it is well to embellish labor with a little gladness and have a border cheer around the edge of burden. It helps. Let there be some lively (try and not all dull prose.

While you work, and work we must, let your ils be cheered with the unsung and voiceless songs of beauty — those eet, unmetered poems of nature which thrill the soul with pleasure, u can work better if you border your work with flower borders. Busy people need vacations. Many a broken-down woman, for lack of them In time, has had to take a long rest in the hospital, the asylum or the cemetery. This is all wrong; the wife and mother should take a vacation every day where she can visit with the most cheerful, best dressed company on earth. What a refreshment for soul and body the cheer given by thousands of beautiful flowers. BEES IN RELATION TO FLOWERS. tFor what purpose do flowers assume such varied and beautiful color- T Why are certain species strongly scented? The thoughtful person &gt; doubt sometimes puzzled by these questions. The person who doea think probably assumes that they have been provided for his special station. While flowers, on account of their wealth of color, form and </seg>
            <seg id="p225">225 perfume, are certainly a great source of pleasure from youth to old age, it is a mistake to assume that such is the sole purpose of such beauty and variety. The purpose of a plant is the same as the purpose of an animal, namely, the perpetuation of the species and race and to that end the whole of the plant is adapted. tThe usual mode of propagation in the case of flowering plants is by s. Seeds are the result of the fertilization of the female cells of the t by the male cells. The former are called ovules and are generally e in one or more seed chambers bearing a sticky organ known as the na. The male cells are the pollen grains which are developed in the ers borne on the stamens. Before the seed can develop, the ovule t be fertilized by the male cell, and this is brought about, therefore, by transference of the pollen (the male cells) from the anthers to the tie organs, the stigma. The majority of plants have flowers bearing male and female organs, although some plants bear flowers of one In view of these facts, which are necessarily very briefly stated, it will be seen that, in the case of the majority of flowering plants, the perpetua - tion of the species is dependent upon the transference of the pollen to the stigma. It is to this end that plants have developed their great variety of color, form and perfume. It may be asked in what way does all this assist in the propagation of the species. Except in certain species, the flowers cannot fertilize themselves even though both male and female organs exist in the same flower. They have to call in the help of some agent. That agent is most commonly an insect and, of all the insects, the bees are the chief factors in the pollination of flowers. But bees will not visit flowers merely for the pleasure of doing so. They must be at - tracted and consequently they are enticed by the sweet nectar which the flowers secrete in special organs. With this knowledge, how much more interesting are all these things. The flowers flaunt their medley of colors to summon the bees to hidden feasts of nectar; for the color is developed to make the flower attractive. The attractive coloration of flowers re - quiring the assistance of bees in cross-pollination may be compared to the colored berries which attract the birds upon whose services such plants are largely dependent for the distribution of their seeds. In enter- Ing or leaving the flower, the hairy body of the bee is brushed by the anthers and powdered with the contained pollen which it carries to the female stigma of another flower, thereby ensuring cross-fertilisation which increases the production of seed and the vigor of the resulting plants. All this service the bee performs in return for the nectar and surplus pollen which it carries away to store. Space will not permit a consideration of the numerous and bewildering devices which flowers adopt to attract the bees, to prevent their obtaining the nectar without performing their duty of cross-pollination in return, to guide them to the nectaries and to accommodate them while they are partaking of the feast, all of which forms one of the most fascinating of 'studies. Briefly though they be given, the foregoing facts indicate the im - portance and wide relationship which exists between flowers and bass.. </seg>
            <seg id="p226">226 Iien the flowers belong to cultivated plants, whether the plant be alsike apple, the necessity of having as many flowers fertilized as possible is parent. Experiments have shown that in the case of fruit trees three four times as much fruit sets when bees have access to the flowers, and the case of alt ike and white clover, when the bees are prevented from iting the flowers, no seed is produced. It should be necessary to in - t further upon the value of bees in the production of flowers, seed and Some flowers produce more nectar than others and the different quali - ties of honey resulting from different species of plants has already been mentioned. Further, certain plants produce more pollen than others. From the point of view of the bee, the profuse production of pollen by such early-flowering plants as the willows, is a distinct advantage, as pollen is necessary for the rearing of brood. BEES AND FRUIT tin addition to the beneficial relation of bees to fruit trees in the pro - ion of a heavy set of fruit, there are two problems upon which bee - *rs and fruit growers are in danger of entertaining conflicting opinions as they are important, some reference should be made to them. Bee-keepers occasionally suffer losses in the spring by the poisoning of their bees after they have visited fruit trees which have been sprayed while in bloom. Not infrequently the bee-keeper is at first unable to dis - cover the cause of the dying off of the brood and the workers; disease is suspected but no symptoms can be discovered and finally the true cause of the death of the bees is apparent. They have been foraging on fruit blossons which have been sprayed with an arsenical spray. In these cases, the action of the fruit grower is culpable and in certain of the United States, legislation has been passed forbidding the spraying of the fruit trees while they are in bloom. The fruit grower, however, should not re - quire such legislation as the experimental work which has been carried out has shown that the spraying of the trees while they are in bloom is injurious to the blossoms and to spray at such a time is therefore con - trary not only to the interests of the bee-keeper but also to his own. For the codling moth, on which account this application of the arsenical spray is made, the arsenical should be applied after the petals have fallen and within a week of their falling. Fruit growers have complained of the supposed injury to ripe fruit by bees. A few years ago, a series of experiments were carried out in our apiary to discover to what extent bees would injure ripe fruit. It was found, and similar results have been obtained by other investigators, that toes will not injure sound fruit and that they will feed only upon fruit which has already been damaged or injured by some other means. This is an experiment which any fruit grower can confirm for himself. Bees, therefore, eannot be accused of causing injuries to sound fruit. — Ontario Department of Agriculture. </seg>
            <seg id="p227">227 ■ In Minnesota, the Dakotas and all of Nebraska, except the southeast - ern portion, where the winters are as a rule extremely severe and trying, the nurserymen have always been confronted with the problem of pro - ducing hardy apple trees. We are all aware of the fact that in the area named a large percentage of apple trees winterkill during the first severe winter which the young orchard encounters. This is a very discouraging experience to the farmer and orchardist and at the same time gives a bad reputation to the nurseryman who sold the trees. Winter-killing always belongs to either one of two classes. To the first belong those cases where the variety is not absolutely hardy and the tree either kills back in the branches or the entire tree may die. The question is entirely one of variety. For this class of tenderness there is no preventive except not to plant these kinds that are not hardy. In some rare cases the trees may be wrapped or laid down over winter like rasp - berry bushes but this is not practical. The second class of winter-killing is the more common and has nothing to do with the variety. The cause for such winter-killing lies in the fact that the tree has been budded or grafted onto a tender stock or root. The variety may be hardy but if the root upon which it has been worked is tender, the tree will be weakened and winter killed. Such roots may stand the winters for several years and often such trees attain a good old age, but most young trees when they do not yet possess enough roots of their own (that is roots emitted from the scion) will succumb during the first test winter. We call that a test winter when there is a very little or no snow on the ground for a long time and the thermometer goes down to 20 or 30 degrees below zero for a few weeks, then it will suddenly become warm again and then another cold spell. Often late in the winter there is a warm spell and this is followed by a sudden cold snap. Such winters will kill any apple trees that are not ab - solutely hardy in the nursery as well as in the orchard. Whether or not an apple tree of a hardy variety will stand these severe winters all depends upon the method by which the tree was pro - duced and the hardiness of the root upon which it has been worked. In general there are four methods used in producing apple trees in Nebraska and the other Northwestern states. I shall briefly describe these four methods with a short discussion on each method and its relation to the hardiness of the tree. BUDDED TREES. By budded trees we mean those which are produced by budding the desired variety onto a seedling stock. The seedling stocks are either grown or bought. If they are bought we are not certain of their origin nor will we know how hardy they will be. On the other hand, if we grow our own seedlings from seeds that have been taken from such hardy apples as Duchess, Patten's Greening, Hibernal and Virginia Crab and ■ ■ *»# n TicaI f *\ \\ a »■*■! l ha n fr V* a«* «m* U B ♦!*»• + Vi A«r 111 Via Vt n 'mtt ■! at* *1 </seg>
            <seg id="p228">228 liable. Only such seedling stocks will produce trees of certain hardiness Other seedlings whether from France, Vermont or Kansas will nev prove perfectly hardy and should not be used as budding stocks in sue states where the winters are often so severe on our fruit trees. Th reason for these trees not being hardy is this. In budded trees the roo lie almost entirely in the "danger zone," by which I mean the uppermo layer of eoil. I have given this term to the top five or six inches of so where the most severe freezing and the most drying out takes place, also where often a lot of alternate freezing and thawing takes place. In th so-called danger tone the conditions are the most severe and any root th is not perfectly hardy will die if it lies in this zone. This shows ho Most of the roots of a budded tree lie in the danger zone. Sometimes tl wise orchardist will plant his trees 4 to 6 inches deeper than they ha&lt; stood before to get the roots out of the danger zone. By this means lot of winter-killing may be averted. But now if a tree is budded on a hardy stock then the tree will survive even the most severe winters, even though the roots are mostly in this danger zone. The danger zone is really only dangerous to the half hardy or tender root. WHOLE ROOT GRAFT TREES As far as hardiness is concerned whole root graft trees are very sim - ilar to budded trees. If a hardy root is used in producing the tree then the tree will be hardy. But if, on the other hand a tender root is used the tree will succumb during the first test winter for the roots of a whole root graft tree are also mostly in the danger zone. The only real difference in the whole root graft trees and the budded trend lies in the process of pro - ducing the tree, or ennobling it, as the Germans call it (Veredlung). PIECE ROOT GRAFT TREES. tin Minnesota the general method used in producing apple trees is th -scion short-root graft method. This seems to be a kind of graft th developed through necessity. Piece-root grafts were usually abo fifths roots and three-fifths scion, but in the grafts now made tl is are from 6 to 7 inches long and the roots from two to two and on inches. These are then planted so deeply that only the top bud a s above the surface. In this way the root, even though it should 1 er, will come below the danger zone and will not die half as easily as led or whole root graft trees. Figure 3 shows this long-scion-short graft in relation to the danger zone of the soil. I Such grafts will usually throw out roots from the scion and thus th b will gradually get onto its own roots. It Is a great advantage for b to be on its own roots because these roots are just as hardy as see ; roots from this tree. If the tree is of a hardy variety such a tree wi strictly hardy if on its own roots. If such a tree is not on its ow ts then of course the hardiness of the tree will be dependent upon th diness of the root or the depth of the root in the soil. That is if th t is not exactly hardy, it may still survive if the roots have been placed of the danger zone. </seg>
            <seg id="p229">229 In order to encourage a tree to get onto its own roots the best nursery - men often practice a kind of girdling on their grafts. After the grafts are tied the grafter takes his knife and makes a torsional incision around the scion directly above the root, cutting only the bark and not removing any. The Idea is to make the cut around the entire scion but not to connect the cut. The grafts are then tied and packed away. At this incision or girdle a callus will form and when the graft is planted roots will be emitted from this incision. I A different form of piece-root graft is the long scion sidegraft. In king this graft the scion is cut 8 or 9 inches long and the root of two bes is inserted into the side of the scion about two inches up from the t end. This graft is also planted up to the last butt and thus the &gt;t is brought out of the danger zone. In this graft it is also desirable induce roots to grow from the scion by girdling. The scion will also it roots from the butt end below the union and also at the point of on. This is a very desirable kind of graft and should be used If y tender roots are available. DOUBLE WORKED TREES. The best kind of trees to set out in all these northwestern states is the double worked tree. Such trees, however, are not made very often because they are not in demand, nor are they well enough known. Such trees will survive where every other kind of tree will fail. In producing these trees first a long scion-piece root graft is made of some very hardy variety. Hibernal and Virginia Crab are used almost exclusively because these make the best stocks on which to top-graft and at the same time they are of absolute hardiness. After the grafts are made they are also girdled to induce roots from the scion. They are then planted as deeply as possible so they will be on their own roots in a very short time. When two years old they are top-grafted with the desired variety. When the top is one year old or sometimes two the trees are dug in fall and the foreign or stock root is cut off, leaving only the roots that were emitted from the scion. The top is then somewhat cut back and now the tree is ready for sale. Such a tree is well worth twice the price of other trees and persons who know the value of such a tree will be willing to pay more for it. Such trees should also be planted somewhat deeper than they had stood before. Now we have a tree on Hibernal or Virginia Crab roots and trunk which are the acme of hardiness and they do not posses* any undesirable traits. Such trees are immune from root-killing even in the most severe locations and in the most severe winters. Iln conclusion, I wish to say that as soon as there will be a demand double worked trees the nurserymen will be willing to produce them. tTo partly insure a tree against winter-killing it should be planted 4 inches deeper than it had stood in the nursery. This will often save y trees that would otherwise succumb. In many cases winter-killing is really only a kind of drying out of the roots. So if the fall has been a dry one it is often a good plan to irrigate </seg>

MAX PFAENDER, Scotts Bluff County. IMPROVE THE SMALL LOT. Wm. G. McLean, Park Superintendent, Madison, in Wisconsin Horticulture. This short paper is not prepared as a guide for horticulturists setting forth what or how to plant, but ratl.er that it may encourage more of our small holders to improve their surroundings. Burbank Bays, "Environ - ment is the architect of heredity." It is time we should appreciate this, and consider it a privilege to improve our environment. The most neglected spots in every city are to be found on the small lots, and when we stop to consider what a small amount of work would do, and then begin to multiply the benefits, we naturally ask ourselves, why is this? Ken happens that professional people, of exceptional ability, fail their desired goal, simply because they advocate methods too for the understanding and appreciation of the masses. This holds as true with the art of gardening as with other vocations and I find that in general, people don't want too much preaching. What is the use of going into exhaustive details, when usually a simple primary I— op of practical application, will be better understood and really must precede that which is of a higher grade — to teach the professional — les - sons to beginners, will generally tend to scare them out. Every person who improves his grounds, by planting a shrub, tree or flower, is a public benefactor. But why does the work of garden-making languish? Is it because we do not fully realize the many benefits to be derived therefrom, or is it possible that we have been frightened out by some article, written at length, about planting effects, where the writer speaks of the many de - tail considerations, with complex environments, etc., until we are con - fused as to the real purpose. I do not want to belittle the artist, because he is the man to do the large things, and we all know, that to be a real landscape architect, re - quires ability, character and many years of preparation, but give unto Caesar, that which is Caesar's, and I am sure that it is not absolutely accessary to call on the services of an expert, to plant or maintain the average smafl lot, where the building usually occupies two-thirds of the Pirn anxious to encourage this work by proving how simple it is, than by how complex. For example, the Chinaman whom we con - is being uneducated, is nevertheless a good gardener, and then there is the pleasure of learning and improving by experience. Many of our successful farmers have gained their experience right in the field, inside their own fence. A certain good gardener, in Chi- </seg>
            <seg id="p231">231 cago, who happens to be a good friend of mine once consented to teach a young lady the principles of cultivating plants. This lady was very anxious to learn — she had been studying at the university of Chieago — but she came to the conclusion that it would be a great help to re - ceive some instructions from a man who actually made a living by raising plants. This lady was preparing to take care of a large country estate, and to this end she wished to qualify. Lessons were given twice a week, and included nearly everything, from preparing the soil and sowing the seed, to potting, transplanting, cultivating and pruning, but when spring arrived and he requested this young lady to come out into the garden and actually prepare a seedbed, he found that all of his lessons had been of little avail, in so far as their practical application was concerned, — so he began all over again — something like this: "This is a spade, it is a tool used to cultivate the ground, you grasp it by the handle with both hands — so fashion — set the blade upon the ground and with one foot you drive it in. Then by drawing the handle towards you, the soil is pried loose and it is easily tifrned over," etc., etc. All this simply proves how essen - tial the practical lessons are. There are a few general rules to be ob - served, but it is safe to say that nearly all are familiar with these, such as good soil, plenty of sunlight and good cultivation. I might say that cultivation is neglected more than anything else and I would like to sug - gest that this work be done by the children, under the supervision of the parents. The children would be greatly benefited. The next question is what to plant. There is no room upon the small lot for trees, — their place is out on the street, — because, while half a dozen trees may grow well enough in your back yard while they are small, as they grow up it becomes necessary to trim off the side limbs, with the final result, that you have the effect of a yardful of crooked telephone poles. Just plant a few native shrubs, up near the foundation of the house, and possibly a clump in the corner of your lot, or to hide some objection - able view. Keep the lawn open as much as possible, that is, don't dot it all over with plants. If you would add flower beds, place them up against the shrub planting and see what a fine background the shrubs will make. These plants need not be expensive; what would be nicer than a few dog - wood, elderberry or bittersweet, which abound in the woods in this local - ity. All that is needed is the willingness to do a little work. Do not plant for the sole purpose of hiding some old ash pile, but rather clear away the ash heap and plant a few grape vines in its place or any other worthy plant. Ribly I should have mentioned the lawn first, because that which Is asing and refreshing about the home, is of most value, and this credited to a good lawn, well maintained. The following is a sim - ple method of improving the lawn, that may be applied at any time of th« year, when the ground is dry, — known as top dressing. This is a method that has been used successfully in Holland, for many years. From the bottom of the many ditches that convey the water to the pumps in Hol - land, they rake out the marl, which accumulates at the bottom, and allow </seg>
            <seg id="p232">232 I to lie upon the banks over winter. The following spring, this marl is better consistency to handle, and is then spread upon the lawn, abou inch in depth. Upon meadows, where cows are permitted to graze, to months of the year, this treatment is repeated every three years, ant lib way good pastures are maintained for forty years or more, withou eding. I believe that most of our pastures run out in six or eight years It Is a well known fact, that the frosts of winter lift the stools of grass each year, thereby weakening it by exposure. So this top dressing, no only benefits as a fertiliser, but by filling the concaves from one stool to another, it acts as a mulch, encouraging the grass to stool out stronger If the lawn becomes weak or weedy, it needs a treatment of this kind. I is far better to choke out the weeds by a vigorous growth of grass am clover than to dig them out with a knife. You will find that just as soon as the lawn becomes weak, the weeds will get a start. We often see stable manure spread upon the lawn in winter as a means of feeding the lawn, but this is of little or no benefit because the spring rains wash the juice* into the sewer, before the ground underneath ha? had a chance to thaw. It reminds me of giving a man a drink of whiskey when he don' need It. IK good top dressing for this purpose can be made by a body of pre d soil, composed of nine parts of top soil thoroughly mixed with one of well rotted stable manure. This mixture spread over the lawn rubbed in with the back of a rake, will also produce a smoother sur than can be obtained in any other way. If your lawn is weedy, it wil ell to sow a liberal sprinkle of white clover, before applying the top ling This will help to choke out the objectionable weeds, as well as ake a good foundation for the hard usage a lawn often receives. The small lot with its usual pent-up corners, is not an ideal place fo the cultivation of vegetables and yet there are some varieties, such as let tuce, radish and green onions, that do well enough, but the larger varieties •och as tomatoes, cucumbers, melons, corn, cabbage and cauliflower, wi Mad a more free and airy situation. I have mentioned vegetables in con nection with the small lot, because of the great returns realized, for th small amount of labor, properly applied, — and yet it is only good bus ness principle, to recommend a cleaning-up first, in order to provide a fi place for the cultivation of any plant.

SPRAYING MACHINERY— ITS USE AND ABUSE. By George P. Weldon, N. Collins, Colorado. E Spraying is conceded to be one of the most important operations of ard practice. The manner in which it is done very often determines quality of the crop of fruit that is produced. The very best results in spraying are hard to attain with the use of poor machinery. In those sections which are best adapted to the growing of fruit, and where the industry has assumed a stage of great commercial importance, the gasoline power sprayer is much more generally used than any other type of spraying machine. To say that this machine has revolutionised the spraying business, is literally true. Had the orchardists in our fruit sections to depend today on the old-fashioned barrel and tank pumps, manipulated by hand, the high degree of efficiency possible with a modern gasoline power outfit could not be attained. Wherein does the gasoline power sprayer differ from the old type of hand pump so that its use results in greater efficiency? In the first place and probably of more importance than anything else, it is capable of giving a pressure impossible with a hand machine. Any - one who has worked the handle of an old barrel pump hour after hour knows that with its use a pressure of more than 100 pounds is almost out of the question. Our modern gasoline outfits with from two to four leads of hose, will easily maintain a pressure of from 160 to 200 pounds. It is probably true that such a high pressure is not necessary in all cases, but it is true that by means of it more thorough and consequently, more effective work can be done in a much shorter time and with much less effort. Often the small orchard holder can not afford to pay $400 for a good power machine when he can buy a barrel outfit for $20. The latter can be made to do the work well with a greater amount of time and labor expended. There is a tendency in the fruit sections to try to get along with too few machines. There are certain times when spraying must be done immediately if good results are to follow. For example, the period when the first spray for codling moth must be applied to be effective is never much more than ten days, or from the time when the petals drop until the calyces close. Often one machine will be expected to spray a hundred or more acres during that time. Can it be made to do it and do it well? Let us sec: </seg>
            <seg id="p234">234 The average number of apple trees per acre is not less than sixty. Trees that are from 15 to 25 years of age will require at least from ten to twenty gallons of spray per tree if thorough spraying is done. For one acre of trees, putting the average at fifteen gallons per tree, it would take nine hundred gallons of spray, or four and one-half tanks of the ordinary (200 gallon) size. Unless water Is very handy and other conveniences proportionately bo, it is seldom that more than nine tanks can be applied in a day with two leads of hose, and medium coarse nozzles. In other words, only two acres of such orchard can be well sprayed in one day with one power ■prayer. Allowing the maximum time of ten days for the calyces to re - main open, only twenty acres of orchard can be treated with one ma - chine. Yet I know dozens of machines that are expected to spray two and three times as much in a season, and owners of orchards so sprayed condemn the arsenate of lead used, the methods of spraying advocated by those "scientific men," and possibly everything else, except the real rea - son for failure, a desire to make one machine do more than it can possibly accomplish. t Besides the provision for maintenance of a high pressure, there are r things that the power sprayer should possess in order that the est degree of efficiency in spraying may result. The agitation of the liquid in the tank is an important matter. In the case of most of our sprays, the individual particles that make up the Insecticide are suspended in the water. Unless a sprayer is equipped with a good agitator these particles will settle to the bottom, thus render - ing the mixture in the top of tank weaker than it should be, and that in the bottom stronger, possibly in some cases too strong for safe applica - tion. Most of the power sprayers are equipped with suitable agitators, and none should be purchased unless it is known that it is efficient in this respect. It Is needless to say that the care of spraying machinery should never be neglected. The man who pays $400 for an outfit can not well afford to let it stand out over winter where metal parts will rust, where the tank will dry out and deteriorate, if it is a wooden one. Too often gasoline engines are ruined because water is left in the cooling jacket until cold weather comes on. It freezes there and the engine is useless until an - other cylinder is purchased. Much of the trouble with a gasoline power sprayer could be prevented If care were exercised in the fall to clean the outfit thoroughly, to drain the engine, to care for the nozzles, leads of hose, etc. Then, in the spring, another careful overhauling ought to put it in such shape that there should be little trouble during the spraying season. Not only should all this be done, but always after a lime and sulphur or other caustic spray is used, the machine should be thoroughly cleaned by running clear water through it, including hose, rod and nozzles. The •pray will not only injure different parts of the machine, but will also harden and small pieces will clog nozzles when again used. </seg>

The use of hot beds for the starting and growing of vegetables out of season is by no means a practice of recent origin. Two thousand years ago the Romans were growing certain vegetables in pits that were pro - tected by slabs of talc and heated with decaying vegetable matter. The forwarding of young plants for early planting in the garden by the use of hot beds is a practice to be highly recommended for every farm home. A frame of three or four Bash will be of sufficient size to grow all of the plants for transplanting, and will, in addition, furnish quite an amount of radish and lettuce for table use in early spring and late autumn. A home-made frame large enough for four sash need not cost over eight to ten dollars, including the cost of four glazed sash. An outfit of this size carefully managed should afford much pleasure as well as profit. CONSTRUCTION. Location — The ideal location for the hot bed is on the south side of a building or on a southern slope where the cold north and west winds are cut off. It will be a great saving in time to have the bed located near a good water supply, and when possible close to the farm buildings, in order that the plants will receive proper attention as regards ventilating and watering. The bed always extends east and west and should be placed where it will not be shaded during any part of the day. Pit — The depth of the pit varies with the season, kind of plants to be grown, and the heating material used. A common depth is about two feet, and this will answer very well for the borne garden. The width Is almost always six feet and the length as long as desired. If the soil has a tendency to hold moisture it is well to provide artificial drainage by the use of tile or by digging a deep hole in the center of the pit and filling it with stone. Frame — The frame may be constructed of wood, concrete, stone, or brick. The wooden frame, although not bo durable, is much cheaper and will give excellent results. These are made by nailing or bolting together two-inch cypress plank or some other durable wood in the form of a rectangular box, generally six feet wide and of any desirable length. The frame is so made that when the bottom is level, the 'top will be six inches higher on one side than on the other. This provides for the carry - ing away of the rain water and permits the entrance of the sun's rays. After the frame is made it is placed in the pit with the narrow side to - ward the south and nailed or bolted to the two-by-fours which have been Eviously driven along the sides. Then the cross bars made of material inches square are nailed across the frame every three feet to stiffen nd to provide a support for the sash. Covers — Heavy sheeting, canvas, single iight and double light sash are used for covering the beds. The cloth covers are undesirable except </seg>
            <seg id="p236">236 perhaps late in the season, as they will not provide the necessary pro - lection. If the hot bed ie to be started in February, double light sash will prove most satisfactory, and if not until the middle of March light sash may be used. The double light Bash costs from $3 to $4 and the single light sash from $1.50 to $2.50. Heating Material — Fresh horse manure is used for providing the artificial heat. This is gathered at least two weeks before the seed is to be sown, mixed with about one-third its bulk of straw or leaves, and piled up under cover to heat. When it has heated thoroughly it is forked over into another pile, putting what was on the exterior of the old pile into the interior of the new one. After this second heating it is ready for the hot bed pit tit will be found most satisfactory to put the manure into the pit in essive layers of six inches and then tramping it firmly, especially % the sides and corners. Due allowance must be made for settling, after this has taken place the manure should be eighteen inches deep. Soil — Following the manure six inches of rich soil is put in the pit. A good garden soil that does not pack readily may be used, or one can be prepared by piling up alternate layers of June grass sod and manure eight to 'ten months before it will be needed and allowing it to decay. Before this is put in the hot bed it should be put through a coarse sand screen to remove the rough materials. MANAGEMENT. I Sowing Seed — As soon as the manure and soil are in the bed the nab • put on and the heating process begins. In three or four days the tern - ■ature will rise rapidly until it reaches a temperature of 100 degrees brenheit or more. The seed is never sown until after this first heating jver and the temperature has fallen to 85 degrees Fahrenheit. In order be certain about the temperature a good thermometer must be kept in i bed. I The seed are sown preferably in rows across the bed from four to inches apart in order that the soil may be stirred and the plants ned easily. Broadcast sowing is not to be recommended. I Ventilation — The controlling of the temperature is very important must be carefully regulated if good results are to be obtained. The perature is. changed by raising 1 and lowering the sash along the north of the bed. The thermometer is always placed in the shade in the bed when it is read and not in the direct sunlight. Such plants as per, tomato, and egg are held at a day temperature of from 75 to 80 rees Fahrenheit and a night temperature of 65 degrees Fahrenheit, se like lettuce, celery, cabbage, and cauliflower are kept at a tern - iture of 60 to 65 degrees Fahrenheit during the day and 50 to 55 de - ft Fahrenheit at night. t Watering — A good rule to follow in adding water is to water thor - ily but not often. If a little is' added daily it does not reach the !. while at the same time it makes the conditions ideal in the hot bed </seg>

Later in the season on clear, warm days one or possibly even two waterings may be necessary in one day. In cool weather it is well to apply the water In the early forenoon that the plants will be dried off by the heat of the day and the tempera - ture raised before the bed is cooled by the night air. THE SCAB OF APPLES. By Fred W. Cryiler in Fruit Belt. Eit growing is oftentimes seriously interfered with by plant dis - 3 much so that in order to be a successful fruit grower one must general knowledge of their nature, means of perpetuation, mode k, and also how they affect the host. Ew plant diseases are caused by lower plants, very minute, called which prey upon the higher plants, the hosts, interfering with the functions of their parts or destroying them altogether. Fungi are reproduced by spores, which answer the same purpose as seeds do in the higher plants. But the growing injurious part of fungi is known as the mycelium, which, in case of scab, develops beneath the skin of the leaf, twig, or fruit and comes from a little germ tube sent through the tender skin from a spore. Scab is one of the worst diseases of the apple and appears in the spring on the young leaves as slight elevations of a lighter color than the surrounding surface. Soon there appear little tufts of olive colored patches on the leaf surface. These are the fruiting branches of the fungus and at the ends of which spores are borne, which are carried by wind, rain, or some other way to infect other leaves or fruit. In this stage of the disease the function of the leaves is interfered with so that the plant can not get sufficient food required for the time nor for future growth and fruit. In severe cases the leaves become de - formed and fall prematurely, leaving the plant less resistant to future attacks of red and other diseases. But perhaps the most serious effect in a financial way is in the case of the fruit. With this a spore from a diseased leaf alights on the young fruit soon after the flower has fallen, and if the weather is cool and moist the spore germinates' and sends out a little germ tube which forces its way through the tender skin and pro-, ceeds to form a new mycelium and reproduce a new crop of spores. The result is the young tissues of the fruit fail to develop, and the lopsided, deformed, uyi badly cracked apple remains to advertise the willful neglect of the would-be fruit-grower. Scabby apples are worthless for market purposes and of but little use for other purposes. The injury from scab does not stop here, as the rupture* In the skin of the fruit afford a fine entrance for rots, known as bin rots, one of the worst of which is pink rot. This rot gains entrance through the broken skin of the fruit, as it is unable to penetrate unbroken skin, and this condition is furnished by the scab. It develops most rapidly when </seg>
            <seg id="p238">238 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY the scabby fruit is stored in large quantities in sheds, cellars, or piles where asmospheric condltons are damp and close. Here it completes the destruction begun by the scab, and even when fruit attacked by it is shipped it has been known to destroy carload lots in the very few days of transit. t Besides the attack spoken of in the early season, there is another at - t of scab that appears in August, and although this may appear slight result is very severe, as this gives the chance for pink rot to get in later in the season. This attack also furnishes the spores to attack leaves later in the season, so that the disease may be carried over winter and continue the devastation next season. Of course the manner in which winter spores are produced is quite different from the summer form, but the result is the same and all tend to perpetuation of the disease. Prom what has been said it is evident that control must begin in the early spring before the disease has got started again, and in very bad cases spraying should begin before the leaves come out, spraying with a lime sulphur solution or Bordeaux. Give the sprays as recommended in the spray and practice outline of the State Experiment Station, mixing In a generous lot of our own good common sense, and apple scab can be controlled If not completely eradicated from any locality. THE VALUE OF SOME SMALL FRUITS. By David Knight in Fruit Belt. RASPBERRIES Pire is a crop that is not hard to grow or hard to keep in culture af - rted, and the profits to be derived from a patch of either red or raspberries, properly managed, is something enormous. As with strawberries, any land that will grow good corn or potatoes will grow raspberries successfully, but keep in mind that this land must have a good drainage system, either through the sub-soil or by tiling. Black raspber - ries should be set so it is possible to cultivate both ways. The rows should be seven feet apart and the plants from three to three and one - half feet in the row. Set your plants in the spring and cultivate and hoe them about the way you would corn or potatoes. As soon as growth starts and the plants are 18 or 20 inches high, pinch out the top of each cane, which will cause them to send out laterals, thus making a greater capacity for fruit bearing the following year. Along towards fall these laterals will have grown to a considerable length, in a great many cases touching the ground. Now if you wish to grow some plants for your own setting the following spring you should lay these laterals down in the fall as soon as they show a trifle white at the tips, and cover them over with enough earth to hold them in place. The tips thus buried will start a rooting system of their own, and the following spring, as soon as the leaves have commenced to come out a little, cut the laterals off 12 or 15 inches from the stalk and dig your young plants. </seg>
            <seg id="p239">239 Remember that it is always the new growth that produces the fruit, so as soon as the crop is harvested cut out the old canes, thus allowing the new stalks to make a good growth for the following season. A patch of black raspberries, properly trimmed and cultivated, and fertilized as your ground requires, will thrive and produce exceptionally profitable crops for several years. Red raspberries can be set either for hill culture or the hedge row. We prefer the hedge row, and for this system have the rows six feet apart and the plants two feet in the row. If you wish to cultivate both ways set the plants from three to three and one-half feet in the row. The plan to follow for the reds is slightly different from the blacks. No pinching back has to be done in the spring, with the exception of some of the stronger growing varieties, and none whatever in the summer. The Cuthbert, for instance, makes a very rank growth and in the spring should be cut back somewhat, but such varieties as the Eaton and Miller Red should not be cut back, as their growth is not strong enough to warrant this being done. After fruiting, the old cane has to be cut out the same as with black caps, and it is well at this time to trim out some of the weaker stalks, leaving only the stronger ones to produce the crop for the coming season. One thing that should be remembered in the culti - vation of raspberries, as well as blackberries, is to cultivate early, but not too late, for late cultivation will tend to make tender sappy canes that are much more susceptible to frost. CURRANTS. rrhis fruit requires a rich soil and one that is a good retainer of ture. The plants should be set three to four feet apart in the row rows from five to six feet. The patch should be well cultivated and hoed, all weeds being kept down, as they are very injurious of currants. Keep well trimmed after they have come into full bearing, as too much of the young and old wood will hinder the growth. It is not well to allow any of the wood to get very old, as the finest fruit is usually grown on the two and three-year-old growths. Gooseberries require about the same treatment as currants. GRAPES Emsidered from all standpoints this is one of the most satisfactory that can be grown. Almost as sure as the seasons come and go you 1 upon a grape crop. Sometimes larger and sometimes smaller, but they can be classed as a dependable crop, and the average amount that can be made per acre year after year is very satisfactory indeed. And then the harvesting of the fruit and the culture of the vineyard is not such exacting work as with some other fruits, for the picking season extends over a period of two or three weeks, and the pruning of the vines can be done in the late fall or at any time during the winter when there is a day suitable. No plot of ground is too small to have a few vines planted for table use, and it seems that they can not be planted on too large a </seg>

For instance, here at Sawyer and in the vicinity adjacent are located the vineyards of the Lakeside Vineyard Co., comprising over 600 acres of grapes in full bearing. This is the largest vineyard under one management in the state. good dry soil with sufficient drainage is suitable for growing es, if the exposure and climate are favorable. Before planting, plow ow, and pulverize thoroughly down to a depth of twelve or eighteen inches. Plant in row eight to ten feet apart and the plants ten to twelve feet in the rows. There are so many methods of pruning, different methods being adapted to different localities, that we will not dwell on that point only to say that proper pruning is very essential to the suc - cessful growing of grapes, and the method that is proving the best in your locality it the one for you to follow. ASPARAGUS. A great many have made a failure of growing asparagus simply be - cause they have grown it as a side line and have not given it proper at - tention. Asparagus will grow well in most any soil except low, damp ground, but the land must be under good cultivation and free from weeds. Mark the rows off four and one-half feet apart, making the trenches in which the roots are set by plowing twice in the same furrow with a two - horse plow and then shoveling out the loose earth, making a trench about ten inches deep with a smooth flat surface. The plants are now placed in this trench at a distance of twelve to eighteen inches apart, spreading the roots out flat. Then cover with two or three inches of soil, allow - ing the shoots to come up through, and get a foot or so in height before the trench is filled up level. Or, if you wish, while you are hoeing dur - ing the summer to keep the weeds down, you can fill in the trench a little at a time until it is full. After the first good freeze the tops will die down, and should be cut off and burned, after which the bed should have a liberal covering of well rotted manure, or if you do not have that, in the spring you can apply some commercial fertilizer and harrow in well before growth starts. The following year keep religiously at your cultivating and hoeing, allowing no weeds to appear, and in the fall treat the same as the fall previous. The following year you can commence cutting, but you should not do so before, as cutting off the tender succu - lent roots tends to weaken the plant. After you commence cutting keep right at it every day until along into the summer, after which it must be allowed to grow up and mature. By following these directions any one can have a good asparagus bed, and when you get one well established It U a very lucrative part of your farm. THOROUGHNESS IN SPRAYING. By E. H. Lamled, Canton, Ohio. C There has been so much said about the necessity of and profit to be red from spraying and so little about practical methods to follow in the spraying operations that a few suggestions to those who have never </seg>
            <seg id="p241">241 sprayed might prove of inestimable value to them. While it is not my purpose to discuss the relative merits of different makes of spraying machines, since so much of the success of spraying depends upon the efficiency of the sprayer used, I think it advisable to mention some o the essentials of a good spraying machine. To do the "work thoroughly it requires a good pressure of, say, from 90 to 120 pounds in a hand ma chine, and 150 to 200 pounds in a power machine. As most spraying solu - tions are of a caustic and corrosive nature, the pump should have al brmaa working parts, which can be. easily gotten at in case it becomes necessary to take the pump apart to clean or repair it. It should have thorough agitation, be easy to operate, and simply constructed. Righ here I want to say that, contrary to the belief of many, a high pressure machine will not throw the spray or mist more than six to eight fee from the nozzle, as where a mist or fine light spray is formed it can no be thrown very far, owing to the resistance of the air, making the use o extension rod or pipe necessary to do good work. A low pressure ma chine that produces a coarse spray or sprinkle will reach up higher but is of little benefit. A fine vapor spray is what you want. The preparation of the spraying solution should be given careful attention being sure that the chemicals and ingredients are thoroughly dissolved To do this it is absolutely necessary to have separate barrels or casks for preparing your spraying material. Many make the mistake of putting their spraying material into the tank of the sprayer and depend on the agitator of the sprayer to mix and dissolve the ingredients. This is no so bad where a power sprayer is used which has a mechanical agitator which operates very rapidly, but when you attempt to do this with a hand sprayer you can not get satisfactory results, as the agitation is not suffi cient to mix and dissolve the spraying chemicals perfectly, resulting in the spraying material being too strong at one time and too weak at another burning the foliage in the first instance and doing no good in the latter If your trees are infested with any of the scale diseases it is advisable to spray them in the fall or early winter when the temperature is not below the freezing point, with either lime and sulphur or soluble oil. The writer's experience has been that it is best to spray with the soluble oil in the fal or early winter and follow with the lime and sulphur while the trees are still in a dormant condition in the early spring. By doing this you not only control the scale diseases but to a large extent eradicate any fungous dis eases that may be present. If your trees are not infested with scale it Is not necessary to do any spraying while the trees are in a dormant condl tion. but as soon as the petals or blooms begin to fall you should spray thoroughly with arsenate of lead in combination with Bordeaux mixture or a weak solution of lime and sulphur to kill the codling moth and rid your trees of fungous diseases. In this sprayicg especially high pressure Is nec - essary, and the tree should be thoroughly covered so as to be sure of get - ting the poison into the calyx of the forming fruit, so as to kill the cod - ling moth. The writer's observation and experience has been largely with apple trees, and if you will follow the above instructions in spraying your apple orchard the benefit and profit that you will derive from it will sur - prise you. » </seg>
            <seg id="p242">242 DOUBLE CROPPING IN THE ORCHARD. By. Prof. C. G. Woodbury, Purdue University Experiment Station, La- fayette, Indiana. A question of orchard management which is frequently of much con - cern to the fruit grower is the question of double cropping, or the growing of other crops between the fruit trees, especially while they are small and are not using all the ground. This matter, like the question of fillers, is one which depends very largely on the local conditions and on the in - dividuality of the fruit grower. On land which is rough, so that the clean cultivation which would be necessary for the companion crop would be dangerous, double cropping is of course out of the question. On cheap land, some distance from market, double cropping is seldom advisable. This condition is typical of much of the southern Indiana hilly orchard land where a haul of from one to live miles is necessary to the loading station and then a trip by rail. Where the owner is not giving the orchard his close personal attention, but is relying more or less on tenants or em - ployes, it seldom pays to complicate the orchard problem by the introduc - tion of a plan of companion cropping. Any kind of double cropping which involves the use of grain in the orchard is liable to be especially danger - oat to the young trees. There are circumstances, however, where double cropping may not only be not injurious, but where it may be profitable and desirable. Where the ground is rich and nearly level, and where the owner himself is looking after the proposition, farm crops may profitably be grown under certain circumstances for a few years after the trees are •et, and if properly regulated, the trees may not be noticeably injured by the intercropping. The main thing for the owner to remember is that the orchard is the main and the important thing, and that the value of a single crop from a single twenty-five-year-old tree which has been thor - oughly well grown may be worth as much as a thirty-bushel yield of wheat from an acre of ground. Companion or double croppings again, may often be successfully practiced near cities, where the land is too valuable to lie unproductive until the trees produce an income, and where there is a good local demand for the small fruits or market garden produce that may be grown between the young trees, and a good supply of the tran - sient labor needed in harvesting. I Grain crops should be grown very sparingly in the young orchard, e small grains, such as wheat and oats, are especially bad for the trees, 1 remove from the soil the very elements that the trees will later need produce good crops of fruit. If such crops are grown, the plant food y remove should be refunded to the orchard soil in the form of commer - 1 fertilizers, manure, and nitrogenous and humus-supplying cover crops, no case should grain be allowed to grow within six feet of the newly set e. After a year, the space should be enlarged to eight feet, and for the « set two years, a free, cultivated or mulched space of ten feet in diame - should be left. With these precautions, small grains may be grown thout serious Injury to the young trees, for two or three years. Corn is </seg>
            <seg id="p243">HOW TO PROTECT YOITNG TREES. 243 not bo bad as wheat, but it likewise should not be allowed to come within several feet of the young tree. Corn takes from the soil an immense amount of moisture as well as considerable plant food, and hence is especially dangerous to the young tree. A single, well grown tree may be worth several acres of corn, so that it is poor economy to seriously endanger the future welfare of the newly set orchard for one or two crops of grain. t Other crops are better. Potatoes make an excellent crop for the lg orchard. Their cultivation is just what the trees need; they do remove from the soil bo much plant food as the grain crop, and the; e the soil Joose and in excellent condition. Early potatoes especially come off in time to allow the putting in of a cover crop for winter ection. I Market garden crops in general, hoed crops, vegetables and the like the best class of crops for growing in the young orchard. It is seldom the orchard soil is rich enough to be most profitable for the intensive &gt;ping of the gardener, however, and only occasionally that the right 1 conditions as to soil, markets, men, etc., meet to make gardening in young orchard a practicable proposition. The scheme has many gooc gs about it, though, and is sometimes worked out very nicely. I The small fruits are sometimes grown between the trees while the ard is young. Of the small fruits the strawberry is probably better ited for this purpose than any other. It is a low grower, requires cul :ion the first season, is mulched during the winter (the mulch having tically the same effect in the orchard as a good cover crop wouk 0 ; the bed runs out in a couple of years or so, and so is likely to be of the way by the time the trees need the soil, and altogether has y factors to commend it. Sometimes the bush fruits are grown in the lg orchard. The plan can be made successful with the right local con ins, and above all with the right man to run It, but is not to be espe - y recommended as a general proposition. HOW TO PROTECT YOUNG TREES. By 0. K. White. College Extension Horticulturist of Michigan Agricultural College. I Very often when spring approaches and the snow goes away, fruit rers find many of their young trees have been seriously injured — the : has been gnawed off the trunk half, two-thirds, or entirely around, may have been done by mice, rabbits, muskrats. or some other nts. Such injuries usually occur during long, hard winters, when snow is unusually deep and the animals have difficulty In finding ty of food, and they fall upon the bark of theae trees as a last re - to satisfy their appetites. A great many young orchards have been planted in the last few years adjacent to wood lots or cut over lands where rabbits abound. Others have been allowed to grow up to grass and weeds, where mice may have become numerous; and others have been planted near swamps or </seg>

If the winter should be long and severe and the snow deep hundreds of these trees are liable to be partially or wholly girdled before spring. If this injury is to be avoided fall is the time to do it. There are several different kinds of material used to Eect the bark of young trees from such creatures, such as tar paper, d Teneer, wire mosquito netting, galvanized wire netting (four hes to the inch), wire coils and pieces of cornstalks. All have their Its and defects. The wood veneer or tar paper protectors can be secured in large quantities at from three.quartes to a cent apiece, and they are very good. They not only protect the trees from the mice, rabbits, etc., but they also protect the trunk of the trees from sun and cold, and this is a serious trouble on south or southwestern slopes, especially in Northern Michigan. These should be removed in the spring, however, as they often harbor insects and fungi, which may do harm to the bark. If left on all summer they may also shade the trunk enough to make the bark tender and more liable to winter freezing or attacks of fungous diseases. The wire mosquito netting or galvanized wire netting protectors are more expensive, costing about 3 cents apiece when bought by the roll and cut up at home. They can be secured in various widths, from a foot and a half up to suit conditions, but this is largely overcome by their durability and effectiveness. They have all of the merits of the wood veneer or tar paper and do not make the bark tender or harbor the injurious Insects and fungi. It would hardly seem possible for them to prevent sun scald, but they seem to diffuse the sun's rays so that they do no harm on warm January and February days. The butts of cornstalks may be used if no other material can be secured, but they do not last long and are difficult to bind on. Pn putting on the tar paper or veneer fine wire or strong, durable S should be used, one near the bottom and one near the top, ed that they run through a notch or hole so that they will not „ down and the protector fall over and blow away. Wood veneer protectors must also be soaked in water to prevent their cracking when being put on. The wire netting protection may be put on with wire bands or wire hooks such as hog nose rings or something simi - lar, and then they can be easily put on and taken off. In many cases it would be well to mound up the ground slightly around the trees and then push the tree protector into this mound a little to help hold It (Irmly in place. Many orchardists may think these protectors are a nuisance and expense, but often they save trees worth many times the </seg>

E grading and packing of fruit is the most important part of the the fruit industry and covers more ground than just preparing for market, when it is in the proper condition to do so. tit our fruit trees have been given the right attention before and ig the growing season, we will have eliminated, to a great extent, work of grading the fruit at the time of packing. With the apple, if we have neglected to cultivate, prune, thin or spray, more especially the latter, we can safely count on a large per cent of culls and No. S and a very small per cent of No. 1 fruit. I have seen an orchard that has a good crop of fruit as to quantity but it had not been sprayed and did not have a No. 1 apple in it, so in this case there was no grading nor packing to be done. This lot of fruit went on the market in balk and brought a low price, probably all that it was worth. My first experience in packing apples was more than fifty yean ago; since that time I have had more or less of it to do down to the present season. In some respects there has been quite an improve - ment in the manner of packing and grading fruit The first apples I remember of helping to pack, the buyer furnished second hand flour barrels, also salt barrels, or any old one that would bold three bushels or more. We packed them as is done at the present time, putting in all sound, picked fruit. There were but a few wormy apples and no scab. For a press we used a lever, as there was not any screw press on the market then. At the present time our manner of grading and packing apples is, when the season for that work arrives, first to have our supply of barrels on hand with hoops nailed and face end of barrels lined. We usually commence picking one day in advance of packing, beginning with those trees where the fruit is thin and scat - tering, and haul to a central or convenient place in the orchard, where it is to be graded and packed. The next day we commence to grade and pack. For a sorting table we use one made of canvas about eight or ten feet long, the fruit is poured onto this table, and the sorters on each side of it sort and move the fruit along to the man who places it in the barrel. This man should be the best and quickest on the job, for he must see that the barrel is properly faced, shaken, and that no faulty fruit goes into it that may have passed by the sorters. After it is filled and well shaken, it is then moved out to the header, who must use his judgment as to just how full it should be, as some varieties will stand and require more pressure than others. After the work of the header is done, the barrel is rolled out of the way and sometime during the day all filled barrels are hauled to a car or placed under shelter. We do not allow our barrels to lie out to the weather either before or after packing. We stamp on the face end of each barrel our name and address, also the variety of apple It contains. </seg>
            <seg id="p246">246 At our home market when we sell to the retailer and consumer, co matter whether it Is apples, pears, peaches, or berries, and in whatever kind of package or measure used, we guarantee the fruit to be the same all the way through as on top. I do not think the average way of facing a barrel of apples is the right way. The facing should give a fair representation of the fruit within both as to size and color, and then the buyer would know just what he was getting and not be so badly disappointed as he is many times by bad packing, which hurts the sale of the fruit For packing peaches we use the four basket crate, Climax basket, also bushel box and basket. I do not like the four-basket crate for several reasons: First, it does not as a rule bring more than one - half as much as a six-basket crate does, and, further, when the peaches are large two tiers of fruit can not be gotten in without raising the cover with strips, and this gives the crate a bad appearance. I have found by experience In making express shipments that the package is easily robbed by some one while on its way to the receiver or com - mission man. We pick our peaches when they are just ripe enough to be in good condition fdr use when they reach the consumer. We do not have much grading to do with the peach. No green nor over, ripe fruit must go into the package. It usually takes from ten to twelve days to gather each variety for market. For packing pears we use bushel boxes and baskets, also barrels. All fruit of fair size and sound condition goes in. I have shipped several cars of pears in bulk and have had fair results. For our home market we make several grades, as some want culls and medium quality, while others want the largest and best We find our greatest profit In fruit is when we sell to the retailer and consumer and at prices according to grade. ON CROSS-POLLINATION. HOW CROSS-POLLINATION AIDS IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION OF A FRUIT CROP. In his paper on cross-pollination read before the Virginia State Horticultural Society, January 11, 1912, Henry M. Dunlap, of Illinois, said: "Cross-pollination of plants for the purpose of securing a variety from the seed so influenced, has been practiced for many years. Darwin's re- Marches along this line and also in the animal kingdom were published a half century ago. Many state and private experiment stations are at work brawling new varieties in both the plant and animal kingdom' that shall combine the best characteristics of both parents. "The cross-pollination of which I write is of a different nature, or rather has reference to entirely different results. It has nothing to do with perpetuation of the variety through its seeds, but has to do with the fruit development and the production of a crop, so far as this discussion </seg>
            <seg id="p247">CBOSS-POLLINATION. 247 "In the early seventies of the last century Mr. D. B. Wier of Lacon, Illinois, called the attention of his fellow fruit growers to the fact that: "PLUMS OF SEVERAL VARIETIES rming at the same period produced better crops when planted in the ediate vicinity of each other and called attention to the fact that when planted separately a fruit crop was harvested only when the. conditions were extremely favorable. These statements were productive of con - siderable discussion and it was the conclusion that the best results with plums were obtained by mixed planting of varieties. "WITH STRAWBERRIES, ALSO the fact was early noted, that some varieties were self-fertile, others partly self-pollenizing, while other varieties were self-sterile, requiring the planting of a staminate variety with them if any result in the way of fruit was to be obtained. You are familiar with these facts and it is un - necessary to go further into detail regarding them. I believe it Is gen - erally conceded now in strawberry culture that the best crop results are obtained by mixed planting, that is by planting so as to alternate in separate rows strong pollenizers with those not so strong in this respect rough considered self-fertile, and as also good in furnishing pollen pistillate sorts. "In a general way the apple is supposed to be self-fertile. It has been known among experts that certain varieties were not as strong in pollen as certain other varieties, but until recently it has not been thought necessary to take into consideration in the planting of applet orchards that apple trees would be more productive where cross-pollina - tion is provided for. "As many as twenty years ago, and perhaps longer ago than that, some planters alternately planted an upright grower with a spreading top, either alternating in the row or in separate rows, but this was for econ - omy of room rather than for pollenizing purposes. "COMMERCIAL ORCHARDS. "Some eighteen or twenty years ago the planting of commercial apple orchards in Illinois and Missouri had a great boom. For several years prior to that time, small farm orchards in those sections consisting of a number of varieties as such orchards have borne enormous crops that paid the owners fabulous sums of money. The Ben Davis, then a new variety for that section, proved to be so well adapted to that section that it outbore and outshone all the others. The result was that hun - dreds of acres in Southern Illinois and Missouri were planted to apples and of these 75 per cent were Ben Davis. "Not having cross-pollination of varieties in mind and in reality know - ing nothing of such things, the greater number of these orchards were planted in solid blocks, the varieties in their order of importance ranking </seg>
            <seg id="p248">248 about u follows: Ben Davis, Jonathan, Rome Beauty, Wlnesap, Maiden Blush, Gano and Huntsman. A few other scattering sorts were planted but not in a general way. The selection of varieties was good, and could not be greatly improved upon for that section at the present day except to add Grimes Golden; but the proportion In which they were planted can be Improved upon. "THE GREAT MISTAKE was In solid block plantings and the excessive amount of Ben Davis. In some Instances such blocks of- Ben Davis amounted to forty or* even as high as sixty acres of that variety alone. "In 1901 the Illinois Orchard Company, of which the writer is presi - dent and manager, was organized for the purpose of operating in apple growing, and that year some three hundred acres of land, mostly planted fcchards, were purchased in the counties of Clay and Richland in this lent Illinois section referred to. While preference was given to orch - ards containing a number of varieties, no significance was attached to the matter of cross-pollination as a factor in the production of crops and one orchard of eighty acres was purchased which contained a block of sixty acres all in Ben Davis. "During the paet ten years those orchards of the company where there was a reasonable amount of mixed planting have produced a pay - ing crop eight years out of the ten. While no exact record has been kept regarding the solid blocks of Ben Davis it is safe to say that they have not produced more than four paying crops out of the ten referred to above. The failures were due in some instances to spring frosts and in others to excessive rains during blooming time or to continued cold and rain combined. When the conditions were normal or favorable at the time of blooming there was no material difference in the amount of fruit buds set on the solid as against the mixed plats and the results were equally satisfactory in both. "During the so-called off years or those where the weather conditions were bad, cold rain or frost, or all of them, the setting of fruit was no - ticeably greater on those rows along the lines of clearage between the several varieties in the orchard, shading off to nothing in the solid blocks when the conditions were very bad. In one forty-acre orchard planted to Jonathan and Ben Davis in the proportion of eight rows of Ben Davis to one row of Jonathan the conditions have been very marked indeed. During some of the off years the Jonathan row has been full of fruit while the Ben Davis row immediately next to the Jonathan row was reasonably full; the second row removed about half as much while the third and fourth rows were without any fruit Other orchards pro - duced like results. "Other things are essential besides cross-pollination, such as spraying, cultivation, and pruning, but without proper planting to secure cross-pol - lination of one variety by another I would not expect the best of suc - cess where the weather conditions are liable to enter into the proper 1 entitling of the bloom and the setting of the buds. </seg>
            <seg id="p249">CBOW POLLl NATION. 249 "This statement is made, based upon a lifetime of observation and experience. My father was a fruit grower and in 1860-1863 set out orchards on his farm in Champaign County, Illinois, of over 100 acres in extent. These orchards consisted of many varieties, hardly any two adjoining rows being of the same variety, thus the matter of cross-pol - lination was given full sway. The orchard was set in this manner to test out the many varieties then before the grower, to determine value and adaptability to the then new prairies of Illinois. I do not remember a single failure In this orchard until the year 1893, which was due to a severe freeie. "MY CONCLUSIONS ARES That with apple buds self-pollinated they are not so strong, and they do not possess the vitality possessed by buds that are fertilized by the pollen from some other variety. All of the trees of any certain variety are the same as one tree. Separate trees of Ben Davis for example, although in - dividual trees, are from the same original bud and constitute but one tree, or individual. They are the product of grafting or budding, and are essentially a part of and identically the same as the tree from which they sprang. "Varieties originate from the seed 1 and each tree so originated is of a different kind no two being alike, in either tree or fruit It is a well known fact that seeds from the same apple produce entirely different progeny, some may produce sweet fruit and others sour fruit. "Darwin demonstrated that animals too closely related produce weaker offspring than those not related. Nature is so constituted that the same laws prevail in the vegetable as in the animal kingdom, with Klflcation of course, so that the cross-pollination of one variety by a rent variety is a demand and law of nature that we should heed. "ALTERNATE FOUR-ROW BLOCKS. "To secure the best results, plant your apple orchard so that not more than four rows of the same variety are together. It is now my prac - tice and has been for several years to plant four rows of one variety alternating with four rows of another variety. For example in setting fifty acres of Jonathan and fifty acres of Grimes in 1907 I alternated four rows of Grimes with four rows of Jonathan throughout the one hundred - acres. By so doing I also had in mind the harvesting of the fruit in the most economical manner. It sometimes happens that the windfalls are of value if harvested separately and this is best secured by the four row system. The picking of the fruit at harvest time is also best conserved Es method of planting is followed. I would not alternate in the same unless it were intended to remove the fillers, on account of the an - ace of keeping the varieties separate. "TO SECURE CROSS-POLLINATION In an orchard already planted to the block system there are two methods or a combination of the two dependent upon conditions. </seg>
            <seg id="p250">250 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. "First, all vacancies in any orchard may be filled with trees of an - other variety that blooms at the same period as the variety to be pollen - lied. If the vacancies are sufficiently numerous this is all that is re - quired. If not, then enough of the trees should be top-grafted with a suitable variety to accomplish the purpose. In place of working an en - tire row a good way to secure the desired effect is to top-work or graft one tree in every nine. That is, beginning with the second row and the second tree in the second row of a block, top-graft that tree and every rtree in that row, and every third tree in every third row thereafter, u will lay out a block of thirty-six trees, six trees each way in a square, and put a circle around each tree to be top-worked, you will dis - cover that each tree so worked will be in the center of a little square of t trees. In other words, all trees in the block adjoin a tree of another ty diagonally or at right angles." ABOUT PEDIGREED TREES. We have just now a period of great agitation in the business of apple growing. This agitation is directed towards its increase and improve - ment All over the country from ocean to ocean new orchards are being planted and old and hitherto neglected ones are getting such an over - hauling as never befell them in former times. There is little doubt that the next ten years will see a most remarkable transformation of apple growing especially in that part of the country lying east of the great plains. To the west of this division the new era is already established, but even here there may be yet great progress. Everywhere the growers are demanding to know the best methods; they want to know how to grow the best possible quality of fruit, to know the best methods of cultivation, spraying, pruning and marketing. In es - tablishing their many new orchards they want the better quality varieties and they want the best trees that the nurseryman is able to supply. This last has doubtless contributed largely to the practice that seems to be increasing of growing so-called "pedigreed" trees. The common method of growing such trees seems to consist of propagating from individual bearing trees of known excellence, as distinguished from the more usual practice of the nurserymen of cutting his propagating wood from young trees in his nursery rows. INDIVIDUALITY WITHIN THE TREE. Piw, the fact that individual trees in the orchard differ greatly in the it of fruit produced and also show pronounced differences in form, and quality is one that cannot be denied; and the differences, es - pecially in productiveness, are greater than many orchardists suppose. Furthermore it does not seem reasonable in many cases, to attribute these variations to differences of soil, exposure or any other environmental in - fluences, though such influences do greatly affect all varieties, of course. There are Individual differences that proceed from within and not from </seg>
            <seg id="p251">" EXtLAMJ tr nU H 1 -&gt;tj. 251 without If these may be transmitted through the bud or scion to other trees the practice of propagating from trees of known excellence is a most reasonable one and ought to be encouraged in all possible ways; on the other hand if we can not hope to so transmit them the practice is a waste of time and effort, and can result in nothing but disappointment and dis - couragement to the grower who plants them. There are a number of cases on record where a portion of a tree had borne apples strikingly different from the rest of the tree and these variations have been successfully reproduced by bud. If superior - ity appearing in a portion of a tree may be reproduced it may seem most reasonable to suppose that the same result is to be expected if the whole tree is superior. But the differences here referred to are striking ones generally spoken of as "bud sports" and are believed to be of rare occur - rence though we do not know just how unusual they may be. Beyond doubt the general opinion is that they are most uncommon and are of a different nature from the ordinary variations that give us the usual especially desirable tree, and which are the ones commonly sought for by the grower of "pedigreed" trees. WHERE IS THE PROOF? Eire seems to be a general feeling, however, among a great many that these individual variations, not "bud sports," may In some at least, be reproduced by buds. I do not know of any reliable proof that this is the case. The presumption seem* to be that any at - tempt to transmit the excellence of an individual tree Is likely to be of no avail and to yield only disappointment to the grower who propagates such trees. This is by no means a proven fact, for while certain attempts to reproduce such variations have apparently resulted in failure it re - quires a great many such negative results to demonstrate in a satisfactory manner that the case is hopeless. Others claim to have been successful in such efforts, but so far as these cases have come to the notice of the writer they seem to be sus - ceptible to a different explanation. It would be interesting to know more of the efforts of those who have tried to transmit individual excellence by bud. It is probable that many experiments have been made that have not come to any public notice. What have been their methods of selec - tion and propagation, what success or failure has attended these efforts? Massachusetts. J. K. SHAW. OPEN-HEAD PRUNING. B:&lt;or some time the writer has been desirous of giving his ideas and rience on pruning, but has refrained from doing so for lack of au - tative approval of his methods. This obstacle has been removed, however, by two papers from very able experts oi other states before our State Horticultural Society at Harrisonburg this winter, who approved practically in detail the method herein set forth. </seg>
            <seg id="p252">252 m My object Is sot to improve on these papers, but rather to confirm them with reference to our own local conditions, and my own personal experience. tThe average orchard as we find it today is not trained in a form to tduce the best and most economical results, either as to the amount fruit produced or as to the best quality. In the first place the trees in our older orchards are in most cases headed too high. It is not usually advisable to change this however. Secondly, they are allowed to grow too tall to be profitably worked. The height of the trees can be reduced and the method of pruning greatly improved upon. The errors as we find them are mainly two: On the one hand the tops have been allowed to grow too thick from an almost total lack of pruning. On the other hand they are often thinned out too much, forcing the fruiting wood near the ends of the branches toward the top* of the trees. The result of either method is equally pernicious. OPEN-HEAD PRUNING. I Those who have had experience generally recognize the fact that if ! tops are more than 15 to 20 feet high the trees cannot be sprayed r the fruit handled to the best advantage. Tbis method has brought &gt;ut the introduction of the open-head method of pruning now practiced the new orchards of the West, and of which we now wish to speak, :h reference to the old orchards of the East As a result of this form pruning we have the cut-back orchard, or as Mr. Drew says, we prune ira those trees which other people have pruned up. Most onhardists and some horticulturists do not advocate the cut - ting down of high trees on theoretical grounds. They do not believe that the wounds will heal or that the desired results can be obtained. We know now by actual experience that these objections have been over - come with perfectly satisfactory results, even outstripping our highest expectations. I It is hard to lay down an exact rule for cutting as the types of tree* y somewhat, but In all cases if the tree be too high to be economically ked it should be lowered by removing the central or vertical branches the crotch, or as near the crotch as possible. With trees of upright wth like the Newtown, the resulting form resembles an inverted um - lla, when the tree is dormant. When the tree is loaded with fruit remaining branches bend down assuming the graceful drooping form, much sought after by the man who grows the fancy box fruit. In ling with trees like the winesap, the principle is the same, but the n of cutting should be varied slightly from that employed with the re upright and closer growing varieties. Sometimes, for example. Lead of removing a central or upright shaft from the tree, the removal &gt;ne or two Bide branches which have been allowed to grow too high, I reduce the tree to the desired form. The practical orchardist needs only to be reminded merely that the two or three-story tree can be lowered to the basement without evil re- </seg>
            <seg id="p253">OPEN-HEAD Pi; 253 suits, and he will soon master the correct method of accomplishment The following general rule, however, may be laid down for cutting. HOW TO CUT. tAa Mr. Surface says, "get into your mind first the form which the should assume two or three years hence, and then cut to produce that result," by removing all upright branches to the crotch or to a suit - able feeder at least one-third the size of the limb removed, which, if loaded with fruit would remain rigid. Thus we tend to produce the open head or inverted umbrella form. As much as possible the cutting should be done on the inside of the tree, so as to push out the side branches to broaden the top. Never remove a fruit spur or small limb from near the crotch of the tree without special reason, as it may bear fruit, and unless it assumes the form of a water-sucker, it can not possibly do any harm. Those who practice this form of pruning deserve to be characterized as "tree butchers." « • r ff ••*! Now, when the tree is loaded with fruit the branches droop grace - fully in all directions, and the bottom layer or limbs nearest to the ground should, if possible, touch the ground at the tips, acting as a sap - port for Itself, and also for the limbs above, thus dispensing with arti - ficial supports. As stated above, the theoretical objection most often advanced adverse to this method is one of the skepticism, about non-healing, sun-scald, etc., all of which are proven by actual practice to be unfounded and false theories, and the writer challenges an example to the contrary. After having had several years' experience in cutting trees of all ages and con - ditions by this method, and also in top-working (cleft grafting) old trees, we have yet to see a single example of permanent injury from cutting, when subsequently the trees are properly nourished, even when a wood preservative be not used. Faint or coal tar may be used for this par - pose if you feel that it is safer, but you will in all probability dispense with this, except for very old and decrepit trees, after a few years' ex - perience. So far as the writer Is aware there is not a single disadvantage to this method of pruning, while the advantages are many and manifest. 1. The primary object is attained by bringing the trees down where they can be handled economically. 2. In addition to this they will bear a great deal more fruit per bear - ing surface. The reason for which is explained thus: a. The central top of the tree, If left intact, tends to assume the nature of a water-sucker which draws on the remaining branches, bat when the top is removed we have the opposite effect; that Is, we throw the strength to the side branches where most of the fruit spurs are borne. b. Again, the sunlight is allowed to penetrate to the center of the tree in a* more effective way than is possible with the close top, thereby making it feasible to grow the fruiting wood much more thickly. To have this thickly-growing, bearing wood Is especially valuable If yon wish </seg>
            <seg id="p254">254 to crow a high percentage of fancy fruit, and at the same time grow quantity. This is valuable for the following reasons: Suppose your tree baa been pruned by the old-fashioned close-head and thin-out method, which forces the bearing wood toward the ends of the branches. As a result you have clusters of apples on the same fruit spur or twig, which makes it Impossible to grow first-class fruit because of the law of survival of the fittest, and because of the natural harbor made thereby for the codling moth and for the lesser apple worm, etc. Is it not then infinitely better to have an added number of fruit spurs and bearing twigs, and have fruit singly borne? Perhaps you may grasp the philosophy of my statement more clearly when I say that it Is better to have a single apple on each of five twigs or disconnected fruit spurs, than to have five apples all growing on one twig or spur, when four of the five must be removed by thinning before you can grow a very high percentage of first-class fruit. Do you gather my meaning, when I say that it Is better to grow five boxes of first-class fruit on a tree by proper dissemination of the fruiting wood, than to grow one box near the tips of the limbs, and the tops of the trees at the same cost? REMOVAL OF TOPS MAKES FRUIT 3. Still a third advantage, and one which is contrary to horticultural lore, is this: It has been usually conceeded that winter pruning ten to produce wood, and summer pruning to produce fruit. But the writ has In two or three instances demonstrated that the removal of the to from thriftily growing trees, ten to twenty years of age, in the dorman period tends to fruit them sooner and more abundantly than could othe wise be expected in three or four more years by the close-head metho&lt; The reason for this it manifest, as the removal of the sappy and rapid crowing top gives the tree a temporary check of growth and also throw added strength to the fruit buds on the remaining branches, which caus a profusion of buds to set fruit. During the past three years that we have been using this method of pruning trees here in Albemarle County we have observed the following (acts with reference to the regard in which our method is held by our neighboring orcharding. A few have adopted our method at sight with - out waiting to see the outcome, others have attempted to approximate to the open-head method. Instead of cutting out the centers to the crotch or to a suitable feeder they simply cut off a foot or two of the tips of the longer limbs. The result is quite evident if you will stop to think what must take place two or three years in the future. As a precaution, I would suggest at this point that if you can not be practically certain what the future will bring forth you would better for the sake of the welfare of the orchard try it on a small scale at first and await developments. For, when the tips are cut off in this way, the ultimate result is a com - pound head for every limb that is cut, .and after three or four years' growth you have a top so thick and high headed that the only remedy is to entirely rehead the trees at the crotch. </seg>
            <seg id="p255">STRAWBERRY CULTURE. 255 4. A further advantage of this form of top is found In the rnft tendency to grow for quality rather than for quantity of fruit, necessitat - ing thinning, a process which is well-nigh impossible and certainly, to say the least, laborious on high and close-headed trees, while on the other hand with the modern open-head tree it is a comparatively easy process to thin as well as to gather the fruit Those who attended the meeting of our horticultural society this season will recall that these sayings were approved, at least, in principle, by Messrs. Surface of Pennsylvania, and Drew of Connecticut, recording their experiences in their respective states. This last, both in justice to these men of eminence and because "a prophet is not without honor save in his own country." E3. F. COL£. Virginia. In Fruit Grower. STRAWBERRY CULTURE. The market wants your early berries, not only in car lots, but train - load lots, and will pay you a good price to get them if they possess the desired quality; but will not accept inferior fruit in such quantities at a price which will Justify you in growing it. The difference between E'ng, say, one thousand bushels of strictly fancy berries and the com - berries is not so great as you may imagine. The express charges, rer, are just the same on both lots. There must be a change in the method of growing berries as well as a better understanding of the laws of nature in plant life which govern the development of fruit. Many of us are setting and cultivating too many acres for the amount of fruit we are getting. We must concen - trate our efforts on fewer acres; fertilize better; cultivate better and Kgate our plants in such a manner that they will respond to better &gt; by devoting their energies to the development of fruit instead of The assumption that one plant is just as good as "another for the purpose of propagation is no more true than that one animal of a certain breed is just as good as any other. It does make a difference as to how they are bred to develop good qualities. Strawberry plants propa - gate themselves sexually, or by seeds, and asexually, or by runners. When grown from seeds they receive two parental impressions just the same as an animal, and may take a greater impression from one parent than the other. Because of this we can never be sure of the kind of fruit or foliage we are going to get. Not one seedling in ten thousand will equal our standard varieties, because the latter have been culled from hundreds of thousands of seedlings, or found by chance in some out-of-the - way place where the seed happened to fall. All fruits — thai is the flesh — grows as a substance for seeds to develop in, and whenever the seeds are wanting there will be no fruit, or it will be badly deformed. Some one has prophesied that we would soon have seedless berries because the banana and some oranges and other fruits grow without </seg>

These bare been propagated asexually, or by buds, so long that they have lost their habit of seed formation or are only freaks, but they serve to prove the argument that I have long advanced that fruitfulness could be largely increased or decreased by good or bad propagation. No one has ever yet sepn a large, luscious strawberry unless the potency of pollen was strong and healthful as well as the pistil and receiving fluid of stigma. LET THE PLANTS BEAR. The passion of the plants to breed by seeds (which are only the plant's eggs) U as strong as that of any animal and if not held under restriction by pruning they breed themselves into impotency in an in - credibly short time, and this is especially true of strawberries. It will not do to remove blossoms year after year and never allow plants to fruit, because it is well understood that whether in plant life or animal life a physical power never exercised will soon be lost. They must be allowed to develop berries to strengthen their ability in this direction, but must no more be r Mowed to fruit to excess than you would allow a valuable stock animal to breed excessively. I speak now of the plant for purposes of propagation. When a plant becomes exhausted it then multiplies its species by pro - ducing runners. Sometimes such plants produce bloom in great profu - sion, but at harvest the berries are deformed, small and have many blanks. We cannot cut an animal in pieces and grow several animals from him, because he contains only one indivisable life germ, while the tree and plant is not only an individual as a whole, but the protoplasm, as that material in which the principle of life resides, is found in all the nodes and internodes of the branches and often the roots of the tree. And it is for this reason we are able to propagate by runners, cuttings, L Plants propagated in this way are children of one parent, and recelv - but one impress they bear fruit, as a rule very closely resembling the plant from which they were taken, and yet when placed under changed conditions the greatest variations often take place. Variation is one of the great laws of nature. No two blades of grass or anything else ever grew which were exactly alike. Sometimes these bud variations are so great as to constitute entirely new varieties. In floriculture the number of new varieties produced in this way is very large and cases in fruit go well up into the hundreds and will become more numerous when fruit growers understand and begin to look out for them. PROPAGATION FROM CROWDED BEDS. We often' find a branch of an apple tree bearing fruit differing widely from other branches, and this may be increased by propagating from that branch. So in this way we may greatly improve varieties by continuously propagating from perfect plants and those which vary in the right direc - tion. Every fruit grower should be constantly on the lookout for such </seg>
            <seg id="p257">STRAWBERRY CULTURE. tk plants, and when found a part of the bloom should be removed to prevent exhaustion, and the fruiting yield constantly renewed from these per - fect and vigorous plants. The present custom of taking strawberry plants from alongside of the wide matted row is very bad. It should never be done. These plants are often the last to form In the fall and they have immature roots and their fruit buds are not fully developed. The roots being immature and standing alone without protection from the foliage of other plants the frost weakens the roots so that they perish upon be - ing transplanted. Strawberries lose their habit of fruiting by being propa - gated from densely crowded beds. Experiment shows that strong fruit buds will not form where the sun does not shine on the crown. We no - tice that the foliage of an isolated plant droops in all directions, fully exposing its crown to the light. A plant cannot assimilate its food ex - cept its leaves are exposed to the sunlight, and as the substance which forms the fruit must all first go to the leaves to be digested, this can not be accomplished in even moderate shade. Plants also lose their fruit bud forming habit by being propagated on land especially rich in nitro - gen, and on low land with quicksand subsoil, which keeps the water near the surface. Such plants become vlney, and while they will form mil - lions of plants to the acre, yet when transplanted to the fruiting field they carry this habit with them, and instead of berries yon get only runners. For these reasons the wide matted row must be abandoned by all who expect to grow strictly fancy fruit Each plant must have Its own room, sunlight and root pasturage. In the wide matted row the plants are struggling for existence, and constantly warring on each other. Th surplus plants not only "pump" the water out of the ground, but a crus forms and excludes the air from the roots. But as the capillary passages are perfect, in this packed soil, the water is drawn to the surface, carrle off by the sun and wind and the ground dried out with great rapidity The usual spring drouth, prevailing at about the time berries begin to rip - en, often greatly reduces the size of the berries. GROWING IN HILLS. §The ideal way of growing berries is strictly in hills or stools. In this all runners are kept cut off as fast as they appear. If the plant is in fruit-forming vigor when a runner is cut, a new fruit bud and crown will form; the roots will increase and force their way farther down and spread out in search of food until the plants attain a wonderful size. We have often had single plants grown in this way which could not be covered with a bushel basket without doubling up the foliage, and from which over four quarts of berries were picked. If, however, the plants have the vlney habit, when you cut a runner another will start In its place, and it often requires the removal of several runners before a new fruit bud will form. LFor hill culture the ground must be very rich or we cannot fully py the land. To secure the largest yields we must have aa many </seg>

My favorite way, and one involving less labor, Is to grow them In a hedge row. The rows are set thirty to thirty-six Inches apart and plants twenty-four to thirty inches in the row. The first runners are thrown around directly in line and allowed to root bo the plants will stand about ten inches apart when all the others are chipped off. tFor this purpose I used the Planet Jr., rolling runner cutter, which be attached to a cultivator or to a garden wheel hoe. It is the natural inct of the plant to spread its runners out where each new plant be in full sunshine, and so a large majority will be seen trying to b the row, so that this wheel readily cuts them all off.

UMOSELLE, In Fruit Grower. PRUNING THE ORCHARD. rTO PRUNE A COMMERCIAL, ORCHARD— THE FIRST TWO TEARS 1 WORK THE MOST IMPORTANT. In pruning our commercial orchards of thirty-six thousand trees, lo - cated near Nampa, Idaho, we endeavor to develop some fruit the fourth year and increase the amount the fifth season. Trees should yield from two to six boxes to the tree the sixth season. We find our cultivation of sixteen times each season sufficiently effective to grow the trees with ■•dl vigor and rapidity as to be strong enough the sixth year to yield a profitable crop. In pruning the orchard the first two years are the most important The major portion of our western commercial apple orchards are planted </seg>
            <seg id="p259">259 PRUNING THE ORCHARD. with strong one-year-old trees Instead of using two, three, four, or even five-year-old trees, as was our habit in Nebraska. Why does the western planter select the yearling tree? Under irrigation and with the longer season of the intennountaln basin and on the Pacific coast, a well grown one-year-old apple tree may have nearly as much vigor as a medium two-year-old in the central and eastern states. To select a yearling tree for planting enables the orchard - ists to prune in a uniform manner and have practically all of the tree* headed at the same height. The nurseryman favors the sale of trees at the age of one year because he gets a speedy return for labor and capi - tal invested. The one-year-old trees can be afforded at a lower price than the older trees. HOW TO PRUNE ONE-YEAR-OLDS. In pruning the one-year-old tree at time of planting it is well to leave the top bud on the windward side, here the north or northwest side of the tree, to cut the tree at perhaps the height of twenty-four to thirty inches, being governed somewhat by the position of the stronger buds on the trunk. The aim Is to grow three to six shoots the first season to form the branches of the future tree. At the end of the first season it is not well to cut back too close to the trunk. Aim to prune in such form as will develop four, five, or six main branches, and these so distributed that each branch will have plenty of room to develop. Avoid two branches coming out nearly together, since these forking at one point are liable to cause one branch, which, when heavily laden with fruit splits. Some scientific pruner^ aim to start the head of the future tree with re main branches. It will be evident, however, that the greatest num - of boxes of apples can not be borne on a three-branch tree. In the orchard of Manville and Hurst, near Boise, on sixteen-year old trees, each of which produced sixty-two, and sixty-three boxes of apples last fall, we noticed that the most productive trees were trained with five or six main branches, and that the after pruning has been such as to give very large and well branched heads, capable of supporting two thousand five hundred pounds of apples. At this age of the tree in pruning it is well to bear in mind the direc - tion from which the stronger winds blow. Near Nampa they come from the northwest. Aim to save strong buds pushing to the north and north - west; encourage the tree to grow strongly to the north and west and lessen the weight of the growth on the south side. WHAT TO DO SECOND YEAR. In December of the second year's growth of the tree we again prune, leaving from twelve to twenty inches of new wood. Professors Paddock and Whipple, with long experience in Colorado, advise allowing each shoot to make two more the succeeding season, and let the tree gain annually about fourteen inches in length of branch. The Qrand Junc - tion, Colorado, orchardists advise to allow, on thrifty vigorous trees. </seg>
            <seg id="p260">E Inches sain in length of branch. The question of how many * to leave Is a matter of good Judgment and experience. Aim ally to keep the trees strongly to the north. If early fruit is desired, at the end of the season's growth we prone throw the trees into bearing the fourth summer. We should remember e lateral branches are more likely to set fruit buds than upright ranches. The tendency of the most vigorous growth is to the terminal toots of the upright branches. Vigorous growth of upright shoots means ood, not fruit We therefore leave the lateral branches nearly un - ouched, ofttimes full length, because under this method of pruning the teral branches are very likely to set fruit buds the third summer and &gt; fruit with more or less freedom, according to the condition of the tree, the fourth season. TREATMENT THE THIRD YEAR. At the end of the third year's growth we prune in similar method, leaving yet more lateral wood to set fruit buds the fourth season, and come into bearing the fifth year. In pruning our trees we are careful to leave all short twigs and many of the minor branches within the head, since the stronger branches now dominate the growth, take more of the sap and dwarf the inferior shoots. This ofttimes causes these to de - velop fruit buds and later to develop fruit close to the principal branches of the tree, where the fruit can be safely supported, properly nourished and developed. THE FOURTH SEASON. Under the system of cultivation we give, the tree has made a suffi - ciently strong growth with an ample root system and trunk, to prune the four-year-old tree In such form that it should set a considerable number of fruit buds the fifth year and be ready to bear from two to six boxes of fruit fie sixth year. Remembering the strongest sap pressure is upward and the buds on the upright growing branches are best supported and will develop the longest and most vigorous shoots, to make sure of a formation of a considerable number of fruit buds during July, August and September of the fifth season, we leave a considerable number of lateral branches. If the wood is well ripened we may perhaps leave these branches their entire length. If not well ripened shorten them. Because the heaviest growth is thrown into the upright shoots the lateral branches will force a leu vigorous growth and usually develop fruit buds ready to bear a considerable crop the sixth season. It Is more difficult to describe on paper than to show In actual work in the orchard, how pruning should be performed upon the older and bearing trees. t Blast of the Rocky Mountains the character of the months of April May may be such that only a moderate percentage of the. bloom fruit The amount of fruit set may be lessened by unfavorable her, rainfall, fungous diseases or freezing weather. </seg>
            <seg id="p261">PRUNING THE ORCHABD. 261 The orchardists of the central portion of the United States hare not yet, only in comparatively few instances, felt compelled to thin fruit. Weat of the mountains, however, with the greater probability of favorable weather during the blooming period there is a strong probability that more fruit will be set than can be safely carried by the tree. This com - pels us to thin the fruit in June and July and sometimes in August. Since the number of apples must be lessened something can be done in pruning to lessen the amount of fruit-bearing wood and lessen the amount of fruit that must be carefully removed in thinning. The lntermountain and Pacific coast orchardists therefore would leave a smaller amount of bearing wood, fruit spurs, and fruit buds than would be left by the or - chardists of the central portion of the United States or the far East states. These considerations have weight and are taken into account In deciding on methods of pruning. The pruning during the life of the tree should be such as not to leave long naked branches. Guard against this by pruning annually. Endeavor to have bearing twigs and branches distributed well over the tree in such manner that the tree is well able to support the load of fruit without the necessity of props or the danger of breaking down. In the Manville and Hurst orchards near Boise, we notice they hare been particularly successful in distribution of the fruit well over the tree and have developed fruit-bearing, short branches and small limbs on the main and minor branches of the tree, the fruit being near enough to the stronger branches to bear very heavy loads without breaking down. It is of the utmost importance that apple trees should receive annual pruning, otherwise long shoots, four, five and six feet in length, may be thrown out The fruit is ultimately borne away out on these long branches, which bend under the great weight and ofttimes break. Tree* suffering from this lack of pruning were very noticeable in the Payette Valley in the fall of 1910 when many overladen and Improperly formed trees were badly broken. THE TIME OP PRUNING. Based on our forty years' experience in Nebraska with the largeat commercial interests in that state, it has been our habit to utilize all good weather from late November on. The cultivation and care of the trees should be such as to ripen the wood in early October, after which the trees may be pruned whenever dormant or not severely frozen. We pre - fer late November and December pruning because at that season we are likely to have good weather. Our men worked all through this last De - cember, rapidly and with comfort By the end of December we had pruned our own orchard of thirty-six thousand trees and some four hun - dred acres for other parties. In January we had deep snow followed later by deep mud, making the conditions tiresome for our workmen in walking from tree to tree. 80 far we have pruned something more than 1,300 acres of orchard thia winter and we yet have a force of men engaged in pruning for other </seg>

TREATING OLD ORCHARD. rYING AND SYSTEMATIC PRUNING WORK WONDERS IN A NORTH CAROLINA ORCHARD. I The late Dr. Knapp showed a deep understanding of human nature, en he said: "If you tell a man anything, he won't believe it, you may iw him, and he won't believe it; but you make him do it with his own ids and he believes," or words to that effect. Dr. Knapp was speaking reference to agricultural methods in the south and in favor and ex - nation of his plan of demonstration farms. He did great work for the ith through that plan, and we have today demonstration orchards in iry section, monuments to the benefits of spraying. Three years ago the writer bought a small place in the Blue Ridge mountains, with a small neglected orchard on it. We were busy the first year in building, but noticed that in August the leaves became affected with small brown spots, and before the end of that month had nearly all fallen off. The fruit was scattering and small, and a neighbor said the trees had been planted about twenty-five years, and never had a decent tThe following winter we pruned the sky-scaping tops entirely out, also Ding the lower part of the trees, and in most cases getting what would ; for a "sane and safe" tree, one from which the apples could be picked i an eighteen-foot ladder. Now, having pruned the tops, we next proceeded to prune the roots, and this is the way we went at it: We took a good sharp two-horse plow and two good heavy mules and a willing but skeptical man, and plowed as deep as eight inches right up to the trees, snapping and cutting roots ruth - lessly, for mind you, we were considering the removal of the entire orchard, as the trees had been neglected so long that borers had made a sad depredation among them. At this plowing we turned under quite a crop of wild strawberry vines, some grass and a lot of briar and small stunted weeds; then we seeded to crimson clover, Inoculating the seed. We hired a man with a minia - ture fire department to do the spraying, for we had never done any spray - ing, and he had an orchard. But when he drove up without having made any solution, we were nearly discouraged, and when he turned his solid stream on the trees, we told the good woman of the house that it would be as well to pay the man and let him go home, for having read The Fruit Grower, we could easily distinguish between spraying and squirting. That fall we had quite a crop of cider apples, but not a decent speci - men In the entire lot; the leaves had again fallen during July and August, </seg>

The following winter we cut out the water sprouts, and in the spring we sowed floats at the rate of four hundred pounds to the acre, turned un - der the crimson clover and sowed to cowpeas, and bought a sprayer which would throw a mist or spray, a regular fog, for we had determined to give the old trees a chance regardless of the fact that people said they cojld never amount to anything. We turned pigs in to harvest the cowpeas and drop apples, and if any man has gathered a crop of smoother larger apples of the varieties than we did this fall, I have not seen them; understand, it was not a full crop, neither did all the trees bear fruit, but the leaves are still on the trees, and cider apples are a scarce article with us, though some of the trees were loaded to the breaking point. Now, a word as to spraying: We bought the commercial lime-sulphur, sprayed with a 1-10 solution early in the spring before the buds started; when the petals began to fall, we sprayed with a 1-40 solution to which we added Paris green at the rate of two ounces to 50 gallons, mixing It first carefully with a small quantity of water and keeping the whole thor - oughly agitated, and we put that mist to those trees over, under and through until they were as wet as though in a heavy fog. t Three weeks later, we sprayed again with the same mixture, and I it say in explanation, that our reason for using the Paris green was we could not get arsenate of lead when we wanted it, and had the r on hand. All last winter we were contemplating the removal of the trees, for they occupy land which we wanted for raising swine, but it looks to us now, having completed the harvest of that fine crop, like we can grow forage crops for the hogs on this orchard, at the same time improve the land, and raise more and better apples with which to buy tankage and other food for the hogs, thus producing double the amount of food, for with us, the breeding of pure swine is pre-eminent, and if we can raise one crop on the ground, and at the same time another above it, we ought to bj sat- — W. W. Shay, in Fruit Grower. North Carolina, THINK OF RAISING FRUIT? rE VALUABLE SUGGESTIONS FOR THE BEGINNER IN SETTING OUT AND CARING FOR AN ORCHARD. Chat. A. Cole In Fruit Grower. Without doubt a very large percentage of the beginners in the orchard business come from the city and non-fruit growing sections. These per - sons, as well as others, are confronted with the problem of choosing a local - ity or section in which to begin their chosen profession. I say "begin" ad - visedly, as this profession is like unto the saying of the Master Builder, </seg>
            <seg id="p264">264 "many seek, but few findeth." AH fruit sections, near fruit sections an make-believe fruit sections are eager to attract buyers, and each claims be the original Garden of Eden. If the land a "shark" is trying to sell not in a fruit section it is in close proximity, as one man advertised Ian as being near or adjacent to the Rogue River country, when in fact it was about 100 miles distant, and that across the mountains. Another man In Chicago sold a foreign "sucker" a piece of fruit land (five acres) southeastern Oregon, unseen, which was 150 miles on a bee line from t! nearest railroad. After a would-be fruit grower has read all the dope fro different sections he is in no condition to make a selection. If you are u able to visit the different sections look into the reliability of the agent company you are about to deal with. However, if it is at all possible, vis the different sections and see for yourself just what they are doing. Aft 700 have selected a locality it would be well to get an expert to pass upon the tract before buying. Nearness to markets and transportation are very important considera - tions. The markets are of two kinds, namely, home and foreign. In other words, you sell your crop in a nearby town, or ship. A large percentage expect to ship their output and to this class the question of transportation is of very great importance. Unless you can be absolutely sure of this factor, it will be best for you to look further. Get as close to the shipping point as possible, as long hauls by wagon will take a big slice out of your THE SITE. When you have decided on a locality, whether in the northwest, west, middle west or east, close attention must be paid to the particular site on which the orchard will be planted. Study this spot with reference to soil, elevation and water and air drainage. Any soil that has a depth of four feet and will produce a good yield of farm crops will produce fruit trees, especially apples and pears. However, whether or not these trees will produce fruit depends on the drainage. Trees will not thrive where they have wet feet; that is, the soil being waterlogged two-thirds of the year. The water keeps out the air and forces the tree to form its roots near the surface. When a dry spell comes on, the tree cannot mature its crop properly for lack of nourishment, as the water table has dropped far out of reach of the shallow roofs. A site on which the air will not circulate readily is to be avoided. The tree may do well, but the loss of crop from frost will be frequent. The work of the frost on such a spot was well illustrated in a newly planted vineyard in this locality. While the sur - rounding country is ideally suited to fruit growing this one tract has a depression of about one-third of an acre in extent, and the lowest point was not over five feet below the surrounding land; yet the leaves on the vines in this low spot were frosted at least a month in advance of other plants. The reason for this is that cold air settles down into the depres - sions and if it cannot flow off rapidly frost will appear here before it will on well-drained land. </seg>
            <seg id="p265">SITTING OUT AN ORCHARD. 265 PREPARING THE SOIL. The land being secured, or if the prospective fruit raiser is already a land owner, the next step will be putting it in shape for the trees. The amount of labor and money that will have to go into this phase of the work will depend on whether or not you have purchased improved land. As an example, let us take some of our northwestern soil, covered with fir or pine. I have seen some of this burned over land that could be put in shape for the trees for about $25 per acre. However, this is not the rule. The usual cost will be nearer $100 per acre, and much runs up to $250 to $300 per acre. Improved land at $100 to $250 per acre is always cheaper than $50 land in the rough. Sometimes the heavy timber is chopped off and sold, the smaller growth slashed and burned, then a bunch of goats turned loose on what is left for four or five years. By this time the small stuff will have decayed. The big stumps are either split with powder, then pulled out, or burned out by piling wood around them, cover - ing this over with bark, then dirt, and starting a fire in a vent left for that purpose. This is known as charcoal pitting, and it takes something of an expert at the Jpb to be, as I say, a "roaring success." Sometimes the man who is doing the work thinks it more economical to shoot the stump clear out of the ground. This leaves quite a hole, and will cost about $5 for the "prize" stumps. Of course if you are in a big hurry you can shoot the green stump, then pull it out with a donkey engine. All grubs, stumps and trash should be removed before planting. One thing we are very thank - ful for is the fact that all the good fruit land is not confined to the fir and pine districts. After the ground is cleared of all trash it must be given a good, deep plowing. Our land here is free from timber, so we can go ahead with the plow. We used two big gas engines, each pulling eight plows and a drag harrow. These plows were put down twelve inches deep, thus producing an ideal bed for setting trees. This deep plowing is very necessary, as it is the last time the soil can be stirred deeply in the spot the tree will occupy, that is by plowing. I know some orchards that experts thought advisable to have the soil loosened deeply just where the tree stood, so a hole was bored down under the tree three or four feet in depth and one - half stick of giant powder dropped in and fired. Excellent results were re - ported. However, we must not neglect the first plowing, even if we can resort to such drastic treatment. SYSTEM FOR LAYING OUT THE ORCHARD. Of course you have been figuring on just what system you are going to use in laying out your orchard. There are four that are most generally used. They are the square, quincunx, hexagonal and contour. The first is most generally used, as it gives more room for inter-cropping. The quin - cunx system is simply the square system with a tree set in the center of the square. The hexagonal is set on an equilateral triangle which, when all of the trees are in, gives an appearance of one tree surrounded with six, or a hexagon. The contour is used on hill sides, and especially where irrl- </seg>
            <seg id="p266">266 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. gation is to be used. The rows follow the contour of the hill, thus allowin a gradual slope for running the water. The latter system is very litt ■Md. Some prefer the hexagonal system as the largest number of trees can be planted per acre without crowding, as each tree is exactly the sam distance from every other tree. The number of trees per acre for eac system when a given distance is used, is as follows: Take thirty feet as the distance, and with the square system you will have 48 trees, the qui cunx 84, and the hexagonal 55; or, if you want it in percentages, th quincunx will give you 75 per cent more than the square, and the hex agonal 15 per cent more than the square. LAYING OUT THE FIELD. t There are several ways by which the trees can be gotten into straight ■s. I will mention two which are very satisfactory. One is to set every ■d or fourth row of stakes with a compass, then stick the rows between stretching a chain across and stick in pegs to mark the places for the ;s. Land can be staked off by this means for about 50 cents per acre. &gt; other system is the wire. We have used the three wires here in the riston Orchards, and have set 5,500 acres with excellent results. Our es are what is known as wire rope or cables, built on the same plan as se that are used for clothes lines, only larger. The markers are made out of a small strip of tin, bent around the wire, then a small stove bolt, put through the ends, thus forming a clamp. If the wire stretches these markers can be readjusted. We go over our wires every few days and ad- Just mil buttons or markers. In making the marker, have as few sharp edges as possible. tin making up our wires we used a thirty-foot distance, and as our nting was on the square, with a filler in the center our two side lines re spaced fifteen feet apart. The cross line in this case also had .but - 8 spaced fifteen feet apart. The ends of the wires were provided with gs for the anchors, which consisted of an iron rod one inch in thickness 1 three feet long. Our land is cut up into five-acre tracts, with a stake each corner. A wire is stretched down each side of a lot, which is 620 t long, and the cross wire is stretched across one end fifteen feet from l proposed fence line. We use a man for each thirty-foot button. He plants his tree; the wire is shifted to the next button, which is fifteen feet, and the man shifts er to the fifteen-foot button on the cross wire. This is the filler. When le wire is moved again, the planter shifts back to the thirty-foot buttons. We find this a rapid, accurate method. On good ground a crew of eleven en and a foreman have set as high as twenty acres per day. The rows are absolutely straight. We have set as high as 640 acres in a single ock, and the rows were a mile in length, also crossing quite large hol - ows, yet these rows could not have been run across the field by a sur - eyor with any more accuracy. If you wish to use the hexagonal system, the same wires can be used, but the position of the buttons will have to be changed on the cross line; </seg>
            <seg id="p267">BETTING OUT AN ORCHARD. 267 that is, if you are going to use the thirty-foot distance. If you use another distance all the buttons will have to be changed. For the thirty-foot dis - tances set the buttons on the cross wire twenty-five feet apart. In plant - ing, the crew will set the first tree at the fifty-foot marks on the cross line, then when the shift to the next button on the side lines is made, the crew will plant at the twenty-five foot buttons. If you do not wish to purchase the woven wire cable, a common grape wire will answer very well. LWhen ready to prepare the wires, stretch them as tight as possible, level piece of ground, and use an accurate measure for locating the mis. The object is to have all wires uniform. FILLERS. Will it pay to put in fillers? This question can be answered, yes, and no. It depends on the kind of filler. We put in fillers to increase the re - turns for the first few years. Sometimes the returns are reduced by an injudicious use of fillers. In sections where the peach will thrive this fruit is used. This is a good tree for some localities, but even in some peach sections it is not advisable to use it. I have seen this filler removed after the fifth year because it did not pay. The reason was choice of wrong varieties. These persons planted early varieties and when they came into bearing, the crop ripened just two weeks later than the same variety on a lower level not three miles distant. If you are going to use the peach, it will be well to go into the matter pretty thoroughly. In almost any section it is best to stick to the shippers. When you have made your choice of variety, don't be a hog and plant two fillers to each permanent tree. I have seen growers fall down just as hard on this point as on the wrong variety. The apple or pear makes a good filler. We are using these two kinds of fruit to the exclusion of all others. Select varieties that come into fruiting at an early age. The Jonathan, Rome Beauty and Winesap are excellent for this purpose. We set our trees 30 x 30 feet, with the filler in K center. This will allow us to make use of the filler for twelve to fif - years before it will have to be removed. For pears, we use Bartlett, ter Nellis and d'Anjou. If one wishes quick returns the small fruits are the best fillers, and especially is this true of the strawberry. If you are going to use this fruit, don't, by all means, plant it closer than five feet of the young tree. As the trees increase in size, widen the cultivated space on each side of the tree. As I have said before, the filler is used for the purpose of increasing the returns from the orchard for the first few years, and just as soon as the permanent trees begin to need the space the filler must come out Tour business is to produce a high-grade orchard, and nothing must be allowed to check its growth. We use the filler with either the square, hexagonal or quincunx sys - tems. When the latter system is used, plant the varieties you select 20 x 20, and when the trees begin to crowd, chop oat </seg>
            <seg id="p268">268 FALL OR SPRING PLANTING. There Is considerable discussion as to which is the best time (or Bet - tine trees. I have had good success with both fall and spring planting. This year our (all planting was somewhat better than the spring plant. Both were done under the same foremen and exactly the same soil condi - tions. The trees planted in the fall have at least one month the start of those planted in the spring. Part of this start is due to the warm soil in the fall and part to the soil becoming well settled around the roots before spring. Where the winters are very severe planting must be put off until Good nursery stock is very essential to a good growth of tree. Don't buy the largest tree you can find. You will not get a good stand with this kind of a tree, for the simple reason that all the feeding roots are cut off when the tree is dug. On the other hand, don't buy a small tree, just be - aause it is cheap. The stocky, medium-sized one-year-old tree is the best You can bring this kind of a tree up in the way that it should go. K your stock arrives before the soil is ready, dig a trench and heel the trees in. Cut the bundles and spread out the roots so that the soil will sift down in among them. Tramp the soil in well, so that the trees will not dry out. K you cannot get your trees in until late, they should be heeled in where the sun will not shine on them. After a tree starts into growth, then planted it will not give as good a growth as a perfectly dormant tree. Where the trees are to remain in the pit all winter at least half their length should be covered. We put 150,000 trees into our pits last (all and covered to within a foot of the top. The trees came out of the pits in good condition. Of course, such deep covering will not be necessary in Tery mild winter; that is, where the temperature does not go much below 2'.i degrees. When everything is ready for planting, the trees are taken out of the pit — that is, as many as needed for a day's or half day's planting, and loaded into the planting wagon. Our wagons are of the low iron-wheeled type, with a six-inch bed. A layer of straw is put in, then the trees. The whole is covered with old sacks, then thoroughly watered. A wagon rover is thrown over the bed and the wagon is ready for the field. We f.nd that this keeps the trees in excellent condition. I The wires are stretched and a hole dug, so that the button is over its er. Be sure and get the hole large enough so that there will be no ;er of cramping the roots, and deep enough so that the tree can be it least three inches deeper than it stood in the nursery row. Take a out of the wagon and prune off all broken roots, cut back all ragged i, and all long roots, to eight or ten inches. Place the tree in the , so that the body is in line with the button, and fill in with the top until the roots are covered, then get in the hole with both feet and IP the soil down firmly.

Peach trees are cut to the first height, and apples, pears and crab apples to the latter. If the planting is done in the fall, the trees need not be headed back until towards spring. There is one serious drawback to fall planting, and that is the rab - bits. The jackrabbit is the worst of all. We hare used protection, but with no degree of success. The method that has been fairly successful was to put a man out on the tract with a dog and gun.

NOW IT'S TREE DOCTORS. HEALING WOUNDS, FIXING BROKEN LIMBS AND FILLING CAVITIES IN TREES IS THEIR MISSION. Pi you know what a tree doctor is? No? Well, he is one of the claimants for attention in horticultural work. He is just like any doctor, in that his business is that of treating the sick, but his patients are trees, rather than man or animals. As a profession tree doc - toring is yet in its initial stages, but it is a thrifty youngster, and tree doctors there will be in plenty ere another decade passes. The business of a tree doctor is essentially that of repairing wounded trees, so that they may continue their usefulness for years. There is no good reason why beautiful shade trees, or prime fruit trees should decline and be broken to pieces by storms. A little skillful attention can put the tree into shape that rivals its youthful vigor. In the parks and lawns of the eastern cities the work of the tree doctor is coming to be more and more in evidence, but it is spreading westward, and tree doctors are finding a world of work in the city parks and in the orchards of the great fruit dis - tricts of the middle west. John Davey is the father of tree doctoring, and has fostered and en - couraged the business for a lifetime. For years he worked alone, but the demands upon his skill necessitated his training others in the work, and now there are Davey Tree Experts by the dozen. As a class, they are E, agile, well-trained young men, who love the beauties of nature and have a deeper understanding of the ailments of patriarchal trees than the skilled orchardist or forester. Early in the summer of 1911, some of these young men representing John Davey were in the city of St. Joseph, Mo., rejuvenating some stately shade trees, and the work came to the attention of John Donovan. Now, John Donovan had a family orchard of ancient lineage, that was his pride and joy, but several of the trees were on the downward road, because Mr. Donovan made no pretenses at being a thorough orchardist, and the storms, insects and fungi were beginning to leave their footprints in this family orchard. At the suggestion of one of his neighbors, Mrs. S. N. Cox, </seg>
            <seg id="p270">270 who is an experienced orchardist, Mr. Donovan asked Mr. R. O. Kellar of the "Davey gang" to inspect his orchard trees and report their condition, and whether there were any hopes of saving these trees by the Davey way. Mr. Kellar'B report was accepted, and he and his associates, T. M. and J. C. Loiry and W. J. Auwood of the Davey Tree Expert Co. were in - structed to make the necessary repairs to some of the most seriously wounded of these trees in Mr. Donovan's orchard. CLEAN OUT THE CAVITIES. Eiit-Grower readers are familiar with the usual processes of rejuve - old orchards by pruning, spraying and cultivating, but the Davey is something different. This work consists essentially in cleaning out the rotten cavities and filling them with cement. Now this sounds like a simple thing. It is simple, but like many other extremely simple operations, it takes a high degree of skill to do it with utmost success. Many of us have tried filling boles in trees with cement. I remember very well the first attempt I made at such work. It was done when I was a youngster. I filled a decaying cavity in an old Transcendant crab apple tree with cement, but the effort would have done the tree more good if it had been applied to a nearby fence post. But I did not do my work in the Davey way. I neglected, or rather overlooked the first essential. I failed to clean ont the decaying wood within the cavity, and then sterilize the interior so as to kill all of the germs and fungi. That is the founda - tion of success, and in these trees in Mr. Donovan's orchard, I had op - portunity of observing the rare with which experts in this work cleaned out and sterilized the rotten places. Most of these trees had split at the fork where the head of the tree branched out from the trunk. On but few of the trees was there any evi - dence of internal decay, to the inexperienced eye, but when the "Davey gang" opened up these wounds it was found that the heart of most of these split forks was a mass of decaying wood, burrowed through and through by ants and other insects. Opening these wounds was done with chisels. The sides of the crack were cut out, and the split followed down as far as necessary, sometimes to the surface of the ground. The opening was made wide enough to al - low the entire heart of the tree to be chipped out with the chisels, and sometimes the decay had to be dug out of the main roots, and even up into the branches. WheL this was done, three or four heavy bolts were put through the trunk in a criss-cross manner, and drawn up tight, but not so tight as to draw the spilt together. Then hardwood wedges were, driven into the split just between the bolts. These wedges were driven In Just as tightly as possible, for the purpose of increasing the tension on the bolts and avoiding any possibility of a strain that would subsequently break the wood away from the cement filling. </seg>
            <seg id="p271">tree nrx-ToitiNi;. 271 ONE WAY TO FILL HOLES. When the wedges were driven in, and their ends sawed off flush with the outside, the entire surface of the cavity was coated with a strong anti - septic, either corrosive sublimate solution or Carbolineum. This latter antiseptic was considered the better of the two, as it is more penetrating, and is less soluble in water than the corrosive sublimate. Then after the cavity had dried a little from its antiseptic bath, it was filled with cement. Now to fill a cavity with cement is an easy job, but the way the aver - age man fills a hole in a tree with cement always reminds me of the filling I put in that old Transcendant tree. There is a trick about filling a hollow tree in such a way that the cement will not crack to pieces, and perhaps be pushed out from the wood so that the water and fungi can find en - trance. But the filling does not break when it is put in in the Davey way. Mr. Davey learned years ago, that there was only one way to do the work and keep the cement from falling out, and also to keep water from gaining entrance to the filled cavity. This is done by a little V-shaped groove made just inside the margin of the wood and extending entirely around it. This is so important a feature that it is really the key to the situation, and for the purpose of protecting his discovery, Mr. Davey obtained a patent on the process. LBut to return to the way these Davey experts filled the cavities with ent. Small holes were filled solid with cement, and the filling allowed to come just flush with the surface of the wood, and not allowed to ex - tend out on the bark the least bit. To do this,' and to be sure the healing callus could not get under the cement, a little strip of bark, possibly half an inch wide, was cut away from the margin of the cavity. This made it easy to bring the cement even with the surface of the wood, and the new bark could heal over the entire filling as easily as if it had been the real wood of the trees. REINFORCING. When the filling of cement was of large size, extending well up and down the tree, with a large surface exposed, it became necessary to make allowance for the swaying of the tree during heavy winds. If the core of cement extended for a distance of a couple or more feet in length, it would be in danger of cracking, as the tree swayed back and forth in a heavy gale. To prevent this, the cement core was put in in layers. Sections were made, varying from a few inches high in trunks of small diameter to a foot or more in larger trunks. These sections were reinforced with wires criss-crossed within the cavity, and then separated from each other by a pad of tarred paper. This made joints that could "give" as the tree swayed, and the cement filling be in no danger of breaking. It was necessary always to reinforce the cement filling in all of the larger cavities, to give additional strength to the cement. This reinforce - ment was made with galvanized wire, fastened from side to side in the cavity with nails. </seg>
            <seg id="p272">272 I But as a further safeguard to the reinforcement, and to further guard net the possibility of water getting in between the wood and cement, od coat of paint was applied to the outside of the wound as soon as the ent was dry enough to let the paint stick. All of the wounds that e treated were painted at the finish, but some of them were covered 1 sheet xinc or lead. Zinc was used mostly over the cement fillings, t could be easily cut the shape of the filling, and was then tacked 11 tightly along its margin, with big-headed brads set about a quarter n inch apart all around. But in doing this due allowance was made freedom to sway in the wind. The zinc was put on in much the same iner as shingles on a house. Short strips were used, and lapped over i other for an inch or so. Where these laps were made, only the un - strip was tacked. COVERING THE WOUNDS. I The bolts that were put through the trees were counter sunk on both es, and then covered with sheet lead, or in some cases with zinc. The d was considered better, as sometimes the shell of the tree would be thin the bolt could not be counter sunk deep enough to let the bolt be ow the inner bark line. Here the sheet lead was used, because it ild be pounded into shape over the nut, and be made to fit down snug I tight. Then it was tacked tight all around the edge, just as was the c. I Another use to which this sheet zinc was put, and one which could 1 wide application in all of the orchards of the country, is that of cov - ig up large wounds where big limbs have been cut off. These Davey •erts put a little cover of zinc over every wound that is two inches or re in diameter. These zinc covers are tacked down carefully all und the edge and then thoroughly painted. When this zinc cover is ■uch size that it covers practically the entire surface of the wound, still leaves a little ring just inside the inner surface of the bark, it kes a waterproof cover that effectually protects the wood from any sibility of decay. But if the zinc cover laps over the bark, or is not ked down tight, and then reinforced with paint, it is worse than no er, as it will let water enter as the zinc is lifted by the healing callus, I conserves it for the fungi of decay. CHAIN THE LIMBS TOGETHER. The question will arise in the minds of many as to how effectual the bolts mentioned above will serve in keeping trees from splitting or break - ing, especially when the limbs are long and heavy above the point at which the bolts are placed. It is very true that there is every possibility for the limbs to break off above the bolts, and even if they do not break, they can sway sufficiently in the summer storms to wrench them away from the cement filling, and let the spore of decay find entrance again. But John Davey thought this all out as he was perfecting his process of </seg>
            <seg id="p273">THE NEHRASKA SAND HILLS. 273 treating such cases. Trees which he has fixed will not break apart, for high up in the branches a strong chain is fastened from limb to limb in such a way as to make a substantial brace and guard against any possi - bility of splitting. But these chains are not wrapped around the limbs. They are fastened to big lag screws. The screws are put into the limbs; the limbs are drawn together just a little so as to give them tension, then the chain is hooked over the lag screws, and the job is finished. There is only the faintest chance of such a tree ever breaking down, and one which has been worked over, as these Davey experts worked over these apple trees of Mr. Donovan are as good as new, and really far better than they would be if given the ordinary treatment in the way of repair or rejuvena - tion. Now, the questions come, is the work expensive, and will it pay in the orchard? Yes, the work is expensive. Expert workmen require good salaries and careful work takes time to do, so that repair work such a this costs a pretty stiff figure. But is it worth while? I shall answer tha by asking another question: Is an orchard of bearing age, and in goo health and vigor worth any more than an orchard that is just planted Is it worth while to save ten years of time? That Is just what has bee done in this orchard. The trees which have been worked over are re - stored to their former vigor, in fact it is safe to say they are stronger to - day than they have ever been. They are loaded with fruit buds, an&lt; every one of them is capable of producing a couple of barrels or more o apples next year. It has taken them almost twenty years to reach this size, and by the repair work twenty years have been saved. Is it worth while? You can answer. — Fruit Grower. GLIMPSES OF THE NEBRASKA SAND HILLS* By Raymond J. Pool, Associate Professor of Botany, University of Nebraska. Thousands of years ago when the forces of nature were at work shifting and gradually shaping the features of the Great Plains, large areas of sandstones were exposed in Dakota, Wyoming, Nebraska, Kan - sas and other parts of the western plains. As topographic features were slowly evolved, these sandstones, being young and soft, readily yielded to the eroding action of the elements and were reduced to light, fine - grained sand. In addition to this sand formed in situ probably consid - erable amounts of other sands were washed or blown into the region from farther west. Great quantities of the sand thus formed were caught up by the wind and heaped into mounds that finally grew to be large sand dunes extending in long ranges and ridges for many miles over the sandstone beds. Thus were the Sand Hills of the prairies and great plains formed in the days preceding the advent of plants or men * Tliis article la a modification of n paper pnMished in the Popular Science Monthly for March, 1012, under the title.

The Sand Hill landscape in these early days was probably a rest - less maze of wandering sand dunes. In later years certain plants crept in from the surrounding plains, only to be uprooted and blown away. After many such invasions some individuals finally succeeded in main - taining a foothold in the more protected portions of the hills. Notwith - standing the terrible conditions imposed by an arid climate and a continually shifting soil, vegetation continued to spread to other areas from these primary centers of establishment. Eome time after the Sand Hill flora had gained a lasting bold upon unes and the greenish hue of vegetation had spread over the great ise of hills, enormous herds of bison came charging into the region in quest of forage. 1 he vegetation was closely grazed and tramped into the unstable soil. And then the red man came, who killed the bison for food, clothing and for many other useful purposes. He sought to improve the range for the wild beast and for his own stock by burn - ing the grass at certain seasons of the year. In this way a third and still greater menace was forced upon the plants that were struggling so hard to cover the Sand Hills with a permanent mantle of vegetation. The Sand Hill region of Nebraska is one of the largest and best known portions of the sand hills of the Great Plains. In our state the main body of Sand Hills is oblong in shape with irregular margins. This region lies north and west of the central portion of the state. On the northern edge of the region there are numerous deep canyons with steep, more or less wooded sides. A few more or less isolated areas of Sand Hills occur outside this great main region both north and south of the Platte. re Sand Hills of Nebraska cover an area of more than 18,000 square almost one-fourth of the total area of the state. This is about to the combined areas of New Hampshire and Vermont. The hills are all round-topped or conical and smooth, clearly showing that they had been shaped by the wind long before their invasion by plants. There are many depressions between the hills, many of which assume the proportions of valleys more than a mile in width and sometimes many miles in length. From these well-developed valleys the low places decrease in both width and length until they are mere narrow, saucer - shaped basins or "pockets" a few hundred yards across. The well-pro - iiounced valleys are, as a rule, about parallel and trend in a general southeast and northwest direction. Such valleys are frequently com - pletely inclosed by ranges of hills and in this way effectively sepa - rated from adjacent valleys, though such may not be more than a half mile distant. Sometimes instead of the valleys being separated by a range of round-topped hills this is accomplished by a continuous rounded ridge. The sides of these hills are often very steep, making difficult the direct passage over from one valley to another. </seg>
            <seg id="p275">275 In the regions of widest valleys the ranges of hills often show a suc- cession of higher hills as one passes back from the valley to the highest points on the divide, -which may be 300 feet above the level of the val- ley. In the regions characterized by short valleys and basins the gen- eral landscape is strikingly different because in such places the hills rise on all sides without any regularity. Low hills, intermediate hills and high hills are all closely associated, with no long separating valleys. The result is a very abruptly rolling surface with rounded or oblong depressions of varying depth, with the rounded or conical dunes above. There are places where this sort of topography stretches in all direc- tions as far as one can see. As the name implies, the hills are composed of sand. This sand la of a light straw color composed mostly of fine grained quartz. The purest sand is found in the newest soil areas such as in "blow-outs" or other places where the overlying vegetation has been completely removed by the wind. In many places, notably in the river thickets and in the numerous thickets scattered throughout the hills, there is a copi- ous admixture of organic remains and so the surface soil in such places is a rich black sandy loam and is very fertile. But the characteristic soil of the region as a whole is the pure dune sand composed of fine particles. As to the chemical nature of the sand, the following table shows it to be very high in insoluble mineral matter and very low In soluble organic or inorganic plant-food materials.

            <seg id="p276">276 tSuch a loose sandy soil soaks up moisture very readily, so that after eavy fall of rain scarcely any water is drained from the surface into valleys, but all of it goes into the porous soil. Now and then rain - ins of such torrential fierceness occur in the hills that a great quan - of the sand is brought down from high on the hills and carried into valleys. Such storms are, however, exceptional, since the usual vler rains of about 1.0 — 1.5 in. are completely taken up by the sand, i no surface drainage at all. Iln connection with the distribution of soil water in the Sand Hills Is interesting to note that, although the surface of the sand is com - nJy as dry as powder, the sand but a few inches beneath the surface quite moist The average of many soil samples taken during July, 1 (a wet month for that year), in widely isolated stations at a depth twelve inches, showed the water content to be 3.27 per cent. The id Hills rest upon a series of relatively impermeable clays and stratl- I rocks. These layers of more solid materials crop out from the sur - e along streams and on the lower slopes of some hills quite remote m the deeper valleys. The soil is always moister upon a slope with «e outcrops than In situations where such are absent The annual precipitation over the main body of Sand Hills varies rom twenty-three inches in the east to about fifteen Inches on the estern border. April. May and June are usually the wettest months of le year, while the dry season frequently continues from August to arch or the first of April. 1 In the central Sand Hills during the onth of July, 1911, five and one-half inches of rain fell. At the gov - rnment forest nursery near Halsey (Thomas County) during this month ere was scarcely a day that rain did not fall. The showers were usu - ly light, but a few were soaking rains. Hail sometimes accompanies lese thunderstorms in such quantity that a great amount of damage s done to gardens, crops und other property. Most of the precipitation disappears into the soil at once. It is a rare sight, if indeed it ever happens, that any of the streams or lakes of the region show an increase in volume resulting from the run-off from even the heaviest downpour. Because of the general porous nature of the soil the region is characterized by 6ub-surface drainage. The fluc - tuations in the ground water from time to time produce differences in the level of the lakes and ponds. During especially wet seasons the level of the lakes may be perceptibly elevated, due in all probability to seepage from the surrounding hills. The most important stream of the Sand Hills is the Loup River, the three forks of which rise in low swampy flats toward the central portion of the region. Through the Sand Hills portion of its course the Middle Loup has a fall of about eight feet per mile and so develops considerable current which causes its bed and its channel to shift continually. The sand banks are cut and the channel veers from side to side along its course. This tendency culminates in the formation of many "oxbows" • D»ta from official record* of C. S. Forest Service at Halsey, Nebr., for last </seg>
            <seg id="p277">277 or loops. ooxne of these loops are most perfect and beautiful mm viewed from far up in the hills. The streams of the region are all shallow, the Loup varying from one to six feet in depth with a channel about fifty yards wide. In many places such streams are extremely beautiful with their winding channels of clear swift water and fringes of vegetation. tThe Dismal River is an important tributary to the Loup. Heading the swamp and lake region of Hooker, Grant and McPherson counties, continues eastward for about seventy-five or eighty miles, and pours into the Loup at Dunning. This river is an especially welcome sight as one suddenly comes upon it hidden in a deep valley (almost a gorge in many places) after a long, slow, hot ride of thirty miles or more over the hills. The Dismal has cut in a number of places a very deep canyon through the hills. Often the sides of this canyon are almost perpen - dicular, while elsewhere the banks are not so high or steep. Now and then the stream leaps over a ledge of sandstone producing a waterfall • few feet in height which adds to the beauty of the landscape. There are in truth many spots along the Dismal that would make worthy sub - jects for the landscape painter. Few would classify Nebraska among the states with lakes, but as a matter of fact there are hundreds of lakes in the state. Many of these lakes are in the Sand Hills, where they usually occur in groups of few to many in various parts of the region. The largest group occurs In Cherry County, with fifty or more lakes. Some of these, such as Hack - berry, Dad's, Clear, Willow, Dewey, Red Deer, etc., furnish excellent sport to the fisherman and the hunter. Aquatic vegetation furnishes Endant food for both fish and fowl. The lakes vary from small ponds undred yards across to bodies of water a mile or more wide and four five miles long. There are many people who still think that the Sand Hill region is a plantless waste of wandering dunes. This is far from fact, but never - theless the vegetation of the region is sparse and there are also many instances of actively moving sands, although by far the greatest portion of the area is effectively protected from wind erosion by the presence of vegetation. Nowhere except In the moister habitats, as in the val - leys, do the plants grow densely or close together. On the hills proper the light-colored sand always shows between the individual plants. In places one may cross over areas two hundred yards or more in width and count all of the plants in his path on his fingers. F the sparseness of the vegetation there are very species represented in the Sand Hill flora, but in spite of this number of species that are found over the hills and ridges and in the valleys, the most striking characteristic of Sand Hill vegetation is its great monotony due to the domination of bunch-grasses, which are the controlling elements of the floral covering of the whole region. The bunch-grasses are so named because from each root there arise many </seg>
            <seg id="p278">278 NKBRA8KA STATE HORTICULTURAL 8OC1KTV straight, wiry stems in close proximity, so that a clump or bundle of fifty to a hundred or moie stems are densely crowded together. These bunches occur more or less scattered in a way tuch that the character - istic tutted nature of the vegetation results, and the numerous smaller ■pad— that occur in the intervals are quite effectively concealed. A plant association composed of bunch-grasses is the typical vegeta - tion of the whole Sand Hill region. This covers the hills and ridges over thousands of square miles, being absent mainly from the "blow - outs" and the moister valleys. Once established in the sandy soil the bunch-grasses cope very successfully with the fury of the wind and the shifting sand. However, if fire or over-grazing seriously reduces the bunches in size and vitality, subsequent winds may uproot and carry them away. But on the whole the bunch-grasses are very effective sand binders, and it would be a great calamity indeed if they were to be re - moved and nothing substituted. It is due to them more than to 'any other single type of plants that the vegetation of the hills is enabled to persist. Within the shelter of the bunch-grass association valuable species thrive that in its absence would never have found access to the region. The bunch-grass par excellence is the little blue stem (Andropogon •eopmrius), but associated with it are others, such as sand grass (Cala - movilfa longifolia), and needle grass (Stipa comata). Andropogon sco - parius is the dominant species throughout the region, the other species being present only occasionally. It is the little blue stem that gives the first greenish hue to the sand hill landscape in the spring, and it is the same species that clothes the hills with the rich reddish-purple in the autumn and through the winter. Hall's blue stem (Andropogon ballii), common on the upper slopes of the hills and the tops of ridges, is usually of secondary importance. Its few tall whitish or Bluish stems in poorly defined bunches are, however, conspicuous wherever they are found. Within the bunch-grass association there are a number of secondary types that are quite well defined. But as one views the vegetation of the Sand Hills in a general way these are lost in the great monotony of the bunch-grass association. However, the vegetation and general life conditions of the uplands, the home of the bunch-grasses, are very notice - ably different from those characters on the river flats or in the wet val - leys. The exposure to both the drying and the mechanical effects of the wind is most keenly felt on the uplands, composed of the hill tops and upper slopes. Sometimes the wind sweeps over the crests of the hills with such terrific force that one can not stand in its path and endure the sting of the sand blast. During a bright day with a high temperature and such a wind, life on the hills is well nigh impossible. During the hottest days of summer the surface sand in such situations is frequently heated to a temperature of 140° F. Such condition with a low water content of the soil and a high saturation deficit are the factors tliat plants must meet. One can not but admire the vegetation that possesses the power of successfully resisting such a combination of conditions. </seg>
            <seg id="p279">279 » That Sand Hill vegetation has been very successful in meeting thoao conditions is fully attested by a glance at the region as we find it to - day and a comparison with the dismal waste of bare sand dunes that once wandered over this same area. Aside from the bunch-grasses, the most characteristic plant of the uplands is the soap weed or dagger weed (Yucca glauca) which often oc - curs in great abundance on the upper slopes. In certain portions of the region over restricted areas this species really becomes dominant and the bunch-grasses then play only a subordinate part in the floral cover - ing. The dagger weed reaches its best development on the south and west exposures, although it is by no means confined to these slopes. The sand is often blown away from the roots for many inches beneath k rosette of bristling leaves, and yet the plant continues to thrive, uently it puts out new shoots from the exposed roots and develops rosettes of leaves beneath the old. frhe so-called "cat steps" formed on steep slopes in the Sand Hills their origin to the grazing habits of cattle and very frequently to presence of dagger weeds. On such slopes the cattle, avoiding the sharp -pointed leaves of the Yucca, follow angling paths which eventually become netted and worn into the sand in such a way as to cover the hillside with a network of trails. Clumps of dagger weed often fill in the more or less diamond shaped meshes of this network. From a dis - tance, such a slope bears a close resemblance to the "cat steps" so com - monly seen on steep slopes in the loess region. The origin is, however, very different. One may find in the Sand Hills a great many stages in the development of these netted trails. They are not necessarily always associated with the dagger weed, since they also occur on slopes with bunch-grasses only. Like the little blue steam, the dagger weed has little value in the region aside from its interesting and important role in the life history of the ridges and slopes. Some economic value is attached to it in that it is eaten by cattle to a slight degree. Especially when the plant is in bloom, if the range is rather short, stock frequently strip every juicy flower from the large spike or panicle, sometimes even eating the axis well down among the needle-tipped leaves. I have seen them attack the ybung capsules when the range is especially short, so that in a closely grazed pasture one seldom finds a single fruit of the species. Beside the bunch-grasses and the dagger weed there are many other species that occur in greater or lesser frequency in the bunch-grass as - sociation. The hairlike eragrostis (Eragrostis trichodes) is an important secondary grass of the uplands that frequently shows the bunch-grass habit. So also Indian millet (Oryzopsis cuspidata), and the black grama grass (Bouteloua hirsuta) are quite commonly seen in the intervals be - tween the bunch-grasses. In fact there are more than one hundred species of grasses alone in the Sand Hills, many of which are confined to the uplands. Besides the species already mentioned the following are other common associates of the bunch-grasses; Annual eriogonum </seg>
            <seg id="p280">280 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIKTY Eriogonum annuum) which, with its Blender, gray flowering sterna and conspicuous flat-topped clusters of flowers, occurs as widely scattered individuals here and there, or may occasionally form rather dense com - munities; spiderwort (Tradescantia virginica), tufted hymenopappus (Hymenopappus filifolius), purple blazing star (Lacinaria squarrosa), lance-leaved psoralea (Psoralea lanceolata), western thistle (Carduus plattensisi, rough sunflower (Helianthus scaberrimus), prickly poppy (Argemone intermedia), painted pod (Phaca longifolia), green milkweed (Acerates virdiflora), switch grass (Panicum virgatum), prairie pink (Lygodesniia juncea), Geyer's spurge (Euphorbia geyeri), yellow evening primrose (Oenothera rhombipetala), sweet pea (Lathyrus ornatus), and hairy golden aster (Chrysopsis villosa). All of these plants occur as scattered individuals except the painted pod and prairie pink, which are often gregarious. They all show striking anatomical characters that doubtless aid in their survival in such dry soils, exposed to such trying climatic conditions. In addition to the grasses and the common herbaceous associates the vegetation of the upland is rich in species of low shrubs. In many restricted localities these under-shrubs compose the bulk of the vegeta - tion and really rival the bunch-grasses in dominance. Among these low, much branched, woody plants, New Jersey tea (Ceanothus ovatus), Bessey's sand cherry (Prunus Besseyi), poison ivy (Rhus radicans), and the prairie clovers (Kuhnistera purpurea, K. villosa, and K alba) are among the commonest and most widely distributed. All of these plants are dwarfed, much branched shrubs often growing in communities. New Jersey tea is found most frequently near the tops of the hills on north facing slopes, where the dense, light green patches from ten to seventy feet across contrast very greatly with the surrounding bunch - grass vegetation. Bessey's sand cherry is one of the most ubiquitous plants of the whole region. It is found in almost every site of the up - lands and with its low, short twigs with tufts of glossy green leaves is seen springing from the sand on practically every hill. Very frequently it forms extensive communities. The fruit of this species Is an impor - tant food for the homesteaders in many localities. The prairie clovers seldom form well-defined communities, but they occur as more or less scattered individuals, especially on the lower slopes of the hills adjacent to the larger valleys. The most striking habitats of the uplands are the "blow-outs." Blow-outs are conical or rounded depressions of varying' depth and diameter formed by the blowing of the sand and vegetation from cer - tain spots on the upper slopes and crests of the hills. The rim of the more or less conical depression is sometimes almost circular, but it is usually irregular with a general circular outline. Since the prevailing winds of the region are from the west, and since "blow-outs" are the direct products of wind action, these peculiar structures are mostly con - fined to the west sides of the hills. The greatest number occur on the northwest-facing slope, but they range in position from northwest to </seg>
            <seg id="p281">281 and its relation to the adjacent hills. Blow-outs do not occur on all hills, nor does a single hill show more than a single blow-out, as a rule. On an exposed upper slope when the vegetation becomes broken or seriously depleted from any cause, the wind as it sweeps up the slope catches the sand and carries it over the crest of the hill a few yards farther away and deposits it upon the lee face of the hill. In this way as more and more sand is carried away and the up-rooted plants are swept on with the gale, the embryonic blow-out comes rapidly into ex - istence. At this early stage it appears as an area of bare sand a few feet or yards across, over which the wind sweeps and continues to eat its way deeper and deeper into the sand. During this early stage the deep-seated roots of woody plants frequently appear strewn over the sur - face of the shallow depressions until the wind has finally eaten its way far below the point of penetration of the deepest rooted plants. At last the whole rounded or conical hill top is blown away and a deep crater is developed in its stead. The two chief factors that enable the wind to begin this work of de - struction are fire and over-grazing. Both factors frequently result in re - ducing the vegetation to a point below effective wind resistance and as soon as this is done, if the exposure be right, wind erosion begins. Nothing is quite so terrible as a prairie fire in paving the way for shift - ing sands and the development of blow-outs, since in such cases abso - lutely everything above the surface is destroyed. And so if cattle are allowed to run for too long a time over a given range the grasses are seriously reduced and the soil is tramped bare of plants for considerable distances, making it very readily possible for the wind to strike at the open sands. The effects of over-grazing are contrasted to a striking de - gree in the Sand Hills, where a fence separates the over-grazed pasture from the ungrazed range. Such sights have resulted in the enactment of grazing laws which naturally do not in all cases please the cattlemen, bat they do usually protect the range and make it more stable. When the young blow-out is no more than a foot in depth the sand begins to slide into tho depression from the sides. This sand is blown away and more continues to slide in. and in this manner the blow-out increases In area as well as in depth. These two processes continue for a number of years until, in many cases, the well-developed crater-form depression is blown out of the hill. Naturally with the increasing depth of the blow-out the direct force of the wind becomes considerably checked by the prominent rim of the crater. 3ut peculiarly enough, as the wind strikes the farther slope of the blow-out a reverse current is developed Which strikes beneath the rim and dips into the bottom of the crater. In this way a spiral wind movement is frequently developed and the wind reaches to the very bottom of the blow-out, which may now be fifty or more feet below the rim. This grinding action of the wind continaes to loosen more sand at tho sides, causing it to slip more and more into the bottom, where the wind catches it and hurls it up over the sloping </seg>
            <seg id="p282">282 NEBRASKA 8TATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. interior surface of the blow-out and out over the rim. This action is quite appropriately called the "Band mill." The action of these spiral currents are conspicuous during rather low winds as well as on very windy days. Such activity is a very important factor in hollowing the blow-outs to the greater depths. After many years of this sort of growth, blow-outs at the end of their maximum activity become enormous depressions with a rim some - times 300 to 900 feet in circumference with sides of bare sand sloping Inward at an angle of about 30 degrees to the bottom, which may be from 20 to 75 feet or more beneath the rim. In the western portion of the region where blow-outs are formed in rather low hills among the lakes the sand is removed from the interior until the water table is reached. During the years of greatest blow-out activity plants fail absolutely to gain a foothold and establish themselves in the blow-out because of the great exposure to wind and shifting sand. The combined action of a high wind, high soil temperature, excessive evaporation, and an un - stable soil in the active ftlcw-out, is a condition that plants can not sur - vive. Sooner or later, however, because the blow-out has reached such a depth that the "sand mill" becomes ineffective and the sliding sand fails to reach the bottom, certain plants appear in the bare sand of the blow-out. From this time the terrible physical conditions begin to wane and the vegetation gradually creeps up from the bottom of the blow-out and slowly becomes the master of the situation. The decadence of the Eut is traced in the development of the vegetation from these first sful invasions until the whole crater-like depression is claimed by non-grasses and their common neighbors. ■ first plants to become established in such places are certain commonly called "blow-out grasses." The most important of Redfield's grass (Redfieldia flexuosa) which is almost always the very first pioneer in the reclamation of the blow-out Redfieldia may be the only plant in such situations for many years. All during this time it is extending its area by undermining and binding the soil with its network of slender rhizomes. Prom these rhizomes there arise tufts of long, flexuous, narrow leaves gracefully nodding in the gentle breeze or lashing about like so many slender wires in the higher winds. Some - times in a single windstorm the Band level about these tufts may be re - duced two inches or more, but seldom are the plants uprooted. It is to the rhizome habit of propagation that Redfieldia owes its success in thus so completely capturing the blow-out The later invaders are also provided with this device, which certainly is the key to the whole situa- After Redfieldia has once taken charge of the habitat other species soon begin to wander over the rim of the blow-out and to Invade the area occupied by the first blow-out pioneer. Among the first of these early invaders we must number the spiny blow-out grass (Muhlen - bergia pungens), sand grass (Calamovilfa longifolla), and the hair-like </seg>
            <seg id="p283">THE NEBRASKA SAND HILLS. 283 eragrostis (Eragrostis trichodes). From the appearance of these grasses the decline of the blow-out Is rather rapid. As these various species wan - der up the steep sides, and the force of the wind striking upon the upper slopes is reduced and the sand held from blowing, other species wander in from the bunch-grass association. If these new plants are properly provided with rhizome device like that of their predecessors they soon begin to weave themselves into the now conspicuous blow-out association. The plants that most commonly gain entrance soon after the grasses have become well established are prairie pink (Lygodesmia juncea), small-flowered psoralea (Psoralea micrantha), painted pod (Phaca longi - folia), and the hairy golden aster (Chrysopsls villosa). Indeed, some of these species may get a start in the declining blow-out almost as soon as Redfleldia. In this manner the effect of blow-out conditions are finally so far removed that the bunch-grasses enter and take possession of the area so well prepared by the pioneers in the succession. It is almost pa - thetic to find that Redfleldia, the first plant to appear in the blow-out and the plant of greatest importance in its reclamation, after struggling against severe physical conditions for so many years is also the first to disappear. It fails in the competition with the later arrivals and is hen forced to find other blow-outs in which it may continue its great work. With the development of the bunch-grasses and the resulting competitipn all of the blow-out grasses disappear, and then with the in - coming of the characteristic members of the bunch-grass association, he change from blow-out to hillside is complete. The only indications of the former history of the place are seen in the grassed-over crater which frequently persists as a characteristic form, and perhaps a few straggling clumps of the blow-out grasses lingering in the near vicinity. On the lower slopes of the hills and in the valleys many new species are encountered as the bunch-grasses of the uplands are left behind. Rather low down on the north-facing slopes one frequently finds con - spicuous associations of willows (Salix humilis) and dogwoods (Cornus stolonifera). The prairie shoestring (Amorpha canescens) also gives tone to the lower slopes in many places by its typical low-branching, ashen-colored plants closely aggregated. Even the taller shoestring (Amorpha fruticosa) occasionally wanders from its usual habitat In the moist valley and is found on north slopes among the willows and dog - woods. The presence of such plants always indicates a higher percent - age of soil moisture quite near the surface than is found typically In the bunch-grass association. The explanation of this phenomenon is not hard to find, because such associations and such soil conditions almost always mark an outcrop of clay or other impermeable rock strata which lead the ground water from under the hills in a horizontal direction until it is brought near the surface. If the clay or rock does not actually ap - pear on the surface it Is usually found a few feet beneath, so that the effect is practically as has been given. The water is frequently bo </seg>

This results In the develop - ment of a soggy soil where one finds such moisture-loving plants aa marsh mint (Stacbys palustris), Solomon's seal (Vagnera stellata), heal all (Prunella vulgaris), long-bracted orchid (Coeloglossum bracteatum) , rush (Juncus balticus), liverwort (Marchantia polymorpha), mosses (Bryum sp.), etc. The cow tracks are frequently filled with filamentous algae and free-swimming animals such as Euglena. The willow thickets, although quite striking structures on the lower slopes, are still well within the bunch-grass association. But as one gets down into the valleys proper the bunch-grasses, and also many of their associates, are left behind. There are two quite distinct types of valleys in the Sand Hills. Thr- dry valleys are relatively short and narrow and with a good covering of grasses which often form a close sod, but with no standing water. The well-developed sod is a condition that causes the vegetation of the valleys to be distinct in appearance from that of the uplands, with the tufted appearance of the bunch-grass association. Such dry valleys are very common in many portions of the Sand Hills. They yield an abundant crop of fine hay during moist seasons and often afford very fine forage because of the presence of buffalo grass (Bulbilis dactyloides), and grama grass (Bouteloua oligostachya) in considerable quantity. The soil of these valleys is not so sandy as the uplands. This with the water table nearer the surface makes possible the culture of certain agricultural crops, if the proper care is taken to prevent the soil from blowing. When the sod is broken in a dry valley where a consid - erable area of nearly flat soil is exposed to the wind, the blowing soil frequently prevents the growth of field crops or any other plants. The flora of the dry valleys is very similar to that of the prairie regions of the state, being especially rich in grasses. The principal widely distributed plants of the dry valley are: switch grass (Panlcum virgatum), wheat grass (Agropyrum pseudo-repens), blue Joint grass (Calamagrostis canadensis), wild rye grass (Elymua canadensis), red top (Agrostis alba), tickle grass (Agrostis hiemalis), rattlesnake grass (Panicularia americana), and a number of sedges. All of these species are valuable forage plants and they are all included in most of the hay that is put up from the valleys. Besides these economic plants there are many other herbaceous members of the prairie flora that have wandered into the Sand Hills and have found congenial homes in these dry valleys. The river flats properly belong to the dry valley type, since here we find a soil free from surface water and with all of the above species of plants often growing in profusion. These low flat areas extend from the banks of the river back sometimes several hundred yards to the bases of the hills. These flats or "benches" are well developed- along the Middle Loup River. The river winds across the flats in a very irregu - lar course, sometimes cutting close to the hills on one side and then shooting across to the hills on the opposite side of the flat. On these flats and along the bank close to the stream occur the most of the trees of the region. Thickets of plum (Prunus americana), and cherry (Prunus </seg>
            <seg id="p285">THE NEBRASKA SAND BILLS. 285 melanocarpa), several acres in extent are common in such places. Green ash (Fraxinus lanceolbta), cottonwood (Populus sargentii) and willow (Salix nigra, 3. longifolia) also thrive on this soil. In the plum thickets near the river the vegetation often becomes so dense that It is almost impossible to penetrate to the river's edge. The soil in these places is very rich and moist, so that many species of the shade plants of moist rich woodlands find in such thickets very favorable conditions. On the open areas of the river flats buffalo grass and grama grass constitute the best forage known in the Sand Hills. These low, sod-forming grasse* are especially valuable as winter forage. Wet valleys are very common in the northern portion of the Sand Hill region, where the valleys are usually broad and long. The water table is near the surface in these valleys, so that the soil in many places is very wet and swampy. There are in this portion of the hills many gradations from the moderately dry hay valley through wet meadow val - leys to valleys with large ponds or lakes. Hundreds of lakes occur in such situations throughout the northern half of the Sand Hill region. There have been two general kinds of wet meadows distinguished. The rush-meadow type is characterized by the presence of a number of rushes (Juncus tenuis and J. nodosus), and bulrush (Scirpus atrovirens and S. americanus). With these occur a few moisture-loving grasses, such aa lowland rattlesnake grass (Panicularia nervata) and whorl grass (Cata - brosa aquatica). In the wet valleys along the Loup River and in Cherry County and in wet places on the river flats a second type of wet meadow is seen in the fern meadow. Shield fern (Dryopteris thelypteris) and the sensitive fern (Onoclea sensibilis) often occur in great quantities in such places with a mixture of willow herb (Epilobium lineare), St. John's wort (Hypericinn virginicim), goose grass (Galium trifidum) and marsh bell - flower (Campanula aparinoides). Frequently the ferns are so dense aa to cause considerable difficulty in walking through this type of wet meadow. There are two kinds of lakes In the Sand Hills, depending upon the amount of dissolved substances in the water, alkali lakes and fresh water lakes. It has been found that the alkalinity of the lakes varies between rather great extremes, even the freshest of the fresh-water lakes being somewhat saline. Whatever may be the cause of this gradient in alka - linity, it is an obvious fact that the degree of alkalinity exerts an influ - ence upon the vegetation. In many of the more strongly saline waters scarcely any vegetation appears, although the beach may be well clothed with rushes, sedges and salt-grasses. Frequently even the beach, many feet back from the water's edge, is so thoroughly Impregnated with salts that they crystallize over the surface. This results in an absolutely bar - ren zone. Back of that portion of the beach washed by the waves the salt-enduring plants develop very copiously. The salt-grass (Distichlis spicata) Is often controlling in such places where the low plants develop a very close tenacious sod. Beyond the belt of Bait-grasses the taller stems of other grasses, sedges and rushes make up another dis- </seg>
            <seg id="p286">286 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. tinct zone which may completely encircle the pond or lake. These plants are very dark green, so that the belts of vegetation about the saline lakes stand in marked contrast to the duller tones of the surrounding hille. Still farther back beyond the zone of tall plants the shore vegeta - tion of the saline lake passes either abruptly or gradually into the typical wet meadow vegetation. The appearance of the fresh-water lakes is quite different. First of all there is usually a wealth of submerged or half-submerged plants. Some of these lakes are literally filled with great masses of pondweeds (Potamogeton), and the water milfoil ( Myriophyllum spicatum). The bottom, in the shallower portions of such lakes, is covered with a carpet of stonewort (Chara foetida, etc.), while the stems of the submersed flowering plants are richly coated with algae of many kinds. In late summer certain of these algae become broken away from their substrata and float about on the surface of the water. During high winds at this time great quantities of these, such as the net sack (Clathrocystis aeru - ginosa), are washed on the beach in yellow green splashes. There are also many very interesting animals in the fresh-water lakes, a sponge Mac °ne of the common forms. The white, encrusted beach is absent from the fresh-water lakes, as also are the belts of salt-enduring plants. The commonest marginal plant here is the great bulrush (Scirpus lacustris). Frequently this is the only plant between the bunch-grass association of the hills and the open water of tbe lake. Sometimes other species such as cat tall (Typha latifolia), and tbe giant reed grass (Phragmites phragmites) occur in mixture with tbe bulrush, or these may now and then form separate belts. Wild rice grass (Zizania aquatica) is a common marginal or shallow - water Inhabitant of many of the lakes. This plant is about as tall as the bulrush, but because of its leafy stems it often forms much denser stands in the shallow water. When the seed is ripe every bed of wild rice is a Mecca for thousands of water fowl that live in the vicinity of the lakes. Wild ducks become so thick at times in these rich feeding grounds that the noise they make reminds one of an over-stocked barnyard. The lakes range in size from small ponds to bodies of water one and one-half miles wide by five miles long. They vary in depth from four feet to probably about fifteen. In many of the fresh water lakes the vegetation Is encroaching upon the water, so that in time all of the lakes will have disappeared and wet meadows remain. The wet meadows of to-day show this sort of an origin very plainly. Many stages in lake eradication by invading vegetation may be seen in these lake regions. Some lakes are quite free from submerged aquatic plants; others quite free from bulrushes or wild rice; others show belts of these plants about the shore; in others the bulrushes have begun to wander into the deeper water, and in still older lakes the water can not be seen because of the complete occupation by tbe bulrushes and other vegetation. The bul - rush it the commonest pioneer in this succession, and it is well fitted for this particular process. Oddly enough it is by the possession of the </seg>
            <seg id="p287">THE NEBRASKA SAND HILLS. 287 rhizome type of propagation, the very same character that fits Redfieldia for capturing the blow-out, that the bulrush is enabled to thus encroach upon the open water and finally to capture the lake. In the one case we have a species successfully eradicating a very dry, unstable habitat and in the other case a different species eradicating a very wet, stable hafcitat by identically the same means. The creeping rhizomes of the bulrush keep reaching into deeper water as the lake bottom is built up until other species are enabled to gain a hold back of the rushes. 'Thus other species follow in the wake of the bulrushes, and then come the common wet meadow species. At last the water is gone, the aquatic plants are gone, the bulrushes are gone, and the wet meadow plants have full possession of the former lake area, and perhaps the stockman now mows his hay where once was open water. The soil and climatic conditions over the Sand Hills as a whole are such as to fit this region in a peculiar manner for the grazing of im - mense herds of cattle. It is from the pursuit of this great industry that the region must always furnish its greatest returns. Thousands of cattle are annually shipped to the eastern markets from the Sand Hills. It is truly amazing to the "newcomer" to see how well the stock does upon what seems to be very meager forage. But with a well-kept range for the summer and plenty of hay for the winter the cattleman realizes a neat return from his labors. Those inhabitants who are so fortunate as to possess fertile valley land in addition to their upland range have made considerable progress along agricultural lines. The soil in many valleys is sufficiently fertile for the production of almost all of the common field and garden crops. Naturally because of the low acreage of agricultural land this industry will never reach great proportions. Alfalfa is destined to become the most important single forage crop in the Sand Hills. There are already many very good fields of this valuable plant. It is especially fitted to the soil conditions of many valleys, and when once established it resists the fury of the wind in a very encouraging manner. The suc - cess that has already been obtained by the early sowings should encour - age other settlers to try it out very carefully. Care must be taken not to sow it on land where the water table is close to the surface. I have seen fields of alfalfa actually drowned out in this semi-arid region. Enormous crops of garden vegetables may be obtained from the river flats if the gardens are so situated that the land may be irrigated from* the river — and this is possible in a great many places. There are hun - dreds of acres on flats along the I.oup River that could be made to yield high returns from truck crops. A small irrigation plant would cost but little, and the luxury of fresh vegetables would gladden the whole life of many a Sand Hill housewife who too often "digs" or "pulls" all of her garden truck from cans. EMuch has been said and written about the possibility of covering the I Hills with trees. About ten years ago the U. S. Department of culture, acting upon a suggestion from Professor Charles E. Bessey, b a preliminary examination of the region to determine if the coudi- </seg>
            <seg id="p288">288 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. ttoaa warranted aa attempt at forestation. The examination resulted in the setting aside of about 80,000 acres in the worst portion of the hills between the Middle Loup and Dismal rivers as a national forest. The flats along the Loup afforded very favorable sites for the forest nursery, and, since It was thought best to raise the stock in the hills, a permanent station was established on the south side of the Loup about two miles west of Halsey in Thomas County. In the spring of 1903 Email Jack pines were imported from Minne - sota and these were set out on the hills. During this summer the forest nursery was started and from that time the Forest Service has con - tinned to raise its own stock in its own nursery and every spring to plant thousands of trees upon the hills. Naturally there have been mistakes and failures, but after almost a decade of active operations on the Dis - mal River National Forest, one can not but marvel at the results ob - tained, if be is at all familiar with the extreme natural conditions that the government's experts have attempted to meet. The pine trees that were planted in 1903 are now about twelve feet in height and four inches in diameter. The bunch-grasses have been shaded out and a fine carpet of pine needles is beginning to accumulate beneath the green crowns of this young Sand Hill forest. So also, as I was able to demonstrate during the past summer, the temperature of air and soil, the humidity and evaporation, and the movements of the air in the vicinity of this planta - tion have been profoundly modified in comparison to those conditions in the bunch-grass association that completely surrounds these plantations. It is a most interesting and significant fact that the trees have adjusted themselves more readily to the fury of the wind on the hilltops and •Ten In the blow-outs than to the struggle with other vegetation in the molster and more protected situations. Mr. Pierce, the supervisor of the Nebraska National Forest, told me in October that eighty per cent of the trees planted in 1911 had passed through the summer drought and were making a brave effort to become permanent fixtures in the Sand Hill landscape. kTbe forest nursery established in 1903 has been enlarged from time time until now it covers about five acres. When all of the seed beds are in use the nursery can care for about four million seedlings and two million transplants. The care of the delicate seedlings requires a great amount of skill and a large force of men in order that they may be kept free from disease and develop perfectly for the planting on the hills. While it will be many years in' the future before any return will be realized from this enormous experiment of the government's, yet the ■■« r n— of the first decade certainly warrants the continuation of the experiment. It is hoped that at some distant time acres of flourishing pine trees will grace many of the hills now so completely dominated by the bunch-grass. The people of the Sand Hills are a hale and hardy lot. Their life Is a rather hard one, even if they take advantage of every comfort possible for them.

They found that the glowing tales of the wealth of the region were mostly florid falsehoods and that they were in a strange land whose productivity was not at all apparent and the rigors of whose climate were at times most severe. Many of these early homesteaders used up all of their capital in getting into the Sand Hills. Once there their disappointment was keen, but they could not return. They settled on the one-hundred-and-sixty acre homestead, and during the first winter lived in a miserable unhom like dugout. In such a condition, poorly clad, without coal or other fu in quantity, they braved that first terrible winter with its Icy blizzard the spring coming barely in time to save them from an agonizing death The next summer perhaps they built a small sod house into which wer moved the few belongings, and then they began to map out plans fo their future existence. There were neighbors in equally straitened ci cumstances, but after a while it was found possible to buy a few cattl and in this way a permanent livelihood was assured, and the foundation were laid for what is now one of the most important industries of the state. The population of the Sand Hills is widely scattered. One may ride for twenty or thirty miles in almost any part of the hills and not see more than one or two homes, and frequently in such a ride he may not see a single home or meet a single person. The lack of human associates together with the monotony of the landscape and the slow routine of the lonesome day, the parching winds of summer, the call of the range, and the crimping blasts of winter, has left a telling imprint upon the homesteader and has made him a grizzled, fearless man. Far from the Influence of the laws and the morals of civilization, he constructed hiB own statutes and his own code of morals. There were few entries here, but woe to him of the hills who lived not the life of an open book. "A square deal for all" was the motto that the knights of this grassy king - dom wrote across their breasts. If a horse disappeared from the corral a hurried call was sent forth and a small mounted committee was soon scouring the hills. If the wrong man was found riding away astride the missing animal, he was jerked down, tried before this quickly constructed bunch-grass court, found guilty of horse stealing and was speedily strung up to a tree with a lariat rope, long before a single juryman could be summoned in a region possessed of a "higher standard of ethics and a solemn regard for the law." Such was justice on the range, especially in the earlier days. Even in this late day the dove of peace does not nest in all the nooks of this great sand-hill domain. There is romance and chivalry of the real western sort in abundance. Only a few weeks ago four stalwart sons of the hills were sent to the state prison for life be - cause of a deed that they thought was merely chivalrous. They went to the ranch house of a neighbor one night, took him from his bed, threw a rope over his head and pulled him up to a telephone pole. They had not intended to take the man's life, but simply sought to intimidate him </seg>

He was allowed to dangle at the end of the lariat from the telephone pole too long, and as a consequence the four young men are in prison for the rest of their days. From these statements the reader must not infer that life in the Sand Hills is dangerous or even uncongenial because of man's relation to his fellows. Naturally these people have individual rights which they will protect with their lives, but to one who "lives in the open," no truer or more loyal friend can be found than in these men of the hills. Fru - gal, but hospitable to the extreme, they take great pleasure in the enter - tainment, in their humble way, of strangers who may chance among them. There are some localities settled by a very well educated and cul - tured people. It seems to me that the state should aid these people more than it has in solving the problems of the range. We spend thousands of dollars to aid the farmer to get more returns from the farm, but very little has been spent in the effort to improve the range in this quarter of the state and to make the ranchman's life more pleasant and productive. Many of the homesteaders in this region after struggling along for a number of years, often facing death through cold or starvation, were compelled to relinquish their claims and leave the hills. So today one may find in many places the old dilapidated "soddy" and the scrubby, straggling timber claims of those who gave up the fight. On the other hand many of those who managed to stay in the region have prospered. The sod shanty was for many years the characteristic habitation of the homesteader's family. This home was added to from time to time until a rather low, three or four-roomed house of sod with plastered walls afforded much more comfort than the old conditions. At first the roof was also made of sod, but in later years the board or tar-paper roof has been substituted for the leaky sod. Those who have gone into the hills in the past few years and have taken claims under the Kincaid act have commonly built shacks of rough boards. Many of the older residents of the Sand Hills have lived for a number of years in very comfortable frame houses with most of the conveniences of the com - mon farm house. Even the cement block has invaded the hills and now there are numerous ranches with cement block homes and round about the many other well-constructed buildings of the up-to-date ranch. Thus the development of the civilization and the architecture of the Sand Hills has passed through a number of periods in many ways as interesting and as remarkable as the evolution of the landscape and the vegeta - tion of this great pasture domain. </seg>

ENORMOUS LOSSES E Forest fires during the past fifty years have destroyed, directly and ectly, probably more timber than has been manufactured. In spite of this drain, our natural supplies of timber have been sufficient up to the present time to provide cheap lumber, a potent factor in the great Industrial development of this country- Within a decade or two, how - ever, the rapidly diminishing stands of virgin timber will make cheap lumber only a recollection. If enormous forest fire loss were unadvoid - able, we would be justified in philosophically accepting the Inevitable. But they are largely preventable, as the experience of some European countries has demonstrated, and as we ourselves are proving in gome portions of the United States. PDoes the public everywhere thoroughly comprehend the magnitude bese losses, not only the direct ones, but also those indirectly butable to forest fires. It is Inconceivable that the American peo - with all their boasted business acumen, with their well-tested pa - triotism, with their keen love for the unspoiled out-of-doors, will apathetically permit this creeping paralysis of forest destruction to con - tinue unchecked. Let us take down the ledger of our natural resources and turn to the losses by forest fires. The figures are necessarily inaccurate, but they probably do not exaggerate. We find that the average annual loss of human lives during the past half century has not been less than 70. Below that entry we read that it is estimated that the value of the timber annually destroyed has amounted, as an average, to $25,000,000. Next there is recorded that the value of the young growth which, if spared, would have grown into commercial timber, has averaged possibly $70,000,000. It is stated that not less than 32 billion feet of lumber, valued on the stump conservatively at $64,000,000, might have been produced annually on non-agricultural lands now unproductive be - cause of fires; this amount of timber would supply three-fourths of our present demand. t Another entry informs us that since, as an average, 10 million acres burned over annually; the consequent deterioration in soil fertility our natural resources is a distinct loss for which no figures are liable. The debit column also contains the strong assertion that especially in the South forest fires, more than any other factor, are responsible for the ever-increasing areas that are being eroded by soil-washing, thus rendering in the aggregate great areas permanently as unproductive as if they were sunk into the bottom of the ocean. The detritus is being Ched into the streams, thereby elevating the stream beds. This will sly eventually result, if not already operative to an appreciable extent. in rendering floods more destructive than formerly. Indeed, recent com- </seg>
            <seg id="p292">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 292 pariaon of stream flow of eight principal rivers heading in the Appa - lachian! shows that floods are increasing in frequency and duration, al - though the precipitation, as the records show, has remained normal. These rivers are only indicative of what is believed to be a common evil. While the extent of disturbance of water shed conditions has not been carefully studied, it is well known that lumbering has progressed rapidly over vast areas at the sources of these rivers. But the chief disturbance is cot so much attributed to the removal of the timber as to the unfortunate burning over of the most of the lumbered areas. An are* more or less cleared of timber would normally recover the character of the forest mat, after two or three years, but repeated fires consume the sponge-like forest floor, expose mineral soil, which becomes less friable, more impervious to moisture and subject to erosion. While a forest cover can not absorb ordinarily more than a fraction of an inch of precipitation, floods can not be avoided even with forested water sheds. But the retention for a period of even this relatively small part of the precipitation during a heavy storm ameliorates to Cue extent the intensity of the flood, and removes enormous volumes water from the "peak of the load." Forest fires, therefore, contribute to some extent, perhaps great, to the enormous losses by floods and low water to navigation, to agricul - ture, and to business in general. It is even asserted by some that the power industry in the South, capitalized at $20,000,000, is Imperiled by altering stream conditions. That the irrigation interests in the West have been injured by the denudation by fires of the mountain sides is a common belief of the ranchmen. The foresters have entered the item that forest fires that do not kill trees outright inflict injuries which retard their growth, permit de - cay fungi to become established, encourage destructive timber beetles, and cause open forests of limby trees with impaired commercial value In place of areas fully stocked producing to their capacity. We find that millions of acres of timber lands, on which great sums In taxes were annually paid into the treasuries of states, have now reverted, as worthless because of fires, to these commonwealths. Some esthetic person has entered the criticism that we Americans have despoiled our landscapes by forest fires to the extent that we are now compelled to go to Europe to enjoy the beauty of the forests. He urges us, for the highest development of our people, to conserve the natural beauties of this "Land of the Pilgrim's Pride," of which we ■Ing; to protect her "rocks and rills," her "woods and templed hills," her "mountain heights" where "freedom rings." And another person of practical bent has followed this with the statement that attractive scen - ery la worth millions of dollars annually to any state; that the esthetic value of Switzerland is worth on an average of $10,000 per square mile yearly and that we are ruining much of ours, for the time being at least, because of fires. There are pages more of the debit column and not a single entry on the credit side, but we will close the book; it is doleful reading. </seg>
            <seg id="p293">AN AWAKENING. OF PUBLIC SENTIMENT. 293 AN AWAKENING PUBLIC SENTIMENT. Walter J. Morrill, Professor of Forestry of Nebraska University. The destruction of our forests by fires had proceeded to such an alarming extent that a few years ago a well-known statesman is credited with the following prophecy. "The more study and attention I have given the matter the firmer has become my conviction that the destruction of the forests of this country by fire will be the downfall of its prosperity and progress." Recently, however, there has developed a strong public sentiment in certain portions of the country that is responsible for a vigorous curbing of the evil. After years of agitation and hesitation the federal govern - ment began in a small way to afford genuine protection to a portion of its timber lands in the West. It went further than merely enacting penalties for careless or wantonly setting forest fires. Such laws had been enacted and unenforced for many years, just as other laws that look well on the statutes, but are practically unworkable, may be found in most of the states. The federal government established national forests and employed men whose chief duty is to prevent forest fires. The usual fire warden system of most states had been and still is a failure; the fed - eral government established a fire patrol system, and here is the secret of success. During the past twenty years the national forests have been In - creased until now a considerable measure of fire protection is afforded to over 190 millions of acres, an area as great as the combined areas of New England, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Mary - land, Virginia, West Virginia, and Ohio. Within this vast do - main about 3,000 federal forest officers are employed the year around, and the number of patrolmen are somewhat increased during the summer season. They are charged with the protection of 500 billion feet of Umber worth on the stump at least 500 million dollars. This is about one-fifth of all the standing timber in the United States. Does it pay to protect this vast wealth represented in timber? The cost for fire patrol alone on the national forests last year amounted to only about 6 mills per acre; or, based on the estimated value of the tim - ber, and including the value burned, it may be likened to a premium amounting to 2*4 mills on the dollar. K.t are the fire losses without fire protection? During the past tury, practically without fire protection, the United States has an average of 2 per cent of its timbered areas. On much of this area, however, the large trees are not destroyed, but the seedlings are burned off annually. While the areas burned over In recent years are not so extensive as formerly, the values consumed probably continue to be as much as formerly. In Prussia, between 1868 and 1895 with forest fire pro - tection, only one-fiftieth of 1 per cent on the forested area burned annually, or only one-one-hundredth as great a percentage as in the United States. </seg>
            <seg id="p294">294 NEBRASKA STATE HOKTRTLT1 UAL SOCIETY. ~&gt; In 1911 on the national forests a little under .4 of 1 per cent of the total area burned over. While this percentage is nearly twice as great as more intensive methods in Prussia permitted, it is 50 times better than the estimated average during the past half century in the whole country. It is impossible, of course, to estimate the probable damage which would result in any year with no protection. The fire losses within the national forests in 1911 are estimated at $209,761 for the timber and $182,362 for the young growth and forage. Judging from the extensive old burns within the areas now embraced within the national forests the organized fire fighting machine now operating within them is yearly saving very many times its cost. STATE AND OTHER ACTIVITY. Following the example of the federal government several of the more progressive states have recently adopted somewhat similar methods of fire protection. Among these states notably are New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Maine, New Hampshire, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minne - sota, Oregon, Washington, and California. In a few of the heaviest timbered states of the Northwest from Mon - tana westward to and along the Pacific Coast, the larger private owners of timber lands have organized timber protective associations within the past few years. These associations employ patrol men and provide an organi - sation for controlling fires as soon as they break out. During the past year several very extensive owners, including some of the great railroads of the West, have placed their timbered property under the protection of these associations. The members of an association are voluntarily assessed usually from 2 to 4 cents per acre annually to pay for manning and equip - ping a force of firemen engaged for the summer season, with a few of the chief officers, mostly foresters, engaged for the whole year. THE WEEKS LAW. In order to further stimulate the movement for forest protection among all states, a section of the Weeks law, passed by Congress in 1910, provides for an appropriation of $290,000 from the federal treasury to be apportioned to qualifying states possessing watersheds of navigable streams. Like a Carnegie library gift, there is required a certain ex - penditure upon the part of the recipient, and specific terms must be com - plied with. The beneficiary states must organize an effective fire patrol and contribute a sum for its maintenance as great, at least, as that given by the federal government, which will not give more than $10,000 to any one state during a single year. With this federal assistance and with the cooperation of the larger owners of timberlands, many states could, with a state appropriation amounting to 1 cent per acre of timbered lands, effect a fairly good sys - tem of fire patrol, which would annually save many times its cost of main - tenance. </seg>
