            <seg id="p005">SUMMARY 1. In a study of the reserve food content of small grain seeds, the term "sprout value" has been assigned to the moisture-free weight of the maximum plant growth derived from the seed when planted and grown in a nonnutritive quartz medium and in absolute darkness. Under these conditions, no photosynthesis nor intake of soil solutes is possible, and the moisture-free sub - stance of the seedling is derived from the reserve food material of the seed. 2. As an average for all the grades of wheat seed tested in 1913 and 1914, the total sprout value of the seed equaled 54.2 per cent and 46.3 per cent of the weight of seed planted in 1913 and 1914 respectively. In other words, 50.2 per cent of the seed substance was recovered in the sprout as an average for the two years. The total loss of substance not recovered in either the sprout or the inert seed residue averaged 38.5 per cent during 1913 and 1914. 3. As an average for all tests during two years, 1913 and 1914, the ratios for the moisture-free weight of unselected seed to the large and small seed were respectively 100:127 and 100:85, while the ratios for the total sprout value were 100:123 and 100:88 respectively. This indicates a rather close relationship between the size of seed and its sprout value. 4. As an average for three tests, the carbon dioxide liberated from wheat seeds by respiration during fourteen days' growth in the dark in a nonnutritive medium amounted to 39.22 per cent of the original moisture-free weight of the seed. The sprout value of the same seed equaled 47.28 per cent of the original dry mat - ter of the seed. 5. Very small or shrunken wheat seeds are at a marked dis - advantage in comparison with large seeds, when planted at the unusual depth of 5 or 6 inches. 6. The separation of the mature crop of wheat, grown at the normal rate of planting, into individual plants was accompanied by an average error of 7.6 per cent. For this reason, the number of individual plants surviving from large and small seeds at harvest was not determined in these experiments. 7. The relative production of large and small seeds of wheat was determined when planted alone, and when grown in com - petition by alternating the seeds in rows planted at the normal field rate. The small seeds weighed 66 per cent as much as the large seeds and had a sprout value 68 per cent as large. The germinations of the two grades were practically equal. </seg>
            <seg id="p006">6 Nebraska Agricultural Exp. Station, Research Bui. 1 1 When planted alone, the small seeds produced 6 per cent fewer culms and in competition 18 per cent fewer culms than the large. The yield of grain was 11 per cent smaller for the small seeds planted alone, and 24 per cent smaller in competition than for the large seeds. The straw yield was 6 per cent smaller for the small seed alone, and 25 per cent smaller in competition than for the large seed. The total plant yield was 7 per cent smaller for the small seed planted alone and 25 per cent smaller in competition than for the large seed. 8. Competition between alternating plants of two wheat varieties may be very marked. Thus, in 1914, when grown at the normal rates of planting, the yields of grain, straw, total crop, and number of culms for Big Frame winter wheat were respectively 90, 88, 89, and 80 per cent as large as for the Turkey Red. But when grown in competition, the Big Frame yields were respectively only 55, 70, 67, and 68 per cent as large as for the Turkey Red. The relative competitive qualities of these two varieties were reversed in 1915, due to a great difference in climatic conditions. However, the effect of variety competition is very apparent. Planted alone, the yields of grain, straw, total crop, and number of culms for Big Frame winter wheat were respectively 82, 105, 99, and 94 per cent as large as for the Turkey Red. In competition, these Big Frame yields were respectively 120, 128, 125, and 117 per cent as large as for the Turkey Red. Similar (tho not quite so striking) results were obtained for spring wheat. These investigations suggest that competition may play a very important role in the natural improvement of cereal crops. 9. In a 2-year yield test of unselected, large, and small seeds of two winter wheat varieties, the average relative seed weights were 100, 134.6, and 86.9, with corresponding sprout values of 100, 133, and 92.3. The grain yield of the large seed was 2.3 per cent superior to the unselected seed, while the grain yield from the small seed was 3.1 per cent inferior. The 2-year average relative weights of unselected, large, and small seeds of two spring wheat varieties were respectively 100, 117.3, and 78.4, while the corresponding relative sprout values were 100, 110.4, and 71.8. With the spring wheat, the large seed outyielded the unselected for grain 11.8 per cent, while the grain yield of the small seed was 7.7 per cent inferior to the unselected seed. In these tests, the seeds were planted in equal numbers at a normal rate for the large seeds. 10. When two grades each of spring wheat and oats were space-planted to permit maximum plant development, the small </seg>
            <seg id="p007">Relation of Size of Seed and Sprout Value to Yield 7 seed compared with the large produced 80 per cent as many culms per plant, 72 per cent as high grain yield, 77 per cent as great straw yield, and 77 per cent as great total yield. In these tests, the small seeds planted averaged 52 per cent as heavy as the large. 11. In yield tests comparing large and small seeds planted both in equal numbers and equal weights at rates normal for the large seed, (1) the small seed of winter wheat yielded 4 per cent less than the large when planted in equal numbers, while the yields were equal when planted at equal weights; (2) the small seed of oats yielded 11 per cent less than the large when sown in equal numbers, and both yielded alike when equal weights of seed were used; (3) when sown in equal numbers, the small seed of spring wheat yielded 10 per cent less than the large seed, while it yielded only 1 per cent less when equal weights of seed were used; (4) as an average for all three crops, the small seed yielded J of 1 per cent less than the large when equal weights of seed were sown, and 8 per cent less when planted in equal numbers. 12. During 12 years of continuous grading of Turkey Red and Big Frame winter wheat (by means of a fanning mill), the heaviest one-fourth seed has averaged 0.4 bushel more, while the lightest one-fourth seed has yielded 0.5 bushel less than the un - selected seed. 13. As an average for 12 years' continuous use of the fanning mill, the heaviest and lightest one-fourth seed of Kherson oats have yielded respectively 0.83 bushel and 0.09 bushel more than the ungraded seed. During 8 years' continuous use of the fanning mill, the lightest one-fourth seed of American Banner oats has yielded 1.43 bushels more than the heaviest one-fourth. In a 4-year period the un - graded seed was also compared and yielded 1.6 bushels less than the light seed, while the heavy seed yielded 3.67 bushels less than the lightest seed. In this variety, the selection of the light seed evidently resulted in securing the best adapted strains within the variety. 14. From a review of 60 experiments by various investigators, regarding the relative yields of grades of small grain seeds, the following principles are indicated : (1) When space-planted to permit maximum development of the individual plants, a higher yield per plant is obtained from large than from small seed. (2) When planted in equal numbers at a rate optimum for large seed, a lower yield is obtained from small than from large seed. (3) When planted in equal weights, at a rate optimum for </seg>
            <seg id="p008">8 Nebraska Agricultural Ezp. Station, Research Bui. 11 the large seed, all three grades of seed — large, small, and un - seleoted yield equally. (4) When distinct grades of light and heavy seeds (or large and small) are obtained from a fanning mill and planted in equal volumes as with a drill set at a uniform rate, slightly smaller yields are apt to result from the light seed. The difference in favor of large or heavy seed as compared with the original un - selected seed is very slight, and probably so small as to have little practical significance. The conclusion would seem justified that the practical use of the fanning mill in seed preparation consists largely in the removal of weed seeds and trash when present. If the seed is well cleaned at the threshing machine, little further is to be gained by fanning mill grading. (6) Competition between plants from large and small seeds sown in a mixture acts to increase the relative yield from the large seeds. This suggests a natural elimination (within a mass variety) of poorly adapted types which produce unduly small or light weight seed. </seg>
            <seg id="p009">RELATION OF SIZE OF SEED AND SPROUT VALUE TO THE YIELD OF SMALL GRAIN CROPS T. A. KIEMELBACH AND C. A. HELM RESERVE FOOD OF SEEDS The food consumed by seed-producing crops in their initial growth during germination and prior to their independent existence originates in the reserve food stored either in the endosperm of the seed or in the cotyledons of the embryo plant within the seed. This reserve food is liberated by enzymatic action in the process of germination. When the roots have become established in the soil and the chlorophyll-bearing foliage has commenced development above the ground, the seedling is enabled to obtain necessary plant food material independent of reserve food within the seed. Under any conditions, the seed - lings may continue to draw upon the store of reserve food until the supply has become exhausted and merely the nonavailable seed residue remains. The actual amount of reserve food is indicated approximately by the difference in weight of the dry matter of the original seed planted and of the inert seed residues after the seedling has extracted all of the reserve food. During growth, a portion of this reserve food enters into the plant substance of the seedling. Another portion is lost alto* gether from the plant during respiration in which carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen are liberated according to the following formula: C.H iA + 6 0, - 8 CO, + 6 H,0. These two sources of loss in weight of seed substance upon germination comprise the chief diuiMwition of the reserve food content of seeds. Other sources of lomt are probably quite negligible. Duggar (1911) states that n&gt; seeds which germinate rapidly may lose, under favorable conditions, one-third of their dry weight (by respiration) during a period of 10 days, which is an average of about 8 per cent a day." That portion of the reserve food which enters into the seed - ling structure is quite accurately measurable, and for various grades of seeds is an index of the relative amounts of reserve food contents when planted under similar conditions. This por - tion is ot prime importance in plant growth and represents the Bprtjui valut ot the seeds. &lt;»&gt; </seg>

As an average for all the grades of seed tested in 1913 and 1914, the total sprout value of the seed equaled 54.2 per cent and 46.3 per cent of the weight of seed planted in 1913 and 1914 respectively. The total loss of substance not recovered in either the sprout or the inert seed residues equaled 36.3 per cent and 40.7 per cent respectively in 1913 and 1914.

LOU OF SEED MJMTANCB THRU RESPIRATION The sprout value determinations given in tablet 2 and 8 indicate that an actual loss of seed substances occurred which was not recovered in either the vegetative growth or the inert seed residue. A respiration test was made in triplicate which partially accounts for this loss. Apparatus was set up as shown in figure 5. Two hundred small plump Turkey Red wheat seeds were planted in the 20 - liter, light-proof bottle No. 1, containing a small quantity of nonnutritive quartz medium. The seed was watered with distilled water from bottle No. 2 and the air was syphoned off thru bottle No. 8. U-tubes Nos. A., A., and A, contained KOH which extracted all CO f from the air passing thru them.

            <seg id="p033">Relation of Site of Seed and Sprout Value h Yield 33 The yields of wheat durinz the 2 yean of theie test* were quite normal. The average* of all the winter wheat yield* were at the rate* of 31 and 48 bushels per acre durinz 1914 and 1915 respectively. The corresponding spring wheat yields were at the rate* of 13 and 17 bushels per acre. This was a normal difference in yield for winter and spring wheats— the former representing a well adapted, and the latter a poorly adapted crop. It is seen from the summary data in table 15 that, as an average for both winter and spring wheat during the 2 yaars, the small seed weighed 66 per cent as much as the large »eed and had a sprout value 68 per cent as great. The laboratory germination of the two grades was practically equal— the small seed germinating one per cent less as an average. Wnen planted alone, the small seed produced 6 per cent fewer culms, and in competition 18 par c?nt fewer calm* than the large seed. The yield of grain was 11 per cent smaller for the small seed planted alone and 24 per cent smaller in com - petition than for the large seed. The straw yield was 6 per cent smaller for the small seed alone and 25 per cent smaller in com - petition than for the large seed. The total plant yield was 7 per cent smaller for the small seed planted alone and 25 per cent smaller in competition than for the large seed. It is evident that, when planted alone in equal numbers, small seed was (on an average) 11 per cent and 7 per cent inferior to large seed in grain and total production, respectively. Com - petition reduced the relative yield of small seed in grain and total production 15 and 20 per cent respectively. EFFECT UPON TOTAL YIELD OF COMPETITION BETWEEN LARGE AND SMALL SEEDS The investigation reported in tables 16, 17, 18, and 19 in - dicates the effect upon total yield of wheat from planting large and small seeds of the same variety in competition. Large and small seeds of a given wheat variety were alternated in 5-row Elate 7 \ feet long. The seeds were spaced one-half inch apart by and. The two grades were also planted alone to secure the comparative yield* free from grade competition. A difference between the yield of the two grades mixed and the average yield of the two grades planted alone indicates the effect of com - petition upon total yield. This test was made with two varieties each of winter and spring wheat during 1914 and 1915. The plats were systematically distributed and were replicated 5 and 9 times for the winter and spring wheat respectively. Being of the same variety, it was not possible to distinguish and separate the </seg>

Station, Research Bui. 11 crop from each of the two distinct grades at harvest, and it was only possible to determine the combined yield when grown in competition in the same row. Table 19 summarizes the results for all varieties during; both years. The small seeds weighed 60.3 per cent as much and their sprout value was 59.2 per cent as great as for the large seed. Practically the same results were obtained from the two grades planted in competition as the average results for the two grades planted alone. It would appear that if the plants from the small seeds were at a disadvantage when grown in competition, those from the large seeds must have had an advantage of approximately the same magnitude. EFFECT OF COMPETITION BETWEEN VARIETIES Further information regarding the principle of competition between plants was obtained by growing alternate plants of two varieties of wheat and comparing the relative results with those obtained when the varieties were grown alone. Seed of approx - imately the same size were selected for each variety in order to eliminate the size of seed as a factor in the competition. Five - row nursery plats 1\ feet long were used. The plats within a test were systematically distributed and replicated 5 times each year for winter wheat and 9 times for spring wheat. The tests were duplicated with both large and small seeds. The results are given in tables 20 to 23. Because of a seasonal difference in the relative behavior of two varieties, the results for each year should be considered individually. The behavior of the varieties in plats where the seed of each was planted alone shows con - clusively that the season had different effects on the varieties in different years. Results for 191J, As an average for both the large and small seed tests with winter wheat in 1914 (table 20), in which there was practicallv no difference in size or germination of the two varieties, the following results obtained : Grown alone, the yields of grain, straw, total crop, and number of culms for Big Frame were respectively 90, 88, 89, and 80 per cent as large as for the Turkey Red. When grown in competition, these Big Frame yields were respectively only 55, 70, 67, and 68 per cent as large as for the Turkey Red. </seg>

            <seg id="p053">Relation of Size of Seed and Sprout Value to Yield 53 In general, it may be concluded from these tests that it is of vital consideration whether equal weights or equal numbers of seeds are planted in a comparison of the yields from large and small seed. For the three cereals tested, the small seed yielded on an average only $ of one per cent less than the large seed when equal weights of seed were sown. However, when planted in equal numbers, the small seed yielded an average of 8 per cent less. Planting the seed in equal weights corresponds far more nearly to farm practice than does seeding in equal numbers. RELATIVE YIELDS OF SEED GRADES OF WHEAT AND OATS AS SEPARATED BY FANN1NC MILL The investigations regarding the use of the fanning mill reported in this bulletin are a continuation of earlier studies by Lyon and Montgomery at this Station prior to their removal to Cornell University. Lyon (1902) reported two years' effect from the use of the fanning mill upon the wheat yield. In 1905 Lyon reported two additional years' studies along the same line. Mont - gomery (1908) reported results with wheat and oats continued after the same plan. The tables which follow contain all of the data obtained since 1907, and have been heretofore unpublished. The separation of the wheat or oats into light and heavy seed has been accomplished by the use of a machine producing a regulated, upward wind blast. The grain was directed into this blast which carried out the lightest one-half of the seed, while the heavier seed fell against the air blast into a box below. Both grades of seed were again separated in the same manner, resulting in two grades known as the lightest one-fourth and the heaviest one-fourth. Each grade has been constantly continued in like manner. The lightest one-fourth has each year been taken from the preceding crop grown from the lightest one-fourth. In turn the heaviest one-fourth has consecutively been taken from the preceding crop grown from the heaviest one-fourth. Thus an opportunity has been afforded for an accumulative effect of the fanning process. The results for two varieties each of winter wheat and oats are given in tables 31 to 36. Wheat — The two grades of seed have been compared each year with the original unselected seed. Two varieties, Turkey Red and Big Frame, have been used in this test during a period of 12 years, 1900-1911. The wheat has been sown thruout this period with a grain drill set at the rate of 5 pecks per acre for all grades. The results are given in tables 31 and 32. </seg>

            <seg id="p057">Relation of Size of Seed and Sprout Value to Yield 57 As an average for both varieties during 12 years, the light seed has yielded 0.5 bushel less than the unselected seed, while the heavy seed has yielded 0.4 bushel more than the unselected. The average weights per bushel for crop harvested from the three grades have been 56.9, 57.5, and 57.3 pounds respectively for the unselected, heavy, and light seed. OaU — The fanning mill tests with oats seed have been con - ducted with two varieties— Kherson and American Banner. The general plan was the same as for the wheat. All grades of Kherson oats have been planted at the standard rate of 10 pecks per acre, by means of a press drill. Since American Banner is a larger seeded variety, the drill was set at 12 pecks for all grades. The Kherson oat tests have extended from 1905 to 1916, giving 12 years' results. The light seed has yielded 0.09 bushel more and the heavy seed 0.88 bushel more than the unselected seed. The avenge weight per bushel of crop harvested has been 27.9, 28.6, and 27.4 pounds respectively for the unselected, heavy, and light grades. The tests with American Banner oats have continued since 1909. The unselected seed has been included only since 1913. The yields indicate that this variety was to begin with a mix - ture of types. The crop from the light seed has also been slightly earlier during each of the put 4 years -the average time of heading being 2 days earlier than for the crop from the heavy seed. As a result of the fanning mill separation, the lightest one - fourth of the seed has produced 1.48 bushels greater yield than the heavy seed as an average for 8 years. During the last 4 years in which the original unselected seed was also grown, the light seed has yielded 3.67 bushels more than the heavy seed, and 1.6 bushels more than the original unselected seed. The average respective weights per bushel for the crop harvested from the unselected, heavy, and light seed have been 26.6, 24.5, and 25.5 pounds. To sum up, the superiority in yield of heavy seed over the unselected seed has been 0.8.1 bushel per acre for Turkey Red winter wheat and 1 bushel for Kherson oats. On the other hand, the heavy seed of Dig Frame wheat has yielded 0.2 bushel less than the original unselected teed, and for American Manner oats the heavy seed has yielded 2.07 bushels less. The lightest one-fourth of the Turkey Red and of the Big Frame seed have yielded respectively 0.7 bushel more and 1.6 bushels less than the unselected seed. The lightest one-fourth Kherson oats yielded 0.09 bushel more than the unselected seed, while the light American Manner yielded 1.6 bushels more than the unselected seed. As the result </seg>

(c) When planted in equal weight*, at a rate optimum for the large teed, all three grade*— large, small, and unnelected yield equally. As an average for all investigations, large and small seed yielded alike, and the unselected seed yielded 1 per cent more than the large. This also seems to be a matter of rate planting. The shortage in yield of plants from small seeds is ovtrcomt by planting a greater number of seeds. (d) When light and heavy seeds (or large and small) obtained from a fanning mill are planted in eoual volumes as with a drill set at a uniform rate, slightly smaller yields are apt to result from the small seed. As an average for all investigations, this difference amounts to 4 per cent. The difference in favor of large or heavy seed as compared with the original unselected seed is very slight, and probably so small as to have little practical significance. As an average for all tests it amounts to 2 per cent I M UtA II 9'B Iff W^#UV» Y'r»\l'0rMml I'tr urnl i WtnUf wIm»1 Klmm*t**h. T. A. If 17 2 100 N* o»u UimUtimwry.KM i»IZ] I IM W Av IM »t </seg>
            <seg id="p070">70 Nebraska Agricultural Exp. Station, Research Bui. 11 increased yield for the large or heavy seed. Two per cent could easily be interpreted as experimental error if the tests were not so consistent in their indications. It is not likely that the yields are absolutely accurate. The conclusion would seem justified that the practical use of the fanning mill in seed preparation is to remove weed seeds and trash, when present. If the seed is well cleaned at the threshing machine, little further is to be gained by fanning mill grading. (e) When large and small seeds are alternated in the row at the normal planting rate and grown thus in competition, plants from the small seeds are reduced in relative yield as a result of the competition. As an average for the two tests bearing on this point, this competition in favor of the large seed amounts to 13 per cent. This suggests a natural elimination (within a mass variety) of poorly adapted types, which produce unduly small or light-weight seed. </seg>
