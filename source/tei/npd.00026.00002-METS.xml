            <seg id="p009">(iKXERAL REVJEW ORGANIZATION. IThe twenty-ninth session of the Nebraska legislature submitted following amendment to the state constitution which was adopted opular vote at the election held on November 6, 1906: K "There shall be a State Railway Commission, consisting of three ibers, who shall be first elected at the general election in 1906, 8e terms of office, except those chosen at the first election under provision, shall be six years, and whose compensation shall be fixed he legislature. Of the three Commissioners first elected, the one receiving the highest number of votes shall hold his office for six years, the next highest four years, and the lowest two years. The powers and duties of such Commission shall include the regulation of rates, service and general control of common carriers as the legislature may provide by law. But in the absence of specific legislation, the Commission shall exercise the powers and perform the duties enumerated in this pro - vision." §At the same election H. J. Winnett of Lincoln was chosen Railway missioner for six years, Robert Cowell of Omaha for four years, and Williams of Pierce for two years. Acting under a resolution adopted by the legislature, the Attorney General on January 14. INT, commenced an action in i/«» inimiuto before the Supreme Court to test the validity of the constitutional amendment creating the Commission, and the election of H. J. Winnett, Robert Cowell and J. A. Williams as Commissioners, and their qualifica - tions to fill such offlc?s. M. B. Reese and C. O. Whedon were employed by the Commissioners-elect to defend the suit, and on February 21, 1907, judgment was rendered to the effect that the amendment had been regularly adopted, that the election of the respondents was legal and that they were fully qualified to perform the duties of State Rail - way Commissioners. (See Part V.) The legal status of the Cora - rolaeion was thus definitely established at the outset. </seg>
            <seg id="p010">10 FIRST ANNUAL REPORT Robert Cowell resigned April 4, 1907, and Henry T. Clarke, Jr., was appointed by the Governor in his stead. Mr. Clarke was elected November 5, 1907, to complete the term. I House Roll No. 305, otherwise known as the Railway Commission (Part VII). having passed both houses of the legislature and re - ed the approval of the Governor on March 27, 1907, the Commission - met in Lincoln April 9, 1907, and organized by the election of H. J. inett as chairman, Clark Perkins secretary, U. G. Powell rate clerk C. W. Crosthwaite reporter. Mr. Crosthwaite stmsequently re - ied and was succeeded by Mrs. Gertrude C. Wells. Much time was consumed during the first year of the Commission's existence by the formulation of a system of reports, laying out routine office work, and gaining tamiliarity with technical details of railroad, express and telephone business. Most of these preliminaries have been iserl of, and the Commission feels that it has now reached a satisfactory working basis and is prepared to grapple with the im - portant problems, for which purpose it was created. That even the formative period of its existence has by no means been barren of practic - al results, the succeeding pages of this report will show. REPORTS. I In conformity with section 10664, chapter 47, Statutes of 1907, jbey), reports of all free or reduced rate transportation issued by several railroads doing business in this state have been filed with Commission each month since its organization. Owing to a mis - :rstanding on the part of some of the carriers as to the scope of law, it was found necessary on May 13, 1907, to issue general r No. 2 (Part III), since which time the Commission has reason elieve that these reports have been complete and in full compliance . the law. A number of suits have been brought for the pu: nforcing the Commission's interpretation of the anti-pass law, re - nee to which will be found under the sub-head "Litigation," Part id that interpretation was sustained by a Supreme Court dec ntly rendered in the case of State r. David T. Martyv. (Part V i In order to keep in touch with conditions on the several railroads, it was early decided to require a system of monthly reports showing the volume of business, both freight and passenger, transacted at every station in the state (general order No. 3, Part III); also a system of reports showing the car situation on every division for a certain twenty-four hour period each week (general order No. 4. Fart III.) The car reports have been of great assistance to the Com - mission in dealing with complaints arising from unsatisfactory car •ervlce. while the station reports promise to prove of even greater </seg>
            <seg id="p011">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 11 value in the solution of rate problems. These reports are also useful in disclosing the volume and character of business transaotei at any particular station or line, upon which showing a fair judgment can be reached ir. ordering additional 'facilities or service. Some interesting comparisons and deductions from the former will bt found in the statistical section of this report. I Since April, 1908. express companies have been required to make thly reports to the Commission, showing in detail the amount of ness transacted and expense incurred at each station in the state, aeral order No. 12. Part Till. These reports are being used to the t advantage of the state by the Attorney General in his suit before Supreme Court to continue the enforcement of the Sibley act. which iced express rates twenty-five per cent. The forms of annual report required from steam railroads and express companies by the Interstate Commerce Commission have been adopted with such supplementary features as were necessary to comply with the Nebraska law, and are the basis of most of the statistical data found in Part V of this report. While the records of many car - riers had not been kept in such a manner as to enable them to furnish all the information required by law for the year ending June 30, 1907, no essential features were omittel and all readily changed their ac - counting methods so as to conform to the law in their reports for the succeeding year. Small telephone companies which maintained no complete records are now the chief source of trouble in this respect. I'KOCKIKRK. Procedure before the Commission is simple. Complaints may be made either formally or informally. I An informal complaint is a written statement alleging an abuse, rimination or other cause of action against a common carrier setting forth all materiail facts in connection therewith, ipt of such complaint, usually in the form of an ordinary letter, espondence is opened with the proper department of the offending pany and efforts are made to secure a satisfactory adjustment, i efforts are generally successful and it is seldom necessary to re - to other methods. Formal complaints are filed usually after informal proceedings have failed. A formal complaint must set out the facts claimed a* constituting a violation of the law and must be verified by the com - plainant under oath. A copy is served upon the defendent and fifteen days is ordinarily given for the complaint to be satisfied or answered in writing. If the latter course is chosen, a time for bearing Is assigned </seg>

AI'I'LH ATIOXS. {Subdivision c, section 1 .1 of the railway Cammission Act pro - s that no rate, schedule or classification can be changed by any vay company or common carrier until application has been made to Railway Commission and permission had for that purpose. As a It of this provision, several hundred requests for authority to ige rates have been granted as special orders. In addition, forty - t applications requiring more than ordinary attention have been , of which 22 have been denied, 10 granted, I partially granted, ithdrawn, and 7 are still pending. I Illustrative of the value of the statutory provision referred to ve may be cited an attempt by the railroads during the summer 1907 to increase the minimum charge on small freight shipments ni twenty-five to forty cents. This was prevented by the Com - sion, although the increased rate was made effective in adjoining :es and on interstate traffic. More detailed information in regard to complaints, applications and special orders will be found in Parts II and III of this report. </seg>
            <seg id="p014">14 FIRST ANNUAL REPORT INVESTIGATION!*. Many complaints and applications have required thorough and painstaking investigation on the part of the Commission. Even before its organization, in accordance with a resolution of the legis - lature, the car situation in Nebraska was investigated for the twenty - four hour period ending four o'clock p. m. March 5, 1907, which indicated a serious shortage — orders for 1,764 cars having been placed in excess of the ability of the railroads to supply them. The Commission was assisted in this investigation by U. G. Powell, sub - sequently appointed rate clerk, and from the facts then developed wag devised the system of car reports previously referred to. The power conferred upon the Commission by law to call for reports from common carriers, and to examine the original books and papers when deemed advisable, has been freely used. The data thus secured has not only been of inestimable value to the Commis - sion in passing upon problems involving rates, service, etc., but has been of great assistance to the legal department of the state in defending and enforcing laws passed by the last legislature. This is particularly true with reference to the Sibley express rate law, the anti-pass law and the anti-discrimination law. Public hearings have been held by the Commission upon its own motion for the consideration of various rate propositions as follows: May 14, 1907 — Rates on commodities affected by the Aldrich bill. July 23, 1907 — Express rates. September 9, 10, 11, 1907 — Grain rates March 17, 1908 — Fruit rates. March 24, April 27, May 19, 20, 1908 — General investigation of merchandise and commodity tariffs, involving comparison of the straight distance principle with present system of making lower schedules to job - bing and distributing centers than between non- jobbing and non-distributing points. PE the series of meetings last mentioned, committees repre - several branches of service on the various railroads of the 1 for and were given an opportunity to show cause why es should not be further reduced.

            <seg id="p015">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION" 15 Commission against Union Pacific Railroad Company, alleging that the defendant company charged a blanket rate of |4.50 per ton on lump coal from Rock Springs, Wyoming, and $3.50 per ton on lump coal from Hanna. Wyoming, to all points on its line in Nebraska, re - gardless of distance from the mines; that such rates were unjust and unreasonable as compared with rates charged to other points of equal or greater distance from the mines; that a submitted schedule of rates from Rock Springs, Wyoming, to various Nebraska points, ranging from $2.00 to $2.75 on slack, $2.25 to $3.00 an pea, and $2.50 to $3.50 on lump and egg. and from Hanna, Wyoming, to various Nebraska points ranging from $1.50 to $2.25 on slack, $1.75 to $2.50 on pea and ' to $2.75 on lump and egg, was just and reasonable, and praying for an order to compel defendant to establish and maintain the same. I Testimony was taken before Special Examiner Marble at Lincoln December 16, 1907, and the case was argued before the Interstate nmerce Commission at Washington, D. C, on February 29, 1908. I On April 6, 1908, an order was entered by the Interstate Com - ?e Commission notifying and requiring the defendant Union Pacific road Company to cease and desist on or before June 1, 1908, i charging, demanding, collecting or receiving for the transpor - •n of lump coal in carloads the rates of $4.30 per ton from Rock ngs.

I Proceed ing on this decision as a basis, the Commission demanded the I'nion Pacific and Burlington roads that they reduce their •s on coal from other Wyoming and Colorado mines to Nebraska its in conformity therewith, and the roads compiled without com - ing the Commission to resort again to the federal Commission relief. t Another complaint was filed with the Interstate Commerce Com - lon on January 21, 1908, alleging that the Missouri Pacific Rail- Company maintained an unjust schedule of grain rates from various ts on its lines in Nebraska to St. Louis, and reductions were asked as follows: Wheat Corn (Cents per cwt. ) (Cents per cwt. ) Present Proposed Present Proposed EL Louis from .

Section 2 provides that "the secretary shall charge such fees for furnishing a transcript as are allowed by law on appeal from the district court to the Supreme Court of the state, and shall turn •aid fees into the general fund provided for the expenses of said Commission.'' Although it was evidently the intention of the framers of the act that this money should be used by the Commission in defraying its general expenses, there is a very grave question whether this can be done until specifically appropriated for that purpose by the succeed - ing legislature. The entire expense fund of the Commission might thus be consumed by the preparation of transcripts for which re - gular court rates were received, and yet be unreplenished under a possible construction of the existing statute. During the past two .years $1,044.37 has been expended by the Commission for this pur - pose, in return for which expenditure $2,838.35 has been turned into the state treasury. Provision should be made that any moneys le general expenses of the office are classified as follows: Postage Printing Typewriters, adding machine, supplies and repairs Telephone and telegraph Furniture Traveling Transcripts Maps Legal services, expert examinations and court costs Miscellaneous services and supplies $ 574.01 1,185.70 746.15 314.81 974.16 1,196.84 1,044.37 1,236.01 275.97 1,128.25 Total $8,676.27 </seg>
            <seg id="p023">-NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 23 •covered into the treasury as fees collected by this department, be Appropriated for the use of the department in addition to other appro - priations. 2. Section 2, subdivision i, authorizes the Commission "to ex - amine into and inspect, from time to time, the condition of each rail - way company or common carrier, its equipment, and the manner of its conduct and management with regard to the public safety and conven - ience in the state," etc. The Commission has responded to several complaints relating to condition of railroad track and roadbed by making trips of inspection over the lines, but owing to lack of proper facilities has been unable to make a complete tour of all lines in the state, as is evidently contemplated by the above provision. To cover the six thousand miles of railroad in this state on regularly sched - uled trains would require weeks of time and results would be prac - tically worthless, for the reason that nothing more than the most superficial examination could be made in such manner. The trips: of inspection made by the Commission have been by means of ordinary passenger and freight trains, track velocipedes, motor cars, auto - mobiles, and on foot. Regular rates for special trains, giving the class of service desired, are prohibitory, and the Commission has not deemed it proper to ask for or accept any special rates or facilities not available for all persons. Inasmuch as these trips are intended for the protection of the public generally, some provision should be included in the statute whereby track inspection may be made in a thorough and systematic manner with a minimum expenditure of both time and money. In this connection, we desire to call attention to the fact that the railroad commissions of a number of states, notably Wisconsin, Washington and Minnesota have decided that the physical valuation of railroad properties is essential to the proper performance of the duties for which they were created. While the Nebraska Commission believes that it already has power to make such physical valuation, and is firmly convinced of the necessity of euch information as a basis for the intelligent regulation of rates, it has thus far been unable to undertake the task on account of the limited appropriation made by the last legislature and lack of necessary facilities at its command. In order to perform a work of such magnitude, a staff of com - petent engineers and accountants will be needed, as well as additional expert stenographers and clerks. This, in turn, will necessitate pro - vision for additional office room, the present quarters being already seriously overcrowded. While the expense incident to the work of physical valuation will be considerable, and satisfactory results can be obtained only by making it perpetual, we are confident that the money appropriated will be well spent and that the purposes for which the Commission was created can be completely fulfilled in no other manner. </seg>
            <seg id="p024">24 FIRST ANNUAL REPORT 3. Section 2, subdivision o, should be amended to include other common carriers than railroad companies in the annual report to to* made to the Governor by the Commission. It will 'be noted that this first annual report contains statistics relating to telephone, telegraph, express and street car companies, although not specifically required by statute. i4. Section 2, item 11, requires in the annual report a statement he average amount of tonnage that can be carried over each road e etate with an engine of given power." It has been found impossible to comply with this provision for the reason that each class of engines in use on the various railroads has a specific rated tonnage for each different train division in the several operating districts of the state. As this information is carried in all possible detail in the working time tables of each of the roads and is of little or no practical value in a report of this nature, wa recommend its elimination from the requirements of the law. 5. Section 5, subdivision a, provides that when any complaint is filed with the Commission, a date shall immediatedy be fixed for hearing same and notice thereof, together with the substance of the complaint, shall be served upon the defendant. Established usages of courts of justice and of other commissions suggest the wisdom of giving an opportunity for the complaint to be satisfied or answered in writing before assigning a date for hearing. t6. Section 9, provide* that common carriers shall file reports the Commission ior the year ending June 30th on the first day le following August. Thirty days is scarcely sufficient time for illng the very extensive report required by this section. The »ncy of the law will not be curtailed if this time limit is extended sptember first. This section was apj&gt;ar-?Dt!v drawn with particular reference to railroad comparics. although it relates generally to all common carriers. The detailed information required should apply to express companies, telephone eompani-s. telegraph companies, street car com - panies, fleepin» car companies, and all other carriers within th« jurisdiction of the Commission. tltem 7 of this section, which requires a statement of "the value he roadbed, including iron and bridges, the value of rolling stock, ions, buildings, locomotives, and all other property," appears to infpossible of fulfillment. The only possible way by whioh this rmation can be secured will be through a systematic physical ration referred to elsewhere. »For annual reports of carriers, a statement of the actual cost he various items of property, as shown by the books of the com - r, is all that can reasonably be expected and should be sufficient all practical purposes. Compliance with the following items of section 9 is difficult, if not impossible: </seg>
            <seg id="p025">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 25 "12. The number of tons of freight carried on each main line, designating in separate items the local and through freight. "13. The number of tons of freight carried on each branch line, designating in separate items the local and through freight. "14. The monthly earnings for the transportation of freight and the monthly earnings for the transportation of passengers on each main line and branch line. "15. The amount of expenses incurred in running passenger trains on each main line and branch line and the amount of expenses incurred in running freight and mixed trains on each main line and branch line." I The information called for is not of sufficient value to justify retention of these items in the law. They might be profitably lanted by a series of questions calling for an apportionment of it to Nebraska for interstate business originating or terminating le state, and for business passing through the state, upon some ite and equitable basis, with provision for a proper charge against aska for expenses incurred in handling the same. tltem 20 of this section, requiring a statement of "free passe* ree tickets, and franks issued, and to whom, and what relation pient bears to road," is superfluous so far as it relates to railroad panies, for the reason that this information is given in the monthly irts provided for by the anti-pass law. It should be continued, ever, as to all other carriers. iln this connection it may be proper to say that considerable dship is imposed upon the railroad companies, and the records the Commission are unnecessarily encumbeTed, by the monthly arts of trip passes to }&gt;ona fide employees required by the anti-pass . We would suggest that this law be amended so that the rail - i companies need furnish but one list of all persons entitled under provisions to free transportation, as nearly as they may be able the beginning of the year, and that supplementary reports only required from month to month thereafter. tl.

            <seg id="p026">26 FIRST ANNUAL. REPORT 8. The grants of powers set forth in the constitutional amend - ment are full, complete and sufficiently ample to permit the Commis - sion to satisfactorily meet all the-demands made upon it by the public for relief. It has been contended in several cases submitted to the Commission, some of which, are now pending on appeal in the state and federal courts, that inasmuch as the legislature has enacted spec - ific legislation with reference to the powers and duties of the Commis - sion, the Commission is limited to the provisions of such enactments irrespective of the general provisions of the constitutional amendment. Should such, contentions receive the approval of the Supreme Court, the Commission would find itself lacking the power to exercise jurisdiction in matters of more or less importance to those immediately affected, to-wit: The power to compel railway companies to provide and maintain ( 1 ) adequate station facilities, including depots, ware - houses, sidetracks, stock yards, etc.; (2) adequate and suitable cross - ings where their lines intersect public highways; (3) transfer switches. t9. The Commission has, in the case of Samuel Katz, et at. r. . if. it O. Ky. Co. ( formal No. 4 1 ) been petitioned to declare in rates excessive, unreasonable and exorbitant, and further I to order reparation for the difference between the amount exact - ad such amount as the Commission might find to be just and nable. Subdivision d, section 2, of the Commission Act empowers the Commission to "correct abuses and prevent unjust descrimination. extortions and overcharges in rates of freight and passenger tariffs,'' etc. This provision does not specifically confer the power to order reparation, and if the Commission is dependent upon the terms of the legislative enactments for its authority, and the legislature desires it to exercise such authority, specific provision conferring same should be enacted into law. 110. The power of the Commission to fix and establish telephone telegraph rates and charges under the Commission Act has been tioned. Subdivision b, section 2, of the Commission Act provides: "Said Commission shall have the power to regulate the rates and services of, and to exercise a general control over all railroads, express companies, car companies, sleeping car companies, freight and freight line companies, and all other common carriers engaged in the transportation of freight or passengers within the state.'' tit will be noted that this provision is limited to the regulation ates and charges of "common carriers engaged in the transporta - of freight and passengers." The Commission is not advised iny decision declaring a telephone or telegraph message to be ight" within the meaning of the statute. If, as before suggested, powers of the Commission are limited to the grants conferred by Commission Act, this paragraph should be amended so as to rly confer authority for fixing and regulating rates and charges *lephone and telegraph companies. </seg>
            <seg id="p027">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 27 11. Subdivision g, section 14, makes the exceptions to the anti - discrimination clause apply exclusively to freight shipments: "Nothing in this act shall prevent the carriage, storage or handling of freight free of charge or at reduced rates for the state, or for any city, county or town government or for charitable purposes, or to and from fairs and expositions for exhibition thereat." tThe question has frequently been raised whether the legislature not Intend for these exceptions to apply to passenger, express, ihone and telegraph service as well. The Commission has trued this provision literally in all such cases. If the legislature ■ves that exception should be made to other classes of traffic as as freight, this clause should be amended accordingly. 112. Subdivision c, section 15, provides that no rate, schedule or ification can be changed until application has been made to the mission and permission had for that purpose. ■ This should be amended to also provide that no new rate, schedule classification may be made effective until approved by the Com - ision. 113. The necessity for a public weigh master has been impressed the Commission, and it is believed that such provision should ade by law. il 4. Many complaints have been made on account of delay settlement of claims for loss, damage and overcharge by railroad I express companies. Some provision should be made by law to edite the adjustment of such claims, so that, if necessary, claimant y seek recourse in a court of competent jurisdiction without un - essary delay. A law providing that all claims not acted upon within ninety days from date of filing may be investigated by the Commission in its dis - cretion, and the results of such investigation embodied in a special report which shall be open to public inspection and may be included in its next annual report, would doubtless have good effect. </seg>

FINDINGS AND ORDER. tThis cause arises on complaint of the City of Lincoln filed herein, ring that the Lincoln Traction Co., the Citizens Street Railway Co., Capital Beach and Milford Railway Co., and the Omaha, Lincoln tt trice Railway Co., are corporations engaged in the operation of et railway systems in the city of Lincoln; that their earnings are ssive and their rates are unreasonable, and praying that an order be entered directing the defendant companies to give and accept [•changeable transfers, and to sell eix tickets for a quarter and ten ets for a quarter for school children. kit is practically admitted that the Omaha, Lincoln &amp; Beatrice Rail- Co., and the Capital Beach and Milford Railway Co. are incor - ted under the steam railway act and are governed by the passenger ite under which five cents is made the minimum charge. KThe defendant, the Citizens Railway Co., filed its answer alleging it is now selling six tickets for a quarter and ten tickets for a ter to school children and signifying its willingness to give and &gt;t interchangeable transfers en a proper basis. The defendant, the Lincoln Traction Co., filed its answer denying the allegations of the complaint ' and opposing the granting of the order prayed fcr. Upon the evidence we find that the giving and receiving of interchangeable universal transfers is impracticable, and under existing conditions we believe it to be within the inhibition of 6 </seg>
            <seg id="p082">82 the fourteenth amendment to the constitution of the United States (in re universal transfers, 142 Fed. 844). iFrom the evidence it appears that the Citizens Street Railway Co. organized about two years ago and began to operate oars in Octo - 1906, and now have in operation about eight cars. It now has reen six and seven miles of completed track and an investment in struction and equipment of approximately $180,000, and inasmuch the stockholders have received no dividends and the officers no .ries, we believe it but fair that $30,000 should be added to this &gt;unt upon which they may be permitted to earn reasonable dende. kFrom the evidence it further appears that about twenty years there were several street car companies operating in the city of )ln and that in 1890 and 1891 they were all consolidated into one m known as the Lincoln Street Railway and electrified. For the purpose of purchase and electrifying the consolidated roads, first mortgage bonds in the sum of $600,000, and consoli - dated mortgage bonds in the sum of $860,000, were issued. $200,000 of preferred stock was issued and sold, $1,000,000 of common stock wm also issued, but there was no evidence to show that the company received anything of value therefor. In January, 1894, the company having defaulted in the payment of interest, it was placed in the hands of a receiver. At the time of sale, the amount due on the bonds, including in - terest, was approximately $1,860,000. I During the receivership, a committee appointed by the bond - ers effected a plan of re-organization whereby there was orized: $150,000 of bonds at 5 per cent 700,000 of preferred stock cumulative at 5 per cent 365,000 of common stock $1,215,000 total The holders of the first mortgage bonds of $600,000, on which there was $146,000 unpaid interest, received $600,000 of the pre - ferred stock. No preferred stock was issued to bondholders for ac - crued interest, but it was provided that a bonus of $500 of preferred stock would be given to those subscribing $1,000 to the new issue of bonds. Only $45,000 having been subscribed to the new bond issue, but $22,500 of preferred stock was issued as bonus. The balance of the preferred stock was left in the treasury and subsequently sold at par. Of the $366,000 of common stock issued, $215,000 was issued to the holders of the $860,000 of consolidated bonds without I The holders of the $200,000 of old preferred stock were allotted per cent of their holdings in new common stock on the payment of )0 per share of common.

I In addition to the $45,000 raised on the bonds in the re-organiza - preliminaries, the company has realized and paid into its treasury the sale of its bonds and stock approximately $195,000. I This amount together with some $315,000 surplus earnings, has put back into the property in the way of replacements, improve - s and additions. In arriving at a decision it has been necessary for this Commis sion to decide 1st. What is the amount of investment in the plant? 2nd. What are its net earnings? In so doing, we have given weight (1) to the original cost of con - struction ( 2 ) the amount expended in permanent improvements ( 3 ) the amount and market value of its stocks and bonds ( 4 ) present as com - pared with the original cost of construction ( 5 ) the probable net earn - ings under the proposed basis of rates (6) assessed valuation. From the evidence it clearly appears that the original cost, not taking into account accrued interest, was approximately $1,660,000. t According to statement of the city's expert, taken from the s, approximately $606,000 has been spent in additions and im - ements. kOn a basis of par for its bonds and preferred stock, and $150 per &gt; for its common stock, the valuation is $1,397,500. In fact there evidence tending to show a tentative offer of $1,750,000 for the »rty. tThe evidence produced as to the replacement value was very con - ng, but basing it on the cost of the Citizens Street Railway, which been recently constructed, and adding thereto the values for cinder ist, power house, real estate, material, etc., and interest on stment during time of construction, its value is $1,100,000. This esponds closely to the reproduction value fixed by its own experts, g $1,151,672. Its present value on an earning basis of 7 per , $1,750,000.

I The defendant, the Great Northern Railway Company, originally sole defendant, filed its answer denying the material allegations in the hearing and argument based its entire defense on the nd that it neither owned nor operated the said line, but alleging fact to be that said road was operated by the W'illmar &amp; Sioux i Railway Company. 1 Subsequent to the hearing and argument, all parties being pres - before the Commission, the complainant asked leave to amen 1 complaint by making the Willniar &amp; Sioux Falls Railway Coni - f a party defendant, which was granted. tThe Willmar ft Sioux Falls Railway Company subsequently filel voluntary appearance and stipulation that the evidence heretofore en on said cause against the Great Northern Company might taken and considered against the Willmar &amp; Sioux Falls Railway upany and that said cause might be considered on said evidence. The evidence shows that the Great Northern Railway Company owbs the entire capital stock of the Willmar &amp; Sioux Falls Railway Company with the exception of a few "qualifying" shares; that both companies are officered by practically the same men; that the bills of lading of the Great Northern Railway are issued for freight delivered to road at said stations; that the engines running on said line are marked Great Northern; that the station agents and train men wear Great Northern badges or insignia on their hats or uniforms; that the tariffs on file in this office are issued in the names of both the Great Northern Railway Company and the Willmar ft Sioux Falls Railway Company; that the records and reports published by the Board of Railroad Commissioners of Minnesota and South Dakota show that the road in question is operated by the Willmar &amp; Sioux Falls Railway Company. The evidence further shows that oats is the principal grain shipped from the stations on said road; -that the rate from said stations to Minne - apolis is from four to four and one-half cents per hundredweight greater than the rates to Omaha; that the Omaha market on oaU. particularly on certain grades, is more favorable than the Minneapolis market. </seg>
            <seg id="p086">86 fThe evidence further shows that the distance from South Sioux to Minneapolis over the lines of the defendant companies is about hundred miles. tThe evidence further shows that officials operating the road sed shippers permission to load the cars of the defendants with grain ned to Omaha and at the same time offered them cars for grain ned to Minneapolis; that with empty cars of the defendants stand - &gt;n the tracks, shippers of grain destined to Omaha would be delayed i five to ten days until Burlington or other foreign system cars could btained: and that by reason of said delays shippers were often un - to take advantage of the Omaha grain market. tThe Commission therefore finds that the Willmar &amp; Sioux s Railway Company operates the road in question and that it is ty of the offenses complained of in complainant's complaint.

To that part of the complaint relating particularly to the facil - ities and service furnished at the Union Station at Omaha, Nebraska, the defendant the Union Pacific Railroad Company filed its separate answer admitting the allegations of the petition in that regard, but alleging further that by reason of contracts entered into by and between itself and the other railroad companies heretofore nam^d as defendants, and the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway Com - pany, Chicago Great Western Railway Company, Illinois Central Rail - road Company, and the Wabash Railroad Company, permitting said com - panies to use the said station and facilities in connection therewith, one of the provisions ot said contract between it and the said companies be - ing to the effect that additional facilities or improvements at said Union Station can only be made upon the agreement of the Board of Managers, consisting of the general manager of each railroad named above, it had no power to make improvements or changes in connection with the said Union Station except upon direction of the said Board of Managers, and asking that the said Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway Companv, Chicago Great Western Railway Company, Illinois Central Railroad Company, and the Wabash Railroad Company be made parties de - fendant. </seg>
            <seg id="p088">88 Said request having been granted and all parties having been duly notified, a hearing was had and testimony taken. Upon the evidence the Commission finds: That the plaintiffs are corporations engaged in the business of purchasing cream and ship - ping same between points in the state cf Nebraska; that the defend - ants, Union Pacific Railroad Company, the Missouri Pacific Railway Company, the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha Railway Com - pany, the Chicago &amp; North-Western Railway Company, the Chicago Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway Company, the Pacific Express Companv and the American Express Company are common carriers doing business between points within the state of Nebraska; that the Union Station depot facilities at Omaha, Nebraska, are subject to the control of h Board of Managers composed of the general managers of the Union Pacific Railroad Company, the Chicago &amp; North-Western Railway Com - pany, the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway Company, the Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul Railway Company, the Chicago, St. Paul, Min - neapolis &amp; Omaha Railway Company, the Chicago Great Western Rail - way Company, the Missouri Pacific Railway Company, the Wabash Railroad Company, and the Illinois Central Railroad Company. I The Commission further finds that during the past year approx - itely 330,000 cans of cream have been unloaded at the Union tion at Omaha; that the facilities furnished at this point are illy inadequate and that by reason thereof the cream so shipped often been unnecessarily subjected to the action of the run in summer and cold in the winter, resulting in a serious damage to the te; that for the proper and reasonable handling of this class freight, an additional building roofed and enclosed on all sides not less than 2,000 square feet at ground floor space should lie Dished. The Commission further finds that the only means of ingress and egress to and from the depot grounds is over an incline of nine per cent, grade; that said incline is unreasonably steep and that under the conditions obtaining 'at the said station it is not unrea - sonable to require the defendant companies to construct and furnish for the use of their patrons an approach to the grounds having in incline not exceeding a four and one-half per cent, grade. The Commission further finds that even after making due allow - ance for the great increase in traffic of this character, the defendants have been negligent and have often discriminated in furnishing facilities for the proper handling and care of the same; and that U to not unreasonable, considering the perishable nature of this prod - uct, to require them to furnish proper protection for the same from the action of the sun and rain in the summer and excessive cold in the winter. The Commission further finds that in an order Issued by it which became effective November 1, 1907, defendants were required to waybill all empty cans from point of origin to poiut &lt;of destination, and inasmuch as this practice has not been in opera- </seg>
            <seg id="p089">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 89 tion a sufficient length of time to determine how satisfactory it will prove, and for the further reason that it is the custom and h.is been for a l;ng time to return the empties in which certain com - modities are carried free of charge and as published in the tariffs at owner's risk, and that the opening up of this question woui.l probably involve an investigation of considerable magnitude I discrimination in favor of this product, the Commission believ---* that it will be conservative action on its part to hold in abeyance any furthor action as to billing empties until the previous order has been fully tried and found inadequate. The Commission further finds that conditions may arise whereby this commodity may be handled with greater facility on freight trains than en passenger trains, as previously cr^ered, and that where such conditions do arise and the shipper and the carrier a?ree that the service can be improved in this way, there will be no objection on the part of the Commission to the parties interested entering inti such an agreement.

Made and entered at Lincoln, Nebraska, this 18th day of Dc cember, 1907. VEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION. Chairman. Attest: CLARK PERKINS, Secretary MINORITY OPINION. I concur in all of the majority opinion heretofore filed in this ca^e except that part relating to the billing and returning of empty cans. I It is contended by the carriers that for the purpose of encouraging stimulating the dairy industry of the state they not only put in a rate for transportation, considering the value of the product and character of the service given, but agreed to and did return the ity cane free of charge but at "owners' risk." They further claim ; this was satisfactory to the shippers of cream. While this is ted by the creamery companies, the fact that, with but one exception, then but recently, none of the carriers had issued receipts or bills iding for the return of the empty cans, and the further fact that all carriers had provided in their published tariffs that said empty cans e returned at "owners' risk," lends color to the contention of the 1ers. It further appears from the evidence that at the time the low cream rates were established the express and baggage business of tho railroads and express companies was of such small proportions that comparatively little, if any, extra, expenee or additional help was re - quired in handling and transporting the traffic offered by cream shippers (Since that time the production and shipping of cream has grown emendous propiartions. This, together with corresponding increase ;her classes of traffic, has made it necessary for the railroads anJ aes companies to provide extra equipment and help which have employed very largely, if not exclusively, in the handling of the m shipments and returning of the empty cans. The consequence been to bring forcibly to the attention of the carriers the eost of lling cream shipments and returning empty cans, which in the early » of the cream shipping business was not noticed, and could only been determined with difficulty, and then not accurately. At a recent hearing in the matter of cream rates in Nebraska the carriers admitted their inability to accurately determine the cost of transporting cream in this state, but demonstrated clearly to the Com - mission that, considering the character of the traffic offered and the service given, the terminal rates on cream then in effect, which were By H. J. WINNETT, </seg>
            <seg id="p091">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 91 afterwards equalized and incorporated in the flat distance tariff pro - mulgated by this Commission, were very low, in fact so low when compared with the rates on other commodities that they could only be sustained on the ground that they had been put in voluntarily and maintained by the carriers for a long period of years, and that the cream shippers and creamery companies, relying on the long contin - uance of these rates, had invested large sums of money which would necessarily be jeopardized by any material change in said rates. Th -' complainants herein insisted vigorously that the carriers defendants herein should be required to give them receipts or bills of lading showing the number of cans delivered for shipment and desti - nation of same, and that they were entitled to same as a matter of right and of law. The evidence offered proved conclusively that ths carriers and their agents in the returning of empty cans so offered were unnecessarily careless and negligent, even though due allowance be made for the great increase of this class of traffic. Instance after instance was proved of cans being missent, piled up at some terminal or junction i&gt;oint until found by agents of the creameries. In addition to lose of time and inconvenience thus occasioned, evidence was adduced proving an actual loss by the complainants of the cans them - selves. The complainants maintained that in compelling the carriers to furnish them bills of lading or receipts as above stated, they would thereby have a check on the carriers; also an instrument of evidence which would be conclusive in case of damages arising from misshipment or actual loss, which hitherto they had been compelled to do without: and that such an order would have a tendency to force the carriers as a matter cf business to take greater care in the shipment and protection of cream cans. Answering this proposition, the defendant carriers objected on two grounds: 1st. That the complainants were getting the service they orig - inally contracted for, to-wlt: return of empty cans at "owners' risk." t2nd. That to compel them to issue receipts or bills of lading the return of empty cans would place upon the carriers a greatly eased burden in the way of clerk hire and damage claims arising a lost or missent cans, and that the additional cost of service should be placed on a traffic already carried at too low a rate without e provision being made for a charge for such additional service. t Answering the first contention of the carriers, it is in my opinion scessary to decide whether or not such an agreement did exist, ould only affect thlcse who were parties to it, or those who, having notice, assented thereto in express terms (10045 Cobbey's Annotated utes of Nebraska, 1903, and cases cited). I The complainants hereiD, waiving whatever may have been the prac- I in the past, insist on their full rights as shippers without limitation liability on the part of the carriers, and under the law and as a tter of policy are entitled to them. </seg>
            <seg id="p092">92 FIRST ANNUAL REPORT The contention of the carriers that the relief prayed for by th»j complainants should not be granted without provision being made for an additional charge to meet the alleged increased expense resulting there - from is not germane to the issues in tbis ease. tThe question at issue is, Are the compainants entitled to a bill ding cr receipt as prayed for? For the reasons heretofore given my opinion that they undoubtedly are. I The question as to whether the carrier should be allowed additional mpense for the alleged increased service can only be properly rmined in a case submitted for that purpose. The order of this Commission fixing rates lor the transportation of cream effective November 1, 1907, provides for the returning of empty cans without further charge. The order contains nothing providing that same shall be carried at "owners' risk," and in the absence of some specific provision to that effect the common law and statutory rules placing the liability on the carriers should prevail. I The waybdlHng of the empty cans, while it may improve the service diminish the losses in handling cans, does not furnish the shipper that evidence of delivery of a shipment to the carrier to which he right entitled. Indeed, when one considers the character and immense propor - tions of this class of traffic, it becomes clear that a receipt or bill of lading Is the only satisfactory evidence of a delivery of any given ship - ment of cans to a carrier. For the above reasons I respectfully dissent to this part of the majority opinion in this case. HENRY T. CLARKE, JR., Commissioner.

To the Missouri Pacific Railway Company: It having been brought to the attention of the Nebraska Vailway Commission that the roadbed and track of your road in this state were in an unsafe and dangerous condition, the several members of this Commission did cf their own motion on the 20th, 21st and 22nd days of August, 1907, personally inspect the track and roadbed of your road between the Kansas state line and the cities of Omaha, Lincoln and Crete, Nebraska. </seg>
            <seg id="p094">94 FIRST ANNUAL REPORT The Commission finds: tThat there is an excessive number of rotten and broken ties; that e is a number of broken, defective and insecurely baited angle bars; imber of split, broken and worn rails; that in many places, partic - ly In the cuts, the track is insufficiently drained; that in many ions of the road the ties are center bound ; that in some instances roadbed drops away from the ties directly under the rails and with few exceptions 52 to 56 pound rails are used on the track thriough - the state, over which in some instances heavy equipment and age moves. The Commission recommends: That all broken and rotten ties be replaced with sound and ser - viceable ties; that all defective angle bars be replaced with perfect angle bars; that all angle bars be properly bolted and securely fastened to the ties; that all defective and worn rails be replaced with perfect rails; that all rails be securely fastened to the ties; that the track and roadbed be properly drained, particularly in the outs; that the top of the roadbed be so constructed as to extend at least twelve (12) inches from Che bottom of the ties, and so that the ties from end to end may reet firmly on the roadbed. The Commission further recommends that, until such repairs are completed, not lees than three hundred and fifty (350) men shall be employed exclusively in such work within this state by said company; Vhat the said company have its tracks properly patrolled; that the said company shall move its trains, both freight and passenger, at such a rate of speed only as is commensurate with safety to passengers and employees. I The Commission further recommends that on those portions of road on which the heaviest equipment and tonnage traffic is moved ound rails be substituted for the lighter rails new in use. kin the opinion of the Commission, 90 days is a sufficient time within h the repairs herein recommended can be reasonably expected to ade.

Secretary SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT AND ORDER I Whereas, Commissioner .1. A. Williams has made and filed finding recommendations respecting the operation of the Missouri Pacifi ■ ay in Nebraska, as follows, to-wit: "Having heard of two wrecks on the line of this company near I'nion, Nebraska, and of another near Verdcn, I hired a track veloc - ipede with gasoline engine attachment and with Rate Clerk V. G. Powell 1 went cut over the line toward Weeping Water on the morning of October 5, 1907. and proceeded along the lines of said, company in eastern Nebraska and returned to Lincoln en the evening cf the 7th. "In making this report, I understand the necessity and propriety of making it so that the situation may be clearly understood by all concerned. Some commendable efforts are being made by the M. P. Company to fix the tracks, and extra gangs of men are at work. But the serioue failure in the Mtuati n is in the fact that not any number of men can make a safe track unless they have the material that is absolutely essential. Unless the company furnish the material for ballast and furnish the ties and rails, the tracks cannot be made eafe for the heavy and speedy traffic that is being carried over these lines. The management has permitted this railroad in Nebraska to reach a status which renders necessary drastic measures in order to secure reasonable safety to the traveling public. "Aftsr a second inspection of these tracks, I have reached the conclusicn that the traffic as at present conducted over them, is unques - tionably dangerous to life and equipment. I think that until these tracks shall have been ballasted and from one-third to one-half of th&gt; ties replaced and the present light rails replaced by heavy rails, thv&gt; speed of all trains should be reduced so that no passenger train shall be run faster than twenty-five miles an hour over even the best portion - of the track, and no freight trains faster than twenty miles an hour, and no engine weighing to exceed fifty tons faster than fifteen miles an hour, and that during wet weather even such speed should not be main - tained for the reason that at such times the track becomes knocked out and this renders of no use any amount of work that may have been done on an unballasted track. I have in view the heavy engines and trains that are being run over these lines. t"I find that since my last trip over these trackr, some work has i done in the way of surfacing and a considerable number of ties ; been replaced, but a large part of the work has been of but little ng benefit because the heavy and swift traffic over the dirt [bed during the recent wet season has crushed the track out of e, has pressed the ties into the yielding material and has left rails and ties to bend and sway and sink as the heavy engines and is go over them. t"A large percentage of the cars over these lines are heavily loaded coal and they knock out any other than a heavy, solid track. And the great 'battle-ship' engine, for example, with its excessive ht, goes over the track on dirt roadbed and leaves it ready to slide. By H. J. WINNETT. </seg>

Undoubtedly the numerous wrecks and derallmeuts that have occurred but recently happened in this way. "I wish to report further that between Lincoln and Weeping Wate - some commendable work is being done. Considerable drainage work has been dene, some new ties put in, some ballasting and from Elm - wocd east, a large number of new and heavier angh-bars are being put in. There is one cut where the track is literally in the mud even in this dry weather, and from Unicn to Nebraska City, me track show* heavy wear, and in many places the roadbed has yielded to the heavv traffic which has driven the track down into the mud. "In the Nebraska City yards the roadbed and track is in bad shape. All the way to Paul the track is bad and the use of straight rails on curves is especially noticeable lure. There is a long down grade stretch with dirt ballast all the way. There are many low joints and a number of piece rails. Between Julian and Nebraska City Junction there is some cinder ballast and some stone ballast, and thus to Auburn. Some work has been done between Auburn and Howe, but still it is liable to be knocked out at any time with its dirt ballast and straight rail curves with the in-rail excessively low and many w:rn off as much as an inch and a half. From Stella to Verdon the track is below normal and gives evidence of beina; knocked out of shape by high speed. Here, too, many of the in-rails are badly worn and low. Even on curves as high as 10 per cent, the rails are laid straight and from three to four inches lower on tho inside. The wreck or derailment near Verdon occurred where the track had been newly ballasted with stcne dust, and, unsettled, could not stand the swift and heavy traffic. "Considerable ditching has been done, and this is all well and good. From Verdon to Falls City, with the exception of about three places, the track is fairly good and good track begins about three miles north of Falls City and continues to state line. "South of Falls City about a mile, heavy rails have been put in along with stone or cinder ballast, and the contrast between the track there and farther up is very striking. I "It must be stated that from Verdon to Union at least 75 per cent. be track is unfitted for speed over 25 milss an hour even in dry ;her. and quite unfit at any time for heavy and fast traffic. Even ballasted track and proper ties, the rails are not heavy enough to orm to the requirements of the heavy traffic that is being urged t this road. I found that the section men are receiving $1.50 a while extra gangs (largely Greeks) are receiving $1.75 a day might seem to prevent the best work being done, but the section are apparently doing all they possibly can with the material given l by the company. t"From Netoraeka City Junction to Talmage, the irack is largely lied with stone or cinder ballast and does not show the worn con - n that is noticeable en the line from Union to Falls City. It !s ! evident, too, that trains have not been run at such high speed on line as they have on the Union-Falls City line. K'The track from Talmage to Hickman does not seem to be knocked as on the other lines, and the excessive growth of weeds with som .-• joints and many decayed ties constitute the most striking defects his line. t Considering the light traffic on this line, it does not demand thc - t attention that is called for on the other lines. On this stretch ck we found at work fifteen section men and 'two teams. "And now, in addition to the recommendations and orders of this Commission heretofore made with respect to the requirements an i operation of the Missouri Pacific lines of railroad, I recommend that </seg>
            <seg id="p097">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 97 an order be promulgated by this Commission limiting the speed of all trains on these lines to a low degree to such an extent as to provide for reasonable safety until the tracks and roadbed can be made to bear tha traffic at the usual speed of passenger and freight trains, and that this be made especially applicable to heavy engines and heavy trains, that no passenger train be allowed to run faster than 20 to 25 miles an hour, that freight trains be limited generally to not more tTian 20 miles an hour, and that excessively heavy trains drawn by heavy engines such as the 'battle-ships' be limited to 15 miles an hour, and this speed to be reduced during wet weather. And I further recommend that the management be informed that the embargo thus placed on speed, if :t shall be so placed, will not be removed or modified until the Commission shall have become satisfied that the roadbed has been ballasted, defective ties replaced and heavy rails laid, so that reasonable safety may be secured to the traveling public." §Now, therefore, in view of the foregoing findings and reeommenda - , it is the judgment of this, the Nebraska State Railway Commission, an emergency exists, and accordingly I IT IS ORDERED that the Missouri Pacific Railway Company be and ireby is ordered and directed to re-arrange its time tables and lules for running trains over its lines in Nebraska, between Omaha, )ln, Weeping Water, Nebraska City, Auburn and Falls City and in - ediate points so that they will exhibit the time to be taken by trains een said points and to direct its train dispatchers, engineers and • agents and employees engaged in directing and running trains to luch trains over said lines at a speed not to exceed 25 miles an hour ,se of passenger trains, and not to exceed 20 miles an hour for any ht train, and not to exceed 15 miles an hour for any train drawn ae of the engines of the type known as the 'battle-ship' or of any r type of engine weighing to exceed 70 tons on the drivers, and to 3 and put into effect its time tables in accordance herewith until time as this limit on speed shall have been removed by this mission.

Billingsley, R. W. Greene and P. F. Greene for Defendants. OPINION AND ORDER OF THE COMMISSION. HENRY T. CLARKE, Jr., Commissioner This cause arises on the petition of the complainants, residents of the city of University Place, for and in their own behalf, and in behalf of other citizens of Nebraska, residents of the same place, praying that an order may be entered compelling the defendant, a carrier engaged in the transportation of passengers and freight between stations in the state of Nebraska, to erect and maintain an agency station, with the necessary sidetracks and appurtenances, on its line. In a convenient and suitable location in University Place. The defendant in its answer alleges: 1. That the matters arising under the petition herein are subject to the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of congress. ti. That the law under which the proceeding is brought is in coo - ntion of the constitution of the United States of America, and fore void. 13. That the law under which the proceeding is brought is ic ravention of the constitution of the state of Nebraska and there - void. 4. That there is no necessity for a station. tThe first two propositions are not argued in the defendant's I and will not be considered here. This Commission will, until ly determined otherwise by the Supreme Court of the United States f Nebraska, assume the legality of the constitutional amendment </seg>
            <seg id="p103">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 103 creating it, and the legislative enactments supplemental thereto, and will continue to exercise the powers hitherto conceded to state govern ments, necessary to regulate and control common carriers doing business between stations in this state. t Counsel for the defendant further insists that this Commission, er the law, has not the power to control or regulate the facilities common carrier, and in particular is without power or authority to pel the location, erection and maintenance of a new depot or station, assumes that the powers of the Commission are dependent entirely n the act passed by the legislature. The constitutional amendment creating this Commission provides: "The powers and duties of such Commission shall include the regulation of rates, service and general control of common carriers as the legislature may provide by law. But in the absence of specific legislation, the Commission shall exercise the powers and perform the duties enumerated in this section." IThat this amendment has become a part of the fundamental law of state has been finally and favorably determined by our Supreme rt. (State vs. Winnett, 110 N. W. Rep. 1113.) In our opinion, this amendment must mean one of two things: 1 First, either that this Commission has only such powers as the slature may see fit to delegate to it, same to be exercised and used uch a manner as the legislature may prescribe; or t Second, that this Commission is entrusted by the people with full complete power necessary for the regulation of rates and service, the exercise of a general control over common carriers in this state, ted only by legislative enactment as to its procedure and manner in which it shall hear and determine and enforce matters tin its jurisdiction. tlf the first contention is the correct one, what might be the It? The legislature in its wisdom, or in the heat of party strife, ht-see fit to enact specific legislation delegating to this Commission rifle powers of a trivial and unimportant nature: in fact, grant to jwers of so insignificant a character as to defeat the very purpose for ch the Commission was created. Having in mind the conditions leading up to the adoption of this amendment, and the terms of the amendment itself, vesting, in the absence of any legislation, the full powers of regulation and general con - trol of common carriers In this Commission, we are convinced that such a construction is untenable, and that the latter construction should pre - vail, and that the power of the legislature is limited to the prescribing of the manner, form and procedure under which the Commission may - exercise its power and perform its duties. That part of counsel's objection which is based on the insufficiency of the powers granted by the statute, therefore becomes immaterial. ■ That this Commission has ample authority, under the general grant power, to regulate the services and exercise a general control over </seg>
            <seg id="p104">104 FIRST ANNUAL REPORT common carriers in this state, as provided in the constitutional amend - ment, and in particular to hear and determine complaints of this character, we believe is not debatable. Within the well accepted definitions of the word "regulate," aa applied to carriers, is included the idea of controlling the "operation of the roads, prescribing the rules for the management thereof — matters which affect the convenience of the public in their use." (Ames vs. U. P. R. R. Co., 64 Fed., 178.) I If the location of depots at suitable points, without unjust dis - ination, to meet the needs and convenience of the public, is a duty h carriers owe to the public, it is properly a subject of regulation. §In the absence of statutory provision, this has been decided by ou~ t to be a duty which the common law imposed upon railroads, te ex rel vs. Republican Valley Railroad Co., 17 Neb. 647.) Iln a similar case, the Supreme Court of Louisiana, in a well con - •ed opinion (Morgan's La. &amp; T. R. &amp; S. S. Co. vs. R. R. mission, 109 La. 262), says: t"The conflicting interests between the corporations and the state safeguarded by the officers of the former on the one hand and by railroad commission on the other. The power, authority and duty he latter are not limited merely to matters affecting the public ty or the public health. They extend also to matters concerning ic comfort and public convenience, and in the consideration of mat - of comfort and convenience, the number of persons who may be con - ed in some particular manner at some particular point enter as jrtant factors in determining what is proper to be done." Counsel for the defendant insists further, that the courts have exclusive original jurisdiction in cases of this kind, and cites the case of State vs. Republican Valley R. R. Co., 77 Neb. 647, and Chicago &amp; N. W. Ry. Co. vs. State, 103 N. W. 1087, as supporting his contention. Neither of the foregoing cases, however, is in point. The case cf State vs. R. V. R. R. Co., 17 Neb. 647, was instituted before the act of 1885, creating the state board of transportation, took effect, and at the time the case of C. &amp; N. W. Ry. Co. vs. Carr, 103 N. W. 1087, was instituted and decided, no board of transportation or railway com - mission was in existence. The Supreme Court of this state has held ver, that a railroad commission, lawfully created and clothed with the power to investigate and determine the necessity for any addicion or change of station house or stations, has exclusive original jurisdiction in the premises, and that a party requiring a change, addition, or ion of a station must first apply to such Commission before the courts will grant relief. (State ex rel Moore vs. Chicago, St. P., M. ft O. R. R., 19 Neb. 476.) It appearing for the foregoing reasons that the Commission has both power and jurisdiction in the premises, the sole question to be determined is: "Does the public convenience and necessity reasonably require the granting of the relief prayed for?" </seg>
            <seg id="p105">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 105 From the evidence it appears, and the Commission so finds, that University Place is an incorporated town, having a population of between 2,500 and 3,500 inhabitants; that a university enrolling several hun - dred students, is located within its limits; that there is a considerable number of merchants maintaining business houses in said city, engaged in the business of shipping, buying and selling of drugs, groceries, hardware, lumber, coal, general merchandise, plumbing and build - ing supplies; that the main line of the defendant company passes through the northern portion of the town at a distance of about three - fourths of a mile from the center of the town; that the nearest stations on the defendant's road, or any other steam railroad, are located at Lincoln and Havelock, each at a distance from the center of Universitv Place of about four miles and one and three-fourths miles respectively; that the defendant company has constructed a switch track from its main line for a distance of about two miles to a point near the center of the city; that carload freight alone to the extent of several hundred cars a year is delivered on said switch track; that, except where compe - tition enters into the service, a switching charge of $5.00 per car *s added to the regular tariff rate to Lincoln on all carload shipments de - livered on said switch track; that no less than carload shipments are received on said switch track, and that the citizens of said city are compelled to either go to Lincoln or Havelock for such shipments, thereby causing them more or less inconvenience, and entailing con - siderable and unnecessary extra expense and loss of time. Notwithstanding these facts, defendant further resists the grant- Ing of the relief prayed for on the grounds that the cost of construction of a proper station and the necessary appurtenances thereto, together with the cost of maintenance of a station agent at that point, would exceed the profits derived therefrom, and for the further reason that ample facilities to meet the public needs and convenience are afforded by the switch track herein referred to and by a street car line running regularly between University Place and the stations at Havelock and t Counsel's contention that the original cost and expense of main - ace would exceed the profits from the railroad business done at an/ Ion that might be provided, might be true if University Place were credited with the carload business arriving over the said switch k. It is not fair, however, to a community to permit a railroad '&lt;&gt; orm only that service which is most profitable to itself without pelling it to perform its full duty to the public. I Furthermore, it is the opinion of this Commission that the entire less of the railroad done at University Place will not only pay nses, but indeed return a fair profit to the defendant. I Assuming, however, that the contention of counsel In this respect rrect, it would not be sufficient to justify the refusal of the relief ed for. It has become a well established principle of law that it is not necessary that the business done by a railroad over every portion pf its </seg>
            <seg id="p106">FIRST ANNUAL REPORT 106 road or at every point thereon should be remunerative. If the rail - road as an entirety does a business which is compensatory, it has no legal right to complain of an order of this Railroad Commission compelling It to perform a particular and specified duty necessary for the comfort and convenience of the public, even though it may entail some pecuniary lots. (Atlantic Coast Line vs. N. C. Commission, 206 U. S. 1; Morgan's La. ft T. R. ft S. S. Co. vs. R. R. Commission, 109 La. 247.) We do not concur in the conclusions of counsel for defendant that the transportation facilities afforded the complainant and his fellow citizens in University Place are sufficient to satisfactorily and reasonably supply the public need. In our opinion, under the facts presented in this case, as compared with the facts as they appear in the similar cases heretofore referred to and reported In the 109 La. 247, and the IT Nebraska 647, the petitioners have made an even stronger showing, and, following the precedent therein established, they are entitled to the relief prayed for.

            <seg id="p109">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 109 they can load direct into cars from the elevator, and in that regard complainant alleges that said defendant unjustly discriminates against complainant and in favor of the other two elevators. KThe defendant filed an answer herein in which the allegations of complainant in regard to the incorporation and business of coni - lant and defendant are admitted, but all other allegations are ed. Defendant further answers and denies to the Nebraska State Rail - way Commission jurisdiction In the premises. §On December 18, 1907, the evidence taken at the hearing on said plaint December 4, 1907, was reviewed by counsel and the matter taken under advisement by the Commission. The Commission finds that the complainant. The Manley Co-ope - rative Grain Association of Manley, Nebraska, is a company organized and doing business at Manley, Nebraska, as set forth in the complaint, and that the respondent The Missouri Pacific Railway Company is a common carrier doing business between points in Nebraska, including Manley, Nebraska; that at Manley, Nebraska, the complainant has built and maintains a grain elevator of about 18,000 bushels capacity, an1 that the same is located adjacent to the right-of-way of the respondent company and at such place as to be convenient of access from a switch - track should the same be laid along or near the edge of the right-of-waf extending along the site of said elevator; that the said The Manley Co - operative Grain Association is composed of about fifty members owning In the aggregate about 10,000 acres of farm land in the vicinity of said town of Manley; that since October, 1906. and up to the pr sent time, said complainant company has shipped from said town over the Mis - souri Pacific Railway 150,000 bushels of grain, and that about fifty per cent, of this amount was shipped from Manley, Nebraska, to Omaha. Nebraska, and that complainant is ready and able to store in its elevator large quantities of grain for shipment over said defendant's road from its said elevator, and that its ability to ship grain over said road from Its said elevator is curtailed by reason of there being no spur tracx extending along the right-of-way adjacent to said elevator, and by the fact that complainant is obliged to load its grain for shipment into wagons and then scoop the same into cars on defendant's tracks; tbat said complainant desires such spur track to its elevator to facilitate It3 shipments of grain, much of which is shipped to points wholly within the state of Nebraska, and that such spur track is a necessary facility for intra-state shipments in Nebraska from Manley, Nebraska; that said town of Manley is situated in a populous and fertile country and is of easy access from the surrounding country by reason of the nature of the roads leading to it, and that the complainant company gets a large share of the grain hauled to said town for storage and shipment. We further find that there are two other elevators at said town of Manley, Nebraska, and that there is a spur track leading to each of these elevators and connected with the tracks of said resy &lt;\d^nt </seg>
            <seg id="p110">FIRST ANNUAL REPORT 110 company, but that complainant bandies as much if not more grain than cither of the other elevators, but is being discriminated against by said respondent company and is, in the opinion of the Commission, entitled to track facilities in the way of a spur track to its elevator to facilitate its shipments of grain over defendant's railroad to Omaha and other points In Nebraska. The Commission further finds that a spur track can be constructed to extend from the south end of the spur track wliich reaches the other elevators south to a point beyond the south end of complainant's ele - vator without in any way inconveniencing the other elevators or in any way making objectionable obstruction. The Commission further finds that the extension of the spur or switch track hereinbefore designated is not only necessary to facilitate the shipment by the complainant of its property over the road of said defendant, but it is a facility in which the whole public is interested forasmuch as it serves the public by promoting the better dispatch of the business of the public through the necessary means of shipment of its products to market. The Commission further finds that the facility in the way of a spur or switch track prayed for by the complainant is a facility for the more convenient shipment of property by citizens of Nebraska between points in Nebraska over the railroad of the defendant company doing business in Nebraska, and that the subject matter of the. complaint is therefore within the jurisdiction of the Nebraska State Railway Com - mission. The Commission further finds that the complainant offered and still offers to pay the defendant company the reasonable cost of the construction of a switch track as desired by complainant, and we find that justice and equity require that complainant should pay the rea - sonable cost of the construction of such switch to its elevator. The Commission further finds that the defendant herein has failed to so arrange the gates and approaches to its stock yards at Manley as to give free access to and from the same to the general public who are engaged in the loading and unloading of stock shipped over the defendant's road; that its facilities in this regard are, therefore. Inadequate, and that an order should be made directing the defendant to so arrange its stock yard gates and approaches as to furnish to stock shippers reasonable and satisfactory ingress and egress to and from said yards from and to the public highway. ORDER. tIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Missouri Pacific Railway npany be notified and directed, and the same is hereby notified and scted, on or before January 15, 1908, to furnish in ting to the complainant herein, The Manley Co-operative .in Association, an estimate of the reasonable cost of constructing extension switch or sidetrack, from the southern end of the present 'track at Manley to a point intersecting a line extending east from </seg>

Dilworth for C. B. ft Q. R. R. Co. REPORT OF THE COMMISSION. HENRY T. CLARKE, JR., Commissioner: The above causes arise on the several petions of the York Commercial Club of York, Nebraska, asking that the defendants, the Chicago ft North-Western Railway Company, and the Chicago, Bur - lington ft Quincy Railroad Company, be required to erect and maintain at York, Nebraska, track scales of sufficient capacity to weigh car - load shipments made or received over defendant's rails. The legislature of 1907 passed "an act to require railroad com - panies to provide scales and furnish weights of commodities trans - ported by them in carload lots, and to provide a penalty for the violation thereof," known as the Ashton Bill (Session Laws of 1907, Chapter 88). The provisions of said act are as follows: "Section 1. That every person, firm or corporation engaged in operating any railroad within the state of Nebraska over which coal and other commodities in carload lots shall be transported for hire, shall equip the line of its track and thereafter maintain thereon in good order track scales of sufficient capacity to weigh a full carload of any and all kinds of merchandise, coal, grain or other property that may be transported over the said railroad, and to weigh the same at the request of any owner, consignor or consignee of said prop - erty and furnish written certificates of such weights to such owner, consignor or consignee as hereinafter provided. ■ "Section 2. Such track scales shall be so installed and maintained all division stations along the line of such railroad within the ;e of Nebraska, and at such other stations as the Stat? Railway □ mission shall from time to time direct. ("Section 3. The owner, consignor or consignee of any carload it grain, coal, merchandise or other property in course of trans - ation over any railway within the state, transporting the same - hire, may request in writing any agent of the operators of such ray to weigh any such carloads of grain, coal, merchandise or r property in course of transportation, and, upon such request g received, it shall become the duty of the operators for such rail - . to weigh the car or cars designated in such written request, ther with their contents, upon such track scales as may be piated in such written request over which such car or cars in th» </seg>

"Section 4. Whenever any carload lot of merchandise, coal, grain or other property shall be delivered for transportation for hire to any carrier by railroad within this state consigned to any person at a station on the line of the railroad of such carrier, or upon any other railroad within this state, where no track scale is located and main - tained, and such car in the course of transit will not pass a track scale en the line of such connecting carrier, it shall immediately become the duty of such initial carrier to cause the same to be weighed in the manner required by the third section of this act on the track scale located nearest the station to which such car is consigned, and to stamp upon the waybill of such car all the matters required to be set out in the certificate provided for in the third section of this act; but where ccal, grain, merchandise or other property in carload lots is consigned to stations where track scales are located, and the consignee requests the same weighed, such weight shall be taken, b th gross and tare, with the car uncoupled, on such track scales at the point of destination." I The defendants challenged the constitutionality of the act in stion, and submitted proof to show that the requirements of the stitution relating to the manner in which the legislature shall ct measures had not flfeen complied with. Defendants further sted that the power of the Commission to grant relief in the prem - depended upon the said law, and that, inasmuch as the law was constitutional, the Commission was without power to act. I This Commission is not disposed to pass upon the validity of an of the legislature, and should it feel called upon to do so, it ; necessarily be a clear and exceptional case that would justify deciding adversely to its constitutionality. § Assuming, for the purpose of argument, however, that the act in ition is unconstitutional, the Commission is of the opinion that 't ot without power to grant relief in such cases. t Subdivision b of section 2 of chapter 90, Session Laws of 1907. ides that "said Commission shall have the power to regulate the i and services of and to exercise a general control over a'l oads." The language of the constitution ie: "The powers and duties of such Commission shall include the regulation of rates, service and general control of common carriers as the legislature may provide by law. In the absence of specific legislation the Commission sha'.l exercise the powers and perform the duties enumerated in this provision " </seg>
            <seg id="p118">118 I Counsel for the defendants suggests that the constitution does confer power directly upon the Commission, but merely allows thu ilature to do so. It Is the opinion of the Commission that if such had been the intention of the framers of this portion of the constitution, that '» very different phraseology would have been used. It seems clear that this provision of the constitution creating; the Commission, in broad, general terms, empowers it to regulate the rates and services of railroads and gives it a general control over them, reserving to the legislature the right to legislate specifically oil railroad matters and to prescribe by law the manner and form in which the Commission shall proceed. Specific enactment by the legislature with reference to any specific subject for regulation or control is not a condition precedent to the Commission's assuming jurisdiction to act. But "in the absence of specific legislation," that is, if the legis - lature faile to act upon any particular subject, the Commission shall regulate the services and exercise a general control. That the maintenance of track scales for the weighing of carload shipments and the furnishing of net weights for the same, by the carriers, should properly be included as a part of the service afforded the shipping public, is a proposition too clear to require argument. The city of York is the county seat of York county, having a pop - ulation of from 5,500 to 7,000 inhabitants. It is located on the Fremont-Hastings branch of the Chicago &amp; North-Western line, and on the Stromsburg-Sutton branch line of the Burlington. There are track scales on the line o# the Burlington at Lincoln about fifty-two (52) miles from York, at Hastings about fifty (50) miles from York, and at Grand Island about forty-one (41) miles from York. On the line of the North-Western there are track scales at Hastings about forty-nine (49) miles from York, and at Fremont about seventy-one (71) miles from York. K During the year 1907 there were shipped in and out of York the Burlington one thousand, six hundred sixty-eight (1.668) cars. on the North-Western seven hundred one (701) cars. Of the ve number about eighteen (18) per cent, were coal shipments. The principal out-bound carload business from York consists of live stock, grain, flour, mill stuff and brick; the principal in-bound business of coal, lumber, building materials and agricultural im - plements. tit is the general custom and practice of buyers and sellers and the iers, when there happens to be more than one road involved is transportation of given shipments of live stock and grain, to accept ination weights. Flour and mill stuff are shipped in sacks, and nated weights which are usually correct, are used. Other modifies are waybilled to weigh at the first track scales en route, ppeared from the evidence that brick is the only out-bound car - freight originating in any quantity at York which destinates </seg>
            <seg id="p119">119 Koints between York and points where the track scale facilities afforded. Brick, however, are subject to shipment on estimate! Ms, which are usually correct. KThe complaints, as disclosed by the evidence of the witnesses, all confined to in-bound shipments, and of these almost all entirely ft coal shipments. It appeared from the evidence that until recent years ccal ship - ments were billed from the various mines to destination points at so called "mine weights," and were not weighed by the railroads or their agents unless instructed so to do by the consignee. By reason of the practice of billing at false weights obtaining at certain mines, anl the heavy shrinkage in transit of coal mined from wet veins, the railroads have in many cases been compelled to abandon this practice, and with but few exceptions soft coal shipments are weighed on railroad scales at the mines or at the point en route from the mines where scales happen to be located. » Provision is made in the railroads' tariffs for the reweighing of if desired by the consignee. The rules now obtaining on the ington in the matter of weighing and billing of coal are as fallow* B. ft Q. G. F. O. 2049-A, X. R. C.Xo. G-6): I "Rule No. 1. Coal loaded on C. B. ft Q.

When there are track scales at point of orisin, "actual tare weights" shall be used. I "When requested by the shipper, a bill of lading shall be issued cars of coal loaded on these companies' lines.

If not r&gt; equipped, shall weighed at first practical point en route where track scales an* rided.

The weights so rtained (subject to authorized minima) will be accepted as final, correction o» way-bill for charges from billing point will be made. "A charge of $1.00 per car shall be assessed for reweighing, provided such service is performed by these companies. If request by consignee for reweighing is made after cars have been placed for unloading, necessitating extra switching movement, the charge shall be the regular switching charge plus the |1.00 weighing charge, pro - vided cars have not been delivered to other lines for switching move - ment; in the latter event an additional charge shall be assessed as mar be determined upon by such switching road. ECars when weighed on track scales at destination shall be pled, clear and unhampered at both ends, shall be carefully ed by competent weighmen, and certificates in the following form upon request of consignees. FORM OF CERTIFICATE "Car number Weighed at Initials Date ti Marked ', Actual "I hereby affirm that the above car was carefully and accurately weighed by me the day and place specified, and that the car, when weighed, was uncoupled, clear and unhampered at both ends. Weighman." Similar rules obtain en the North-Western line. With but one •exception, the witnesses complaining of shortages in destination weights, admitted that they were not advised of the existence of sail rules, and were ignorant of the fact that upon request any carload shipment of coal might be weighed en route at the nearest divisioi station where scales are- located at an expense of one dollar ($1.00) if the company was so instructed, prior to the departure of such car from such station. The one witness, Mr. Carpenter, who was advised of such a rule, had only exercised his rights to have such cars weighed two weeks prior to the hearing, and while he testified that such service was not satis - factory, he did not furnibh any concrete instance of where any weights furnished under a reweighing order were incorrect. Taking this into consideration, together with the further fact that without exception all the witnesses Agreed that there was no complaint regarding weights of hard coal shipments, would indicate that there -was some cause for discrepancies in billed weights and destination weights on soft coal, other than the faulty weighing by the railroads, and that a careful shipper could amply protect himself by resorting t r&gt; t h c rptt'pj &amp;\\ i n e t*u 1 ps sibovf* set forth </seg>
            <seg id="p121">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 121 It is true, as urged by complainant, that they would occasionally incur additional and perhaps unnecessary expense in that, sight unseen, they would order cars reweighed in transit that might not disclose a shortage, and which consignee would not have ordered reweighed if he had first had an opportunity to inspect. I At the same time, the railroads plead that the initial expense of in - ation of a suitable track scales would amount to from twenty-three ired dollars ($2,300) to twenty-five hundred dollars ($2,500), the further fact that the cost and delay in stopping a local train eigh a car (as will necessarily be the case at York, there not being :ient business to justify the maintenance of a regular switching ' at that point) would be greater than the cost and delay involved erformed by a regular switching crew at a division point. As een the two pleas, the Commission is of .the opinion that if au &gt;st and reasonable application of the reweighing rules will do ce to the shipper, that the equities in this regard are with the Ddants. tThe Commission, however, is not convinced that an honest and onable application of the reweighing rules will prove fair an.l ifactory to the shippers, but it is satisfied that the railroads should be required to incur the added expense of installation, maintenance, and the coBt of reweighing by local train crews at York, until the s in question are given a fair and reasonable trial. If after such a trial, they should prove unsatisfactory and unfair to the shippers of York, the volume and character of the business done there and in the surrounding country would certainly justify tha Commission in compelling the railroads to provide and maintain a track scales at that place.

The Chicago &amp; North-Weetern Railway Company and the Chicago, Burlington ft Quincy Railroad Com - pany, Defendants. W. W. Wyckoff and S. H. Sedgwick for Complainant. Carl C. Wright for C. &amp; N. W. Ry. Co. W. A. Dilworth for C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co. REPORT OF THE COMMISSION J. A. WILLIAMS, Commissioner: tThe complaint in the above entitled cause was filed in this office Lhe 26th day of December, 1907. Separate answers were filed by defendant carriers. Testimony was taken by the Commission, nembers being present, at York on January 30, 1908, and at Lincoln February 5, 1908. Subsequently the parties to the controversy . briefs and reply briefs and the matter was submitted to the imission. I York is a city of more than 5,000 inhabitants, located a fertile agricultural region, 117 miles from Lincoln via the C. If. W. Ry. and 115 miles from Omaha by the same road, and it is miles from Lincoln via the C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. and 107 miles from aha by the same road. The Burlington extends east and west through the town and north and south and terminates on the north at Stromsburg, 17.3 miles distant, where it meets the Union Pacific Railway. The C. ft N. W. road extends in a northeasterly and southwesterly direction, terminat - ing at Hastings, 45 miles distant, and extending to Fremont and Omaha on the east. The complainant asks that the defendants be required to jointly build and maintain a transfer switch from the line of one of the •aid defendants to the line of the other and to receive and delive - upon said transfer switch such freight in carload lots as it may be necessary or desirable to transfer from one line of railroad to the other. The defendants, answering, denied that such a transfer switch is necessary and denied the power of the Commission to order such switch to be constructed and operated. It appears from the evidence that one business concern located near the C. ft N. W. road in said city transfers to and from the Burlington road as many as 100 carloads of flour and coal a year. It further appears that in some seasons it becomes necessary to get wheat from the Burlington and Union Pacific lines, and all this. </seg>
            <seg id="p123">123 Eher with the coal and flour, must be transferred in wagons at it of from $5.00 to $10.00 per car. The testimony shows that i business was cut out because there was no transfer switch at point. The Colorado and Wyoming coal comes in over the Burlington and it is claimed by complaiuant's witnesses that several towns east and west of York on the North-Western could be served with coal at lower rates than they are now obliged to pay if there were a transfer switch from one line to the other. The price of coal to York over the Burlington is $3.75, while at points on the Xorth-Westera. near York the price laid down is $4.80. The evidence disclosed, further, that near the line of the Bur - lington road there is a brick yard, the output of which is from 6,000,000 to 7,000,000 per year, and these constitute about 700 car- Witness Smith testified that he desires to ship out brick over the North-Western and that now, in order to do so, hu must haul his products in wagons about a milt*. He has no switch now to his yard from the Burlington, but such has been promised him by the representa - tives of that road. tThe evidence shows that this brick yard could serve considerable ticnal territory if there were better shipping facilities to reach North-Western line. It also appears that between the two lines be C. B. &amp; Q. railroad at York there is a connecting switch. Xo mony or reasons have been presented to show any essential ■MM between benefits and advantages that might be secured l a transfer switch between intersecting lines of the same pany and those from a transfer switch between lines of different panies. It is admitted in the argument of the answering defendant, the C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co., that the transfer switch asked for would be beneficial not only to York but to other towns on both lines of roa 1, and on other roads, and there is nothing in the testimony to show that any injury would be done to either road concerned. Considering the commercial importance of the city of York and the situation of the railroads there and the location of th" industries that require and' are entitled to reach as extended territory as possible for the advantage of both producer and consumer, and considering the benefits to the public generally from increased facilities for transportation, as appears from the evidence, the Commission is of the opinion that a transfer switch connecting the lines of the C. k N. W. Railway with the C. B. &amp; Q. Railroad in said city is a commercial necessity; that it would be beneficial to producers and consumers, and would be likely to increase rather than diminish the business of the respective railroads. The Commission is of the opinion, also, that on the right-of-way at and near the place of crossing of the tracks of the said companies. </seg>
            <seg id="p124">FIRST ANNUAL REPORT 124 there Is sufficient unoccupied land on which to construct a transfer .switch. The Commission is of the opinion, further, that, having deter - mined the reasonableness and necessity of such additional facility for transportation, it is within the lawful powers of the Commission to direct the common carriers concerned to jointly construct and operate .such transfer switch between their respective lines at this point. KThe Supreme Court of the United States decided in Jacobson Wisconsin, Minnesota &amp; Pacific Railroad, 179 U. S. 287, that act of a state legislature compelling common carriers to construct isfer switches at points where they are practicable and necessary for interests of traffic is valid and enforceable. In this state the constitutional amendment creating the Com - mission provides: k"The powers and duties of such Commission shall include the reg - ion of rates, service and general control of common carriers as legislature may provide by law. But in the absence of specific leg - ion, the Commission shall exercise the powers and perform the es enumerated in this provision." Subdivision 2, Sec. 2, Chapter 90 of the laws cf 1907, provides that: "Said Commission shall have the power to regulate the rates and ■services of and to exercise a general control over all railroads." It is further specifically provided that the Commission shall have power to establish joint rates over the railroads in the state. It must Inevitably follow that with power to make joint rates and with power to "regulate the service," the Commission has full pswer to order such facilities as might be required to put into effect any joint service or Joint rates which it might establish.. The construction of a transfer switch is most certainly one of the essential facilities in securing J-oint railroad service and would be absolutely necessary in securing compliance with an order to put in joint rates. The only limitation upon the promulgation of an order for a transfer switch is that it shall be reasonable under all the facts and circumstances. In the Min - nesota caEe, herein referred to, the United States Supreme Court said: "Taking the facts which we have already enumerated into con - sideration, we think there is no justification furnished for the argument that the judgment, if enforced, would violate any of the constitutional rights 'Of the plaintiff in error. In so deciding we do not at all mean to hold that under no circumstances could a judgment enforcing track connections between two railroad corporations be a violation of the constitutional rights of one or the 'ether, or possibly of both such corporations. I "It would depend upon the facts surrounding the cases in regard which the judgment was given. The reasonableness of the judg - nt with reference to the facts concerning each cas? must be a terial, if not the controlling factor upon the question of its validity.** "We think this case is a reasonable exercise of the power of reg - ulation in favor of the interests and for the accommodation of the pub - lic and that it does not, regard being had to the facts, unduly, unfairly or improperly affect th6 pecunlarv rights or interests cf the plaintiff in </seg>

            <seg id="p126">126 REPORT AND ORDER. HENRY T. CLARKE, JR., Commissioner: I On January 29, 1908, the City of Lincoln by its attorney filed in office of this Commission its complaint, alleging that the Oitizens set Railway, meaning the Citizens Railway Company, had voted and i about to issue a stock bonus to its stockholders equal in amount twenty-five (25) per cent, of its capital stock; that it was proposed iistribute said bonus to its stockholders pro rata, without receiving return in consideration therefor mcney or property of value, or er consideration; that such proposed issue of- stock was what is imonly know as "watered" stock. t Complainant further alleged that the Lincoln Traction Company its stockholders had under consideration, and proposed to issue a stockholders five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) of stock for ch the company was to receive in return neither money, property other consideration of value, and that said proposed issue was t is commonly termed "watered" stock. An investigation was demanded and an order prayed for, pro - hibiting the issue by respondents of any stock except for money, property or other consideration of equal amount and value actually received therefor. The Lincoln Traction Company filed its answer specifically de - nying the allegations of ocinplaint. The Citizens Railway Company filed its answer, objecting to the jurisdiction of the Commission to hear and determine the subject matter, and alleging in substance the following: That it was organ - ised in January, 1905; that its stockholders, exceeding eighty (80) in uumher, most of whom are residents of Lincoln, did, prior to Decem - ber 31, 1907, subscribe and pay for at par two hundred nineteen thousand, four hundred ten dollars ($219,410) of stock; that the com - pany had constructed and equipped twelve (12) miles of street railway In the city of Lincoln and had, prior to December 31, 1907, expended for construction and equipment a sum exceeding two hundred sixty - seven thousand dollars ($267,000); that none of the officers or stock - holders of the company had ever received any compensation or salary directly or indirectly, for the labor or service expended in organization, promotion and construction of said railway; that on January 11, 1908, the board of directors of said company, believing it was but fair and just that the amount saved to said corporation by its officers and -stockholders by not voting salaries, selling stock at a discount with ■which to raise money, or incurring sundry other expenses usual ■and customary in organizing and bringing into existence a large cor - poration such as the Citizens Railway Company, should inure to the benefit of the stockholders who had subscribed for the stock and taken the hazard of organizing and building this road, made the orders and declared the dividends hereinafter stated. That in the judgment of </seg>
            <seg id="p127">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 127 said board, a reasonable and fair amount t* oover the various items herein referred to was forty-five thousand dollars ($45,000). That, acting upon that judgment, the board of directors of said Citizens Railway Company, did, on said January 11, 1908, when duly convened as a board, pass resolutions reciting that, whereas, on September 28, 1907, the Nebraska State Railway Commission, on Formal Complaint No. 3, City of Lincoln vs. Lincolr Traction Company. Citizens Railway Company et al, made an order permitting thirty thousand dollars to be added to the amount of capital stock in consid - eration of the services rendered by the stockholders and officers in promoting the company up to that date; and whereas, since said date and until December 31, 1907, said stockholders and officers bad rendered further services in promoting said company in an additional amount of the reasonable value of fifteen thousand dollars, it is resolved that the bookkeeper of said company be, and he thereby was directed to make an entry in the books of said company charging construction account with said sum, to-wit, forty-five thousand dollars (145,000) and to pass the amount thereof to the credit of surplus ac - count out of which a stock dividend might be declared to the owners and holders of the stock theretofore issued, end being in consideration of raid services up to said December 31, 1907. That at said meeting of said board it was further determined that an examination be had of the condition and financial resources of the company; that after the entries directed to be made had been placed on the books there would then be in the surplus account the sum of fifty-seven thousand six hundred eighty dollars and two cents ($57,680.02), which amount ■warn and is available for the purpose of paying a dividend upon th« stock theretofore issued and subscribed for; and it was further re - solved by said board that a stock dividend of twenty-five p?r cent, be and it thereby was duly declared to be paid to the present owners and holders of said stock, and the amount thereof to be charged by th? bookkeeper against said surplus account. I On the 25th day of February, 1908, a hearing was held at :h all parties were represented by their officers and attorneys. At hearing one of the directors of the Lincoln Traction Compan/ fled that the capital stock of the company was limited to an i of one million, sixty-five thousand dollars ($1,065,000); that the e was all issued and that any further issue would require an ndment to the articles of incorporation; that neither the stock - ers nor the officers of the company contemplated any increase ae capitalization or the further Issuance of stock at this time. No ence having been offered to the contrary, the Commission find? the complaint so far as it relates to the Lincoln Traction Company ild be dismissed. The Citizens Railway Company, both in its answer and on the Introduction of evidence, objected to the jurisdiction of the Commission. </seg>
            <seg id="p128">128 FIRST ANNUAL, REPORT The question of whether the Commission has jurisdiction to hear and determine the extent and for what purpose stock or bonds may be issued by a railroad corporation, is presented squarely for the first time. An examination of the constitution and of the statutes fails to - disclose any specific grant of Jurisdiction in cases similar to the one here submitted. It becomes therefore necessary to determine whether the power to exercise jurisdiction in the premises can and should be reasonably deduced from the laws defining the powers of the O:m - ■tatoa. The constitutional amendment creating the Commission provides inter alia: t"The powers and duties of such Commission shall include the - lation of rates, services and general control of common carriers a* legislature may provide by law. But in the absence of specific lation the Commission shall exercise the powers and perform the •s enumerated in this provision." tThe legislature of the state has supplemented the above provision e constitutional amendment in subdivisions b and c of section '£ e Railway Commission Act, which provides: "(b) Said Commission shall have the power to regulate rates and services of, and to exercise a general control over all railroads * and all other common carriers engaged in the transportation of freight or passengers within the state. t"(c) Said Commission shall investigate any and all cases of alleged &lt;?t or violations of the laws of the state by any railway co'mpany immon carrier subject to the provisions hereof doing business in statt, or by the officers, agents, or employees thereof, and take - action with reference thereto as may be provided herein, or under iws of this state providing for the regulation of railway companies mmon carriers. " The legislature has, in section 4 of said act, expressly declared a street railway company to be a common carrier. The Commission does not desire to arrogate unto Itself or ti&gt; •wnme any authority which it does not possess under the constitutional amendment, or the statutes. The extent of its powers under said amendment can only be finally determined by an interpretation and construction thereof, as laid down by the Supreme Court of the state. And until such time a* the Supreme Court of the state shall, by their judgments and decrees, define its powers and duties, the Commission has, for reasons which it deems good and sufficient and most likely to promote th? public welfare, decided that the said amendment vests directly in It the power to regulate the rates and. services of, and to exercise a general control over all common carriers engaged in the transportation of freight or passengers within the state. (J. A. Pyle et al v. C. R. I. ft P. Ry. </seg>
            <seg id="p129">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 129 Does a reasonable interpretation or construction of that part of the amendment granting the Commission power to exercise a general control over common carriers, include the power to regulate and limit the issuance of stocks and bonds of a common carrier? We do not hesitate to say that it is net a strained construction or unwarrantable inter - pretation to say that it does. That it !s a matter requiring control is beyond question. Many states by statute have made and provided in specific terms the con - ditions and limitations under and within which corporations may issue stocks and bonds. Ee necessity of such legislation regulating in this regard corpora - coming under federal control is receiving the thoughtful aid ive consideration of the President and congress of the United Indeed the founders of our own state government early recognized the possibility of evils that might arise from the unlimited and unre - stricted issuance of stocks and bonds by railroad corporations, and endeavored to prevent such practice by incorporating in the consti - tution of 1875 the following provision: I "(Sec. a — Art. 11.) Xo railroad corporation shall issue any stock bonds, except for money, labor or property actually received and lied to the purposes for which such corporation was created; and all ■k dividends and other fictitious incr.ase of the capital stock or in - ted ness of any such corporation shall be void. The capital stock railroad corporations shall not be increased for any pur]&gt;ose except &gt;r public notice for sixty days, in such manner as may b provided law." I Our Supreme Court, commenting on this provision of the con - tion, in their decision in the case of the City of Lincoln vs. Street way Company, 93 N. W. 766, say: "This provision is an important one. It was intense! to prevent overcapitalization of railroads, and prohibit the issu ; of v. hat is com - monly known as watered stock, upon which exorbitant charges for trans - portation of passengers and commodities might be basei: thus creating an apparent necessity for such charges, in order to earn and pay divi- dends thereon. It is a wise and beneficent measure ar ' we should tnlorce it strictly whenever occasion requires cr opportun: y permits U3 to do so." While the court In this caee raised the qustion as to whether that provision in the constitution (Sec. 5, Art. 11) applied to ■ railways, for the reason that it refers to the term "railroads," and at the time of the adoption of the constitution there were nn i railways in existence in the state; yet it might be claimed that the authors of the constitution, aware of conditions then obtaining in more populous states, and foreseeing the future developments in this state, provided accordingly and intended that the said pro\ should so apply. tThe fact that the state legislature s. constitutional conventions and ts have thus spoken in no uncertain terms, should foreclose toe saity of stating in an academic way the reasons and argument fying and requiring such regulation and control. </seg>
            <seg id="p130">130 However, counsel for the Citizens Railway Company argued that Inasmuch as the Commission had power to investigate the value of the property, the amount invested, etc., and that so far as arriving at a decision as to what would be fair and compensatory rates and charges, the amount of bonds and stock issued would have but little weight, if not be entirely immaterial. I The amount and market value of stocks and bonds issued by a ier are not immaterial nor always to be disregarded by the mission In arriving, first at a valuation of a given property, and •after determining and fixing rates. They can in no case be a con - ing factor, but they are and must be, to a greater or less extent, rding to the circumstances of each case, given their proper weight. yth vs. Ames, 169 U. S. 466.) As stated by the Court in San Diego 1 &amp; Town Co. vs. National City, 14 Fed. 83, affirmed 174 U. S. 767: I "The buyer of such bonds, like the loaner of money on a mort - s, knows that the conditions may be such as to increase the value his security, or may be such as to decrease its value. He &gt;s the chances that everybody takes who engages in business isactiona. The buyer of bonds issued by a water company such he complainant has the like knowledge and the further knowledge ; the law which everyone is presumed to know, prescribes that the s to be charged for the water furnished by the company shall be blished and fixed by special tribunal." I The above rule applies alike to purchases of the stock and bonds ommon carriers. That it is a wise rule, no student of the evolution our government can question. That occasionally its application ks a hardship on the small investor who has in good faith and bout full knowledge of the facts, jeopardized the savings of a llfe - e, is only too well known. I The frequent and unrestricted issuance of watered stock ultl - i\y affects and injures the public at large. Large 'enterprises, i as railroads, street railroads, «'tc, require a large amount of tal. With but few exceptions, no one man nor set of men can ect and carry out any large undertaking with their own private ns. It becomes necessary to interest the numerous small investors to induce them to exchange their savings for the securities of the iThe demand c.f the people is insistent and imperative that the &gt;s and charges of common carriers shall be commensurate only h a fair and reasonable return in the way of dividends and interest the actual value of the property. And in the fixing and establishing such rates, the fact that the watered stock, etc., has been issued l sold at its face value to unfortunate and misguided purchasers s not justify a legislature or a commission In burdening posterity h exhorbitant or excessive rates in order to maintain the values. tThe natural result of such conditions is a decrease In the value he securities so watered. The public is unable to discriminate fully between watered stocks and bonds and the securities of panies which have been honestly conducted, both in capitalization </seg>
            <seg id="p131">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 131 and management. The decline in value of a watered stock reflects on the value of all securities and thereby tends to the already growing lack of confidence of the public in the possibilities of such securities as a safe investment. And unkee care is taken to regulate and restrict the issuance thereof, and the public advised so far as it may be, by * properly constituted and disinterested authority that such securities are issued oDly for a full and valuable consideration, and represent an actual, and as far as possible, a permanent value, the public will shy at such securities. kin this event, many meritorious and much needed public service prises will fail in their completion, or perchance may never be rtaken, unless government ownership should supply the need. The Commission therefore feels that it is not doing violence to the constitution in assuming jurisdiction herein, but that, on the contrary, by so doing it can, in a measure, protect the Investor from loss and ultimately, if successful in its purpose, by creating and in - creasing the confidence of the people in the stability and value of the securities of honestly conducted and well managed corporations, make it easier to finance and build needed improvements or additions in the way of public service enterprises. The offlosrs of the Citizens Railway Company at the hearing pre - sented the following statement as proper items of capitalization and In justification of the issuance of the three hundred thirty-six thousand, seven hundred sixty-two dollars and fifty cents (1336,762.50) in controversy: December 31, 1907.

The fact that the Commission is called on to 'tion the issuance of stock in consideration of promotion services, ch includes the financing and organizing of the company, and construction of its plant during the same period, gives added force he reasons why such a rule should be followed. In other words, as applied to this case, the holders of the original issue of two hundred nineteen thousand four hundred ten dollars ($219,410) stock should not receive interest on their subscriptions from date of payment to December 31, 1907, and at the same time receive dividends from the seventeen thousand nine hundred ninety-four dollars and eixty-eight cents ($17,994.68) net earnings •earned from operation during the same period. tThe Commission is of the opinion, and so finds, that the company Id be permitted to charge itself and credit its stockholders with sum of forty-five thousand dollars ($45,000) for promotion ser - i. Considering the fact that the company received par for its stock. </seg>
            <seg id="p134">134 that it Incurred no expense dn Belling the same, that it paid no profits to a construction company, that its officers have given their services at a nominal salary, if not, in fact, without charge, and considering further the condition under which the company was organized, and the further fact that in the figures heretofore given no allowance is made for any value that may attach to the company's franchise, the Commission finds that the above allowance is reasonable and just. tNow that the company is a going concern, the Commission is of the [on that no further allowance of this kind should be made for pro - ng or financing extensions, etc., that may be hereafter made, but the company should be permitted in such case to increase its cap - stock or bond issue only to the extent of the actual outlay it may e by reason thereof. Adding this forty-five thousand dollars ($45,000) to the two hundred seventy-six thousand, one hundred forty-seven dollars and nineteen cents ($276,147.19) received from stock subscriptions, net earnings devoted to construction and paving donations, we have what, in the opinion of the Commission, is the fair and reasonable value of the company's property, towit: the sum of three hundred twenty - one thousand, one hundred forty-seven dollars and nineteen cents ($321,147.19), or fifteen thousand, six hundred fifteen dollars and thirty-one cents ($15,615.31) less than the amount of stock proposed to be issued, if not already issued. tin other words, assuming that all the debts of the company will be I from the sale of the fifty thousand dollar issue of stock, It is of opinion that the company is overcapitalized to the amount of fifteen isand, six hundred fifteen dollars and thirty-one cents ($15,615.31). I If this excess valuation were fraudulent and corrupt, the Commis - would not hesitate to order its cancellation and enforce its order in courts. But the Commission is ct the opinion that the officers of th? pany acted In good faith and that the overvaluation of the property he officers of the company is not so extensive as to justify thds Com - slon or a court in adopting such a course. (Gilkie ft A. Co. vs. rson T. ft G. Co., 46 Neb. 333; Kelley vs. Fourth of July Mining Co., L. R. A. 621.) In the latter casa the rule announced was: I "Good faith in the valuation put upon property for which stock corporation is issued, is demanded and all that is demanded by the which provides that stock may be issued for property to the unt of the value thereof." The Commission is of the opinion, however, that the defendant company should not be permitted to proceed on the basis of its property being actually worth the full amount for which it is now capitalized, i. e., three hundred thirty-six thousand, seven hundred sixty-two dollars and fifty cents ($336,762.50). Under some jurisdictions, railroad commissions have specific authority, upon finding that capital has been impaired, at the same time It approves the issue of new stock, to require the company to make good out of its income through the diminution of dividend, or otherwise, such impairment. </seg>
            <seg id="p135">135 Such a practice appeals to the Commission as wise and judicious, and while no specific authority in such cases is given the Commission by statute, yet if the Commission's interpretation of the constitutional amendment creating it is correct, then it is proper, and in fact its duty, to take such action in the premises as it deems just and reasonable. The issuance by the company of an excess of stock of fifteen thousand, six hundred fifteen dollars and thirty-one cents ($15,615.31) above the valuation of its property may be and should be treated as an Impairment of its capital to that extent.

WINNETT, Chairman: In this complaint the City of Havelock complains that It is being discriminated against by the Lincoln Traction Company in faror of </seg>
            <seg id="p136">136 I village of College View. The present rate to Havelock from Lincoln »own to be five cents (5c) to University Place and an additional flve - : fare from University Place to Havelock, making a ten-cent (10c) from Lincoln to Havelock; or when tickets are u&amp;ed, eight and -thirds cents (8 2-3c) while from Lincoln to College View the rate ne-half this amount. The distance between Lincoln and University Place is 4.77 miles, and from University Placs to Havelock 2.27 miles, making the distance between Lincoln and Havelock 7.04 miles. The distance between Lin - coln and College View by the Traction Company line is 6.16 miles and by the Citizens line B.05 miles. The present rate of five cents between Lincoln and College View was fixed by the Traction Company volun - tarily before the Citizens Railway Company with its shorter line had entered tbe Held as a competitor, and this fact must be taken into con - sideration in determining the reasonableness of the ten-cent rate be - tween Lincoln and Havelock. I The rate to Bethany over the Omaha, Lincoln &amp; Beatrice Interurban , 5.82 miles, is ten cents, fifteen cents for the round trip, or eight eU for fifty cents. The rates fixed by the Commission for the City ..incoln (Formal Complaint No. 3) are five cents cash fare or six ets for twenty-five cents, but the rates to the various points outside City of Lincoln are voluntarily made by the various companies. I It seems necessary to permit common carriers having the shortest to fix the rate, or if fixed by the Commission, to fix it on the short basis, permitting the longer line to meet the rate if to its interest &gt; so. The practice of street railway companies in fixing certain rates upon a cone basis, as is done in the case under consideration, is discussed by the New York Public Service Commission (Second District) in the matter of the complaint of Citizens Committee of Watervliet against United Traction Company in the following language: I "It is the general practice of street railway companies to fix their s of fare on a zone basis instead of a mileage basis. These zones larze or small, as local conditions may determine. Density of popu - in. difficulty of operation, the presence within the zone of localities uently visited, such as amusement parks, etc., are large governing ors. Outside of limitations laid down in particular statutes or fran - ?s. it may be said that the law has set no limit on these fares, fur - tban to Inhibit generally a charge greater than five cents for one inuous ride within the boundaries of any incorporated city or village to say that such charges must be just and reasonable. • • * t"H remains, therefore, to be decided whether the fare complained Is 'unjust and unreasonable.' It is not to be disputed that the &gt;ondent has the right and Is within the ordinary practice of street way companies in fixing its fares according to the zone system. ! question simply is: Is it just and reasonable that the boundary of e No. 1 should stop at Schuyler's bridge, or should It be extended :hfr northward to take in any part of the city of Watervliet? k'^n determining the answer, distance between points is but a r, merely, and is by no means controlling. In a territory In h communities are as closely related as are those of Albany, Troy. </seg>
            <seg id="p137">137 Krvliet, Waterford and Cohoes, the arrangement of the entire m is to be taken into the account so far as it concerns the con - nee and economy of all the patrons carried." I The contention of the Traction Company is that the line between ersity Place and Havelock is a separate organization, operating ir a separate charter, an! is entitled to earn sufficient revenue to operating expenses and reasonable dividends on that line. The ence shows that a separate account has been kept of the earnings his line, but no separate account of the expenses. There had no effort made to separate either the earnings or the expenses le College View line from those of the Lincoln system. tThe evidence shows the earnings of the College View line (includ - that portion which properly belongs to the Lincoln system) for six months January to June inclusive, 1908, were $15,558. The •ersity Place line during the same period earned $24,953, which ings include fares paid by Havelock passengers between Lincoln University Place. The earnings between University Place and Block for the same period were $5,578 as compared to $7,310' for same months of 1907, showing a loss of $1,732 for the first six ths of 1908 as compared with the first six months of 1907. From a careful consideration of all the evidence submitted in. this case it seems clear that complainant is entitled to some relief, but it is by no means certain that such a radical reduction as is asked for in the petition would enable the defendant company to pay operating expenses, fixed charges and a reasonable return upon capital invested. All orders of this Commission are subject to review by the courts, and it is not within its power to put in and maintain a rate that is not compensatory, although the company may be voluntarily giving a rate to a place similarly situated that in itself is not compen - satory. As an example, the Commission could not order the same rate from Lincoln to Bethany as that given by another company from Lincoln to College View unless upon investigation the College View rate was found to be compensatory. It seems, wise, therefore, that caution should be exercised to the end that the benefits of any reduction ordered may be enjoyed by the people who patronize this line, which would not be the case should the revenue be reduced to a non-compensatory point, enabling the defendant company to go into court and set aside the action of the Commission. A cash fare of seven cents, or four tickets for twenty-five cents, between Lincoln and Havelock would reduce the earnings on the present volume of business between Havelock and University Place about $6,000, which would undoubtedly be com - pensated for to some extent by increased traffic. ORDER. IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Lincoln Traction Company be, and the same is hereby directed, on and after December 1, 1908, to establish a cash fare of seven (7) cents, or four tickets for twenty-five (25) cents </seg>

            <seg id="p139">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 139 The defendant company is a railway corporation owning and op - erating a line of railway between stations in Nebraska, and passes through the corporate limits of the village of Hallam, the plaintiff herein. From the evidence it appears that the townsite of Hallam was platted and the village government organized subsequent to the con - struction of defendant's read. The town as platted covers an area of about eighty (80) acres, being about forty (40) rods wide and eighty (80) rods long. The railroad enters the village from the south and, passing through in a northeasterly direction, divides the town into two almost equal parts. I The central and main street of the village is called Main street, and i east and west en the section line, crossing the railroad tracks a few north of the depot; The defendant company maintains crossings 4aln street and on Peach street, the first street south of Main street, parallel thereto, but has not provided a crossing on Walnut street, first street north of Main street and parallel thereto. tit further appears from the evidence that the village school house icated on Main street on the east side of the railroad track; that village doctor resides on Walnut street east of the track; that tho ness portion of the village is located on Main street west of the track, the most thickly settled portion of the community and the village •ch are on Walnut street west of the track. It further appears from the evidence that it was a frequent occur - rence for the trains of the defendant company from the south to block Main street and Peach street, and that if a suitable crossing was provided at Walnut street the public might cross there without delay. It further appears from the evidence that the chairman and board of trustees of the plaintiff village on the 1st of April, 1907, passed an ordinance opening Walnut street across the right-of-way and roadbed and track of the defendant company; that said ordinance specifically declared the necessity for the opening of such street, provided for the condemnation of such portions of defendant's property as was neces - sary for the opening of such street, provided for the election of five disinterested householders to assess the damages sustained by the defendant company, provided for the compensation to the appraisers in said condemnation proceedings, and provided for the service of notices and the method of procedure. It further appears from the evidence that on April 2, 1907, the village clerk posted up certified copies of said ordinance In three of th3 most public places in said village; that the five householders elected to assess the damages severally subscribed to the oath that they would faithfully and impartially assess such damages as might be sustained by the defendant company by reason of the condemnation proceedings, and the time and place when and where said appraisers would meet and •■MSB the damages was duly served on the defendant company; that said appraisers, pursuant to said notice, met at the time and place stated </seg>
            <seg id="p140">140 FIRST ANNUAL REPORT in said notice and assessed the damages sustained by the defendant company; that thereafter, to-wit: on the 10th day of April, 1907, the ▼illage treasurer tendered in money to the defendant's agent the amount of damages found by said appraisers to have been sustained by the defendant company; that said tender was refused and that the money la now held in the said village treasury subject to the order of the defendant; that no appeal has been taken from such condemnation proceedings. tit further appears that prior to filing its petition before this Com - on, the plaintiff herein filed a petition in the district court of Lan - r county, asking that a mandamus issue from that court against the idant company requiring it, as is herein prayed for, to open said c street and place a suitable crossing across its said line of railway said street. Said cause is still pending and undisposed of. tit appeared from statement of counsel that the contention made le defendant company before said court was that this Commission original jurisdiction in such cases and that the cause must first esented to it for its findings and order. It does not appear that the s raised in the district court involved the formalities and steps i by the village authorities in opening said street. Were the ity of these proceedings attacked in the case pending in the district ;, the Commission would not feel that it could properly act in this until that question was decided by the court. tThe Commission here expressly disclaims any authority or power ten streets or highways, and could proceed to a hearing in this only upon proof that a highway had been legally opened and sected the railroad at the place where the crossing is desired. KThe proof in this case was clear and convincing that said street highway known as Walnut street in Hallam had been properly ned; that all legal formalities have been complied with, and that no eal has been taken therefrom. Such being the case, three questions presented to the Commission by the pleadings filed herein: 1st. Has the Commission jurisdiction over railroad crossings on public highways? 2nd. Having such jurisdiction, should the Commission exercise It during the pendency of the present action in the district court? 3rd. Are the plaintiffs entitled to relief as prayed for? The constitutional amendment creating this Commission provides inter nlia: ' l"he powers and duties cf such commission shall include the regulation of rates, service and general control of common carriers as the legislature may provide by law. But in the absence of specific leg - islation, the Commission shall exercise the powers and perform the duties enumerated in this provision." Kursuant to this amendment, In 1907 the legislature of the state ed an act known as the Railway Commission Act, which among •r things provides: </seg>
            <seg id="p141">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 141 E "Section 2 (b). Said Railway Commission shall have the power gulate the rates and services of, and to exercise a general control 1 railroads • • • • engaged in the transportation of pas - ■rs within the state. "(c). Said Commission shall investigate any and all cases of alleged neglect or violations of the laws of the state by any railway company * * * subject to the provisions hereof doing business in this - state, or by the officers, agents or employees thereof, and take such ac - tion with reference thereto as may be provided herein, or under the laws of this state providing for the regulation of railway companies. "(i). The said Commission shall have the power to examine int&gt; and inspect from time to time the condition of each railway or common carrier, its equipment and the manner of its conduct and management with regard to the public safety and convenience in this state. Section 110, chapter 78, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1903, provides: "Any railroad corpcration, canal company, mill owner, or other person or other persons, who now own or may hereafter own or operate any railroad or canal or ditch that crosses any public or private read shall inak and keep in good repair good and sufficient crossings on all such roads, including all the grading, bridges, ditches and culverts that may be necessary within their right-of-way." The Supreme Court of Nebraska in the case of State ex rel Lan - caster county vs. C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co., 29 Neb. 412, has sustained this provision of the statute, and held that it is the duty of the railroad company to make and keep in repair suitable crossings with approaches, notwithstanding th; highway was laid out after the railroad was built. (Followed and approved, Mo. Pac. Ry. Co. v. Cass Co., 107 N .W. 773.) In the course of its opinion in this case (29 Neb. 412) the Court "It is of vital importance to those traveling by rail or upon a public road that the crossings should be properly constructed and kept In good order. These crossings require attention, the same as other portions of the track, and are liable to constantly get out of repair. The section men in the employ of the railroad are daily passing over the track and would soon discover a defect in the crossing and remedy it. Not so with the road supervisor; he seldom sees the cross- Ing. Th? company by laying its ties and rails and making its grade, renders a crossing necessary, and it is not unreasonable to place the burden on the one making it necessary. The interest of the public, as well as that of the railroad company, require that the latter should have exclusive control of the crossings. If inexperienced road super - visors were renuired to construct and keep in repair these crossings, great loss of life and property would likely result from the negligent construction or failure to keep in good order the crossings. The pur - pose of the legislature in placing this burden upon the railroad corpora - tion was to secure the safety of the public travel and transportation." While the terms of the constitutional amendment and the provi - sions of the Commission Act do not specifically and in express terms confer the power to exercise jurisdiction in such cases, yet the power to "exercise a general control" specifically expressed in both the con- </seg>
            <seg id="p142">FIRST ANNUAL REPORT 142 stltutional amendment and the Commission Act would, in the ab&amp;ence of any other provisions, in the opinion of the Commission, vest it with the power to act. It is not necessary, however, to resort to these general grants of powers. Section 110 of chapter 76, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1903, heretofore quoted, makes it the duty of the railroad corporations in this state to construct and maintain suitable crossings over public high - ways. Paragraph b of section 2 of the Commission Act, heretofore quoted, imposes the duty upon the Commission of investigating any and all cases of alleged neglect or violation of the laws of the state by any railroad company. From the evidence adduced herein It la apparent to the Commission that in law a public highway kn:&lt;wn as Walnut street crosses defendant's right-of-way, roadbed and tracks In the village of Hallam, and defendant has refused and neglected to construct and maintain a suitable crossing as provided by law. Nor is this all. Paragraph i of section 2 of the Commission Act, heretofore quoted, makes it the duty of the Commission to examine Into the condition of each railway, etc., with regard to the public safety and convenience, and confers certain powers !n the premises. It is the opinion of the Commission that under the terms of this sec - tion, and pursuant to the opinion of the Supreme Court in the case of State vs. C. B. tt Q. R. R. Co., 29 Neb. 412, herein cited and quoted, It cannot avoid acting in this cause for lack of jurisdiction. (Answering the question as to whether the Commission should exer - its powers during the pendency of the action in the district court, the opinion of the Commission that inasmuch as that action was not I until after the Commission was created, that action was prema - ;ly brought, and that original jurisdiction rests with the Commission, action must first be obtained before the court can take cognizance he case. t While there have been no decisions rendered by our Supreme Court e the creation of this Commission on its having exclusive jurisdiction iich cases, there are two decisions rendered during the existence of old Board of Transportation which would appear conclusive as sus- Ing the position of the state. (State vs. C, St. P., M. &amp; O. Ry. Co., «eb. 476; State vs. C, B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co., 29 Neb. 419.) In the latter case the Court said: "The Board of Transportation has jurisdiction to hear complaints and make orders in regard to the construction and repair of crossings where railroads intersect public highways. The authority is clearly conferred by section 2 of the act creating that Board. The action of that tribunal must be obtained in order that this Court may take cog - nizance of the case." From the evidence it appears, and the Osmmlsslon so finds, that Eblic highway known as Walnut street in the village of Hallam es the defendant's right-of-way and track; that the maintenance suitable crossing at this intersection would not subject the public ling by rail or by road to any unnecessary danger, and that such </seg>

"Union Pacific R. R. I On October 23, 1907, a month's notice having been given by letter by publication to all who might be interested, a hearing was had evidence taken. KThe sole purpose of the proposed schedule and rules was, as enced by the testimony of the railroad representatives, to obtain early delivery of shipments and release of cars containing ship - its so made, and a consequent increase in their available equipment tFrom the evidence it appeared that the practice of making shlp - ts subject to the reconsigning privilege has been growing from ' to year, that particularly on coal shipments from all points and the shipments of lumber from the northwest, where the time iumed in transit varies from two weeks to three and four ths, such practice is a great accommodation and under present lltions absolutely necessary to the end that the public needs may in a measure at least, promptly met. So far as it appeared from the evidence, but tew instances had occurred where this privilege had been abused. tOn the contrary, the evidence showed that diverting orders on a b percentage of the shipments so made were prior to or within ity-four hours after arrival of shipment at original destination, that the delay in releasing equipment was not due to the shipper, rather to the railroad company by reason of its failure to promptly ard or switch cars so engaged. It further appeared that the establishment of the proposed schedule would not only inconvenience the public, but would sub - ject the consumer to an increased burden in the payment of charges without affording any relief to the railroads commensurate with the inconvenience and burden so placed on the public.

            <seg id="p150">150 FIRST ANNUAL REPORT Warren Pratt for Kearney Telephone Company. Frank E. Beeman for remonstrators. J. A. WILLIAMS, Commissioner: KA petition in the foregoing entitled cause was filed by the ney Telephone Company with the Nebraska State Railway nission on the 9th day of January, 1908. Subsequently thereto a protest was filed by one Frank R. Beeman and others. The petitioner asked that it be given permission to establish and promulgate in the city of Kearney, Nebraska, and Ticinity, a schedule of rentals and charges for telephone service per month, as follows, to-wit: For business telephones — unlimited service $3.00 For residence telephones — unlimited — beyond one and one-half miles towards city limits from central office 2.00 For residence — unlimited — within one and one-half miles toward city limits from central office 1.50 For residence — two party line — beyond one and one-half miles from central office towards city limits 1.50 For residence — two party line — within one and one-half miles from central office towards city limits 1.25 For residence — four party line — beyond one and one-half miles from central office to- wards city limits 1.25 For residence — four party line — within one and one-half miles from central office towards city limits 1.00 A hearing was held at Kearney, Nebraska, on the foregoing application by Commissioner J. A. Williams on the 27 th day of January, 1908, and further evidence was taken by the full Com - mission at Lincoln, Nebraska, on the 26th day of February, 1908. The cause was argued by counsel on both sides to the controversy and the matter was submitted to the Commission. It apears from the testimony that the Kearney Telephone Company was organized in February, 1905, with authorized cap - ital stock to the amount of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000). At about the time of its organization, this company purchased from Warren Pratt and others, the plant of the Home Telephone Com - pany, the plant of the Kearney and North-Western Telephone Com - pany, and the plant owned by one Mamie Updike at Overton, Nebraska. It appears further that an issue of bonds to the amount of forty thousand dollars ($40,000) was made and these bonds, together with sixty thousand dollars ($60,000) in stock were given as the consideration for the plants herein named. These bonds bear interest at the rate of six (6) per cent. The remainder of the stock, to the </seg>
            <seg id="p151">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 151 amount of forty thousand dollars ($40,000) was placed in the treas - ury to be sold. Sixteen thousand, two hundred twenty-five dollars ($16,225) have been received on sales of stock, and of this five (5) shares only, at twenty-five dollars ($25) each, were paid up at the time the company began business. In addition to the sixteen thousand, two hundred twenty-five dollars ($16,225) received on stock sales, the amount of receipts for the three years ending Decem - ber 31, 1907, was fifty thousand, one hundred thirty dollars and ninety-four cents ($50,130.94) making the total receipts sixty-six thousand, one hundred ninety-one dollars and eighty-two cents ($66,191.82). During the same period, according to Mr. Whit - more's testimony, thirty-five thousand, seven hundred forty-six dollars and thirty-one cents ($35,746.31) was expended on the plant. The evidence produced, however, does not make it clear to the Commis - sion as to how much has been actually invested in the plant now in the control of the applicant, and there is not satisfactory evidence aa to what the present value of the said property is. The whole matter is somewhat uncertain and obscure. It is clear, as suggested, that the applicant capitalized its plant at one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) and has incurred a debt of forty thous - and dollars ($40,000) by way of bonds, and that it presumably paid for its plant this amount and stock to the amount of sixty thous - and dollars ($60,000). The testimony is that the bonds to the amount of forty thousand dollars ($40,000) were sold for cash at par and that no part of the proceeds went into the plant secured by the applicant. The forty thousand dollars ($40,000) thus stand - ing against the plant, together with the amount put into the plant since the purchase by the applicant, viz: thirty-five thousand, seven hundred forty-six dollars and thirty-one cents ($35,746.31), is prac - tically the amount that may be said to be invested, or against which it could, in any sense, be claimed that the plant should produce earnings. It is apparent that the plant should not be expected -o earn a reasonable income on one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) and pay interest besides on forty thousand dollars ($40,000) in As before stated, it is quite impossible for the Commission to determine from the evidence what the plant is worth now or what it will be worth when the contemplated improvements on which the application for advanced rates is predicated shall have been com - pleted, and the Commission can only determine what seems to be reasonable rentals for such service as is contemplated from the im - proved plant as indicated by applicant, and it seems, under all the circumstances, that it would be reasonable to allow in an exchange the size of that of the applicant, a rate of $2.50 per month for unlim - ited business service, $1.50 for unlimited residence service, $1.25 for two-party line service, $1.00 for four-party line service.

E. Smith for applicant. Oscar Anderson for renionstrators. REPORT OF THE COMMISSION J. A. WILLIAMS, Commissioner: I The application herein was filed March 12, 1908, and on March 1908, a protest was filed by O. J. Hall, A. H. Fellers and other jns of Humboldt, Nebr., and a formal answer was subsequently by the same parties. kA hearing was held at Humboldt In the town hall by Commis - ir J. A. Williams on April 9, 1908, when the testimony of ry witnesses was taken and subsequently the record was laid ■e the Commission at their offices in Lincoln. The applicant asks to be allowed to charge a monthly rental of $1.25 for telephones installed in residences, private barns and feed barns and on rural lines owned by others and built up to the corporate limits of Humboldt. It is worthy of note that a general misunderstanding in the community was cleared up by the evidence. The applicant is the successor of the Humboldt Telephone Company, the purchase having been made in 1904. The remonstrants declared in their answer that the writings that passed at the time of the sale contained an agreement by applicant that the rate for residence telephones should not exceed 75 cents per month. The old company was charging $2.00 for business 'phones and $1.00 for residence 'phones. tThe new company, the applicant herein, made the business rate 0 and the residence rate 75 cents, and maintained these rates I January 1, 1906, when the business rate was made $2.00 again, documentary evidence does not show any agreement by the appli - to maintain a 75-cent rate for residence 'phones. At the time of the purchase by applicant there were about 150 city telephones and a few 'phones on lines owned by others and built up to the city limits. The applicant made extensive improvements and the total number of telephones operated has been Increased to about S46, and of these 69 are on the rural line. There Is an investment of $21,482.00. This was made from earnings, the proceeds of the sale of stock for the sum of $14,000 and $6,500 borrowed money. Up to January 1, 1908, $982.70 was taken from the earn - ings and applied on the construction account. Balance of earnings warn applied to payment of running expenses and dividends in the sum of $1,546.50. It seems to be generally understood that the cost of operating per 'phone increased slightly with increase of number of 'phones. </seg>
            <seg id="p155">155 I There was no evidence of mismanagement or misappropriation unds, and it appears that during the entire period of applicant's :ence, about three and one-half years, regular meetings of the store have been held and the board is made up of business men he city. The cost of material was admittedly higher during the three years, and the new company continued to furnish free lection with the Speiser Mutual Telephone Company to secure a (fit to Humboldt, and which free service was about to be cut by the old company at the time of sale. ORDER. Considering the amount invested, the small amount of dividends paid, the lack of evidence of mismanagement or misappropriation, and the kind of service that is being rendered, it seems to the Com - mission that it would not be unreasonable to permit the applicant 10 again make a charge of $1.00 per month for the classes of 'phones for which it now charges 75 cents. It is therefore ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that from and after July 1, 1908, the applicant, the City Mutual Tele - phone Company of Humboldt, Nebraska, may restore the former charge and collect from its patrons the sum of $1.00 per month for telephones in residences, private barns, feed barns and on lines owned by others and built up to the corporate limits of Humboldt. ■ Made and entered at Lincoln, Nebraska, this 29th day of June, D. 1908.

This matter arises under an informal complaint (No. 153) filed by Peter Youngers, H. W. Marshall and W. A. Harrison, a committee representing the nurserymen of the state of Nebraska, complaining of the release valuation clause on nursery stock, as set forth in item 65, page 95 of Western Classification No. 43. iThe matter having been taken up In person or by correspondence the following railroads, to-wit: Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy road Company, Union Pacific Railroad Company, St. Joseph ft id Island Railway Company, Chicago &amp; North-Western Railway pany, Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha Railway Company, ouri Pacific Railway Company, Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific way Company, and all of said railway companies having, through r proper representatives, either in person or by letter, waived her notice and hearing, and consented thereto; IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that item No. 55, page 95, of Western Classification No. 43, so far as it applies to shipments between stations in Nebraska, be amended so as to read: "Nursery Stock: P.

            <seg id="p163">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 163 General Order No. In the Matter of Facilities Afforded Shippers of Grain Complaints having been made that certain of the railroads doing business between stations in the state of Nebraska have failed to furnish box cars properly equipped with inside doors for the shipment of grain, the Commission upon investigation finds that It has been the universal and long continued practice of the carriers doing business lu this state, to furnish with box cars ordered for grain shipments Inside doors known as grain doors; that such Inside or grain doors are necessary for the prevention of loss of grain by leakage in the course of transportation and are a facility which may reasonably be required of all carriers engaged in the transportation of grain between stations in this state. In the opinion of the Commission the above findings are indisputable and a formal hearing unnecessary. The failure of the carriers to furnish such grain doors to each shipper places an undue burden upon and unjustly discriminates against the grain shipper not furnished with cars so equipped. Without action by this Commission the only recourse left the shipper is to furnish the said doors at his own expense and await the pleasure of the carriers in adjusting his claim and reimbursing him therefor. By reason of the foregoing, the Commission deems that an emer - gency exists. tIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the common carriers engaged he transportation of grain between stations in Nebraska be and same are hereby notified and directed in filling orders for cars for n shipments within Nebraska to furnish box cars properly equipped inside or grain doors.

This matter coming on to be heard under an order issued by this Commission, and all the carriers doing business in this state and parties interested having been duly notified, and evidence and argument having been heard, the Commission finds that where a shipper demands the same, carriers should be required to give a receipt or bill of lading tor all property offered and accepted by them for transportation; that the evidence offered by the carriers to sustain the fixing of any charge or rate for the return of "empties" is insufficient and too indefinite to Justify the Commission in providing for added compensation, where *uch receipts or bills of lading are required or demanded. </seg>

(SEAL) General Order No. 11. In the Matter of Local Train Service. Many complaints having been made in regard to the changing: of time schedules and the discontinuance of local freight and passenger trains between stations in Nebraska, the Commission upon investigation and due consideration finds that where a carrier has been operating and furnishing a given train service to a community, the discontin - uance of any such service without any substitute being made therefor, results in great inconvenience, and not infrequently in great loss to the' shipping and traveling public. In such cases the inconvenience and loss thus occasioned may be - far out of proportion to any saving that may accrue to the carrier. It is the opinion of the Commission, therefore, that the carriers operating local freight and passenger trains between stations in the state of Nebraska should not be permitted to discontinue any such service except upon good cause shown. tin the case of changes in the time schedules of any such trains. Commission, without waiving any rights or releasing the carriers l any penalties which they may incur by reason of any violation of provisions of sub-bection c of section 15 of House Roll No. 305, ap - ed March 27, 1907, recommends that the carriers refrain from ing any changes in this regard except upon careful consideration with due regard to the needs and convenience of the public. IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway- Commission that no carrier operating local freight or passenger trains between stations in Nebraska shall discontinue any such train service until application has been made to this Commission and its permission bad for that purpose.

I Gentlemen: We received a day or two ago a copy of House Roll 305, creating and defining the duties of your honorable Commission, outlining the duties of the various companies relative to filing dules of rate and charges therewith. It is the desire of this company to comply in every particular with the laws of the various states, and with the laws of Nebraska, but we beg to submit that we have very carefully considered the provisions of this Act and given them the broadest interpretation we are able. We believe that their purpose and effect as indicated by the various regulat - ing provisions of the Act suggests posting these schedules in the various stations and depots, and stating therein places to which property and passengers will be carried, classifications. Etc., are intended and do embrace only such companies who offer themselves to the public gen - erally as carriers of freight or passengers for hire, and to perform or furnish such necessary facilities in connection therewith as may be re - quired by the nature of the transportation, and that the whole design of the Act is to regulate the relations between such companies and the pub - lic with respect to such transportation. Each provision of the bill which relates to the duties to be performed by the carrier deals with the relations between the public and the common carrier and the subject - matter of the transportation. We most respectfully suggest that a company of the nature ot this company is not within the purview or the spirit of that Act. The Armour Car Lines does not within the state of Nebraska or elsewhere hold itself out to the public as a carrier of freight or engaged in the business of transportation. The objects of the company are con - fined solely to the owning of refrigerator, ventilator and other specially constructed cars, the renting or leasing of said cars to various rail - roads within the state of Nebraska and elsewhere, and furnishing to said railroads under contract or agreement with said railroads refrig - eration for the various cars so leased or rented. The company is paid by the railroads for the rent of said cars either on a mileage basis or a per diem basis, and for such refrigeration certain agreed prices or rates, determined by the places along the line of said road, or beyond, over and to which such refrigerated product is shipped. The company's relations, therefore, to the subject matter of the Act extends no further than the rental by it of its cars and furnishing by R of refrigeration therefor to tbe various railroads under agreement with respect to the compensation to be paid said company for the rental of said cars and for so furnishing said refrigeration by said railroads. It. therefore, has no relations or dealings with the public with respect either to the transportation or refrigeration of products shipped in its cars, that being handled entirely by the railroad com- </seg>

The charges paid for these ities are matters purely between the railroad company for furnishing i and the shipper, over which the Armour Car Lines has and exercises lfluence whatever. As the Armour Car Lines have no relations with E&gt;ers, they have nothing which they could file which would comply the provisions of this Act requiring rates and schedules. §We most respectfully urge, therefore, that this company is not iD the purview or the intent of said Act, and respectfully request your Commission so hold.

We believe that a charge of $1.00 per car is usually assessed if weighed at destination point, when the car has already been weighed at point of origin. Destination weights, under such circumstances, are accepted by all railroads operating in Nebraska as the correct weights upon which charges are figured. Very truly yours, CLARK PERKINS, Secretary.

You will not that the Attorney General holds that in his opinion * reduced rate cannot depend upon the quantity of service contracted to be furnished, as in this case, without violation of section 14 of the Railway Commission Law, and that the practice named should be discontinued.

The only exceptions to this provision are found in subdivision g of the same section, which is as follows: 1 "Nothing in this act shall prevent the carriage, storage, or lling of freight free of charge or at reduced rates for the state, ot any city, county or town government, or for charitable purposes, 3 and from fairs and expositions for exhibition thereat." It seems plain that while the general provisions of this law apply to telephone companies which are included under the term, "common carriers," the exception referred to applies only to th« handling of freight, and does not refer to telephone service. KThe Commission, therefore, construes the law to mean that no •ial rate, rebate, drawback or charge of any kind other than the liar schedule on file in the office of the Railway Commission shall collected or received from any person, firm or corporation for phone service, and that free service is not permissible in any case.

Under the published tariffs of the express companies their state - ment to you of the situation is correct. On page 8 of their Classifica - tion and Table of Graduated Charges, quoting from the Pacific Express Company's Classification, under the head of "Empties, Owners' Risk," It provides: t"The nominal rates given below, are made for the return of empty cages which were shipped when full, by express — the fact that the shipment has been paid for at full rates justifying a reduced rate the empty package the return of which is necessary for the trans - ation of future shipments. "Therefore, empty packages which were not shipped by express, when full, must be charged for at merchandise rate. "The outward charge paid on certain shipments will entitle the empty packages to be returned without additional charge, such empties being marked thus +. "Unless otherwise provided, they must be called for and delivered by owners, and charges must be PREPAID." I The only other provision in the tariff is that ice cream empties page 9 of the tariff) may be returned with charges to collect, by ;ment with owners, at 15 cents each. § Therefore, until some further change is made in the tariff and ished, to avoid discrimination, it is necessary for owners to deliver call for ice cream empties.

K. &amp; T., submitted by the Missouri Pacific Railway, we have to say that the facts as nitted in the letter to Mr. Loftus, which you enclose in your letter, v a different condition than the facts upon which we based our ious opinion. In the first place, the Commission, on its former ruling, inferred that the railroad company was remiss in failing to set the car on Neat's switch, and that it was consigned to Mr. Carrigan, and that it was part of the contract that he should deliver the coal to you. Under the facts as stated in Mr. Loftus' letter, when the car was reconsigned to you at Neat's switch and same was set there, it constituted a delivery to you and you would be responsible for demurrage charges. t While it does not so state in this letter, we have learned that the ch into Neat's coal yards was filled with cars at the time the cars in stion were set, and the railroads fulfilled their whole duty in setting cars upon a track as near as possible to the track in question. Un - these circumstances, the Commission will have to rule that the •oad company is right in its contention, and that your institution, g the consignee, the railroads having attempted to set the cars in proper place and being unable to do so, had to set them to the ,-st point to that track, you will be responsible for demurrage or car ice' charges. If the Commission is wrong in its understanding of the facts upon which it bases this ruling, kindly advise us. Yours very truly. H. T. CLARKE, JR., Commissioner Omaha, April 23, 1908. Nebraska State Railway Commission, Lincoln, Neb Gentlemen: Referring to yours of the 11th inst. in regard to car service charges again, I will state the facts as I understand them and If, upon looking them over, you are of the opinion that it would not establish a wrong precedent by so doing, I will send in the $9.00 and close the controversy.

As you will note from section 1 of rule 6, the delivery of a car consigned to or ordered to a private track, will be considered to have been effected, either when such cars have been placed on the track designated, or if such track be full, when the road offering such cars would have made delivery had such track permitted. From our understanding of the case, the Missouri Pacific endeav - ored to Ht the cars in question on the private tracks to Neal's Coal Yards; that these tracks were filled at that time and accordingly cars were set as near as possible to the track in question.

If Carrigan company failed to notify you or your agent, Neal, or cause the railroad company to do bo, they should pay the charges.

It Is a question of policy as to whether you should pay freight based on the originating weights and then make application through the Interstate Commerce Commission for a refund, stating the circumstances, or whether you should pursue your present plan of refusing to accept the car. There is no question in the mind of the writer but that you are entitled to the car upon payment of freight based on actual weights. Commissioner Prouty of the Interstate Com - merce Commission, in the case of J. H. Leonard vs. M. K. &amp; T. Ry Co. et al., No. 1079 (12 I. C. C.

We think that the track weights of the idant should determine the actual weight of these shipments and complainant is entitled to a refund upon that basis.

II presume that you are aware of the fact that only recently the rstate Commerce Commission have made two rulings which appear e in direct conflict; one being that a railroad company in accepting ?ht must protect the consignee or consignor by routing that shipment line giving protection on the lowest basis of rates and another ruling rerning a case here in Iowa where they hold that a consignor cab - route freight to a point in this state and reconsign on the Iowa ance tariff rate in order to secure the lowest through rate, for the on that it is the consignor's intention at the time of shipment to msign the freight beyond first destination to secure the lowest rate, the honorable gentlemen at Washington say this is not permissible. tYou can see from the two propositions given above, that while Interstate Commerce Commission hold that the railroad com - es must protect the public by giving shippers and consignees intage of shortest practicable route and necessarily lowest freight 3, yet they say that if consignor undertakes to do this himself they not allow him to do so. tlf the position taken by the Interstate Commerce Commission r the ruling of this last case is to establish a precedent, it tically eliminates for all time to come railroad competition In this try.

            <seg id="p218">FIRST ANNUAL REPORT 218 Lincoln, Feb. 11, 1908. Mr. H. L. Laird, Secretary, Marshalltown, Iowa. Dear Sir: Replying to your favor of the 4th inst., I have to say - that it is the purpose of this Commission to exercise its full powers in protecting the shippers and citizens of this state. As you know, the scope of our powers and jurisdiction is not definitely defined. In nutters which directly tend to regulate interstate commerce we have absolutely no jurisdiction. We can appear and plead before the Inter - state Commerce Commission in behalf of the citizens and communities of this state. The Beatrice case involved the question as to freight due on an interstate shipment of a car of coal, on which the destination wtights proved less than mine weights. It is the opinion of the Attorney General and the Commission that in such cases the state commissions are without authority to issue any orders. tDr. H. J. Winnett, our chairman, was present at the National Con - ion of State Railway Commissioners at Washington last fall and no recollection of any resolution being passed unanimously by the ention to the effect that the state commissions should exercise diction over any controversies arising upon interstate shipments nating or destinating in their respective states. What you have in mind is, doubtless, the report of the committee od demurrage and reciprocal demurrage, and relates more particularly to regulation concerning the place, manner and time of delivery of merchandise moving in the channels of state and interstate commerce, and the time of loading and unloading freight by shippers and consignees. I The report of the committee recognized the wide divergence of ion as to whether state commissions could make regulations regard - demurrage and reciprocal demurrage on interstate shipments, and further fact that the courts must ultimately determine whether they and if so to what extent. The legislatures or commissions in some bs have attempted to do this, particularly Texas, which imposed on carriers a penalty of $25.00 a day for failure to promptly receive, rard or deliver cars according to rule. The Supreme Court of the :ed States in the case of Houston &amp; Texas Central- Railroad vs. Mayes 1 N. S. 329) decided this statute unconstitutional. In its opinion 1 "Although it may be admitted that the statute is not far from line of proper police regulation, we think that sufllcient allowance &gt;t made for the practical difficulties in the administration of the law, that, as applied to interstate commerce, it transcends the legitimate ers of the legislature." tThe Georgia Commission has passed rules affecting both state and ■state shipments which, in its opinion, appeared to be reasonable just and in which the difficulties presented by the Texas case seemed &gt; entirely absent. It was their opinion that their rules were "an aid not a burden to commerce," and that until congress takes juris - on in such matters and passes a demurrage law that the states Id be free to do so. </seg>
            <seg id="p219">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 219 I This opinion, I am informed, met with the approval of the con - tion. The Georgia rules, however, are held in abeyance by injunc - i pending a decision of the federal courts. I Answering your other propositions regarding the two rulings of ! Interstate Commerce Commission referred to in your letter, I have say that they are not in conflict nor inconsistent. In the one case, ere a shipper delivers a shipment to the originating carrier consigned a given point, and there are several routes, it is made obligatory the originating carrier to ship via the route having the lowest rate. In th 1 . above case, and I assume that you had in mind the Hennepin Paper Company of Minnesota against the Northern Pacific et al. there w?re three different routes by which the shipment could be routed. The Iowa case referred to by you I do not recall, but to sustain the opinion of the Commission, and I am familiar with this ruling it must be that the shipper at the point of origin billed the shipment to the first Iowa point and showed on his billing that it was his intention that the shipment should be transported to the second or final point of desti - nation. It is the law and has been so held by the Supreme Court (see .204 N. S. 403 and cases cited) that on an interstate shipment, if there is a through rate published, the through rate is the only lawful rate, and that neither the railroad company nor the shipper can be a party to avoiding the rate by billing it on a basis of the sum of the two locals. In the Minnesota case, there were three routes, and in your Iowa case I assume that there was but one route. If the through rate is greater than the sum of the two locals, on complaint, the Interstate Commerce Commission will assume that the through rate is prtwm fnrie unreasonable and places the burden upon the carriers to show that it is not. In such cases, the carriers are permitted to file an amended through tariff rate, equal to the sum of the two locals, to take effect within three days of mailing or filing, while in the ordinary cases tariffs must be on file thirty days before becoming effective. If your association has made a study of the various car service t demurrage rules in effect in led views as to which are ifactory, I would be pleased the various jurisdictions and has any the most reasonable, practical, and to hear from you in detail regarding Yours truly. T. CLARKE, JR., Commissioner H. March 3, 1908. Hon. Henry T. Clarke, Jr., Nebraska State Railway Commission. Lincoln, Neb. KDear Sir: Again referring to your esteemed favor to this Nation under date of February 11th, covering the matter of oollec - of freight on coal shipments, on basis of destination weights Into aska. </seg>
            <seg id="p220">220 FIRST ANNUAL REPORT We wish to call your attention to how this matter is now working out. The 111. Cent. R. R. have recently issued amendment to their coal tariffs, which in addition to the $1.00 charge for weighing coal at : nation, provide an extra charge for switching the car, making the rewelghing charge in all $3.00. This, of course, is against the weight laws of both Iowa and Nebraska, and our state commissioners have taken the same position as this Association, in standing upon the ground that this extra charge of $2.00 is a local item, and that the Iowa law provides for only a charge of $1.00 for reweighing coal shipments, that Inasmuch as delivery is practically made on shipment at time of re - weighing, the 111. Cent, people have no right to assess this extra expense against the consignee. I We note that in the first paragraph of your letter to us referred above, you say that on ttoe&gt; Beatrice case the question involved cerned the freight due on an interstate shipment of coal, on which destination weights proved less than mine weights, and it is the ]ion of your honorable body and the Attorney General that in such ;s the state commissioners are without authority to issue any orders. BWe would like to inquire as to whether or not you believe that ansignee can enforce his rights to settlements on destination weights shipments of this character, under the Nebraska destination weight , or if not, what recourse must he pursue to secure redress? I In support of the 111. Cent.'s position, they state that this extra ching charge is made to cover "the additional service made neces - in telegraphing, clerical hire, switching the car in and out of train be scales, and for replacing in the train." Now, the stand taken by 111. Cent, might be right from their point of view if they had track €s at every point of any importance along their line, but it Is true at points where there are track scales, they are division points, and trains are broken up at these places and there is really no expense ex - involved in the service performed, and if there were, it is not reason- I to assume that in making up coal tariffs in the past the 111. Cent, pie, or any other line for that matter, 'have been content to move the Re on freight rates which incurred a loss, but it is natural to ime that the business has been profitable to them and that such con - :encies as the items mentioned above have been taken into account i part of their operating expense in moving the business at a profit. This is pointed out to you for the reason that while as yet the 111. Cent, are the only line who Have so far taken this action, it is presumed that other companies will soon follow suit, and upon the case which we took up with the Iowa board, the reweighing charge and the recon - aigning charge collected by the 111. Cent, company raised the rate on the shipment 14.4 cents per ton. 1 Trusting you will be kind enough to favor us with prompt reply to questions Involved, we remain, Yours truly, COAL DEALER'S ASS'N OF IOWA AND NEBRASKA. </seg>

Dear Sir: Will you kindly refer to our letter to you under date of March 3rd, 1908, covering the question of compliance with the Ne - braska destination weight law on carload shipments on the part of transportation companies, and advise if the Nebraska Board of Railroad Commissioner* and your Attorney General still adhere to the position that you are powerless to act in cases where the shipments are inter - state business? IFor your information we hand you herewith opinion of the Attorney ?ral of this state to the effect that the Iowa board under the Iowa have the right to say what charge shall be made for reweighing, and railroad companies in this state are making settelments on destina - weights and allowing consignees to deduct the freight charges to r such shortages as there may be on coal shipments. It occurs to us e ought to be uniformity in these matters, and especially so as the i and Nebraska laws are practically the same with the exception that - state law is broader and covers all carload shipments, while the i law covers only coal shipments. Trusting that you will let us hear from you at an early date covering this whole proposition, we beg to remain. Yours very truly. COAL DEALER'S ASS'N OP IOWA AND NEBRASKA H. L. LAIRD, Secy.

Gentlemen: I am returning you the papers in the Edmunds- Freeman Company vs. Illinois Central Railroad Company, covering the question of the railroad company's right to charge for reweighing coal in this state an amount in excess of that fixed by chapter 113 of the laws of the thirty-second general assembly. tit is my opinion that that chapter limits the amount that may b? ged by railroad companies operating within this state for weighing; ; that this limitation applies to both interstate and intrastate ship - ts, as indicated by your chairman in his letter to the traffic manager tie Illinois Central Railroad Company of February 18th. Respectfully, H. W. BYERS, Attorney General for Iow«. July 29, 1908 To the Honorable Board of Railroad Commissioners, Capitol Lincoln, August 24, 1908. Mr. H. L. Laird, Secy. Marshalltown, Iowa.

            <seg id="p222">222 r I Kb 1 ANNUAJj Knr OKI In the event of any carriers refusing categorically to obey the mandate of said law and the order of the Commission in this regard, the Commission will advise consignees in such cases, prior to delivery at their sidetracks, to tender to the carriers the full amount of freight demanded by the railroad company and thereupon to order carrier to weigh said coal prior to delivery at their yards. The suggestion is made on the theory that after said coal is on the storage or transfer tracks of the railroad company and the consignee accepts same and pays the freight, that the interstate character of the shipment would cease at that point and that it then becomes a state shipment subject to the state law and the orders of the Commission. tAt the same time, wi? believe it desirable, if possible, to compel carriers to publish in their tariffs a rule or regulation providing for reweighing of coal at destination or as near destination as sible, subject to a reasonable charge, and if it is necessary to resort he Interstate Commerce Commission to compel the carrier to put into ct such rule or regulation, it is the purpose of the Commission to so. I would be pleased to have you make any suggestions in this regard that you deem proper.

Crete, Neb., Feb. 13, 1908. Nebraska State Railway Commission, Lincoln, Neb .Gentlemen: We desire to know whether or not the railroads of Nebraska have a right to assess a weighing charge for reweighing coal ir transit on order of consignee, as provided by law. I think the law makes no mention of any charge for reweighing, and as reweighing at destination or in transit at a point near to destination seems to be about the only satisfactory method of determining whether or not the railroad Is delivering to consignee all the coal for which it receipted to consignor and on which it is assessing freight charges (being simply in effect "checking out" at destination). KI think it has been assumed by the coal trade that in the absence of specific provision in the statute for a reweighing charge, that it was intent of the legislature that transportation charges should cover reweighing. I am of the opinion that that was the construction originally pat upon the statute by the railroads themselves. At least their earlier practice, so far as my experience goes, has been in harmony with that construction. Recently they have assessed a charge of $1.00 for re - weighing in transit. If this matter has been brought before the Commission, will you kindly advise me of their ruling upon it? Yours very truly, GEORGE W. BALDWIN. Lincoln. Neb., Feb. 14, 1908. Mr. George W. Baldwin, Crete, Neb tDear Sir: Replying to your favor of the 13th inst., we have to that where coal has once been weighed at point of origin or in transit the consignee orders it reweighed, it is lawful for the railroads to ;e an additional charge for reweighing any such car. If the car was !d out from the mines, without being weighed there or In transit, a lignee can insist on the car being weighed without extra charge. The demand for destination weights should be made before the car is delivered, otherwise in case of reweighing not only the reweighing charge, but regular switching charge can be assessed. The rules applying in such cases are prfhted in C. B. &amp; Q. G. F. O. No. 2801-A. These rules, so far as the Commission is advised, have been regarded </seg>
            <seg id="p225">225 and held reasonable by the Interstate Commerce Commission, and until they are amended or cancelled and the tariffs amended accordingly, it would be unlawful for the carriers not to assess a reweighing charge for such service.

I presume, on account of this being interstate business, it would not come under your jurisdiction. But we would like to know the Nebraska ruling on this point; and, if you know, also the Interstate Commerce ruling on the same point. There was a ruling that they could not charge more for a short haul than they did for a long one, where a pMnt was directly intermediate.

Subdivision c, section 10662, chapter 47, Cobbey's Annotated Statutes of 1907, provides: "If any railway company or common carrier subject to the pro - visions of this act. through or by its officers, agents or employees. shall charge or receive any greater compensation in the aggregate for the transportation of like kind of property or passengers for a shorter than for a longer distance over the same line, the same shall constitute an unjust tiiHTiroination, which is hereby prohibited; provided, that upon application to the Commission any railroad may In special cases, to prevent manifest injury, be authorized by the Commission to charge less for longer than for shorter distances for transporting persons and property, and the Commission shall from time to time prescribe the extent to which such designated railway company or common carrier may be relieved from the operation of this provision; provided that no manl - djustice shall be imposed upon any citizen at intermediate points; provided that nothing herein shall be construed so as to prevent the Commission from making what are known as 'group rates' and 'emer - gency rates,' as herein provided, on any line or lines of railway in this state." The haul from Pawnee City, Neb., to St. Francis, Kan., is, as you suggest, interstate, and therefore the above law has no bearing upon this particular complaint. The Interstate Commerce Commission has held that the published rate is the only rate that can legally be applied upon an interstate shipment, regardless of whether it is higher than the rate for a longer haul on the same line. The only way by which such a rate can be corrected is upon complaint to the Interstate Commerce Commission and a showing that it is unreasonable, unjust, excessive or discriminatory.

As yet the matter has not been clearly presented to the Commission In a formal way. Pending a decision or determination on a formal complaint, the Commission has permitted telephone companies to place telephones in depots without charge to the railroad company. This has been done on the ground of public policy and on the theory that It is a service which your subscribers want and which your company desires to furnish to its subscribers, and in case the railroad company refuses to pay for same it is borne by all subscribers alike. It is simply a question as to whether or not, under present con - ditions and decisions the telephone companies can induce the railroad companies to pay.

I Dear Sir: Replying to your favor of the 25th inst. in regard to ced combination rate where same party uses business and residence hone: Upon the presumption that you have established an open rate of $3.00 per month for one business and one residence telephone where both are maintained by the same party, a firm composed of two or more members would be entitled to that rate upon one business 'phone and one residence 'phone, and if more than one residence 'phone is maintained by the parties comprising such firm they should pay the $1.25 rate each. If the firm maintains more than two business 'phones they would, of course, be entitled to the combination rate upon an equal number of residence 'phones. I In regard to the Atlas Elevator Company case to which you refer, see no reason why the combination rate should not apply to the me maintained in the agent's residence, inasmuch as both are paid according to your statement, by the elevator company. We know of no provision in the law which would sanction free ■ervice over your toll line to government employees from the Omaha agency to Walthill. In our opinion the same would constitute a dis - crimination and be in violation of section 14, chapter 90, Session Law* or -NeDrassa ior i»u/. </seg>

Very truly yours J. P. GIBBON. Lincoln, May 4, 1908. Mr. J. P. Gibbon, Kearney, Neb. Dear Sir: Your favor received in which you ask the following, to-wit: "If your body should make a per cent reduction on the present railroad distance tariff used in Nebraska, or if you should adopt an entirely new distance tariff, would either have the effect of cancelling the present Omaha terminal tariff now in effect on grain?" Answering will say: If a per cent reduction should be made on the present railroad distance tariff, it would not have the effect of cancelling the present Omaha terminal tariff in effect on grain unless it were made so that the rate made would be lower than the rates in such terminal tariff. t Again, if an entirely new distance tariff should be adopted it would affect the terminal tariffs unless, first, it should make the rates lower t the present terminal rates, or unless, second, it should be made as aximum and minimum distance tariff. In the latter case It would of ■s? put out all rates lower than such as it would make, and also all e higher than such as it would make. I Of course, you understand this answer is based theoretically on hypothetical questions which you proposed. I am glad you asked question and hope that this complicated matter may be adjusted as i ae possible in such a way as to promote just-ice to all and destroy rimination and unfairness to any persons or communities.

The Interstate Commerce Commission has made the following ruling thereon: "Section 1 of the act provides that free transportation may be be furnished 'to necessary caretakers of live stock, poultry and fruit.' This provision in the statute is construed to mean necessary caretakers of live stock, poultry or fruit that is loaded and ready for movement, or the movement of which is actually contracted for or that is actually in transit, and may include free or reduced fare transportation for the return of such necessary caretakers. This transportation may be in the form of free pass or reduced fare transportation, but in any event it must be the same for all under like circumstances and must be published in the tariff governing transportation of the commodity. Tariff may provide that caretaker sent out to return with shipment that is arranged for or that is in transit will be required to pay fare going and that such fare will be refunded if person so sent does return as actual caretaker of shipment for which he is sent. But a tariff rule which provides that if a person goes out over the line with the intention of purchasing live stock, and returns within a certain time with a certain number of cars of live stock, the carrier will refund to him the fare paid on outgoing trip, is improper and unlawful." kVou will notice that neither the law nor the rule of the Interstate merce Commission makes it obligator} 7 upon the railroad company irnish such 'transportation, but merely makes it possible to do so eired.

The system adopted by these concerns seems to be that they allow these rebates to their prospective customers or such men as they capture to go with them, paying the difference themselves. KIs such a rebate allowed under the law in force in our state and small concerns have to yield to the system in order to not be rded out of business?

It is possible, however, that the terms of the contract can be lawfully carried out upon the theory that such service is given in consideration of the rights and privileges conveyed by the franchise and is not, in any sense, free service. There is, of course, a possibility that such service would be technically a -violation of the anti-discrimination clause of the Railway Commission Act which provides that no "greater or less compensation for any service rendered or to be rendered by it" shall be charged by anr common carrier than it charges or receives from any other person, firm or corporation for doing a like and contemporaneous service. tin the absence of a complaint based upon this theory, the Corn - on will not deem the service given by your company to the city of noe in the fulfillment of its franchise contract, dated July 8, 1899, free" service, and will raise no objection thereto.

The Beatrice Creamery Company are very active petitors in the field north of Grand Island and Columbus, and I have rmed that company that we cannot give them any service on cream :h they accept from their patrons, after our train has left Grand id on Sunday morning, until Monday morning. tl have made it plain to the Beatrice Creamery Company that the fie Express Company have no train service from Grand Island to oln on Sunday, and that that company should not accept or should allow their agents to accept cream on Sunday afternoon after our i has gone, to be held at Grand Island until Monday morning. tThe answer of the Beatrice Creamery Company is that they dare refuse to accept the cream, because if they did so, the other merles would get it; therefore, you can see at a glance that the mery company is simply using the express company as a cat's paw old its business, and in order to make the hardship more binding Beatrice Creamery Company want to force the Pacific Express Com - r to haul this cream, which they do accept on Saturday or Sunday.. wing that we have no train service, all the way to Omaha which is rely out of route, transfer it to the Missouri Pacific and take it into •oln on a roundabout line, which should not be used for this purpose. I By bringing this cream into Omaha, it causes the Pacific Express ipany a vast amount of trouble, for the reason that Omaha Union ion is already In a congested condition. There are no facilities there handling the cream that belongs to Omaha proper, and we object to ging the Lincoln cream into Omaha and have to separate it from the iha cream, and then furnish more help to transfer It to the Missouri Iflc, to carry down the main line to Union and there delay the souri Pacific trains in another transfer before we can get this cream &gt; a train to carry it into Lincoln. Now, our contention is that if it Is an accommodation to the creamery company for the Pacific Express Company to do all this extra service and save that business for the creamery company which some other creamery would take away from them if they handled it properly, then we should have pay for it. tlf that business was turned over to any other express company or •oad company at Omaha, or any other point, tbe ruling of the arable Commission would be, that on account of this extra service other express company, or the other railroad company would receive pensation ; then why should the Pacific Express Company be discrlm - ed against and caused to do all of this extra work and not be </seg>

Circular No. i issued April 8, 1908, gave notice that unless good cause be shown the contrary, on the first day of May, 1908, at ten o'clock a. m., the ler complained of by you would be adopted. We heard nothing from l with reference to the matter and you were not present on the day = J for hearing. I An investigation instituted by the Commission upon numerous plaints that messenger fees were charged where no messenger ice was actually performed, developed the following facts: Certain line companies have made arrangements with local exchanges to He their messages under contracts for a proportion of the charges , commission on all outgoing business. Nothing was paid by such panies upon business received, the local company depending for its pensation upon charges for delivery over its switchboard. This lally amounted to a switching fee, which few, if any, companies &gt; filed in this office, in accordance with section 5 of the Railway [mission Act enclosed herewith, aDd such charge was therefore, n strict interpretation, unlawful. The investigation developed the further fact that certain other con - tracts provided for a proportion of the toll charges or commission to be paid the local company on both incoming and outgoing business, thus eliminating the necessity for messenger charges as a means of compen - sation for handling this class of business, and giving the customer what h; had every right to expect, viz: service between given points where full connection was made by wire, at the published and lawful rate. For the purpose of equalizing charges under substantially similar conditions and to remove the causes of many well-founded complaints. General Order No. 16 was issued. There is no desire on the part of the Commission to deprive any telephone company of a fair rate of compensation for legitimate services actually performed, but there is serious objection to tha practice of certain toll Hue companies charging a messenger fee over and above their regularly filed and published toll rates, where no messenger service is performed, delivery being made over ths wires of connecting companies. This is not only illegal where such delivery rates have not been filed with the Commission, but is unfair to the customer, who is entitled to the delivery of his message, where joint relations are sustained for such purpose, at a fixed and definite rate. It is furthermore, a discrimination, in that it makes the rate on incoming messages at Crab Orchard from a given point higher than the rate on outgoing messages from Crab Orchard to the same point. t Ample opportunity having been given all local companies to be 1 on this proposition before the order was issued, the Commission the opinion that no good purpose can be served by granting your </seg>
            <seg id="p244">244 request for a farther bearing. They believe that the matter now rests between the several local companies affected and their toll line connec - tions, and that if the toll line companies are unable to properly reim - burse the local exchanges, the proper solution of the problem will be through an application from the toll line companies for authority to increase their rates to a point which will enable them to do so. I In any event, the regularly published toll rates on file in this mast, after August 1, 1908, cover the entire service between givea s, except where messenger service is actually performed.

Gentlemen: In yours of August 5th you stated that you were sending blank form for the annual report of our company, and at the present writing we have not received it. The company began business May 19th, so we have not much of a report to make at this time. How - ever, if the law requires it, we will cheerfully give what report we have. tlf it is in order, I would like to ask the question for our mutual ■fit, whether a private individual, not incorporated, would exercise same authority along the right-of-way as a company that is incor - ,ted. Further, would he come under the laws to be governed and i the same protection as incorporated companies? This Is new I to me, and any information that you may be kind enough to glv*» lure you will be greatly appreciated. Yours truly. BOYD COUNTY MUTUAL TELEPHONE CO. FRANK TALICH, Secretary. Lincoln, August 22, 1908. Mr. Frank Talich, Secretary Boyd County Mutual Telephone Company Bristow, Neb. Dear Sir: Replying to your favor of the 14th inst.: I We are sending you under separate cover blank form for the annual rt of your company for the year ending June 30, 1908, to take tli« i of the one which you say you failed to receive. Replying to your Inquiry in regard to whether a private individual would exercise the same powers, be governed by the same laws and have* the same protection as an Incorporated company, will say that this would depend upon whether he was performing the functions of a common carrier or whether he maintained a telephone line purely for his own convenience and not ae a profit-making enterprise. Section 11963, chapter 55, Cobbey's Annotated Statutes for 1907, reads as follows: "That any telegraph or telephone company incorporated or doing: business in this state shall he and is hereby granted the right-of-way </seg>

You will note that this provision refers exclusively to Incorporated companies. It may have been the intent of the law, however, to make the same apply to any company or individual transacting a general public telephone business, and it is impossible to say until after the matter shall have been presented to a court of competent jurisdiction what the final determination thereon would be.

Yours very truly, THE PLATTE VALLEY TELEPHONE CO. P. ALEXANDER, Manager. Lincoln, August 22, 1908. Mr. P. Alexander, MgT. Flatte Valley Telephone Co., Scottsbluff, Neb. I Dear Sir: Replying to your favor of the 14th inst. in which you for a ruling in regard to the propriety of employees of a telephone pany using the lines of said company for their private business: tThis matter was brought to the attention of the Commission at a ing held on August 21, 1908, and the following informal ruling made: KThis matter arises on the Inquiry of certain telephone companies reference to permitting their employees the free use of their tive local and toll lines. While a strict construction of th» : discrimination clause of the Railway Commission Act might for - lch a practice, it is the opinion of the Commission that the yees occupy a different relation to the said companies than the il public and that public policy does not require that the yees of a telephone company shall be deemed to occupy a different </seg>
            <seg id="p246">246 position toward their respective companies and the public than the rail - road employees occupy toward their respective companies and the public. f"It is therefore the opinion of the Commission that until otherwise Ised. or until specific legislative enactments are passed with refer - i thereto, the employees of a telephone company who devote major portion of their time to the service of the company, should permitted to accept at the hands of their respective companies free use of their local and toll lines." ■ With reference to that part of your letter relating to free service for enterprises of a public nature, I would respectfully call your atten - tion to section 14 of House Roll No. 305, otherwise known as the Railway Commission Act. copy of which is enclosed herewith, which provides: t"If any railway company or common carrier subject to the pro - ns of this act. directly or indirectly, through or by its agents. srs or employees, by uny special rate, rebate, drawback, or other :e, shall charge, demand, collect or receive from any person, firm irporation, a greater or less compensation for any ssrvice r;ndered, i be rendered by it, than it charges, demands, collects or receives any other person, firm or corporation for doing a like and contem- Deous B*rrice, the same shall constitute an unjust discrimination, h is hereby forbidden and declared to be unlawful." ■ The only exceptions to this provision are found in subdivision g of same section, which is as follows: § "Nothing in this act shall prevent the carriage, storage, or handling eight free of charge or at reduced rates for the state, or for any city, ty or town government, or for charitable purposes, or to and from and expositions for exhibition thereat." I It seems plain that, while the provisions of this law apply to t le - ne companies which are included under the term "common carrier," exception referred to applies only to the handling of freight and does refer to telephone service. The Commission, therefore, construes law to mean that no special rate, rebate, drawback or charge of any I other than the regularly scheduled charges on file in the office he Railway Commission shall be collected or received from any on, firm or corporation for telephone service, and that free service &gt;t permissible in any case except in the matter of employees referred bove.

            <seg id="p247">247 Lincoln, Neb., Sept. 2, 1908. U.T. J. ri . TboiQ&amp;s, Burton, Neb I Dear Sir: Replying to your inquiry as to whether a freighter by son is governed by the anti-discrimination clause of the Railway nmUsion Act, will say that he is not unless his charge is published the railroad tariffs as a part of the freight rate to the nearest road point. I Ordinarily a freighter by wagon is not bound by the same re - ctions as a railroad company and other common carriers, for the son that he enjoys no special privileges such as right of eminent lain, etc., that result in the creation of a monopoly. A monopoly is •ossible in such business for the reason that if reasonable service equal terms is not given by one person, another person or associa - 1 of persons will step in and create competition. iThe legislature which created and defined the powers and duties of i Commission evidently intended that its powers should extend over le but common carriers which enjoy special privileges from the ernment, and therefore until said powers have been extended the legislature or otherwise interpreted by the courts, the Commis - l will not assume to exercise jurisdiction over carriers by wagon. enclose herewith a copy of the Railway Commission Act for further information.

Can they keep a person off the train if he tenders them the money and gives the conductor the privilege to give him the change when he gets to a place where he can get it? I had a little incident like this happen the other day and the conductor claimed that the agent did not have to make the change and that he did not have to let them on the train without a ticket regardless of how much money they tendered him and that he could go off and leave a person if he was unable to get his ticket. Thanking you for this information, I am. Very respectfully. A. V. SHOUBOE. Lincoln, Sept. 9, 1908. Fk. F. Shouboe, Cashier Peoples Bank. Upland, Neb.

"But as a condition precedent to the existence of this right of expulsion for the refusal to procure a ticket or to pay the higher fare, an opportunity at least reasonable and such as the statute requires, where a statute exists, must have been afforded by the carrier to the passenger, not himself in fault, to provide him with the required ticket. If. therefore, no office be kept or opened at tbe proper time, nor other ticket facilities be provided for the purpose of supplying passengers with them, or if the office provided for the purpose be closed before the Urn? fixed by law or by the rule of the carrier, and for either reason the passenger has been unable to obtain a ticket, the higher rate cannot be lawfully demanded. And if, without having afforded such proper facilities to the passenger, the carrier should exact from him the additional charge for carriage without a ticket, the former may sue for and recover tbe amount bo paid above the established rate when a ticket is purchased, and if upon his refusal to pay it he be ejected, wh n he is ready and offers to pay his fare at such established rate, his expulsion will be illegal and he may recover damages for the Proper facilities for making change would undoubtedly be construed by the courts as a necessary preliminary to the opportunity to which the passenger is entitled to provide himself with a ticket referred to above. Should he be ejected from a train as the result of being unable to secure a ticket under such circumstances, a suit for damages would in all probability be sustained.

I Dear Sir: Replying to your inquiry of 9th inst. in regard to charg - a graduated scale of rates based upon amount of &amp;t.ock held Id your pany: »The Commission, on August 14th, made the following informal Dg in response to numerous similar inquiries from telephone panies In regard to the legality of making a lower schedule of rates stockholders than for non-stockholders: "The practice of certain telephone companies making a schedule of rates applicable to persons holding stock therein and another higher schedule of rates for nonstockholders, is of doubtful legality. In the opinion of the Commission the same rates should be charged to stock - holders and non-stockholders alike, and any returns to stockholders upon their investment should be paid in the form of dividends rather than in preferential rates." No ruling has ever been made bearing directly upon your second Inquiry as to whether it is unlawful to give preference of territory to stockholders over non-stockholders, but I am inclined to believe that the same principle as is contained in the above ruling would apply, and that such preference would constitute a violation of the antl-dl* - -criminatlon clause of the Railway Commission Act.

            <seg id="p250">250 |:h the railroads of Nebraska are allowed to make for sites for ele - irs, coal sheds, corn cribs, and etc. It was formerly the custom of C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. to make a charge of $5.00 for a lease for five ■s, which charge I supposed was made for the purpose of making the e valid. The last lease which I obtained from the above railroad pany, which was in 1906 for my present location, was made out an indefinite time and the charge was $5.00, which I was advised simply to cover cost of making out the lease. Now the C. B. ft leople have requested me to surrender this lease so that they may e a new one dating from August, 1907, and for which they will e a charge of $5.00 per year up to the present time and in the re. As you are of course aware, these leases have no money value to a roan operating an elevator for they simply give to the lessee the right to put an elevator on the right-of-way. The railroad company are freed from any responsibility on account of fires which their loco - motives may cause and at the same time the lessee is bound to route all shipments over their lines and he may be forced at any time and without any cause to remove his elevator from said right-of-way. In view of all these facts I think this charge should be only a Dominal one, since for most all other classes of shipments the railroads have to maintain their own loading facilities. I cannot see why, with all the conditions which the railroads put in their leases, the man who ships grain and furnishes his own equipment for loading, should be re - quired to pay for using the right-of-way any more than the man who ships live stock and for whom the railroads maintain yards, scales, windmills and etc. I trust you will give this early consideration and favor me with Empt reply. I am willing to pay whatever other elevator men are g in Nebraska and if this is the price that all are paying with your approval I will pay it although I consider it excessive. Yours truly. R. E.

"Also, please give us your opinion as to what relation rates estab - llahel by this Commission between the present time and July 8, 1907, would bear to the rates provided for in Senate File 325 after the same becomes effective as aforesaid." In answer to your first interrogatory, I submit that as Senate Tile 325 does not contain any direction as to when the act shall take .effect, it will be of no force until the expiration of three calendar months from the adjournment of the session. Therefore you have no right to take official notice of this law prior to its taking effect. After the expiration of that time the law will be in force, and your Com - mission can then act thereunder and conduct the hearings for which It provides. </seg>

This, however, would not dispense with the notice to common carriers required by House Roll 305. Such hearings or investigations could receive no legal sanction from Senate File 325 if held before July 8, or when that act takes effect. . I As to your second question, it is my opinion that you can fix and :rlbe rates under the provisions of House Roll 305 at any time ivlng the required notice and hearing, and that the rates thus fixed Id take effect and remain in force until changed or modified, but Id the rate be higher than that fixed by Senate File 325 the rat* by that act would take effect with that law and so remain until ifled or changed by you, as provided in that act. After the ig effect of that act the two acts would have to be construed thtr, practically as one law, unless it should be found that one he other could not stand.

Thompson, Attorney General, Lincoln, Neb. Dear Sir: Subdivision a of Section 5, House Roll 305, provides: "When any railway company, common carrier, or any person in his own behalf, or in behalf of any class of persons similarly situated, or any firm, corporation or association or any mercantile, agricultural or manufacturing society, or any body politic or municipal organization, shall make complaint to the Railway Commission that any rate or rates fixed by said Commission in said schedule or in any subsequent revised or modified schedule or the rate charged or published by any railroad company, is unreasonably high or low, unjust or discriminating, the Board of Railway Commissioners shall immediately fix a da' for hearing the same, and shall cause notice thereof containing the sul stance of the complaint to be served upon the railroad company, comm n carrier, or other person or persons hereinbefore named, complaining, and the rail - way company or common carrier complained of, and the day and date upon which said hearing will be had upon said complaint; provided that said Commission may proceed upon their own motion to have a hearing with reference to revising, modifying or annulling any or all rates in any schedule or schedules prepared by them, by notifying all persons interested therein or affected thereby, as hereinbefore provided." Will you please advise us whether, in your judgment, this Com - mission is authorized, in a case where a certain schedule of rates is proposed and a hearing held as prescribed by law, to adopt another and different schedule than that proposed, provided the evidence offered in such hearing justifies such different schedule in the opinion of the Commission?

            <seg id="p258">258 Lincoln, Neb., August 13, 1907 K Gentlemen: I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your municatlon of August 12th, submitting the following question and ng advice thereon: In a case where a certain schedule of rates is proposed and a hearing held as prescribed by law, has your Commission authority to adopt another and different schedule than that proposed, provided the evidence offered at such hearing Justifies such different schedule in the opinion of the Commission? t Where a rate is proposed by a complaining party and asked to adopted and put into effect, such proposal necessarily implies the existing rate is not a proper rate, that it is too high or too unjust or discriminating and should be changed. In my judgment i a proceeding is in effect a complaint against the existing rates or ■dules in force and opens up the whole question of the rates relative be commodities specified in the proposed schedule for investigation. Subdivision a of Section 5, Chapter 90, of the Session Laws of 1907, among other things provides as follows: t"When any railway company, common carrier, or any person in his behalf, or in behalf of any class of persons similarly situated, or firm, corporation or association or any mercantile, agricultural or ufacturing society, or any body politic or municipal organization, I make complaint to the Railway Commission that any rate or rates by said Commission in said schedule, or in any subsequent re - 1 or modified schedule, or the rate charged or published by any oad company, is unreasonably high or low, unjust or discriminating. the Board of Railway Commissioners shall Immediately fix a day for hearing the same • • • •." ti Subdivision b of said Section 5 provides for a hearing and de - clares as follows: "Tpon the hearing the Railway Commission shall receive any evidence and listen to any arguments offered or presented by either party relevant to the matter under investigation • • • *." * Subdivision c of said Section 5 provides: "After such hearing and investigation, the Commission shall render a decision in the premises, which said decision shall affirm, revise, annul or modify any or all ratee complained of in said original schedule, or any subsequent schedule which may be the subject of investigation • • • •." I To my mind these provisions make It clear that the Railway mission, under the conditions mentioned by you, has authority to t another and different schedule of rates than that proposed. My opinion is that the Commission has full authority and that It is its duty to make and adopt such a schedule of rates for .the transpor - tation of the commodities named in the proposed schedule as from the evidence adduced appears to the Commission to be fair, just and reasonable. Yours very truly. W. T. THOMPSON, Attorney General </seg>

Vance Lane, vice president and general manager of the Nebraska Telephone Co., asking whether the sale of coupon tickets for long - distance service at reduced rates constitutes a violation of the law. Will you please give us your opinion on this matter at your earliest convenience? Very truly yours. NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION. CLARK PERKINS, Secretary. (Enclosure.) Omaha, Neb., October 7, 1907. Hon. State Railway Commission, Lincoln, Neb. K Gentlemen: It has been, heretofore, the practice of Nebraska ■phone Company, and of other telephone companies within the state Nebraska, and generally throughout the United States, to sell pons for long-distance service, giving to the purchaser $120.00, or e, in coupons for $100.00 in money. I The question hag now arisen whether or not this method of accept - compensation for the service is a violation of the law of the state Nebraska as being discriminatory and it is deemed desirable by &gt;raska Telephone Company to have a ruling upon the subject by State Railway Commission in order that companies operating hin the state may be advised. The Nebraska Telephone Company, therefore, hereby reqests the opinion and ruling of the Commission upon the following question: tls it unjust discrimination and unlawful for a telephone company g business in the state of Nebraska to sell coupons for long-distance Ice, good for a specific sum In payment for such service at regular i, accepting from the purchaser, in payment for such coupons, &amp; sum than the amount for which the coupons are good in payment service? ■ A ruling upon this question by the Commission is requested at early date. Yours truly, H. VANCE LANE, Vice President and General Manager. Lincoln, Neb., Nov. 23, 1907. Nebraska State Railway Commission, Lincoln. Gentlemen: I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your communication of recent date, wherein you say that it has been the practice of the Nebraska Telephone Company, and other telephone companies within the state and generally throughout the United States, to sell coupons for long-distance service, giving the purchaser $120.00 </seg>
            <seg id="p260">260 FIRST ANNUAL REPORT or more in coupons for $100.00 Id money. You submit the following question and request an opinion thereon: "Is it an unjust discrimination and unlawful for a telephone company doing business in the state of Nebraska to sell coupons for long-distance service, good for $120.00 In payment for such service at the regular rates, accepting from the purchaser in payment of such coupons $100.00, a less sum than the amount for which the coupon* are good in payment of service?" Section 14 of the Railway Commission Bill, among other things provides as follows: »"If any railway company or common carrier subject to the pro - ns of this act, directly or indirectly, through or by its agents, irs or employees, by any special rate, rebate, drawback, or other :e, shall charge, demand, collect, or receive from any person, firm, irporation, a greater or less compensation for any service rendered, ) be rendered by it than It charges, demands, collects or receives any other person, firm or corporation for doing a like and con - loraneous service, the same shall constitute an unjust discrimina - which is hereby forbidden and declared to be unlawful." I may suggest at the outset that this law only affects matters or messages which are lntrastate. It has nothing to do with inter - state messages. Hence, what is hereinafter stated Is to be understood as relating only to the sale of coupons or the cost of service for intra - state messages. I There Is a custom in vogue in almost all commercial transactions ell a large amount of a given commodity at a less price per pound, I or ton than a smaller quantity of the same commodity. This om is held to be legitimate and one upon which merchants act in case of wholesale and retail transactions. Its legality is based upon proposition that the rights involved in such transactions are usively private rights. (Neither the buyer nor the seller in such transactions is performing blic service. The legal status of a telephone company is different, ilephone company is a common carrier. It performs a public ce. (Webster Telephone Case, 17 Neb. 126; Western Union Tele - h Co. vs. Call Publishing Co., 44 Neb. 326.) In this light its rights obligations must be considered. By reason of the public use to •h It devotes its property there springs the duty of impartial ser - reasonableness and uniformity of rates or charges which may be ted from its patrons. Rates may not be made dependent upon :rary rules or tests. In Webster Telephone Case, supra, the court said: k'^hen a corporation or person assumes and undertakes to ly a public demand, made necessary by the demands of the com - e of the country, such as a public telephone, such demand must ipplied to all alike without discrimination." In the case of the Western Union Telegraph Co. vs. Call Publishing Co., supra, the Supreme Court of this state said: t"It is now the settled law that a telegraph company is a public er of intelligence, with rights and duties analogous to those of a ic carrier of goods and passengers. The law regulating the duties </seg>
            <seg id="p261">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 261 of railroads and other carriers la, therefore, largely applicable to tele - graph companies." In Hayes ft Co. vs. The Pennsylvania Co., 12 Fed 309, it was held: ("Discriminations in the rates of freight charged by a railroad com - to shippers, based solely on the amount of freight shipped, without ■ence to any conditions tending to decrease the cost of trasportation, discriminations in favor of capital, are contrary to sound public y, violative of that equality of rights guaranteed to every citizen, a wrong to the disfavored party, for which he is entitled to recover i the railroad company the amount of freight paid by him in S8 of the rates accorded by it to his most favored competitor, with •est on such sum." tThe holding in this case was approved by the Supreme Court of aska In Western Union Telegraph Co. vs. Call Publishing Co., 44 326. I This same principle was adhered to in the case of Providence Coal vs. Providence ft Worcester R. R. Co., 1 Interstate Commerce Com - ion Rep. 107, wherein the Commission held: I "A railroad company cannot support a discount based on quantity freight received by any one shipper, on the principles which are ilied among merchants, whereby they give better prices in wholesale n in retail dealings. The cases are not analogous, since the naming the quantity of freight that shall be compared to wholesale pur - ses must necessarily be altogether arbitrary, and the duty of lmpar - service which the company owes to the public will preclude special sriminations being determined by arbitrary tests." See also Kinsley vs. Buffalo, N. Y. &amp; P. R. R. Co., 37 Fed. 181 . Under this practice of the telephone company it is doubtless true that coupons good for one hundred and twenty ($120) dollars of ser - vice at regular toll rates are furnished by the company to any one, ■without distinction, paying one hundred ($100) dollars. The fact, however, that before this discount or these more favorable rates can be obtained a sum not less than one hundred ($100) dollars has to be paid, would practically place such discount or special rate beyond the reach of a large per cent of the patrons of the company. Under this practice one paying ninety-nine dollars ninety cents ($99.90) would be urable to obtain this discount, or any discount, or any more favorable rate, while another on paying but ten cents more would be able to secure a discount of sixteen and two-thirds per cent, or a rate that much more favorable. The mere statement of the proposition is sufficient to show that such a practice is arbitrary, unreasonable and Against sound public policy. It savors of a special privilege to the larger against the smaller patron of the company, one of the potential evils aimed at by the law. The payment of one hundred ($100) dollars in advance cannot, in my judgment, be urged in Justification of this reduction of sixteen and two-thirds per cent in regular toll rates. If advanced' payment to a quasi-public corporation could, under any circumstance, be urged as a reason for this reduction, a proposition which is not conceded, I do not think it would be a reasonable justifl- </seg>
            <seg id="p262">262 Em here because the discount granted is disproportionate to the ailing rate of interest or charge for the use or forbearance of ey. With reference to telegraph companies, chapter 89a, Compiled Statutes of 1907, makes an exception as to newspapers and specifically provides that dispatches for publication in newspapers may be for - warded and delivered at reduced rates. I find no authority in the statutes making such an exception as to telephone companies. kl am, therefore, of the opinion that a reduted rate cannot be made pend upon the quantity of service contracted to be furnished, as in case, without violating section 14 of the Railway Commission and the practice named should be discontinued.

Is there any class or kind of merchandise to which the 25 per cent reduction of the rates in force and effect January 1, 1907, con - templated by said act, does not apply? 3.

J. A. WILLIAMS, Commissioner, t Lincoln, Neb., Jan. 9, 1908. Nebraska State Railway Commission, Lincoln. k Gentlemen: I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of communication of January 8, submitting certain questions relative e so-called "Sibley act," being chapter 91 of the Session Laws of , and requesting an opinion thereon. B"l. What merchandise transported by express companies is sub - to the provisions of the Sibley act?" The provisions of the act in question material to your inquiry are contained in sections 3 and 4 thereof. These sections read as follows: t "Section 3. Express companies may charge and receive for the sportation of merchandise within the state of Nebraska any sum exceeding seventy-flvs per cent of the rats as shown in the schedule ided for in section 2 of this act until after the State Railway Com - lion shall have provided a greater rate. "Section 4. Provided, that nothing in this act shall be construed to change the prepaid rates on merchandise weighing one ( 1 ) pound or less, and provided further, that no provision of this act shall reduce any special contract rate in force for the transportation of cream, milk or poultry or any charge to a sum less than fifteen cents; and provided further that nothing in this act shall abridge the authority of the Railroad Commission to make a reduction in any rate provided for In this act." It will readily be seen from the foregoing that section 3 It the substantive part of the act and that section 4 is a limitation upon said section in the nature of a proviso. Section 3 deals with the reduction of express rates for the transportation of merchandise only, and, stand- Ing alone, unqualified by the provisions of section 4, it would reduce the rate for transportation of any and all merchandise twenty-five per cent from what Buch rate was on January 1, 1907. What the word "mer - chandise" includes becomes material to the question submitted. </seg>
            <seg id="p265">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 265 "Merchandise" is defined by Webster to be "the object of com - merce; whatever Is usually bought and sold in trade or market or by merchants; wares; goods; commodities." This definition of mer - chandise has been followed and approved by many courts of this country. (Hein v. O'Connor, (Tex.) 15 S. W., 414; Kent v. Liverpool £ London Ins. Co., 26 Ind., 294; In re San Gabriel Sanatorium Co., (U. S.) 95 Fed., 271.) Under a statute of California, providing that one who agrees to sell merchandise not then in existence thereby warrants that it shall be sound and merchantable at the place of production, the word "mer - chandise" was construed to mean and cover all kinds of personal property ordinarily bought and sold in the market. (Black wood v. Cutting Co.. 76 Cal., 214.) Section 3 of the act in question contains the general proposition that the rates and charges for the transportation by express companies of all merchandise, as above defined, are to be reduced twenty-five per cent. This general proposition finds its only limitation in section 4 The limitation found in section 4 is that the rate is not to be changed or reduced on merchandise weighing one pound or leas, where the charges are prepaid, and that no reduction of rates provided for in section 3 shall affect special contract rates in force for the transportation of cream, milk or poultry, nor any charge not exceeding fifteen cents. In other words, the rate of charge is not reduced on merchandise weighing one pound or less, where the charges are prepaid, nor in cases where a special rate is provided for by any contract In force at the time of the taking effect of said act for the transportation of cream, milk or poultry, nor in cases where the charges for the transportation of mar chandise under the rates In existence on January 1, 1907, does not exceed fifteen cents. I "2. Is there any class of merchandise to which the twenty-five cent reduction of the rates in force and effect January 1, 1907, not apply?" I This question is substantially answered by what has been said erning your first proposition, wherein it is stated that the only i of merchandise, the rate or charge for the transportation of ;h is not intended to be affected and reduced by the Slbley act. Is :handise weighing one pound or less, where the rates for transporta - are paid in advance, and for the carriage of merchandise consisting ream, milk or poultry contracted to be carried for a special rate, re the contract was in force and effect when the act in question effect, and for the transportation of merchandise where the rate l particular shipment In force and effect on January 1, 1907, did exceed fifteen cents. "3. Does the Slbley act in any way affect or reduce the rates in effect January 1, 1907, for the transportation of money between stations In this state by express companies?" This act does not provide for any reduction In rates for the transportation of money. The only connection in which the word </seg>
            <seg id="p266">266 Eney" is used in the act is found in the title and in sections 1 and 2 employed in connection with the schedule of rates and classifications ged for the transportation of money and merchandise within the i, required to be filed with the Railway Commission, and in defining ess companies. your communication you say that express companies divide shipments into three particular classes: t"(l) Money, scheduled as taking money rates. (2) A certain ber of commodities which are classed and scheduled as taking the chandlse rates.' (3) A certain number of commodities trans - °d on a lower basis of rates than the so-called 'merchandise rates' h are open to all persons desiring to ship that particular com mod - such merchandise scheduled as taking what express companies 'general special rates.' " "Putting it another way, such commodities will be transported at a special or lower rate applicable generally to all shippers between the same points at the same rate." Tou submit the question: "Does the Sibley act in any way affect or reduce the 'general special' rate in effect January 1, 1907, as the term 'general special rate' Is defined above?" Answering this question categorically I would say yes. The term "general special rates," according to the definition you give to that ex - pression, doee not amount to a special contract rate mentioned in section 4 of the act or constitute one of the exceptions to the general reduction provided for in section 3 reducing the rates for the transportation of merchandise in force January 1, 1907, twenty-five per cent. I Under your statement that there were no special contract rates feet at the time of taking effect of the act in question, I may say i my opinion that chapter 91 of the Session Laws of 1907 Ides for a twenty-five per cent reduction of the rates in force and t January 1, 1907, for the transportation of eggs, fruits, vegetables, ;, cured and fresh, poultry, poultry food, hides of animals, fish, lard substitutes, seeds, shrubs, stock food, bread, honey, crackers, p, cheese and all other merchandise of every kind and character idtd within the definition of merchandise given above, unless ped in quantities of one pound or less where the charges on ments of one pound or less are prepaid, or where the charges for particular shipment do not exceed fifteen cents.

Nebraska State Railway Commission, Lincoln Gentlemen: I have the honor to advise you that I have examined Into the jurisdiction of the Nebraska State Railway Commission to hear and determine the complaint of A. A. Armitage against the Chicago, </seg>
            <seg id="p267">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 267 Complainant asserts that the railroad company extended its stock yards at Kenesaw to a point within seventy-six feet of his residence and there created, and now maintains, a nuisance which is injurious to the persons and property of himself and family. The Nebraska State Railway Commission is asked to abate this nuisance- by requiring the railroad company to relocate its stock yards at a place suitable for the purposes thereof. No complaint is made of the capacity or sufficiency of the stock yards in connection with the transportation of live stock, of the rates or charges, or of the care or safety of live stock. The only purpose of the complaint is to abate the nuisance and prevent resulting injury. The jurisdiction of the courts to grant such relief is unquestioned, but of the jurisdiction of the Nebraska State Railway Commission there is grave doubt. In my opinion the matter should be presented to a tribunal where the jurisdiction cannot be controverted, and for these reasons I think the Nebraska State Railway Commission should decline to entertain the complaint. Very respectfully, W. T. THOMPSON, Attorney General. W. B. ROSE, Deputy. No. S. Lincoln, March 19, 1908. Hon. W. T. Thompson, Attorney General. I Dear Sir: Enclosed herewith find file of correspondence from the n Pacific Railroad Company in regard to their legal right to limit time for return transportation issued to caretakers of live stock i their regular live stock contracts. I As we understand it, the form attached is not the one now in corn - use, but the form used by the said company at present carries a ty-day limit clause. Refusal to issue transportation to Mr. W. H. terer was based upon the thirty-day rule as carried in the present 1 of contract, although Mr. Winterer's stock was shipped under an form of contract. II am directed by the Commission to ask you whether, in your opin - refund of fare paid in this instance can legally be made; also her the railroad company is within Its rights in fixing a limit for expiration of such transportation under the law which requires .nee of return transportation without specifying a limit. An early reply to th*ee queries will be appreciated. Very truly yours. CLARK PERKINS, Secretary. Lincoln, Neb., April 14, 1908 Nebraska State Railway Commission, Lincoln, Neb. Gentlemen: I have your communication, relative to the legal </seg>
            <seg id="p268">268 . FIRST ANNUAL REPORT to caretakers of live stock. You say that under &amp; contract for the carriage of live stock, entitling a person to transportation from the ■hipping point to the destination of such shipment and transportation back to the point from which the shipment was made, a party presented himself and offered to surrender his contract to the railroad company and demanded return transportation after the expiration of thirty days, which return transportation was refused. You want to know if a refund by the railroad company can legally be made to this party for the amount required to i&gt;e paid for a ticket from, the point of destination of the shipment of live stock to the point from which it was shipped. If there was do time limit for the return transportation in the contract of shipment and no published rules or regulations of the company fixing a limitation for return transportation, I am of the opinion that the rail - road company can legally refund the cost of the return transportation. You also demand an opinion of this department upon the following question: "Is a railroad company within its rights in fixing a limit for return transportation?" The statute authorizing the granting of transportation to care - takers of live stock does not place any time limit upon return transpor - tation. (Sec. 6, Ch. 72, Art. 1, Compiled Statutes of 1907.) Where, in a statute of this nature, or in a contract, an act is required to be done or performed by one party and no definite time is fixed for per - formance, it Is an elementary principle of construction that a reasonable Mm is understood or Implied. I am of the opinion,' therefore, that as the law now stands, and in the absence of a rule or order established by the Nebraska State Railway Commission on the subject, a railroad company has a right to fix a reasonable time limit in its contracts of shipment within which it will, without further consideration, furnish return transportation to caretakers of live stock. Yours respectfully, W. T. THOMPSON, Attorney General. The above opinion was accepted by the Commission and transmitted to Union Pacific Railroad Company as Its ruling on April 14, 1908. No. Lincoln, Jan. 8, 1908. Hon. W. T.

When two common carriers have a junction point, is it within the power of the Railway Commission to compel the originating carrier to deliver a shipment to the destinating carrier without first receiving its freight charges, and await the collection of the originating carrier's freight charges by the destinating carrier? K"2. In such a case, has the Commission the power to compel destinating carrier to pay the advance charges on such shipment to originating carrier upon delivery by the latter of such shipment, prior to the collection of such charges from the consignee? K"3. Is it now lawful for a common carrier to pay or accept advance charges on certain commodities in shipments of this char - r, and refuse to pay or accept the advance charges on other modities in shipments or routings of like character?" It is the duty of all common carriers, whether connecting carrier or not, to accept and transport all gooie properly tendered. The originating carrier may tender goods received from a shipper to the destinating carrier, and the destinating carrier must accept the goods and forward them to destination. In such cases the originating carrier is acting </seg>
            <seg id="p270">270 FIRST ANNUAL. REPORT as the agent of the shipper, and the relationship, the liabilities and the rights do not necessarily change because one railroad may receive freight tendered it by another railroad company which is a connecting common carrier and acting only as the agent of the shipper. One rail - road tendering goods as agent of the shipper may demand whatever the shipper might demand, but it cannot demand more. Any carrier, whether an originating or destinating carrier, has the right to demand pay in advance for the transportation of property before receiving the earn?. A railroad company, whether connecting carrier or otherwise, cannot be required to accept freight for transportation and have the con - dition imposed upon it that it advance back charges to originating car - riers. In my judgment a railway commission cannot impose- the burden upon the destinating carrier to advance the charges due to a forwarding carrier. When goods are received without payment in advance being demanded by the originating carrier, It becomes the duty of such carrier to transport them to their destination or to deliver them to the next rec ivlng carrier. If the charges of the originating carrier are not paid by the destinating carrier, the latter carrier has a lien upon the prop - erty for the cost of transportation and may not deliver the same until the charges of both the originating and destinating carrier are paid. Th? foregoing will answ r the first and second propositions submitted. ■ In Oregon Short-Line &amp; U. N. Ry. v. Northern Pacific R. Co., C. A.) 61 Fed. 158, it was held as follows: t"The provision requiring carriers to afford all reasonable, proper, equal facilities for interchange of traffic, and forbidding discrlm - on between connecting lines (Sec. 3, Cl. 2), is not violated by ving and forwarding, without prepayment of freight or car mileage, of other companies containing goods coming from one locality, refusing to do so, unless prepayment is made, when the goods are a different locality." In Little Rock &amp; M. R. Co. v. St. Louis S. W. Ry. Co. (CCA.) 63 Fed. 775, it was held: "An interstate carrier does not subject another carrier to an 'undue or unreasonable disadvantage' (Interstate Commerce Act, Sec. 3, Cl. 2) by exacting the prepayment of freight on all property received from It at a given statien, although it does not require charges to be paid in advance on freight received from other individuals and com - peting carriers at such station. 59 Fed. 400, affirmed. "An interstate carrier which enters into an arrangement with a connecting carrier for through billing, rating, and loading, and for the use of its tracks and terminals, is not obliged to make the same arrangement with other connecting carriers, though the physical facilities for an interchange of traffic are the same. 69 Fed. 400, affirmed." Kin Little Rock &amp; M. R. Co. v. St. Louis I. M. ft S. Ry. Co. (C. C. 41 Fed. 559, It was held: I "A court of equity has no power, either at common law or under Interstate Commerce Act, to compel a railroad company to enter a contract with another company for a joint through rate and joint ugh routing of freight and passengers." </seg>
            <seg id="p271">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION ■ In Oregon Short-Line ft U. N. Ry. Co. v. Northern Pac. R. Co. C. A.) 51 Fed. 465, It was held: "In the absence of any regulation by law or custom, a railway company receiving freight from a connecting line is not required to advance or assume payment of the charges due thereon for transpor - tation from the point of origin to the point of connection. K'ln the absence of any arrangement between connecting railway anies, there is no obligation on the part of either to honor nger tickets Issued by the other." In Southern Indiana Exp. Co. v. United States Exp. Co., 88 Fed. 659, it was held: I "The rules of the common law do not require a carrier to receive live goods for carriage, either from a consignor or a connecting ler, without prepayment of its charges If demanded, nor to advance charges of a connecting carrier from which it receives goods in the ■se of transportation; nor can it be required to extend such credit or :e such advances to one connecting carrier because it does so to On the third proposition, I am of the opinion that since a common carrier may accept or refuse to receive or accept all shipments offered until its transportation charges are tendered, it may lawfully accept the advance charges on certain commodities and may refuse to pay or accept the advance charges on other commodities on shipments or routings of like character. The principle Involved In this proposition is largely one of extension of credit. There may be many commodities which a railroad company might reasonably accept for transportation without demanding the payment of its transportation charges in advance and rely upon the article transported and its carrier's lien thereon for its pay, while other articles, such as perishable goods, could not safely be looked to as security for the payment of its charges. Yours respectfully, W. T. THOMPSON, Attorney General. COURT DECISIONS. kin the Matter of an Action in Quo Warranto, Brought in th - eme Court of Nebraska by the Attorney General Under Legislative lution to Test the Validity of the Amendment to the State Oon - tion Creating the Railway Commission, Etc. ISEDGWICK, C. J. The Attorney General, pursuant to a resolution the house of representatives, filed an information in gaa irarranto this Court to test the right of these respondents to hold the office of te Railway Commissioner and to discharge the duties of that office. ? first question presented to the Court is as to the validity of the con - utional amendment submitted at the last election. The determination this question depends upon the meaning and application of the first tlon of article 17 of the constitution, which is as follows: "Either inch of the legislature may propose amendments to this constitution. </seg>
            <seg id="p272">272 FIRST ANNUAL REPORT and If the same be agreed to by three-fifths of the members elected U&gt; each house, such proposed amendments shall be entered on the journals, with the yeas and nays, and published at least once each week in at least one newspaper In each county, where a newspaper is published, for three months immediately preceding the next .election of senators and repre - sentatives, at which election the same shall be submitted to the electors for approval or rejection, and if a majority of the electors voting at such election adopt such amendments, the same shall become a part of this constitution. When more than one amendment is submitted at the same election, they shall be so submitted as to enable the electors to vote on each amendment separately." There is no dispute as to the facts, which are as follows: The resolution to submit an amendment of the conetltution was introduced in the senate of 1905, and was known as "Senate File 196." The senate journal of that year records that on February 15th, the thirtieth day of the session, "Senate File 196. Proposed Amendment to the Con - stitution of the State of Nebraska" was introduced and read the first time. When the yeas and nays were entered upon its passage in the senate, 30 senators voted in the affirmative and none in the negative; 3 being absent. The enrolled resolution was signed by the president of the senate, and by the speaker of the house, and approved by the Governor, and deposited in the office of the Secretary of State. It appears at page 791, Ch. 233, of the Session Laws of 1905. ' We have f xamined the printed copies of the journals of the respective houses and also the original records, and consider that a discussion of such matters as are shown in the stipulation of facts presented by the parties to this litigation will dispose of all substantial questions presented by these records so fair as we have observed. The stipuation of facts upon which the case Is submitted recites that: "On October 4, 1906, Hon. John H. Mickey, Governor of Nebraska, issued his proclamation that on November 6, 1906, there would be a general election held at the usual places of voting for the election of state and district officers and the adoption or rejection of the proposed amendment to the constitution with respect to the State Railway Commission. A copy of the proc - lamation is filed herewith, marked 'Exhibit 1,' and made a part hereof. Said election was also for the election of senators and representative*, and legal notice thereof was given and posted as required by law. Under the direction of the Secretary of State the proposed constitutional amendment was published in at least one newspaper in each connty prior to November 6, 1906, which publication contained a notice of the submission of the proposed amendment to the electors for adoption or rejection, but the notice was published in only one newspaper in Logan county, to-wit, th* Logan County Pioneer, and the first publication was not made until the issue of the paper dated August 9, 1906, and the last publication was made November 1, 1906. The only publication of the notice in Lancaster county was made in the Lincoln Daily Star, the first publication being Saturday, August 3, 1906, in the Saturday </seg>
            <seg id="p273">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 273 Issue of that newspaper, and the notice was published only in the Saturday issue of that paper during the three months next preceding November 6, 1906. The Lincoln Daily Star is a dally newspaper published seven days in the week. The only publication of the notice in Dodge county was made In a newspaper published in Fremont, known as the Fremont Tribun-e, the first two notices being published In the Tri-Weekly Tribune and the others in the Daily Tribune for the remainder of the three months next preceding November 6, 1906, the tri-weekly and daily being editions of the same paper, published at the same office, by the same publishers. The only newspapers in which the notices were published In Custer county the Callaway Queen, a weekly paper published at Callaway, and the Ansley Chronicle-Citizen, published at Ansley. The first notice in the Ansley Chronicle-Citizen was not published until the issue of that paper dated August 10, 1906, and the first notice of the proposed amendment in the Callaway Queen appeared in a sup - plement of that paper printed August 4, 1906. The only newspaper in which the notice was published in Brown county was the Ainsworth Star Journal, a weekly paper published at Ainsworth, and the first Issue of that paper in which the notice was published was a spscial edition of the paper printed Saturday. August 4, 1906. The only publications In Keith and Rock counties of the propose! constitu - tional amendment were made in the Keith County News, and the one In Rock county in the Rock County Leader, and the first publication was made August 5, 1906, in special editions of the papers, a copy of the one In Rock County Leader being hereto attached and made a part hereof, and marked 'Exhibit 3,' and the notice subsequently ap - peared in the regular weekly editions, the first publication in the weekly edition being August 9, 1906. The notice was published in Dixon county In th? Northern Nebraska Journal, a weekly news - paper published In the city of Ponca, and the first publication appeared in a special edition of that newspaper issued Saturday, August 4, 1906. The first notice published In Otoe county appeared in a supplement dated August 3, 1906, a copy pt which is hereto ritached and marked 'Exhibit 4.' In the other counties of the state t" e notice was published in at least one weekly newspaper once each week for the three months next preceding November 6, 1906." I The stipulation also shows that the three principal political ties of the stats in their state conventions each "nominated thr?e didates for the office of State Railway Commissioner, and «ach Its respective platform, duly adopted by said conventions, declared favor of the approval and adoption of th? proposed constitutional end men t and the declaration becam? and was made a part of the tforms of these political parties." This action of the political tfcs "was duly certified to the Secretary of State by the chairmen I secretaries of the respective conventions, and the question of the iroval or reaction of the proposed amendment and the election of </seg>
            <seg id="p274">274 FIRST ANNUAL REPORT the Railway Commlsioners was printed upon the official and cample ballots, as shown by the sample ballot hereto referred to and attaouci hereto, and the ballots so printed were voted at the general election throughout the state November 6, 1906. • • • The total number of votes cast at the election was 194,692 ot which 147,472 votes were In favor of the adoption and approval of the proposed amendment, by counting in favor of the amendment all the straight party votes of the Republican, Democratic, aDd People's Independent Parties, and also the votes where a cross was made in the square at the right hand •lde of the ballots opposite the words 'For constitutional amendment with reference to State Railway Commission,' and not otherwise." The votes were duly canvassed, and "thereafter, on November 27, 1906, Hon. John H. Mickey, Governor of Nebraska, issued his proclamation declaring the amendment to be a part of the constitution of the state." 1. The first point, presented by the Attorney General is that the proposed amendment was not "published once each week in at least one newspaper In each county where a newspaper Is published for three months immediately preceding tbe election at which it was submitted to the voters as required by section 1, Art. 17, of tbe constitution." (Laws 1903, p. 40.) The facts above quoted from the stipulation show that there has not been a literal compliance with this clause of the constitution. The election was held on the 6th day of November. The three months named in the constitution are three calendar months, and would include the period of time commencing with the beginning of the 6th day of August (McGinn v. State, 46 Neb. 427, 65 N. W. 46, 30 L. R. A. 450, 50 Am. St. Rep. 617), and to comply literally with this provision the first publication must be before that day. There was but one paper published in Logan county, and it appears that the proposed amendment was not published in that county until August 9th, four days later than the limit prescribed by the constitu - tion. This is the most serious irregularity disclosed in the matter of publication. It is therefore unnecessary to discuss other irregularities, because, unless this failure in Logan county to comply with the letter of the constitution requires us to 'conclude that the amendment Is invalid, the other specified irregularities, which are of a less serious nature, are not sufficient to require such conclusion. The question whether the provisions of the constitution may under any circumstances be considered as directory merely has been very much discussed by the courts of this country. In many cases it has been said that all of the provisions of the state constitution must be considered as mandatory. Judge Cooley in his work on Constitutional Limitations Introduces his suggestions upon this question by a concise statement of the rules for the construction of statutes in determining in what cases statutory provisions are to be considered as mandatory, and In what cases directory merely. After stating the rules of the construc - tion of statutes in this regard, the learned author says: "But the courts tread upon very dangerous ground when they venture to apply </seg>
            <seg id="p275">275 the rules which distinguish directory and mandatory statutes to the provisions of a constitution. Constitutions do not usually undertake to prescribe mere rules of proceeding, except when such rules are looked upon as essential to the thing to be done and they must then be regarded in the light of limitations upon the power to be exercised. It Is the province of an instrument of this solemn and permanent character to establish those fundamental maxims, and fix those un - varying rules, by which all departments of the government must at all times shap^ their conduct; and, if it descends to prescribing mere rules of order in unessential matters, it is the lowering the proper dignity of such an Instrument, and usurpiDg the proper province of ordinary legislation. We are not therefore to expect to find In a constitution provisions which the people In adopting it have not re - garded as of high importance, and worthy to be embraced in an instrument which, for &amp; time at least, is to control alike the government and the governed, and to form a standard by which Is to be measured the power which can be exercised as well by the delegate as by the sovereign people themselv.es. If directions are given respecting the times or modes of proceeding in which a power should be exercised, there is at least a strong presumption that the people designed it should be exercised in that time and mode only; and we impute to the people a want of due appreciation of the purpose and proper province of such an instrument when we infer that such directions axe giv&gt;en to any other end. Especially when, as has been already said, it is but fair to presume that the people in their constitution have expressed themselves in careful and measured terms, corresponding with the immense importance of the powers delegated, and with a view to leave as little as possible to implication. There are some cases, however, where tha doctrine of directory statutes has been applied to constitutional provisions; but they are at variance with the weight of authority upon the precise points considered, and we do not think, therefore, we should be warranted in saying that the judicial decisions as they now stand sanction the application." TJiia is strong language from one of the greatest constitutional lawyers that this country has ever produced. From a careful exam - ination of Judge Cooley's language, it appears that he has not attempted to say that no case could arise in which the courts would be justified in inquiring into the purpose and intention of a constitutional provision in determining the application to be made and the force to be given the language used. Establishing a constitution Is the work of the whole people. By this means they place limitatione upon the powers of their servants, and also In some respects place limitations upon themselves. There is, of course, no doubt of the power of the sovereign people to change their own work at pleasure, but the people must act by major - ities, and in adopting the constitution the majority which did so has prescribed the method by which the majority of the people may alter or amend it. When an amendment is proposed, the minority may </seg>
            <seg id="p276">276 FIRST ANNUAL REPORT say to the majority: "You have placed certain limitations upon your power to change our fundamental law. W &gt; insist upon those limita - tions being observed." No doubt the majority is bound to observe such limitations. An attempt by the majority to change the funda - mental law in violation of the self-imposed restrictions would be held Ineffectual. Should it be held that the people have, by the language use.l in their fundamental law, placed such restrictions on themselves as might result in prohibiting any amendment, however it might be desired by the great mass of people, and however much the officers and tenants of the people might endeavor to comply with those restric - tions? The limitation in question, with the construction contended for, might be so used. There are but few voters in Logan county. Hut one newspaper was regularly published therein. If some accident :d the control of the publisher should prevent the publication of the paper in which this notice should first have been published, or if some oversight, or some inducement offered to the publisher, had caused the notice to be omitted from that publication, the people of the whole state, although practically unanimous, would be powerless to ramedy the defect. If the purposes of the publication had been fully served in other ways, if the proposed amendment had been dis - cus-ad by the people of Logan county generally, if all of the voters of the county had participated in the election, and if their vote in favor of the proposed amendment had been practically unanimous, still the result would be the same. The will of the people of the state would be defeated by an unimportant accident over which they had no control. If other provisions of the constitution are mandatory and are to be taken literally, those provisions by which the people have consented to place restrictions upon their own power in adopting ami ndments to the constitution should not be so construed. We should inquire into the fair purpose and meaning of such restrictions and should regard the substance rather than the letter of such re - quirements. Such conditions as now confront us were evidently not m r idered by the learned jurist whose language we have quoted. This particular limitation upon the power of the people to anund their own fundamental law, clothed in the same language* as is contained in our own constitution, has been construed by the Supreme Court of Kansas in an opinion written by Justice Brewer in Prohib - itory Amendment Cases, 24 Kan. 700, and, 'while we should have hesitated to use some of the language contained in that opinion, we think that, so far as it relates to the precise question presented here, it correctly applies the language of our constitution. Indeed, this Court is already, so far at least, committed to the language there ueed by tfc&lt;? opinion of this Court in re Senate File 31, 25 Neb. 864, 41 N. W. 981. In the opinion in that case, at page 885, the following language Is r.uoted with approval from the opinion of Justice Brewer above referred to: "The two important, vital elements in any constitutional amendment are the assent of two-thirds of the legislature and a </seg>
            <seg id="p277">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 277 majority of the popular vote. Beyond these, other provisions are machinery and forms. They may not be disregarded, because, by th m, certainty as to the essentials is secured. But they are not themselves the essentials. Take a strong illustration: The constitution requires that the 'Secretary of State shall cause the same to be published in at least one newspaper in each county of the state where a newspaper is pub - lished, for three months preceding,' etc. Suppose a unanimous vote of both houses of the legislature, and a unanimous vote of the people in fa - vor of a constitutional amendment, but that the Secretary had omitted to publish in one county in which a newspaper is published, would It not be simply an insult to common sense to hold that thereby the will of the legislature and the people had been defeated? Is it within the power of the Secretary either through ignorance or design to thwart the popular decision? Is he given a veto, or can he create one? This may be an extreme case; but It only illustrates the principle." After quoting this and other language of Justioe Brewer, this Court by Maxwell, J., said: "The case cited from Kansas seems to state the law correctly and has our approval." We have examined many cases arising in other jurisdictions holding a contra./ doctrine, among them several cases from California, and State v. Tooker, 37 Pac. 840, 15 Mont. 8, 25 L. R. A. 560, cited by the Attor - ney General. This latter case quotes largely from several strong opinions of other courts and from the language of Judg,e Cooley not d in this opinion and fortifies the position taken by reasons worthy of consideration. The force of this case aa authority here, however, is very much weakened by two causes. In that case there was no sub - stantial compliance with the constitution. The proposed amendment nu published "but for two weeks before the election." And* the crn - stitution of that state ordains that all of its provisions "are mandatory and prohibitory unless by express words declared to be otherwise " The Court in Its opinion quoted with approval the language of the Supreme Court of California in construing a similar clause of thrir constitution, as follows: "We will add here that under our constitj - tion no question can be made whether the provision in it for its ameni - ment is mandatory or directory. That question Is settled by the constitution itself, which ordains in the most solemn form and ma that each and all of its provisions are mandatory and prohibitory, unless by express words declared to be otherwise. Article 1, 22. This ?er - tion, in our judgment, not only commands that Its provisions shall be obeyed, but that the disobedience of them is prohibited. (Paring Co. v. Hilton, 69 Cal. 512, 11 Pac. 3.)" We do not think that the Irregu - larities shown in the matter of the publication of this proposed amendment In the various counties of the state should be held to defeat the amendment. 12. The next objection to the validity of the amendment suggested the Attorney General Is that there was no authority for electing te Railway Commissioners, and that no such office existed, at the </seg>
            <seg id="p278">278 time of the general election in 1906. Upon the first proposition, it Is sufficient to say that the constitution provides that, when an amendment is proposed by the legislature, the same shall be submitted to the electors for approval or rejection at the next election of senators and representatives, and, as to the manner of submitting it, prescribes only that, "when more than one amendment is submitted at the same election, they shall be so submitted as to enable the electors to vote on each amendment separately." (Section 1, Art. 17, above quoted.) If the amendment has been submitted to the voters at the general election specified and the manner of its submission does not violate the only limitation which the constitution provides, it may well be presumed that the intention of the constitution is that it shall be submitted as other questions are, and that the legislature intended that the means of ascertaining the will of the people upon other questions at the general election at which it is required to be submitted should be employed. It will be conceded that, where there is no office, there can be no officer. Constitutions and amendments thereto are created by the vote of the people, and not by a canvass of that vote, nor by the official declaration of the result. If this amendment was adopted, it was when a majority of the electors had voted in its favor, and, when that occurred, it became a part of the constitution and the office of State Railway Commissioner existed. By the same act of the people that made the amendment a part of the fundamental law, and created the office, these respondents were elected to fill that office. Both matters might properly be submitted to the electors at the same election. This is in accord with universal precedent both in this and in other states. The practice was introduced into this state by the sixth section of the enabling act. (Comp. St. 1903, 114.) 3. The third question submitted by the Attorney General is stated as follows: "Is there authority of law for counting for the constitu - tional amendment the straight party vote of the Republican, Demo - cratic and People's Independent Party?" In 1895 a statute was enacted providing for the submission of constitutional amendments when two or more were proposed. (Sess. Laws 1M5, Ch. 5, p. 69.) The title of the act is: "An act prescribing the manner in which two or more proposed amendments to the constitution are to be submitted to a vote of the people and providing for the printing and distribution of ballots containing such proposed constitutional amendments." The two principal things accomplished by this act were to require the state to furnish the official and sample ballots for submitting such amend - ments, and to enable the voter to "vote for or against all the proposed amendments or questions printed on the ballot, by simply making a cross mark (X) opposite the word 'Yes' or 'No,' according to the answer he wishes to give." Section 5 of the act, however, provided: "It ■hall be the duty of the county commissioners of each county to provide a separate ballot box for each voting precinct in which to deposit the ballots provided for in this act." This section was not complied with </seg>
            <seg id="p279">279 In submitting the amendment In question, and it is suggested that thii Invalidates the amendment. The act of 1895, however, has no appli - cation in this case, since but one amendment was submitted, and that art was intended to apply only when two or more amendments were submitted. In 1901 an act was passed by the legislature amending 12 sections of chapter 26 of the compiled statutes of 1899, the general election law. (Laws 1901, p. 337, Ch. 29.) Among the sections so amended was section 127, which provided for making nominations to office. The amendment consisted in inserting the following provision: "A state convention of any political party may take action upon any constitutional amendment, which is to be voted upon at the following election, and said convention may declare for or against such amend - ment, and such declaration shall be considered as a portion of their ticket to be filed with the Secretary of State and by him certified to the various county clerks." Also section 129 was amended. This section related to the manner of certifying nominations to the proper oflWrs and the amendment to this section consisted in inserting the following provision after stating what the certificate of nomination shall conta ■, "Also any party action taken relative to any proposed constitutional amendment, whether for or against, shall be in writing and shall form a part of such certificate." And also provided that certificates of nomination of candidates for certain offices "or any party action taken relative to any proposed constitutional amendment shall be filed with the Secretary of State." Section 135, which is also amended, required the Secretary of State to certify nominations to the county clerk of each county, and, as amended, after providing other things to be stated In the certificate, contained the following: "And also any proposed constitutional amendment or party declaration relative thereto, or other ouestion to be submitted to the people of the state for popular vote." Section 140, which related to the form of official ballot, was also amended, and was made to contain the following: "Whenever the Secretary of State has duly certified to the county clerk questions to be submitted to the vote of the people, the county clerk shall have printed below the names of all candidates upon the regular ballots the question in such form as will enable the elector to vote upon the question so presented. On constitutional amendments submitted to the voters, where a 'For' or 'Against' vote Is required, and where any political party has in state convention taken action as a party either for or against such amendment, the county clerk shall have the name of such political party printed directly after the words 'For' or 'Against' as the case may be so as to plainly indicate to the voter the stand taken by such party on such amendment, as shown in schedule 'A' of section 160." Section 146, which provided for furnishing the ballots to voters and for Instructions to the voter, was also amended so as to contain the following: "If he wishes to vote a straight party ticket he shall make a cross in the circle at the right of the name of his party at the head of the ballot, and his vote shall be considered as a vote for every </seg>
            <seg id="p280">280 FIRST ANNUAL REPORT candidate and endorsed constitutional amendment of that party on the ballot. If the voter does not wish to vote a straight ticket he shall make a cross in the square to the right of every candidate for whom he desires to vote, or, in a presidential election, by making a cross in the circle to the right of the presidential electors of his choice; if he desires to vote for all the electors of one party, or by writing the name of the person for whom he desires to vote, and whose name is not printed on the ballot, in the blank space provided therefor and making a cross to the right thereof; and in case a question be submitted to the vote of the people, by making a cross in the square to the right of the answer he wishes to give. When a voter shall have made a cross In one of the circles for a straight party ticket, and shall have also made crosses in any of the squares to the right of the name of any candidates or in either square to the right of any constitutional amendment his vote shall be counted as a vote for said candi - dates and for or against said amendments, as the case may be, but for all other offices or constitutional amendments his vote shall be counted for the candidates and party action concerning amendments of tbe party in whose party circle he has made a cross." The requirement of tbe constitution is: "When more than one amendment is sub - mitted at the same election, they shall be so submitted as to enable the electors to vote on each amendment separately." The objection that the pro-visions of our statute above quoted are not such "as to enable the electors to vote on each amendment separately" when several amendments are submitted appears to be without foundation. The voter may vote a straight party ticket if he desires, but he is not compelled to do so. He may vote a straight party ticket in general and make such exceptions as he desires either as to the individual candi - dates or as to any proposed constitutional amendment. The directions for so doing in the statute appear to be practicable and without uncer - tainty. It is not the duty of the Court to suggest methods of submitting crnetitutional amendments to the vote of the people. The duty of devising and applying such methods is devolved' upon the legislature, and, unless the method adopted by the legislature is manifestly a viola - tion of the constitution, and unless it clearly appears that the method adopted by the legislature will not make it practicable for the voters to express their judgment as to each amendment proposed, the courts are not at liberty to disregard the will of the legislature. A similar method of submitting constitutional amendments has been upheld by the Supreme Court of Ohio, (State €X rel. Sheets v. Laylin, 69 Ohio St. 1, 68 N. E. 574.) It was evidently the intention of the legislature by enacting the amendments to the election law embraced in the act of 1901 (Laws 1901, p. 337, Ch. 29) to revise the provisions of the statute in regard to the form of the ballot and the manner of voting in the submission of constitutional amendments. We do not think that the failure to repeal section 5 of the act of 1895 should result in thwarting this desigr. The provisions contained in the latter act are complete In </seg>
            <seg id="p281">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 281 themselves and cover the whole general subject, and ought to be regarded as the final expression of the legislative will. The record ■hows that this amendment was submitted to the electors by a practically unanimous vote of the legislature, and that the merits of the amendment were thoroughly discussed throughout the state and well known to the voters, and it was adopted by a very large majority Of all the voters participating in the election 4. The Attorney General suggests "that the entire proposed amendment to the constitution should be printed in full upon the official ballot." Of course, there is no ground for such a supposition. The provision of the constitution is that the- amendment shall be sub - mitted to the electors for approval or rejection, but this does Dot require that the whole amendment bo submitted shall be upon the ballot. Enough was printed upon the ballot to identify the amendment referred to and to show its character and purpose, and that is all that is required. The respondents are citizens and qualified electors of the state, and ■appear to have properly qualified pursuant to their election. We con - clude that the constitutional amendment in question has been regularly adopted, and has become a part of the constitution of the state, and that the respondents are the legally elected and regularly qualified State Railway Commissioners. The information is therefore dismissed. §ln the Matter of an Action to Mandamus Certain Judges of the ed States Circuit Court to Remand the Case of State of Nebraska . H. &amp; Q. Ry. Co. to the Supremo Court of Nebraska, Brought by Attorney General in the United States Supreme Court. FULLER, C. J. The motion to remand presented for decision the question whether there was in the case a controversy wholly between citizens .of different states., to the complete determination of which the state of Nebraska was not an indispensable party. If defendant's contention was correct, the action could have been originally brought In the federal court, and its jurisdiction of the case was complete on removal. The circuit court was called upon to determine that question aDd to exercise judicial discretion in deciding it. This being so, its Jurisdiction was complete; and if it erred in its conclusions the remedy Is not by writ of mandamus, which cannot be used to perform the office of an appeal or writ of error. The applicable principles have been laid down in innumerable cases. (Ex parte Bradley, 7 Wall. 364, 19 L. ed. 165; ex parte Loring, 94 U. S. 418, 24 L. ed. 165; re Rice, 155 U.

The Wabash Railroad Company filed a petition to remove the case to the circuit court of the United States for the southern district of New York. The petition for removal alleged that there was, In the cause, a controversy wholly between citizens of the different states, to the determination of which controversy the defend - ants, citizens of the state of New York, were not indispensable or necessary parties. The cause was removed and Pollitz made a motion to remand, which was denied. Pollitz applied to this Court for a writ of mandamus directing the remanding of the cause to the state Court. The rule was eDtered, and a return was made to the effect that the order denying the motion to remand had been made and entered into the exercise of the jurisdiction and judicial discretion conferred upon the circuit judge by law, and for the reasons expressed in the opinion filed with the order. The rule was discharged and the petition dismissed, and the Court •aid (330): "The suit was commenced In the state Court by a citizen and res - ident of the city, county and state of New York against a corporation, a citizen of the state of Ohio, and other defendants, many of whom were residents and citizens of the state of New York, the value of the matter in dispute, exclusive of Interest, and cost, exceeding the juris - dlctional sum. "The defendant, the Wabash Railroad Company, a citizen of Ohio, filed its petition and bond in proper form for the removal of the suit Into the United States circuit court for the southern district of New York, on the ground of separable controversy so far as it was concerned, and it. was removed accordingly. A motion to remand was made and denied by the circuit court, which held that the controversy was sep - arable, and that the other defendants were not indispensable or necessary parties to the complete determination of that separable controversy.

I "In re Hohorst, supra, the bill was filed In the circuit court of the ted States for the southern district of New York against a corpora - and certain other defendants, and was dismissed against the corpo - on for want of jurisdiction. From that order complainant took an &gt;al to this Court, which was dismissed for want of Jurisdiction because order, not disposing of the case as to all the defendants, was not lal decree from which an appeal would lie. (148 U. S. 262, 37 L. 443, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 590.) Thereupon an application was made to Court for leave to file a petition for a writ of mandamus to the ges of the circuit court to take jurisdiction and to proceed against company in the suit. Leave was granted and a rule to show cause »red theron, upon the return to which the writ of mandamus was rded. (Re Atlantic City R. Co. 164 U. S. 633, 41 L. ed. 579, 17 . Ct. Rep. 208.) "In ex parte Wisner, Wisner, a citizen of the state of Michigan, commenced an action at law in the circuit court for the city of St. Louis, state of Missouri, against Beardsley, a citizen of the state of Louisiana. After service of summons on Beardsley he filed his petition to remove the action from the state court into the circuit court of the United States for the eastern district of Missouri, on the ground of diversity of citizenship, with the proper bond, and an order of removal was made by the state court, and the transcript of record was filed In the circuit court. Wisner (who had had no choice but to sue in the state court) at once moved to remand the case, on the ground that the suit did not raise a controversy within the jurisdiction of the circuit court, and that, as it appeared on the face of the record that plaintiff was a citizen and resident of Michigan and defendant a cit - izen and resident of Louisiana, the case was not one within the original Jurisdiction of the circuit court, in accordance with the statute pro - viding that where jurisdiction is founded only on the fact that the action is between citizens of different states, suit shall be brought only in the district of the residence of either the plaintiff or the defendant. The motion to remand was denied, and Wisner applied to this Court for a writ of mandamus, which was subsequently awarded. t"In the present case the removal was granted and sustained on the nd that there was a controversy between the removing defendant plaintiff, which could be fully determined as between them without presence of the other defendants.

(Missouri P. R. Co. v. Fitzgerald, 160 U. S. 556, 582, 40 L. ed. 536, 542, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 389.)" I If this case is one wherein there was a controversy wholly between ens of different states, to the complete determination of which r parties to the record were not indispensable or necessary, then, removal being properly sought on that ground, the federal court jurisdiction. If the state of Nebraska was not an Indispensable r by reason of its Interest in the controversy, its presence on the rd as a plaintiff would not defeat the jurisdiction of the federal t. And to the circuit court was committed the decision of those tions in the first instance, the correctness of which cannot be exam - upon this application. We must add that the mere presence on the record of the state as a party plaintiff will not defeat the jurisdiction of the federal court when it appears that the state has no real interest in the contro - versy. And in the present oass the circuit court was not bound to adjudicate the question merely by an inspection of the nominal partite to the record, for the mere presence of the state of Nebraska as a party plaintiff was not of itself sufficient necessarily to defeat the jurisdiction of the federal court. It became, and was, the duty of the circuit court to determine the question whether the state of Nebraska tu an actual party plaintiff in the present suit, and to determine that ion by consideration of the nature of the case as presented by the whole record, and not "by a reference to the nominal parties to the This the circuit court did, and, from an inspection of the entire record, for the reasons stated in the opinion filed, the court held that, although the state- of Nebraska was a nominal party plaintiff on the record, yet it had no real substantial legal interest in the controversy. The complaint alleged that the Nebraska State Railway Commission was charged with the duty to regulate proper and lawful intrastate rates upon the railroad lines in the state of Nebraska, and to enforce thereon all lawful Intrastate rates and charges for the transportation of passen - gers and freight and to prevent discrimination in such intrastate freight and passenger rates and charges; and alleged the duty of the Attorney General to bring all suite necessary for that purpose; the suit had for its object and purpose merely the securing of an Injunction against tb* defendant company, to restrain that company from charging for the transportation of freight and passengers within the state of Nebraska more than the rates fired by the state authority for' that purpose, and from disobeying orders of said Nebraska State Railway Commission and from concealing from said Commission the true condition of its business, and from making any unlawful discrimination in issuing intrastate passes, mileage tickets, and transportation within the state of Nebraska </seg>
            <seg id="p285">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 285 Tbe question whether the state of Nebraska is the real party plaintiff must be determined from the consideration of the nature of the case as disclosed by the record. If the naturs of the case is such that the stats of Nebraska is the real party plaintiff, the federal court will so decide for all purposes of jurisdiction, even though the state were not named as a party plaintiff. If the nature of the case is such that the state is not a real party plaintiff, the federal court will so i for the purposes of jurisdiction, even though the stat is named nominally as a party plaintiff. The question whether such a case as this Is one in which the state is the real party in interest and the real party plaintiff was deter - mined by this Court in Missouri K. &amp; T. R. Co. v. Missouri R. ft Warehouse Commrs., 183 U. S. 53, 46 L. ed. 78, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 18. where the only question presented was whether, in a suit brought to enjoin a railroad company from charging greater rates within the state of Missouri than those fixed by state authority, the state of Missouri was the real party plaintiff. The stat; was not joined as a party plaintiff, but the question had to be determined, not by a view of the nominal parties to the record, but from the consideration of the nature of the case as shown by the whole record. The defendant com - pany presented to the stat; Court a petition for removal, which was denir-d. The Supreme Court of the state held that it was proper to go behind tbe face of the record and inquire who was the real party plaintiff; and, after making such examination, decided that the state was the real party plaintiff, and that the federal court hai no jurisdic - tion on the removal. The case wae brought to this Court for a r of the decision of the Supreme Court of Missouri, and this Court, recog - nizing the rule that a mere inspection of the parties named as the plain - tiffs was not conclusive, examined the record and the nature of the case, and in an opinion rendered by Mr. Justice Brewer, held that the nature of the. case was such that th. state of Missouri was not a real party in interest and not a real party plaintiff. The Court analyzed the nature of the proceeding, showed that there was nothing in such an action which affected the state as such, and that the relief sought did not inure to the state alone, and that a decree in favor of the plaintiff would not eff;ctively operate in favor of the state. I The circuit court might clearly have been correct in its d:cision tbe present case was one in which the state of Nebraska was not real party plaintiff, but that decision could not be reviewed by damus. I The circuit court was called upon on this record to decide whether state of Nebraska had any real or legal interest in the controversy iged to have been wholly between citizens of different stat?s; and It i a decision which the court had a right to make, involving no abuse judicial discretion. A premature review cannot be obtained by a t of mandamus. </seg>
            <seg id="p286">286 Without expressing any opinion as to whether the state was a necessary party to the relief asked, which Involved the removability ot the case, this Court bases its judgment on the mandamus entirely upon the ground that, as the circuit court had jurisdiction to pass upon the question of the removability of the case, and as its order overruling the motion to remand was subject to be reviewed by a higher Court after the case had been disposed of by final judgment, the remedy was by appeal, and not by mandamus. Rule discharged; petition dismissed. I Memorandum Opinion in the Matter of a Motion to Remand Salts Enforcement of Slbley Ijaw, Reducing Express Rates Twenty-five Cent, from Supreme Court of Nebraska to United States Circuit IW. H. MUNGER, D. J. The Legislature of this state passed an act, ch was approved April 5, 1907, providing, amoDg other things, that express companies doing business within the state should, within ty days after the passage and approval of the act, file with the lway Commission a complete schedule of the rates and classifications rged for the transportation of money or merchandise within this e by such company, which was in force on the 1st day of January, D. 1907; that said express companies should not charge and sive for the transportation of merchandise within the state of Ne - ska any sum exceeding seventy-five per cent of the rate, as shown he schedule before provided for, until after the Railway Commission II have provided a greater rate. tOn the 5th day of July. 1907, the state of Nebraska brought an in in the Supreme Court of the state for an injunction to enjoin express company from violating this provision of the statute. In time the defendant express company filed in the Supreme Court tie state its petition and bond for removal, alleging that the express pany was a citizen of another state and that a federal question was ented. The present hearing is upon a motion to remand. I Under the judiciary act, to entitle a party to remove on the iund of diversity of citizenship, there must be a controversy between zens of different states. A state is not a citizen, within the meaning the judiciary act, but it is argued that, as the state has no interest the controversy which entitles it to maintain the action, therefore. Is a mere nominal party. We have just held in the case of^ the State of Nebraska and the Board of Railway Commissioners against the C. B. &amp; Q. Railroad Com - pany, brought in the Supreme Court of the state for a like purpose, and removed into this court, that the action was a removable one on the ground of diverse citizenship, for the reason that the state, though named as a party complainant, had not such an interest as entitled </seg>
            <seg id="p287">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 287 it maintain the actiOD, and hence was a mere nominal party; that real controversy was between the Board of Railway Commissioners, :horized by statute to maintain the action) and the railroad com - r. In this case, if there is a controversy at all, it Is one between state and the express company. Whether such controversy can be ntained by the state, it is unnecessary for us to decide. We are to determine whether or not there is a controversy between ens of different states. Finding that there is no such controversy, case was not removable on the ground of diversity of citizenship. I It Is claimed further that, as the act did not have an emergency ise, it did not, under the provisions of the constitution go into ct until the 5th day of July, and that the defendants were not aired to put into effect the reduced rates until thirty days thereafter; t the action, being brought on the 6th day of July, was prematurely ught, and therefore presents a federal question. We cannot agree this contention. The mere fact that an action is prematurely ught cannot be said to present a federal question within the mean - of the judiciary act. If that should be so in a case of this racter, it would be so in every action brought by one individual lnst another prematurely, to recover upon a promissory note or other se of action. For the reasons given, the motion to remand is sustained and the case remanded to the Supreme Court of the state. In the Matter of an Application for an Injunction to Restrain Various Express Companies from Violating the Sibley Law by Charging Higher Rates than Seventy-five Per Cent of Those in Effect January 1, 1907, Brought by the Attorney General in the Supreme Court of Nebraska. LETTON, J. On July 5, 1907, the Attorney General filed, in the name of the state of Nebraska, petitions against the Adams Express Company and four other express companies doing business in this state, alleging In substance that the defendants are common carriers engaged in carrying on an express business over various line* of rail - road in the state of Nebraska. That the legislature of 1907 passed the following act, known as Senate File 355: "An act to provide for the filing of schedules of rates charged by express companies for the transportation of money or merchandise within the state of Nebraska; to fix a maximum charge for such service; to provide for the enforcement of the provisions of this act; and for penalties for failure to comply with its provisions.

That it is the duty of the defendant to obey the statute and put in force the rates fixed by the legislature in said act, but that the defendant has put in force unlawful -charges and rates for intrastate transportation of merchandise .within the state of Nebraska and Is exacting from the people of the stats of Nebraska unlawful, exorbitant and unconscionable rates and charges; that individual citizens who are Interested are unable to cope with the defendant and that it is the duty of the state to protect the people from the unlawful, exorbitant rates and charges exacted by the defendant. The prayer is for an injunction to prevent the defendant from making or putting into effect any other or different charges from those prescribed in the act or from interfering with or attempting to change the rates and charges established by law for its services. tAn answer was filed which contained among other things an ;ation that the law was not effective on July 5, 1907, on account of having been passed with an emergency clause. LThe Attorney General filed a motion to strike this part of the an - on the ground that, under the provisions of section 7 of the act. </seg>
            <seg id="p289">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 289 which provides "this act shall take effect on and after Its passage and approval," the act took effect as soon as passed and approved by the Governor upon April 5, 1907. I The motion to strike was overruled, the Court being of the opinion the act failed to comply with that part of section 24, article f the constitution, which provides: "No act shall take effect until e calendar months after the adjournment of the session at which issed, unless in case of emergency, to be expressed in the preamble ody of the act, the legislature shall, by a vote of two-thirds of all members elected to each house, otherwise direct;" and that the act, efore, did not take effect until three calendar months after the •urnment of the session. By consent, this answer of the defendant company has been withdrawn and an answer in the nature of a plea in abatement has been filed in order to present certain preliminary questions, which, if the contention of defendant is upheld, would abate the action. In sub - stance it is pleaded that the state of Nebraska has no power or authority under the constitution and laws of the state to maintain the action; that the Supreme Court has no jurisdiction; that the petition does not show whether the defendant is a person, association or corporation; that the rates charged at the tiro: the suits were begun were those in force prior to the 1st day of January, 1907, and that the rates provided for in the act were not in force and effect at the commencement of the present suit and that the defendant was under no duty under the terms of the act to charge the rates therein provided for. For convenience, we will consider the first and second points together. The defendant asserts that the state of Nebraska has no power or authority under the constitution and laws of this state to maintain the suit and that this Court has no jurisdiction, while the Attorney General maintains that the state may maintain a suit in equity in this Court to protect the general welfare by protecting the public from oppressions, extortions and other injuries, though the state of Nebraska has no pecuniary or property interests in the suit. Section 22, article 6, of the constitution provides: "The state may sue and be sued, and the legislature shall provide by law in what manner and in wha't courts, suits shall be brought." Section 2, article 6, relating to the Supreme Court, provides: shall have original jurisdiction In cases relating to the revenue, cases In which the state shall be a party, mandamus, qua irarravto, w corpux and such appellate jurisdiction as may be provided by Referring to that clause of section 22 which provides that the legislature shall provide by law in what manner and in what courts suits shall be brought, it was held in State v. Moores, 56 Neb. 1, and also in re Petition of Attorney General, 40 Neb. 402, that even though the provisions of section 2 may not be self-executing, still, that they have already be&lt;&gt;n sufficiently supplemented by legislation so that the i </seg>
            <seg id="p290">290 FIRST ANNUAL REPORT legislature hu actually provided by law in what manner suits by the state should be brought, aa required by section 22, article 6. But it is contended that the state Is net properly a party in this case, and it is argued that no suit can be instituted by the state In the exercise of ita constitutional powers or "sovereign capacity" except such suit is expressly provided for by statute, that the act in question haa, by its terms, imposed upon the executive department the duty of iu enforcement and that it is, therefore, beyond the power of the Attorney General to shift the burden of executing the law from the ex - ecutive to the judicial department. That section 6 of the act provides, "the Nebraska State Railway Commission, and, if there be no Commis - sion, then the Governor with the assistance of the Attorney General, are hereby empowered to enforce the provisions of this act," and therefore, tbat the Railway Commission 1b the only .body vested with authority to enforce the provisions of the act. It is to be noticed, however, that no powers are conferred upon the Railway Commission by the statute with respect to the enforcement of the law other or greater than those given to private individuals. There is no procedure specified by which that body may act directly on the offending carrier. The Railway Commis - sion, if it seeks to enforce the law, must travel the same road as any private citizen, appeal to the courts for relief, or for the punishment of the carrier who violates the law. The main question presented by defendant's argument is whether the state of Nebraska, in behalf of its citizens concerned with the transportation of merchandise, may apply to this Court in an original suit in which it has no pecuniary interest for relief from unjust exactions and extortionate charges made by express companies engaged as common carriers within the state. It is alleged in the petition that the defendant is carrying on Ita business over various line of railroad in the state of Nebraska for hire and is continually transporting money and merchandise for a money consideration in cars other than freight cars and on trains other than freight trains, between stations and between towns and places in the state of Nebraska. The defendant then is a public service corporation engaged in transacting business for the public over the public high - ways of the state of Nebraska. The railroad companies over whose lines of railroad its business is transacted have had conferred upon them a certain portion of the sovereignty of the state of Nebraska, the right of eminent domain, so that they might exercise it for public purposes. Such railway companies may carry on in their own corporate capacity the carriage of goods and chattels, money, merchandise or any other articles which are susceptible of carriage by railroad transpor - tation, or they may permit subordinate agencies, either personal or corporate, to engag 1 ? in the transportation of money or merchandise over their lines under special care and in a more expeditious manner than if enrrird upon ordinary freight trains. TIih rights, the liabll- </seg>
            <seg id="p291">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 291 Hies and the duties of the defendant, therefore, as a common carrier, are measured by the rights, liabilities and duties of the railroad company over whose lines it operates and within the boundaries of the limited field of transportation within which the express company carries on its energies. The express company cannot be held liable for any violation of the duties of the original carrier in a department or sphere with which It ia not concerned in the conduct of its business, but within the limited scope of the field of transportation which is now occupied exclusively by express companies, their relation to the public as common carriers is the same as that of the railroad company. The fountain cannot rise higher than its source, and the express com - pany and the railroad company are both subject to state control and reasonable regulation. The right of regulation by the state of the business of common carriers, especially of those to whom has been granted the right of eminent domain, is beyond discussion. The doc - trine has dow become so well established as to become one of the fundamentals of the law. (Wisconsin M. &amp; P. R. Co. v. Jackson, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 115; Atlantic Coast Line v. North Carolina Cor. Com., The grant of the right of eminent domain implies the consideration that the tolls, rates and charges to be made to the public for the use of the railroad shall be just and reasonable, and not extortionate, and that no unjust discrimination shall be made. The power and author - ity which granted the franchise to the railroad company to become a corporation and to exercise the right of eminent domain and take private property for public use, even against the will of the owner, Is the same power which is exercised to promote the public safety by requiring the lin&lt;es to be fenced, road crossings to be made, cattle guards constructed, which regulates the transportation of live stock, prohibits the exaction of unreasonable and exorbitant charges for the carrying of passengers and freight. In granting the franchise the state did not surrender or abdicate its sovereignty nor set in operation a power or agency which it thereby lost the right to control. This Idea was firmly planted in our constitution at Its birth and the courts have consistently preserved its benefits to the people of this state. (State v. R. V. R. R. Co., 18 Neb. 512; C. B. ft Q. R. Co. v. State, 47 Neb. 549; State v. Mo. P. R. Co. filed this day.) tThe defendant says "it is only permissible to the state, in any sdictioD, even in the absence of constitutional or legislative author - to litigate in its sovereign capacity, cases involving the jeopardy he public health or the public peace. No well considered case can ound holding to the contrary." Elsewhere, in the brief of counsel, oncedes that the state may maintain actions in which It has a iniary Interest. But we think that the state has not thus abrogated powers or denied itself one of the most powerful agencies for ascertainment of fact and the application of a remedy, if needed, natters that affect the regulation and control of public franchises. </seg>
            <seg id="p292">292 FIRST ANNUAL REPORT A sufficient answer to this contention is fouDd in the following quoUtion from the opinion of Justice Brewer, In re Debs, 39 L. ed. U. S. 682: » "Every government, entrusted by the v;ry terms of Its being powers and duties to be exercised and discharged for the general .re, has a right to apply to its own courts for any proper assistance e exercise of the one and the discharge of the other, and it is no lent answer to Its appeal to one of those courts that It has no - ilary interest in the matter. The obligations which it is under omote the interest of all and to prevent the wrong doing of one ting in injury to the general welfare is often of itself sufficient to it a standing in court." In Stockton v. Central R. R. Co., 50 N. J. Eq. 52, 78, it is said: "The inquiry is, whether the Attorney General may invoke the power of this Court to restrain further operations under and in pur - suance of, the lease. It is well settled that where a corporate excess of power tends to the public Injury or to defeat public policy it may be restrained in equity at his suit. In Attorney Gen ral v. Delaware ft Bound Brook R. R. Co., 12 C. E. Gr. 631, 633, in pronouncing the opinion of the Court of Errors and Appeals, Mr. Justice Dixon said: 'In equity, as in the law court, the Attorney General has the right, in cases where the property of the sovereign or the interests of the public *re directly concerned, to institute suit by what may be called civil information for their protection. The state is not left without redrew Id its own courts, because no private citizen chooses to encounter the difficulty of defending it, but has appointed this high public officer, on whom It has cast the responsibility, and to whom, therefore, it has given the right of appearing in its behalf and Invoking the judgment of the court on such questions of public moment.' Professor Pomeroy, in his work on Equity Jurisprudence. Sec. 1093, states the rule in this lan - guage: 'When the managing body are doing or are about to do, an ultra virfs act of such a nature as to produce public mischief, the Attorney General, as the representative of the public and of the govern - ment, may maintain an equitable suit for preventive relief.' " tin Trust Co. vs. Georgia, 109 Ga. 751, though the Court held that r the facts the lower court erred in granting the injunction, refully reviewed the authorities and said upon this point: t"Our conclusion, therefore, both from reason and a decided weight uthority Is that the state. In her sovereign capacity, can appeal to courts for relief by injunction, whenever either its property is in - ed, or public Interests are threatened and jeopardized by anr oration; especially one of a public nature like a railroad company.

            <seg id="p293">NiLioxvAo&amp;A STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 293 Kublic interests the action will lie, citing a number of English cases pport the proposition. In Attorney General v. Great Northern R. Co., 1 Drewry &amp; Smale 161, it was said by Vice Chancellor Kinderfley: k'The only remaining question is this: Whether, if the interests e public are injured or endanged by the practice complained of, it mpetent for the Attorney General, eat ojka or on relation, to file formation to prevent it. "On this point I entertain no doubt whatever. Whenever the interests of the public are damnified, by a company established for any particular purpose by act of parliament, acting illegally and in con - travention of the powers conferred upon it, I conceive it is the function and duty of the Attorney General to protect the interests of the public by an information; and that where, in the case of any injury to private interests, it would be competent for an individual to apply for an injunction to restrain a company from using its powers for purpose* not warranted by the act creating it, it is competent for the Attorney General in cases of injury to public interests from such a cause, to file an information for 'an injunction. The cases in which the Attorney General comes forward on behalf of the public, to ask this Court to restrain a nuisance, are an illustration of this principle. A Duisance may be detrimental to the public or to an individual; and it is very usual for the Attorney General to come forward for an injunction to restrain it, so far as it affects the public, just as an individual may apply for an injunction to restrain it, where it affects himself. It is true that every injury is not a nuisance; but the right of the public to be protected against Injury by the information of the Attorney Gen - eral, is not confined to those injuries which may come within the strict definition of a nuisance. Where it is the interest of the public to prevent an illegal act, such as this, being committed, it is competent for the Attorney General to file an information to restrain it." The whole subject of the power of the state to maintain an action such as this in the Supreme Court of a state having similar constitu - tional provisions to those of this state is considered in a learned and exhaustive opinion by Chief Justice Ryan, which is one of the landmarks ■of modern jurisprudence, in Attorney General v. R. R. Cos., 35 Wis., 425, 511, and both the right of the state to maintain the action and the jurisdiction of the court to entertain it are clearly demonstrated. The subject is also discussed in Green's Brices, VMrm Virm, 706, where the authorities are collected. t While there are cases announcing doctrines which may not be ■ntire harmony with these, we believe that, if for no other reason, marvelous development of franchised public service corporations ing the present generation demands that of two opposing policies t one should be adopted which leaves the state most unfettered in powers of regulation and control and most free in adopting speedy adequate means of safeguarding the public interest by direct action, ecessary in the court of last resort. tBut it is said that, under the terms of the act, the State Railway mission, and not the Attorney General, has been designated as the sr to enforce the law and that the Attorney General is not orized to maintain the suit. The petition recites, however, "Comes </seg>
            <seg id="p294">294 FIRST ANNUAL REPORT now the state of Nebraska, by its Attorney General, William T. Thowipton, by and with the consent and authority of the Nebraska State Railway Commi**ion, and for cnuae of action, etc." This allega - tion Is not denied and must be taken as true. It, therefore, appears that the action is brought by the Attorney General, by the authority of the Nebraska State Railway Commission, the particular officers con - nected with the executive department of the state government, who are specially empowered by the act itself to enforce its provisions. It may be said further that, under the provisions of the statute, specifying the power and duties of the Attorney General, it is the duty of the Attorney General to appear for the state and prosecute all actions In the Supreme Court in which the state shall be interested or a party, and he may on his own motion bring and prosecute for the state any suit, matter or thing, civil or criminal, in which the state is interested or relating to any matter connected with the executive department. Irrespective of what the powers of the Attorney General might have been at common law, as the law officer of the crown, under this pro - vision, the power and duty of determining when an action shall be brought by the state or In the interests of the state in this court devolves upon the Attorney General as fully and to as great an extent as upon the Governor or any other officer of the executive department. When in the exercise of the powers thus conferred upon him by the constitution and the law, the Attorney General determines that the Interests of the state require an action to be brought in this Court, no question can arise as to his authority to institute or maintain the suit, if It is a matter in which the state is interested or relating to the executive department. If, in his judgment, there is good cause to believe that any public service corporation, the regulated and fixed charges of which for services rendered to the public under its franchise Have been disregarded, or that unreasonable, extortionate and ex - cessive charges have been made for public service it becomes his duty, as a member of the executive department of the state to institute proceedings before the judicial department of the government, whereby the rights of the state, exercised in behalf of all the peo - ple, may be preserved and vindicated. This Is a well recognized power and duty of such an officer both in England and in this country. I We have no hesitation, therefore, in holding that in all civil b in which the existence or regulation or control of a public fran - e, the grant of which carries with it any exercise of a portion of sovereign power of the state is concerned, this Court has original idiction at the suit of the state, or of the Attorney General in lU of the state. To hold otherwise would be to divest the state of most efficient manner of exercise of its regulatory and super - ry powers over the instrumentalities which it has created for Its public purposes, which we cannot believe it ever was the intentioa be makers of the organic law to do. In the opinion of Mr. Commissioner Ryan, in re Petition of Attor- </seg>
            <seg id="p295">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 295 ney General, 40 Neb. 402, 410, it was said: t"Such jurisdiction will not be entertained by this Court In cams rein the state is but a nominal party. Tbe case must be such that state as a real and substantial party has a direct interest in having rmined." But as has been pointed out In a number of the opinions, portions of which are quoted herein, a public wrong may consist of almost innu - merable instances of private wrong and that is especially true if Jt la a wrong of a nature which affects the rights of the people living in almost every city, town or village in the state as well as those living upon farms and ranches. The express companies now rival the post - office in the extent of their operations and possibly actually transact business for as many or more different persons in the course of a year than the railroad companies do. We think, therefore, that in cases such as this where the people of the whole state are inter - ested in the charges made for carriage upon public highways by common carriers, the state has a real and substantial interest and the jurisdiction Of this Court is undoubted. §The objection that the petition does not show whether the defend - is a person, association or corporation probably should have been e by motion to make more specific. At all events, we think it is too in the progress of this case to raise it now. to the contention that the suit was prematurely brought, sections d 3 of the act are, as follows: "Section 2. (Schedules of Rates.) Within thirty days after the passage and approval of this act, all express companies doing business In this state shall file with the Railway Commission, a complete schedule of the rates and classifications charged for the transportation of monev or merchandise within this state by such company, which was in force on the first day of January, A. D. 1907." "Section 3. (Rates.) Express companies may charge and n for the transportation of merchandise within the state of Nebraska any sum not exceeding seventy-five per cent of the rate as shown in the schedule provided for in section 2 of this act until after the State Railway Commission shall have provided a greater rate." The defendant's contention is that the direction that an express company shall file a schedule of rates in force January 1, 1907, "within thirty days after the passage and approval of this act," must be con - strued as meaning within thirty days after the act became a law, and that the act became a law on July 5; that the legislature intended the companies to .have thirty days within which to prepare schedules after the law became effective, and that the rates provided for did not go into effect until thirty days after the filing of the schedules. It is our view that the legislature Intended to adopt and did adopt the rates and classifications charged for the transportation of money or merchan - dise on the first day of January, 1907, as a basis or standard of com - parison for the new rates and that under the provisions of section 3, of the act, it became unlawful, after the act took effect, for an express company to charge or receive for its services in this state, any greater sum than seventy-five per cent of the rate in force upon January 1, 1907. </seg>
            <seg id="p296">296 FIRST ANNUAL REPORT It cannot be reasonably contended that it was the intention of the legislature that the rates set forth in written schedule filed should be taken as the basis or as anything more than evidence of the rate which was actually charged on January 1. If, by mistake, the schedule filed showed a rate other than that actually charged, it would be unreasonable to say that a rate "as shown by the schedule" should be taken as the basis, as a narrow and literal reading of the act would require, and not the rate which was actually charged and in force on the 1st day of January, 1907. We are of the opinion that the true interpretation of the meaning of the act is that a rate not exceeding seventy-five per cent of the rates charged on the first day of January, 1907, became the lawful rate as soon as the act took effect, but that thirty days thereafter waa allowed the express companies to file with the Railway Commission a complete schedule of the rates and classifications in force on January 1, 1907. To so interpret the act places no harsh or unreasonable burden upon the express companies by way of requiring new schedules and classifications to be made within such a short period of time as tt&gt; necessitate undue haste in preparation, or such as to require the employment of extra assistance before the rates could easily be ascer - tained, since the only process necessary for their agents to perform in order to ascertain the lawful rate after the act took effect was to deduct .twenty-five per cent from the rates in force upon January 1, 1907. But r cognizing the difficulty and the necessary time required to prepare new written or printed schedules of rates and classifications of the multi - farious articles of merchandise carried by express, the legislature wisely provided the space of thirty days in which to prepare and file such schedules before a penalty for non-compliance with this direction should be imposed. iAs soon as the act became operative, the rates prescribed took :, but the time to file the schedules extended for thirty days lafter. The action, therefore, was not prematurely brought. ■ We conclude, therefore, that the Attorney General had authority bring suit in the name of the state; that this Court has jurlsdlc - 1 and that the action was not premature. The plea in abatement is, therefore, overruled.

H. MUNGER, D. J. This action was commenced in this Court l bill of complaint filed on the 10th day of July, 1907, the object purpose of which was to enjoin the defendants from enforcing of the provisions of an act of the legislature of the state of raska, approved April 5, 1907, known as Senate File No. 355, being &gt;ter 91 of the Session Laws of 1907, which act provided that all ■ess companies within this state should, within thirty days after the </seg>

The act further prohibited express paoies from charging to exceed seventy-five per cent of the rate rn in such schedule. The act provided a penalty for its violation required the State Railway Commission or, if there should be no mission, then the Governor, with the assistance of the Attorney »ral, to enforce the provisions of the act. On July 5, 1907, the state commenced an action in its Supreme Court to enjoin the defendants from violating the provisions of that act. I Upon the commencement of the case in this Court, an application i made for a temporary order of injunction, pending the final .ring and determination of the cause, it being alleged in the bill that enforcement of the act would result in depriving complainant of property, without due process of law. The defendants upon the ring on the application for a temporary order of injunction, showed the satisfaction of the Court that they had not done, and did not template enforcing the penal provisions of the statute until It should determined by a court of competent Jurisdiction that the statute i a valid statute. I Proceedings were had in the state Court until April 7, 1908, when ;mporary restraining order was issued by said Court, enjoining ndants from violating the provisions of this statute. Subsequent to restraining order granted by the state Court, the defendants, mem - of the State Railway Commission, Issued an order, designated as sr No. 12, requiring the express company, beginning with April 1, I, to furnish said Railway Commission a monthly report of the ness done and expenses incurred at each office operated by said pany in Nebraska. Complainant now renews its motion for a tem - xy order of injunction, asking particularly, among other things, the defendants be restrained from enforcing said Order No. 12. It appears from the record that the defendants have been pro - ceeding in an orderly way in a court of competent jurisdiction to have the validity of the statute in question determined and adjudicated. This they have a right to do, and should not be restrained from doing it. Order No. 12 is not based upon any provisions of the statute in ques - tion. The right to issue the order. If it exists at all, is by virtue of the provisions of an act of the legislature, commonly known as the Railway Commission Act. As the suit pending in this Court only seeks to prevent the enforcement of said act, being chapter 91 of the Session Laws of 1907, and to have that statute declared unconstitutional, as depriving the complainant of its property without due process of law, the object and purpose of that suit is not broad enough to restrain the order of the Commission complained of. Indeed, if the said legislative enactment should be declared unconstitutional, and the defendants enjoined from enforcing any of Its provisions, such judgment would </seg>
            <seg id="p299">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 299 not prevent tbe Railway Commission from requiring the information called for by Order No. 12. As said, there is nothing in the record showing Chat the defendants have done, or are threatening to do, any act looking to the enforcement of the statute in question, excepting to obtain in a court of competent jurisdiction an ascertainment of its validity, which is a proper step for the defendants to take before seeking to enforce its penal provisions. »The application for a temporary order of injunction or restraining r is therefore denied. This applies, also, in Cases No. 21-22-23 and Docket "Y." Memorandum Opinion in the Matter of an Application by C. B. A Q. R. R. Co., for an Order Restraining the Nebraska State Railway Commission from Further Reducing Freight Rates on Grain. T. C. MUNGER, D. J. An amendment to the constitution of Ne - braska, adopted November 6th, 1906, reads as follows: i "There shall be a State Railway Commission, consisting of three iibers, who shall be first elected at the general election in 1906, &gt;se term of office, except those chosen at the first election under i provision, shall be six years, and whose compensation shall be fixed the legislature. Of the three Commissioners first elected, the one jiving the highest number of votes, shall hold his office for six years, next highest four years, and the lowest two years. The powers I duties of such Commission shall include the regulation of rates, rice and general control of common carriers as the legislature may vide by law. But in the absence of specific legislation, the Comtnis - l shall exercise the powers and perform the duties enumerated in ! provision." Following the adoption of this constitutional amendment, the legislature of Nebraska passed an act defining the powers and duties of the Railway Commission, which was approved and took effect March 27, 1907. (Session Laws Neb., 1907, Ch. 90.) Among other provisions of the act are the following: Section 2. (b.) "Said Commission shall have the power to regulate the rates and services of, and to exercise a general control over all railroads, express companies, car companies, sleeping car com - panies, freight and freight line companies, and all other common carriers engaged In the transportation of freight or passengers within the state." t Section 2. (d.) "Said Commission shall have the power and It I be its duty to make all necessary classifications and to fix all ssary rates, charges and regulations to govern and regulate the ;ht and passenger tariffs of railway companies and common carriers, power to correct abuses and prevent unjust discriminations, extor - i and overcharges in rates of freight and passenger tariffs on the rent railroads in this state, and to enforce the same by having the .lties inflicted as hereinafter provided, through proper courts having idlctlon." Section 2. (e.) "Said Commission shall have the power, and It shall be its duty, to fairly and justly classify and subdivide all freight and property of whatsoever character and description that may be trans- </seg>

The legislature of Nebraska also passed an act, approved April 8, 1907, containing the following provisions: t"It shall bs unlawful for any railway company or common carrier, rating or doing business in the state of Nebraska, to charge, collect receive for the transportation of live stock, potatoes, grain and in products, fruit, coal, lumber, or building material in carload lots, iln the state of Nebraska, more than eighty-five per cent (85%) of amount fixed in the classification and schedules of such railway ipanies or common/ carriers for the transportation of such prop - • in force and effect on their various lines of railway on the first of January, 1907, until after the State Railway Commission shall e provided a greater rate upon any article or property in such Mlules from the rates herein fixed. "The State Railway Commission shall have the power to hear and determine whether or not the freight rate upon any article or articles in such schedule or classification of rates is either so high as to be unjust to shippers, or so low as to be unremunerative or unjust to any common carrier affected thereby, and upon complaint, in writing, of any person or corporation affected thereby, particularly specifying the article or articles upon which such rates are either too high or too low and the facts in connection therewith, said Railway Commission shall set such cause for hearing and upon a trial thereon and a full hearing after notice thereof, shall either raise or lower the rate therein fixed upon such article or articles, to the end that the same shall be just and rea - sonable to all parties concerned." — Session Laws Neb., 1907, Ch. 95, Sec. 1 and 2. The complainant railway company, by its bill in this case filed against the members of the State Railway Commission, alleges that the Railway Commission served a notice on complainant that on Septem - ber 9, 1907, it "will consider the question of fixing the rates on grain and grain products in straight carloads, transported between points within this state, and the rates hereto attached will be adopted, with such changes and modifications as may be deemed necessary, unless good and sufficient cause is shown why they should not be." The schedule attached set out the proposed rates. The complainant alleged that the adoption of such rates would in effect regulate Interstate commerce, and would be conflscatory of complainant's property, and an injunction is asked to restrain the Commission from putting into effect or attempt - ing to establish the proposed schedule of rates, and from attempting in any manner to reduce the rates to be charged by the complainant, and from giving notice of any such order by the Commission. An applica - tion for a temporary Injunction and a counter motion to dissolve the restraining order have been submitted, together with a demurrer to complainant's bill. I From the showing made, it appears that the Railway Commission a the hearing provided for by the notice, but have not concluded •r made any finding or order thereon. </seg>
            <seg id="p301">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 301 It is claimed that the proper construction of the constitutional amendment does not give power to the Railway Commission to fix or establish freight rates, but only to correct discriminations. This con - tention is founded upon the use of the word "regulate" in the amend - ment, as distinguished from the establishing of rates provided by a provision of the original constitution (Art 11, Sec. 4). It is also claimed that the constitution is not to be construed as giving legislative power to the Railway Commission. Under the constitution of the United States, coDgress is given the power "to regulate commerce" among the several states. Iln Interstate Commerce Commission vs. Cincinnati, etc., Ry. Co., IT. S. 478, in construing this section of the constitution, and the r granted to the Interstate Commerce Commission under the existing act of congress, it was said: "There were three obvious and dissimilar courses open for consid - eration. Congress might itself prescribe the rates; or it might commit to some subordinate tribunal this duty; or it might leave with the companies the right to fix rates, subject to regulations and restric - tions, as well as to that rule which is as old as the existence of com - mon carriers, to-wit, that rates must be reasonable." Iln this case of State vs. F. E. &amp; M. V. R. R. Co., 22 Neb. 313, an act he legislature of Nebraska was under consideration, which provided t a railway commission, called the Board of Transportation, "shall e the general supervision of all railroads operated by steam in state and shall inquire into any neglect of duty or violation of any the laws of this state by railroad corporations." It was given rer to investigate complaints covering any unjust discrimination :her in rates, facilities furnished, or otherwise." The Supreme irt of Nebraska, in construing this statute, held: t"In the case under consideration, the Board found that the rates charges of respondent were excessive; in other words, that there unjust discrimination against that part of the state, and having so id the Board is clothed with ample power to require such railway pany to reduce its rates and charges. The power of the Board, efore, to establish and regulate rates and charges upon railways iln the state of Nebraska is full, ample and complete." The evident purpose of this amendment to the Nebraska constitu - tion was to give to the Commission thereby authorized such general control over railroads within the state of Nebraska as the legislature should prescribe. The mischief which this amendment obviously was in - tended to remedy was the power of carriers to impose such rates as they saw fit, as well as to stop illegal discriminations between patrons. The acts sought to be enjoined by the complainant in this case - are the hearing and determination of the Railway Commission upon the proposed schedule of rates, and also the giving of notice of their action after such determination. The defendants contend that In such proceedings they are acting as a legislative body and that their delibera - tion and decision cannot properly be enjoined. If the legislature of Che state were considering such a proposed schedule of rates it would </seg>

In the above cited case of Interstate Commerce Commission v*. Cincinnati Ry. Co., 167 U.

S., 4S3, it was said of a statute of the state of Kentucky, defining the powers of the Railway Commissioners of that state: "The fixing of fates is essentially legislative in its character, and the general rule is that legislative action cannot be Interfered with by injunction." I In the case of Alpers vs. San Francisco, 32 Fed"., 503, an injunc - was sought to restrain the passage of an ordinance. Mr. Justice , in rendering the opinion of the Court, said: "The difficulty presented In the case before us is that the applica - tion to enjoin the passage of any resolution, order, or ordinance, which ■»»y tend to impair the obligation of the contract, is an application to enjoin a legislative body from the exercise of legislative power, and to enjoin the exercise of such power is not within the jurisdiction of a court of equity. This no one will question, as applied to the power of the legislature of the state. The suggestion of any such jurisdiction of the court over that body would not be entertained for a moment. The same exemption from judicial interference applies to all legislative bodies, so far as their legislative discration extends. Municipal corpo - rations are instrumentalities of the state for the more convenient administration of local affairs, and for that purpose are invested with certain legislative power. In the exercise of that power, upon the subjects submitted to their jurisdiction, they are as much beyond judicial interference as the legislature of the state. The courts cannot In the one case forbid the passage of a law nor In the other the passage of a resolution, order or ordinance. If by either body, the legislature or the board of supervisors, an unconstitutional act be passed. Its enforcement may be arrested. The parties seeking to execute the invalid act can be reached by the courts, while the legislative body of the state, or of the municipality, in the exercise of its legislative discretion, is beyond their jurisdiction. The fact that in either case the legislative action threatened may be In disregard of constitutional re - straints, and impair the obligation of a contract, as in this case sJieged, does not affect the question. It is legislative discretion which is exercised, and that discretion, whether rightfully or wrongfully exercised, is not subject to interference by the judiciary." </seg>

The common council of Milwaukee, like other legis - ) bodies and courts is liable to commit errors which may be fatal its action; but that does not take away its power to act. Counsel the defendant admitted upon argument that the common council had rer to pass the ordinance, if it had proceeded regularly. But a court equity has no power to prevent such action merely because the mode manner of its procedure is Irregular. To do so would be to stop machinery of the city government. It is not a question of the priety, or expediency, or wisdom of the proposed action, but a ques - i of the power of the common council and the jurisdiction of the In the case of New Orleans Water WorkB vs. New Orleans, 164 U. 8. 471, It was said: "A court of equity cannot properly interfere with, or In advance restrain, the discretion of a municipal body while it is In the exercise of powers that are legislative in their character. It ought not to attempt to do indirectly what it could not do directly. In view of the adjudged cases, it cannot be doubted that the legislature may delegate to municipal assemblies the power of enacting ordinances that relate to local matters, and that such ordinances, if legally enacted, have the force of laws passed by the legislature of the &amp;tat? and are to be respected by all. But the courts will pass the line that separates Judicial from legislative authority if by any order or in any mode they assume to control the discretion with which municipal assemblies are invested, when deliberating upon the adoption or rejection of ordinances proposed for their adoption. The passage of ordinances by such bodi s are legislative acts which a court of equity will not enjoin. (Chicago vs. Evans, 24 Illinois 52. 57; Des Moines Gas Co. vs. Des Moines. Iowa, 44 Iowa 506; 1 Dillon on Mun. Corp. Sec. 308. and notes; 2 High on Injunctions Sec. 1246.) If an ordinance be pawed and is invalid, the jurisdiction of the courts may then be invoked for the protection of private rights that may be violated by its enforcement." To the same effect are Des Moines Gas Co. vs. Des Moines, 44 Iowa 505; Murphy vs. East Portland, 42 Fed. 310; Lewis vs. Denver, 19 fcolo., 236-34, Pac. 993; Rico vs. Snider, 134 Fed. 953. An exception to this rule exists when the municipal legislative body has no power to act on the particular subject. tin this case the power of the Railway Commission to fix and late rates is plainly given by the constitutional amendment and acts of the legislature above referred to. An injunction may not be granted to restrain the publication of the rates which the mission may adopt after a hearing. As said by the Supreme Court le United States, in a similar case: "As yet the Commissioners have done nothing. There is, certainly, much they may do in regulating charges within the state, which will not be in conflict with the constitution of the United States. It is to be presumed that they will always act within the limits of their constitu- </seg>

I For these reasons the temporary injunction asked must be dented the restraining order heretofore issued dissolved, and the defend - demurrer to the complainant's bill must be sustained. Memorandum Opinion of Unttf d States Circuit Court, Denying Ap - plication of C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co. for an Injunction Restraining the Nebraska State Railway Commission from Further Reducing Freight Rates on Grain, Pending Appeal. T. C. MUNGER, D. J. In this case the complainant has elected not to plead further, and a judgment of dismissal of its bill therefore follows. The complainant requests that during the pendency of an appeal which it wishes to prosecute, this Court will restore and continue In force the restraining order heretofore entered in this case. tThe restraining order requested enjoins the defendants, who are Railway Commissioners of the state of Nebraska, from mailing to complainant "any copies or copy of any order reducing the rates the transportation of corn, wheat and ftaxseed, and from in any ner giving any notice to the said Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy road Company of any order of said board reducing the rates for the sportation of corn, wheat, and flaxseed in the state of Nebraska ged and maintained by the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad ipany." I The power undoubtedly exists in the Court to continue an Injunc - in force in proper cases, during the pendency of an appeal, under y rule No. 93. (Cottlng vs. Kansas City Stock Yards Company, ed. 839-857.) I In this case the complainant's bill alleged that the defendant lway Commissioners had served notice on the complainant that ertain schedule of rates set out in the complainant's bill would adopted at a hearing on a certain date "with such changes and lifications as may be deemed necessary, unless good and sufficient se is shown why they should not be." I The complainant now asks for an order of injunction pending eal. restraining the defendant Railway Commissioners not only n putting into force the proposed schedule set out in the bill of iplainant but also from putting into force 'any other reduction of *. The result of such an order would be that the Railway Com - sioners could not enforce any order which they might make on consideration, however reasonable, fair and just such reduction ht be. The granting of an injunction against any other action t the defendants might possibly take in the future and during the dency of this appeal, in an action where the bill complains of a nite proposed schedule, would be beyond the ordinary scope of </seg>
            <seg id="p305">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 305 relief granted in such cases. On the oral argument on this hearing the ittorney for the complainant asserted that a restraining order directed merely against the giving of notice under the schedule proposed by the Railway Commissioners was not sought by the complainant at this time. The Injunction was denied in this case, on the theory that the relief sought was the restraining of a legislative act within the power of the Railway Commissioners of Nebraska. In the case of Cottlng vs. Kansas City Stock Yards Company, cited above, an injunction was asked for against the enforcement of an act of the legislature. tit is not necessary now to decide what right the complainant would i in this case were it seeking to restrain the enforcement of an r that had been made by the Board of Railway Commissioners of state. Until an order has been made by the Railway Commissioners e is no question properly presented to the Court relating to its en - ?ment, and as in this case defendants have not yet made an order it Id be premature to restrain the enforcement of an order which might after be made. If the Railway Commissioners had made an order and an injunc - tion seeking to restrain its enforcement was denied, th?n a bond might properly be required to protect those who would be wronged if the order was legal and valid, as in the case of Cotting vs. Kansas City Stock Yards Company, above cited; whereas a bond could not now be given which would protect those who might be wronged If the board should make a valid order, because until the board has acted It cannot be determined what the order would be and therefore It cannot be determined what loss, if any, might be suffered by shippers of the articles referred to. In this way the complainant would enjoy immunity from the enforcement of an order which might after - wards be determined to be valid and there would, be no redress possible to the shippers. This is one of the most obvious reasons why in advance of ths legislative action of the Board of Railwiy Commis - sioners the restraining order should not be issued. Obviously the Court should not act until such time as protection coul ! be afforded to those whose interests are involved in the litigation. For these reasons the application of the complainant for a re - straining order during the pendency of the appeal is denied. ■ I am authorized to state that Judge W. H.

            <seg id="p306">306 FIRST ANNUAL REPORT Carland, District Judge, deliverfed the opinion of the Court The record in this case discloses that on or about the 17th day of August, 1907, appellees acting as the Nebraska State Railway Commission issued a notice to appellant that on the 9th day of Sep - tember, 1907, at ten o'clock A. M., said Railway Commission would consider the question of fixing the rates on grain and grain products in straight carloads, transported between points in Nebraska and that the rates contained in a schedule attached to said notice would be adopted with such changes and modifications as should be deemed necessary unless good and sufficient Cdune should be shown why they should not be. The only good and sufficient cause shown by appel - lant pursuant to the invitation contained in said notice was the filing of the bill in this case on the 10th day of September, 1907, while ■mid Railway Commission was engaged in considering the matter mentioned in said notice and before said Commission had reached any conclusion therein. Upon the filing of &amp;aid bill, appellant obtained an order fixing the 23rd day of September, 1907, as the time when the Court would hear an application for a temporary injunction, and also In the meantime restraining appellees as members of the Nebraska State Railway Commission from mailing to appellant any copies or copy of any order reducing the rates for the transportation of corn, wheat and ftaxseed and from in any manner giving any notice to appel - lant of any order of said board reducing the rates for the transpor - tation of corn, wheat and fiaxseed in the state of Nebraska, charged and maintained by appellant. At the time appointed for the hearing of the motion for a temporary injunction appellees appeared and filed a demurrer to the bill. In addition to the general ground of want of equity, said demurrer specified the following grounds: I "3. It appears on the face of said bill that the schedule of rates the transportation by railroads within the state of Nebraska of the modities of corn and wheat mentioned and complained of therein not been fixed, determined on or adopted by defendants and the lequences alleged by said bill to be threatened are not cognizable in Ity prior to the adoption of such rates by the Nebraska State Iway Commission. I "4. The functions of the Nebraska State Railway Commission to and determine upon reasonable rates for transportation of imodities by railroads within said state are legislative, and are •gated to it pursuant to an amendment of the constitution of said e. duly adopted, and the powers of defendants in that behalf as nbers of said Commission are co-ordinate and independent of the Iciary and not subject to control or restraint by a court of equity till &gt;r its acts have been duly passed ard finally adopted; and so upon face of complainant's bill showing no final action has been had by ?ndants touching the adoption of the schedule of rates complained this Court has no jurisdiction to hear and determine this action. "5. It appears on the face of said bill that the fixing of schedules of rates for transportation of corn and wheat, the acts complained of, are not threatened to be done in any event till after complainants ■ball have been given a hearing and opportunity to show cause why the same should not be adopted, and that complainant had an adequate remedy at law." </seg>
            <seg id="p307">NEBRASKA STATIC UAILWAY COMMISSION 307 Upon said hearing the Court sustained said demurrer, refused to grant a temporary Injunction as prayed, and dissolved the restrain - ing order theretofore granted. Appellants declining to plead further, final decree dismissing the bill was entered and appellant has appealed therefrom to this Court. The circuit court refused to continue the restraining order pending the appeal and the record does not show what the Railway Commission has done as to the matters referred to in the Dotice of August 17, 1907. It was stated, however, at the Argument in this Court by counsel for the appellees that the Railway Commission had never as yet concluded its consideration of said mat - ters. In view of this condition of the record, we turn to the allega - tions of the bill with some interest. The demurrer admits all the facts alleged therein that are well pleaded. It does not admit conclusions of law or mere matters of opinion not justified by the facts. The follow - ing material facts appear in the bill: Appellant is a citizen of Illinois. Defendants are citizens of Nebraska, and constitute the Nebraska State Railway Commission. The requisite amount in controversy to give jurisdiction. Appellant is the owner and engaged in the operation of * system of railways extending through the states of Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, Colorado, Wyoming and Montana. On the 17th day of August, 1907, said Railway Commission served a notice upon appellant in words and figures as follows: "Lincoln, Nebraska, August 17, 1907. I "Notice is hereby given the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad npany that at 10 o'clock a. m., September 9, 1907, the Nebraska te Railway Commission will consider the question of fixing the rates grain and grain products in straight carloads, transported between its within this state, and the rates hereto attached will be ad h such changes and modifications as may b&gt; deemed necessary, ess good and sufficient cause is shown why they should not be. "NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION. "H. J. WINNETT, Chairman. Attest: CLARK PERKINS, Secretary »Tbe rates now in force on appellant's lines in Nebraska were blished by the legislature of said state by an act approved April 907. Said act is as follows: "Sec. 1. (Maximum Freight Rates.) It shall be unlawful for any railway company or common carrier, operating or doing busin ss In the state of Nebraska, to charge, collect or receive for the transporta - tion of live stock, potatoes, grain and grain products, fruit, coal, lumber, or building material in carload lots, within the Btate of Nebraska, more than eighty-five per cent (85%) of the amount fixed in the classifica - tion and schedules of such railway companies or common carriers for the transportation of euch property in force and effect on their various lines of railway on the first day of January, 1907, until after the State Railway Commission shall have provided a greater rate upon any article or property in such schedules from the rat? herein fixed. "Sec. 2. (Reasonableness of Rate; Hearing.) The State Rail - way Commission shall have the power to hear and determine whether or not the freight rate upon any article or articles in such schedule or classification of rates Is either so high as to be unjust to shippers, or so low as to be unremunerative or unjust to any common carrier </seg>
            <seg id="p308">308 FIRST ANNUAL, REPORT affected thereby and upon complaint in writing, of any person or corpo - ration affected thereby, particularly specifying the article or articles upon which such rates are either too high or too low and the facts in connection therewith, said Railway Commission shall set such cause for hearing and upon a trial thereon and a full hearing after notice thereof, shall either raise or lower the rate therein fixed upon such article or articles to the end that the same shall be just and reasonable to all parties concerned." The bill further alleges that the rates fixed by said act are unjust, unreasonable and confiscatory. That the rates between points in Nebraska for the transportation of corn, wheat and flaxseed, as stated in the schedules attached to the notice served on appellant on or about August 17, 1907, are very much lower than .the rates on said commodities fixed by the legislature in said act of April 8, 1907. That the rates stated in said schedule attached to said notice are confiscatory, unjust and unreasonable and will directly interfere with interstate commerce if established and enforced. That no complaint by any person or corporation affected by the rates named in said act of April 8, 1907, has been filed with or presented to the said defend - ants or either of them or the Nebraska State Railway Commission. The bill then proceeds as follows: "Your orator further avers that notwithstanding the facts aforesaid, the said defendants constituting the said Nebraska State Railway Commission threaten and intend, and unless restrained by the order of this Honorable Court,, in// attempt t&lt;&gt; establish, at,d establish, as the rates for the transportation of said grain within the state of Nebraska, the rates named and set forth in said schedules, and will require your orator to make, keep and publish the schedules showing the said rates and charges and will at once and without opportunity to be heard mail copies thereof to your orator and give notice thereof to your orator and will require your orator to transport said grain within the state of Nebraska at said rates, and will attempt to enforce its said orders, and will institute proceedings against your orator for any violation of said order, and will institute various proceedings against your orator for penalties for violation of said order, and will institute various proceedings against the officers and agents of your orator for violations of the said order, all of which will give rise to a great multiplicity of suits, and will constitute a continuous and serious interference with, and an interruption to the business of your orator and will be a continuing trespass upon the rights of your orator. "And your orator further avers that if the said defendants as members of the Nebraska State Railway Commission should make an order putting into effect the said schedule of rates or any schedule of rates for the transportation of said commodities lower than those now in force and should mail copies thereof to your orator, then under the laws of Nebraska, every person interested in said order, which would include all producers and shippers in grain, would have a right to institute proceedings against your orator to enforce the provisions thereof, and your orator avers that if such order is made and said copy mailed, very many of the persons interested in said order would institute separate proceedings in the various counties of this state against your orator; that many county attorneys throughout the state would, in their respective counties, institute criminal proceed - ings against your orator; that many private persons would file com- </seg>

The following is the prayer of the bill: "In consideration whereof, aDd for as much as your orator is remediless Id the premises by the strict rules of the common law, and can have relief only in a court of equity where matters of this kind are properly cognizable and relievable. your orator prays that the said defendants, and each of them as members of, and constituting the Nebraska State Railway Commission, be upon the filing of this bill temporarily restrained and enjoined from putting into effect, or at - tempting to put into effect. &lt;ttni /mm rtlnbtittting or attempting t&gt; ext •liiixli.

The powers and duties of such Commission shall include the regulation of rates, service and general control of common carriers as the legislature may provide by law. But in the absence of specific legislation the Commission shall exercise the powers and perform the duties enumer - ated in this provision." ■ We also quote the following from the act of the legislature of state of Nebraska, approved March 27, 1907: I'^ec. 2. (b.) Said Commission shall have the power to regulate rates and services of, and to exercise a general control over all oads, express companies, car companies, sleeping car companies, ht and freight line companies and all other common carriers ged in the transportation of freight or passengers within the I "Sec. 2. (d. ) Said Commission shall have the power, and it I be its duty to make all necessary classifications and to fix all ssary rates, charges and regulations to govern and regulate the rht and passenger tariffs of railway companies and common carriers, power to correct abuses and prevent unjust discriminations, extor - ) and overcharges in rates of freight and passenger tariffs on the rent railroads in this state, and to enforce the same by having penalties inflicted as hereinafter provided, through proper courts ng jurisdiction." I "Sec. 2. (e. ) Said Commission shall have the power, and it shall ts duty to fairly and justly classify and subdivide all freight and &gt;erty of whatsoever character and description that may be trans - ed over the railways of this state, into such general and special »es as may be found necessary and expedient, and to fix to each s or subdivision of freight, a reasonable rate for each railway pany or common carrier, for the transportation of each of said »es and subdivisions; the classifications herein provided for shall y to and be the same for all railway companies or common carriers ect to the provisions of this act." As all rightful legislative power except as its exercise may be limited by the federal or state constitutions is possessed by the legis - lature of Nebraska, it is incorrect to speak of the constitution of Nebraska as a grant of power so far as the legislature is concerned. The legislature would have full power to delegate to the Nebraska State Railway Commission the authority to fix rates for the transporta - tion of passengers and freight by common carriers within the state of Nebraska if the constitution were silent upon that subject. It seems clear, therefore, that the power to act in the matter in controversy, so fax as the laws of Nebraska are concerned, has been fully conferred. That the general power to fix rates for the transportation of passengers and freight by common carriers between points within a state belongs to the legislature of each state; that said power may be exercised by the legislature itself or be delegated by it to a commission established for that purpose; that courts of equity will not interfere by injunction to control the exercise of this power In advance are propositions established beyond question by the following authorities: </seg>

It must be conceded, we think, that the Nebraska State Railway Commission cannot interfere with the power of congress to regulate Interstate commerce nor confiscate the property of appellant by the mere consideration of the question mentioned in the notice of August 17, 1907, but even if it could, the judiciary cannot control its actions in advance. The great political truth that "the accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, a few or many, and whether hereditary, self appointed, or elective, may be Justly pronounced the very definition of tyranny," has always been recognized by those who have struggled for liberty in the years that are gone and it has always formed one of the great basic principles upon which the national and state governments have been founded. The national constitution and those of all the states have provided that the powers of government shall be vested In three departments, the executive, the legislative and the judicial. The fact that the appellant might be subjected to a multiplicity of suits, or that it might suffer Irreparable damage, when compared with the necessity of maintaining in all its integrity the proposition that the Judiciary will not seek to control legislative action in advance, is dwarfed Into insignificance. I "The legislative and judicial are co-ordinate departments of the ernment of equal dignity; each is alike supreme in the exercise ts proper functions, and cannot directly or indirectly, while acting bin the limits of its authority, be subjected to the control or super - on of the other without an unwarrantable assumption by that other power which by the constitution is not conferred upon it. The stitutlon apportions the powers of government but it does not Ice any one of the three departments subordinate to another when rcising the trust committed to it. The courts may declare legis - ▼e enactment* unconstitutional and void in some cases, but not ause the judicial power is superior in degree or dignity to the Islatlve." — Cooley's Constitutional Limitations, 192. it is an unwarrantable assumption for the judiciary of the e sovereignty to directly or indirectly control or supervise the </seg>
            <seg id="p312">312 Ilative power, what can be said of the attempt of the judiciary different jurisdiction to control or supervise the legislative power 1 the orders of said judiciary, even when acting within its tubted jurisdiction, are received with hostile resentment? It is ned. however, that conceding that the fixing of rates as proposed he State Railway Commission is an act of legislation and that a t of equity will not seek to control the action of said Commission ■ to the actual fixing of the rate, still the bill in this case may be itaintd for the purpose of perpetually enjoining said Commission i giving any notice to appellant of any rates that they may fix. claim arises from the fact that section 5 of the act of the Ne - ka legislature approved March 27, 1907, provides as follows: "The said Railway Commission shall fix as soon as practicable thereafter a schedule and classification of rates and charges, except Joint rates hereinafter provided for, for the transportation of freights. passengers, and cars, over the various lines of railroad in this state, and to that end the said Commission shall give the railroad company or common carriers to be affected thereby ten days notice of the time and place when and where the rates will be fixed, and any such railroad company or common carrier shall be entitled to be heard at such time and place to the end that justice may be done; and shall have process to t-nforce the attendance of witnesses to be served as in civil cases. Said schedule of rates and charges so fixed and prescribed, shall go into effect not less than thirty days nor more than sixty days, within the discretion of the Commission, after the same have been completed and copies thereof mailed to the railway companies and common carriers affected thereby, and any or all rates therein contained shall be and remain in force and effect from and after said time unless modified, annulled or otherwise revised, either in whole or in part, by the said Railway Commission upon a hearing with respect thereto before said Commission, or until such rate or rates are finally adjudged to be unreasonable and unjust in a court of competent jurisdiction." I It is argued that if the Railway Commission are permitted to fix rate and to fix the time within the limits of the law when the same 1 go into effect, and shall mail copies of the schedule or schedules ates so fixed, that appellant would be without remedy in a federal t of equity for the reason that the law fixes the time when the s shall go into effect and that after notice has been mailed there Id be nothing to enjoin, as the court has no power to restrain the ling of time. We will first consider the objections that stand in way of granting such relief on the present bill and then consider ther or not appellant would have a remedy in a federal court of ity after notice of the fixing of the rate had been mailed to it. The first objection against granting the relief claimed is that prior to the fixing of the rate this Court is bound by a conclusive presumption that the Railway Commission will act justly, fairly and within the limits of its power. The second objection to the issue of a perpetual injunction against giving a notice of the fixing of a rate is, that courts only concern them - selves with real controversies. It certainly cannot be the law that the different railroads in a particular state, after a Commission has been </seg>
            <seg id="p313">313 empowered to fix rates, may file a bill in equity in the United States circuit court for the proper district and obtain an injunction restraining the Commission from putting into effect any schedule of rates which it may thereafter adopt. Take the present case, for Illustration, upon what evidence would a decree rest perpetually enjoining the Railway Commission of giving notice to appellant of any rates it may hereafter fix? The answer is plain. The decree could rest only upon proof that the rates, notice of which is to be restrained, were void for some valid reason, and as the rates are not yet fixed and the Court has no authority to interfere in advance with the fixing thereof, it results that inherently and funda - mentally the bill must fail to support the relief now under discussion. But counsel for appellant take a much too narrow view of the powers of a federal court of equity. Those courts are not limited in their powers to the mere restraint of threatened injury, but may, in proper cases, where the necessity exists, compel action by mandatory in- In the case of in re Lennon, 166 D. S. 556, it is said: "But it was clearly not beyond the power of a court o? equity. which is not always limited to the restraint of a contemplated or threatened action, but may even require affirmative action where the circumstances of the case demand it. (Robinson vs. Lord Byron. 1 Bro. C. C. 588; Hervey vs. Smith, 1 Kay &amp; Johns 389; Beadel vs. Perry, L. R. 3 Eq. 465; Whitecar vs. Michenor, 37 N. J. Eq.6; Brome vs. New York &amp; New Jersey Telephone Co., 42 N. J. Eq. 141.)" In this very case, if the Railway Commission should proceed and fix a rate which would be unlawful in view of constitutional limita - tions,, and give notice thereof to appellant, there would be thirty days at least before the rates would go into effect in which appellant could file * bill in equity in the United States circuit court, and upon a proper showing obtain a temporary injunction, mandatory in character, compelling the Railway Commission to withdraw and cancel the notice already given until the further order of the court, and if appellant should maintain its bill upon the merits, it would be entitled to a perpetual injunction, either mandatory or otherwise, preventing the enforcement of the rates so established. Not only is this true, but even after a schedule of rates has gone into effect, appellant, its stockholders, its mortgage bondholders or any other person or cor - poration having the proper interest may file a bill in equity to enjoin the enforcement of rates, and the court which first acquires jurisdiction over the matter will hold it to the exclusion of all other courts or officers until the case is finally determined. (In the matter of Edward T. Young, petitioner, opinion by Supreme Court of the United States filed March 23, 1908; Thomas F. Hunter, Sheriff, etc., vs. James H. Wood, opinion by the Supreme Court of the United States, filed March 23, 1908.) It results from the foregoing that the bill was prematurely filed and the decree of the circuit court must be affirmed.

I EPPERSON, C. In their petition relators allege, among other ss, that the respondent is a corporation and a common carrier; that the duty of respondent, purusuant to section 5, Art. 8, Ch. 72, Comp. L907, to file with relators within 30 days after the 27th day of :h, 1907, all freight schedules, classifications, rates, tariffs, and ges used by respondent, and in effect January 1, 1907, and that undent refuses so to do, though often requested by relators. Re - 's pray for a writ of mandamus requiring respondent forthwith lie such schedule with relators as the Nebraska State Railway mission. Respondent answered, setting forth at length the nature s business; admitted that it was a corporation, but denied that it a common carrier. The following facts are either admitted by the pleadings or estab - lished by the evidence: The respondent is a corporation duly organized and existing under and by virtue of the laws of the state of Nebraska, and among other provisions of its articles of incorporation is the fol - lowing: "The general nature of the business to be transacted by Mid corporation shall be the purchase and sale, the feeding and caring for, slaughtering, dressing, packing and holding for sale, selling, and selling for others, of live stock, including cattle, hogs, sheep, and horses, and shipping by refrigerator cars or otherwise of meats and products thereof, and doing generally the business of a stock yard, and whatever is Incident or any wise related to or usually connected therewith. And in furtherance of the said business of the said company to guarantee the obligations of other corporations and of other parties and to apply Its funds to the purchase and payment of stocks and bonds or either stocks or bonds of other corporations. It shall be competent for said corporation to construct, maintain, and operate a railroad, with tracks of other railroad companies, which shall be operated for the purposes of its business as above set forth, as well, also, of carrying passengers and freight for the general public. The termini of said road shall be the city of Omaha in county of Douglas, and a point on the south line of said county not further west of the Missouri river than fifteen miles, and the amount of capital stock necessary to construct such road is ($300,000) three hundred thousand dollars." Respondent, however, has never been en - gaged in the packing house business, or shipping any commodities of its own production, nor has it ever been engaged in passenger traffic. It owns a large tract of land In South Omaha upon which it has constructed E dings, sheds, and pens for receiving and caring for live stock, has upon Its premises about 36 miles of railroad tracks. There located on the margin of respondent's premises five slaughtering packing houses owned by different corporations where live stock </seg>
            <seg id="p315">315 is slaughtered and the products packed for shipment. There are also located on its premises a lumber company, a grain elevator, and a cooperage company's plant, and other industries. Respondent has railroad tracks upon its premises leading to said sheds and pens and to the said several industries located on its tracks, and these tracks connect with a transfer track, which connects with the tracks of several railroad companies engaged in interstate and state traffic. Cars loaded with live stock and other freight are transferred into respondent's premises, and to the pens, sheds and buildings thereon, and to the several industries by means of said transfer track and the other tracks upon respondent'! premises. Cars going into respondent's premises are placed by the rail - road company desiring them carried in on the transfer track, this track being located on respondent's premises. And respondent there receives the cars, and takes them by means of its locomotives and engines to the point of destination in respondent's premises. Cars destined out of re - spondent's premises are carried by it over its tracks by means of its said locomotives to the transfer track, where the railroad company over whose lines they are to be carried receives them and hauls them away. Empty cars are delivered by the several railroad companies upon the transfer track, and these are haul d by respondent in this manner either to the pens, sheds, buildings or industries on respondent's premises, as directed by the company setting the cars on the transfer track. Respond - ent owns 3 flat cars used only upon its own premises for picking up refuse in and about the yards and for hauling cinders from the packing plants into respondent's premises. It owns 11 engines which it uses in its business. It has constructed no railroad tracks except those upon its own premises other than one track across the streets, authority for which was given by ordinance. Respondent has no station on Its premises other than where live stock is unloaded and loaded into can and at the industries mentioned above. At all these stations, and at the industries, the freight is received into cars owned by the railroad companies. Live stock received into or going out of the yards is unloaded and loaded by respondent, and freight received or shipped from the industries is unloaded or loaded by the plants. Respondent has never exercised the power of eminent domain. Respondent, in the manner aforesaid, handles all cars requested by the common car - riers to be handled by it where the tracks of the requesting common carrier reaches the transfer track, for which service respondent receives compensation from the railroad companies as provided in a circular of charges based upon a written contract between respondent and some of the railroad companies. The same charges are made other companies not signing the contract. Respondent has no tracks for unloading and loading freight from wagons into cars or from cars into wagons, or any place for the general public to receive or load freight for shipment. Where the owner of live stock in the yards desires to ship same oat of the yards, respondent procures the necessary cars from the railroad company over whose lines the stock is to be shipped, Joads them, and </seg>
            <seg id="p316">316 FIRST ANNUAL REPORT delivers the same to the railroad company upon the transfer track. The manner of receiving live stock destined to points in the yards is for the railroad company to deliver to respondent a waybill and to set cars upon the transfer track. This waybill shows the point of origin of the shipment and point of destination. Respondent takes the cars into its premises and unloads them to the consignee. Respondent collects all of the freight charges due to railroad companies on incoming live stock when not prepaid, and pays the same over weekly to the railroad companies, but collects no freight charges on outgoing freight nor on incoming dead freight. When requested, respondent transfers cars from one railroad company to another. The railroad companies are not authorized to issue any bill of lading for respondent for any shipment Incoming or outgoing from its premises, nor does respondent issue any bills of lading on its own behalf, or on behalf of any railroad company connected with its tracks, nor does it fix rates for the con - necting companies. Live stock consigned to points inside of the yards is generally consigned to a commission agent to whom it is delivered by respondent. The live stock agent sells the shipment for the owner, and if the freight charges have not been prepaid, the com - mission man pays the charges to respondent, who pays it over weekly to the railroad companies. Respondent does not receive any freight from the railroad companies except cars loaded with freight or empty cars. The average daily receipts during the year are about 625 cars received in, which would make a movement of 1,250 cars in and out daily. There are 152 chutes on respondent's premises where live stock is loaded and unloaded. Respondent has never filed any plat of the route of the track that has been built on its premises nor of any intended to be built, and has never made a report to the Secretary of State in con - formity to section 1, Art. 11, of the constitution, nor as required by section 88, Ch. 16, Comp. St. 1907. Respondent's property is assessed by the local assessor for taxation, and is not assessed by the state board of equalization. It might be further said that respondent also hauls cars from one industry to another in their interchange of business, and receives compensation therefor from the industry re - ceiving the service. A fee is paid by the railroad companies for re - spondent's services in taking loaded cars to and from the Industries and from the transfer tracks and stock yards, the amount being the same (|1.00 per car) and does not depend upon the distance hauled nor the amount of freight contained in the cars. From time to time the re - spondent changed articles of incorporation, and on one occasion by a res - olution duly made and passed, the proper officers were directed to certify adoption of an amendment according to the requirements of the general railroad laws of this state, thereby indicating its intention at that time to operate under our railroad laws. Respondent has never, however, taken advantage of its charter right to operate a rail - road devoted to general freight and passenger traffic and its tracks have not been extended beyond the limits of its own property. </seg>
            <seg id="p317">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 317 Summarizing this statement of facts, we find the following, which we consider control this case: Respondent is authorized by its charter to construct and operate a railroad for the purpose of carrying freight to the general public. It iias constructed railroad tracks connecting with the tracks of other carriers and connecting also with a large num - ber of industries whose plants are established upon the margin of re - spondent's property. It is engaged in the carrying of freight which the public consigns in carload lots, or which the connecting carrier assembles in carload lots to the several industries upon its tracks, and to the commission men who receive consignments of live stock in the yards of the respondent. It carries like shipments for the shippers of live stock from its yards, and also from the industries located upon the margin of its land, and delivers the same to the several connecting car - riers. It transports freight from one of the aforesaid industries to an - other. It is not engaged in the production of commodities. Its vocation is purely one of service to others. With the exception of feeding live stock in transit, the service rendered is the carrying of freight. For the service thus rendered it receives a compensation. I At the general election in 1906, there was adopted an amendment our constitution which is as follows: "There shall be a State lway Commission, consisting of three members, who shall be first :ted at the general election in 1906, whose term of office ex - t those chosen at the first election under this provision, shall be years, and whose compensation shall be fixed by the legislature. Of three Commissioners first elected, the one receiving the highest num - of votes shall hold his office for six years, the next highest four rs, and the lowest two years. The powers and duties of such omission shall include the regulation of rates, service and general trol of common carriers as the legislature may provide by law. : in the absence of specific legislation the Commission shall exercise powers and perform the duties enumerated in this provision." By an act of the legislature, appearing as chapter 90, page 311, of the laws of 1907, the legislature prescribed the powers, duties, and qualifications of the State Railway Commission. Section 4 is in part as follows: "The term common carriers as used herein shall be taken to include all corporations, companies, individuals and associations of individuals, their lessees, or receivers (appointed by any court whatsoever) that may dow or hereafter own, operate, manage or control any railroad, interurban or street railway line operated either by steam or electricity or any other motive power, or part thereof, or any express company, car company, sleeping car company, freight and freight line company, telegraph and telephone companies and any other carrier engaged in the transmission of messages or tran sportation of passengers or freight for hire." tThe question presented for determination, stated generally, is this: e respondent a common carrier within the meaning of the consti - nal amendment and the act of the legislature of 1907? Re- </seg>
            <seg id="p318">318 FIRST ANNUAL REPORT apondent contends that it is not a common carrier within the common - law definition of that term, that the common carriers of the constitu - tional amendment are such carriers only as would be declared common carriers by the common law, and that the definition prescribed by the legislature is an unwarranted expansion of the meaning of the term. At the threshold of this case, therefore, we are met with the inquiry, is the definition of "common carrier" in the act of the legis - lature an enlargement of the meaning of those words which will prohibit the application of the act to a class of agencies not strictly within the common law classification of common carriers? t There are but two carriers known in law — private carriers and non carriers. A private carrier undertakes to deliver particular 8 at a particular place. He is not bound in law to undertake transportation. When opportunity for such employment is ;nted, he may reject it or avail himself of it as he sees flt. He •s into a contract applicable to and binding him only as to the cular undertaking. He does not hold himself out to the public as a carrier. Strictly speaking, at common law, so far as its vocation Is concerned, a common carrier is one which holds itself out to the public as a carrier always open to employment for the transportation of persons or freight, and that it will carry for all persons indiscrim - inately. A common carrier undertakes to convey freight from one place to another, and it makes no difference whether the distance be long or short. It is not necessary to make of itself a common carrier that it should hold itself out as ready to transport freight from any place to any other place; but the transportation may be confined from one point upon the line it operates to another point upon its line, or upon the line of a connecting carrier. By the present general adoption and use of the term "common carrier" it is not necessarily limited to one 'which holds itself out to carry any and all kinds of freight, but it applies with equal force to any company whose vocation is of a public nature, although limited to the transportation of certain classes or kinds of freight, and it may be of service to a limited few who by their peculiar situation or business, may have occasion to employ It. With the development of commerce and increased facilities for the transportation of passengers, freight, and intelligence the meaning of the words "common carrier" has correspondingly changed, not alone by technical and arbitrary legislative enactments, but by reasonable, necessary and general adoption, so that now it means not only the stage coach and canal boat, but railway, street railway, and express companies — yes, telegraph and telephone companies. It appears that. In addition to operating the tracks within the boundaries of its own private property, the respondent receives from connecting railway companies, and delivers to the various packing plants and industries adjacent to its property freight cars for the transportation of live stock and merchandise. It accepts from connecting carriers loaded or empty can, and delivers the same to the several industries or to the consignee </seg>
            <seg id="p319">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 319 of live stock or to the shipper of live stock from its yards irrespective of persons, and for these purposes it must be considered as forming a component part of the system of railway transportation carried on by the connecting lines, and to this extent it is equally subject to the duties and obligations of a common carrier. We think there can be no doubt but that the respondent can be required to extend equal privileges to any person who may establish an industry for the produc - tion of commodities for shipment upon the margin of its grounds, that it could be compelled, if necessary to furnish to any person who might desire to ship live stock under like conditions the same facilities as It now furnishes to its present patrons. We think there can be no doubt but that a railroad company, building -its tracks to the transfer line of the respondent, could demand and receive the same facilities for the delivery of live stock to commission men of South Omaha and to the several industries adjacent to respondent's property as is now given to the present connecting railroads. As to such person the respondent must be considered a common carrier, even though it transacts only a small part of the business transacted by such common carriers as are doing a general business; or, in other words, it is a common carrier in the special line to which it has devoted its energies, although not a common carrier for all purposes. Respondent does not produce commodities. Its business is strictly one of service to others. Its scope is one of magnitude, handling, as the evidence shows, 1,260 cars per day, or 456,250 during the year. Its vocation is the transportation of freight over its own lines. It holds itself out to the public as ready and willing to transport all freight for those who have occasion to employ it for the purpose for which it exists, and receives compensation therefor. The statute, we think, has reference to all companies or persons who hold themselv s out to the public as engaged in those things which characterize it as a common carrier. It has been said that a common carrier is one who holds itself "out as ready to carry at reasonable rates such com - modities as are in his line of business for all persons who offer them, as nearly as his means will allow." (Faucher vs. Wilson, 68 X. H. 338, 38 Atl. 1002, 39 L. R. A. 431, and cases cited.) In the case at bar, respondent holds itself out as a carrier of certain classes of freight, namely: Such as is tendered it in carload lots. That is its line of business. It is a common carrier within the meaning of section 4, Ch. 90, page 320, Sess. Laws 1907, of the constitutional amendment. In Missouri P. R. Co. vs. Wichita Wholesale Grocery Co., 55 E. 625, 40 Pac. 899, it was held: "A railroad company taking ed cars from its connection with another railroad, and transferring i by means of a switch engine, over a portion of its own track. Pi spur of its own, and receiving its compensation from the connecting i, acts as a common carrier, and is liable as such for the safety of goods transported, no matter how short the distance from the place receipt to that of delivery." In opinion we find the following: </seg>
            <seg id="p320">320 I railway corporations are by statute made common carriers, and Ired to transport persons and property, as such, for all persons s. Gen. St. 1889, Par. 1212. The distance over which freight auled, whether in carload lots or in less quantities, whether in iwn cars or those belonging to connecting carriers, can make no rence with the capacity in which the company acts. A . .iHroad sporting a passenger or a carload of freight one mile, using a ?h engine for motive power, is just as much a common carrier as e distance were a thousand miles by regular freight or passenger i." See also, opinion in U. S. vs. Union Stock Yards Company, 158 — (T. C. Munger, J.) The bulk of respondent's business comes from the railroads run - ning into South Omaha. These railroad companies are not producers of the goods, wares, merchandise, and live stock delivered to ro°pondent for transportation or delivery. Such freight consists of commodities consigned by the public to the industries upon the respondent's tracks, or to commission men, receiving live stock at the respondent's yards. Though the respondent receives such employment frt «• the railroad companies and looks to them for its compensation, yet its service is to the public, to the same extent as were the services rendered by the connecting railroads in their transportation of the same freight. It holds itself out as ready and willing to transport such freight to the several industries and to the stock yards for all railroads entering South Omaha. Its employment is not limited to a certain few, but ex - tends to all railroads. It is continually at work, daily transacting bus - iness of importance to the commercial world. It is the center of a vast transportation or commercial business, to complete which its duties as a carrier are constantly invoked. Respondent admits that it is subject In legislative control and that its rates may be regulated by statutt. We think that this is true, and that it is true because respondent is a common carrier. If it is not such, then it Is a private carrier, and the legislature would have nothing whatever to say about its rates. The statute above quoted clearly defines a common carrier, and, under its provisions, anyone engaged in the transportation of freight for hire is declared to be a common carrier. This, however, must be construed to mean any person whose public profession is the transportation of goods, and who is not at liberty to reject the carrying of such freight as he has held himself out to the world as willing to convey. With this construction of the statute we find that it is not an unwarranted enlargement of the common law meaning of "common carriers," as that meaning has grown to designate the improved agencies of commerce, according to Its general adoption and use, nor has the legislative provision exceeded the authority of the constitution in declaring what shall be considered common carriers. Respondent contends that it is but a switching company; that be - e its charges for services rendered are made as a switching fee, not based upon the rate or value of the freight, or upon the distance </seg>
            <seg id="p321">321 hauled, it cannot be classed as a common carrier. Kentucky and In - diana Bridge Co. vs. Louisville &amp; Nashville Ry. Co. (C. C.) 37 Fed. 567, 2 L. R. A. 289, is cited by respondent. It was there held: "Where a corporation which is under no legal obligation to do so voluntarily contracts to switch cars over its tracks between two or more railways, for which service it collscts a certain switching charge for switching the cars, loaded or empty, but charges no traffic rates on the freight transported, or transferred, in the cars, such corporation, in the performance of such service, assumes none of the responsibilities of a common carrier, but only those of a switchman. In respect to cars or traffic thus handled, such corporation can only be regarded as a switchman or transfer company; and it is no more a common carrier of interstate commerce or traffic, within the provisions of the law, than a city transfer company, which checks a passenger's baggage at the hotel where it is received, and carries it for an agreed compensation to the station of the railway over which it is to be transported into another state." That case is clearly distinguishable from the one at bar. It there appears that the charter of the bridge company made the bridge "a public thoroughfare or highway for the use of which by railroads or street cars, wagons, vehicles, animals, and foot passengers it was authorized to charge reasonable toll." It is said in the opinion: "The franchises and powers conferred upon petitioner of building, maintaining and operating its bridge and approaches, designated as its terminal facilities, do not, in and of themselves, constitute it a common carrier of property; on the contrary, they are appropriately confined to the erection and maintenance of a thoroughfare or public highway open to the use of others, common carriers and private parties upon making compensation therefor, in tha shape of 'reason - able tolls.' • • • The word, as used in its charter, is strictly applicable to charges for the use of its highway, rather than to compen - sation for transportation services to be performed by itself. The dis - tinction between such an incorporated bridge, or highway, established and maintained for use by common carriers and others, upon paying compensation for such use, in the way of 'tolls,' however graduated, and that of an incorporated common carrier engaged in transporting property for hire, is well defined. * • • The powers and franchises conferred upon petitioner find their legitimate scope and operation in the building, operating, and maintaining its bridge and approaches thereto, for the public purposes it was intended to subserve — that of furnishing and forming a highway over which common carriers and Others should have the right or privilege of transporting goods, or passing as they pass over a turnpike, a canal, or a ferry, upon paying reasonable tolls for the use of the structure or thoroughfare; and do not in any way constitute petitioner a common carrier of goods, authorized to equip its road, or to charge compensation for transporting goods on or over the same. Nor does petitioner, in the legal sense of the term, act or hold itself out to the- public, as a common carrier of SI </seg>
            <seg id="p322">322 FIRST ANNUAL, REPORT property in connection with the railroads on either side of the Ohio river. It has no freight cars. When it solicits or accepts freight upon Its tracks upon cither side of the river for any railroad company, it is compelled to call upon the railroad for whom the freight is intended, or over whose line it is to go, to furnish the cars in which to load the same. Such cars, the petitioner merely transfers over its bridge and delivers to the railroad furnishing the same, charging for its service its regular bridge toll, which is in no sense a charge for transporting the freight contained or carried in the car or cars. In some cases It makes an additional charge for switching cars which require to be transferred from one connection to another. Its object and purpose in thus constituting itself the soliciting agent for the railroad com - panies, who are willing to provide the cars for the freight it may secure, is manifestly to obtain 'tolls' for use of its bridge." In the case at bar, the business of respondent differs materially from the business of the bridge company in the case last cited in that, instead of maintaining a highway for the use of other carriers, respondent uses its tracks and engines for the transportation of freight and cars of its patrons. As to the 'transferring of cars, loaded or empty, to and from the packing houses and transfer tracks of respond - ent and the railway companies, and to and from its yards, respondent is something more than a switching company. It is true the transfer of the cars from one track to another is necessary; but such transferring of cars to and from respondent's tracks and those of the connecting lines is not different than the transfer made between connecting lines of other companies who are recognized by all as common carriers. Such business of respondent in the handling of loaded cars intended for one of the industries established upon its tracks requires it to convey the car from the termini of the ' connecting railways to the industry or place of destination. This does not differ from the last haul made of freight shipped over the lines of several connecting railways, except that with respondent the distance is shorter than is usual in cases of other carriers. The fact that charges are fixed at so much for each car transferred, and are not based upon weight, bulk or distance hauled, we think is unimportant. The statute declares any company engaged in the transportation of freight for hire is a common carrier. The charge made by respondent is its hire, and it transports freight notwithstanding the fact that it may not know the contents of the cars hauled, nevertheless it is the existence of the necessity for the transportation of freight which gives respondent occasion to exist. tin Kentucky &amp; Indiana Bridge Co. vs. Louisville &amp; Nashville Ry. tvpr , it is true that the physical act of switching cars from one lecting line to another by the bridge company is similar to some of work done by respondent herein, but such was only an incident to principal business of the bridge company which was not that of ixnmon carrier. </seg>
            <seg id="p323">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 323 It is contended by respondent that the Railway Commission has jurisdiction only over such railroads as are recognized as such by section 4, Art. 11 of the constitution. That section reads as follows: "Railways heretofore constructed, or that may hereafter be constructed In this state, are hereby declared public highways, and shall be free to all persons for the transportation of their persons and property thereon, under such regulations as may be prescribed by law. And the legislature may from time to time pass laws establishing reasonable maximum rates of charges for the transportation of passengers and freight on the different railroads in this state. The liability of rail - road corporations as common carriers shall never be limited." The constitution does not declare what a railroad is. It declares that railways are public highways for the use of ail persons for the transpor - tation of their persons or property. Respondent's railways cannot be said to be a highway for the transportation of persons; but this fact does not prevent the respondent's business from coming within the jurisdiction of the Railway Commission under the authority conferred upon it by the recent amendment to the constitution. (Sec. 421a, Art. 16; and chapter 90, page 311, Sess. Laws, 1907.) In other word*, a company doing a transportation business may be a common carrier although its traffic Is over tracks which may not constitute a public highway within the meaning of the constitution. Again, there is noth - ing in the constitution as it originally stood, or in the 1906 amendment, nor in any act of the legislature, which limits the term "common carrier" to railroads. It is equally applicable to a stage coach, a ferry boat, a street railway, a telegraph or telephone company. If a person or a corporation holds itself out to the public as offering its services to all persons similarly situated, and performs a service in the transportation of persons, freight, or intelligence it is a common carrier in the particular spheres of such employment. Thus considered the respondent is brought within the constitutional and common law definition of "common carrier." This obviously includes all common carriers, whether railroad companies engaged in the transportation of both passengers and freight, or one only. Respondent's transportation business is subject to the orders of the Railway Commission, and we recommend that the peremptory writ of mandamus of this Court be issued, commanding respondent to forth - with file with the State Railway Commission all its freight schedules, classifications, rates, tariffs, and charges used by it and in effect June 1, 1907, pertaining to the transportation of freight. PER CURRIAM. For the reasons stated in the foregoing opinion. It Is ordered that a peremptory writ of mandamus be issued, command - ing respondent forthwith to file with the State Railway Commission, all its freight schedules, classifications, rates, tariffs and charges used by it and in effect June 1 1907 pertaining to the transportation of freight. </seg>

I BARNES, C. J. At the March, A. D. 1908, term of the district ■t of Platte county, an information was filed against the defendant, id T. Martyn, Sr., which, omitting the title and formal parts, was ubstance, as follows: That on or about the 15th day of January, 8, David T. Martyn, Sr., then and there being, did unlawfully accept a the Union Pacific Railroad Company, a corporation owning and rating lines of railroad in the state of Nebraska, a free pass for el on and over all the lines of railroad owned and operated by said Union Pacific Railroad Company in said state; and did then and e unlawfully use said pass for the free transportation of himself as issenger on and over the said lines of railroad in said county and e; the said David T. Martyn, Sr., not being then and there an officer, it, or bona fide employe, the major portion of whose time is or was )ted to the service of said railroad company. §The information, in conclusion, also stated facts sufficient to show the defendant was not included within any of the exceptions con - d in chapter 93 of the laws of 1907, commonly called the anti - law. To this information the defendant entered a plea of not guilty; in due time he was placed on trial, and the cause was finally submitted on the contract under which the pass in question was issued and an agreed statement of facts. It was provided among other things by said contract, that the defendant should furnish all necessary surgical and medical treatment to the sick and injured employees of the Union Pacific Railroad Company free of charg? to said employees, and also render such services to passengers and others, for whom the company should request the same, between Schuyler and Silver Creek, Nebraska, for which he was to receive an annual pan on the Nebraska division of said railroad, together with trip passes upon other divisions thereof, and $25.00 per month during his employ - ment, which it was provided could be cancelled and terminated at any time for cause by the said company. By the agreed statement of facts it was conceded, among other things, that the defendant was, and is not, employed a major portion of his time in the service of the said railroad company. On motion of the defendant's counsel the court directed the jury to return a verdict of not guilty, which was accordingly done; the defendant was discharged, and the cause was thereupon dismissed. To all of which the state entered its exceptions, and has brought the case here for review under the provisions of sections 483 and 515 of the criminal code. It is contended by the state that the record shows beyond any question or chance of reasonable contention that defendant was guilty of a plain violation of our statutes prohibiting the acceptance and </seg>
            <seg id="p325">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 325 On the other hand defendant contends — first, that a pass issued in good faith to a regular practicing physician in return for services per - formed and to be performed by him, in the treatment of persons injured on or about the railroad issuing it, is not a free pass within the meaning of the act of March 30, 1907, prohibiting the giving, acceptance and use of passes, or free transportation of passengers over any and all lines of rai'.road within this state; second, that the act violates section 3, articl: 1, of the constitution of this state, which provides that "No person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law," and third that the act violates section 16 of article 1, of the constitution, which provides that "No bill of attainder, ex pt&gt;»t fnctit law or law impairing the obligation of contracts, or making any irrevocable grant of special privileges, shall be passed." To determine these questions it is not only proper but necessary fcr us to consider all of the several provisions of our statutes re - lating to, or in any manner regulating the busine&amp;s of common carriers within this state; and we should also take into consideration the evil sought to be corrected by the several legislative acts on that subject, together with the means adopted to accomplish that purpose. It is a matter of common knowledge that free passes first originated in favors granted to personal friends of railroad officials, and that this courtesy was gradually extended to public officers. This in itself, and in its inception, was not considered harmful or detri - mental to the public welfare; but long prior to the passage of the act in question the giving, acceptance and use of the free pass had become a-, intolerable evil, a menace to good government and a stumbling block in the way of securing needed legislation, as well as a burden to the railroad companies themselves. With this situation confronting the legislative assembly of 1907, that body wisely determined to put an end to the whole matter, and so it first enacted chapter 90 of the Session Laws of 1907, commonly called the Railway Commission Act, which was approved by the Governor and became a law on the 27th day of March of that year. By section 14 of the act, it was provided that "If any railway company or common carrier subject to the provisions of this act, directly, or indirectly, through or by its agents, officers or employees, by any special rate, rebats, drawback, or other device, shall charge, demand, collect or receive from any person, firm or corporation a greater or less compensation for any service rendered or to be rendered by it than it charges, demands, collects or receives from any other person, firm or corporation for doing a like and contem - poraneous service, the same shall constitute an unjust discrimination, which is hereby forbidden and declared to be unlawful." Kit seems perfectly clear that the giving of free transportation to person whomsoever was thereby made unlawful; and while it was made a penal offense by that section to receive such transportation, the giving of it was made a crime punishable by a fine of not less i $500 nor more than $1,000; that the provisions of that section </seg>
            <seg id="p326">326 FIRST ANNUAL REPORT are broad enough to cover the transaction in question in this case, and render it at least unlawful, there can be no doubt; for the transportation of a passenger by a railroad company over its line of road is a service performed by it for such passenger; and the Union Pacific Railroad Company, by giving the defendant the pass in question, thus charged, collected, demanded and received a different charge from the defendant than it charged, demanded, collected or received from other persons or passengers for a like service. That this rendered the transaction un - lawful there can be no question. To the operation of this law there was no exception, and the ser - vants and employees of the railroad company could not be transported free even while carrying out the terms of their employment. It was, therefore apparent that the law, as it then stood, was too drastic in its provisions, and that there should be enacted some needed exceptions. to Its operation; and- so the anti-pass law above mentioned was passed, approved by the Governor, and took effect on the 30th day of March, 1907. (See Sees. 10664, 10665, Cobb. Ann. Stats. 1907.) By this act it was made a penal offense not only for a railroad company to give but for any person to receive and use free transportation who was not especially excepted from its operation by the language of the act itself. As we understand the question before us it is not claimed by the defend - ant that he falls within any of those exceptions, and while the defendant was an employee of the Union Pacific Railroad Company yet it is frankly conceded that he did not, and does not, spend a major portion of his time in the service of that company. With the facts above stated before us we come now to determine the foregoing questions. The defendant's first contention is that his pass is not a free pass within the meaning of the statutes above referred to. To support this proposition his counsel cite Dempsey vs. N. Y. &amp; H. R. Co., 146 N. T. 292. In that case one Dempsey, a railroad policeman, appointed by the Governor of the state of New York, pursuant to statute, had entered into a contract with the defendant railroad to protect its prop - erty, and be ready for such service at all times on demand; and it was also agreed that if he would procure his appointment to the office of railroad policeman, the company would give him $75.00 per month for performing the duties of that office, together with an annual pass, which was required to enable him to perform his official duties. Upon these facts it was held that the pass contracted for was not a free pass within the meaning of the constitution of New York which prohib - ited the issuance of free passes to the public officers of that state. It thus appears that the rule announced therein has no application to the case at bar. Our attention is next directed to the opinion of the Attorney General of the state of Wisconsin, wherein he decided that a contract between the Assistant Attorney General and a railway company by which that officer was to act as attorney for the company in consider - ation of an annual pass, was not a violation of the anti-pass law of that state. An examination of that opinion, however, discloses that it was- </seg>
            <seg id="p327">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 327 based on Dempsey vs. Ry. Co., supra, and therefore has no application to the facts here in question, or the law by which our decision must be governed. Again, the obvious impropriety of the employment of the assistant law officer of the state, by a railroad company, and the Inconsistency of his position in accepting such employment affords sufficient reason to justify us in declining to follow that opinion. Finally on this branch of the case, counsel present Smith vs. N. Y. &amp; H. R. R. Co., 24 N. Y. 222 and R. R. Co. vs. Lockwood. 84 U. S. 359. We find upon an examination of those cases that the point decided by each of them was that a shipper, travelling on a drover's pass issued to enable him to take care of his live stock enroute, was not a gratuitous passenger in such a sense as to relieve the carrier from liability for negligently causing his death. Just how those cases can aid us in determining the questions under consideration we are not now advised, and so far have been unable to ascertain. §On the other hand, we find that in Marshall vs. Nashville R. L. Co., R. A. N. S. 1249 (Tenn.) the nature of a free pass issued by a. oad company to the chief of police of the city of Nashville was. ■mined, and it was there said: I "One of the assignments of error in this case is that the pass was a mere gratuity, but that it was given for a valuable consideration: in this connection, it is said that the deceased was a member of police force of Nashville, being chief of detectives, and that to this 3 of persons the company, as a rule, issued passes, which were id upon a valuable consideration. In other words, this pass was n, like others of its class, to encourage and to induce members of the ;e force, like the intestate, to ride upon the cars, and to be fre - ltly about them, because their presence tended to preserve ■e and good order for the passengers, and to protect the interest operation of the road. t"We are of the opinion that such a motive on the part of the road lot be- considered as a valuable consideration, because the expected slits are too remote, contingent, and uncertain to be so classed ; and pass must, therefore, be considered and treated as it purports to be, gratuity or compliment." An examination of the contract under which the pass in question was issued to the defendant discloses, as above stated, that it could be - abrogated or annulled at any time for cause, and the impression is created thereby and by the whole record, that for the contingent ser - vices which the defendant was to render to the Union Pacific Railroad Company, if requested, he was to receive and accept $25.00 per month: and that the pass in question by which he was permitted to ride upon the trains of that company over its Nebraska division, free of charge, was a mere gratuity, and was so considered by both the defendant and the railroad company until after the passage of the act in question herein. It seems quite evident that any expected benefits by reason thereof which might be received by the railroad company, were so remote and contingent as to constitute no consideration therefor. If the defendant's pass is not a free pass within the meaning of the act. </seg>
            <seg id="p328">328 FIRST ANNUAL REPORT which is the basis of this prosecution, then the statute itself 4s as useless as the vermiform appendix. If a free pass can be lawfully issued by a railroad company and used by any person as an employee who does not spend a major portion of his time in the service of the company, the whole purpose of the law is thwarted and destroyed, for under the pretext of employment any service performed for the company, however slight and trifling, would entitle the one performing it to free transpor - tation, and the law would thus be rendered wholly nugatory. We therefore decline to adopt the construction contended for, and are of the opinion that the defendant's pass is just what it purports to be, a fre? pass, and its issuance, acceptance and use was a plain violation of the statute, which is the basis of the prosecption. We com; now to dispose of defendant's second and third con - tentions which strike at the constitutionality of the law involved In this controversy. These questions will be considered together, for what may be said as to one of them applies with equal force to the other. It is asserted that the anti-pass law is unconstitutional because it impairs the obligations of the contract existing between the defendant and the railroad company, and deprives defendant of his property without due process of law. To correctly decide this question we should construe all of the provisions of our constiution and statutes which relate to, cr have any bearing thereon, together. By section 7 of article 11, of the constitution, it is provided that "The legislature shall pass laws to correct abuses and prevent unjust discriminations, and extortion - in all charges of express, telegraph and railroad companies in this state *ni enforce such laws by adequate penalties." It thus appears that the power to regulate intrastate commerce «n I prevent unjust discriminations is not only granted to the legislative ass mbly by the constitution, but it is thereby made a duty which the law making body is commanded to perform. It is also well settled that the internal commerce of a stat?. that is the commerce wholly confined to end carried on within the limits of a single state, is as much under ttit: ccntrol as foreign or interstate commerce is under the control of the general government. (San^s vs. Manistee River Imp. Co., 123 U. S. 293; Gibbons vs. Ogden, 7 Wheat. 19; Monroe vs. American Trans. Co., 24 Howard 39; Cincinnati Bridge Co. vs. Ky., 154 U. S. 210, and Greer vs. Conn., 161 U. S. 519.) The exercise of this power necessarily includes the right to interfere with contract and property rights so far, at least, as may be necssary to prevent extortion and discrimination. From even a cursory examination of the several acts of our legislature on this subject it is quite apparent that the contract under consideration was, and is, discriminatory in its nature. We find that like contracts have been frequently declared to be so. The statutes of North Carolina upon this subject are the same as our own, and in McNeUl vs. Durham A C. R. Co., 13z N. C. 510, it was held that a contract between a rail - roal company and the publisher of a newspaper by which he was to publish the time-tables of the company and receive a pass over its </seg>
            <seg id="p329">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 329 line of railroad, as compensation therefor, was invalid and was an illegal discrimination. In the opinion in that case we find the follow - ing: "Subject to the liberal exceptions just recited, the general assem - bly deemed that free transportation, or any other discrimination was so much against public policy that a violation of the statute was made punishable with a fine not less than one thousand dollars and not exceeding five thousand dollars for each offense. Nothing could be more clearly a discrimination than the ground upon which the plaintiff asked for and received free passage on this occasion, to-wit: That for the year previous he had advertised the schedule of the defendant company in his paper, and had received therefor a free pass over Its line for the previous year, and that this contract had been renewed for the year then current. It does not appear what was the value of the advertising done, charging for the space at the same rate as would be charged others, but let it be what it may, it could not amount exactly neither more nor less to the value of a free pass to travel ad libitum, an unstipulated number of miles over the defendant's road. Besides it was an illegal discrimination to sell the plaintiff transportation on credit and not payable in money." I This decision not only meets with our approval, but we find that federal courts in construing like provisions of the interstate com- H law have reached a similar conclusion. (U. S. vs. Wells Fargo •ess, 161 Fed. 606.) I Again, it may be said if the contract for the pass, in the case at , ever had any validity, the provisions of our constitution, above ted, entered into and became a part of it at its inception. And terms and obligations were at all times subject to the power of the slature to pass laws "to correct abuses and prevent unjust discrim - tions." Therefore, when the law in question took effect the con - it became illegal, and its obligations gave way and were suspended, it cannot be said that it was of such a character as to suspend the visions of the constitution, ,and the statute passed in response to command of that instrument. I It may be further stated that our anti-pass law is simply a police ulation, adopted in pursuance to the mandates of the supreme law, I therefore cannot be said to be unconstitutional. In Tiedeman on nitations of Police Pow«r, it is well said: "Whenever the business tself a privilege or franchise, not enjoyed by all alike, or the business naterially benefited by the gift of the state of some special privileges be enjoyed in connection with it, the business ceases to be strictly vate, and becomes a quasi-public business, and to that .extent may be tjected to police regulation. That such is the nature of the business a common carrier there can be no doubt." In Bullard vs. Northern Pacific R. R. Co., 11 L. R. A. 246 (Mont.) it was held, that existing contracts for special freight rates or rebates from regular tariff rates which had been made with railroad companies subject to the interstate commerce act, becam? illegal when that act took effect, and were after that time incapable of enforcement. The </seg>
            <seg id="p330">330 FIRST ANNUAL REPORT contract in question herein is without doubt subject to the same rule. We are therefore of opinion that the issuance of the defendant's annual pass, and its acceptance and use by him, was a plain violation of the statute. I We are therefore constrained to hold that the district court erred recting the jury to find the defendant not guilty and discharging from further prosecution. For the foregoing reasons the excep - of the state are sustained. </seg>
