FROM BULLETIN 138. Ei are provided up and down the side of the silo opposite the pas - e, so the silage can be thrown from the silo into the common litter rier which runs out over the feed bunks, as shown in the cut.

            <seg id="p002">The tendency in Nebraska seems to be towards large and expen- § silos, and especially so towards large and expensive silage lling machinery. There may be good reason for this, but there 3 data at hand which shows that the large, powerful machines more efficient and more economical than smaller and less ex- pensive machinery. There are a great many farmers who would have silos if they knew that smaller machines are satisfactory and could be obtained. In emergencies, such as droughts or hail storms, the corn fodder could be saved if the farmers would take advantage of this type of machinery. INEXPENSIVE SILOS. There are two types of inexpensive silos which can be obtained upon very short notice. One is the pit silo and the other is the home-made, plain stave silo. The former can be made permanent while the latter is only for temporary relief, insomuch as the dry - ing winds of Nebraska will dry out the wood so fast that the silo is apt to blow down soon after it is emptied. HOME-MADE PLAIN WOOD STAVE SILO. The following is a bill of material for a home-made, plain stave silo which should be obtained from any lumber dealer and hard- ware merchant upon very short notice. MATERIALS FOR A TEMPORARY WOOD STAVE SILO. 14 ft. x 24 ft. with 4 ft. pit Capacity, 80 tons. Foundation — 43 sacks cement, 7.5 cu. yd. sand $ 35.17 Doors— 3—1 in. x 4 in. x 12 ft., 1—2 in. x 4 in. x 9 ft., 6 T hinges, \]/ 2 lbs. 12d nails, 1 lb. 8d nails, 6 — 2 in. screws 1.08 Silo Proper — 94 staves 2 in. x 6 in. x 24 ft 72.19 36 — y 2 in. rods. 16 ft. long, 36 — 1 / 2 in. tank lugs 17.04 Anchors— 1000 ft. No. 9 wire, 4 — y 2 in. x 24 in. rods, 4 — V2 in. x 2]/i in. bolts, 4 — x /2 ' n - x 16 in eye bolts 4.50 Total $129.98 Instructions for erecting this silo and for ordering a more ex- pensive stave silo can be found in bulletin No. 138, limited edition, Agricultural Experiment Station, Lincoln, Nebr. A PIT SILO. In the greater per cent of the soils of Nebraska, the pit silo can be used advantageously. This silo can be made at a small or as great an expense as the owner deems best. </seg>
            <seg id="p003">is better, however, to make a heavy concrete border around the top of the silo and then plaster the walls below. A better and more convenient method is to place the silo in the bank and have doors extending up and down the side, similar to above-ground silos. The sijo can be further improved by building from 6 to 10 feet of silo above the ground. Cement blocks or hollow clay blocks can be used for this. 13 make a durable pit silo, first dig out a trench as narrow as be dug with the spade and as deep as can be conveniently ked. This trench should be around the top of the silo and the le diameter of it should be the inside diameter of the silo, this trench with concrete. Go inside of it and excavate down about 6 feet; then plaster the walls with about three coats of tnt mortar. Excavate another section and plaster again. Con - e this until the silo is completed. A concrete floor in the bot - of the silo is convenient but is not important. tn illustration of the border of the pit silo; also one type of frame hoisting the earth. Eie cost of material for pit silos will vary from nothing up to The material for an 80 ton silo, built as above described. Id cost about $16, while the labor, at $2 per day, would amount ss than $50. Barrel used for hoisting earth from silo pit. </seg>
            <seg id="p004">INEXPENSIVE SILAGE MACHINERY. A corn binder is probably as satisfactory to use for cutting corn for the silo as any other machine. It is probably more expensive than any other method, unless it would be the common corn knife. The two row sled harvester with a device to prevent horses get - ting into the knives is probably the cheapest machine and the most economical for cutting corn for silage. The sled cutter is also very efficient in cutting corn for fodder. To handle this machine to the best advantage the wagons must pass along beside the har - vester so that as the men on the sled gather their arms full of corn they can lay it on the wagon. This saves laying it down and pick - ing it up again and it will be found that men can cut the corn and lay it on the wagon as fast as men can pick it off the ground and hand it up to men on the wagon for loading. tiere are two satisfactory machines which can be used for cut - corn and putting it into above-ground silos. One is a blower the other is the drag tube carrier. The former machine is the • expensive and requires about three times the power that is ired by the latter. A 5 horse engine will run the latter car - and elevate the silage into a silo which is 20 feet above ground le rate of 50 tons per day. tar pit silos, the common drag carrier and the drag tube car - are very satisfactory. A drag carrier cutter which has a city of 30 tons per day should be purchased for about $60. l a machine can be run by two horses on a horse power which lid cost about $35. A cutter of this type which has a capacity 5 tons per day should be purchased for about $15 or $20 more a horse power for four horses ($50) should run it. Four to horse gas engines which will answer the purpose can be pur - ed for about $30 per horse power. The silage can be removed from the pit silos in tubs or baskets, or a hoist, similar to a hay hoist, can be rigged up and a box used in place of the hay fork. One man has made a simple modifica - tion of a hand store elevator and placed it in his silo. This works very satisfactorily. filletin No. 138, limited edition. Agricultural Experiment Sta- Lincoln, Nebr., explains how to build all types of silos and be had free upon application. </seg>
