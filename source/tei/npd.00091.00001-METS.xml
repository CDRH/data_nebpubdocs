         <seg id="p010">Personnel of the Commission. ¦ Mrs. P. L. Cady whose term expired June 30, 1939, was reappointed for a five year term. Miss Annie C Kramph's term expired June 30, 1940 and she was re - appointed for a five year term. John W. Delehant. a member of the Library Commission since July 1, 1935, resigned January IS, 1940 to accept appointment as a member of the State Normal School Board. Thomas E. Adams, Jr. was appointed to fill the vacancy. The Staff. j Miss Clara B. Johnson, assistant in charge of extension, resigned De - cember I, 1939 to become supervisor of the statewide W. P. A. library pro - ject. Miss Kathryn L. Buck was appointed to succeed Miss Johnson. ! James Allely, shipping clerk, resigned September IS, 1940 to attend the University College of Medicine. Warren Emerson was appointed in his place. j j Increase in requests for loans. 11 Approximately 36% more loans were made during this biennium than in the preceding biennium, but the increase in number of volumes loaned was only 9%. The book stock was inadequate to meet all needs and the number of volumes sent in the traveling libraries to schools and commun - ities was reduced in order that more people might be served. The book fund suffered in the 16% reduction made in the appropriation of the Com - mission for the biennium. Circulation figures seldom reflect the amount of time taken by a librarian in looking up books, magazine articles, pamphlets, clippings, etc. An increase in number of requests handled means that more time must be taken to look up material, more time is needed to check out the loans, and make the necessary records, wrap the packages or pack the larger loans in boxes, as well as to answer correspondence connected with inquiries. The Library Commission has always operated with a minimum staff and more assistants are badly needed. i Requests received cover a wide range of subjects. Particular interest has been shown in vocational books, aviation, social security, world events, gardening, travel, biography, psychology, religion, etc. The loan period varies from the short term loans of two weeks or one month for the more recent or popular books to three months for school and community loans. It is possible for one book to serve people in many different communities during a year as is shown by the accompanying maps. Diagrams made for other books would show still different parts of the state served, depending of course on the requests received. Some idea of how much this service means to people out in the state, particularly to those living in rural areas may be gained from quotations 10 </seg>

         <seg id="p012">from letters such as these: 1 "I sure value this opportunity of having books from your library. We I people in small towns need them so." "Thank you. Your library is wonderful for people who live as far from a town library as I do." j "Thank you ior all past favors in sending me such fine material every i time I have made a request of you." | (' The Union Catalogue. During the biennium it was possible through the use of a W. P. A. \ project to make a union catalogue of the books and periodicals in twenty- I eight of the largest university, college, public and special libraries in the j state. The Library Commission served as sponsor of the project with the State Library, the University of Nebraska Library and the Lincoln City Library as co-sponsors. At the completion of the project in June, 1940, when the basic collections in all of these librarieis had been entered in one big author catalogue, the Library Commission assumed full responsibility for the catalogue. The cooperating libraries will send in catalogue 1 cards for books added and these must be combined and filed so that the record will be kept up-to-date. Through this catalogue any book belonging to the contributing libraries can be located and made available either through inter-library loan or for consultation in the library owning the book. The catalogue is a valuable aid to study and research and the Library Commission believes that it is an important contribution to library service in the state. Arrained cataloguer is needed to take care of the continual process of adding new cards, combining and revising, and to take care of requests received for location of books. The catalogue now contains over 700,000 cards repre - senting nearly 1,500,000 volumes. County and Regional Libraries. Emphasis has been placed on extension oi library seTvice through county or regional units. Although almost every town in the state with a population of 500 or over has a local library, and several towns with even \ smaller population are trying to maintain libraries, approximately 50% of the people are without local library service. 25% of the libraries listed as tax-supported and all of the club libraries have annual incomes of less than $500, which means that the service of the 50% listed as having local libraries is very inadequate and uneven. Equalization of library service over the state can be made 1 only by some form of state or federal aid administered by the Library Commission or by the organization of a state - wide system of county and regional libraries. Believing that the libraries in the state would benefit more from the opportunity to secure aid through the Works Progress Administration if a state-wide program were organized under the supervision of trained librar - ians, the Library Commission planned and sponsored such a project. This project began operating in January, 1939. On November 30, 1940 there 12 </seg>
         <seg id="p013">&amp;'¦ ¦ : ¦ ' ¦¦¦¦'. ¦¦' ¦..'''¦¦/¦'¦:'-'¦ % were 59 unit projects operating in established libraries using 140 workers '•¦ furnished by the W. P. A. Workers were used for clerical help, mending ' books, keeping the libraries open more hours and for other routine work. v. From the standpoint of library extension perhaps the most important f, results have been two demonstrations of county and regional libraries. In ¦ Douglas and Sarpy counties a regional demonstration has operated with | the Omaha Public Library as co-sponsor and headquarters library. Books i- were distributed through branches in libraries already organized and ?V through regular bookmobile routes. From the opening of the first branch I in May, 1939 to November 30, 1940 a total of 50,366 books were circulated. V Arrangements for placing this service on a permanent basis by contracts &gt;* with the Omaha Public Library are being considered by the local cotnmun - ii ities. -."' ¦¦,:¦' '¦¦'¦ ¦'; "; '.'; ¦-' ' V. : !'; In Adams county the Hastings Carnegie Library and the Adams f County Commissioners have been co-sponsors. Here there were no ' libraries in the county except the one at Hastings so branches were started ' in the larger towns and the Library Commission bookmobile distributed books to two other towns. The first branch was opened in August, 1939 and up to November 30, 1940 a total of 46,087 books had been circulated. On November 5. the question of establishing a tax supported county library was voted on and passed by a large majority. ; At the present time Nebraska has no county libraries,which meet the standard set,by the American Library Association of a minimum of $1,000 ' annual income. Two counties, Hooker and Logan, have previously voted a county library tax, but because of the low property valuation in these counties, the amount received annually is less than $1,000. | School Libraries. I In December, 1939, the State Department of Public Instruction spon - ;'.. sored a W. P. A. project to organize and operate library services in the v public schools of the state. This project which is still operating has been I under the supervision of a trained librarian and 40 schools have library pro - f jects. Organization of material for pamphlet files, simple cataloguing, i mending of books and desk service are examples of work accomplished. Realizing the great need for more reading material, particularly in the : rural schools, many of the county superintendents have started circulating rural school libraries. These are usually supported by contributions from I the schools/ Interested organizations have sponsored some form of cir - culating library in a few other counties and these may develop into tax - ? supported libraries. I During the biennium the library commission sent out 82,868 books to | 1,904 schools. These books were checked to the schools for three months, and records show that the average number of pupils reading each book is five.- . :'-_': '¦. ..-.¦¦ -: : ~ /;..' - ; ; :.- .::. .' -:.; .•'•' ¦.¦'.' •'¦.. Many letters similar to the following are received from teachers. "It is difficult to tell you.how much these books have meant to the 13 </seg>
         <seg id="p014">boys and girls here in the school. I wish we could find some way of let - ting the people of Nebraska know more of your work and service." "We wish to thank you for the loan of these volumes. The pupils have derived a great deal of good from them. We have carried out quite an ex - tensive program of library reading this year." "Please send us another library as soon as possible as this is our only source oi reading matter. May it include mostly books suitable for boys and girls 10 to 15 years of age?" ' • "We wish to thank you especially for the "Nebraska" by Wilson and "Long Ago." They worked in so nicely in work for fourth and sixth grade history. Please send us some easier books next time for the third grade boy." Gifts and Bequests to Libraries. Several libraries have announced gifts of books or money during the biennium. Leading these in amount was the bequest to the University of Nebraska by the late Don L. Love of Lincoln. It is estimated that approx - imately $800,000 will be available for a new library building. Other gifts valued at $500 or over: Dodge — bequest of $25,000 from the estate of John Rogers for library building. Hay Springs —$10,000 from estate of Mrs. M. D. Craveth. Rushville —$5,000 from estate of Mrs. Craveth. Kearney State Teachers College— $6,000 from Carnegie Corporation for books. Kearney State Teachers College — Fine arts collection from Carnegie corporation, valued at $2,000. Hastings High School — Fine arts collection from Carnegie Corpora - tion, valued at $2,000. Alliance —$5,000 from estate of Frank M. Knight. Fairbury — $1,000 from estate of Lucile Cross Russell. York —$1,000 from estate of Mrs. C. A. McCloud. Madison — $500 memorial fund given by daughters of the late Dr. ami Mrs. F. A. Long. University of Nebraska — Valuable collection of papers and corres - pondence of ]. Sterling Morton and his working library. Buildings. Few new library buildings were erected during the past two years. The Ord Township library building was built at a cost of $9,400. Kearney and North Platte added substantial additions to their Carnegie library build - ings. Nelson, Battle Creek and Tobias moved into remodeled buildings and Spalding moved into a new municipal building. Many other buildings were improved by W. P. A. alteration and cleaning projects. 14 </seg>

There have been many changes in librarians. Among those who re-. :' tired from active library service were Miss Lulu Home, Lincoln City Li - ). brary; Miss Anna V.

Katharine Major, Kearney Junior High School ; Miss Lucile Hrubesky, Kearney Senior High School; Mrs. Mary Early O'Brian, Kearney Public : Library; Miss May Ingles, Technical High School, Omaha; Miss C. Olive 1 Jones, Plattsmouth Public Library; Mrs. Nellie Wilson, Scottsbluff Public i Library; Mrs. May Mcßeth, Hebron Public Library, Mrs. E. L. Melvin, Cedar Rapids Public Library. Library work in Nebraska owes a big debt I to these people who have contributed so much during their long years of ! service. f Libraries are becoming more widely recognized as educational agencies j: and standards for librarians are accordingly higher. More people with f library school training are being employed to fill vacancies and an increas - ; ing number of Nebraska's young people attend library schools each year. Nebraska Library Association. The Nebraska Library Association is a professional organization of librarians, trustees and others interested in libraries. It holds an annual meeting in the fall and eight district meetings in the spring. The total attendance at these meetings hi 1940 was over 500. '¦..-'¦. Some of the problems with which the association has been concerned are extension and improvement of service in public and school libraries, work with children, adult education, certification for librarians, etc. The trustees and junior members have informal organizations which meet during the state conference and high school and university and college librarians have special sessions. ;, ' . A Friends of the Library organization was started in 1939 in order that more people might be informed of the services and needs of libraries Mimeographed and printed material has been sent to these members from time to time and speakers on subjects of special interest to them have been provided at the library meetings. Local branches of the state group have been formed in the demonstration centers and have given very valu - able assistance. •¦'-.¦'¦- :: ' ',:' Certification of Librarians A bill for, certification of librarians was introduced in the Legislature, January 30, I&lt;s39 as L. B. 305. The bill was introduced by Senator Richard Johnson of Fremont at the request of the Legislative Committee and offi - cers of the Nebraska Library Association. The bill was reported tjut favor - ably by the Committee on Public Welfare/but was among the large num - ber of bills on general file at the close of the legislative session. 15 </seg>

         <seg id="p028">LIBRARIES NOT TAX-SUPPORTED There are in Nebraska a large number of libraries not included in the list of tax-supported libraries. These libraries are usually sponsored and maintained by some chib or organization. Some of these libraries receive a small amount from the town and in other cases rooms, heat and light are furnished. Changes in librarians are frequent due to the fact that many of them serve without pay.
