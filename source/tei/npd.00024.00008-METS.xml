            <seg id="p055">55 I During the year The Home Building and Loan Association of atriee went into voluntary liquidation, wound up its affairs and quit siness. [The remaining members of the Schuyler Building and Loan Asao - tion which was in process of voluntary liquidation, found it n» &lt; es - •y to place it in the hands of a receiver to properly wind up its airs, and upon receipt by the State Banking Board of a request for ?h receiver, the necessary steps were taken to have one appointed tl placed in charge of the association. II am pleased to congratulate you upon the growth and condition the Building and Loan Associations under your supervision, as wn by the abstracts, summaries and comparisons on prectding es of this report. tit is no longer a question of the pennant nee of the building and m association as a part of the financial interests of this state, and a proportion to which the aggregate rtsources have attained clearly iicates the importance of watchful supervision in their affairs aud ministration. This is peculiarly true because of the fact that a iss of people are affected that can illy afford losses from mismanage - &gt;nt or dishonest conduct of their affairs. t There is no doubt but the present building and loan law has had ch to do with the development of these institutions, giving them ier and privileges enabling them to appeal to the people for support. I am not ready at this time to point out any material changes to be made in the present building and loan law; however, it will naturally fallow that with the rapid increase of business abuses develop and restrictions become necessary that are apparently not needed at thi» The past period of prosperity, marked by rising values • where, has been a great stimulant to this line of business. The crucial test of stability will come during a .period of financial depression and falling prices, such a period will probably bring out any weaknesses that may exist or any lack of provision for proper supervision. tOn the whole 1 em inclined to submit thi3 report to you without ial comment or suggestion, as the general summary indicates a satisfactory and gratifying condition generally. Very respectfully, E. RCYSE, Secretary State Banking Board. </seg>
