            <seg id="p003">THE PAPER DRESS FORM Women everywhere are realizing that a dress form of )me type is indispensable if they are to do their own sewing. The homemade dress form is becoming very popular because it is practical and inexpensive. By studying the following illus- trations and directions, any woman, with the help of three or ghbors, may have a dress form with very little xpenditure of time and monev Before starting the form read all directions carefullv and materials at hand a Necessary Equipment for One Form Shirt — A shirt, manufactured especially for the dress rk, or a snugly fitting shirt, 4 inches smaller than bust vet and high neck may be used. One roll of 1-inch gummed paper (the kind of tape used hants to seal packages). \ piece of double corrugated paste-board, beaver wooden cracker box lid, out of which a base board the M can be cut. Two bowls or cups for water, several sponges or rags pening gummed tape, needle, thread, tape line, yard irp scissors and a safety-razor blade. Paint brush and about ' 4 pint of shellac. Putting on the Shirt Remove all outer clothing down to brassier, corset, and one iftticoat. Some women tighten their corsets from one to one and a half inches as the tape increases the waist measure. Draw on the shirt. If it is a long sleeved shirt, cut off the sleeves and use part of one of them to sew around the neck for a collar. Cut off the buttons, facings and trimmings and sew up the placket and collar. If the shirt is one of the type man - ufactured especially for the dress form work, it will only be necessary to sew it up the front, including the collar. The shirt should fit the figure very closely. If it is found to be too large take it to the sewing machine and make seams under the arms. Be sure to have on comfortable shoes. If it is difficult to stand long in the shoes they may be slipped off. If they are laced ones, loosen the laces so it will be easy to slip them on before the hip line is marked. </seg>
            <seg id="p004">4 EXTENSION BULLETIN NO. 66 Cutting the Tape Measure from shoulder cap to under arm seam and then measure the circumference of the roll of tape. If there is no more than I 1 - inches difference between the two lengths, take a butcher knife and cut down thru the roll for about 1 ' ' s inches or until the strips of tape seem to be getting too short. If this method does not seem practical, have some one hold her hands as for winding a skein of yarn. Wind as many rounds at a time as can be conveniently cut. Cut at each hand and start winding again until enough strips are cut. There are a great many ways of cutting the tape quickly and one may l&gt;e devised that seems to be best for the group that is working. Dampening the Tape There are a number of very satisfactory methods of damp - ening the tape. A dampened sponge or rag may be held in tht left hand and the tape, gummed side down, drawn across tht sponge or cloth, or a sponge may be placed in a cup it. and the tape drawn across it. In using either metho should be taken not to rub the glue off or to make th too damp. (Caution — Do not place the tape on the tabl side up and rub with cloth or sponge.) Pasting on the Tape Place the first strip of tape around the waist and draw it snugly. If the top or the bottom of the corset protrudes it may be drawn down by tape. Paste six or eight short strips at the base of the neck, front and back and on either side. All *ape should lap over the previous tape at least four-fifths of its width. The thickness of the tape in a measure determines the amount of lapping. Paste short strips close under the arm. parallel to the waist line. Continue pasting under arm filling the space to the waist line. The strips may taper or get shorter as they approach the waist line. Short strips 4 to 6 inches temay be placed in a similar manner above center front and r back of waist line for about 4 or 5 inches. </seg>
            <seg id="p005">THE PAPER DRESS FORM 5 Waist — Paste strips diagonally across front starting the •st strip on the shoulder close to the neck, running it across ie front and close up under the opposite arm. Continue the rips on the shoulder diagonally across the front over the lr ist until the last strip reaches the under arm seam. Now art diagonally across the front, beginning on the opposite Tapes around Waist, at Base and Side of Neck across Front, and Vertically on the Hips. Diagonally shoulder close to the neck and cover bust as before. Cover the back with diagonal strips as the front was covered. Hips — The hips are covered with short strips running vertically from waist to the largest part of the hips. It is es - sential that the tape on the hip be lapped so that each strip shows not more than ' 8 inch. If a woman is very large at the hips and small at the waist line it may be well to use extra strips that do not extend to the waist line but reinforce the base of the hips. </seg>
            <seg id="p006">6 EXTENSION BULLETIN NO. 66 t Sleeves — In making the sleeve caps, care should be taken to build them down too far as they will interfere in the ig of a garment. The hands are placed on the hips a little w the waist while making the sleeve caps. There are a iber of ways to make these sleeve caps. Some women to run a tape around the arm about one inch below the pit and then run tapes out over the shoulder cap to meet tape. Others place one tape around the arm close up to Finishing Sleeves and Neck the armpit, and then start shorter tapes under the arm and bring them up over the shoulder cap, flaring each tape until all the space is filled in. Half of the tapes are started under the arm and drawn around the front and the other half started under the arm and drawn up from the back of the sleeve and crossed over the front ones, making the sleeve cap quite heavy. Neck — The neck is made by placing strips around the neck as high as desired with one thickness of tape. These are cov- Ewith strips running perpendicularly to the neck. They Id be flared out over the chest and back thus helping to ■e the collar to the body of the form. A few long strips be placed around the neck to help hold these in place. </seg>
            <seg id="p007">THE PAPER DRESS FORM 7 Taking Measurements If shoes have been taken off they should be slipped on be - fore measurements are taken. Take bust and waist measure and write number of inches on the form or piece of paper so they will not be forgotten. Use a yard stick and mark a line an equal distance from the floor all around at or below the largest part of the hips. Record this distance with the bust nd waist measures. Mark a line down center of back Removing Form Removing the Form The form should be practically dry before attempting tc take it off. In the summer time it is usually sufficiently dry to remove immediately. In the winter it may be necessary to have the form opened in the back and allowed to dry for a short time before taking it off. Use a razor blade and cut down the center of the back, taking care to hold the blade so there is no danger of cutting deeper than thru the thicknesses of paper. </seg>
            <seg id="p008">8 EXTENSION BULLETIN NO. 66 Use scissors and cut shirt and paper not cut by razor. Some - times it is necessary to cut the form down the front but often it may be taken off by having some one hold the sleeves while first one arm and then the other is carefully slipped out. This method may crease the form slightly at the shoulder but this can be remedied after the form is off. Putting the K Reducing the Size Take waist and bust measure of the woman aft* been removed. Compare these with those written 01 If there is but one inch or less difference betwet ,\ measurements, cut half of the difference from eac back opening. If there is over an inch difference in the actual measurements and those of the form it will be necessary to take one-half of the amount from the front and one-half from the back. This will necessitate splitting the form up the front a little past the bust line, if it has not been done already. Some women prefer closing the back before splitting the front as it is a little easier to put together. Putting Together Have some one hold the form so the edges just meet Paste short tapes (about 4 inches long) across the opening tc hold it together, lapping as before. </seg>
            <seg id="p009">THE PAPER DRESS FORM 9 Finishing Trim irtn at the hip line, and around the arm and neck. Bind the arm and neck by placing a dampened tape around the neck and arms allowing half of the tape to extend past the opening. Turn this tape in and press down to form a binding. Hold the form up to the light to detect thin spots. Reinforce any spots that are thin. Test to see if the hip line is even by placing the form on the table. lai for a Base and Securing Base to Form Making a Baa* Place the form on a piece of double corrugated paste board, beaver board or thin wooden board and mark the outline. Cut this oval and slip it into the form from l -j to 1 inch up from the hip line. Secure it with four-inch tapes which start from the outside of the form, folding up to the inside and then onto the board. Be careful to fit into the corners well. The distance that the board is slipped up into the form is to allow that much room in which to tack the form to a standard. Shellacking Shellac the outside to make it water-proof and to harden it. </seg>
            <seg id="p010">10 EXTENSION BULLETIN NO. 66 t .1 The Standard The most popular standard is one made of two oval board one to fit into the hip space and the other the same size to res on the floor, and eight yardsticks. The yardsticks are cut ju&gt; as long as the measure from the hip line to the floor, plus th f&gt;unt that the standard is to extend into the form to meet th ;. Mortise the yardsticks into the oval boards. The on&lt; i mark of the yardstick should be secured to the oval tht ) rest on the floor so that the yardstick may be used in tun hems. There are a great many unique types of standard l as an old taboret or stand. Slip the bust form over th of this standard and secure it with tacks. It is advisable to cover the shellacked form with an gauze shirt and it may be neater to put this shirt on b securing the bust form to the standard. This makes a f« tion on which to pin when fitting a waist. When soiled the may be taken off and washed. \^ Hum..
