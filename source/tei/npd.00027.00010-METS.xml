            <seg id="p003">REPORT IDisar Sir: I have the honor of submitting to you a report he Nebraska State Hospital, covering the period from De - ber 1, 1910 to November 30, 1912, inclusive. Official Changes At the date of the last Biennial Report, December 1, 1910, the following officers were in charge: Dr. J. P. Pecival, Super - intendent; Dr. W. G. Guttery, First Assistant Physician, and Dr. W. H. Newman, Second Assistant Physician. During the biennium the following changes have taken place: Dr. A. John - son was appointed Superintendent, and took charge of the hos - pital, February 1, 1911: Dr. G. W. Dishong assumed the duties of First Assistant Physician, February 1, 1911, and Dr. W. &lt;i Guttery remained at the hospital as Second Assistant Physician until June 1, 1911. He was succeeded by Dr. H. R. Carson, who at that time assumed the duties of Second Assistant Phy - sician and Pathologist. Dr. G. W. Dishong resigned November 1, 1911 to accept the position as First Physician at the Hospital for Nervous and Mental Diseases, at Little Rock, Arkansas, and Dr. H. R. Carson was on that date promoted to the position of First Assistant Physician. Dr. J. S. Simms was appointed January 1, 1912 to the position left vacant by Dr. Carson's pro - motion, and he remained at the hospital until May 19, 1912. when he resigned. Dr. Robert H. Foster assumed the duties of Second Assistant Physician and Pathologist, May 26, 1912. Miss Elizabeth Leece has remained as Superintendent of Nurses, with the exception of a short period during the summer of 1911, when there were no classes to instruct. Mr. A. J. Gutzmer has been Steward and Clerk since February 1, 1911. Movement of Population IAt the beginning of the biennium, there were present at hospital 309 patients, and thirty-five patients were out on le. During the first year covered by this report, 110 patients i received and returned, and 124 patients were discharged, </seg>
            <seg id="p004">206 paroled or died, so that at the end of the first year, there remained at the hospital 330 patients; an increase of twenty-one patients. At the beginning of the second year thirty patients were out on parole, and 168 patients were received and returned during the year. During the same period 120 patients were discharged, paroled or died, so that at the end of the second year there were present at the hospital, 408 patients; an increase of ninety-nine patients during the biennium. â–  A statistical table of the discharges, paroles, deaths, etc., be found among the medical tables at the end of the report. Principles of State Hospital Management It is now recognized that economic principles, as well as charitable, underlie the management of the State Hospital for the Insane. The unfortunate insane patient must be cared for, not only for the purpose of restoring his health, if that be pos - sible, but also for the purpose of protecting his wn family and those that have come in direct contact with him. It is no doubt true that people in general have a better understanding now, than heretofore, in regard to the care and treatment given pa - tients in our state hospitals. A number of people are now giving practically their entire time to the work of studying the cause of, as well as the prevention of insanity, and yet this most im - portant work has but fairly begun. It is for many reasons unfortunate that the kind removal of the afflicted person to a hospital, in which he may be humanely cared for, protected from injury to himself or others and receive the best of medical treatment, removes him from further ob - servation by the community. The lesson which would be learned by each community, if its insane were cared for in its own sight, so to speak, would .be exceedingly valuable. If people generally saw more of the insane after the first onset of the disease, they would learn many things, which now are known only to a few. They would learn for instance, that most of the insane are prac - tically harmless; that mental troubles differ greatly in degree and kind, and that patience, kindness and sympathy are the chief factors in healing the disease of the mind, as in healing many other ills. The seriousness of the affliction, and the burden which it imposes on the community, would be more fully realized, and there would be a readier appreciation of the importance of </seg>
            <seg id="p005">207 HOSPITAL FOR INSANE, NORFOLK any new light thrown by science upon the nature, origin and pre - ventability of insanity. Every one that has given the subject careful study knows that insanity is gradually increasing. It is safe to say that the insane now in hospitals in the United States number at least 200,000. The total annual cost of caring for the insane in the United States is in the neighborhood of $50,000,000 per year. About one-sixth of the total expenditure of the State of New York is for the care of the insane. There has been unusual activity at our hospital during the past two years, not only because of the greater number of patients to care for, but also because of the extra amount of repairs and improvements done. The resident physicians, who are placed in charge of the medical work, have been very painstaking and conscientious in performing their duties by carefully studying their patients, and by keeping abreast of the recent advances in the science of psychiatry. It is being demonstrated, that by careful treat: ment a larger percentage of recoveries can be obtained than A very complete hydrotherapeutic plant has been installed, at an expense of $3,000, in the new Womens' Building. While this plant has been in operation a few months only, we are convinced by the results already obtained, that by means of this treatment, quicker and more lasting results can be obtained than by drugs. Nothing can be so soothing to the patient as the continued bath, where the patient is kept in warm water at the proper temperature for two or three hours. Even violent and greatly disturbed patients will go to sleep and remain so during the greater portion of the bath. Very few patients come to the hospital that cannot be benefited by this treatment when properly administered. By this treatment, not only quicker and more lasting results are obtained, but all of the bad after effects following the treatment by drugs are eliminated. Besides the purely medical work done by our physicians, every case admitted to the hospital has been given a very careful and thorough examination, and a complete record made of all the findings physical as well as mental. In making these records </seg>
            <seg id="p006">208 patient, making it very convenient to refer to the records at any future time. The laboratory work has been carried on as far as the facil - ities available will allow. A large new, and very convenient room has been equipped with the necessary appliances for a laboratory, so that hereafter more thorough and complete work along this important field of medical science can be done. I The general health of the institution has been very good; i having been no cases of contagious or infectious diseases lg the biennium. I Careful nursing performed by those having been specially led for the work is as essential at a hospital for insane as in a general hospital. In order to get such trained help, Training School for Nurses has been continued during the nium. While it is true, not all that enter as pupil nurses un during the entire two years course, they all are very h benefited by the instructions given, and besides, they take leper interest in their work, and by reason of their special ling render more efficient work than those who travel from hospital to another seeking work. It has been our purpose and practice to obtain our pupil nurses, as far as possible, from the rural districts, and admit only those who possess the proper requirements of character and education. As might be expected, there is no little extra amount of work and worry connected with the proper management of a training school for nurses, but, when the results are taken into consideration, we feel that it is time well spent. I Under the Nebraska Public Library Commission, Miss ence Waugh, Librarian for State Institutions, installed a ry at our hospital during the early part of this year. About books were furnished the hospital by the Library Commis - and as Miss Waugh had given her personal attention in ting these books, we have the satisfaction in knowing that are all suitable for our patients, and we need have no fear any undue excitement will follow the reading of any of the [s. About a dozen of the leading magazines have also been ished by the Commission. It has been very gratifying to note the pleasure the reading of the books and magazines have given the patients. The ex- </seg>
            <seg id="p007">209 tant hours have been spent while reading these books, and ire looking forward with pleasure to the time when more books will be added to our popular library. t Religious services have been held at the hospital, Sunday moons at three o'clock. The different ministers of Norfolk nging to the ministerial association having taken turns in lucting the services. I We have also had special song service given by the' choir the Congregational Church. Last Christmas, Rev. Booth, the Congregational Church, gave a Stereoptican Lecture on 'Life of Christ," when some very beautiful pictures were wn, which were enjoyed very much by the patients. Rev. )th also gave on another occasion a Stereoptican Lecture itled, "A Trip Around the World." This lecture also gave patients much pleasure. A Moving Picture Show has been given on Tuesday evenings, and Dance on Friday evenings. For our moving picture show, having our own machine, we have rented three reels from a Film Service in Omaha at an expense of three dollars for each show. We have tried as far as possible to get such pictures that would amuse the patients, the more comic, the better, and never get any thing on the tragic order. Our moving picture shows have been the most popular, and therefore the best attended of any of our amusements. I In my judgment, there can be no form of amusement given ients at our state hospitals that will so please them, as well five them as much enjoyment at a very small expense as the perly conducted moving picture show. While it has been custom not to make it compulsory on the part of the patients attend the services and entertainments nearly all cf those *se mental condition would permit it have attended. Repairs and Improvements All of the rooms in the main building have been painted and decorated. The rooms on the first floor are used as office rooms for the superintendent, first and second physician, steward, stenographer and superintendent of nurses, and one large room is used as a reception room for visitors. The rooms on the other two floors are occupied by the officers as living rooms, dining - rooms and the kitchen. The outside woodwork of this building, </seg>
            <seg id="p008">210 LAND COMMISSIONER'S REPORT Prge porch, has been painted. All of the first floor e one, including the large day-room, a small dormi - jr's office, clothes room, toilet and bath room, have and the woodwork varnished. Most of the halls, he rooms on the three floors of the west wing, have the woodwork varnished and the floors repaired. I The old store-room building, now used as sleeping quarters the outside employees, and one of the oldest buildings on the itution grounds, was in very bad condition, as much mortar some bricks had fallen from the outer walls. These walls e all been pointed up with cement, and the entire building, uding the roof, given two coats of paint. The outside stair - f leading to the upper story, being decayed to such an extent t it was not safe to use it, was torn down, and a new stair It in its place. All the outer walls of the old kitchen building have been pointed up with cement and given two coats of paint. The roof of this building has also been painted. The lower floor of this building is used for the employees dining room, a small dining room for the kitchen help, the general kitchen and bakery. A steel ceiling has been put in the small dining room, the bakery and the room used as a store room for flour, and all of the above mentioned rooms have been given two coats of paint. The upper story of this building is used for a chapel and general amusement hall. This entire hall has been painted and decorated, the woodwork varnished, and the chairs repaired, as well as painted and varnished. The outer stairs leading up to the chapel, as well as the porch in front of the door, had decayed, so that it was not safe to walk upon. These structures were all removed, and new stairs, as well as porch, were built with substantial brick piers under as support. A very complete refrigerating plant and ice machine has been installed at an expense of $3,000. The laundry machinery has been rearranged, a new dry - room built, and new machinery installed at an expense of $2,500. A new floor has been laid in the ironing room, and a complete set of electric irons installed. </seg>
            <seg id="p009">211 new roof has been built over the pump room and general ir shop, and a steel ceiling put in these two rooms. I The entire floor in the boiler room has been replaced by a ivy cement floor, and the two pumps moved to a more suitable ce and reset. Three underfeed stokers have been installed an expense of $3,500. The walls of the old green house, being originally built of old brick taken from the building destroyed by fire, caved in, so that it was necessary to rebuild the entire green house. Cement blocks made by our patients were used in the rebuilding. A new glass front, as well as new doors were put in. All of the interior was reconstructed, so that we now have a much better green house than before. The new building for women patients, that had been under construction three years when we took charge of the hospital, has been finished by day labor, much of the work being done by patients. An appropriation of $6,000 was made by the last legislature for the finishing of this building. A new tunnel eighty feet long has been built, connecting the old tunnel with the new building. t During the biennium there have been approximately 10,000 re feet of cement side walk and flooring laid, and 2,800 square Df terrazzo floor. A large silo 18 by 34 feet for cattle feed has been built. The cow barn has been reshingled. The cattle and hog yards have been rearranged, and a new cattle shed has been built. The grounds have been beautified by planting a great number of evergreens, shrubbery, shade and ornamental trees. The farm has been managed very successfully, among other items thirty tons of sweet corn has been taken to the local canning factory, and canned for the hospital. The green stalks were cut up and put in the silo for cattle feed. Besides the hospital farm, comprising 320 acres, 160 acres have been rented and very suc - cessfully farmed; most of the work being done by the patients. The Osborn fruit farm, comprising forty acres, and located a half mile from the hospital, has been rented during the past two years at an annual rental of $200. During the first year we gathered 125 bushels of cherries; about 1,500 bushels of apples, besides much small fruit, such as strawberries, raspberries, currants, etc. The year just past was not a good year for fruit in this </seg>
            <seg id="p010">212 locality, and still, I am satisfied that we raised enough fruit to pay for the rent of the orchard. Aside from the value of the fruit gathered, I consider the renting of this orchard the most valuable investment made, as it has been a source of unspeakable pleasure to the patients to be permitted to spend much of their time in the orchard, gathering and eating fruit to their hearts content. IAs this orchard is now for sale, and can be bought at a very mable price, I would recommend that an appropriation of X) be made for that purpose. New improvements needed. We now have room for about fifteen female patients, but on the male wards every bed is oc - cupied, and, as there are sixty beds in one of the cottages, that was originally intended for but fifty, and one cottage having sixty - four beds, that according to the per capita allotting of 800 cubic feet of air space for each patient, should contain less than fifty beds, it can be readily seen that no more beds can be crowded I would recommend that the socalled west wing on the mens' side be extended 100 feet to the west, and an L made there. This will make the buildings on both sides of the ground symmetrical. A dining room could be built on the first floor of the L large enough to accommodate the number of patients that the new addition would hold, which I believe would be about eighty patients. I would recommend that $50,000 be appropriated by the next legislature for the purpose. The engine and dynamo we now have will do the work re - quired for our present wants, but, as we have' nothing to fall back on should something go wrong, and also anticipating that a new building will be provided, additional power and light must also be provided. I would recommend that an appropriation of $4,000 be made for a new engine, dynamo and switch board. k While more than the usual amount of repair work has been during the biennium, there is still much work to be done, as a liberal appropriation will be asked for, covering every of repair and improvements, it will not be necessary to specify item by itself. The appropriations made by the last legislature were suffi- </seg>
            <seg id="p011">213 deficiency in any of the funds, and we may have a surplus of $4,000 or $5,000 in the maintenance fund. â–  The per capita cost for the first year was $215,93, and for second year $198,3. t There are two reasons why the per capita cost for the second â–  was much lower than that for the first. One reason is, that ing the second year we had forty-three more patients than bad during the first year. The second reason is that during first year $2,500 was spent for laundry machinery and charged he maintenance fund, and thus the per capita cost was in - sed by about $8. tlf additional room is provided, as we have indicated in this rt, so that all of the patients that will be committed from territory can be received, we may confidently look forward greater decreased per capita expenditure during the next nium. t Acknowledgmentâ€” I take this means of extending to you, the members of the Board of Public Lands and Buildings, heartiest thanks for the interest taken in our work. Had it been for the fact that we were given full power to hire and harge all employees, as we found it necessary, we could not ! had the perfect harmony and co-ordinate work that we have t think I am perfectly safe in saying that our patients have better cared for, better fed and clothed during the past ium than ever before. also wish to extend my thanks and appreciation to the â– rs and employees for their loyalty and faithful work.
