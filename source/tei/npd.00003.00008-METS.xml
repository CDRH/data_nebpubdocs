APPROPRIATIONS. 

Although I am satisfied that the work of the office will be 
somewhat lighter than for some years past, owing to the fact 
that onr school lands are practically all under lease, and that 
forfeitures will not occur as often in the future, owing to the 
greater value and demand for these grazing lands, yet I believe 
the same amount of force can be used to an advantage to the 
state, and would only recommend that stenographer be inserted 
for "sale clerk," to correspond with the position and work actually 
performed, and a stenographer is indispensable to the 
work of the office. 

I have completed, during the past four years, much business 
deferred from former vears. and all the work of the office has </seg>


            <seg id="p007">7 


been carefully, thoroughly and promptly performed, as must be 
apparent when you realize that nearly all of the educational 
lands of the state have been leased, and are now a great source 
of revenue to the school fund of the state. 

The full items of postage, books, stationery, express and telegraph, 
office repairs. Board of Purchase and Supplies, and Board 
of Educational Lands and Funds are needed. As you will notice, 
nearly all of these funds are now exhausted, although I have 
used strict economy in all cases, purchasing articles only which 
were absolutely necessary, as will appear by bills filed with 
vouchers in the Auditor's office. 

It is the duty of the Commissioner of Public Lands and Buildings 
to furnish the county treasurers all books and stationery to 
conduct the school-land business in their respective counties. 
During my four years in office I have had a great many ledgers 
and abstracts made to replace those worn and unfit for use, aJid 
it is my impression that there will be many requests during the 
next two years for similar books, many of those now held by 
the county treasurers are very old and worn, being in use for a 
number of vears. 

I cannot too strongly urge the enforcement of the law in regard 
to forfeiture of all delinquent contracts, and as the law requires 
that services shall be given by registered letter, it will 
take considerable money for this work alone; therefore, I think 
the appropriation asked for is not too large. 

The expense of conducting the business of the department dur 

ing the past two years has been as follows 

Postage $1,104 00 

Books, stationery, and office supplies 1,180 00 

Express, telephone, and telegraph 245 52 

Serving notices of delinquency, advertising auctions 
for leasing canceled and vacant lands, and other 
expenses of the Board of Educational Lands and 
Funds 3,442 55

Outstanding claims for books, stationery, office supplies,

No fees are charged for services rendered in this department 
except for making certified copies of the government plats and 
field notes, of which 1 am made custodian by sections 5034 to 
5O.57, Compiled Statutes of 1S97. I found that it had been customary 
to charge for this service to avoid imposition, and have, 
therefore, charged for these certified copies the actual cost to 
the state for the time occupied in preparing the same. From 
this source I have received in cash f 173.48, which has been paid 
into the state treasury. I also reported in my former report four 
registered warrants of Cheyenne county in the aggregate sum 
of $34.90. Since my previous report two of these warrants 
have been paid, amounting to $19.70. which I also turned in to 
the state treasury, leaving in my hands warrant Nq. 74 for $6.90 
and No. 209 for $10, which I will turn over to my successor, and 
when paid should be paid into the treasury. While I find that 
it has been customary to charge for this work, I find no record 
of what became of the money so collected until my first term 
of office, which, with the present amount and without the unpaid 
warrants referred to, amounts to $321.45. 

I would recommend that the legislature amend the school 
land law designating the amount of fees which the Commissioner 
of Public Lands and Buildings should charge for making 
copies of the government plats and field notes, the fees so received 
to be paid into the state treasury and credited to the 
school land fund. 

I would also recommend that the legislature amend the school 
land law, designating the fees which the Commissioner of Public 
Lands and Buildings should charge for making certified copies 
of lo«t lease and sale contracts. During my term of office I have 

FEES. </seg>


            <seg id="p009">9 


made no charge for this work, finding no provision of law where 
I would be justified in making such a charge. 1 find, however, 
that this is quite an imposition on the office to make these certified 
copies without charge. The cases are numerous of persons 
claiming by carelessness of otherwise to have lost their contracts 
and asking for certified copies or duplicates, and when a proper 
showing is made we issue them, but they should pay the expense. 


PENITENTIARY LAND. 

Of the fifty sections of land granted by the Enabling Act for 
the erection of a penitentiary building there yet remains unsold 
and unclaimed for that purpose, six hundred and seventy-six 
and 71-100 (676.71) acres, described as follows: the 8, E. } of the 
S. W. I and the S. E. of section 26, township 8, range 5; the 
N. W. j of section 30, township 9, range 5; the E. £ of the N. E. 

i and the E. \ of the S. E. \ of section 34, township 9, range 4; 
and the N. W. \ of section 28, township 11, range 4, the management 
and disposition of which does not seem to be specifically 
provided for by law. Believing that this land properly came 
under the control of the Board of Public Lands and Buildings, I 
have leased it each year to the highest and best bidder, with the 
result that I have collected as rental therefor during this bienniniu 
$2,02«i.55 in cash, and now hold two notes for flOO each, 
payable December 1, 1901. 

In my former report I recommended that the legislature pass 
an act authorizing the State Treasurer to credit the money so 
far derived from this land, and that which may hereafter be derived 
therefrom, to the temporary school fund, and that the land 
be, by suitable enactment, made a part of the educational lands 
of the state, to be handled in the future the same as the common 
school land. I would make the same recommendation to 
the legislature of 190.1. </seg>

LAND COMMISSIONER'S REPORT. 

THE EDUCATIONAL LANDS. 

The educational lands of Nebraska, aggregating 2,969,102.sr&gt; 
acres, consist of saline, normal, university, agricultural college 
endowment, and common school land. 

The state came into possession of the saline lands by virtue 
of section 11 of the Enabling Act. Under this authority 45,594.-24 
acres were confirmed to the state. By legislative enactment 
a portion of this grant has been set aside for other purposes. ;is 
follows: 

Endowment for State Normal School 12.804.8(1 acres 

For the use of the Nebraska hospital for insane 

For the experimental farm 1,280.00 acres 

The remaining 30,490.40 acres of this grant is being held and 
used for the benefit of the permanent and temporary school fund, 
as shown in the table in reference to saline land. 

The normal endowment lands, aggregating 12,804.80 acres, 
were acquired by legislative enactment from the saline land 
grant. 

.- 

Under section 10 of the Enabling Act the state was grant 
45,426.8 acres for the support of the state university. 

The agricultural college endowment lands were acquired by 
an act of congress donating lands to the several states and tVrritories 
which may provide colleges for the benefit of agricultural 
and mechanical arts, approved July 2, 18&lt;i2. Under this 
grant 89,138.50 acres have been received. 

The common school lands were granted by section 7 of the 
Enabling Act. From this source the state has received to date 
2,791,243.07 acres. 

DISPOSAL OF THE FUNDS DERIVED FROM THE EDUCATIONAL 

LANDS OF THE STATE.

saline lands forms the permanent school fund. The interest on

the unpaid portion of the purchase contracts and the rental, 
interest and bonus on the lease contracts are credited to the 
7 
temporary school fund, which with the money coming to thin 
fund from other sources is apportioned to the common schools 
of the state twice a year. 

The principal received from the saJe of agricultural college 
endowment, university, and normal endowment lands forms the 
permanent fund for their respective institutions. 

The interest on the unpaid portion of the purchase contracts 
and the rental, the interest on delinquent rental payments and 
bonus on lease contracts form the temporary university and 
normal interest funds respectively, which is used for the current 
expenses of these institutions on the order of their officers. 
Each of these permanent funds remain forever inviolate and undimiuished, 
but may be invested in certain classes of securities. 

The unpaid portion of the purchase price on the sale contracts 
now in existence is |3,946,083.07. This may be paid within 
twenty years from the date of the contract, at the option of the 
purchaser.

LAND COMMISSIONER'S EEPOET. 

vestments for these permanent trust funds at as good, or nearly 
as good, a rate of interest as the sale contracts draw, I am still 
using every effort to induce owners of sale contracts, which are 
maturing, to take advantage of extending their maturity according 
to section 9, chapter 71, Laws of 1897, and the Board of 
Educational Lands and Funds have granted all such applications 
when the title to the contract and interest payments were 
ill good condition. Under this provision the Board of Educational 
Lands and Funds have extended, for ten years, the 
maturity of contracts covering 10,380 acres. 

While I would not recommend a reappraisement of all our 
school lands remaining unsold, yet I called attention in my last 
report to certain portions upon which leases had been issued 
prior to April 14, 1885, and the same were reappraised in 1889; 
but the appraisement was set aside by the supreme court as 
being repugnant to the provision for reappraisement stipulated 
in the contracts themselves. (See 31 Neb., page 139, State, ex 
rel. C. M. Brown, v. A. J. McPeak.) While all lands at that time 
appraised, and not affected by the above decision, are held, and 
being paid on at the new, and generally a much higher, appraisement, 
it seems to me that justice to the state and to those who 
have had the valuation of their lands raised would suggest that 
a reappraisement should be made of these lands conformatory to 
the above decision of the supreme court, and I would so recommend. 
The land which would be so affected by such reappraise 
ment is located in the following counties : 

Adams, Antelope, Boone, Buffalo, Burt, Colfax, Custer, Dawson, 
Fillmore, Franklin, Furnas, Gage, Hall, Harlan, Jefferson. 
Kearney, Knox, Lancaster, Lincoln, Madison, Nuckolls, Pawnee, 
Phelps, Platte, Sherman, Thayer, Valley, Wayne, Webster, and 
York. 

In my last biennial report I made a number of recommendations 
in regard to changes in our school land laws that experience 
had taught me were needed to make them more effective and just 

AI'PRAISAL UNDER OLD LEASE CONTRACTS </seg>


            <seg id="p013">11 

EDUCATIONAL LANDS. 

to the state and the individual holding or wishing to lease the 
same. These were embodied in a bill introduced by Senator 
Reynolds of Dawes county, and became the law by an almost 
unanimous vote and has proven effective even beyond by own' 
most sanguine expectations. 

RECOMMENDATION 

I think there is one further change desirable or perhaps I 
should say that the law should be made more definite upon one 
point. It is provided in the law that holders of sale contracts 
may surrender the same, or any part of the same, upon certain 
conditions, which I think is all right, but I think the interest 
of the state now requires that all surrendered school land contracts 
or forfeited leased lands be hereafter leased only at public 
auction, instead of being taken at the treasurer's office, as is 
claimed by some they may be as the law now stands. These 
lands are becoming more and more valuable and. therefore, more 
sought after; and when contracts are surrendered on account 

(if too high an appraisement, every citizen should have a right to 
compete for them in his own interest as well as that of the 
state. 1 would, therefore, recommend, that all educational lands 
of the state now vacant or to become vacant by surrender or 
forfeiture be first offered for lease by the Commissioner, or some 
one deputized by him, at the county treasurer's office after duly 
advertising. Any lands not so taken to be leased at treasurer's 
office on application at present appraisement. This should by 
all means be the law in surrendered contract lands, as it goes 
back to the old lease appraisement, which is generally much 
too low; but as practically all the land is now under lease and 
will be generally kept up, I would include all lands now vacant 
or to become so. 

Chapter 80, section 29, page 1070, Compiled Statutes of 1899, 
provides that "all property, real and personal, which may now 
belong to the state or that may hereafter escheat to the state for 

ESCHEATS </seg>


            <seg id="p014">12 

LAND COMMISSIONER'S REPORT. 

want of owners shall be managed by the Governor and Superintendent 
of Public Instruction, and such property and proceeds 
thereof shall be placed in the temporary school fund.'" 

I would recommend a change in the law placing the same 
under the management of the Commissioner of Public Lands 
and Buildings as being more in line with the work of his office. 
I would also recommend that escheated lands be made part and 
parcel of the school lands of the- state to be leased as other 
school lands. This is suggested by the state securing by act of 
the legislature of 1899. and under chapter 73, section 71, page 
922 of Compiled Statutes of 1899, certain lands in Cheyenne 
county belonging to the heirs of Robert W. Fawcus (see Session 
Laws of 1899. page 420 1 for which the state paid $&lt;i,(J:{&lt;). which 
investment so far has yielded no return, and in my opinion it 
will be a long time before any adequate return will be realized 
therefrom by the state. The appropriation recites that "at tintime 
of his (Fawcus") death he was the owner of about S00 acres 
of land in Cheyenne county, but the abstract filed in the case 
shows only &lt;&gt;40 acres. The petition, in addition to describing the 
land mentioned in the abstract, says that the "said Robert W. 
Fawcus. at the time of his death, also held certain lease interests 

in the following described educational lauds of the state of 
Nebraska, to-wit: the S. E. \ of sec. 1&lt;». T. 20 N., of R. 52 west, 
while the records of this office show other parties to be holding 
this land. So it is evident that all the state gets for its $&lt;».&lt;&gt;:?() 
is the following: W. \ X. W. \, all of S. \V. ), the S. E. J X. W. 
i, the W. i 8. E. \, the S. E. } S. E. J, and the S. W. &gt; X. E. | 
sec. 24, T. 20 X., R. 52 west; also W. £ X. W. \ and X. E. } X. W. 
i and W. 1 S. \Y. } in sec. 25, T. 20. R. 52 west, all in Cheyenne 
countv. 

While I earnestly suggest the foregoing changes as long as 
the law of escheated lands remains as it now is. yet I think 
the law itself should be carefully revised and amended, if not 
repealed, as in the procedure against aliens for the purpos? of 
forfeiture the state is required to pay all expense and is liable 
to pay for the land a great deal more than it is worth. </seg>

BOARD OF PUBLIC LANDS AND BUILDINGS. 

BOARD OF PUBLIC LANDS AND BUILDINGS 

While it has been customary for the Commissioner, in his 
biennial report to the Governor, to review all of the public 
institutions in the state, yet, finding neither law nor necessity 
for the same, as the head of each institution is required to make 

such report to your excellency, I shall omit such reference in 
my report, except, as chairman of the Board of Public Lands 
and Buildings, I deem it proper to render an accounting to the 

legislature, through you, of the various appropriations made 
at the last session for additions and improvements to several of 
our state institutions. 

The legislature of 1899 made an appropriation of |40,000 for 
the purpose of erecting for the Nebraska Hospital for the Insane 
at Lincoln, Neb., one fire-proof wing, and providing the same 
with heating equipment. After duly advertising for bids the 
Board, on October 12, 1899, met and, after considering all the 

idopted the hollow-tiled fire-proofing and accepted the bid 

if Arthur &amp; II u I'd, amounting to $33,353. This being the lowest 
bid for that kind of fire-proofing. They also accepted the bid of 
The Korsmeyer Plumbing Company, amounting to $4,960, this 
being the lowest bid submitted for these items. Total for completing 
the building as per specifications, |38,313. - W. B. Hester, 
of Normal, was appointed superintendent of construction. This 
building is not yet completed, but is nearing completion, and 
when done, we think, will be a credit to the state and will greatly 

relieve the Norfolk Asylum, as well as the older part of the one 
on the same grounds, of their overcrowded condition, and will 
enable the state to take care of many who are being otherwise 
provided for. for lack of room. 

It seemed necessary to the Board that the Home for the 
Friendless should have an artificial stone walk; therefore they 
asked for bids, and on April 9, 1900, the Board met and awarded 
the contract to K. B. Graham for 14Jc per square foot, which 
amounted to $367.64, and which has been completed in a very 
satisfactory manner.

The- Board became convinced that it was necessary to have a 
new well for the Nebraska Hospital for the Insane at Lincoln, 
and met and awarded the contract, on June 3, 1890, to ("has. 
Burns. The work completed cost ?4,425, and is affording an 
excellent supply of fresh water. 

By House Roll No. 275, Session Laws of 1899, there was ap 
propriated $7,700 for the erection of a brick and stone boiler 
house for the Institute for the l&gt;eaf and Dumb at Omaha, which 
was to be equipped with four boilers for heating purposes of s;iid 
institution. After advertising for bids the Board, on May -'¦'&gt;. 

1899, met and awarded the contract to (Jeo. W. Blake for #»&gt;.491 
who completed the work quite satisfactorily. 

By House Roll No. 9, Session Laws of 1899, there was appropriated 
the sum of flo.OOO for the erection of a boiler and 
engine house, cold storage room, new well and air lift pump 
for the Hospital for the Chronic Insane at Hastings. After 
advertising for bids the Board met on July 21, 1899, and awarded 
the contract for the erection of the boiler and engine house to 

Butzirus &amp; Klose, of Hastings, for #7.4:?."). On January 22. 1900. 
after duly advertising for bids for the erection of the cold 
storage plant, the Board met and awarded the contract to Fred 
W. Wolfe &amp; Co., of Chicago, for $5,40li, this being the lowest 
bid submitted for this work. Both of these contracts were fully 
carried out to the entire satisfaction of the Board, mainly under 
the direction and supervision of Dr. J. T. Steele. superintendent 
of the institution, to whom great credit is due for its completeness 
in every detail. We point with special pride to the expenditure 
of these two appropriations. 

House Roll No. 280. Session Laws of 1899, appropriated *-•". 
000 for the purpose of erecting a three-story brick and stone 
building for the use of the Institute for the Deaf and Dumb at 
Omaha. After duly advertising for bids the Board met on 
August 5, 1899, and opened the following bids: Hamilton Bros." 
bid was f 18,087; being the lowest bidders, the contract for the 
building, exclusive of the electric wiring, steam heating, and 
plumbing, was let to them. Balfe &amp; Reed, of Omaha, bid |2,!Hh, </seg>


            <seg id="p023">23 

BOARD OF PUBLIC LANDS AND BUILDINGS. 

and this being the lowest bid, the contract for the plumbing and 
steam heating was let to them. At a meeting of the Board 

August !». 1899, $800 was added to the contract price of Balfe &amp; 
Reed for plumbing and steam fitting, for extra pipes, reducing 
valves, and other extras. Also there was added to the bid of 
Hamilton Bros. $71:?, for extra slate blackboard, moulding and 

chalk trough, not included in former specifications. Frederick 
Delone, of Omaha, was employed as superintendent of construction 
at a salary of $4 per day for the time actually employed. 
These several contracts were all carried out by the respective 
parties and to the entire satisfaction of the Board, and the 
building is now elegantly furnished and in use and will bear the 

scrutiny, and is an ornament to the state and a credit 

to all concerned in its design and construction. Much credit is 
due the architect. Henry Voss, the contractors, and the superintendent 
of construction, as well as the superintendent of the institution, 
in their respective capacities. 

There was appropriated by the legislature of 1899 $5,000, for 

m of a hospital building at the Soldiers' and Sailors' 

Milford. After duly advertising for bids the Board 

Hon 

met on September Hi, 1899, and 
AY. Blake &amp; Co.. for $3,880, and 
for plumbing and steam heating, 

awarded the contract to Geo. 
L. W. Pomerene the contract 
for $1,035. 

There was also appropriated by 
rection of a hospital building 

the legislature $12,500 for the 
at the Soldiers' and Sailors' 
advertising for bids the Board 

Home at Grand Island, and aftet 

met on September 12. 1899, and opened the following bids for 
the erection: Geo. W. Blake &amp; Co., $8,836; E. A. Stevens, $8,762. 
with an addition of floO for Colorado stone, if used. Mr. Blake's 
bid being made on Colorado stone, was accepted as the best bid. 
For the plumbing and steam heating the bid of L. YV. Pomerene 
&amp; Co., being the lowest according to specifications, it was accepted. 
The Board had some trouble over these two contracts 
with Blake &amp; Co., but finally secured the finishing of the building 
at Milford in a tolerably satisfactory manner, but had to call 
upon the Bond Company to finish the hospital at Grand Island </seg>


            <seg id="p024">24 

LAND COMMISSIONER'S REPORT. 

which, to its credit, be it said, they finished to the satisfaction 
of the Board and at an expense to itself of several thousand 
dollars. They were bonded by The American Bonding &amp; Trust 
Company, of Baltimore. Maryland. 

For the |48,500 appropriated by House Holl No. :M6, for the 
erection of certain buildings and their furnishings, and for 
various other purposes enumerated in the bill to be expended 
at the Feeble Minded Institute at Beatrice, the Board, after 
duly advertising, let a contract to C. F. Barras, of Lincoln, September 
30, 181W, for a boys' cottage in all respects complete for 
the sum of |16,250, which was completed under the supervision 
of E. C. McClellan, of Hastings, according to plans and specifi 
cations adopted by the Board and furnished by G. F. Schaffer, 
of Lincoln. On October 17. 1899, contracts were let to Geo. A. 
Schaul. after advertising for same, for an industrial building, 
also a hospital building, at the same institution, both of which 
have been completed in a very satisfactory manner under the 
same Superintendent McClellan and according to plans furnished 
by K. \Y. Grant, of Beatrice. The other appropriations 
in this bill were expended either in whole or in part for the 
various purposes specified, and we think the state, in cadi case. 
has received an equivalent for all expenditures under this appropriation 
and submit the work in proof. 

House Roll No. 8, making an appropriation of $30,000 for a 
fire-proof wing to the Hastings Asylum, was so worded and 
elaborated as to details that, after two efforts by advertising 
for plans and specifications and bids, the Board could get no 
bid for its completion so as to conform to the requirements of 
the bill making the appropriation within that amount. In fact 
the lowest bid to complete such a building was about $8,000 
more than the amount appropriated, while the bill provided 
"that in no case shall any bid in excess of the sum specified be 
accepted by the Board." This failure to appropriate enough 
money to complete the desired and described building was 
largely due to the advance in price of all building material and 
labor and especially fire-proof material. This building is much </seg>

needed and in fact js indispensable, and the Board hopes that a 
sufficient amount will be appropriated, by the coming legislature, 
for its construction. 

Mr. J. E. Crane was appointed, by the Board, engineer at the 

capitol building four years ago, and in addition to his work as 
such has been of great service to the state in other lines. As an 

expert he has visited, at the request of the Board, almost all 
the state institutions and made reports on the condition of the 
boilers and the entire plants, and has drawn plans and made 
specifications for numerous changes and improvements that, if 
done by one specially employed for the purpose, would have 
cost the state several hundred dollars; but the Board found Mr. 
&lt; 'i-iinc very competent in this line, as well as an engineer, and 

he lias cheerfully rendered this extra service, for which the 
Board wishes to thank him. and to suggest a more substantial 

ward when the legislature is considering claims for valuable 

vices rendered. 

SOME THANKS. 

As chairman of the Board of Public Lands and Buildings I 
wish to express my thanks to the other members of the Board 
for the uniform and always courteous treatment that I have received 
at their hands. I assure them, each and all, that I appre- 

ciate it very highly, and that our four years of association and 
labor together will always be a pleasant memory to me in the 
years to come. 

To my office force, whether as now constituted, or at any other 
period of my incumbency, I owe much, and I hereby extend my 
expression of warmest appreciation of all their many kindnesses 
since their adoption into my official family. No father could ask 

of his own children greater respect and consideration than I 
have received from them, and no employer should ask of his 
employees better service than they have rendered the state, 
and whatever credit may be found due to my administration I 
am willing to have credited to them a liberal share. 

I am especially indebted to Mr. E. W. Nelson and Mr. D. D. 
Lynch for their faithful and laborious services as deputies. Mr. </seg>


            <seg id="p026">26 

LAND COMMISSIONER'S REPORT. 

Nelson, having served all of my first and about half of my second 
term, was promoted to the supreme court department, and I 
promoted Mr. Lynch from book-keeper to deputy, who has more 
than fulfilled my highest expectations. The future footsteps 
of all who have been associated with me in my office will, as 
far as possible, be watched by me, and I shall rejoice at every 
upward step they may be able to take. 

To yourself as Governor, and to all the state officers, heads of 
institutions, and employees. I gratefully acknowledge my indebtedness 
for many kind words and acts. I am fully satisfied with 
my own work and submit it to a candid constituency for their 
commendation or condemnation. </seg>
