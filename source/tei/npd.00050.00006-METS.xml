            <seg id="p023">24 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION WEDNESDAY MORNING SESSION January 5, 1921 The Thirty-Sixth Annual Convention of the Nebraska Dairymen's Association met in the Dairy Building of the University Farm, Lincoln, and was called to order by the President, Dr. H. A. Morrison, of College View, Wednesday morning, January 5, immediately following the adjourn - ment of the Crop Growers' Association. THE PRESIDENT: I am glad indeed we can have with us this morning a man to welcome us who has been upon these grounds for the past twenty-two years, and who has seen this plant — not simply the dairy plant, but the entire group of farm buildings — grow up in this place. He has had to do in a very special way with the development of the Agricul - tural College, and has been its Dean since its organization in 1909. I am pleased to introduce to you this morning our own Dean Burnett. (Ap - plause.) ADDRESS OF WELCOME Dean E. A. Burnett, Lincoln, Nebraska Gentlemen: I am sorry our session was delayed, but I am sure that every members of the Dairy Association has been vitally interested in the problems which were discussed here during this morning, and that seemed a sufficient reason for not dividing our number in the first ses - sion, but permitting everyone to take advantage of the report which was being made here on market conditions, and hear the interesting ad - dresses. I think perhaps at no time in the last six years, at least, has the dairy problem been so much in the minds of the people of Nebraska as it is at the present time. All of us know that in the extremely prosper - ous times when it is easy to get money from any sort of farming, and when it is extremely difficult to secure labor with which to carry on an intensive line of industry, those intensive industries are likely to be curbed a little in their development. But in a time like this when it is extremely difficult to realize on our labors, we find the dairy industry begins to look up and tends, more than ordinary lines of work, to develop under such conditions as these. I do not think we need to be ashamed even at the progress we have made in the last six years in competition with lines of grain farming which have been extremely prosperous. We have been growing steadily and continuously. We have developed a dairy organization. We have very greatly increased the number and quality of the dairy cattle in the State; and probably now, starting this year, we will find that our in - crease will be greater than it has been in the past, due to the tact that the realizing of prices on other lines of Industry Is more difficult. There has never been in the history of this State a time of financial •tringency when Intensive Industries like the dairy industry have not </seg>
            <seg id="p024">THIRTY-SIXTH ANNUAL CONVENTION 25 made progress faster than lines of general farming. I think we are to experience that sort of a period just now. Looking over the history of the dairy industry in these last few years, I think the Farm Bureau Association, with its county agents in the various states, has helped to develop this industry wherever those farm bureaus take up the problem of milt: production and the growth of dairy cattle. I know in Gage county five years ago when the Farm Bureau Association took up this matter, they gave it an impetus which it never had had before that, and carried it on steadily through these years of high prices until Gage county today has probably eight or ten times as many pure bred live stock as seven years ago. I know in Seward county where the dairy industry was taken up by the Farm Bureau organization, the same conditions obtain. Within the last few weeks the irrigated section in Scotts Bluff county has organized to introduce dairy cows into that section. Because of the farm conditions they have not these intensely cultivated farms. With large quantities of alfalfa available, this industry is necessary in order to increase the acre production of that land, and by the same process to Increase the profits per acre from the individual farm unit. Several activities are going on which I think are tending to increase the yield for the individual cow — the average yield per cow in the State. This is one of the essential things in connection with the development of the dairy business. The cow-testing associations which have been or - ganized — some of which are in operation — have all gone to show the ex - treme necessity of weeding out the poor animals and selecting those which are the most profitable, and building up a herd of high-producing animals. We have been doing that here at the Farm for a long time. We have continually increased the average production of the herd. I cannot tell you wiiat its average production has been the past year, but for the pre - ceding year ending January, 1920, our production was 470 pounds per cow. This is something like three times the average production of the average herd in the State, and goes to show how greatly it is possible for us to develop production in an individual herd, once we give it our attention and secure the best assistance and advice available upon such subjects. I suppose you will all be interested in a cow which has finished her annual test at the Farm.' You have seen her frequently during the year, and I suppose are already advised of the fact we have just completed a test on the Farm of 1,310 pounds of butter from an individual cow and 29,555 pounds of milk, in one year. Those are extreme cases which the Individual dairyman cannot meet. Yet I am confident by breeding and ■election he can double the production of hi* herd in tram five to tea yean. </seg>
            <seg id="p025">NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION 26 Now the dairy industry is increasingly important, as we find market for our milk in the larger cities, the ice cream market increases, and the demand for dairy products increases throughout the country. One evidence of the fact that the market is not yet supplied with as good a quality of the product as the public will consume, I think could be given in the illustration of the products which are sold at the Uni - versity Farm. In giving this illustration, I do not want you to get the idea that the purpose of our Dairy Department here is mainly to market dairy products. Our purpose is entirely something else. But incident - ally, we do sell dairy products over the counter in this building, not dis - tributing at all. We have a larger market for these dairy products — people coming to the Farm to purchase them — than we can supply. We buy a good deal of the milk that is used for churning and laboratory pur - poses. The purpose of the Department is really to educate young men and women to better dairy methods; to give them a knowledge of what it is best to do out upon these farms, and to inspire them with a little confidence and a determination to go back onto these farms and develop the dairy industry and the other agricultural industries on our Nebraska farms. The fact we have developed our herds here is incidental to this gen - eral purpose of education. We could not possibly carry on lines of edu - cation which are developed here without having good dairy herds. We could not give the instruction which is necessary in milk production and in the manufacture of cheese and ice cream and these by-products of the dairy without the laboratory facilities with which to work. We feel here that we ought to be congratulated and you ought to be congratulated on having ereced a dairy building which is so well suited to the -development of the industry. In conclusion, I only want to say you know you are always welcome here at this institution. We feel that we like to have the farmers come and see what is being done in all lines of agricultural education, and along lines of research, not only in dairy work, but all agricultural lines, we like to have every farmer feel it is his institution; that he helps to pay the bill. It is carried on by the process of taxation, and can only de - velop as the people of the State want it to develop and are willing to pay the costs. • If at any time it is going off in directions you think are not advis - able, we want you to come and say so frankly, and help us to start it up along the lines which you feel will be most useful to the farmers of the State. We want you to come often. We hope you will have a good time during this week. We hope you will stay through to the end, because these programs continue until Fri - day night. Mr. Chairman, we trust you will always meet with us when - ever your interests so indicate, and the oftener you come and the more people you bring, the happier we are In the growth of the Association. (Applause.) </seg>
            <seg id="p026">27 THIRTY-SIXTH ANNUAL CONVENTION RE8PON8E President H. A. Morrison, College View. I should like to say in my response to Dean Burnett's splendid wel - come — which will have to consist of about twenty words instead of that many minutes — that we greatly appreciate the message he has brought to us. I am sure every dairyman can leave this place after he has listened to the program of today and tomorrow, and go home to the farm and to the cow with a new inspiration for the conduct of his business, and doubtless with some new motives. The dairy cow will milk easier after this meeting together, and so we are glad to be welcomed to this most splendid place for dairymen to meet, as he has welcomed us. INCREASING PROFIT TO THE DAIRY FARMERS BY MORE SYSTEM AND UNITED EFFORT John A. Luithly, Department of Dairy Husbandry, University of Nebraska, Lincoln Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen: Some time ago a member of the Program Committee asked me to p'repare a paper to be presented at this time, giving me the subject of Profits, and wishing me to treat it in such a way I might be able to tell how more profits might be derived to the farmer by better methods of handling and marketing. In order that I might not consume too much time, and present these facts in as logical way as I could, I have written what I wish to present. The subject of increasing profits by better methods of handling and marketing of the product of the dairy cow is a broad one. In fact it is too broad to be even satisfactorily outlined in a short presentation of this kind. If sufficient time were alloted to this discussion it would be impossible to discuss thoroughly any of its different phases because of lack of data pertaining to the present methods of producing and handling of dairy products. Such data is both time-consuming and expensive to collect. With all of it at hand it would not offer an entirely satisfactory solution to all concerned, but would in the majority of cases point out the defects and shortcomings of the present methods employed. It would be folly to think that the facts herein presented would quickly change the methods' now in vogue, but it is hoped that these few ideas set forth will stimulate more thinking in producing, handling and marketing the product of the dairy cow in order that more profit may be derived, for profit is essential in the upbuilding of any industry. It is a well known fact that dairying has been and is still a "close game." At least there is no case on record wherein the dairyman has 1 been offi - cially accused of being a profiteer. Yet he produces the most essential of all food products and by so doing works seven days of the week and three hundred and sixty-five days of the year. It is therefore only reason - able to gay that he should receive a fair profit. </seg>
            <seg id="p027">28 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION On the other hand, it is hoped that there may be stimulated a better spirit of co-operation not only among producers but also between pro - ducers and distributers or manufacturers, for without co-operation of both, unified and systematized methods 1 cannot be speedily attained. Especially is this true in the efficient handling of the milk supply of the larger cities. Here co-operation would give much better results than does too much competition. In order that we may have at least a general but at the same time a practical understanding of Nebraska conditions, it will be necessary to classify the dairy farmer with regard to the disposition of his product. The following classification covers quite thoroughly conditions for the state. 1. Those selling butter. 2. Those selling sour cream. a. Marketing through local cream buyer b. Marketing by shipping direct to the manufacturer. 3. Those selling sweet cream to ice cream plants. 4. Those selling whole milk direct to consumer. 5. Those selling whole milk to milk dealer. 6. Those selling whole milk to condenseries and cheese factories. Just what percentage of the whole on a cow basis each class makes up it is impossible to state. There is no doubt, however, that those who sell sour cream are the majority of Nebraska's dairy farmers, who pos - sess by far the largest number of milk-giving cows, while those who sell whole milk directly and indirectly rank second in dairy cattle. Those who sell dairy butter might be 'classed as the unfortunate few, because In a large number of Instances they are not easily accessible to a good market for either milk or cream. The man who markets his cream when it is still sweet usually obtains fifteen to twenty cents a pound of butter fat more than when he sells the same sour. The patrons of condensates and cheese factories are few as there are only two condenseries and one and a half cheese factories in the state. The making of dairy butter is perhaps due to several circumstances'. Most farmers make enough butter for their own use and at certain times have a surplus to sell which goes to the local merchant in exchange for groceries. Others who keep only a few cows are compelled to make and sell butter in a similar way. The grocer being not a judge of butter and having better judgment than to express his opinion on its quality, ac - cepts it at a comparatively low price. Much of the product thus secured goes to the, renovating factories at a still lower figure, where it is re - made and shipped east and sold as renovated butter among the laboring classes. There are a select few who make dairy butter from choice and because of its superior quality obtain a comparatively high price for It. They do not sell it to the grocer but have their own special customers whom they supply twice each week. When dairy butter thus marketed brings three to five cents a pound more than the retail price of creamery </seg>
            <seg id="p028">THIRTY-SIXTH ANNUAL CONVENTION 29 ■' \ butter it will yield a reasonable profit for the extra effort of making and delivering. Marketing Sweet' Cream There are few towns today of any size that do not have one or more ice cream factories which during at least six months of the year would require for the manufacture of ice cream, a considerable quantity of sweet cream, if it could be obtained. But the trouble has been that not enough of our farmers who milk do as a rule produce enough sweet cream to allow them to take advantage of such a market which will pay on the average from fifteen cents to twenty cents' a pound butter fat more than is paid for the same cream when sour. As a result the ice cream manu - facturer has to make his product from unsalted butter, dried milk and water by the process known as emulsification. The remade cream re - sulting from the process is quite satisfactory and makes a uniform quality of ice cream. Because of the invention of the homogenizer and emulsifler which are machines that turn back butter and dried milk, when mixed in the proper proportions with water and heated, into cream, it is becoming more and more difficult to find a sweet cream market at the ice cream plant. However, there are many who still appreciate the superior quality of sweet cream in the manufacture of ice cream and to whom price is of little consequence if both quantity and quality can be had at the proper time. It is only reasonable to believe that if the producer continues to neglect such an important market the time is not far distant when it will cease to exist. Marketing Sour Cream There are at the present time in the state nearly two thousand cream buying station. Recently the number has decreased, although it is constantly changing and each year finds a number of new ones opening and others closing. The system for the most part gives evi - dence that it has and still is performing an invaluable service to the producer by giving him a convenient and ready cash market for his product. In addition it should be said that these agencies, when repre - sented by our honest and unselfish creamery companies, have stimulated and encouraged dairying where it might not have otherwise developed. The farmer with only a few pounds of cream at first soon produced more and the people of the immediate country surrounding the cream station took to dairying as a side line. In contrast with these ad - vantages the practice has its evils. It is common to find at least four cream stations in many of our smaller towns and in one instance the number runs as high as seven. To the average person who does not give the matter serious thought, this 1 condition might appear to be an asset, for it has been said that "Competition is the life of trade." However it is a well known fact that competition is beneficial only when it increases the value of commodities by developing efficiency and fair play in a competitive field. When it reaches a point where efficiency </seg>
            <seg id="p029">NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION 30 cannot be attained and where fair play in some cases is questionable, then it becomes destructive. Two agencies in any one place should furnish the necessary competition to maintain at all times the highest prices. It would give to either or both a large volume of business so that the place of business would be a real service station for the farmer and one to which he could point with a satisfied pride and say to an in - quiring stranger "There is where I sell my cream and eggs and poultry." With very few exceptions such an assertion cannot be honestly made today. The question then arises, How can the thinning out be accomplished? It is not to be assumed that the problem is 1 a simple one to solve, but it is conscientiously believed that the organized efforts of the farmers, if properly directed, would contribute the largest force or factor toward a proper solution. Let us then examine the conditions that now exist. There are few producers of cream today who have either the knowledge or necessary equipment for determining the amount of butter fat in the goods they offer for sale. For that value they are wholly at the mercy of the buyer. When the cream tests high the dairyman is well satisfied, but if the percentage of fat is somewhat lower than It previously was he is apt to be dissatisfied and mistrustful, re - sulting in his taking the next can to another agent. And so he goes the rounds changing from one to another with quite marked regularity — a circumstance which explains why too many buyers do exist in not a few localities where production is only mediocre. If the proper facts were at hand, efficiency and economy would not be so difficult to establish. No one is more entitled to or in a better position to obtain that information than the man who produces. When he has a can of cream to sell he ought to know its value in dollars and cents. By weighing and carefully testing, that information is his. The seller is then on an equal basis with the buyer. The apparatus for the proper testing of milk and cream for butterfat costs about forty dollars. It is an essential part of the farm equipment and should therefore be considered a good investment. If every pro - ducer knew the accurate test of every lot of cream sold, he would not be long in selecting the honest buyer. A more unified and concentrated system would result bringing more profits to the farmer and the manu - facturer. Marketing Milk The problem of supplying the smaller towns and villages with milk is comparatively simple as the producer can retail direct. Here for the most part expensive buildings and equipment are unnecessary. The owner and his family do the work all of which reduces quite materially handling and delivery costs. But when the larger cities are considered the distance between the producer and consumer lengthens, making </seg>
            <seg id="p030">THIRTY-SIXTH ANNUAL CONVENTION 31 it very essential that there be an efficient middle man to take the milk from the more distant producers and distribute it. It has been said by a noted authority that "The middleman has been looked upon by some as an 'unmitigated evil,' because he places himself at the gates through which necessaries must pass on their way from pro - ducer to consumer and insists upon taking his toll of all that passes. As a matter of fact the middleman perform a function as necessary and as truly a service as production itself. Indeed he does actually produce when he adds value to a commodity by placing it at the customers door at the moment when wanted and in quantities desired." Especially is this true of the milk dealer for he handles a highly perish - able food product that must be sold before it leaves the farm and consumed within fourty-eight hours after it is produced. Every large city already has too many milk distributors. The same equipment now in use could be managed to handle twice its present volume with but little added cost. Most dealers are acquainted with this condition but are unable to bring about a consolidation that would seem to be satisfactory in the end to all concerned. Most of them strive continually to improve and progress, keeping in mind not only their own welfare but also that of the producer and consumer. Those who have no regard for either, and less for the former than the latter, have encouraged the establishment of co-operative plants by producers as a last resort. It is quite generally understood even by manufacturers and middlemen that the Midwest Milk plant in Omaha is operated with the object of eliminating an injustice. It is hoped and believed that they will succeed in spite of all obstacles, in order that justice will prevail. For sometime to come one more equipped factor is added as a protest against a selfish motive. This however adds another competitor who duplicates handling and delivering. It has been shown by Hibbard and Erdman that a unified system in distributing milk would effect a considerable saving. If a method was so regulated by public authority whereby each milk wagon had a door to door route and its own alloted section of the city, one man could easily deliver 570 quart points of milk, in a period of six hours. This would reduce the cost of milk by one-eighth — nearly two cents a quart — as compared to the present method where the same streets are traversed by as many as eight different distributors. In considering efficiency in the dairy business the question might well be raised with the dairy farmer, How much does your herd produce? If he keeps records the question is easy to answer, but if he does not there is no accurate way of telling. Neither can he intelligently weed out the star boarders from the herd without the use of the scales and the Babcoek test. There has been much data collected on the cost of producing milk. It is quite apparent that the price of milk cannot be set by the average costs in any locality, for the production of milk illustrates particularly well the widely varying costs of goods produced </seg>
            <seg id="p031">32 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION by different men. The law of supply and demand will always continue to exert their force and largely determine the price. Whenever the supply is low the price will be higher because the demand is greater in proportion, and when: the supply is great the de - mand will be proportionately less and the price lower. Therefore by controlling the supply so that it is always constant the price will be constant. Producers' associations no longer encourage milk strikes, but are attempting to control the supply going into the markets by di - recting its shipment, diverting the surplus to creameries, cheese fac - tories or condenseries instead of allowing it to glut the city market as formerly. These organizations through their able representatives can keep in as close touch with market conditions as the dealers them - selves. It should not be overlooked that a thoroughly unified organiza - tion will outlive its usefulness when it becomes unreasonable in its demands. Too high a price will decrease consumption. It will also cause their market to be flooded by the more distant producers. With the falling of prices every producer, dealer and manufacturer should be and is much concerned with the reducing of costs. Those who keep accurate accounts know where the leaks are occurring and continually apply the solder with unerring certainty. The fellow who continues to market his cream without knowing its value prevents honest and normal competition from taking its course in driving out the unreliables and concentrating upon the reliables. Keeping in mind that the present system in vogue in Nebraska have stood the test of time they must be nearly correct for her conditions. By properly unifying them they will continue to function more efficiently, for in unity there is strength. There is still another thought that occurs. Nebraska Is the home of the centralizing creamery Industry, an industry that is among the most heavily financed of our nation. The product — butter — is sold on the basis of quality, the higher the quality the higher the price and vice versa. The raw material — cream — from which it is made determines the quality of the finished article. The care exercised in the produc - tion and handling at the farm is the important factor in determining quality. The higher the quality, the larger will be the returns. There always has been a difference in the quality of cream produced by differ - ent farmers. A system of grading whereby the inferior will be separated from the good and payment made accordingly, is bound to come. It is the only logical way to instil more vigilence in producing and handling. Among some the idea is prevalent that old stale cream nets them as much as a clean fresh product, hence they exercise but little caution in caring for it. The farmers owe to themselves, the dairy industry in general, and the creamery industry in particular, a high quality of raw material, because it will return to them a greater profit, increase consumption, </seg>

MEMBER: I should like to know the relative advantage of market - ing the whole milk, or separating and selling the cream, in country places where we do not have access to city markets? PROFESSOR LUITHLY: That will depend upon local market con - ditions. MEMBER: Say we get fifty cents for cream: what price would we have to get for whole milk so that there would be an advantage in selling it? PROFESSOR LUITHLY: The price is usually enough to pay for the cost of marketing and delivery. MEMBER: I know a farmer who claims he got $3.00 a hundred for whole milk when he could have had 65 cents for cream. He said he was getting ten cents more for milk than by selling the cream. PROFESSOR LUITHLY: It would be easily figured on a fat basis, if you knew the percentage ol) fat in it, and what skim milk is worth for feeding purposes. If you were making cottage cheese you would probably make more in that way, but your marketing cost would be higher. MEMBER: How much cream will the average gallon of milk make? PROFESSOR LUITHLY: In 8.6 pounds of 4 per cent cream, there would be .36 to the pound butter fat. MEMBER: Wouldn't .30 of a pound give the average? That would take three gallons of milk to make a pound of butter fat. Then he was correct. PROFESSOR LUITHLY: You must take into consideration what the skim milk is worth. MEMBER: The question is if it is worth ten cents a gallon? PROFESSOR LUITHLY: If it is fed to pure bred stock, they con - cede it is worth 75 cents a hundred. If made into cottage cheese, it would be worth more. MEMBER: What is the cheapest and best way to get milk from a cow — by hand or machine? PROFESSOR LUITHLY: If you have plenty of help of your own, and that help is not busy at the time of year when your cows are producing a lot of milk, it would probably be cheaper to do it by hand. If difficult to obtain labor, it probably would be cheaper to do it by machines. PROFESSOR J. H. FRANDSEN, Lincoln: The Michigan Experi - ment Station has carried out experiments milking by hand and ma - chines. They found if the herd is large enough, you could milk by machines with one-third less labor than the other way. </seg>
            <seg id="p033">34 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION Last year I sent out a questionnaire to a number of Nebraska people using machines, and that is about the average results we get. Remember it depends on the size of your herd. The time it takes to clean the machines is just as much for a small herd as a large one, so these figures are all based on the herd's being large enough — twenty or more cows. REPORT OF THE SECRETARY-TREASURER Mr. J. E. Palm, Lincoln, Nebraska Mr. President, and Members of the Nebraska Dairymen's Associa - tion: I take pleasure in submitting my annual report, to which is 1 ap - pended a detailed list of receipts and expenditures. During the past year, we have put forth our efforts in creating a demand for milk and other dairy products by educating the consumers as to their value. A great many people consider milk just! a drink, or to use as cream in coffee, not realizing that it has 1 great food value; in fact, it is the greatest food, for the reason that there is no other food known to science that can take the place of milk. But the past year has seen a great awakening in this respect. The schools in the larger cities, as well as in the smaller towns, are teaching its food value, and giving milk to undernourished children, which is proving a great success. You know that the more milk that is consumed, the greater will be the demand; and the greater the demand, the higher the price. Consequently the milk producer has realized more for his milk this year that ever before. We distributed two thousand posters like the large ones you see hanging here in this room, many of them going to the public schools not only in Lincoln, but over the State. We have a greater demand for them than we can supply, so we feel that we have started a good cam - paign for the use of more milk. I should like to have each member of this Association consider himself a committee of one to see that his neighbors, as well as himself, use butter, and not any of the so-called substitutes; for there are no substitutes for milk and butter. In this way he can be of benefit to every dairy man. The manufacturers of the various margarines are spending millions of dollars to put their products before the people, and we must concede that they are having success. But if every one of you will start a campaign to use only butter, you will be surprised what an edu - cational effect it will have, as well as adding dollars to your own coffers. Our activities at the State Pair this past year were greater than in previous years. We had a good display, and the booths and kitchen where the milk products were demonstrated were the center of at - traction. We maintained experienced people there to make up the various dishes that can be made from milk, and the Dairy Division at </seg>

There were about twelve thousand sets distributed, showing you to some extent how interested the general public is. These recipes will be printed in our Yearbook. To those who did not secure the recipes at the Fair, I would suggest you call the atten - tion of your good wife to them, and you can have some of these clioice dishes made up at home. I want to say at this time that we feel greatly indebted to Professor J. H. Frandsen as Chairman of the Committee in charge, for the splen - did work that was done at the Fair, both as to getting up the booths and arranging for the demonstration of the dairy products. Your Association had printed and distributed ten thousand book - lets entitled "The Future of Dairying," by Professor J. H. Frandsen. The demand exceeded the supply. We will have this reprinted in the Year - book so that those of you who did not receive a copy may have an op - portunity of reading it later. It is good. They tell us our parade at the State Fair was the "best ever." We appreciate the kindness of the State Fair Board, and especially Messrs. E. R. Danielson and W. W. Cole, who made its success possible. They have promised us that it will be still better next year. Your Association also furnished the cash prizes for the Boys' and Girls' Calf Club demonstration at the State Fair, and in this way encouraged the young boys and girls interested in dairying to do even better next year. We also helped defray the expense of the Student Stock Juding Team that was sent to Waterloo. I should like to suggest that every member constitute himself a committee of one to send in one or more names to the Association as new members, for the larger our membership, the greater will be our power. Every dairyman in Nebraska should be a member of this Asso - ciation. We trust you will at all times feel free to make suggestions as to what you think should be done to further the interests of the dairymen in this State. , No doubt the legislature which is now in session will be asked to pas3 several bills affecting you and the dairy industry. I hope that you will keep in close touch with your representative and see that he looks after your welfare. This year we would like to enlarge upon the educational work which was begun last year. I feel that we ought to become better posted on the tubercular test. The legislature will be asked to appro - priate more money to reimburse those who have losses through tuber - cular cattle. I am pleased to say the reports show that each year the percentage of tubercular cattle is growing less, something like 4 per cent of the cattle this past year being tubercular. Let us work </seg>

Now is the opportune time to go into the dairy business stronger than ever. Feed is cheaper than it has been for several years, and the price of milk is such that you can make a profit. It is about the only sure thing on the farm today. The milk check comes regularly, and the market is always open. When the price of all your produce is 1 low. get a few more cows. To those who have not any, get some, and help make up some of the losses that you have had to take, and are taking. I would like to see you men get back of a bill for a Test Barn on the State Farm. There are quite a few breeders through the State who have one or more cows, and if they could put them on official test and see how much milk and butter fat each produced, they would be glad to send them in to the Farm and have it done. At home, the cost is high (or a few cows, but if we could have a Barn here, the propor- tionate cost would be very low. Let me suggest that these men who do not like the clause in the dairy bill which calls for a dollar license, should get busy and see the legislature amends that bill. As we have a good program coming, I will not burden you with a longer report at this time. You will notice from our Financial Report which I am about to read that we show a balance on hand, which was held back to defray our expenses at the annual meeting. I thank you. (Applause.)

It gives us a splendid op - portunity to get acquainted with these men who are doing the big things for us. and opens up an avenue for closer co-operation during the year.

N, Lawritson, Lincoln, Nebraska I am not going to take up very much of your time this morning trying to tell you how your dairy problems should be solved or how to run your farm, for if I did I might be embarrassed in delivering it as was the politician who was campaigning in a rural community. He wished to impress on those present that he was very much interested in the farmer and his welfare. He told how interested he had always been in the farm and its activities, and told how much he knew about farming, etc., adding, "In fact, I was raised between two rows of corn." At which a voice in the audience said, "Be jabers, he must be a pumpkin.." (Laughter.) So I am not going to try and tell you how much I know about dairy - ing nor am I going to attempt to tell you how you should farm as I want to avoid leaving the impression with you that I am a pumpkin. I want to discuss, for a few minutes, the extension projects we have in mind to carry out for the coming; year, rather than the subject as - signed to me. which was "Dairy Extension Activities During 1920." because the work in dairying was not active during 1920 previous to July 1st, therefore the work was not organized in such a way that any definite results can be given. The four main projects that we will work on for the coming year are; the Co-operative Bull Association, Boys' and Girls' Club work, Co - operative Cow Testing Association, and Livestock Improvement. The one phase of dairying that needs improvement most is the breeding of cattle on the farms. When you go about the state and see the mongrel and scrub animals in the farmers' barns, you wonder why they do not see their mistake, and improve their stock through breeding. As I see it, it is largely because he has not had the opportunity. Possibly his herd </seg>
            <seg id="p038">THIRTY-SIXTH ANNUAL. CONVENTION 39 &gt; is so small that he can not afford to own a pure-bred bull good enough to improve his stock so he has given up the idea of improving it through breeding. There is a lack of definite purpose in the breeding- of good dairy cattle on the part of the average farmer, and especially those who have only a few cows because they usually have them bred to the nearest available bull, often without regard to breed or breeding. The result is lack of improvement. Better bulls should be secured through the or - ganization of co-operative bull associations because such an association may bring about systematic and rapid improvement of the dairy cattle in the state, and be a means by which a man with limited capital can improve his herd as well as the wealthy breeder. It may also be a means of fighting infectuous diseases of cattle and securing better laws in regulating the control of disease, and stimulate the co-operative spirit in advertising and selling surplus stock and dairy products. ■ The object of such an association is to improve the type and pro - duction of dairy cattle and to show what can be accomplished through organization and working together as a unit. Now as to the plan of such an association, the association should be composed of from fifteen to thirty farmers that Jointly own from three ta five bulls. Its territory should be divided into what we term "breeding blocks," of from three to six members each, one bull being assigned to each block. As many as forty to sixty cows may belong to the farmers in each block, and the bull in the "block" should be kept on a farm conveniently situated. To prevent inbreeding each bull is moved to the next block every two years, and if all bulls live, and are kept until each has made one complete circuit, no new bulls need be purchased for six to ten years. In this way each member of the association has the use of good pure - bred bulls for many years, at a cost of only a small part of the purchase price of one bull. The method of carrying this plan out is for the extension specialist and the county extension agent to co-operate in the organization of such an association, carefully explaining the plan for the benefit aid in selec - tion of bulls, etc., and assert every effort to make the association a per - manent community institution, but it is largely up to the members to keep it alive and growing and derive the benefits from It. The importance of the boys' and girls' club work hardly needs to be discussed as most of you are familiar with this work and know its value. The Cow Testing Association is an important project because it fits in very well with the bull association in showing the farmer where his profits may be increased by detecting and discarding the "star - boarders" in his herd, along with this it teaches better methods in the feeding, care, and management of dairy cattle, which is an important factor to be considered. </seg>
            <seg id="p039">40 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION The project on Livestock Improvement fits in very well also. If money situation will permit, we plan to bring a better type of dairy stock into the state to replace those found to be unprofitable. There are about 600,000 so called dairy cows in this 1 state, but a very small per - centage of these would qualify as specialized dairy cows, so it is im - portant that we turn to the better type of dairy cow. Dairying is becoming a more important occupation each year and fits in -very well with other types of farming especially where crop rotation is not practiced to any great extent. The farmers are begin - ning to realize the relation of dairying to soil fertility. Commercial fertilizers are too expensive and the feeding "game" is too uncertain so they are turning to dairying which is a surer proposition. The object of discussing these projects at this time is to give you an idea of our plan of work and if you feel any of them are needed in your community you can discuss them with your neighbor when you go home. It would be a good plan to discuss your needs with your county agent also and if he feels any of these projects could be worked out the ex - tension service will be glad to co-operate and lend any assistance that is desired. In addition to the projects mentioned, we will carry on other minor projects if the time permits, but most of the time will be spent on those mentioned. If any one has any questions or suggestions, I should be glad to entertain them. Possibly you have in mind some projects that you consider more important, if so, I will be glad to hear them dis - cussed. I would like to hear any suggestions or criticisms you may have along this line, because it is the suggestions and criticisms from you that will help us put these projects in a form that will be practical and do the most good. (Applause.) THE PRESIDENT: Last fall when your Program Committee was trying to find individuals to put on this program who would bring a real message into this State, at the time of the National Dairy Show we came in contact with a number of representatives of the dairy busi - ness. We wanted to put on some men who were really big in the game, and I am pleased to say we have been successful in bringing some of them here at this time. After you have heard and seen the speaker whom I am about to introduce to you, if you think he isn't big, you can complain to me. The next speaker is J. G. Winkger, of the United States Dairy Division. (Applause.) HOW BEST TO IMPROVE THE DAIRY HERD Mr. J. G. Winkger, Washington, D. C. Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: I came here with the in - tention of not telling any stories, but the speaker before me makes me think I should tell one. It relates to the first time I went out in the State of North Dakota, in 1886, to make a talk. Going so far and having such an important subject, I thought I ought to prepare myself. So I </seg>
            <seg id="p040">THIRTY-SIXTH ANNUAL CONVENTION 41 • - prepared a speech- on the testing and records of dairy cows. When I arrived at my destination, I found the meeting, which was booked for the evening, was to be held in a church. The church was packed with people, and I learned there were only two farmers present. What was worse, in the back part of the church were a lot of young people. f there is anything that disturbs a bashful speaker more than that, I do not know what it is. I was going to mention what a good record a cow named "Dora" had made. I found one of the girls was named Oora, and that broke up the meeting for the rest of the evening. (Laughter.) I am glad to learn that one of your next projects is the Co-opera - tive Bull Association, because it is so well fixed by the other projects around it — the Test Association, and the Boys' and Girls' Club work, [f those projects are carried through, you will see results in the near future. Your leader has told you about these co-operative associations, but I may have some thoughts that will help to emphasize the statements he had made. A strapping healthy idea was the idea of the Co-operative Bull As - sociation when it came to this country from Denmark and landed in Michigan about 1908. On account of its strength, good 1 looks, and gen - eral favorable appearance it was enthusiastically put to work and so vigorously that for a while the idea was in danger of being "worked to death" before it became acclimated. It was on account of the apparent breakdown that, for several years, the vigor of the idea seemed waning and did not command popular attention or favor. There were those, however, who did not lose faith, and the con - fidence and nursing given the idea has not only restored it to its full health, 'out during the period of recuperation it has become acclimatized thoroughly Americanized, and been given the characteristic American vigor and today the idea is acclaimed by those who have used it most as having outstanding merits and as being one of the best ways to bring about better breeding of dairy stock. On July, 1920, over thirty states had one or more co-operative bull associations, and some of these states have taken up the bull association plan as their major pro - ject in dairy extension work. The states of Mississippi, South Carolina, and Pennsylvania, have dairy extension men who pay particular atten - tion to the organization of co-operative bull associations and give them, assistance after organized. As a result these states are leading in^the number of association Mississippi had 11 associations, South Carolina 17, and Pennsylvania 21, on July 1, 1920. To those interested in the development of the dairy industry it Is a constant source of satisfaction to see that the co-operative bull as - sociation is not only doing what it is designed for, but as time goes' on the view from new angles reveals additional qualities of usefulness that </seg>
            <seg id="p041">42 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION were not originally looked for, some of which give greater benefits than the one which was the object of the invention. The question of finances involved in purchasing a good pure-bred bull was undobutedly the primary cause for inventing the co-operative bull association. The fundamental basis for the plan is as old as the legendary story of the father who illustrated to his sons that bundle of sticks was strong, while each stick by itself could be easily broken, and it is as sound as the mathematical proposition that two and two make four. One farmer has a bull worth $500 and across the road his neighbor also has a bull worth the same- amount. Both together have a thousand dollars invested in bulls, yet each has only a five hundred dollar bull, while if they had their money invested under the plan of the bull association each would, in an association of five blocks, not only have a thousand dollar bull for his $500 invested, but would for no more money have the use of five $1 000 bulls; and what is more, it is not necessary for a dairyman to have five hundred dollars to make use of this plan. A man with one cow and twenty dollars can get in on this deal; fifty cows in a block will give a chance for the man with one cow to let his be one of the fifty subscribed, and with his $20 he has a share in five $1,000 bulls just as truly as- the man with $500 and with 25 cows subscribed. There are figures from actual associations that confirm these illustrations. Each member of a bull association, started in 1910, had bulls for the first eight years at an actual cost of only $1.50 per cow, the bull's average value being about $150 when pur - chased. In St. Louis County, Minnesota, after the misfortune of a forest fire, nine co-operative bull associations had to be established. 35 bulls are owned in these associations and the members own 1859 cows or 53 cows per bull. At an average of $300 per bull, the total cost of these bulls would be $10,500. Figures from 2,000 farms show that when there is no bull association one bull is used for about 18 cows. Applying this figure to the cows owned by the members who are in the bull associa - tions' of St. Louis County, Minnesota, the number of bulls needed would be 103, and supposing them to be of value equal to the ones now owned by the associations, the total investment would have been $30,900 instead of the $10,500. It follows that the individual members of bull associations have much more for their money by investing in such an organization than when each one purchases a bull alone. There are numerous incidents in lfcill associations which show this to be the case. An association in Pennsylvania shows that the average investment per farmer was $211, for which the farmer had a share in four $600 bulls. In another association in the same state $365 was invested by each farmer and four $1,200 bulls were owned. In two associations' in Missouri $45.97 invest - ment per member in one case has given each member a share in twelve $275 bulls. </seg>
            <seg id="p042">THIRTY-SIXTH ANNUAL CONVENTION 43 The economy is not confined to the dairyman who is already able to own a bull. It embraces the one who can not own one, even to the man with so small a dairy herd that he would think be could not afford to pay for the keep of a bull if it was given to him; in fact, it was for these men that the hull association was originally designed. The State of Nebraska has many farmers who would belong to this last class, for the 1920 census shows that 601,000 milk cows are owned on 126,309 farms in the state so that the average dairy herd of Nebraska is about four cows. If the average dairy farmer of this state is to go into, and stay in pure breeding he must use some plan like the co-operative bull asso - ciation. A greater feature of usefulness of the bull association, however, is the fact that through the system of exchange the bulls are retained in the association and eventually their value will be shown by the pro - duction of their daughters. Statistics from 3,552 farmers in dairy districts of the State of New York shows that 78 per cent of the bulls used were under three years of age and less than 3 per cent were five years or over. No doubt this is a fair representation of the condition in other sections of the country. Very little can be known about a bull's ability to transmit his ancestors' milk-producing qualities before the bull is five years old, and when the figures indicate that less than 3 per cent of the bulls are five years or over, it calls our attention to the immense handicap dairymen are placed under in reproducing the more profitable dairy cows. The general impression confirms this fact, for the expression "We have some good daughters from a bull we sold to the butcher and we wish we had him back," is made very frequently. It is not only among the ordinary bulls that this is true, but all dairymen are afflicted more or less with the trouble. Bell-founder, the sire of the recent world's champion Guernsey cow, was sold to the butcher before his worth was known. This sire had a few daughters with records that would attract attention even if the one of them had not become a world's champion. Sophie's Tormentor was killed before his value was known. Aggis Cornucopia Pauline Count 13th was sold to the butcher for $50; when his value was discovered it was conservatively placed at $5,000. All breeds have made their sacri - fice, and without question the benefit of the bull association in stopping this practice is much greater than that of enhanced value of the invest - ment. Either one alone of the two advantages mentioned is sufficient rea - son for forming a bull association. The financial advantage was the one that first attracted attention to the bull association and the saving of the tried bulls is a greater advantage which came into prominence as </seg>
            <seg id="p043">44 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION the organization has developed. So, also, as time goes on, other advan - tages come in sight which loom up in importance until we have com - menced to measure them with the first two, and further, time may show some of the new advantages to be even greater than the two already mentioned. , The advantage of establishing a breed in a community is no small matter. The attempt of small farmers to own purebred bulls singly, leads to spasmodic efforts at establishing one breed. The ownership of a bull in such cases changes from one man to another and at each change there may be a change in breed, and as small farmers us their neighbors' bulls, there is a constant change in breed which is the main cause of so many herds' being made up of an endless mixture of breeds. On the establishment of a bull association this vacillation ceases and permanent pure breeding in a distinct line continues from generation to generation and gives communities the advantage of hav - ing hundreds of head of purebred stock that will command attention in all markets. The small dairyman, even the one-cow owner, may go into pure breeding with the assurance that he can continue on the line on which he starts and have a satisfactory market for his surplus stock. The tendency of the bull association in this line is so strong that even the man with no time nor inclination to law out a plan for a good line of breeding, is carried along by this organization and will continually be breeding better stock. Comparatively few herds are bred for a long period of time. A dis - persal sale scatters a lifetimes effort of one man. The bull associa - tion, however, can live on from one generation to another indefinitely. Experience has already shown that members of associations may leave, but there is always someone to take the vacant places and so the change may go on until there is an entire change of membership and still the same association and the same line of breeding live on indefinitely. No one can foresee the great benefits that will come from the bull associa - tion. The districts where the Ayrshire, Guernsey, Jersey and Holstein cattle came from can give us a sort of forecast of what may happen in a well-managed and long continued bull association. A member in the Dagget, Michigan, association, organized in 1916, says that at a recent county fair 85 per cent of the dairy stock was of the Holstein breed, the breed used by the bull association, and 75 per cent of these Holsteins were exhibited by members of the association. In South Carolina at the Greenwood Fair, October last, 23 Jersey - bulls were exhibited, all owned by bull associations in the western part of the state. The fair association gave liberal prizes to the association exhibit. Members came to the fair and took a lively interest in the ex - hibition. It is safe to say that the future has something in store for this district where the many members of many bull associations are centered on the same breed and, to a great extent, on the same line of breeding. </seg>
            <seg id="p044">THIRTY-SIXTH ANNUAL CONVENTION 45 Organization Important The bull association is one of the simplest kind of organizations and on account of its simplicity the importance of the organization is easily overlooked. Sometimes men interested get the impression that all that is neces - sary to have a bull association is for several groups of farmers to buy each a bull and then at a later date arrange for an exchange. This proceeding does not make a bull association, in fact, it has been re - peatedly shown to be a hindrance to the forming of an association. It is the organization, the solid and compact, although simple, organiza - tion, that will give the benefits 1 of the bull association. It is the organiza - tion that enhances the value of the money in the purchase of bulls; it is tbe organization that assures the periodic exchange of the bulls and eventually makes it possible to try and keep him if proven good, or dispose of him if proven bad or indifferent; it is the organization that buys the bulls and establishes one line of breeding; it is the organiza - tion that lives on and on even if the membership is in course of time entirely changed. The organization is the modern, invention which gives all these advantages and makes it possible for the members to reach the outside world and for the outside world to reach them. Officers and members have to realize the existence and value of the organization if they are to receive the full benefits of a bull association. This realization has to influence the directors, so that when business of the organization comes before them they attend to it as businesslike as if it were a bank organization. A properly constructed organization is the first process in establish - ing a co-operative bull association. There is nothing that can take its' place and there will be no bull association without this organization. Unfortunately the organization can not be sent ready made for use, It must be manufactured and made ready on the ground and in a measure according to the material and the wishes of the members. In as much as this 1 is the case, the ones who become members have had no previous experience and the one organization will be the only one they form. Usually a co-operative bull association covers a county so that it is not often that a county agent gets the experience of organizing more than one association. It is obvious, therefore, that the best organizations will not be formed unless 1 information and assistance is obtained from someone with experience and the state extension forces should be called on for assistance. Some states have deemed it of sufficient Im - portance to have a man whose special function it Is to give assistance to bull association, assisting in the organization and later in the opera - tion of the co-operative bull associations. Whenever three or more purebred bulls can be placed In a district, any part of which Is not more than about five miles from a common meeting place, there an association can be organized. </seg>
            <seg id="p045">NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION 46 THE PRESIDENT: Our next speaker is Professor Frandsen. He needs no introduction to this audience. His topic is "The Future of Dairying." (Applause.) PROFESSOR J. H. FRANDSEN: Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentle - men: I have looked over your program. Since we were late in start - ing yesterday and have a large number of splendid speakers yet to be heard from, something must be done to relieve the situation. I have a little surprise for you. We have with us today a man who is not on the program, but who has a reputation as one of the leading men in dairying in the eastern states. You have heard me for nine years. You have not had a chance to hear this other man, so I am going to yield my time to him in order that he may have all the time he needs to cover the subject. I am not leaving Lincoln. I am changing my work a little. Possibly this story will illustrate what I have in mind. Two fellows who had studied together for the ministry, separated soon after their college days were ended, and did not meet again for fifteen years. The man who was still in the ministry thought of course his friend had remained in the work. He said, "Hello, Bill! You look fine! What church, are you with?" Church? I am in the wholesale hide business, "Why did you leave the church?" "For seven reasons." "What are they?" "My wife and six children." (Laughter.) My reasons are not quite so numerous, but they are a wife and three children. As I think some of you have heard, I recently accepted a position as dairy editor for the Nebraska farm papers — six of them. I believe it will offer me as good an opportunity to continue in educational work, and perhaps to meet more of you than a man who is tied up in executive work here. With that belief I will make the change, and hope I will continue to have the esteem and friendship of the people I have enjoyed so much during my seven years here. The man I am going to introduce is Mr. A. A. Borland, professor of dairy husbandry of the Pennsylvania State College. Before that he was professor of dairying in Vermont. We hear much of his good work back there, and I am anxious we should have an opportunity to listen to him this morning. (Applause.) A MESSAGE FROM 1 PENNSYLVANIA Professor A. A. Borland, Harrisburg, Pa. It is kind of Professor Frandsen to give his time to me this morn - ing. I hope we won't spend the time entirely unprofitably. </seg>
            <seg id="p046">'THIRTY-SIXTH ANNUAL CONVENTION 47 I suppose I look a good deal like a stranger to you folks', but I don't feel quite so strange as I look, because in 1885 my grandfather came to Nebraska with his wife and a considerable percentage of his twelve children, and settled here in Table Rock; so I have a lot of relatives scattered over the State of Nebraska, a great many of whom I have never seen. I might testify to the healthful climate I think you have, because a few years ago when my grandparents celebrated their golden wedding anniversary, they were hale and hearty, as were all their twelve children and grandchildren, and a sprinkling of great-grandchildren. I do not know whether anyone ever dies out here or not. I further do not feel very strange for the reason I have had the value of Professor Frandsen's acquaintanceship and friendship for a number of years, and I join with you folks in congratulating him upon being called to a more responsible position, perhaps; and. I am doubly glad with you in that he will not be severed from active participation in the dairy interests of this state. I am sure we all join in wishing him the greatest of success in his new position. I had an instructor who took his post-graduate work under Professor Frandsen in the State of Nebraska. He was always telling what a great State Nebraska is, and what a great professor Frandsen is. I am glad to say that after I came to know Professor Frandsen, I think Loveland told nothing but the truth about him. Perhaps I am even in a better position than you folks to know in what high esteem Professor Frandsen is held in dairy work. I have known him for a number of years, and know he is held in high regard. We think we have quite an agricultural state in Pennsylvania, but when I knew I was to speak to you, I began to look up and see what you were doing. I will say my esteem for your state raised considerably when I began to look into your agricultural statistics. Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, in the southeastern part of the state, is commonly ac - credited with being the richest agricultural county in the United States. When I looked you up, and found out here, while we are producing 4,000,000 tons of hay in Pennsylvania, you are producing 8,000,000 tons in Nebraska; and while we are growing corn to the extent of 80,000,000 bushels, you folks are working overtime and raise 180,000,000 bushels, and last year you raised 250,000,000 bushels; and while we harvest 30, - 000,000 bushels of wheat, you are harvesting about 60,000,000 bushels annually; and while we raise about 1,000,000 bushels of barley, you are raising 5,000,000 bushels; and while we are raising a little less than 1, - 000,000 bushels of rye, you are raising 5,500,000 bushels, I take off my hat to the agriculture of Nebraska! But when it comes 1 to buckwheat the Pennsylvania farmer simply cannot get along without buckwheat cakes and sausage for breakfast. (Laughter and applause.) So we raise about 5,000,000 bushels of buckwheat, and you folks don't pay much attention to it </seg>
            <seg id="p047">NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION 48 When I look up the statistics regarding livestock, my respect for your livestock industry is 1 further increased. We have a lot of horses and mules in Pennsylvania — a little over half a million of them — but you have over a million. While we raise half a million steers, you are raising over a million. While our sows produce about four pigs, yours are producing fourteen pigs. You have three and one-half times as many hogs as we have — a million in Pennsylvania, and three and one - half million in Nebraska. We have a few more chickens than you have — thirteen million as compared with your nine and one-half millions. I account for that in this way: Pennsylvania, while only one-half as large as Nebraska — 28,000,000 acres as compared with your 49,000,000 — is divided up into small farms. We have one and three-fourths times' as many farms in an area about half as great — over 300,000 farms, as compared with 126.000 farms in Nebraska. Our farms average 140 acres, while yours average 380 acres each. We have a few more dairy cows in Pennsylvania — one million, while you have two-thirds' of that number. So I have a great deal of respect for your live stock industry in Nebraska. There is just one thing, however, about the live stock industry In Nebraska I think is open to a considerable amount of improvement. When I read the last census statistics, I find the dairy cows in Nebraska, according to those figures, are producing about three quarts of milk each per day. Three quarts is not a big production. Perhaps the census figures are a little bit out of gear in that, and a large number of cows are included as dairy cows that have no business to be classed as such. But even if it were six quarts instead of three, that would be too low a pro - duction to be profitable. Only when a cow gives eight quarts a day is she paying for her work — at least in Pennsylvania. What Nebraska needs, in my opinion, is not more cows, but better cows. (Applause.) I am going to refer to this chart to bring out my thought in that connection. In one of the cow-testing associations, of which you have already heard cnsiderable this morning, the cows were classified at the end of the year according to their production. In one class were placed all the cows that had produced at least 10,000 pounds of milk the pro - ceeding year. The average was 10,867 pounds of milk. In the next class were placed the cows producing between 9,000 and 10,000 pounds of milk — 9,326 pounds being the average of fourteen cows; so we find there is 1,000 pounds difference between each class. In the last class were placed the cows giving between 3,000 and 4,000 pounds of milk. The butter fat production of course went hand in hand along with the production of milk. These nigh-producing cows averaged 380 pounds of butter tat; then we hare those averaging 343 pounds; 301 pounds, 277 pounds, and down to 117 pounds— the average being 248 pounds. </seg>
            <seg id="p048">THIRTY-SIXTH ANNUAL CONVENTION 49 The next column gives the feed bill. The high- producing cows ate a lot of food — $88 worth; the next class ate the same; the next, $83 worth; then $81, and down to $56 worth. So as production runs down, the cost of feeding runs down. These high-producing cows must eat a lot of food in order to make milk, for that is what it is made of. I have had farmers say to me, "My cows do not produce much, but they don't eat much food, and at the end of the year perhaps I am as far ahead as my neighbor whose cows eat their heads off." Who is right? This next column I think answers that question very directly. It was found when these high-producing cows had paid their feed bill, they had left over $106 per cow. The next class had left $79; then $63; next $52, and down to those which did not pay for their feed bill. That tells what kind of cows a man must have in order to made a decent living. He must have cows that are fairly liberal pro - ducers — 6,000 to 7,000 pounds — in order to be really worth while. It has been found after the feed bills were paid, a man must have left at least $50 in order to pay for labor, interest on his investment, and the other costs in producing the milk. We hear a lot about how much it costs to produce milk. There is a direct relation between the yield of milk per cow and the food cost of producing that milk. These cows produce 100 pounds at a food cost of 82 cents. Notice how the cost of production runs up as the average yield per cow runs down. These low-producing cows ate $1.86 worth to produce a pound of milk. We find exactly the same relation in regard to producing butter fat. Nebraska is a great butter state. How much does it cost to produce it? These high-producing cows ate 28 cents' worth to produce a pound of butter fat. The low-producing cows eat 49 cents worth to produce a pound of butter fat. So much for the importance of good cows if we are going to make money in the dairy business. I have recently been interested in figuring out the records of 1,400 cows. These cows in this cow-testing association are better than the average cows, because over one hundred unprofitable cows were weeded out in the course of the year. We classified them according to cows that had produced 400 pounds of butter fat, then those producing between 350 and 400 pounds; then 300 to 250 pounds; 200 to 150 pounds, and less than 150 pounds of butter fat production. This is the way the feed bills ran for those cows: Those that pro - duced 400 pounds, ate $87.03 worth of feed, and so on down to $44 worth of feed for the cows producing less than 150 pounds of butter fat. These are the returns after the feed bills were paid. After these 400 pound cows paid their feed bills, they had left an average of $114 profit per cow; then down to $23 profit per cow. The feed cott ot the </seg>
            <seg id="p049">50 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION pound of butter fat ran from 19 cents to 33 cents, so we find the same situation from the butter fat as from the milk standpoint. Those who have made a study of the factors essential to successful dairy farming tell us there are four important factors in making a profitable farmer. The first is a good sized farm. You can see how that is. The same amount of farm machinery that will take care of a comparatively small farm will almost take care of the larger acreage, with less expense per acre. The average Nebraska farm is 380 acres. It seems the farm ought to be above, rather than below, the average in order to be the most profitable. I notice by the last census that the farms in Nebraska are becoming larger. You have 3,369 fewer farms in 1920 than you had in 1910. So it is evident this' thing is working itself out in a practical way. There is a general realization a man must have a good sized farm in order to make money. The second essential is gdod crops. That goes without saying. Those who have conducted these farm surveys tell us 1 it will pay you to expend enough time and labor to increase the production of crops per acre from one-fourth to cne-third above the average of what is being produced in, your community right now. You can put on enough barn - yard manure, and practice crop rotation, and plow down the clover, so that your farm will turn off crops one-fourth to one-third better than the average in your neighborhood, and you will make money by doing It. It won't pay you to do enough work to try to raise twice as much crops as your neighbor. The third important factor for a successful farmer is diversity of crops — not having all the eggs in one basket. Don't get all your money from corn, or wheat, or hogs, or dairy cows, but a combination of those. There ought to be four or five important sources of income from your farms. Above that does not pay. It would not pay to have nine or ten different sources of income. That is putting 1 the eggs in too many baskets. The fourth important factor is the matter of good cows. It was found in New York that farmers whose cows were producing about $100 worth of butter fat were making less money than their own hired men. In Pennsylvania, a cow must produce $200 worth of milk or butter in order to pay her way. It might be interesting to you to know how much it costs to keep a cow in Pennsylvania. We have figured up, this cost for nearly 1,200 cows. How much does it cost to keep a cow here? In Pennsylvania, the average feed costs us $121.26 per cow. The labor bill averages $53 per cow. The overhead expenses — interest on investment and taxes 1 and Insurance and forks and pails and shovels and ice and salt and veterin - ary — were $60, bo that the total cost was over $230 per year. Her credits— manure, and increase In value of herd — amounted to $27 per cow, to that the net cost was $210. That was very carefully worked out. </seg>
            <seg id="p050">THIRTY-SIXTH ANNUAL CONVENTION 51 After allowing 10 per cent, which the United States government advo - cates as a fair allowance for your services as manager, the final cost was $231 per year. As I have said, in Pennsylvania our cows must produce $200 worth of milk or butter fat in order to pay their way. Your cows won't dare produce much less than that. Now I will show you the records of one herd in Pennsylvania. This came out of one of our cow-testing associations. This man had a pretty decent herd of cows, with some fairly good ones. Here is one that pro - duced 8,000 pounds of milk, and they averaged 5,757 pounds'. The value of the product was $72.50. The feed bills per cow were 69.77. After these were paid, he had left $2.73 per cow. You say, "There is some - thing wrong with that herd that after he feeds he has left only $2.73 per cow." Here is what is wrong. Here are seven cows that did not pay for the food they ate. Seven poor cows out of sixteen, and they were eating up the profits of the other cows. I never look at this table that I do not think of the dream of Pharaoh, where he dreamed seven lean cattle came out of the river and ate up the seven fat cattle. That is what the seven lean cows in this herd did — they ate up the profits of his whole herd. He could have kept only the two best cows and made as much, clear money from them as from his whole herd. He could sell those nine cows, and from the seven he has left he would make more than twice as much money as from his whole herd. But you do not have any herds like that in Nebraska! (Laughter.) If you have, some of your men are started on the road to the poor house. All our herds in Pennsylvania are not as bad as that. This man said at the beginning of the year, "I am not making money out of my cows. I cannot understand it." Just to be able to put your fingers on the identical cows making the money and the ones losing is a hard thing to do. At the end of the year he knew just where the trouble was, and was in position to help himself. But he said, "Well, I know too much about this herd now. I ought to sell these poorest cows, but I guess I won't stay in the cow-testing association next year." So he did not profit as he might have done." His neighbor, with the same kind of soil and markets, had a herd that were running up to 10.000 pounds of milk. The average for his herd was 8,170 pounds of milk, and 327 pounds of butter fat; so after his feed bills were paid, he had left $74 per cow. He weeded out the poorest; and the next year his average milk production went up to 9,400 pounds, with 376 pounds of butter fat. He had left after paying his feed bills, $96.96 per cow. He is not worrying. He is making money and likes it. Now, the question is, "How are we to get these good cows?" That simply means, as has already been said in your hearing this morning, </seg>
            <seg id="p051">NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION 52 a definite record of production of each cow in the herd. You can't pick them out by simply looking at them. While you or I could tell the difference between an extremely good cow and an extremely poor one, I defy you to distinguish as between a cow that makes $33 in profit, and another that only makes $6. For the life of you, you can't tell the difference. Those of you who were at the National Dairy Show saw the line of twelve cows with their production records sealed. They asked the people to form an estimate as to how much the production was of each cow. If you tried it out. you know how difficult it is to estimate the production of a cow from her looks. So that there must be a definite record of production. That simply means the cow-testing association. I think a very considerable amount of the improvement in dairying in Pennsylvania in the last few years has been directly due to the cow testing associations. We have sixty of them in our State. They are certainly doing a splendid work in sifting out the profitable from the unprofitable cows. That is the first essential in better cows. The average record of these cows in the cow-testing association in Pennsylvania was 6,541 pounds of milk and 248 pounds of butter fat. Now that is a yield of one and one-half to two times as great as the average cow in Pennsylvania, so it stands to reason that these cow - testing associations are doing something in the way of improving pro - duction. After you have weeded out the unprofitable cows in your herd, what Is the next step? These manufacturing establishments know that to the efficiency of the machines is due in a large measure the money they make out of them. Some manufacturing establishments have thrown out good machines because another was invented that would do the work more efficiently. These cows are machines, and we must get the most efficient machines if we are going to make money. The next step is what Mr. Winkger has been talking about — a good and pure-bred sire. He must not only be pure-bred. It must go farther than that, because some of the worst investments men have made are for money in a pure-bred sire. Don't misunderstand me. On the aver - age, a pure-bred bull is better than a grade, and a grade better than a scrub. But there are pure-bred scrubs. If a pure-bred bull has a low - producing ancestry, he will have a low-producing offspring. Here are some concrete examples of the influence of the sire. These figures came from the Ohio Experiment Station. They have two herds — a Holstein and a Jersey. This is the Holstein herd. The average yield of these cows for their lacteal periods was 7,392 pounds of milk and 231 pounds of butter fat. After getting a pure-bred bull with good records, see what his daughters did. They averaged 8,568 pounds of milk and 273 pounds of butter fat — an increase over their dams' of over 1,100 pounds of milk and 42 pounds of butter fat. That is a nice increase. Then they bought another bull and paid twice as much as for the first </seg>
            <seg id="p052">THIRTY-SIXTH ANNUAL CONVENTION 53 one, because he had high records back of him. His daughters produced 11,599 pounds' of milk and 384 pounds of butter fat. Compare this pro - duction with the original grand-dams', and there is an increase of 4,207 pounds of milk and 153 pounds of butter fat. This is the Jersey herd. The average yield of these Jersey cows was 5,275 pounds of milk and 287 pounds of butter fat. They got a Jersey bull that was 1 supposed to be a good one, coming out of one of the best Jersey herds in the State. His dam had no record back of her. what do you expect from a bull whose dams and grand-dams have no record? It is a gamble. He graded them down, and bis daughters averaged 4,583 pounds of milk, and 248 pounds of butter fat. Then they got busy and bought a bull from a high-producing dam and an imported sire, and he has brought them back as much as the other one let them down; so they are about where they started because they got a bull with no records back of him. We have had that same experience with the Pennsylvania State College and at Vermont and Missouri. There is a lot of data available to show the bull must not only be a pure-bred, but have good records back of him. How are you going to get that bull? You may pay from $1,000 to $50,000 for a bull if you want to. Mr. Winkger has outlined a safe, sane and practical method of getting a high-class sire without much cost. We had twenty-one bull associations in Pennsylvania last June. I have a farm in Mercer county. We have three bull associations there. I belong to the one at Grove City. There are about four blocks in that bull association. We got four good bulls — better than I could afford alone, but by going in with six others, the cost was not excessive. The breeder was anxious to put his bulls into a bull association and he let us have them at about half price, so things are going on nicely there. - It is a simple thing to switch these bulls at the end of two years. I only pay one-seventh of the cost of keep of that bull. So bull associations are active propositions in Pennsylvania. I believe you could do nothing better for the dairy interests of Ne - braska than to go after this 1 matter of bull associations. It is something that a man with four or five cows can go into. He could not afford a $1,000 bull. It is too expensive, and in two years he would have to buy another. They usually charge about $15 per cow as an investment. If he has ten cows, he puts in $150. With 70 cows to the block, that makes $1,050 to buy bulls, so they can get a $1,000 bull, and he can have an interest in four $1,000 bulls. That is a good business proposition. It will work in Nebraska as well as any other place. It is something I cannot emphasize too strongly for you folks to follow up through your extension work. The second thing I am going to talk about is better dairymen. (Ap - plause.) I won't hit you fellows very hard— those of you who are here— </seg>
            <seg id="p053">54 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION 4 because I will say without fear or favor that I have not the slightest doubt in my mind I am talking to the best dairymen in Nebraska here today. The very fact you folks are here to listen to these addresses and try to get something out of this meeting that is going to help you in your work, proclaims you to be the very best dairymen and the most progressive in the State. But there are a lot of fellows who are home, and who do not care a tinker's darn about the proposition. They don't know much about dairying, and don't care they don't know. You must improve the quality of the rank and file of the dairymen in Nebraska. There is no use of putting: good cows in the hands of a scrub dairyman. This is the value of education to a tarmer. No man can know too much about the business- in which he is engaged. The lawyer cannot know too much about law, or the doctor too much about medi - cine, or the farmer too much about argiculture, in order to make a suc - cess of the business. In Missouri, they found the profits' of the farmer who had gone to district school were $383 per year. Those who had more than a dis - trict school education made $655. In Indiana, Illinois, and Iowa — that is not very far away — they found these self-made fellows who never had any schooling were clearing $680 per year. Those with a common school education cleared $742; those with a high school education, $1,268; while those with a college education cleared $1,721 per year. Something to it, isn't there? Here is a $500 difference on the profits between a common school and high school education, and $1,000 difference between common school and college education, right out on the farm. I do not need to talk to you folks about the value of an education. You realize it, and want your boys and girls to go to school and college. But there are a lot of people in Nebraska who do not realize it. So do not only send your own boys and girls up here, but work on the neighbors who don't care so much about it. I find you have most excellent courses in dairying at this institution. You have the short winter course, which would do a boy a lot of good. He would rub elbows with the other boys and pick up some information. Then you have the course for the boys who attend four winters — the School of Agriculture. For the boy who is going right back home to put it into use, nothing will be finer. For the boys who can go away to spend four years in the University, they had better take it. I would like to impress on the boys and the young men the importance of an agricultural education for farming. Even the reading of dairy papers is helpful. "Hard's Dairyman" con - ducted a survey to find whether it paid farmers to read dairy papers. It was found those not reading them averaged $1.85 per cow, while the readers of such papers averaged $14.54 per cow. That is a high price to pay for the lack of reading dairy papers. These better dairymen you are going to have after they go through the University of Nebraska are going to be the fellows who will pay </seg>
            <seg id="p054">Thirty-sixth annual convention 55 more attention to high quality products. They will know about sanita - tion and a whole lot of things. I picked up a bulletin that told the quotation for butter in Chicago, December 31. If it scores 92, it was 55 cents a pound. If it scores 89, it was 45*4 cents a pound — just three points in the score making a dif - ference of 9Vi cents in price. If you could apply that to the 50,000,000 pounds of butter produced here, it would mean a difference of $4,750,000 to the dairy industry in Nebraska. And why couldn't we produce 92 scoring butter in Nebraska? Just a word about marketing. If you are going to get a good price for dairy products, you must know what it costs to produce them. Do you know what it costs to produce a quart of milk in Nebraska? In Pennsylvania, we are putting a leaf in our cow-testing books so that the men will keep the labor record, and the last page is a cost-of-pro - duction sheet. The College helps him to figure that out. You will be surprised to know how much it costs to produce a quart of milk. It cost on an average for 1,400 cows, for the year ending 1920. 8.2 cents a quart. That is about $3.81 per hundredweight. It costs 75 cents to produce a pound of butter fat. These cost records were a great help. I see one man who does not think it costs that much. Your feed cost must be less here, but your labor cost won't be very much less, and your overhead won't; so that it won't cost you far from that. The fact that these farmers had a record of what it cost to produce milk was one of the best things when it came to asking a fair price for it. They had indisputable evidence what it cost. I see on the program some discussion of what the farmers' milk plant is doing. We have quite a number of retail city milk plants owned by the farmers, where the milk is brought, pasteurized and distributed. It has been a splendid thing for the farmers to own their own city retail milk plant, but it won't be as adaptable to Nebraska as to Pennsylvania. We have 265 cities with a population of over 2,500. In Nebraska you have only twenty-nine. On the average, they figure a producer gets about 45 per cent of the consumer's dollar in the dairy business. Where they bring in their milk, these farmers are getting 72 per cent of the consumer's dollar. That is a good thing for a town in which it is adapted, but it won't be adapted to many Nebraska places. The three methods of co-operation being practiced in the east are these large milk producers' asociations — one at Boston, one in New York, another at Philadelphia and one at Pittsburgh. Those are large organ - izations for the purpose of selling milk for their members. They charge members 1 about one cent per hundred for selling this milk. In New York City, the consumer pays 17 cents a quart for milk. The producer sells his milk to the distributor at New York City for an average price of 10.6 cents per quart. On that basis, the producer gets 62 per cent of the ultimate cost to the consumer. </seg>
            <seg id="p055">56 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION At Pittsburgh, the milk is selling to the consumer for 15 cents a quart, and the producer gets 8% cents a quart, or 58 per cent of the ulti - mate cost to the consumer. In Lincoln, I called up Roberts' Dairy Company and asked what milk was selling for, and they said 14 cents. They said they pay to the farm - ers $2.55 for 3% per cent milk, which means 5.4 cents per quart; so you folks are getting 39 per cent of the ultimate cost to the consumer. You have a dairymen's sales association started here— the Midwest Sales Association. That is a fine thing for Nebraska. I cannot do better than advise the farmer, if you are selling milk in Lincoln or Omaha, to join such an association, because it will mean you will get a larger pro - portion of the consumer's dollar. I want to thank you for your attention. I have enjoyed being here, and will go home with pleasant recollections of the Nebraska Dairymen's Association. (Applause.) Questionaire Answers Given by Profesor Borland. Q. Some city people say, "You farmers are howling about it costing 75 cents to produce a pound of butter fat, and you are only getting 60 cents. How does it happen you are not all in the poor house? A. In figuring the cost of producing a pound of butter fat, a man's labor was charged at 30 cents per hour, and that is 1 not a big price for labor. That would be only $3 a day. Horse labor was charged at 20 cents per hour — a very moderate price. Interest was charged at 5 per cent on the investment. Feeds were charged at actual cost. This brings the cost to 75 cents for producing a pound of butter fat. Then how does it come you are not in the poor house? You take less than 30 cents an hour for your labor. You are working, perhaps, for 10 cents per hour, or working your wife and your children and not pay - ing them anything for their labor. You are taking maybe only 2 per cent interest on your investment, and letting the cows have feed at less than you could sell it for. Under these conditions, you could sell butter fat at 60 cents and not go to the poor house. Q. If you do it in any way, you are an I. W. W. or a bolshevist. I can't see yet there is any great advantage in agriculture along any lines at this present time. Most of the people on the farm are working for little or nothing. What is the solution? That is what I have been at - tending these meetings all week to learn. A. There does not seem to have been any direct solution. People are more and more flocking to the cities. If you were making big money on the farm, your boys would not be leaving it. The fact that farming means long hours and hard work and moderate pay is why they go to the Cities. Q. On your first charge you showed where cows made a profit of $80 a bead per year. </seg>
            <seg id="p056">THIRTY-SIXTH ANNUAL CONVENTION 57 A. Those fellows are not the ones who are leaving the farms. That applies to about two men in my own county. This is simply the average return per cow per year above the food cost. Out of that you would have to pay for labor and insurance and veterinary services and all those other expenses. Q. Take the very best thing you have shown up this morning, and you are only getting by. We have to have a solution whereby we can get at least the cost of production with a little profit. A. The thing I have been harping on is good cows. Q. I claim it does not make any difference whether you are a dairy - man or any other kind of an agricultural farmer, your interests are identical. It takes one to make the other. The thing that will enable dairy farmers to get by is to have good cows and get the best quality of products, and market them co-operatively to get the highest per cent — better cows, better dairying, and better marketing. HON W. G. WHITMORE, Valley: I hold in my hand a statement which Professor Frandsen handed me a day or two ago in regard to the performance of this cow — La Verna. Nobody pretends the records of these cows is possible of attainment by any ordinary dairyman. But I do believe that we come down here to learn to do things a great deal better than we have been doing them — how to raise better cows; how to be better dairmymen-farmers — in fact, experience and science meet in these gatherings here for a week. We ought to go home a great deal better prepared to make money out of our business. Here is what Professor Frandsen tells me: La Verna produced 29,555 pounds of milk last year. She produced 1,310.6 pounds of butter. While those records are certainly away beyond anything we can expect, isn't it fair to assume that under proper conditions, with proper educa - tion to start with, and proper management all around, we can have dairy cows in Nebraska that can do pretty nearly half what these cows do right here? If we did, we could make money. I also hold a letter from a friend of mine — Mr. Chapin, of Batavia, New York. I visited their farm and inspected their herd of Holsteln's last June. In this letter Mr. Chapin says: "We are quite elated over a cow that has made 36 pounds of butter in one week, 140 pounds in one month, and is producing 12 gallons of milk a day." We saw one hundred of those cows. They had to sit up nights to milk them. (Laughter.) It is my misfortune to have a way of telling the truth so that men think I am fooling. They do have men up through the night, as nearly all those best cows are milked four times in twenty-four hours. I have been coming to these meetings for forty years. I was one of the first to get it organized. I claim it is not only mighty pleasant to mingle with such people as come here year after year, but immensely profitable. </seg>
            <seg id="p057">NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION 58 I have no patience with the farmer In Nebraska, with our magnifi - cent soil and climate, who is forever bellyaching and telling he cannot make a living, but is worse off year by year. I do not want to boast, but I do believe if a man of ordinary intelligence will make the most of his opportunities in this State, he can, one year with another, get ahead. I came from New England where the hills were so steep that when a man rode down them on horseback, the horse's tail would knock his 1 hat off! My father was a fairly intelligent farmer, but he never saw the year he could clear up a thousand dollars on that farm. My brother there today, on the same old farm, is making, to my certain knowledge, more than ten thousand dollars a year. He has a dairy herd, and raises tobacco and garden truck. We must have sense enough to adapt our business to our environ - ment. When we find in Nebraska, or in New England, that we cannot make money on a certain line of business, let us look around and see if we cannot do something that will make us money. Forty-two years ago the prairie fires were sweeping over the prairies and burning up thousands of tons of magnificent grass. I said, "I will utilize some of that." I began mowing that grass, and in less than three years I had the contract for supplying the Omaha Street Railway Com - pany, which was using at that time seven hundred horses and mules, with all the hay they used for years and years against all comers. I made money. I shipped 12.000 tons of that prairie hay, which used to burn up, in one year, which enabled me to build a nice home. I could have sat down trying to raise potatoes until the crack of doom, and never got anywhere. It helps a man's judgment to come to such meetings as this. He must study his environment and study the markets. He certainly can make it, if he can anywhere on God's earth, in eastern Nebraska. (Ap - plause.) PROFESSO FRANDSEN: I want to emphasize the importance of the sire. Mr. Whitmore has spoken of the records made by some of our cows at the Farm. Surely you all realize with the ordinary grade cow, it would be a whole lot easier to increase production by the use of a good sire than with cattle bred up as well as the University herd. In spite of the fact our herd have been raised to a high average, here is what two sires did for the herd: Let us take Golden Shylock — a Jersey. When we checked up on his daughters, we found the use of that sire resulted in the production of daughters that gave 42 per cent more milk, and 47 per cent more butter fat, than their dams at the same age. That is interest - ing, because the higher the production, the harder it is to show increase. Coming to the Holstein herd, let us take Prince Ormsty. The daugh - ters coming from this sire showed 66 per cent more milk and 99 per cent more tat than their dams, as a direct result of that sire. We have not that sire now. </seg>
            <seg id="p058">THIRTY-SIXTH ANNUAL CONVENTION 59 Wouldn't it be valuable to be able to keep tab of what our good sires are doing? The system you have been discussing permits that. Professor Borland is keeping tab of what his cows are doing. If you are looking for cows, don't go there to buy, because he is apt to sell some of those star boarders! (Laughter.) This reminds me of a story of the South. A certain Colonel was ask - ing where there were some good cows for sale, and was told a darkey named Sambo had such an animal. The Colonel went to Sambo and said, "I hear you have a cow for sale?" "Yassah. But may I ask where you all is from?" "That doesn't make any difference." "Yassah, it does. You see when I sells this cow, I wants to be sure the man libes two thousand miles away, 'cause I wants to get rid, not only of the cow, but of all conversation appertaining thereto." (Laughter.) THE PRESIDENT: Our dairymen know we do not have to go away from Nebraska or this community to find where they have to sit up nights to milk the cows. There are cows milking in this community that will produce $100 worth of milk a month, and we can find those herds; and it would be a good thing for the dairymen before they leave this town to visit some of them. I refer to the Woodlawn Holstein herd, Mr. Young's Jersey herd, the Union College Holstein herd — I cannot name them all. Upon motion, the convention adjourned until 1:30 P. M. </seg>

A. Morrison. REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON RESOLUTIONS I. " WHEREAS, Professor J. H. Frandsen, head of the Dairy Depart - ment of the University of Nebraska, has occupied that position for ten years, and has been instrumental in the splendid development of this Department in our State Institution; and WHEREAS, he is now withdrawing from this work; therefore, be it RESOLVED, That we, the Nebraska State Dairymen's Association, in our annual meeting assembled, express 1 to Profesor Frandsen our sincere appreciation of the work he has done for the Dairy Department. We especially desire to emphasize ihe help he has been to the dairy farms over the State, not only in assisting them so that they are able to increase their production, but also for the assistance he has been in helping to develop a good market for dairy products. During his connection with the University, he, together with his associates and the Dean of the College of Agriculture, developed this work to the extent that they were able to prove to our legislature that we needed much larger and better quarters for this Department, as a re - sult of which we have this splendid building and equipment for the de - velopment of the future dairymen of the State. While we appreciate the splendid work Professor Frandsen has done for tbe State, and greatly regret losing him from this work, yet we wish him outstanding achievement in his new field of activity. II. RESOLVED, That the legislature be asked to make appropriation for a barn to house and care for privately owned cows to be sent in for test - ing purposes, and to preserve the records which are made of same. III. RESOLVED, That the Nebraska State Dairymen's Association highly appreciates and commends the Dairy Department of the University of Nebraska for its great work in breeding and developing the champion butter cow owned by any state institution or agricultural college and that special credit and mention in this connection be given to the man behind the cow — the herdsman of the University dairy herd — Nels Anderson. IV. WHEREAS, the law enacted by the legislature requiring farmers selling whole milk to obtain a license, is unfair, unjust, and an inex- </seg>
            <seg id="p060">THIRTY-SIXTH ANNUAL CONVENTION 61 cusable tax on the production of our most important food, the produc - tion of which is none too profitable at best; and WHEREAS, the enforcement of this law tends to obstruct and diminish production; be it RESOLVED, That we, the Nebraska Dairymen's Association ask the present legislature to repeal said law. JOHN PRAZEUR, C. E. MORSE, E. W. FROST, Committee. The above resolutions were adopted separately without a dissenting voice, with the exception of Resolution IV, on which the following discus - sion was had: MR. D. M. HILDERBRAND: I believe that would be a mistake, for the reason that in going about over the United States I find that an effort is being put forth to free cattle from tuberculosis. I notice one county in Wisconsin was the only free county from tuberculosis in that State. I cannot see where it works a hardship on the average breeder, so long as appropriations have been made by both government and state. It is certainly for the help of the community. I do not believe if a man would go through the South Omaha packing house and see the animals that are diseased, he would for one minute want his- family to take milk from a cow that is tubercular. The license fee is only one dollar, which ia merely to make a record of the various herds over the State. I cannot see why the Nebraska dairymen would want to go on record as against a law that is beneficial to them. As a buyer of dairy cattle, I would prefer to pay $100 more for a cow from an accredited herd than to buy cattle over the territory. That is going to be the best recommendation for any breeder to have his herd accredited. MR. JOHN FRAZEUR: I do not think the gentleman knows what he is talking about. This license law has nothing whatever to do with the tubercular test. There is no excuse under heaven for this license law, unless it is to get a dollar more from each farmer into the State treasury. They require every man milking five or more cows to buy a license and pay a dollar. As I said if he is going to tax the dairyman for the privilege of milking cows at a loss, he should tax the corn and wheat producer. MR. HILDEBRAND: A man does not have to have his cows tested if he delivers his milk to a wholesaler who pasteurizes. MR. FRAZEUR: You must have a license under the present law. VOICES: That's right! Resolution IV was then adopted. </seg>

PIERSON, Lincoln: I second the motion The motion, which was put by Mr. Ryan, carried unanimously. » WHAT THE FARMERS' MILK PLANT HAS DONE" Mr. John Frazeur, Secretary Midwest Milk Producers' Association, Omaha, Nebraska Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: I was thinking this week about the difference in the questions discussed at organized farmers' meetings now, and when I first commenced attending them. While Mr. Borland talked a little this morning on production, it is not stressed like it was when I first attended farmers' meetings some years ago. In those days they talked increased production, economy of production, and increasing sojl fertility. The boys of my age were beginning to come home from college, bringing with them scientific methods' of agriculture and the increasing and cheapening of production. Our fathers found this virgin soil of Nebraska immensely rich. It was easy to get the maximum crops, and labor was cheap. I can re - member when the farmers used to pay twelve dollars a month for a hired man, and he worked, too, believe me J He worked more than your hired man does. Their problem was finding a market. It was a long, long road to the markets of the east with the products of the Nebraska farms. It seems now we have almost completed the circle. The average farmer today farms more scientifically than the very best farmers when I became of age — not so very long ago. The ordinary farmer has had some training in the agricultural college. Margins have narrowed. As land speculation has boosted land prices and the man </seg>
            <seg id="p062">THIRTY-SIXTH ANNUAL CONVENTION 63 who owns a farm has to pay a higher price, and labor has demanded higher wages, it has become increasingly difficult in our business to make ends meet. Nowadays a man to (arm successfully must be a good business men. The milk producers are having a particularly hard time — have had. During the war labor was hard to get, and much of the cost of milk pro - duction is in labor. The Secretary of the Chicago Milk Producers' Asso - ciation said there were seven profits between the milk pail and the glass of the consumer. I believe the question of marketing milk is the biggest problem we have before us today. Mr. Borland told us that the average cow in Pennsylvania gave about six thousand pounds of milk per year. If the farmer could have received five cents more per hundred weight, he could much more than double his profits. And how easy it would come! If by better marketing methods' you could double your profit, you have ac - complished something. I am here today not to talk to you about what I think we ought to do, but to tell you something about what we have done. I take lots of satisfaction in saying those words, "have done," because we have done something. You gave me the subject, "What a Farmers' Milk Plant Can Do." I will change it a little and say, "What a Farmers' Milk Plant Has Done." We have shortened this long road to the consumer. It is not across country a thousand miles, but it is a long road yet through these seven profits, one of which is the milk plant. When I was a boy, the city of Omaha was supplied by farmers who milked their own cows, hauled their milk to town, and peddled it. Now the city of Omaha is supplied quite differently. The farmers who supply it yve farther out. Their milk is trucked into town and taken to the central plant where it is clarified, pasteurized and bottled, and from where it is delivered. By owning our own milk plant, we can take this profit for the farmer. That cuts the seven down to six. If this plant makes money — and it should, and it does — it belongs to the farmer. Another thing we have accomplished — which I think all milk pro - ducers' associations do accomplish if worthy of the name — is to improve the quality of the milk in our territory. If you have a plant of your own, and one of your number in control comes to you and says, "Your milk is inferior in quality; it Is dirty, and has a high bacterial count— We found a small fish in it the other day! — you are going to improve the quality of the milk sooner than if the criticism same from some stranger who had bought your milk. So the farmers' co-operative association can im - prove the product that is put out. There is nothing more perishable than milk, which can be damaged in a few hours. It is several hours from the milk pail to the plant. We h.ive improved the quality. </seg>
            <seg id="p063">! NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION 64 I was talking to a gentleman in Omaha who said, "While I admit it is better, I cannot see as you have cheapened it a bit." I said, "My dear brother, I don't see that the Implement Dealers' Association has cheapened the price of plows." Primarily, our purpose is not to lower the cost. While we have cheapened the milk, we have not done it at the cost of the farmer. Practically all of the milk was distributed from house to house by the milk wagon before we went into the business. We have popularized the sale of milk at the groceries. The grocers have sold more milk in Lin - coln than in Omaha in times past. If the grocer sells it, he can deliver it with the groceries without any additional cost. We have increased the sale of milk at the grocery stores immensely, cutting off another of the profits between producer and consumer. It is a bard job to put a farmers' milk plant on a paying basis. I be - lieve the co-operative concern has a harder row to hoe than the privately owned enterprise. One reason for this Is the fact there are too many bosses. Everybody has his own pet notion of how a co-operative enter - prise of any kind should be run, and all want to take a hand in it. A co-operative enterprise sometimes suffers from its friends in that way, but they have been good to me in Omaha. Then again, the co-operative enterprise is expected to fail, which makes it lots harder to succeed than if everyone expected you to succeed. That is psychology, isn't it? It is so, anyway. Yesterday a gentleman whom I called up said, "I have heard several places that the Midwest is going into bankruptcy. Is it so?" "No!" They prophesied we were going into bankruptcy the first of January, but we did not do it, and we won't. We made a nice profit during De - cember. • There is another thing we have done. We have helped immensely those farmers who do not sell to us, as well as those who do. I said to a man the other day — a competitor with whom I am on speaking terms: "They have me on the program- of the Organized Agri - cultural meeting to tell what the farmers' milk plant can do. What can it do?" He said, "I can't think of a thing." "Haven't we made you pay more for milk?' "You have furnished competition." In Omaha our competitors have a standing offer of one cent per gallon more than the Midwest price, whatever it is. That is where we help the man who is not in the Midwest. The men who won't do a thing for us, benefit in spite of us. So it goes through the whole world. The great Savior of the world helped everyone in spite of himself, and because of the Christian religion the world is a better place to live, in spite of, </seg>
            <seg id="p064">THIRTY-SIXTH ANNUAL CONVENTION 65 or because of. your life or mine. But we have made real competition for the organized milk buyers. We have -made a sure market. Just now there is an over-production of milk. It is something you can sell during hard times. You can get cash for it. It is about the only thing a few farmers are selling just now. They are trying to hold their hogs and wheat and corn. They are keeping the grocer paid and the children in shoes with the money they get for their milk. Milk cows are about the only thing in Nebraska today there is any market for. We have a big production of milk. There is a surplus I know of one Omaha creamery that closed down a station out in the State receiving four hundred gallons of milk a day. They have no place to sell it. Their buyer at another station close to Omaha is offering more than we are for milk. Has the farmers' milk plant done anything for the farmers? I will leave that to you. There are older paints than ours scattered over the whole United States, with managers I look up to. A gentleman said to me, "Whether I could get a cent more for my milk or not, if I can have my milk weighed and tested by a representa - tive of my own organization, it would be worth the cost of the stock." We offer those facilities. The Midwest has a rule any farmer is per - fectly welcome — in fact, we are glad to have him take his milk anywhere to test it and compare with our test. We are open and above-board. I am not saying our competitors are not. We can provide a market for the surplus. We are taking the milk from the station that has been closed by our competitor. Why? Because those farmers are members of our Association, and we are going to take care of them. If the surplus must be sold at a loss, you have produced it, and if you are willing to take that loss", it is your own business 1 . We are maintaining a better market for the demands of the city be - cause we take care of and absorb this over-production. We are taking the milk from this station in the State, and we do not know* yet what we are going to pay for it. The way we do business is this: We operate for a month. Then at the monthly meeting of the Board of Directors, the cost of operation is subtracted from the total receipts, and the amount left — after deducing a cerain per cent as a sinking fund to provide against a rainy day — is divided among the farmers according to the amount of milk they sell us. If we have a demand for every drop of milk at a profitable price, we can pay a good price. If not, and we have to send a lot of the milk back to the farmers after taking the butter fat out of it, we do not give so much. We always have been able to pay as much as our competitors. In the future we will be able to pay considerably more, because we are learning - the business and getting so we can "play the game." </seg>
            <seg id="p065">NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION 66 These farmers own the milk plant. Why not? The railroads think they should own the coal mines because it enables them to run more profitably. I will tell you, boys, if you take your corn to market you get so much for it. If you feed it to cows and produce the milk, you should get more for it. If you take the milk to town and put it into milk bottles, you should get still more for it. I was very much interested in Mr. Borland's talk this morning. He spoke about improving the dairyman. He said he believed there was no need to improve the dairymen who are here today. You men are the wide-awake dairymen or you would not be here. One of the greatest missions of the Midwest Milk Producers' Associa - tion is to go out to the farmer on the farm and help him to improve his methods. We can get him interested in a milk plant when we could net get him interested in a technical talk. We buy his milk. He has some - thing invested in our plant, and he comes into our office and wants to know why he is not getting more. We can tell him. He wants to know why he is not making more money, and we can tell him why. We have a chance to spread the gospel among the more conservative farmers in a way that our brothers in college do not have. I thank you, gentlemen. (Applause.) QUESTIONAIRE Answers by Mr. Frazeur Q. Can we have a plant in Lincoln? A. I was talking to Mr. Grey about it, and I told him I understood the size of the job it is to build a plant. You must have money. You must get it out of the farmers. If a brother farmer goes to them with a proposition, they think he wants to sell them a gold brick. It is a task for some man who is willing to do a lot of work and get no pay for it. Yes, you can build a plant -here and make it pay. Q. Did you talk about private plants for each individual farmer? A. I did not say anything about that. Q. Is anything like that practical? A. Individual circumstances have to govern that. If you are on the edge of town with a herd of cows and ten or twelve boys and want to keep them at work, you might do it. It was not practical for me with my farm. THE PRESIDENT: It is the great pleasure of he afternoon to me to be able to present to this Association a man who is nationally known as a speaker, and especially as a speaker in the interest of the dairy business — Hon. D. D. Aitken. President of the National Holstein Friesian Association of America. (Applause.) </seg>
            <seg id="p066">THIRTY-SIXTH ANNUAL CONVENTION 67 Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: You know it would take a person a week, really, to talk with you about all the different things that come to his mind as he hears the arguments advanced here about the condition existing in Nebraska. Why, you know it makes a fellow feel as though he must have been misled about the conditions in Nebraska. Out here where you have a depth of soil that has never been measured, and where you get the raw material for plant food from the soil without stint, still you are blue and you are having a desperate time to make ends meet and to get along; and you wonder, after all, whether there is any - thing in this business of farming and animal husbandry. Do you know that the per capita of wealth of the people of Nebraska is about twice as high as the average in the United States? And when you are bemoaning your lot, folks, do you ever think about the other fellow? Why is it in a city where they pay a higher wage than any place in the world, when they ceased manufacturing a little while ago, there were 40 per cent of the people not sixty days from the bread line? And I don't hear half so much howling about poverty and distress as you do in these states of Iowa and Nebraska. Those fellows will go to the picture show twice a day now, and they could only go once. But they have a different viewpoint than you people who till the soil. I want to say to you' folks that farming is just what you make it. You are engaged in practically the only absolutely essential Industry under the sun. (Applause.) And if you can not make as great a success of it as can the manufacturer or producer of luxuries, then you must be a bum lot! Let us forget all about that sort of thing. I tell you you don't know anything about the condition throughout the country. I was talking to a fellow who made shoes and got sixteen dollars a pair for them six months ago, in Massachusetts. He said to me, "This is tough business!" "Yes, it is. You should always be able to get sixteen dollars a pair." He said, "I lost $150,000 on what leather I had on hand this last drop on leather when the factories closed down." In that town where he lived there were one hundred and one factories where they were making shoes, and they all closed down. Those men were all out of a job. Those merchants had their shelves loaded down with goods bought at a high price, and they were marking them down as little as they could at a time, but they were marking them down and taking the loss and bearing it, whether they were grinning or not. Those fellows were up against the real thing out there. I was at a directors' meeting when we decided' the merchants who had those big stocks of goods on hand whose credit was based on the amount of stock they carried, would have to reduce their credit at the ADDRESS Hon. D. D. Aitken, Flint, Michigan </seg>
            <seg id="p067">68 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION bank equal to the difference between what their goods were worth six months ago when the credit was extended, and what they could replace them for now. That has been true all over this land. That is why you are seeing so many reduced sales. They have been called. You had a tremendous loss out here, too. In Iowa a year ago they showed me some farms sold for $600 an acre — ordinary looking farms with ordinary buildings. They asked me what I though about it. I said, "I think any man is an ass to think he can make good returns out of a $600 an acre farm." The farmers were not averse to taking the profits, notwithstanding they were excessive. So we are all alike, after all. (Applause.) Let me tell you something I satisfied my mind on some time ago. This question of price is a mental condition. You can go along and see a thing all the time, and you do not see it unless it is registered in your mind. It is the mind that governs these things. Land or milk is worth just what you think it is worth and what you mentally value it at. Will you producers tell me what you have ever said about your milk that would convey to anybody's mind there was any special value in it, or any reason why they should buy it at a profitable price? Did you ever hear of anybody else having something to sell who never spoke well of it himself, and who discarded it and took a substitute, excepting the farmers and the dairymen? I was connected somewhat with the Administration when we were attempting to get an increase to feed the soldiers' of France and England and America. It came up before the Hoover Committee in Washington. The question was how the government was going to get butter for the soldiers and butter to preserve from death the childhood of France and England and Poland, because without this butter fat childhood cannot live, and without it there is no growth in the child — this product of yours they say has an over-production. The question came up, How was this matter going to be handled? There were a great number of persons interested in the dairy business. Mr. Hoover was presiding. He said, "Now, gentlemen, this is up to you. You represent the dairy industry of America, and I want to know how we are going to get this butter?" They said, "Go out in the market and buy it. You must pay for it. The dairymen are coming into their own." He said, "What do you say about this, Aitken?" I told him I considered too high a price was just as dangerous as too low, and if I were representing the government, I would fix a reas - onable price, and every time it dropped below I would step .in and buy, and maintain the price. Every one said, "You can't buy it at too high a price. Go on and buy your butter and we will assume the responsi - bility." Do you remember when 40 per cent of all the butter was command - eered? It was the result of that meeting. Butter went to a dollar a pound. </seg>
            <seg id="p068">THIRTY-SIXTH ANNUAL CONVENTION 69 I I do not think it would apply to you people in Nebraska, but 1 talked to the Dairymen's convention of New York not many months after, and asked for all who were present who went out and bought oleo when butter went to a dollar a pound, to rise, and nobody rose. What was the use of having such a condition as that? They did not even have the condition of their own mind when they valued their own product at a dollar a pound. That is the condition of the dairy industry. The people of the city think more of your product than you do yourselves, and the per capita consumption of the dairy products is higher in the cities than in the country in the United States where it is produced. Still we are chewing the rag because the business in on the bowwows! This is one of the cases when "Charity begins at home." We want to educate ourselves and find out something about what we are making. How many of you people know that milk is an all-around food; that it is, with the oil in the yolk of the egg, the only food for the young that contains vitamines that mean growth in the child? How many of you know that the want of sufficient milk in childhood is the cause of 40 per cent of the mortality of the little children in the United States of America? Then we talk about an over production of milk! If you have never studied up this problem yourselves, how do you expect the people in the city to become interested in your product? Why should they? We make automobiles in the town where I live. You never thought we were partially diffident about telling you why you should buy them, or why they were valuable and necessary. And you bought them, and you did not raise a discussion of whether it was "cost of production plus a reasonable profit." Bet your life it was a reasonable profit! We got you in a condition of mind where you wanted the automobile, and we got you where we could produce it and make a very reasonable profit. (Applause.) There was a change came over the spirit of your dreams. All of a sudden you stopped buying, not only automobiles, but everything else under the sun. That is absolute proof that in the final analysis the con - sumer fixes the price. The greed of the man who had his labor to sell was as great as the greed of any person in all this combination of waste. I am somewhat interested in banks, and I was telling the President of one of the big banks in Detroit that the pirate of profiteering was the banker who paid 3 per cent on savings and loaned at 8 per cent. The fellow who earned the money received 3 per cent for what he had earned, and the banker was getting 8 per cent by taking it in and loan - ing it to the other fellow. That bank President was talking to the Rotary Club and deploring the fact the retail merchants did not reduce </seg>
            <seg id="p069">70 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION their prices so that people would buy! We can all see the other fel - low's faults, but It is no idle Job to pick out any virtues in him. CAp - plause.) This is great business — this farming and dairying. There is no business 1 under the sun that requires as much brains and grey matter as your business, and no business under the sun where there has been so little brains exerted. (Applause.) We as farmers 1 have a sort of prejudice against mental exercise. Do you know the brain that remains dormant is just like your muscles that are not exercised? If you do not use them, they get out of practice and do not function. We have been trying to run this farm and dairy business by main strength. You won't win out. Dairymen are using machinery for producing milk and dairy pro - ducts. Think of it. Here is one of tiie most perfect that has ever come out of the world — this perfect milking machine that produces over thirteen hundred pounds of butter in a year, and has taken into that machine tons and tons of alfalfa, corn, ensilage, roots, and bran, and cotton s'eed meal. They have gone through that wonderful mechanism and have been brought out a finished product — the most perfect and the only one absolutely essential to human life. Yet you think any ordinary cuss can operate that machine. (Applause.) I tell you he can't do it. You might just as well realize it one time as another. I could not help but think of it on the picture there about what the condition was in Pennsylvania. Mind you, the Professor was showing you the results of the best herds, because they are the ones that have cow testing associations. I can remember some years ago we were going to have a county agent in our county. I was operating 1 a farm for glory, and practicing law to keep the farm going. (Laughter.) I thought a county agent would be great stuff, because I could find out a lot from him about what the other fellows were doing. I went in with three of four others and we guaranteed the salary of the county agent. We thought we could go out among the farmers and they would chip in enough to pay his salary. We kept him a year. I think it cost the five of us $210 a piece to make up for what the farmers did not think a county agent was worth. That was one of the first experiences I had of the interest the farmers generally take in improving their condition. Perhaps one farmer to whom I talked was typical of his class in that county at that time. "Well," he said, "do you think one of them boiled-shirt chaps from college can tell me how to run a farm? I guess not! I have farmed here all my life, and I don't propose to have some kid come from college and tell me something." (Laughter.) Let us see about the college. You have here the most perfect build - ing I have ever seen in my life — the Dairy Building. (Applause.) The man had genius and knew the essentials for the dairy industry when he planned this building and carried it out. He is making fame </seg>
            <seg id="p070">THIRTY-SIXTH ANNUAL CONVENTION 71 for you people of Nebraska, but you thought some other fellow could do It just as well tor twelve dollars a month, and so they are going to let him go and get a cheaper man. We have been doing that in Michigan. I do not know whether we will have any college or not after a while, and we are the oldest one in America. Brain is at a disadvantage in a great many ways, and no more so than" in our institutions of learning. Here you have seen the practical effects of good education — good training. But you know I have seen some of the greatest absurdities perpetrated on the public by professors I ever saw in my life. I would rather give this Professor who is working out your problems $10,000 a year, than to give some professors I know of $10 a year. (Applause.) That is the same way with us all. They say up around Flint where I live our boys are getting a dollar an hour in the automobile plants. They have to quit farming and dairying because the farmers and dairy - men can't pay the wage. The boys have gone to the cities. The aver - age age of the men on the farms of Michigan is fifty-three years, or it wa3 six months ago; but the boys are all back now. (Applause.) The factories closed down and they had spent their money as they went, and some of them have sacrificed a good deal of their cleanliness and good health as 1 they went, and they are back with dad. They don't feel nearly as flip about the prospects of next year with the low price of milk and dairy products and corn and wheat and oats, as they did. They don't feel the same, because they don't know when the blooming factories are going to start in again! When up there, they were only hired men, because those great in - stitutions that employed forty thousand of them did not even have a lo - cal owner there. He lived in New York. They could just as well put in a new wheel in the thing and it would operate Just the same. He did not know a thing more at night than in the morning, nor at the end of the month than he knew at the beginning. He was simply a little inconsequential cog that was working out the problem of producing automobiles. He stood in line as they started those machines in at one end of the long factory, on a little truck. These fellows were all lined up, and the genius of our farmer boy was exercised to turn a nut as it passed by, and another fellow was running in a rivet. He got so he could screw in a nut in a hurry, but he had to. The more expert he be - came, the more he could earn. But it is not running now because you farmers are not buying automobiles these days. I want to say to you if you want your boy to be a proprietor, the only way is to keep him on the farm. He may go into this business you are all so sick of, or he can go into the city as the other boys did, and you may have to take care of him when the factory closes. If he is married and has any children, you will probably have the whole bunch of them. Now let us look at this proposition. If you could see as much of it as I do in all its phases, you would come to appreciate the opportunities </seg>
            <seg id="p071">72 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION Nature and Providence have given you. Why, men, you waste more on the farms of Iowa and Nebraska than the entire product of the soil of New England, because they have had to be frugal and saving. You are to the industry just what those fellows are in those cities — extrava - gant and wasteful. It does not look so to you, but jt looks so to the Yankee in New England. Down where I am living, conditions are just as much worse than here as you can imagine. Burlington is the largest city in Vermont, and has 20,000 people. When I was there before this war and everything was- in normal condi - tion, they had $21,000,000 in the savings banks in that city, and 80 per cent of it has been taken out of the granite hills by the fellows working and tilling that little bit of shallow soil as it ran up on the side of those mountains until they were practically bare. That is what they had been doing. If they put in tobacco, they had to feed those tobacco plants; if corn, they had to feed that corn. Nature did not store up in their soil plant food. Under those conditions, they had more than a million dollars to every thousand of population in the savings banks in Burlington. The savings banks in the city where I live, with three and one-half times the population of Burlington, Vermont, did not have as much money in savings, and they pay out more wages to labor where I live than in the whole State of Vermont! It is the way we are constituted and brought up that helps to work out these problems. I don't want to hear that a man from Nebraska is guilty of saying, it is not worth while to farm in Nebraska, or it is not worth while to be engaged in the dairy industry, because I will be thoroughly convinced in my mind if I hear viat kind of talk, you will be a good deal like the fellow in Arkansas. There was a fellow who was Secretary of the Board of Commerce. He was President of a plant that was manufacturing spokes for the automobiles up in Flint. He wanted me to talk to their Board of Com - merce. I said, "I don't think they would enjoy hearing me talk to them." But he said, "You must come over. They must get some of this self-satisfaction out of them before I can accomplish anything down here in Pine Bluff." I went up, and the merchants and bankers were there, and even the professional men. It was very stylish and really in good taste to belong to that Board of Commerce, and you have a chance to get into the best society in that town if you run a bank or are a professional man. Mer - chants 1 stand fairly well, but the bankers and professional men are the best part of the community. A large number of them were there. They asked me to tell them what I though they needed down there. I said, "Well, I had better tell you what appeals to me. I have driven about a good deal, and I find away down in the black land a colored man at work. He is raising cotton. He deals with the settler </seg>
            <seg id="p072">THIRTY-SIXTH ANNUAL CONVENTION 73 who has a place down there where he furnishes those negroes, and red ecks working with the colored fellows, their groceries', and charges hem a fair profit. I think about 2 or 3 per cent a month is the in - erest he charges. He buys his stuff of some of the wholesale grocers p here, and you charge him a reasonable profit. You only charge lim 1% per cent a month for the money until he pays it to you after the egro has sold his 1 cotton. You bankers loan to these wholesale grocers nd only charge them 1 per cent a month pending the time the negro markets his cotton and the settler gets his money and pays the whole - ale grocer, and he in turn refunds to you. "You are having a pretty good time — the whole bunch of you. But the negro is the only fellow who did any work. "I will ask you this question: Haven't you the best soil there is anywhere, here in Arkansas?" "Yes, sir; of course we have." Haven't you as good a climate for production as anywhere?' "Yes, sir; of course we have." b"Then what in the devil do you think is the matter? If you have and climate, there is only one thing more necessary for success in iculture, and that is the man; and you fellows all seem to be here." kYou folks are not waiting for some one to come from the north and I you what is the trouble. You have been setting the pace here in braska, Do you know what made Nebraska and Minnesota and Wisconsin and Michigan and these northern states great? It was the little country school house that made all this country. I never dreamed it until the war was on. Some twelve of fifteen years, ago, the Durant Carriage Company, len the greatest carriage builders in the world, had some large interests n the south where they were making parts of their vehicles 1 . They ad a carriage plant at Atlanta, Georgia. They decided I should dispose f all the plants of the corporation in the south. I went to Atlanta. They had several stockholders. I went into the office of their principal tockholders to induce them to buy the stock. We had several meetings, nd I met their father, an old man eighty years' of age. He had been a member of Jeff Davis' cabinet. He had been out raising money for the ublic schools of Georgia by subscription, and subscribed a million dollars imself. He said, "Mr. Aitken, what do you think makes the difference between the north and the south?" "I haven't an idea, unless it is because your climate does not gener - ate energy." . "You are wrong about it. Let me tell you. It is the little country school that has made America, great, and you people have had the ad - vantage of it, and we have not. There are no country schools in the south." </seg>
            <seg id="p073">74 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION That was news to me. I never thought any more of it. When the war was on I wasl going over to Chicago in a Pullman, and a Colonel who lives at Port Huron, who was in charge of a cantonment in eastern Kentucky, was in the car with me. He had been in the English army, having engaged in the war before the United States entered the con - test. When the United States declared war, the English General sent for three colonels and said, "You can serve this cause and your country to better advantage by going home and training the soldiers than by remaining here. I want you to go home. You will be granted a fur - lough. If your people want you, notify me and you will be honorably discharged from the English service." So they came home, and this 1 Colonel was selected to take charge of this cantonment down there. The most appalling thing of it all is the fact 85 per cent of those stalwart boys cannot read or write! Think of that in the United States of America! Wasn't that the diff - erence, and isn't it the difference, and won't it always be the difference between the person whose mind is trained and the person who never has any conception of mental exertion or effort? I am satisfied that grand old man of Georgia understood what he was talking about when he made that as the distinction between the success of the north and the condition at that time in the south, which has gradually improved since then. We have these problems, and we might just as well consider them from practical standpoint one time as another. They say you are en - titled to cost of production and a reasonable profit. I think that is all pure buncombe! That was what the government thought when it went to buying stuff. You know what the result was. The manufacturers hired a lot of extra fellows' and raised their wages, because when they paid a man six dollars a day they got sixty cents, and if they paid five dollars, they only got fifty cents. Everything the government bought cost two or three prices, because it was bought on that basis. You would not want this country to adopt any such system. In the Buick plant before the war they had an arrangement whereby a certain number of men could finish ten bodies a day in one of their departments. They paid those men at that time forty cents an hour. Since profiteering in labor has reached its limit, they have paid a dollar an hour and they only finish seven jobs, instead of ten. Suppose they had been paying "cost plus?" Supposing you had some of those cows that were making three thousand pounds of milk a year and you were hiring some fellows for fifty cents an hour to take care of them, and feeding into their old hoppers good, valuable food, and the people had to pay you 10 per cent above the cost of that stuff, wouldn't that be a rotten business on people generally? I say to you you are only entitled to make profit on the things you manufacture in a reasonable, orderly, efficient way. When you keep a cow that only gives three thousand pounds of milk a year, instead </seg>
            <seg id="p074">THIRTY-SIXTH ANNUAL CONVENTION 75 of having a profit, it should have ninety days in the sewer! (Applause.) Yet all the cows in Nebraska do not average so very much over four thousand pounds Still we are wondering why there isn't any profit in the business. I want to say to you and want you to realize and appreciate that there are not 10 per cent of the people of the United States 1 who are competent to work out their own salvation. They are not competent to be the architects of their own fortunes. There are not 10 per cent of the people- of the United States who leave a thousand dollars for their fam - ilies when they die. What right have we to expect people everywhere are competent to work out these problems? We must realize which group we belong to — whether the 10 per cent or the 90 per cent. So far as pure bred live stock dairying is concerned, the youngest of you will not live to see the time when 10 per cent of the milk of the United States is produced from pure bred dairy cows, because you can only get a few each year. The Holstein-Friesian cow has one calf a year. Half the time it is a heifer, so you may add only half as many as. you have cows, less those that die. I estimated there were 150.000 four years ago. There are probably 225,000 now. You might get 110,000 from those each year. That is the only source from which you will ever get pure breds. These grades are improved milking machines. But there are a lot of ways you can improve the ones you have. When the Professor said there were registered scrubs, he did uot make any mistake. The registered scrub is training under false colors, and so is the man who sells him if he knows what he is when he makes the sale. (Applause.) We might just as well realize one time as another it is a mighty important problem when you go into pure bred livestock breeding. You are associating yourselves with a lot of men whose reputations are hinging on your conduct, and if you do not expect to be square, you are doing an injustice to the other men. I want to say for the Holstein-Friesian Association, that it has only contempt for the trickster or cow jockey, whether he is jockeying Hol - stein-Friesian cows or whether they are scrubs or grades. (Applause.) This is my theory about the breed people should handle: I believe if you are producing beef, you want a machine for producing beef. It would cost you 50 per cent more per hundred to produce beef from scrubs than from beef-bred animals. You could not expect to get a reasonable profit on a cost of producing beef iC you were going to use that dairy machine. You might just as well say you could not make money raising wheat because you could not get fellows to cradle it. That dairy scrub was in use when we did cradle it. I used to bind after a cradle with a rake by hand. It is no great credit to us as farmers and dairymen that we are not still using the old cradle. The machines' which took its place were all invented by these "blasted monopolies" — these companies in the city </seg>
            <seg id="p075">76 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION that are grinding out our life blood. They brought them around and sold them to us because we could not afford not to use them. I was In Germany twelve years ago in July. I had a binder operat - ing on the farm and was paying two dollars a day. Within ten days' I was in southern Germany, and four men and three women were doing the same work that man was doing. They were paying the men two marks, and the women one mark a day. I said to a German who could speak English, "Why do they do it?" "Oh, their argument is these fellows must be kept at work anyway. and if they had that machinery, it would do away with a lot of jobs for these fellows." I wonder if that is the reason we are keeping these beastly scrubs? (Laughter.) We could produce this extra milk from half the number of good machines and there would not be as much work for us to do with only half the number of cows to take care of. Think of the eco - nomic argument connected with such a proposition. I said, "Why don't you get a machine and set these fellows to doing something else?" If you do not think you can make money on the farm, you had better quit it. There is no use of a man's working on the farm if he does not like it. If you are going to continue it, you want to be a credit to the business. You must realize it is the most honorable business under the sun. (Applause.) Your boys are going to be better men because they are raised on the farm. The best men in all the factories today were raised on the farm. The greatest lawyers and physicians of this country were raised on the farm. Why? Because of the industry of their youth, very largely. It is industry — labor — that represents everything. Lots of it must be mental. Your minds should be educated so that they can be properly exercised and so that they can function. We have strange spectacles. One of the things that irritates me more than anything else is to have some galoot extending sympathy to the farmers. That gets on my nerves. Extending sympathy to people because they are engaged in agriculture — because they are feeding the people! Are we entitled to sympathy? They have kept it up so long most of us believe it is true. We believe they are going to legislate down at Washington some price in wheat; that they are going to work out our salvation down there and make it profitable to operate a farm. I think it is the poorest bun - combe of the whole business. If our business is not profitable, there is no excuse for us to stay in it. If it is not honorable, there is no reason why we should follow it. We ought to have too much pride to listen to sympathy and pity from people whose chief interest is to capture our votes, because if they know enough to represent us, they should have brains enough to know if there is any salvation for the farmers, they must work it out themselves. If they use the most economical way of producing their food, there is not any reason why they should not make it successful and profitable, </seg>
            <seg id="p076">THIRTY-SIXTH ANNUAL CONVENTION 77 or any possibility of a doubt but what it will be profitable. Just so long as you use inferior machinery and have this product cost you twice as much as it should cost, there is not any excuse on earth for you getting a profit on it, nor any reason why the consumer should be saddled with the cost. I have been in New England spending four or five weeks with the Yankees. Down in Massachusetts, with its patriotism and learning, and culture so classical it is almost a cloud wherever you go, they require a cow to give not less than 3.35 per cent of fat, or else the farmer can't sell her. liy legislative enactment they are going to compel cows to give the same right along! Every man who knows anything about it, knows a cow might give 3 per cent one day and 5 per cent the next. You would have to sell 3.7 per cent milk in order to get 12 per cent solids. In Rhode Island they say you cannot sell milk unless it contains 2\b per cent fat and 12 per cent solids; so the only way is to get milk powder and make it up. In Ohio — the State of presidents — the Buckeye State — they have us all skinned to a frazzle on this proposition of legislation. You do not need to have cream in your ice cream in Ohio. The fire does not affect ice cream in Ohio. (Laughter.) It does not melt in the summer time. Yet Ohio is one of the greatest dairy states in the Union. They say they have some big combinations down there that control the legislature and won't let them enact a law requiring a certain amount of fat in ice cream. • Ice cream is the most popular food known, because it is the most likable and the most healthful of any of the foods of the dairy produc - tion. There is not anything in the world that could so take up our slack or all production of milk as could ice cream. Yet here is a State in the center of the Union that does not require them to put any cream in it! • I was in New Jersey lately. If Rhode Island had succeeded in seced - ing from the United States because of the Eighteenth amendment, I sup - pose New Jersey would have gone with her. When I was there, within sixty miles of ten million people, I saw hundreds of bushels of peaches rotting on the ground. I saw hundreds and hundreds of wagons' loaded with tomatoes being drawn to the docks and shipped to Baltimore for canning at twenty-five cents a bushel. Yet I paid on a dining car of the Pennsylvania Road that went right through there, thirty cents for one of them sliced up. (Laughter.) Over in the city of Detroit not long ago I was going to the depot of the Michigan Central. At my own farm we had a lot of fall apples. I told the man to invite anybody he knew to come and get them, be - cause we had not anyone to pick them. He said. "Most of the fellows will ruin the trees." He offered them to two or three, and they would not come for them. I saw some of them sold for seventy-five cents a bushel in Detroit. When I got down to the Michigan Central station, </seg>
            <seg id="p077">NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION 78 ■ out of curiosity I asked what they sold for and they said, "Eight cents apiece; two for fifteen." Isn't it an intelligent distributing system we have? Do you know what will cure it all? Education and publicity. Do you think those people would have asked fifteen cents for two apples if everybody who went into those buildings knew they could get them for nothing in the orchard? Do you think the Pennsylvania System would have charged thirty cents for sliced tomatoes if the management knew everybody knew they could buy them for twenty-five cents a bushel? Do you think the peaches would have lain rotting in New Jersey if people who had auto - mobiles' had known about it? No. What do you suppose they would think about your blooming milk if they knew what it was worth? You have heard about the McCormack Foundation — a fund in memory of the wife of one of the McCormack's. They send out boys suffering from malnutrition to the farm, and try to resuscitate them. There was a boy came up there to be examined and see if he could get a cer - tificate to go to work, and the doctors said he was in bad condition. They sent him out onto the farm. That boy was 40 per cent below nor - mal physically and mentally when they took him out. They brought him back in thirteen weeks absolutely normal. He had gained twenty-four pounds. The doctors pronounced him physically fit for anything, and nothing was given him but milk. That is this product you are produc - ing. You people never tell anything about it. One of the reasons why you should all join your co-operative effort to market your milk is to show you have some idea as to the neces - sity of being efficient. Think of requiring distributors to chase all over the country and sign up every Tom, Dick and Harry. They lie to every one, because they tell him they are paying him more than anyone else. They will always have favorites, and every fellow thinks he is "it." Look at the waste! You should have it so the distributor could go to your man and get the milk. If you exercised grey matter, he would not be able to get any milk unless he got it of your man. Instead of trying to put up the price, purify the supply and do away with all unsanitary conditions, and tell the mothers of little children the value of it; and keep telling them. Tell the people about the cures of consumption in this country. There are a hundred places in America where they use milk to cure consumption, and use nothing else. Take any case of tuberculosis in its early stages, put the person to bed and give him large quantities of milk and it will so aid Nature as to overcome the disease. Persist, and the patient is 1 cured of tuberculosis. That Is this milk of yours. I want to say to you, instead of having an over-supply of milk, you have had an under-sized effort in selling' your product or in teaching the people its value. </seg>
            <seg id="p078">thirty-Sixth annual convention 79 If" Herbert Hoover would say to the mothers of the United States, "Women. I am trying to get milk for the children of Europe, but you are not feeding half as much as you ought to do in the United States. Feed the children not less than a quart of milk a day; they are not no* getting a pint." What would be the result? You could not supply the milk any more than you could fly. Still you could increase your milk in thirty days by properly feeding your milking machines. If you don't do some of those things, you have no one to blame for not having made a success of it. You could discard one-third of all the cows being milked in the State of Nebraska, and feed the ones you retained one-half of what the others were eating in addition to what you have been feeding, and you would get as much milk as you get now from the whole bunch, and it would cost you less per hundred pounds. I wish I knew what I could do to tell everybody about this College you have here. The taxpayers of Nebraska paid for this. What percent - age do you think of the people of Nebraska know anything about it? Do you think 5 per cent of the people know anything about what you are doing at Agricultural College or at your University? Do you think they are not interested in it? Why, friends, the people of Nebraska have to be sold the idea of the Agricultural College before you accomplish anything. They must sell Ihe idea of the University of Nebraska before you get the most out of it. Then you may expect them to take advantage of these institutions. Out here under your present administration there are quite a number o£ people who know what you have been doing at this College, but in nine-tenths of the agricultural colleges of the United States, and of the Federal Department of Agriculture, there is not one - half of one per cent of the people know what they have been doing. They won't let the newspapers have it before it % is sent out in bulletins, and they won't publish it afterwards. I would spend $50,000 advertising this institution. I would let every man, woman and child in Nebraska know what kind of an institution you have hers, and they would want to have their boys and girls come to it; and you should have twice as many as you do. What an outrage so few have the use of this great expenditure! I am here to represent the Holstein-Friesian Association, and I forgot all about it. (Laughter.) If dairying is not worth while, and you are dairymen, then there is no use for the Holstein-Friesian milking machines. If the dairy industry is worth while, folks, and you make a success of it, I will take a chance on your buying the best milking machines to turn out your product. (Applause.) I want to thank you for your attention, and to bid you Good Bye. (Applause.) THE PRESIDENT: I think after this splendid address of Mr. Ait - ken's, some of you, at least, will think a little bit more of Nebraska and of the dairy cow; and I do not know what to say you will think of your- </seg>

But I do know this: that the man who goes away from this hall this afternoon will be determined In his operations in the future, he will think more of himself than previous to this time. I remember hearing a little incident given by a man who was trying to show to Ne - braska people how little they appreciate their opportunities here. He said that if those westerners had the soil we have in Nebraska, they would put it in a bottle and sell it. They talk about what they do. A gravel bank you would turn over to a railroad, they would pour a little water on and sell for a thousand dollars an acre! We need a little hit of that kind of inspiration in our dairy business. I am sure Mr. Aitken has given us a splendid foundation upon which to build it. "FEEDING THE DAIRY COW" Professor J. W. Hendrickson, Lincoln, Nebraska The subject assigned to me was, "Feeding the Dairy Cow." I have diverted from that, and in one way I have been sorry I did so. The sub - ject I have chosen has been discussed several times today. What I have been working on is the feed cost of production. The little data I have to give is taken from the Nebraska herds. Mr. Borland told you of Pennsylvania conditions. We have heard from time to time a great many discussions on the cost of producing milk. They have come from various sources. There is one faction that is attemptiong to prove the dairyman is getting the lion's share. There is another faction who- attempts to prove you can - not produce milk and get a profit. The man who buys a bottle of milk and pound of butter may get the notion the dairyman is getting a fair profit on these products. The scientific dairyman knows dairying is one of the most complicated businesses, which requires expert knowledge, and there is no other profession which requires the exactness of that of the dairy industry. It is because of those conditions and the conflicting ideas that I have chosen to take our own herd and give a little survey of some things we have been doing which cover a five-year period, from January 1, 1915, to January 1, 1920. I have taken every cow we have had that produced milk for eight months or more. I made the record from January to Jan - uary, for I believe the business man is interested in that kind of a propo - sition. He is conducting his business and conducting his industry just as the business man is making his invoice at the last of the year. Our income tax reports are forcing us to take an inventory at this time. The summaries are not abnormal. When I give the records, some of them will appear to be a little lower than some averages taken out. The ration we have given to this herd varies somewhat year by year. It has been based upon the prin - ciple of economy as much as anything else. Each of these rations has secured good results, I have the records of changes, and they have been </seg>
            <seg id="p080">THIRTY-SIXTH ANNUAL CONVENTION 81 made almost entirely in the interest of economy, our object being to keep a balanced ration which would be as economical as possible. With the test cows, economy has not always been the deciding fac - tor. We have tried to get the greatest production possible by honest means. We have supplied them with variety, and have added to their feed barley and oats and other things to give variety, with the under - standing the cow will consume more food and return more milk for the amount she is consuming. Regarding the herd, there are 27 different Hoistein cows, represent - ing 77 yearly lacteal periods. These cows average production is 10,304 pounds. The average of the cows in fat production is 607 pounds. The average production of our Jersey herd, with 30 cows represent - ing 79 lacteal periods, is 6,386 pounds of milk, and 340 pounds of butter fat. We have a Guernsey group of 6 cows, with 6,090 pounds as the average of milk, and 316 pounds of fat. We have a few Ayrshires, with an average of 7,732 pounds of milk and 305 pounds of fat. The milking Shorthorns perhaps would come nearer the average cow than any of the others. They produced on an average 4,286 pounds of milk, and 177 pounds of fat. The average of the entire group of dairy animals, representing 198 animal units, was 7,831 pounds of milk, and 416 pounds of butter. Against that we have the milking Shorthorn, which produce 4,200 pounds of milk and 221 pounds of butter fat. My story would not be complete if I did not give you the food costs of that.

            <seg id="p081">82 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION There are a great many different views that might be taken. Some will say, "This was the State Experiment, Station herd. You have not the same conditions we have." That is true. I have not applied the same conditions. In talking with one man, he took this attitude: "Any investigation which you make is absolutely time wasted. It does not tell you anything." He gave as his reason that his farm is producing and putting into the production of milk the waste forage that is valueless. He thought the farmer should be pleased to get anything for his milk, because it was clear profit. I have heard of conditions where the farmer would be unreasonable. We have given the amount of food required to produce 100 pounds of milk under our conditions. We have bought the feed and paid market price for it. We have used baled hay, and paid for that. On your farms, your expenses should not be as great as ours. The transportation prob - lem and a good many other factors could not be charged to your cost of production. I believe you should evaluate that food. I do not believe the average farmer is leaving nubbins in the field with the understanding It is valueless. It is food that perhaps in not marketable, but it has a value, and that value should be assigned to it. In that way I think you will be getting nearer the cost of your production. I have given you the pounds of food for the different cows, and I think each man who cares to study the problem will consider it from his own standpoint, and will give himself and his friends justice in that. A little problem came up within the last month of the current price of food and milk. At the time we were paying $3.30 per hundred for 4 per cent milk. I found, by considering our labor as 8 per cent of our cost, we can produce it for $3.10 per hundred, or a difference of about ten cents to go to the man at the price we were getting at that time. I thank you for you attention. (Applause.) THE PRESIDENT: Next year I am sure your officers will do their best and will bring to you a splendid program. It is possible for you to bring enough men to fill this hall. It is up to you. The convention was then declared adjourned. </seg>
            <seg id="p082">THIRTY-SIXTH ANNUAL CONVENTION 83 BANQUET Thursday Evening, January 6, 1921 The Thirty-sixth Annual Banquet of the Nebraska Dairymen's Asso - ciation was held at the Lindeil Hotel, Linclon, Nebraska, with Hon. E. R. Danielson of Lincoln acting as Toastmaster. SECRETARY J. E. PALM, Lincoln: A banquet is never complete without a toastmaster. I take great pleasure in introducing to you Hon. E. R. Danielson, who will act in that capacity tonight. (Applause.) TOASTMASTER DANIELSON: Members of the Nebraska Dairy - men's Association, Ladies, and Friends: I am very glad indeed Mr. Palm did not introduce me as I have heard some toastma'sters introduced in the past, and especially somewhat in this manner: As the story goes, there was a lady who had been born and raised in a large city in the United States, who had never had the opportunity of getting her feet on Mother Earth on a real farm until she was quite well along in years. She had some relatives who lived on a farm and she decided to make them a visit. The morning after she arrived at the farm, she was inter - ested to learn what there was there, and started with this relative through the barn yard. "Oh, John, what is this?" she asked, "That is a chicken." "A chicken? I have eaten them. And what is this?" "That is a cow." "What are these?" "Those are pigs." "What is this, and this?" "Those are horses." Pretty soon away off in one corner of the yard they heard a big, long bray, and she said, "Oh, what is that?" ' 'That's the toastmaster," (Laughter.) A toastmaster has no regular subject on which to talk, nor any particular text. You have had enough business to talk about — or if you haven't you will before the week ends. I am surely glad to have the opportunity of being with you tonight to say a few words to the men who represent such an industry as yours — one of the truly basic industries of our republic. I am pleased to see you here tonight. It is well that you get together for a short period of frivolity. This is a day of organization and co-operation. This is a day when the world is so big, when corporations are so powerful, when condi - tions are so difficult, when competition is so keen, and when — during this readjustment and reconstruction time — the future is so uncertain, that never has there been a time since man lived upon the earth when a </seg>
            <seg id="p083">84 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION man by himself was so little and the world so big and so difficult in business, in public and in private life as today. This is the day when we are compelled to belong to things. We are compelled to affiliate with organizations composed of men and wo - men in our own lines, for our own protection, information and education. I came upon these lines I want to give you at this time: When the workmen own the workshops, And the railroad men the rails, And the grocery clerk the groceries, And the mail clerks all the mails; When the preachers own the pulpits. And Ijhe pressmen own the shops, And the drillers own the oil wells, And the jails are owned by cops; When conductors own the street cars, And each driver owns his bus, Will you tell us common people Whatinell becomes of us? (Applause.) ' My reply to this was this: Have you ever stopped to think what a glorious 1 old world this is — how good it is — how beautiful? Get out from the gloom a morbid theology has cast over the earth calling it a valley of dry bones and a veil of tears where darkness reigns save when lighted by the flames of a diseased imagination. Get away from the shadow of a pessimistic philosophy of life, into the sunlight of optimistic realism. Come up out of your valley of dry bones and live in this wonderful Garden of Love which glows with beauty, and above which bends the rainbow of promise. The object of life: Be happy. The place to be happy: Here. The time to be happy: Now. The way to be happy: Make others happy. (Applause.) Sometimes I think that men and women who cannot work together are not quite sane, and this recalls to my mind a little incident that happened not long ago in the city of Lincoln. A man of national fame came here to visit our State Insane Asylum. They escorted him over the grounds, showing him the buildings and the equipment they have for the care of these unfortunate people. Finally one of the guards took this visitor under a large tree on the grounds, and a great many of the insane people gathered around them. The visitor said to the guard: "I do not believe we should stay out here — just the two of us. These people may get together and assault us." The guard replied: "If those people could get together on anything, they would not be here." (Laughter.) Sometimes I think when people won't co-operate, when they won't work together, while perhaps it is not an indication of insanity, yet they are not quite one hundred per cent normal. </seg>
            <seg id="p084">THIRTY-SIXTH ANNUAL CONVENTION 85 I know you have a great many problems. I know there is a great movement today for the stabilization of values. I know that some very difficult, and in many instances, some very tragic things have happened in the last few months. Our young stockmen and young farmers have not great reserve. They have not any great accumulation. They have made their leases and their contracts and predicted their business 1 on a high-price basis and they find themselves almost wiped out. We have had a great deal of talk about profiteering, about the high cost of living; and then, too, we have heard in our country a great deal regarding the cost of high living. We have all been extravagant. It is too easy for all of us 1 to say "Yes." and to hard for any of us to say "No." We are the fastest living and the most generous spending, and sometimes the shortest-sighted people, in all the world. First we will talk about the ladies and then we will talk about the men. Not being familiar with the conditions in the localities' in which you may reside, I will only speak of conditions as I see them daily existing here in Lincoln. The ladies here have clubs. I do not know exactly what they do at these clubs, but I do know they go around from house to house. They may play cards, they may have sewing circles, or something of that kind. The first lady who entertains will serve some punch. The next lady will say, "Really, that was not enough," and when her time comes, she will serve punch and wafers. The next hostess will serve punch, wafers, and sandwiches. Then Mrs. So-and-So says, "Wasn't it strange she served sandwiches without coffee?" so she adds coffee. Then Mrs. Smith says. "That was a lovely party. She is such a nice lady! I wonder why she did not serve ice cream?" So when Mrs. Smith's turn comes, she adds ice cream, and her successor adds cake to the menu, so before they get around to the home of the last member of their club, they are having real banquets. Does it make anybody feel better? It is done in the spirit of pride and vanity. How about the men? I can't excuse them, for one man buys a Ford and then his neighbor gets a Buick. A third man in the block buys a Packard. One man in the community gets a small victrola. The next man must have a large one — not because it plays any louder, or longer or better, but because it costs more. We ought to invite people into our homes because we want them, not becau.se we want to stuff them, and then say, when we attend their party, that it was not as good and did not cost so much as ours. Go all through the animal kingdom — fowls and beasts of every kind — and you will find this a law of nature that never changes and never fails: it is always the male of the species that has the fine feathers or the shaggy mane, and does all the roaring and all the strutting and all the crowing. A hen will lay an egg, and a rooster will crow about it. And yet for a good many hundred years, since men and women could read and write, we men have been getting away with it, declaring that women were vain and we were not; and you know it isn't -so. </seg>
            <seg id="p085">86 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION The American people have reversed the motto of "Service, not Self." To illustrate this reminds me of the time when a Chautauqua was being held at Beatrice. Shortly after the afternoon program started, a group of people came into the tent together, sat down together and listened for a little while; then they whispered and giggled, elbowed and disturbed everybody, and before the lecture was 1 over, they got up and went out, and everybody was glad they were gone. At the close of the program, the speaker of the afternoon said to the platform manager: "That was a strange group of people we had in here. They came in late. They left early. They disturbed those who wanted to hear. Not often do we have a crowd of people like that." The platform manager replied: "You probably do not know that we have in Beatrice the institution for the feeble-minded, and they figure while it may not do them any good to hear these lectures, it cannot do them any harm." (Laughter.) Ever since that day, when I have noticed people whispering and bothering others, I have always drawn my own conclusions. We are going to have the pleasure of listening to some good toasts, but I would not have you come to this banquet tonight to enjoy the feast provided for us and to listen' to the toasts which are to fol - low, without pausing for a moment to pay a tribute to our country, our institutions, and the things we hold dear. I like ever slate. My people came from Illinois; so there is no malice in this story. I think now we live in the garden spot of the world, and yet we have people who move away to other places. I remember a man who moved from Nebraska, going first to Missouri, then to Kansas, and then to Oklahoma. There he died and went to hell, but the change had been so gradual he did not notice it at all. (Laughter.) In closing, I want to pay a little tribute to the scrub cow: Good bye, old Brindle, bony scrub! The time demands a better breed. KYou eat enough — but there's the rub; You never pay for half your feed. So after all these years we part. But pray remember as you go: If this should break your bovine heart. You broke my purs'e. long, long ago. (Laughter.) The speaker I am going to call on first reminds me of a little story. When the Board of this organization asked me to accept the position of Toastmaster, I commenced to do some tall thinking. I do most of my thinking after I go to bed. While I was still thinking, I dropped asleep. I had a dream. In that dream I thought I took upon myself wings and started toward the pearly gates. When I arrived, I met St. Peter, and he asked for my name and address. When I had given them to him, St. Peter said: "You will have to abide by the rules and regulations we have </seg>
            <seg id="p086">THIRTY-SIXTH ANNUAL CONVENTION 87 laid down," and he handed me a bundle of chalk. "You will go over that hill, and when you get on the other side you will find a large blackboard. On that you must write all the sins you have committed on the earth below." I started over the hill and met Mr. Morrison coming back. I said, "What are you coming this way for?" "I am going for more chalk." (Laughter and applause.) I take pleasure in introducing to you this evening the honorable President of this Association — Dr. Harvey A. Morrison — who will talk to you — and remember the day of the four-minute man is passed and the day of the fifteen-minute man is here — on "Our Dairy Association." (Ap - plause.) PRESIDENT H. A. MORRISON: Mr. Toastmaster, Ladies and Gentlemen*: It has already been announced to you what the giving of a toast will do for a man. It has laid out two or three, as you may see by the absentees on our program. I fear very much you will wish it had laid out one more. I tell you, boys, it is wors'e than the experi - ence of that soloist a little while ago. (Laughter.) I sympathize with myself on occasions of this kind. I have a great sympathy for the other fellow, too. But it has been by custom to allow my sympathy for the other man to outweigh the sympathy I have for myself, and to do as 1 am told to do. I do not know how it is these toastmasters are always able to tell such wonderful stories that are so true. (Laughter.) Some way I never had the gift of giving anything excepting these everyday facts that are so common to all of us. I know you are ging to have some substitutes tonight. I read a little story the other day on substitutes. A lady superintendent of schools was visiting one of the rooms and she noticed a certain boy had been acting up a good deal. She finally said to the teacher: "Did you ever try kindness with that boy?" "Yes, but it doesn't work. I gave that up. ! Then the superintendent went down to speak to that lad, and in - vited him to her home that evening. When he arrived, she got out a little lunch for him, and played some music, and entertained him, and then prepared to give him a little lecture. When we asked him about his conduct in school, he did not seem to be ashamed of it. He said, "You are talking to the wrong fellow. That other boy gave me a dime to come in his place and take your jawing." (Laughter.) When we were at the National Show in Chicago — and these are true stories — I have men here who can vouch for this one, but whether they will or not I do not know — we were trying to arrange for the program of this Association. Secretary Palm, Professor Frandsen and I happened to be together. The Professor suggested that we drink some special kind of milk they were serving. We were very glad to accept his kind Invitation. I believe they had the carbonized milk. The man in charge </seg>
            <seg id="p087">NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION 88 was explaining the different ways to serve it. He said, "Do you want it Charged or not charged?" Professor Frandsen said, "Charged." I was next. He asked me the same question. I said, "Charged Then came Mr. Palm. He asked him the same, and Palm said, "No, I will pay for it." (Laughter and applause.) Now, really, I do not know as I have anything worth while to say to you tonight. I suppose my toast would be about two minutes, instead of four, or fifteen. There are many things we could discuss in regard to our business. I could quote prominent men as to the conditions that exist, but I am afraid I would get into trouble as some of our legislators did when they attempted to quote a great man. I suppose there are some legislat - ors here, but I won't affirm whether they are guilty or not guilty. This legislator was completing a famous speech of his, and said, "In the words of Daniel Webster, who wrote the dictionary, 'Give me liberty, or give me death!'" (Laughter.) His colleagues pulled his coat and said. "Daniel Webster did not write the dictionary. It was Noah." He replied in a whisper: "Noah? He built the ark." (Laughter.) I do not know what kind of an impression Nebraska is making upon the world today in the dairy business, but some how, some way, those in the east and some of the countries across the sea where scholar - ship 'has meant so much to them, have felt we were clear out over the margin. That was impressed upon me a few years ago. Before that time I had not known the people thought of us out here in Nebraska in the way they do sometimes 1 . I spent one year in Boston, and Professor Wallace, who was form - erly connected with the University of Nebraska, had obtained a leave of absence and was spending his time in London reading old court Latin in regard to Shakespeare. He spent a good many months at it. It was at a time when London was about to erect a memorial to Shape - speare. Professor Wallace found that according to the records, those Londoners were- about to erect it on the wrong corner. He announced it to the world. It stirred London. In the Boston papers I read. "Who is this man Wallace who comes 1 to London to tell us about Shakespeare? He comes from Nebraska — away out west among the Indians!" So that is about tlie way people have thought of those of us in Ne - braska. I have been wondering to what extent we as dairymen are making ourselves felt in our country at large? Much has been said in regard to the financial conditions that exist In our country, especially among the farmers, including, of course, the dairymen. You know every individual Is trying to find a way out of the </seg>
            <seg id="p088">THIRTY-SIXTH ANNUAL CONVENTION 89 difficulties, and is anxious to go any place where an individual can sug - gest a way out; yet it seems to me at this time we are overlooking some of the things that are going to help us out of this 1 situation. First I would like to say I do not believe any one man or thing Is going to pick us up and carry us out. It depends upon the men and women in this State and in this great nation of ours to work shoulder to shoulder and pull even, in a time like this. There is a condition now, as far as the dairymen in this State are concerned, and as far as the farmers in general are concerned, that is similar to the condition that existed a good many years ago in this western country. I think perhaps there are those here tonight who can remember well when we could raise splendid crops on this virgin soil, and had no market for them. There were no transportation facilities' to get them to the market. Someway the conditions that exist today are similar to those condi - tions in this respect: the transportation facilities and the costs to get our products to the great world centers is one of the great problems of the farmer today. For instance, I do not know that I remember what alfalfa is quoted at in Chicago — $25 or $28 a ton, perhaps. I telephoned a few days ago to the freight office, before this 50 per cent reduction went into effect. They said the freight from Lincoln to Chicago on alfalfa was eight dollars a ton. The man who produced it and put it up and stored it, and furnished the land on which it was raised, would get about that same amount, perhaps. Then- what does it cost to get it to New York and over seas? I say this is one of the problems — getting these farm products to the great centers where they can be used. This condition being true, the time has come when the farmers of Nebraska must study the question very carefully, and undertake to mar - ket their products in what I might term a more concentrated form. I mean by that the time has come when we can put those products into these great centers and ship them in a way that will not cost so much in transportation. I do not know of any better way, or one that will mean so much both to us as citizens of Nebraska and to our own coun - try, than to do it through the products of the dairy cow. (Applause.) I cannot help but feel in this great State where we have all the facilities in the very best form to grow all the dairy feed, it ought to be the very center of the dairy business in our country. I realize that is impossible until we reach out and touch the lives of our friends- and neighbors all over this State. By the way, I feel every member of this Association ought to go home Inspired, and with a determination to in - spire his neighbors along this line, that we may see a great growth in the dairy business- — in the breeding of dairy cattle and the building up of splendid dairy herds in our State. I think most of us out in this country do not realize or appreciate fully — though we know it theoretically — the general situation that exists even In our own country. I was very much Impressed with a little ex - perience when I was In Chicago, at the National Show, by the tact that </seg>
            <seg id="p089">90 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION each evening boys and girls — some of them almost barefooted and with tattered clothes, and some of them reasonably clean, but some fearfully dirty — would come to that gate when the boys were milking in the barns, and ask the gateman to let them through, saying, "I want to get my pail filled with milk." The boys were glad indeed to give those little urchins milk. They came by the dozens to get through. Sometimes the gate - man did not dare commence, because pretty soon he would have a hundred. Yet he would let a few through, and some of them found other means, perhaps, not quite so legitimate. They came to get the milk their physical bodies needed for their development. This is what impressed itself upon my mind. We who keep away from these great cities scarcely realize how much some of these young - sters are cut off from that need for the development of their physical bodies, and the mental, and the moral. I believe that is one of the great needs that exist in our country today. Some how, some way, I wish that we as dairymen could get the vision that our country needs more of the products' from the dairy cow. There are boys and girls growing up in early childhood and youth who are not normal physically, mentally, or morally, because their bodies have not been properly fed. Our country can afford to see to it they are properly fed, for it would mean fewer inmates of such institutions as we have here to the south of this city, in the penitentiary, and in places like the asylums'. So I believe the dairyman can feel he is doing something for someone, and serving someone besides himself, by promoting the idea of producing more of the dairy products. By the way, it is only when we have learned that great lesson of service to others and having an interest in those about us' and our com - munity and State and nation, that we will ever solve the kind of prob - lems that are before this country .at this time. I wish — I hope — every man connected in any way with the dairy business in Nebraska will see that great problem behind his business, and push his work, and inspire his neighbors in this direction more than he ever has before. I feel we are really doing a work that is upon higher and more noble standards than we have sometimes viewed it in the past. Now, ladies and gentlemen, it is not always pleasant, and sometimes it is tiresome, to see a great freight train go along; and how glad you are when you see the caboose! In connection with this, a story came to me some months ago — from Pennsylvania, I think — but I heard it before meeting our friend here tonight, so he is not responsible for the story. There was a family by the name of Carr living in a certain neighborhood. In this family were ten children, and there was a new arrival. The father said, "We have a new Carr over at our house." To which the neighbor replied, "I presume that is the caboose." (Laughter and applause.) THE TOASTM ASTER: President Morrison must be able to see farther than I do when he spoke about some members of the legislature </seg>
            <seg id="p090">91 THIRTY-SIXTH ANNUAL CONVENTION being here tonight. This recalls a little story regarding a man who was in the legislature and had been down at the capital several weeks. He came home one Sunday, and in the middle of the night his wife attempted to waken him, saying, "John, hurry and get up. There are burglars in the house!" "No, you are mistaken," said John; "there ain't no burglars in the House; they are over in the Senate." (Laughter.) We have with us tonight some visitors to Nebraska. We always like to have these men come into our State from other places. His presence tonight, and the conditions under which he is here, recalls to my mind a story about a young preacher's son. After reaching his 'teens, he became very much of a card fiend. One day the boy happened to be in his father's study where he had his cards dealt out on the table and was playing solitaire, when he heard the footsteps of his dad approaching. He hastily got the cards together, but where would he hide them? The first place he thought of was the pocket of his father's baptismal frock — these folks were Baptists. He ditched the cards and forgot about them. Sunday there were to be several immersions in the river and this minister was to perform the cermonies. He donned his frock and started down. When the first candidate came along, they stepped into the water. The ministerial frock commenced to spread, and out came a card . . Then another and another. Here was the ace and king and queen and jack and ten of spades. His wife saw what was happening, and turned to the culprit with the words, "Son, something must be done to save father!" "Mother, that's a royal flush. If he can't save himself, nobody else can." (Laughter.) I am going to introduce to you Professor A. A. Borland, head of the Dairy Department of the College of Pennsylvania. If he can't save him - self, we sure can't give him any assitsance. (Applause.) PROFESSOR A. A. BORLAND. Harrisburg, Pa.: Mr. Toastmaster, Ladies and Gentlemen: It won't be necessary for me to save myself, since I am not a Baptist; and perhaps I won't have to take the risks some other people have taken. When I was listening to these endearing songs, I thought some of these young men were perhaps in the position of the young man who found himself in Atlantic City last summer with his sweetheart. They had been strolling along the beach and having a good time throwing sand all over one another. The young lady had a small parasol. This parasol was over her shoulder. In some mysterious manner, the young man's arm found its way about the waist of the young lady. They had been sitting and not saying a word. At last the girl said: "Why don't you say something to me?" "I can't; my mouth is full of sand." "Swallow it! You need it in your system." (Laughter.) I think some of these men need a little more sand in their systems </seg>
            <seg id="p091">92 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION When speaking about this caboose of the train, I was reminded of the Pennsylvania Dutch expression. They usually get the verb before the subject and get the adjectives all mixed up. I remember one little fellow who saw a freight train and said, "Mother, when the little red car makes past, is the train all?" (Laughter.) I do not know how long it will take for the train to be "all" tonight. I want to give a toast tonight to the high calling of the dairyman — a vocation which I think is very well worth while, and one of which every dairyman can well be proud. When we think that in the United States there are 2,500,000 babies under one year, and 1,800,000 infants who must depend on cow's milk for food, we realize something of the importance of the dairy cow to the economic welfare of the nation. When we consider the more recent dis - coveries — that milk contains elements' which are vital to the growth and well-being of children, and very helpful to the grown-ups — we realize again the importance of the dairy cow. Again, these vitamines are found in connection with the butter fat of milk. It means no oleo or so-called "substitutes" can be a real substitute for butter in the true sense of the word. So the dairy industry is vital to the welfare of the union. If we were to load the 300 million gallons of milk produced in Ne - braska in a year on a freight train and start for Chicago, what sort of a load would it make? If you were to put twenty tons of milk in a car, with a car forty feet long, when the engine passed Galesburg and was sixty-five miles on the other side, the caboose would just be leaving Lincoln. (Applause.) That is how much milk is produced in this State in one year. If you were to put on freight trains all the milk produced in the United States in a year, loading it on freight trains putting twenty tons in a car, you would have a train load 16,650 miles long. It would take four freight train loads of milk reaching from San Francisco to New York to carry all this milk. If you were to put it on one line 6,500 miles long, you would have six train loads of milk reaching that distance. That Is how much milk we produce in one year. So It is really a very im - portant business. If you would consider the value of this milk at four cents a quart, you would have a valuation of $1,758,000,000 — more money from this dairy industry than is produced in a year fn the United States from all the gold and silver and copper and lead and zinc and oil and gas. You would have to throw in $500,000,000 on top of this mineral wealth to have the value of the dairy products from these cows in a single year. The dairy industry is so big it reminds me of the story of the Mich - igan Irishman who went to California. They were telling about the big things in California: "Our redwood trees are the largest in the world; the Yosemite Valley is the largest valley in the world," etc. </seg>
            <seg id="p092">THIRTY-SIXTH ANNUAL CONVENTION 93 Finally this Irishman grew tired of hearing of so many big things. He said, "Do you know, we have some big things in Michigan? If all the apples we produced were dumped into the Atlantic Ocean, you could walk across dry shod to Europe. If all our hogs were made into one big hog, its tusks could rip the Panama Canal into pieces. If all our cows were made into one big cow, she could eat grass off the equator, and switch the icicles off the North Pole with her tail." (Laughter.) Pat was right. If all the cows were made into one big cow, it would reach around the world. If the value of the dairy products of the United States were taken in silver dollars and made just to touch each other, it would make a silver band to reach around the world. The dairy industry is a big industry, and I believe a splendid one for a man to engage in, and it is going to be better in the future than in the past. In New York City the increase in the consumption of milk has been over one-third in the last twenty years. The fact that people are realizing the food value of milk and its economy is going to increase its consumption. Milk at ten cents a quart is only half as expensive as beefsteak at twenty-eight cents a pound; one-tenth as expensive as oysters at forty cents a quart, and: one-third as expensive as eggs at thirty-six cents a dozen. We are going to use more milk in the future than in the past. The people in the United States are only consuming a pound of milk per day. They are only eating three-fourths of an ounce of cheese, and twelve-thousandths of an ounce of milk powder. There is room for a great expansion of the dairy business. I had quite a lengthy speech prepared, but I have forgotten most of it by this time. I am forgetful, anyway. Three ladies were speaking about how forgetful their husbands were. One lady, whose husband is a surgeon, said: "My husband is so forget - ful! The other day he was to perform an operation, and when he got there he found he did not have his case containing the surgical instru - ments, and could not go on with the operation." The preacher's wife said: "That is pretty bad, but I do not think your husband is as absent-minded as mine. One time he went to preach a funeral sermon. He found he had forgotten his sermon, and they had to bury the corpse without it." The third lady said: "Your husbands are forgetful, but my husband is a traveling man, and he is more forgetful than yours. The other night he came home and rushed up and put his arms around me and said, 'Hello, little Girl! Where have I met you before?' " (Laughter.) I think as dairymen in Nebraska we ought to have some pretty definite aims. I am reminded of the story of the man who had the wrong aim. Once upon a time a man went to a hotel to stay all night. He found every room was full except one. The proprietor said, "We have a vacant </seg>
            <seg id="p093">94 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION room, but I will have to tell you this room is haunted. A murder was committed there once, and ghosts come out every night." The man did not know what to do. He said, "I will take a look at that room." The proprietor showed him the room. It looked cozy and pleasant, so he said, "I guess I'll risk it." About two o'clock he woke up — a bright moonlight night — and could see at the foot of his bed a hand standing right straight up. His hair began to stand on end. Very gently he put his hand beneath his pillow and drew out his revolver. Bang! He shot two toes off his own foot! So it is important to know what you are aiming at. I think one of the things you ought to aim at is better dairy cows. Some of you fellows are in the business of dairying with a bunch of Hereford cows. They are beautiful to look at, but what is the use of those cows if you are going to be in the dairy business? It is like going out on a race track and trying to win a 2:10 trot with a Percheron horse. Not that there is anything wrong with the horse. It is one of the finest animals there is, but he was not built for that purpose. So why should a man expect to go into the dairy business with cows not built for this purpose, any more than he would enter a race with horses not built for trotting? If he is going to be in the dairy business to win, he should have a cow that will trot, and that is a Holstein or Jersey or Ayrshire or Guernsey. I have nothing against the others. They are fine animals for their purpose. I think the matter of feeding might well be taken into consideration. Some cows' do not produce milk because they are not fed right. A cow is like an automobile. How? In this way. An automobile needs two things to keep it in good running order: repair material, and fuel. The cow needs protein, which is repair material. That is the reason clover and alfalfa are such great cow feed. Then she needs an accelerator to make her go, and the fats are the substances to furnish fuel. We can - not expect her to winter around a straw stack and make a lot of milk. I want to close by paying a tribute to the dairy business. It is a big, fundamental business — a worth-while vocation — to any man. It is as much worth while as the young man I heard of considered the tunnel in the train. He was going through the tunnel with his lady love, and seized the opportunity to imprint a kiss on the young lady's cheek. An old gentleman sitting ahead of them turned around and said, "Do you know this tunnel cost a million dollars?" "No, I don't know; but if it did, it is worth it." (Laughter.) So the dairy business is a worth-while business, and I think we should be proud of it. I have enjoyed being out here. It has been a real treat, and your welcome has been a real pleasure and delight. I shall go home with pleasant memories of Nebraska. I thank you. (Applause.) </seg>
            <seg id="p094">THIRTY-SIXTH ANNUAL CONVENTION 95 THE TOASTMASTER: All those figures! AH those statistics! I will have to come up for air on that. In introducing the next speaker this evening I am reminded of the story of the colored fellow. A bunch of darkeys gathered in a room and started on one of their favorite pastimes of rolling African golf balls. One negro was having better luck than the others and things seemed to be coming his way. He had the rest about cleaned up and all the money they had, when the police broke in on them. This nigger who had been so forunate still had a rabbit's foot with him, and in the break-away, he was the only one who escaped. He knew he could not stay around town or they would get him, so he started west and landed in a small place and decided to mend his ways. He found out there was a little negro Baptist church without a preacher, and he said, "Here's where I make good." He secured the pastorate of the church and began to preach. The other niggers served their sentences and were turned loose. One of them thought he did not want to stay around town, so he beat it. He wound up in a little town, and struck another nigger and said, "What you got goin' on aroun' this town?" "Nothin' 'cept a little revival meetin" goin' on at the church." So the new arrival went down to the church, and reached the door just as the audience was finishing one of the songs and the preacher was going up on the rostrum. He recognized the preached immediately, so he started to walk down the center aisle until very near the pulpit, where he stopped and looked into the preacher's face. The minister saw the nigger recognized him. He said: "Breddern and sisters, I will take for my text this evening a few words from the Book of Ezekiel: 'If you see me and hear me; if you recognize my voice, make no disturbance, and I will see you later.' " (Laughter.) It gives me great pleasure to introduce to you the Dean of the Agri - cultural College here — E. A. Burnett. (Applause.) DEAN BURNETT: Mr. Toastmaster, Ladies and Gentlemen: I do not exactly know what way this introduction fits, but I will stop after the meeting and see the gentleman later. (Laughter.) It occurs to me after hearing all these statistics of the previous speaker showing the largeness of the business, there is explanation, per - haps, of the reason why Nels sold his bed and bought a lantern when he started in about a year ago to make a record out at the dairy barn. I hope now the record is over, that somebody will furnish Nels a bed and give him a little rest. We are certainly proud of the record, and proud of the man who made it. I think probably from this time on, La Verna will be better known than any other member of the faculty. Most things come to use too easy, or at least, the delays which come often result in larger and better growth than we could have secured had not obstacles fallen in our way and delayed for a time the work on our </seg>
            <seg id="p095">96 minds to do. It occurs to me this is well illustrated in the growth of the Dairy Department during these ten years since Professor Frandsen has been with us. I believe any of us who will think back over that time, and think of the plans and aspirations 1 we had for dairy work in the University of Nebraska at that time and during the early years that followed, will readily see the growth of the Dairy Department in the University has very greatly exceeded our early plans. I remember just about the time Professor Frandsen came to us this Association began to pass resolutions in favor of a new dairy building. I think it the first resolution that was passed, they wanted $40,000 to erect that building. There was a growth of sentiment and an apprecia - tion of the need that something be done and more or less agitation on the part of the dairymen and a growth of sentiment in the legislature, and then there were delays. A little later the legislature was asked for an appropriation of $80,000 to build the dairy building. Then there were complications, and the Governor vetoed the appropriation passed by the legislature, because there was another large problem on in the University as to whether or not v e should consolidate our plants, and build at the University Farm, or whether we should build two separate plants. When the matter was finally decided, instead of having a building that would cost $40,000, or a building of $80,000, we secured a building which was modern and up-to-date, and cost, by the time it was completed, practically $250,000. Of course during all that time there had been an increase in the need and in the different lines of industry which centered in the dairy business. There had been growth in the needs of the College along all lines; but most of all, perhaps, in the latter part of that period, this ap - preciation of what was actually needed to build a modern plant was in - fluenced by the man who had come into the Department and taken charge of the dairy work. I know frequently he disturbed the administration of the University by the largeness of his plans. Not infrequently members of the administration wondered if it would not be possible to do what was necessary with less money; but there alls the time stood the Pro - fessor in charge in the way, who was not to be satisfied unless we had a little better building than anywhere in the United States. In the pro - cess of building it, nearly every good dairy building was visited. Every time a building was visited, a new idea crept into ours, until finally, after a delay of six years after Professor Frandsen came to us, we had a plant which was modern and provided for growth for a good many years to come. So that is one of the things which delay, and a study of the prob - lem, and persistence on the part of the man in charge, and gathering in - formation from all the sources, brought to this institution. As the years go by, we will continuously be benefited by the thought and effort and work which was put into the planning and construction </seg>
            <seg id="p096">THIRTY-SIXTH ANNUAL CONVENTION 97 of this building. A bigger University wjll be built because of the efforts which went into the construction of this building. I use this as a type, because the head of the Dairy Department was not so different from the head of another Department at the College. We have had built an Agricultural Engineering building which I think is considered the "last word" in the construction of buildings of that type for an institution like ours. That had hardly been completed before another man came along with the idea we should develop at our particular institution a plant which would be the best in the country for the study of animal diseases. Finally, after a little delay, that building was an accomplished fact. Those three buildings stand on our Farm campus today as illustra - tions of what it is possible for any man to do who has ideals and suffi - cient technical knowledge, who has a sympathetic field in which to work, and who prosecutes that work until he has finally accomplished the thing for which he sought. Not only have we built up at the University a Dairy Building of which we may well be proud, but a herd of cattle of which we may well be proud — a herd which I believe is not duplicated in any Agricultural College in the United States, at least, so far as our Holstein herd is con - cerned. I think our other herds could be more than duplicated in many places. I was looking up the records day before yesterday. Taking from the inventory the production of seven Holstein cows, starting with La Verna and her record, which all of you know, I listed seven Holstein cows with an average butter record of 908 pounds per year. One of the seven was a ten month's record, and not twelve. I do not think that can be dupli - cated in any Agricultural College in the United States. I question if it can be duplicated in many private herds. In many other ways' the work of the Dairy Department and its in - flusnce has grown during this period of years. I question whether there have ever been ten years in the history of an institution where the work of a department has expanded more and been more favorably received. I believe in the contact which this department has secured with the pro - ducing public and with all the people who are interested in the dairy business and in the farming business, we can feel that these have been most fruitful years for the institution. Now the question comes as to how such a position can be filled in a way which will continue the growth and the expansion of this work in the State, and will give impetus and inspiration to the men who are behind the dairy business trying to build it up in Nebraska. It might be of interest to you to know that the leaving of a man from the University is not a new or strange thing at all. During the last two years, thirty-one men out of sixty-seven instructors at the University Farm have left to go to other positions. In the last six years the turn- </seg>
            <seg id="p097">98 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION over in the Experiment Station has been 100 per cent. In the College it has also been 100 per cent. That means that there is change and re - organization in a line of work which can only be successfully prosecuted with a considerable degree of permanence in its personnel, and the de - gree in which we secure permanence marks to a large extent the progress of the work in our institution. I think it is easily possible that a professor of Latin or mathematics or history can go from the University and be succeeded by another man who could fill the place rather quickly and rather quickly assume re - sponsibility, possibly without permanent loss. But in every agricultural line it is necessary before a man becomes most valuable to the State that he knows the physical condition; that he becomes acquainted with the State, and that he knows his constituency in the field before he can render the highest type of service. So I want to suggest to you that immediately, and in the years to come, you interest yourselves in the problem of placing the University upon such a financial basis it can secure greater permanence in its per - sonnel. Whenever it becomes necessary to go out and look for a new man to fill an important position in the institution, the question in the minds of the people who are responsible for securing such men should be, "Can he fill the place? Is he big enough for the position?" If that sort of a situation could be devloped so that the only problem was to go out and secure the man who was fitted to the place, and pay the price neces - sary to secure him, we would not have so many changes as there have been in the past, and we would have a more successful institution, more permanence in our work, more aggressiveness in our several depart - ments, and greater efficiency all along the line. Peronally, I want to say to Professor Frandsen and Mrs. Prandsen that the ten years which they have spent here have led us to feel a very personal interest in them and in their success in the future. It is with universal regret that our faculty sees him going into other lines of work. Always when we are forced to bid God speed to those who go from this institution, we do it wishing them the best of success; and always when we bring new men to our institution, we do it in the hope and expecta - tion they will find a field in the institution where they can work with pleasure and benefit to the State. (Applause.) THE TOASTMASTER: We hve another visitor with us this evening — a man from the United States Dairy Department. I am going to take it for granted this gentleman is somewhat inclined along the line of the man who was talking with one of his neighbors on the street, and during the discussion he said to his friend: "I will tell you what I can do. I can tell the religion of a man by the kind of automobile he drives." The other fellow could not get that at all. "Now I will show you I know what I am talking about. See that big Packard going down the street? "Yes. 1 </seg>
            <seg id="p098">THIRTY-SIXTH ANNUAL CONVENTION 99 "The fellow who drives it is an Episcopalian. And see that Franklin? The fellow who drives that is a Methodist. They are loud-shouting folks who make lots of noise. See that White Steamer? That fellow Is a Baptist. They believe in lots of water." "Yes, but listen: I have you now. How about this fellow coming down the street in a Ford?" "Oh, he's a Christian Scientist. He only thinks he has an auto - mobile." (Laughter.) I assure you it is a pleasure to me to meet these gentlemen, and I know it is to you. I am going to ask Mr. Winkger to say a few words to us this evening. MR. J. G. WINKGER, Washington, D. C: Ladies and Gentlemen: I do not like to criticise your Toastmaster, but he has made a mistake in asking me to respond to a toast, because I think this is probably the third or fourth time I ever attempted it in my life. He made a mistake, too. when he said the speakers tonight were fifteen-minute men, for I am in the five-minute class. He also made a mistake because he said thi3 was to be a time of frivolity tonight. I cannot be funny when I try. It is mostly when I do not try that I am funny. Talking about ministers, I am very often mistaken by strangers for a minister. I was 1 eating my dinner in a dining car once, and before the man sitting at the same table ordered his glass of beer, he very politely asked me if I objected. Another instance was when a ticket agent, mis - taking me for a minister, gave me a half-fare ticket. A third instance of this kind happened in Oregon in October last. I went from Ashland to a little place across the Bay, and coming back there was a man who was talking pretty loud. He would get up in the seat and wave his hands as if preaching. Again he would quote, sometimes from Scripture and sometimes from a noted author. He kept it up for a long time. The passengers laughed at him. I sat down thinking about something else. The next thing I knew, he was standing by my side. He said, "The con - ductor informs me you are a minister, and I beg your pardon for talking the way I have been doing." (Laughter.) He addressed me as "Rev - erend," and asked me where my church was located. I told him I was a missionary and traveled all over the United States. I have been coming here to Nebraska for a long period of time, and I can see the changes that have taken place. You are going forward all the time. I have been attending your meeting today, and I think you have shown more progress than at any previous meeting. One of your professors handed me a letter received from a very good friend in Minneapolis. In this letter he gives some reminiscences. He said he was in Lincoln some time back. He went from Lincoln to Crete before Crete was on the map. They were camping and stopped on the prairies. While he was 1 cooking breakfast he heard a peculiar sound like thunder, but the sky was perfectly clear. It continued for a long time. He did not find out the solution until they came to the station of the </seg>
            <seg id="p099">100 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION Burlingon railroad just building, and the telegraph operator had informa - tion a herd of four thousand buffaloes were stampeded. That was the rumbling they had heard. It struck me forcibly to get those thoughts of early days on the ground we are now, and at the same time seeing the progress before our eyes. If someone had pictured a scene like this to that man at that time he probably would have considered the one who pictured it as a hopeless visionary who did not know very much. The question is whether or not we are going to progress in the future in the way we have in the past? I think there are opportunities in the future as great as those in the past. There is opportunity for the dairymen to continue the good work. The Dairymen's Association is nothing more than an organization to try to fit one thing to match with the other so that the machinery of progress will go along in proper channels. It is inevitable. We cannot always see it. As we are talking and thinking, there is machinery built up that helps us perform the work we are doing and leads to greater progress. There is surely something in the future that is coming to us in keeping with this progress. (Ap - plause.) THE TOASTMASTER: I rather hesitate to introduce the last speaker this evening on account of his bashfulness. He related to me not long ago a little incident that occurred in his earlier life. He said he was in New York City one beautiful summer evening, and drifted into Battery Park with a lady friend. They sat down on a bench in the moon - light. He looked out across the Bay and he thought the psychological moment had arrived. He endeavored to get up courage necessary to say the proper thing. He looked at her. He blushed, and she blushed. He coughed, and she coughed. Then he talked about where they were last Sunday night, and where they would go next Sunday night, and finally they drifted into talking about the weather. All of a sudden he spied across the Bay the light on the Statue of Liberty, and said, "Doesn't it strike you as strange they have such a small light on the Statue?" She responded, "I do not know that it does. The smaller the light, the greater the liberty." (Laughter.) I now take pleasure in introducing to you Professor J. H. Frandsen. (Applause.) PROFESSOR J. H. FRANDSEN, Lincoln: Mr. Toastmaster, Ladies and Gentlemen, and Friends: The peculiar thing about this banquet to me is the remarkable number of true stories that have been told. (Laughter.) Julius, my older boy, was wondering why it was his little brother could not learn to say "Yes" and "No." I said, "There is nothing strange about that. It took his mother a long time to learn to say 'Yes.' " (Laughter.) These are hard financial times, and we have had our financial troubles. To cheer us up, we attempted to take an inventory of some of </seg>
            <seg id="p100">THIRTY-SIXTH ANNUAL CONVENTION 101 our material possessions, and it did not count up as much as we would like. Mrs. Frandsen suggested the three children should be worth three million dollars, but I said I would not pay that for another one. I have been laboring under the impression Mr. Anderson had been so engaged with the new Dairy Queen he did not have any time to make other acquaintances. I am surprised at what has been shown here to - night (Laughter.) I feel the Dairy Association ought to be reimbursed. I was in Chicago and had another peculiar experience there. I met a young man who used to be in a neighboring institution in dairy work. He had what we thought very high dairy ideals. His mother was also very much interested in dairying and in his dairy success. I asked him what he was doing. He hesitated to tell us, because we were in a dairy crowd. We finally asked him point blank. He stepped around to one side and said, "If you must know, I will tell you. I am working in an oleo factory in Chicago, but when you go back, don't tell my mother, because she really thinks I am tending bar." (Laughter.) I think that illustrates how a dairyman ought to feel toward substi - tutes. Let us keep in mind if we are going to get these children raised so that they may become perfect specimens of manhood and womanhood, they must have these dairy products. And let us do our part to see the sentiment is spread throughout the land that there is no substitute for any of the dairy products. I have been Joked a good deal about this new work of mine. I was at a conference, when someone jokingly said, "I am out of town a good deal of the time and my editor is away, and I want a man to write editorials." That sounded pretty good. But if there was anything in that that might make a fellow feel good, this other story will counteract it. I sug - gested it would be a nice thing to have a new running head for a page, and said it might cost fifty dollars to put it on. One wag said, "Why spend fifty dollars for that? Wouldn't it be better to spend fifty dollars getting a new head for the editor?" (Laughter.) So if there was con - ceit in the one, it was promptly taken out by the other. The subject assigned me this evening was, "LaVerna, Nebraska's New Dairy Queen." But I am not going to spend much time on that. As Dean Burnett said, she will soon be known. I have been out at a great many farmers' institutes where people would say, "I never heard of you, but you have a cow down there we have heard about long ago." One of these times you will hear even more of LaVerna. Nels is turning out more record-breaking cows per year than in any other institution known, and we want to give him credit for them. (Ap - plause.) But all these record-breaking cows are not in the University herd. A few years ago we celebrated the advent of LaMay, but since that we have had occasion to celebrate the record of the State herd being broken by Mr. Starkey's cow, and by a Jersey cow owned by Mr. </seg>
            <seg id="p101">102 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION Young. LaVerna is now the undisputed Dairy Queen of Nebraska. She has produced 29,555 pounds of milk and 1.310.6 pounds of butter in one year. She finished this record at eight years of age. Many questions have been asked. I would not for the world give this information if I were going to continue to ask for appropriations. Since I am about to step out, it is perfectly safe to let Dean Burnett hear this. Several have asked what we have done with LaVerna's product. The Department retails all its milk. We got fourteen cents a quart while she was fresh. Her sales amounted to 13,748 quarts of milk, at 14 cents a quart, which gave us an income of $1,924.72 for the year, which ought to leave a good profit after deducting any reasonable amount for food and care and labor. I would not have told that before or the Dean would have suggested, "Get another cow," and cut off all other sources of revenue. The average cow of the State produces less than 4,000 pounds of milk. Many people are satisfied with that, and express indifferent in - terest in better cows. The Cow Testing Association's campaign for pure - bred stcck will do much to improve this condition. We cannot make LaVernas out of Nebraska's dairy cows, but if we notice what has been done by the use of pure-bred sires and the weeding out of poor cows, I think you will agree we could at least double the product of Nebraska cows by these two means. We figure we have between six and seven thousand dairy cows. Double it. The application of these simple principles has largely been responsi - ble for the discovery of the queen cows in our herd, and raising the aver - age production of the University herd so that at the present time those cows have an average record of 614 pounds of butter a year. This wonderful story of LaVerna would not be complete if I stopped here. You will want to know something of the man who did this work. I want to take this opportunity of telling you I have come to know of the ability and devotion of the man who has had charge of this work. He is so different from the average fellow one could pick up in these days with scarcity of labor. I am reminded of a story which is applicable to the selection of men in the last few years. A man advertised for help. A man came. The employer asked what wages he wanted, and the man replied, "I do not know. What do you pay?" "I will pay you all you are worth." "I'll be darned if I'll work for that!" (Laughter.) There is more truth than poetry in that during the last few years. Since we have more help, it Is one of the things that will make the dairy business easier the next few years. But this story did not apply to the man called to take charge of caring for LaVerna. It is therefore with a great deal of pleasure I take this opportunity of telling you Nels Anderson was "the man behind the gun" who fed and milked this cow, and who declined invitations tor </seg>
            <seg id="p102">THIRTY-SIXTH ANNUAL CONVENTION 103 parties and movies and anything else that might in any way, shape or manner interfere with his work in caring for LaVerna. (Professor Prandsen then asked Mr. Anderson to rise.) Iln behalf of the Dairy Association and the University and for what have done for the dairy interests of the State, I take this oppor - ty of thanking you. (Applause.) There is just one other little pleasure I have at this time. It has become traditional with the Dairy Association to honor not only the record-breaking cows and the men who helped produce these records, but the other thing that has made Nebraska famous. Perhaps no other insti - tution In the country has had the honor of carrying away so many trophies in the Judging Contests as have the dairy judging teams from Nebraska. That has been long recognized. We have always been glad to contribute in a small measure to the success of these teams. They take more interest than I can tell you at this time in the work of your institution. We have the pleasure tonight of having with us the students who represened us at the Judging Contest this year. (Professor Frandsen asked the Team and its Coach to rise.) »The members of the team are: G. A. Milby, Carl Rydberg, Wayne Gray, with Profesor Thompson as Coach.' (Applause.) I PROFESSOR THOMPSON: This is the trophy presented by the rnsey Breeders' Association for the best work done in judging rnsey cattle at the Show. (Applause.) t PROFESSOR FRANDSEN: Again in behalf of the Department and Dairy Association, I thank you for the honor you have brought to the Itution by your good work at Chicago. (Applause.) t Words fail me to express to you the appreciation I have in my heart the kind words you have said tonight. In behalf of Mrs. Frandsen myself, we appreciate it more than we can say. (Applause.) (MR. H. F. McINTOSH, Omaha Chamber of Commerce, Omaha: If I y be permitted, I would like to say a word in regard to the production the champion cow. A good many things enter into a game like that, ere was a vision of a great cow in somebody's mind, and all the agen - s have but led up to the achievement. Yet the vision, and all the mcies, for that matter, could never have achieved without the man who the work. A couple of weeks ago when I had the pleasure of having Dean Burnett for my guest at the Chamber of Commerce in Omaha at luncheon one day — the day LaVerna finished her course of contest — it came to my mind at the moment when Dean Burnett told me one man had milked this cow by the clock four times a day for three hundred and sixty - five days without default, except for leave two days at one time when a brother from Denmark was a guest, that a man who could achieve that sort of fame ought to have some substantial recognition of his work, and should know that the world is responsive to loyalty and devotion to any </seg>
            <seg id="p103">104 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION cause, even if it is only the milking of a cow. And so I believe it would be only fitting for us to make recognition of Mr. Anderson's devotion by taking up a purse that would bring him something substantial, like a watch, or whatever the committee might suggest. I should like to begin that by a small financial contribution. There are half a hundred here who would contribute. (Applause.) (The contribution was then taken.) MR. C. H. GUSTAFSON, Lincoln: I move the money be turned over to the Secretary-Treasurer for him to purchase something suitable that would be appreciated by Mr. Anderson as a token of appreciation of the work he has done. MR. JOHN FRAZEUR, Omaha: I second the motion. If I understand the case and might interpret Mr. Anderson's feeling, I would say he would appreciate not the money — I don't think he cares a snap for that — but the feeling of these men and women here tonight. I imagine he will appreciate it very deeply. I am sure our Secretary is capable of purchasing a present that will give Mr. Anderson added pleasure. President Morrison then put the motion, which carried. MR. HAL C. YOUNG, Lincoln: I move the Association double the amount of the collection tonight. This was seconded by Mr. Gustafson, and carried. THE TOASTM ASTER: As far as your Toastmaster is concerned, his troubles are over. His remembrance of this very pleasant even - ing we have spent here will be with him many a day. I greatly ap - preciate being here, and trust you have been well enough entertained you will want to come back next year and bring more of the dairy people with you. I will now return the things given to me by placing this banquet back in the hands of the Secretary of the Association. (Applause.) SECRETARY PALM: I would like to tender my thanks, in behalf of the Association, to the Toastmaster. I am glad to see such a good turn-out, and hope to see you all next year, and many more. </seg>

Frandsen, Department of Dairy Husbandry La Verna the new queen among Nebraska's dairy cows, is a Holstein owned by the University Dairy Husbandry Department at Lincoln, Ne - braska. She has just finished a very remarkable year's 1 record. In her year's work, which was completed December 21, 1920, La Verna pro - duced 29,555 pounds of milk and 1310,60 pounds ot butter. This ranks her as the champion milk and butter producer of Nebraska and she has produced more milk and butter than any living cow owned by any University or Agricultural College in the United States 1 . Her record tor butter and milk is only exceeded by 16 cows of the breed in the United States. LA VERNA La Verna was put on official test December 23, 1919 at the age of seven years, one month and nine days. During the year ending December 21, 1920, her average daily production has been 81 pounds of milk. Her highest daily production reached the remarkable record of 112.7 pounds or a little more than 13 gallons. The following table gives her yield of milk and butter fat per month and the total amount of butter.

Best 7 day record — 729.0 lbs. milk, 27.528 lbs. fat, 34.410 lbs. butter. Before she freshened, she weighed 1800 pounds and when her strenu - ous year's work ended she still weighed 1750 pounds, showing that she still is in good condition. As her weight indicates, she is a strong, rugged, good-sized, well built cow — a cow that can do lots of work— eat large quantities of coarse, rough feed, like alfalfa and corn silage and yet be healthy and vigorous, ready to repeat the performance. KShe is in fine condition physically and was bred four months ago and safe in calf. She has never been particularly crowded as we were anxious that under no circumstances should she be injured by over-feed - ing. She is a daughter of La May, once state champion cow, whose record was 26,660 pounds of milk and 966 pounds of butter. Her sire was Sir Prince Mercedes De Kol, perhaps the bes.t transmitter of dairy characteristics we have ever had in the Dairy Husbandry Department. It is interesting to note even though La May herself was a record pro - ducer, her mating with this sire produced La Verna, a much better typed cow, with a milk record of 2694 pounds more than her dam and a butter record of over 344 pounds more than her dam. Many have asked about her product and how it was disposed of. In answer to this, it may be said that the University Dairy Department re - tails all the milk from the herd right at the dairy, at the rate of fourteen cents a quart. As La Verna in her year's production gave 29.555 pounds of milk, which roughly speaking is 13,746 quarts of milk, her product at fourteen cents a quart gave the department the neat sum of $1,924.44 for the year which should leave a good profit even after feed, and all other expenses have been taken care of. There is another lesson to be learned from a cow like this when we compare her output with that of the average cow. In the midwest the average record is not to exceed 4,000 pounds of milk and 150 pounds of butter. Dairy workers find many people apparently quite satisfied with this yield and too often there is a lack of interest in suggestions for more cow testing work or the more extensive use of good pure-bred sires. It would be Impractical to suggest that all cows can be made to pro- ifarch 3024.5 102.228 2739.5 2726.0 2508 . 7 101.362 93.227 94.076 fuly 2471.3 Vugust 2299.1 88.067 78.399 </seg>

In Nebraska, alone we have about 700,000 dairy cows and if their productions were doubled it would mean much to our agricultural re - sources. The application of these simple principles have largely been re - sponsible for discovering such cows as Katy Gerben, Roxanna, Kittle Gerben, La May and La Verna, and it is these same principles that makes it possible here at the University Farm now to report that 37 cows of all dairy breeds and all ages that have completed authenticated tests averaging 12,026.2 pounds of milk containing 491.31 pounds' of fat equivalent to an average of 614 pounds of butter in 365 days. The story of this wonderful cow's production would not be complete without a word about the man who has so unselfishly and faithfully labored that this cow might have "her chance." During the almost ten years I have been Head of the Dairy Department, I have come to know his ability and devotion to his work more than I can well express and it is with peculiar pleasure that I take this opportunity of expressing my appreciation to Mr. N. Anderson. It was he who milked, fed and cared for this cow in addition to his many other duties as herdsman. As an example of the exactness called for in the care of this cow, it may be said that she has been milked four times a day ever since she came fresh, milking time coming at 4:30 in the morning, again at 11:00 A. M., at 5:00 P. M. and at 11:00 P. M. — it came on Sundays and other holidays exactly the same as on other days. Mr. Anderson, during this entire test hardly missed a milking. He has had a lot of other work to do, but has never been too busy to look after her feeding or other care which she needed. Needless to say, he has had to deny himself the pleasure of going to parties, to the movies, or to other entertainments. He, at all times', has taken the keenest in - terest and enjoyment in caring for this cow, and has watched with pleasure and eager expectancy her remarkable performance from day to day. It Is therefore a pleasure for me at this time to acknowledge our gratitude to Mr. Anderson our herdsman. </seg>

Frandsen That Nature has been lavish in showering upon the midwest abun - dant crops of all kinds of food materials is evident to even the most casual observer. Everywhere we have had rich harvests of wheat, oats, corn, alfalfa and other fodder stuffs of various kinds. It seemed as if nature tried in one year to make up for the shortcomings of several seasons. Indeed, the early harvest season held out wonderful prospects for all farmers the country over. Then came the sudden collapse in prices — farm products being the first to hit the decline and to such an extent that the farmer is facing the most serious post-war problem he has been called upon to cope with thus far. Relief measures of many kinds are now on foot to help the farmer hold his wheat and corn until a better market can be obtained. What will be the outcome of these various schemes is still problematical, but it is safe to say that they cannot solve the problem for every individual farmer. There are in many cases, large crops of corn, alfalfa and other fodder stuffs which must be put to immediate use. Dairying a Safe Development Just here is where the dairy cow can be of much assistance. It is true that in the last few years her numbers have been decreased some - what because of the scarcity and- high price of labor and the fact that a satisfactory return for farm operations has been realized by selling grains direct as a result of the abnormally high prices. However, the dairy cow has not been entirely eliminated, but has gone on peacefully chewing her cud and biding her time to take her place again as one of the most useful factors, and perhaps the safest, in developing a perma - nent agricultural prosperity for the great plains' country. The situation we are facing today is not so very different from the experiences that are yet within the memory of the pioneers of Nebraska. Sometimes due to drouth and crop failures, sometimes to low prices and general hard times, Nebraska would have labeled a near-failure agricul - turally had it not been for the faithful dairy cow. Many times, in the past, when the "bottom dropped out" of the wheat market or of the corn, oats or hay market — or when the grasshoppers took the wheat and the hot winds the corn — many a farmer managed through the dairy cow, to pay the grocery bills and other urgent expenses and in many cases even laid the foundation for his future success. Dairy Cow Supplies Market When an era of low prices comes such as we are facing today, it is a problem with many a farmer not in a position to hold his crops, to find a market which will yield adequate returns on his investment. Ex - periences of the past teach us that no safer market can he found than the dairy cow. She will take the abundant roughages which have been </seg>
            <seg id="p116">THIRTY-SIXTH ANNUAL CONVENTION 117 produced this year, together with some of the small grain and corn and by turning them into milk, return a price much greater than can be ob - tained in the open market for grains and roughages. Surely we have not reached our highest degree of thrift and efficiency so long as we are content to sell these grains and roughages as such, to be fed to dairy cows in the eastern states or even in foreign countries. That dairying will hold a more and more Important place in the nation's agriculture there can be no question. Enough data on milk pro - duction has been gathered to prove conclusively that the dairy cow pro - duces human food more cheaply than any other animal on the farm; furthermore, that no other animal can take the roughage, hay, grasses, corn fodder and corn silage, and the by-products from our food factories and mills, all of which in themselves are not fit for human food, and in return give so much nourishing human foodstuff. For example, it has been shown that one cow, if slaughtered, will provide sufficient meat for two persons for one year, while the milk from the same cow will yield equivalent food material for 20 persons for one year. To show further the ecnomy of the dairy cow, it is of interest to know that Katy Gerben, a University of Nebraska dairy cow, has, in seven consecutive milking periods, produced as much digestible food material as is contained in the carcasses of 47 steers. Also the fact should not be overlooked that dairying contributes in large measure to the direct beef output of the nation by the slaughter of superannuated dairy animals and the baby beef not needed for breeding purposes. Statistics tell us that practically all of Denmark's beef supply comes from this source. How large a per cent of our meat supply is obtained in this way, we have no figures to prove, but it is safe to say that it is large enough to count as an im - portant factor. During the last few years while there has been a ready market and good profits in all the easier lines of work, dairying naturally has suffered because of the more exacting methods and additional labor which it re - quires. Consequently there has been no greater production than neces - sary to meet immediate demands. The person interested in the future of dairying naturally would be. in - terested in knowing how much milk is produced in this country and how it supplies our needs. Prom recent government reports it is noted that the amount of milk produced by all the cows in the United States was 84,611,350,000 pounds. Of this amount 36,500,000,000 pounds or forty-three and one-tenth per cent was consumed as whole milk. Forty-one per cent or 34,663,850,000 pounds were used for making butter, producing, roughly speaking, 1,650,000,000 pounds. Five per cent of this milk, or 4,400,000,000 pounds are used annually for the making of cheese, producing last year 420,000,000 pounds. Four and three-tenths per cent or 3,660.000,000 pounds were used for feeding calves during the year. Three and seven - tenths per cent or 3,150,000,000 pounds of this milk were used for the. making of 210,000,000 gallons of ice cream. Two and nine-tenths per cent </seg>
            <seg id="p117">118 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION or 2,447,500,000 pounds of milk were used for making 975,000,000 pounds of condensed milk. These figures indicate that while seemingly a large amount of milk is used, this is really not a large amount when we con- sider our hundred million population, as this provides only about 340 pints per year per person, or less than a pint a day. Children, nutrition experts tell us, should receive not less than a quart of milk a day to in- sure proper mental and physical growth. In addition to the particular value of food elements in milk, it may be stated that from an economic viewpoint, milk at present prices is cheaper than most other foods. In spite of the fact that there are many reasons why dairy products should figure more extensively in our diet, we find that Americans have been slower than other nations to recognize the extent to which dairy products should be used. This is indicated by the statistics gathered by the United States Dairy Division which shows the follwing yearly per capita consumption of butter in various countries: Australia consumes 26 lbs. New Zealand consumes 1 22 lbs. Denmark consumes 19 lbs. United States ." consumes 17 lbs. United Kingdom consumes 19 lbs. Canada .' consumes 16 lbs. Norway consumes 14 lbs. Netherlands consumes 11 lbs. As regards cheese, this fact is brought out even more strikingly: Denmark consumes 12 lbs. per capita United Kingdom consumes 10 lbs. per capita Netherlands ..'••. consumes 8 lbs. per capita Norway consumes 7 lbs. per capita Switzerland consumes 5 lbs. per capita Italy consumes 5 lbs. per capita Australia consumes 5 lbs. per capita United States ...consumes 4 lbs. per capita Canada consumes 3 lbs. per capita New Zealand consumes 3 lbs. per capita Argentine consumes 3 lbs. per capita These facts are all the more significant when we remember that Americans as a nation are heavier eaters than most other peoples. The man looking to the future demands for dairy products, however, may get much encouragement from the fact that the work of our best physicians, scientists and progressive dairymen in preaching the merits of dairy products is gradually bearing fruit. This is indicated by a survey carried on by the Department of Agriculture which shows that Americans are now eating about eight per cent less of meat than they did twenty years ago — and that six per cent more of dairy products are being consumed than twenty years ago. It is encouraging to know that gradually the </seg>
            <seg id="p118">THIRTY-SIXTH ANNUAL CONVENTION 119 consumers of our nation are learning the lesson, that milk and milk products are more healthful sources of food than meat. Authorities tell us that considerably more dairy products, more vegetables and fruit, with less meat should figure in our meals. Dr. Sherman of Columbia University presents the following table, showing the present per cent of expenditures for food of various kinds and his suggestion as to what percentage would be more desirable: Recommended Present as more deair- per cent able per cent It can readily be seen that along with the gradual education of our people to the use of a maximum amount of milk, butter, cheese and ice cream in their diet — there must be an increased production — in fact a production more than double the present output, in order to fill the in - creased demand. This fact alone should be encouraging to the man with the dairy cow. 0 The advent of prohibition in this country also lends an encouraging aspect to the dairy business. Authentic reports show that something like $35.00 per capita were spent annually for liquor. That ice cream and milk drinks will replace a large amount of this, there can be no doubt. Some authorities claim that the demand for these products will easily be doubled. If the present consumption of ice cream requires the milk and cream from 900,000 cows, the new demand will easily require the product of an additional million cows. The increased demand for all kinds of dairy products which is sure to come as a result of the dis - semination of facts regarding their food values will likely call for the product of at least another ten million cows. These facts alone ought to make the outlok for the future of dairying very encouraging. Very recently we are hearing about over production of dairy prod - ucts — perhaps the scarcity of these products during the last few years and high prices have made us forget their real merits, and often perhaps we have been careless as regards their quality. Too often we have neglected telling others about the necessity of using more milk and butter and cheese in the diet. Nut margarine, oleomargarine and Hebe are extravagantly advertised in nearly every paper. Not only have we not advertised our dairy products but many times we have set a bad example for our observing friends by using so-called butter substitutes on our own tables.

            <seg id="p119">120 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION could be wiped out in a single day if every person in the United States would double their consumption of dairy products. That the consumption of milk and other dairy products could be largely increased can easily be seen from statistics gathered from various parts of the country. For instance, the Oregon Dairy Council reports that 20 per cent of the children of Portland are getting no milk, that 37 per cent of the rural children in Oregon are without milk. In our own city of Lincoln, 30 per cent of the people in a certain district use no butter. Many farmers use oleo In place of butter. Milk and Better Children One of the examples to prove the food value of milk is that given by Dr. Clouse, school physician of Columbus, Ind. He made a careful survey of all the children in this school and found 75 per cent under weight, evidently under nourished. The condition was not due to poverty but generally due to lack of proper understanding of child nutrition. In many cases the children were found to consume liberally of pickles, pastry, doughnuts and candy, while the needed desirable foods like dairy products, were often found wanting. Following these reports' the school people started a mid-forenoon lunch each day where the children received one-half pint of milk and a bread and butter sandwich. The children each brought the sandwich and the milk was delivered to the school at a cost of fifteen cents a week for each child. Dr. Clouse reports*, remarkable results. The results' of the experi - ment were highly interesting, both as regards physical ability and mental efficiency. Dr. Clouse says, "The children were weighed after four weeks and the average gain for three months was twelve and three-tenths ounces per month against the normal weight of six ounces for the normal child the country over. One girl gained five pounds during three weeks as against four and one-half ounces normal." As to the effect that this luncheon had on the school work, Dr. Clouse says, "The children did better work, their minds seemed keener and more alert, they grasped their studies more easily and did better work." Work of this kind if adopted generally throughout Nebraska schools would doubtless be of inestimable value to a great number of children, and incidentally would put a large part of the surplus milk to the best possibe use. When an era of lower prices comes, as it has, the man in the dairy business will find himself in better shape to withstand the crisis than those engaged in other lines of farming. This has been proved again and again in this, as well as in older countries. Surely here in the great midwest, where the grains and roughage used by the dairy cow grow in such abundance, we have not reached our highest degree of thrift and efficiency as long as we are content to sell these grains and roughages u such, to be fed to dairy cows in the eastern states or in foreign countries.
