Cutting alfalfa hay for aged pregnant ewes increased the feed con - sumption, increased the gains, and decreased the amount of Feed required for 100 pounds of gain. ".'■•• 2. Lambs fed a high-protein grain mixture gained .0 1 pound per hear! daily more before weaning and .08 pound after 'weaning than 1 similar lambs fed a grain mixture relatively low in protein. 3. Over twice as much grain was required for 100 pounds of gain by early lambs after weaning as was required before weaning. 4. Each ewe consumed, in approximately six months, 5.6. bushels of ear corn, ground; 10 pounds of cottonseed meal; 20i&gt; pounds of corn silage; 230 pounds of cut alfalfa; and .57 pounds of alfalfa hay. During this time each ewe. gained 20 pounds.' 5. Each lamb marketed ate 1.4 bushels of shelled corn, ground: 11 pounds each of linseed meal and bran;, and 71 pounds of alfalfa hay. 6. Of the 21 G lambs marketed, 121 were from 100 ewes bred in Nebraska and 95 from 100 ewes bred in Colorado. The Colorado - bred lambs averaged 65 pounds and brought .$11.52 per hundred - weight at Omaha, while the Nebraska-bred lambs averaged 71 pounds and sold at $11.28 per hundredweight. Time of marketing was responsible for the difference in selling price: 3-1 per cont of the Colorado-bred lambs were sold before Easter, while less than 5 per cent of the Nebraska-bred lambs were ready for market at that • 1 time. . 7. The Colorado-bred ewes lambed seven days earlier, on the average, than the Nebraska-bred. As a result, more of them were sold in April at a higher price than was paid for fat ewes in May and June. 8. Single lambs weighed more at birth and gained more rapidly than twins. 9. Wool returned enough to. pay for only 17 per cent of the feed con - sumed by the ewes. </seg>
            <seg id="p003">Raising Early Lambs from Aged Western Ewes A. D. WEBER Many farm flocks in Nebraska are comprised of aged western ewes. They are easily obtained because of the state's geographical position with reference to the sheep-producing sections of the West and the leading feeder lamb markets. Nebraska ranks second in number of western lambs fed. This also tends to acquaint farmers with range sheep. FACTORS AFFECTING EARLY LAMB PRODUCTION AGE OF EWES Farm flocks in Nebraska are largely on a one-year basis. In other words, ewes culled from range flocks because of their age, poor teeth, and, unfortunately for beginners, emaciation and spoiled udders, are purchased in the fall and marketed the following spring or summer after their lambs are weaned. Where this method is followed the ewe lambs are marketed because they sell for more per head than old ewes cost. Furthermore, aged ewes produce two marketable products the first year, lambs and wool. Ewe lambs, on the other hand, produce only wool the first year since it is not advisable, in view of the danger of losses from difficult parturition, to breed them to lamb before they are two years old. TIME OF LAMBING These old ewes are commonly known as "one-year" or "broken-mdutlied" ewes. Widely difTei-ent methods 'are used in handling them. Some 4'armers feed grain liberally while others depend chiefly upon coarse roughages and pasture. Altho the time of lambing ranges from January to May, early lamb production is increasing in popularity. Early lambs are born in January and February and marketed before June 15. Many outstanding lamb producers follow this method. It is obvious that early lambs have advantages over late lambs. They are marketed before midsummer heat and stomach worms affect them. They are usually out of the way before corn plowing, harvesting, and haying', when it is dif - ficult to give livestock close attention. ; The pasture problem is also eliminated inasmuch as early lambs are raised in dry lots. SPRING LAMB PRICES Early lambs are marketed after most of the fed "westerns" have been sold and before the new crop of range lambs begins to arrive in large numbers. As a result, these youngsters, termed spring lambs at the markets, sell at comparatively high prices. Their position is strengthened by the Greek holiday festivities during April, which increase the demand for lamb. Spring lamb is considered a delicacy in the East and is especially in demand at Easter. </seg>

I. — Average weekly top prices of fat ewes and lambs at Omaha, April to July, li)2 1-1 1&gt;30 — ;nicc quotations alter May 15 on n shovn basis. Altho spring lambs sell at. attractive prices during April, Figure 1 shows that, while prices recede somewhat, they re - main at a relatively high level until June 15. It was not possible to include April price quotations for spring lambs in the ten-year average given in Figure 1 because only occa - sional sales during that month were made at Omaha from 1921 to 1927. However, they sold at a premium whenever offered. Beginning with the first market day in June, fed lambs are classed as yearlings and spring lambs are called fat lambs. By referring again to Figure. 1, it can be seen that the spread in price between these two classes gradually widens after June 1, altho the trend is downward in both cases. DATE OF BREEDING It is not an easy matter to produce lambs for the Easter market. .One reason is that often it is impossible to buy good range ewes on the open market in time to get them bred for January lambing. Even when available, they may not breed in August if the nights are exceedingly hot. In order to </seg>
            <seg id="p005">Raising Early Lambs &gt;bviate this possibility, a few large operators buy ewes on he range and take them to a high altitude in Colorado for he summer where they are bred to lamb in December and ranuary. Western sheepmen cannot afford to sort and sell imall bunches. In recent years, however, dealers have made small lots of bred ewes available by selling them at auctions n September or October. FAT EWE PRICES But irrespective of the time and place bred, these old ewes ire seldom fat enough in the fall to attract packer competi - ion. As a matter, of fact, from 1922 to 1929 they sold for :onsiderably more as breeders than they would have brought for. slaughter purposes. Many of them would be classed as "canhers" or "throw-outs" from a carcass standpoint. Unless fattened by the time they are sold, the following spring or summer they sell at cull ewe prices. Whether or not it is better to fatten t lie ewes after lambing is an undecided ques - tion. Obviously it is difficult to fatten a, ewe suckling a lamb. Fattening the ewes is not the only problem, however. There is a time limit which must be taken into account if fat ewes are to yield the greatest monetary return. Figure 1 shows very clearly the average drop in the price of fat ewes which occurred after May 15 at Omaha for the ten-year period from u ij_l I i — | — i — i — ! — j — i — | — r~ tZ ,&lt; \\ --J 01CA.TES IO VP.

            <seg id="p006">Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 250 1921 to 1930. The price, which is for good to choice ewes, remained above $8.50 per hundredweight until the first week in May. From that time until the middle of June it receded to $5.30. In other words, the top price for fat ewes at Omaha dropped practically fifty cents a week for seven weeks be - ginning May 1. Thus good 130-pound fat ewes returned, as an average for the ten years, $10.90 each May 1, but only $6.90 each June 15. It should be noted, however, that prices are on a wooled basis until May 15. Figure 2^shows that, while yearly prices fluctuated greatly, the same general trend was observed each year. The decline started early in April in 1922 and 1924. In 1921 and 1930. prices remained fairly constant until the last of May. But in spite of slight deviations from the average trend, the low mark for each of. the ten years was reached about the middle of June. Early lamb production is a specialized business rn Nebraska because of the intensive methods of feeding that are necessary to take advantage of the favorable prices- in April and May. It is really a combined breeding and feeding .proposition. When the ewes are bred in Colorado, feeding is the primary consideration except for a few weeks at lambing time. Even then the judicious use of feeds plays a prominent part. OBJECTS OF THE EXPERIMENT Numerous inquiries have been received by the Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station for information relative. to the amount and kind of feed necessary when early lambs are raised from "one-year" or "broken-mouthed" western ewes. But very little experimental work has been done in an attempt to answer such questions. It was deemed advisable, there - fore, to feed and care for the ewes and lambs in the experi - ment reported herein in much the same manner followed by successful sheepmen. It is believed that the data are par - particularly valuable from the . standpoint that they show what can be expected from this method of producing early lambs. It should be clearly understood that no attempt has been made to find a method that excels the one now generally used. . • Since the success or failure of an undertaking of this kind is thought to depend upon whether the ewes are fat or thin when marketed, they were fed grain liberally, both before and after lambing. The feed records and notes on performance are first in importance. However, it is believed that helpful information was obtained from the following tests, the ob - jects of which were : 1. To compare ewes bred in Colorado with ewes bred in Nebraska, </seg>
            <seg id="p007">Raising Early Lambs 2. To determine whether cut or whole alfalfa should be fed with ground ear corn to pregnant ewes, 3. To compare a high-protein grain mixture with one rela - tively low in protein when fed with alfalfa hay to suck - ling lambs. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE • SHEEP USED On August 27, 1929, 100 aged white-faced Idaho ewes were purchased on the Omaha market. They averaged 123 pounds and cost $9.48 each laid down at Lincoln. They were bred to three purebred Hampshire rams raised in the University flock. Another group of 100 aged white-faced ewes was purchased at an auction on October 2, 1929. These ewes originated in Wyoming, but with their lambs were taken to Colorado about the middle of June where they were grazed the remainder of the summer. Black-faced rams were with these ewes from July 15 to September 20. The lambs were marketed August 15. Each ewe was charged into the experiment at $8.68, the average price paid for 1,500 head at this auction. The two groups were similar in type and conformation. Practically all were high-grade Rambouillets, with the excep - tion of two ewes . purchased at auction. These were black - ' ■-■■.. ■ • • ■ :■ ■.-■■:■ i '"■■■' i ' ! . . ■ . . - ' : ' ' .' i . : ■ '! - ! Fig. 3.— Lot 1 ewes. These ewes were fed ground ear corn and alfalfa hay during pregnancy. </seg>

On the whole, the ewes purchased at auction were hardly as uniform or rugged as those purchased at Omaha. The' ewes and their Iambs are designated "Nebraska-bred" and "Colorado-bred" in the discussion of results. QUALITY OF FEEDS • Yellow ear corn was fed. During the first 60 days it aver - aged 18.2 per cent moisture and for the remainder of the experiment 15 per cent. The shelled corn was mostly white and averaged 15.8 per cent moisture. The silage, made from corn averaging thirty bushels per acre, was of excellent quality. The alfalfa was good leafy, third-cutting hay. The minimum protein content of the other feeds used was guar - anteed by the manufacturers to be as follows: bran 15 per cent, cottonseed meal 43 per cent, and linseed meal 34 per cent. FEED PRICES The total feed requirement of each ewe and lamb is of much greater importance in an experiment of this kind than the cost of gain, either total or for any given period. For this reason, feed cost by periods is not included. Altho the total feed cost is given, it is probably of doubtful value be - cause the price of feeds fluctuates widely from year to year. The flock owner will derive the greatest benefit from these data if he interpx-ets them in accordance with his own condi - tions. Feed costs can be easily calculated by multiplying the feed requirements by existing prices. </seg>
            <seg id="p009">Raising Early Lambs The feed prices used in this experiment were: Ground ear corn $ 1-10 per hundredweight Ground shelled corn 1.35 per hundredweight Linseed meal 60.00 per ton Cottonseed meal : : 50.00 per ton Bran 25.00 per ton Corn silage 6.00 per ton Cut alfalfa 17.12 per ton . Alfalfa .....:... 15.00 per ton SHELTER PROVIDED j No shelter was provided until Oqtober 23. On this date the 'ewes were divided into two groups of 100 each. Each group was fed in a lot 30 by 100 feet and had access to an open shed facing south, with shed space 22 by 30 feet.' Beginning at lambing time the shed and lot areas were doubled. A closed lambing room 20 by 30 feet was available during cold weather. METHOD OF FEEDING The ewes were fed grain and roughage in bunks in the open. The lambs were fed in creeps under the shed. All rations were hand-fed regularly at 7:30 A. M. and 4:30 P. M. WEIGHING AND MARKETING Individual weights of each ewe and lamb were taken on three consecutive days at the beginning and conclusion of each phase of the experiment. The averages of these weights were considered as the initial .and final weights respectively. Two exceptions occurred. The weights, of the ewes taken be - fore lambing were the averages of three group weights taken on consecutive days. The birth weights of the lambs repre - sent, single weighings taken soon after each lamb was born. In every case the ewes and' lambs were shipped on the evening of the day the last experimental weight was taken. Shrinkage in shipment was calculated from the average of the three final experimental weights. EXPERIMENTAL DATA The. figures in each phase of an experiment of this kind are of value only when analyzed in the light of data available at the conclusion of the experiment. So far as possible, the in - formation is presented in the order in which it was obtained and its significance expressed in terms of the final results. PASTURE PERIOD The Nebraska-bred ewes were pastured on blue grass and also on weeds and quack grass that had made a luxuriant growth in a stubble field until October 24, or 59 days. The three purebred Hampshire rams were with them until Octo - ber 17. No grain was fed during this period. </seg>
            <seg id="p010">Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 250 The Colorado-bred ewes were in the same pasture from October 5 until October 24, or 19 days. Ewes bred in Colorado are generally purchased later than those bred in Nebraska, which reduces the time they must be kept on the farm. Ram charges are eliminated since they are bred before they arrive, but this may be a disadvantage in. view of the fact that the farmer has never seen the rams. The ewes remained thrifty thruout the pasture period. No deaths occurred. FEEDING DURING PREGNANCY On October 23 the 200 ewes were divided into two equal lots, each containing an equal number from the original groups. They were fed for 60 days on the following rations: Lot I — Alfalfa hay and ground ear corn, Lot 2 — Alfalfa cut in one-half inch lengths and ground ear corn. The old saying, "A sheep which cant grind its own feed isn't worth keeping," is probably true in the case of lambs. Most of the so-called one-year breeding ewes, however, have very poor teeth. Some of the ewes in this experiment were known as "gummers" because their incisors were worn down to the gums Or had dropped out. The molars, used in grind - ing, were badly worn. . This ration test was an attempt to determine whether cutting the hay would prove beneficial when fed to broken-mouthed ewes.

            <seg id="p011">Raising Early Lambs The detailed results are given in Table 1. The average initial weight was 125 pounds in both lots. At the end of the 60-day feeding period, the ewes in Lot 2, which had re - ceived cut hay, averaged 152 pounds as contrasted with an average weight of 144 pounds in Lot 1 where whole hay was fed. Cutting the hay apparently caused an 8-pound greater gain in 60 days. This difference in gain was made in spite of the fact that the average daily ration of ground ear corn was the same in both lots, 1.58 pounds. However, the ewes in Lot 2 consumed approximately one-fourth pound more cut alfalfa per head daily than Lot 1 consumed of whole hay. This greater total feed consumption perhaps explains the larger gains made by Lot 2. It should be noted that it was impossible to get the ewes in Lot 1 to eat as much whole hay as Lot 2 consumed of cut alfalfa. The feed required for 100 pounds' of gain was lower in both lots than we would ordinarily expect with aged ewes. In fact. Lot 2 required no more feed for 100 pounds of gain than is usually required by western lambs. The data indicate that cutting alfalfa hay increased the feed consumption, increased the gains, and decreased the amount of feed required for 100 pounds of gain. Altho this test was only 60 days long, the number of ewes in each lot should strengthen our belief that cutting the hay paid. But before accepting the results as conclusive evidence that this is true, let us observe what the Table 2. — Gains and lambing records of ewes fed different rations before lambing and identical rations after lambing .

            <seg id="p012">Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 250 two groups did following this test when they were fed identical rations. Table 2 shows that Lot 1, fed whole hay before lambing, made an average gain of 2 pounds from before lambing until mai-keted. Lot 2, on the other hand, lost 4 pounds during the same period. In other words, Lot 2 weighed only 3 pounds per head more when marketed, whereas the difference was 8 pounds prior to lambing. Cutting 130 pounds of hay, there - tore, increased the gain 3 pounds. A charge of $2.12 per ton was made for cutting, which means that it cost 14 cents to cut 130 pounds. The 3 pounds extra gain was worth approx- i mat ?.£ 16 cents - Hence - so far as cost of gain is concerned, the difference between the two lots is not significant It will be noted from Table 2 that the average lambing date for Lot 1 was January 29, while it was Januarv 25 for Lot 2. This, together with the fact that only 5 ewes lambed in Lot 1 prior to January 15 as against 13 in Lot 2. is prob - ably responsible for a part of the greater gain made by Lot 2. in the 60-day period before lambing. Averaging the gains made by the two lots, we find that each ewe weighed 3 pounds more before lambing thai, she did when marketed. This should not be construed to mean that a loss in weight was registered during the suckling period, since each ewe lambing gave birth to approximately 14 pounds of lamb. The average gain during lactation was 11 pounds, it we take the weights of lambs at birth into eon sideration, while the gain before lambing was 115 pounds These figures indicate that liberal feeding before lambimr helps to get the ewes ready for market. The results alsS show that cutting the hay may help in attaining thh end particularly if the ewes have poor teeth or are unusually thin! LAMBING PERIOD Beginning December 23, the ewes were fed together The first ewe, a Colorado-bred, lambed December 31. The ewes were fed as indicated in Table 1 until they lambed. Most of them lambed in a closed shed and were kept there three or four days At no time were the ewes with lambs allowed to run with those that had not lambed. They were brought to a lull feed at an average of approximately two weeks after parturition. The standard ration fed all ewes at that time was: ground shelled corn, 3 pounds; cottonseed meal 15 po JJ£ d; , cor , n . Slla ge, 2 pounds; and cut alfalfa, 1 pound The lambing records are given in Table 3. The Nebraska - bred ewes gave birth to 143 lambs, 7 of which were dead at birth. Of the 118 lambs dropped by the CoSo-bred grou P 10 were dead at birth. There were 5 barren Nebraska-bred ewes, while 11 of the Colorado-bred failed to lamb which </seg>

            <seg id="p016">Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 250 the lambs were mostly singles because the rams were with the Colorado ewes while the previous crop of lambs was still nursing. The lambing records support this contention; very few twins were born before January 20. It is also possible that the succulent pasture provided for the Nebraska-bred ewes put them in better condition. Regardless of the reasons for this difference, it has been noted in other bands of ewes handled in a like manner and may be significant. Altho the Nebraska-bred ewes did not start lambing until January 21, the average date of lambing was January 31, or only seven days later than for the Colorado-bred ewe's-: Whether as uniform a bunch oj Iambs as this from the stand - point of age can be expected over a period of years is not known. DOCKING AND CASTRATING The lambs were docked when from seven to.teii days old. Pincers, applied at a dull red heat, were used as illustrated in Figures 5 and (&gt;. As a precautionary measure, .some flock owners prefer .'to use a board, with a hole in it the size of a lamb's tail. The tail is pulled- 'thru this hole and the In i pincers applied next to the board, This eliminates the pos - sibility of burning- the lambs but is not necessary after onv has had a little experience in performing the operation. There is considerable difference of opinion as io the proper method of docking lambs:' Some uso a pocket knife; others prefer sheep shears or a hatchet. Altho the wound: heals more slowly when hot pincers arc used, the- searing reduces losses from bleeding. The important thing, however, is noi the method used but that .the tails be removed. Lambs that are docked present a squarer anil- more atirm tive appearance when marketed. They sell at enVuigii higher price than long-tailed ones to more than pay.for the trouble involved. The lambs are castrated when about two-weeks old. The; methods used by Shepherd Esry are illustrated in Figures 7. 8, arid 9. There is no discrimination against buck lambs until the first day in June when spring lambs are called fat lambs. On that date bucks sell at $1.00 per hundredweight under similar wether lambs. It is a good plan to castrate all the ram lambs, however, because it is impossible to tell at the time a lamb should be castrated just when he will be ready for market. It is sometimes necessary to carry a few lambs until August or September. Ram lambs become coarse and lack finish by that time and are severely discriminated against by both packers and feeders.

It is believed that when fed grain in a creep where the ewes cannot enter, lambs gain more rapidly than if they are wholly dependent upon their mother's milk. All of the lambs in this experiment were creep fed. In order to determine whether a grain mixture high in protein excels one low in protein, two lots were fed the following rations, by weight, for 112 days: Lot 1— Ground shelled corn, 14 parts; bran, 2 parts; lin - seed meal, 1 part; and alfalfa hay. Lot: 2— -Ground shelled corn, 12 parts; bran, 2 parts; lin - seed meal, 3 parts.; and alfalfa hay.

In allotting the lambs, the large early lambs and the late ones were not used. The results of this ration test are given in Table 4. The test started when the lambs were two weeks old and averaged 17 pounds in weight. The total feed consumed was prac - tically the same for both lots. However, the average daily ration in Lot 2 contained three times as much linseed meal as the one in Lot 1, or .19 pound and .06 pound respectively. At the close, Lot 2 had made an average gain of 59 pounds as compared with 54 pounds in Lot 1. Thus, the liberal feeding of linseed meal increased the average daily gain .05 of a pound. ■,-•'■ ■ ■ . ■■ '..'•'■. ■ •' "•■■'•"' ■ ■■'■■■■. •••'.'

This advantage in price indicates that the Lot 2 lambs were fatter than those in Lot 1. The lambs in these two lots were weaned after being creep - fed 84 days. They were continued on the same rations 28 days longer. . The average daily gain in Lot 2 was .04 pound more than in Lot 1 before weaning and .08 pound more after weaning. One pound of linseed meal replaced .94 pound of ground shelled corn, and .44 pound of alfalfa hay while the lambs were suckling, but after weaning the replacement value increased to 2.6 pounds of ground shelled corn, .2 pound of bran, and .7 pound of alfalfa hay. These data indicate that a high-protein mixture gave greater returns when fed after weaning than before, doubtless because of the amount and quality of protein in ewes' milk.

            <seg id="p020">Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 250 figures are misleading unless we realize that a considerable portion of the ewes' ration goes to make milk, and should, therefore, be charged to the lambs. When viewed in this way it would seem logical, because of the rate and economy of gains made by the lambs weaned when 100 days old, to sell the ewes about May 1 when prices average relatively high. Not only will the. total feed cost be reduced if this is done, but the lambs sell practically as well June 1 as May 1. (See . ! Figure 1.)

The ewes in these two lots were th« clams of the lambs used in the creep-feeding - test just discussed. No attempt was made to allot the ewes on the basis of weight or conformation, altho they were quite similar in these respects. Thrift and ability to do a good job of suckling a lamb were given close attention, however. The average daily ration was approximately the same: ground ear corn, 3 pounds; cottonseed meal, .15 pound; corn silage, almost 2.4 pounds; and cut alfalfa, 1 pound. Despite the similarity in the rations, Lot 1 gained .01 pound more per head daily than Lot 2. As a result of this greater gain, Lot. 1 required less feed for 100 pounds of gain. These differences in rate and economy of gain of ewes fed similar rations illus - trate their inherent variability, and may explain, in part, the striking differences sometimes obtained when dissimilar feeds are compared. ■ l - . ■ • ■ . • ■ </seg>

            <seg id="p022">Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 250 amount of feed consumed by these youngsters per unit of gain is surprisingly low when compared with that required by old ewes. As was stated previously, it is a common practice to feed one-year ewes heavily on grain during lactation. But does it pay? It is hoped that the answer will be found in the results of experiments which will be conducted during the next few years at this station. Until a better and more economical method is found, however, it would seem logical to use', the one followed in this experiment. FEED DATA ON ALL. LAMBS The lambs from the Nebraska-bred and Colorado-bred ewes were fed similar rations and given the same treatment in every respect. Table 7 gives the data on both bunches of lambs. All lambs were started on grain in a creep at the same time. The lambs from the Colorado-bred ewes averaged seven days older than those from the Nebraska-bred owes, which accounts for their greater weight at the time they were started on grain. Being older, they ate more grain at the start, and as a result the average daily ration was kept the same. Table 7 shows that the Nebraska-bred lambs made an average daily gain of .52 pound while it was .02 pound loss. or .50 pound, for the Colorado lambs.

            <seg id="p023">Raising Early Lambs greater daily gain made by the Nebraska-breds is of doubt - ful significance; Neither was there much difference in the feed required for 100 pounds of gain. Here again the feed per unit of gain is surprisingly low, which further emphasizes the wisdom of creep feeding early lambs. Of course, the feed consumed directly by the lambs is only a small part of the total cost of getting them ready for market. But since this is true it would certainly be un - wise not to use such an inexpensive aid in crowding lambs for the" early market. EFFECT OF SEX AND TWINNING The data found in Table 8 were compiled in the belief that they might be of interest, but they are probably of little prac - tical value. The single lambs not only weighed more at birth but gained almost one-tenth of a pound per head daily more than the twin lambs. They weighed as much as the twins when marketed in spite of the fact that they averaged three weeks younger. A few flock owners feed the ewes with twins separately from those with singles. These men also report that very few of the twin lambs are ready for the Easter market. Altho in this experiment the singles and twins were fed. together, these data indicate that it might be advisable to feed them separately. Table 8. — The effect of sex and twinning on weight at birth, on gains, and on age when marketed : • ' Twin lambs Single lambs All !umbsi Wethers | Ewes ' Wethers I Ewes Wethers j Ewes Number of lambs marketed I 15 57 52 48 104 112 Age when marketed (r/«i/j) j 125 122 105. 105 115 115 ■Weight per lamb [pounds): Ubirth . 9.78 9.18 11.56 10.65 10.60 9.77 When marketed, 72 67 74 71 73 69 Total train 62 58 62 60 62 59 Daily gain.; , .49 .48 1 .59 j .57 .54 | .52 'Includes the single survivors of-14 pairs of tw.tns. The ram lambs averaged heavier at birth than the ewe lambs and also gained more rapidly. The difference was small but appears significant since the twins and singles performed the same in this respect. DATA ON ALL EWES Referring to Table 9, one sees that the Nebraska-bred ewes gained only 4 pounds per head more than the Colorado-bred group from October 24, when they were started on grain, until all of the ewes were marketed. The total gain per head was exceedingly low in view of the fact that for approximately </seg>
            <seg id="p024">Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 250 six months the ewes in both lots received an average daily ration of 2.21 pounds of ground ear corn, .06 pound of cotton - seed meal, 1.18 pounds of corn silage, 1.30 pounds of cut alfalfa, and .32 pound of alfalfa hay. The small gain, coupled with heavy feeding over a long period, was responsible for the large amount of feed required per 100 pounds of gain. Altho the Nebraska-bred owes made more economical gains, the significance of the difference becomes more apparent when we note that they raised 26 more lambs than were raised' by the Colorado-bred group. This, together with the fact that of the 12 ewes that died 8 were Colorado-bred, leads to, the conclusion that the Nebraska-bred ewes were stronger and made better use of their feed. It is possible, however, that the reverse might be true another year. As a matter of fact, the importance of the figures in Table 0 is not in the difference between the two groups, but is rather that over 25 bushels of ear corn ground, not to mention roughages and cottonseed meal, was required for 100 pounds of gain. It is apparent that the gains would probably never; under any set of price conditions, pay for the feed required to make them.

            <seg id="p025">Raising Early Lambs 25 It would be a mistake, therefore', to feed grain liberally for such a long period solely for the increase in weight made by the ewes before and after lambing. This method of feeding is advocated by sheepmen, however, on the grounds that (1) it puts the ewes in good condition for lambing and is con - ducive to a heavy flow, of milk and (2) most of the ewes fed iii this manner can be sold fat on or before May 15 when prices average $3.50 per hundredweight higher than seven weeks later. TOTAL FEED CONSUMED Carrying the study of feed records one step further we mid, by referring to Table 10, that each ewe purchased was charged with 5.6. uushels^bf ear corn, ground; 10 pounds of cottonseed meal;: 209 pounds of corn silage; 230 pounds of •cut alfalfa; and 57 poujidsrof alfalfa hay. It is believed that these figures represent about the maximum amount required when early lambs are produced by the method used in this experiment. In addition to. the feed consumed by the ewes, each lamb marketed ate 1.4 bushels of shelled corn, ground; 11 pounds each. of linseed meal and bran; and 74 pounds of alfalfa hay. Considering the total feed consumed by ewes and lambs, it ' would seem that approximately 7 bushels of corn, 350 pounds of alfalfa, 210 pounds of. corn silage, 20 pounds of protein supplement, and 10 pounds of bran should be supplied on the basis of each ewe purchased, anticipating, of course, a 100 - -percent lamb crop. It is interesting to note that these figures agree remarkably well with estimates of feed consumption furnished the writer by. several farmers who bought ewes in Table 10. — Total feed consumed by both groups of ewes and lambs (for entire experiment) Ewes Lambs Number of animals started on feed ' 200 226 Number of animals marketed .■ ■ 188 216 Feed consumed per animal: 1 Ear corn, ground (bushels) \ 5.6 Shelled corn, ground (bushels) 1.4 Cottonseed meal (poutids) 10 Linseed meal (pounds) ...... 11 Bran ( pounds) : 11 Corn silage (jwinids) I 209 ......

WOOL PRODUCTION All of the ewes, with the exception of the 23 head marketed February 27, were shorn between March 24 and April 3. In Nebraska, most of the ewes marketed with their lambs in April and May are shorn in March if possible. It is believed by farmers that ewes gain more rapidly after the wool is re - moved, even tho the weather is unusually cool at that time. No comparison was made in this test, however. Table 11 shows that the Nebraska-bred ewes averaged 1.5 pounds more wool than the Colorado-bred lot. The wool from the two bunches of ewes was sold as one lot at 14' •&gt; cents per pound. It is obvious that it did not pay for the feed consumed by the lambs, to say nothing of that eaten by the ewes.

            <seg id="p028">Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 250 Mention was made previously of the large amount of corn consumed by these ewes during lactation. Apparently this corn was responsible for the fact that only 11 per cent of the Nebraska-bred and 16 per cent of the Colorado-bred ewes sold as "throw-outs". Had they been fed little or no grain, it is quite likely that the majority of them would have brought from $2.00 to $3.00 per head less than they did. provided they had been marketed at the same. time. Of course, had they been marketed thirty to forty days later, they would have brought that much less, even tho they had been fed grain. Obviously time of marketing and condition of ewes' may ma - terially affect financial returns.

Both groups averaged 62 pounds, which is a popular weight prior to Easter. On May 8, six. lambs were slaughtered in the station; abattoir. The remainder of the lambs were sold June 5, the tops bringing $12.00 per hundredweight for both the Colorado-: and Nebraska-bred groups and the throw-outs $8.40 and £8.20 respectively. Table 1-1 shows that of the 216 lambs marketed, 24 per cent were "throw-outs". To state it differently, based on the 200 ewes purchased, the lamb crop was 82 nor cent good to choice lambs.

            <seg id="p029">raising Early Lambs the extra returns from the lambs would seem to justify. That, at least, is the opinion of practical farmers, and since we have no data as yet on the question, we hesitate to make a genera recommendation. It is obvious that profits depend largely upon the percentage of good to choice lambs marketed befoie JU aW the percentage of "throw-out" lambs was the same in both groups, the Colorado-bred lambs averaged 24 cents per hundredweight more than the Nebraska-bred Table 14 indicates that this difference was due to the fact that 34 pel cent of the Colorado-breds were sold on the Easter market as compared to only 5 per cent of the Nebraska-breds. This is probablv the greatest advantage to be had from breeding m Colorado over breeding in Nebraska. The lambs arrive earlier; consequently, more of them attain a marketable weight and finish in time to be sold for the Easter trade when prices are relatively high. All of the lambs marketed prior to Easter were singles, and as was mentioned previously, practically all of the Colorado-bred lambs arriving before January 20 were singles. Furthermore, Table 8 shows that the singles were larger. at birth and gained more rapidly Referring again to Table 14, it will be seen that the good to choice lambs marketed June 5 averaged 10 to 13 pounds more than those sold April 10. This is in keeping with market demands, for as the season advances the average, weight of top spring lambs gradually increases until it reaches the standard for fat lambs at 85 to 90 pounds. This should not be construed to mean that all the "throw-outs" marketed at from $8.20 to $8.40 on June 5 would have graded good on •Vpril 10 and brought $13.00. Probably some of them would have, but the majority were large "framed; hence, lack of finish was their main drawback from a carcass standpoint. Then, too, these "throw-outs" averaged only about 30 pounds April 10, which means that most of them would have sold as culls at that time. The upshot of the whole thing is that early lambs should be sold sometime between April 1 and June 15. More weight is required as the season advances, but top prices are obtained only for fat lambs irrespective of the date and weight marketed.

The figures are doubly interesting, since the shrink was approximately the same each time for all groups. Both groups of ewes averaged approximately 140 pounds at Lincoln and 130 pounds at Omaha. The shrink was 11.01 pounds, or 7.86 per cent, for the Nebraska-bred ewes, while it was 10.13, or 7.26 per cent, for the Colorado-bred.. i The Nebraska-bred lambs averaged 72.95 pounds at Lincoln and 70.72 pounds at Omaha — a shrink of 2.23 pounds, or 3.06 per cent. The Colorado-bred lambs, on the other hand, weighed five pounds less, or 67.60 pounds, at Lincoln. They shrank 2.16 pounds, or 3.20 per cent. The most interesting thing iiv connection with Table 15 is that on a percentage basis the ewes shrank over twice as much as the lambs. Neither the ewes nor the lambs received special preparation for shipping. They were fed their regular feeds in the morning, and had access to water until loaded in the evening.

            <seg id="p031">Raising Early Lambs FINANCIAL STATEMENT The financial statement given in. Table 16 reflects price conditions prevailing during 1929 and 1930. As stated pre - viously, the flock owner should interpret the results of this experiment in accordance with his own conditions, since prices of feed and sheep fluctuate from year to year. Excluding labor and equipment charges, the Nebraska-bred ewes lost $4.50 each, while the average loss for the Colorado - bred lot was $4.66. In other words, the Nebraska-bred group would not have shown a loss had they been purchased at $4.98 per head instead of $9.48. The Colorado-bred ewes, figured on the same basis, were worth $4.02 instead of $8.b8 each. The loss incurred in both lots was largely due to the unusual decline in sheep and lamb prices which occurred early in 1930 The low price of wool was also a contributing factor. It is obvious, therefore, that this system of early lamb production is not profitable when the ewes are pur - chased on. a high market in the fall and marketed with their lambs on a low market the following spring.
