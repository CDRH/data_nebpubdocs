            <seg id="p006">LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL Lincoln, Nebr.. December 31, 19SSU To Hit Excellency Samuel R. McKelvie, Governor of Nebraska: In compliance with the laws of the State of Nebraska I have the honor of submitting herewith the Seventeenth Biennial Report of the Department of Labor of this state; and in addition thereto the report of the Commissioner of the Workmen's Compensation Law as amended by the Legislature of 1917-1919, effective July 18, 1919. Respectfully, FRANK A. KENNEDY, Secretary of Labor and Compensation Commissioner. </seg>
            <seg id="p007">PART I DIVISION OF COMPENSATION Lincoln, Nebraska, December 31. 1920 Hon. Samuel R. McKelvie. Governor, State House, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Governor: The Department of Labor respectfully submits its report of ac - tivities during the years 1919-1920. as follows: Because of the human interest in the compensation department the work has been most interesting. It has' been the aim of the Sec - retary of the department tc keep his heart in the work and to inspire his assistants with the idea that the service rendered the victims of Industrial accidents in Nebraska should never become routine or mechanical Each accident, to the victim is an unfortunate occurrence in his or her life. The more serious oms are a shock to the whole force of a work shop and a further shock to the neighborhood in which the victim lives. It is not and must never be considered the same as the fire loss with its subsequent adjustment in dollars around a table. The losses adjusted in this 1 department are for hands and legs and feet and arms and eyes and lives of men and women. The compensation law is the most humane statute in the book* of law of Nebraska. It protects tens of thousands of victims of accidents in industries covered by it. whether the fault be charged to the victim, a fellow servant, or to the employer. They pour in a never ending stream through the hoppers of the adjusting departments of the insurance companies into the Department of Labor. Considering the youth of compensation law? in this country, the wonder is that so many thousands of cases are adjusted and liquidated without dispute or contest. All this, however, does not mean the Division of Compensation has had smooth sailing. The tricky adjusters' of a few insurance com - panies, and a few, very few, corporations who carry their own in - surance, practiced their arts on the Commissioner and his assistants in the early period of the term, but the total paid in compensation and medical expense during the biennium does not indicate the injured workers were the losers all the time. n </seg>
            <seg id="p008">8 SEVENTEENTH BIENNIAL REPORT The most important event of the two years' work in this depart - ment was the supreme court decision in the Perry Case, which is nnted in full in another part of this report. Soon after coming into ffice the ■lepartmeiit learned that a few insurance adjusters had been n the habit of striking sharp bargains with injured workers by making ump sum settlements for less than the law specified should be paid for oss or partial loss of members. | When the department learned of this practice it at once took a firm stand against it and in every instance refused to approve one of these settlements for a single cent less than the law provided. The settlement in the Perry case was a glaring in - rnce of this practice. In July, 1919, an alleged settlement was made this case. The department refused to approve it. and then began a legal contest to have the settlement set aside. In October, 1920, the supreme court handed down its decision which sustained in every particular the contentions maintained by the department. We consider it the most important decision ever handed down by the Nebraska supreme court affecting the compensation law. The decision should be read by every employer and employe in the state. Nothing in connection with the administration of the compensa - tion law gave so much concern to the department during the first year of our work as the adjustment of doctor hills that were held to be excessive by insurance companies. Our first concern was to see that the Injured worker received the very best attention the medical profes - sion of the state could give. Second, we wanted the doctors' to be paid reasonable fee for their services, so there would be no danger of heapening the compensation law, and risking the injured worker being eglected because of mistaken niggardliness on the part of insurance companies. The Commissioner felt keenly his lack of experience in connection with the task of deciding for ar. insurance company whether r not the professional services of a physician to an injured worker fty or four hundred miles away was reasonable or unreasonable. The epartment, with the advice and assistance of the Department of Pub - ic Welfare prepared a medical fee schedule covering industrial acci - ents. This schedule was submitted to fifty physicians, surgeons and pecialists in various parts of the state for suggestions, be they either ncreases or reductions in the various items. From this was prepared a composite fee schedule that is being used as a basis' by the de - partment to adjust claims for professional services to the Injured workers who come under the compensation law. The doctors co - operated in a friendly and sympathetic manner with the department in preparing the fee schedule, and as a result the second year of the bien - nium the grief thin duty • entailed upon (he department was reduced to a minimum. t During the blennium the Commissioner heard 244 contested cases, was an increase of 171 over the number heard during the incum - :y of his predecessor. When these cases were heard in Lincoln or ha. It consumed a half day of the Commissioner's time. When they </seg>
            <seg id="p009">STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR 9 were heard out in the state It consumed the time of the Commissioner going and coming as well as a full day for the hearing. During the biennium there was a total of 24,949 accidents reported to the department. This was an increase of 4,590 over the number reported during the years 1917-1918. The following table shows the amount of compensation and medical expenses paid each year since the law was adopted by the slate: 1915 $ 51,167.3? 1916 116,958.34 1917 153.031.73 1918 141,777.47 1919 345,476.24 1920 540,213.08 The total amount paid to injured workers during the years 1919 and 1920 was $SS5,6SH.:^. which is $500,880.12 in excess of what was paid during 1917 and 1918. Further, it was $423,754.11 in excess of what was paid during the four years prior to 1919. There is but one penalty in the compensation law and that is fifty per cent of the amount of the compensation, which is applied when there is delay ir. the payment of compensation beyond the time speci- fied in the law when it should be paid. In the brief synopsis of the cases 1 heard by the Commissioner, which are printed in another part of this report, it will be noted the number of times the penalty was ap- plied.

            <seg id="p069">STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR 69 THE PERRY CASE The Compeusation Department of the state won its most important and tar-reaching case before the Supreme Court in October 1920. Briefly stated, the case is as follows: John E. Perry was injured on June 20, 1918, while employed by the Huffman Automobile Com - pany. The accident was reported to the department and compensa - tion waa paid for 12 weeks. Payments were then denied by the in - surance company for nine months. Then a petition was filed before the Compensation Commissioner for a hearing. Before a hearing was had Perry's attorney and the insurance company's adjuster agreed to settle the case for $500. Perry accepted the settlement, but when the final receipt was filed with the Compensation Department, ap - proval was denied. The Compensation Department then went before the district judge who approved the settlement and asked that it be set aside to allow the Compensation Commissioner to determine the disability as provided by law. When the case came before the judge there were four lawyers pres - ent including the injured man's attorney, to prevent the judge from setting aside the alleged settlement. The judge refused to set aside the settlement. Then the case was taken to Attorney A. H. Bigelow to fight out in the courts. The District Court refused to reconsider the case and it was appealed to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court decided against Mr. Bigelow, Mr. Perry and the Compensation Department. A motion was later made for a rehearing and granted. Then the Supreme Court handed down the following decision which sustained every point maintained by the Compensation Department: John E. Perry, Appellant, versus W. L. Huffman Automobile Co., Appellee. No. 21,298. 1.

Under the workmen's compensation act, in cases of death or permanent disability, commutation or payment in a lump sum by approved agreement is a departure from the general rule and should only be sanctioned upon the statutory terms relating to the exception. t5: Under the workmen's compensation act the nature and the nt of the injury are material inquiries upon an application for approval of an agreed commutation from periodical payments to lump sum for a permanent disability. 6. The authority to approve a commutation from periodical payments to the payment of a gross sum for a permanent disability has been committed by the workmen's compensation act to the district court but the settlement should be submitted to the com - pensation commissioner for his approval before the district court is asked to approve the commutation. liOSP This is a proceeding under the workmen's compensation act. laintiff fell from a ladder June 20. 1918. and broke two bones in his ft ankle, while performing the duties of a carpenter in the em - oy of defendant for $18.00 a week. The injury resulted in "a per - anent partial loss'' of the use of a foot within the meaning of the atute and plaintiff is entitled to compensation accordingly. Laws •17, ch. 85, sec. 7. Defendant paid and plaintiff received regular eekly payments of $12 for 12 weeks, amounting to $144. After ard the parties agreed to settle plaintiff's entire claims for the ump sum of $500. This settlement was presented to district court r Douglas county and it was approved July 10, 1919. Defendant as directed to pay plaintiff the unpaid balance of $356 in full satisfac - on of the latter's claim for compensation and that sum was so paid nd accepted. At the same term of court, August 30. 1919. plaintiff ed a motion to vacate the settlement on the grounds, among others, lat he did not receive the full compensation allowed by law, that be amount due him had not been determined by either the com - tensation commissioner or the district court and that the commuta - tion as approved was unauthorized. Upon a hearing of this motion n its merits It was overruled October 4, 1919. Plaintiff appealed.

            <seg id="p071">STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR 71 Did the district court err in overruling the motion to vacate the settlement? In approving the agreement did the trial court require the parties to comply with the statute under which both sought relief or protection? In entering into an agreement to discharge the employer from all liability for a permanent disability of the employee upon pay - ment of a lump sum in lieu of periodical payments, the parties' are not at liberty to make settlements at variance with statutory terms; aad ascertainment of the amounts of compensation payable periodically under the law. is a prerequisite to a contract for commutation. Laws 1917. ch. 85, sec. 16, amending sec. 3681. Rev. St. 1913. In the approval of a commutation of an employee's compensation from periodical payments to a payment in gross, the public has an interest which it iE the duty of the court to protect without regard to the wishes of the parties. The act creates new remedies and new liabilities. The manner in which it operates is found in the legislation itself. Its remedies, if invoked, interfere more or less with the freedom of contract and must be applied on the terms granted. The workmen's compensation act does not contemplate the pay - ment of large sums of money to improvident employees or de - pendents who may lose it and become a charge on the public. To prevent injured employees and dependents from squandering or losing their means of support, the legislature on grounds of public policy, has adopted the system of requiring employers to pay compensa tion for injuries in small periodical payments at short Interval* for a definite period. Commutation or payment in a lump sum by approved agreement of the parties is a departure from the general rule and should only bo sanctioned upon compliance with the statutory terms relating to the exception. Facts disclosing compliance with the provisions governing th" exception are subjects of inquiry on the hearing of »v«»ry application for the approval of a lump sum in lieu of periodical payment*. In the present case some of the facts essential to a compliance with the exception were not before the trial court when the settlement was approved. Evidence from which the nature and the extent of the injury couid be determined was wanting. The settlement had not bc-en presented to or approved by the compensation commissioner. Without accurate knowledge of the nature and the extent of the Injury the compensation to which plaintiff Is entitled is unknown and com - pensation based on the injury Is a material factor in the approval of an agreement for commutation. "The probable future payments, capi tallied at their present value upon the basis of interest calculated at live per centum per annum with annual rests," is the statutory method of determining the lump sum payable in lieu of periodical payments. Laws 1917, ch. 86. sec. 16. There Is no other stand ard for commutation. Any method reducing the compensation thus </seg>

The workmen's compensation act as amended in 1917 con - 8 the following provisions &gt; "The amounts of compensation payable periodically under the law, by agreement of the parties with the approval of the Compensation Commissioner, may be commuted to one or more lump sum payments, except compensation due for death and permanent disability, which may be commuted only upon the order or decision of the district court. Evided. that where commutation is agreed upon, or ordered by the rt, the lump sum to be paid shall be fixed at an amount which equal the total sum of the probable future payments capitalized at their present value upon the basis of interests calculated at five centum per annum with annual rests." Laws 1917, ch. 85, sec. 16. "All disputed claims for compensation or for benefits under this article must be submitted to the Compensation Commissioner." Laws 1917, ch. 85, sec. 13. "Reports of accidents and settlements 1 shall be made in form and manner as prescribed and directed by the Compensation Commissioner." Laws 1917, ch. 85, sec. 20. The compensation commissioner is charged with the duty of executing all provisions 1 of the act. Laws 1917, ch. 85, sec. 27. Every claim for benefits may be presented to the compensation commis - sioner for adjudication and award. Laws 1917, ch. 85, sec. 29. A copy of all settlements must be filed with the compensation commis - sioner. Laws 1917, ch. 85, sec. 127. While the authority to approve a lump sum for a permanent dis - ability has been committed to the district court, it seems to have been the intention of the legislature, as disclosed by the entire act, to require the parties to submit their agreement to the compensa - tion commissioner before asking the district court to approve the com - mutation. In the commutation of plaintiff's compensation, therefore, there was a failure to comply with the workmen's compensation act. The amounts of compensation payable periodically under the law had not been ascertained. The settlement had not been presented to the compensation commissioner for examination and approval. The nature and the extent of the Injury had not been shown. It fol - lows that there was 1 error in the overruling of the motion to vacate the judgment approving the settlement. In the further proceedings, however, defendant should be credited with the payments already made. The former opinion is modified to confirm to these views.

Also regulating the registration fee to be charged and the manner of conducting that business. The Labor Department was charged with the enforcement of this law. All agencies operating in the state were notified to comply with this law, furnished blanker, etc., with the result that the following firms applied, filed their bond and were granted a license to operate in the State: A.

            <seg id="p092">92 SEVENTEENTH BIENNIAL REPORT Proceedings were started against the Western Reference and Bond Association operated by Harry H. Knapp, as a test case. Com - plaint was filed July 21, 1919, before the police magistrate of Omaha. It was carried to the District Court and tried on stipulation, July M. 1920. Hon. Judge Troup of the District Court handed down a decision in which he held that the fundamentals of the law were valid, but that inasmuch as the action was brought for the purpose of testing the law, rather than to punish an offender, dismissed the defendant. Following is a synopsis of the findings of the court "Legislatures have a right to exercise police power in the regula - tion of business concerns' where there might be a question of honesty in dealing with the public, and as employment agencies are not always old and established concerns it is only proper that some legislation should exist that would protect the rights of those that have made the business a legitimate one. "Sections 1 and 2, Valid. "Section 3. Do not think that part of Section 3 is good whereby the Department of Labor has a right to bring an action on a bond in the name of the State of Nebraska, but will, however, not hold that, section invalid, but if such action is brought that question will undoubtedly be determined by the trial judge. "Section 4. A little broad, but held to be valid. "Section 8. That part of Section 8 which provides that the record of references' shall be opened to the inspection and examination of applicant is a breach of confidence, and not good law, is declared invalid; and in the second paragraph that part which reads, "but the further fee aforesaid shall nbt be received by such licensee before the applicant has been tendered a position by said licensed person" down to the words, 'made therefor' is invalid; also the last two paragraphs of that section held invalid." t Penalty clauses must not apply to parts of law declared invalid, bond must be so worded that no action against bond can be ght for non compliance with parts of law declared invalid. kThis department, on the advise of the County Attorney, filed com - nts against five other violators of the law, Harry Knapp, William Freeland. Frank Christman, W. C. Martin and J. T. Sweeney, se cases are now pending in the District Court of Douglas County. ACTIVITIES OF OMAHA BRANCH Shortly after the appointment of the present incumbent as head of the Department of Labor, he realized that to properly administer the provisions of the Workmen's Compensation Law would not only require the entire time of himself and an assistant in the main office at Lincoln, but also that the scope of the work In Omaha must be materially increased. </seg>
            <seg id="p093">STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR 93 It is true that for some time prior to 1918 the Department had a desk in the U. S. Employment office then in the Douglas County court house. Victims of industrial accidents might there get infor - mation concerning compensation to which they were entitled. How - ever, no organized effort had ever been made to disseminate this infor - mation, and the beneficent provisions of the law were known to but comparatively few people. The governor was then appealed to for a solution of the problem, and he suggested that inasmuch as a large percentage of Nebraska's industrial accidents occur in Omaha, the logical thing to do woulu be to establish a branch office there which would render practically the same service as did the Lincoln office. This suggestion was followed, and such an office was opened, with an investigator and a clerk con - stantly in attendance. One of the most important activities of this office has been, and yet is, to acquaint the great army of employes — as well as their employers — with the fact that the office is maintained for their con - venience. This was no small task. Two years ago fully 90 per cent of our citizens were unaware of even the existence of a Workmen's Compensation Law, or at best, had but a hazy idea of its aims and purposes. To further this work communications were addressed to all the la - bor organizations asking their co-operation; thousands of copies of the law were mailed or personally delivered; tens of thousands of cards bearing instructions to injured employes were distributed in places where men and women work, as well as in places where workingmen and working women congregate during hours of rest and recreation; the aid of churches, labor organizations, lodges, clubs, and the press was sought, and the commissioner addressed various organizations at every opportunity during the biennium. While this work is far from complete, it is indeed gratifying to know that today a greater knowledge of the law's provisions and benefits exists throughout the industrial plants of the city. The volume of business passing through this office is constantly increas - ing, due primarily to the spreading of this propaganda. The office affords 100 per cent service to the injured worker. His case is quickly and thoroughly investigated; his 1 interests are carefully looked after, and every possible effort made to adjust his claim, if he has a legitimate one, in accord with the strict letter of the law; should he need medical attention, it is speedily provided him; and finally, if there is a dispute between injured employe and employer and it becomes necessary that his rights should be protected, then he may file a petition for a formal hearing before the commis - sioner. This office fills out such petition for him, forwards it to Lin - coln for filing and docketing, serves the summons and copy upon his employer, and follows his claim through, until the jurisdiction of </seg>

All this service is absolutely without t, and is furnished gladly to those who will but apply for It. t Since its establishment the office has received fully 500 conipen - ion cases for investigation which otherwise would have hart to go Lincoln direct, and the investigation conducted largely by mail. Aside from the efforts of the investigator to compel the various labor agencies in Omaha to take out state licenses, as the law di - rects, there were twenty-four complaints of violations of the laws gov - erning these institutions received, investigated, and adjudicated. Sixty-eight wage disputes were investigated and either satisfactorily adjusted or referred to the public defender for prosecution. tin the health and safety division there were but nine complaints i. These were promptly investigated and the defects complained remedied. In the female and child labor suction there were fifty-nine viola - tions reported, which were all investigated. In first offenses the vio - ators were cautioned that a second offense would mean arrest. Sev - eral arrests were made, convictions had, and fines assessed. Some I these fines were paid while others 1 were appealed to the district court, where they still hang fire. One decision handed down by ollce Judge Foster declared the Female Labor Law unconstitutional. n the grounds that it was class legislation and applied only to certain specified parts of the state. Another case for violation of the emale Labor Law in a newspaper office a conviction was obtained in police court, the case was appealed to the district court and the appeal ustained by the trial judge deciding that a newspaper establishment was neither an office nor a manufacturing establishment. This case s now in the supreme court. The city has been exceptionally free from labor troubles during the past two years, there being but three or four cases that even approached a serious condition. The most serious was a strike of the teamsters in 1919, involving some 1,200 men. Of lesser magnitude and importance was a strike of the meat cutters in April, 1920, and, a month or two later, of the painters. </seg>
