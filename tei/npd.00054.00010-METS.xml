            <seg id="p011">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 11 CASES BEFORE THE INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION Corn Rate*. Under date of September 10, 1924. the Commission filed a formal complaint with the Interstate Commerce Commission (I. C. C. Docket 16322) relative to the adjustment of rates on corn from statlous In Nebraska within a radius of about one hundred miles from Superior, when moving through Superior to points in Kansas and Oklahoma, located on the rails of the A. T. ft S. F. Ry. Co. and the Missouri Pacific R. R. Co. In this complaint the Commission alleged that there is a large quantity of corn moved in carload lots from point.} in Nebraska to points in Kansas and Oklahoma located on the A. T. &amp; S. F. Ry. Co. and the M. P. R. R. Co.; that the C. B. ft Q. R. R. Co.. C. ft N. W. Ry. Co., and M. P. R. R. Co. do not now maintain joint through rates via Superior from points in Nebraska to stations in Kansas and Oklahoma and that the present rates are the sum of the locals from points of origin in Nebraska to Superior and from Superior to final destination. In this case it will be the purpose of the Commission to prove that there is a substantial movement of corn into territory involved and that our shippers are entitled to a just rate comparable with traffic moving in other directions. This complaint was filed to take care of a complaint filed with this Com - mission by Mr. J. W. Shorthill. Secretary of the Nebraska Farmers Cooperative Grain and Live Stock State Association relative to th« rates from Lawrence to points in Kansas via the Missouri Pacific as compared with the rates from Lawrence to the same points in Kansas moving out of Lawrence over the rails of the C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co. From the number of parties that have intervened in this case, it is quite apparent that the case is going to be of great importance to our shippers when moving corn from points in Nebraska through Superior. The case has been set for hearing at Lincoln on March 2. 1925. Grain Rates. Under date of October 17, 1924, the Commission filed a petition with the Interstate Commerce Commission protesting against the cancellation of certain portions of transcontinental tariff 1-W in which the A. T. &amp; S. F. Ry. Co. proposed to cancel the present rates on carload shipments of transit grain, and grain products from points in eastern Nebraska to points in Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, Nevade and California. In that petition the Commission took the position that the cancellation of the rates was not warranted by transportation conditions and that Nebraska points would! be adversely affected by the proposed increases shown. On October 22, 1924, the Interstate Commerce Commission acknowledged receipt of our protest requesting the suspension of the proposed changes and </seg>
            <seg id="p012">12 SEVENTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT advised that the Commission had voted not to suspend the supple - ments in this issue but that the action of the Commission did not approve any of the schedules contained in the protested tariffs and nasmuch as we have had no further complaint from our shippers, he matter was not presented to the Interstate Commerce Commission on the formal docket. Grain Rates, Effective October 1, 1924, the A. T. &amp; S. F. Ry. Co. filed supple - ment 23 to its grain tariff 5588-M. This supplement was published out for the purpose of cancelling joint rates on grain from eastern Nebraska stations originating on the C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co., and destined o stations in Kansas located on the A. T. &amp; S. F. Ry. Co. These joint rates have been in effect for a number of years and were being used &gt;y our shippers, and the effect of this supplement would have been o materially increase the rates on grain from the above mentioned erritory. On September 10, this Commission filed a petition with :he Interstate Commerce Commission requesting that body to suspend supplement 23 to 5588-M and that after full and complete tearing and investigation, the proposed changes in the rates be permanently suspended. On September 29, 1924, the Interstate Commerce Commission advised us that the A. T. &amp; S. F. Ry. Co. had made application to them under Sixth Section authority, to restore on three days notice, the old rates existing prior to the cancellation .8 set forth in supplement 23. This authority was granted by the nterstate Commerce Commission and as a matter of fact, the supple - ment cancelling the Joint rates never became effective. This is an - other instance where quick action on the part of this Commission, saved our shippers a considerable amount without a prolonged itigation. The Western Grain Kate Case There was pending at the time our last report was issued, « ase involving all grain rates between Nebraska stations and inter - tate markets as a part of a general proceeding before the Interstate Commerce Commission known as Docket 14393. This case was sub - mitted to the Interstate Commerce Commission in the early part of 923 and a decision was handed down under date of October 11, 1923, n which the Commission found that the general basis of rates on grain, grain products and hay within the western group, had not been hown upon the present record to be unjust or unreasonable ar.d hey permitted the case to be reopened in order to secure the develop - ment of a more complete record. Additional proceedings were hnd under I. C. 0. Docket 15263 which docket embraced 1439C. The matter was submitted to the Commission under date of March 22. 924, and that body, under date of July 10th, handed down their </seg>
            <seg id="p013">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 13 decision in which they dismissed the proceedings in Docket 14393 and discontinued the proceedings in 15263. The result of these two decisions was to leave the grain, grain products and hay ratea the same as they were before we intervened in Docket 14393. Combination Role. After a large number of shippers had complained to this Com - mission relative to the proposed cancellation of the combination rule applicable on shipments of sand, stone, etc., the Commission under date of December 15, 1923, communicated with Mr. G. B. McGinty, Secretary of the Interstate Commerce Commission, at Washington D. C. requesting suspension of the supplements that made the can - cellation of the combination rule. This matter was handled under I. C. C. Docket I. &amp; S. No. 1987 and under date of December 19, 1923, the Interstate Commerce Commission suspended the tariffs and supplements carrying the cancellation of the combination rule. Later under date of January 15, 1924, the Interstate Commerce Commission, in view of the fact that the carriers had reinstated the combination rule, set aside and dismissed the proceedings in the above men - tioned docket. The Live Stock Case As mentioned in our previous report, the Interstate Commerce Commission under Docket 13273, instituted an investigation as to the lawfulness and propriety of all rates applicable on common live stock from points in Nebraska to the Missouri river markets. After numerous conferences between members of this Commission and members of the Interstate Commerce Commission, a decision was finally reached in which rates on common live stock from all Ne - braska stations to Missouri river cities were prescribed. This decision while it increased some rates, materially reduced rates on live stock moving from points on the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad north and west of Aurora. The net effect of this adjustment of ratea was to place all the shippers on an equal basis, distances together with competitive features considered, when moving stock from interior points to the Missouri river jobbing points. Class and Commodity Rates Under date of August 15, 1924, the Omaha Chamber of Commerce filed a complaint with the Interstate Commerce Commission (I. C. C. Docket 16226) attacking the class and commodity rates from points east of the Illinois-Indiana state line and north of the Ohio and Potomac to Omaha. This complaint involves the entire class and commodity rate adjustment from points in that territory to Omaha. The Nebraska Commission, after due consideration, felt that in order </seg>
            <seg id="p014">14 SEVENTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT t protect the interests of the people of the state of Nebraska, they uld intervene and under date of October 24 this Commission filed petition of intervention in the above mentioned case requesting hat they be advised of hearings, that they have the right of notice, hat they be permitted to produce and cross-examine witnesses and lie briefs and be heard in oral argument. From the correspondence on file It is apparent that the Interstate Commerce Commission has allowed the Boston Chamber of Commerce, New England Traffic League. Buffalo Chamber of Commerce and many other interests to ntervene in this case and from this it would indicate that there is to be quite an array of witnesses and exhibits presented. It might be well to tate that this case was set down for hearing October 31 at Omaha ut later was postponed and another date has not as yet been set When the matter comes up for general hearing this Commission will take an active part and will submit exhibitg to prove that Nebraska shippers are entitled to as low a rate as other shippers in other territories. In our previous report we mentioned the fact that there was tending before the Interstate Commerce Commission, a case involving he propriety and lawfulness of interstate and intrastate class rates &gt;etween jobbing and non-jobbing points in the state of Nebraska, n this case it was proposed to enter into a series of investigations o determine a reasonable level of rates for application to and from he jobbing points In Nebraska as compared with the class rated applicable between all stations in Nebraska. At the same time an investigation was to be made regarding the propriety of sub - stituting Western Classification No. 58 in lieu of Nebraska Classification No. 1. Hearings were held with regard to the adoption of Western Classification and the Nebraska Commission expects to hand down a decision on this portion, in the early part of 19 25. A* yet, the matter of the class rate adjustment has not been set down for hearing. Sugar Case Upon complaint from The Donald Company and others of Grand Island and Hastings, relative to the adjustment of rates on sugar from 'New Orleans to Grand Island, the Commission derided that it would be proper to bring a formal complaint before the Interstate Commerce Commission on sugar, carload, when moving from New Orleans to various points in the state of Nebraska and under date of September 17, 1924, the Commission filed a formal complaint with the Interstate Commerce Commission (I. C. C. Docket 16341) alleging that the rates on sugar from New Orleans to points in Nebraska west of Lincoln were unjustly discriminatory and unlawful and asking the Commission to prescribe just and reasonable rates for the future. A number of organizations and shippers have intervened in this case </seg>
            <seg id="p015">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 15 and it promises to be quite a case before It is finished. The Com - mission will introduce a large number of exhibits in this case to show that the rates on sugar from New Orleans to Superior, Hastings, Grand Island, Norfolk, Columbus and other points, are unduly high, unjust and unreasonable. The date of the hearing has been set by the Interstate Commerce Commission for March 3rd at Lincoln. Coal Rates In our previous report we mentioned the general investigation to be made by the Interstate Commerce Commission in what was known as the Western Coal Rates Case, under Docket 14855. A tentative report was submitted by the examiner in which he proposed that the rates from Rock Springs district to points on the Union Pacific should be a certain amount in cents over the Walsenburg district. In other words, the examiner proposed a minimum scale which, if it becomes effective, will prevent the Union Pacific Railroad company from establishing rates from Rock Springs to points in Ne - braska on an equal competitive basis with the rates from Colorado. The Nebraska Commission filed exceptions to this report taking the position that in view of the fact that the Wyoming mines have supplied tin- major portion of the coal used at many central and western Ne - braska stations, that the result of the adoption of the examiners report would be to reverse this condition and would give the Colorado mines a chance to enter into this territory on a somewhat less rate than from the Wyoming districts and would at the same time increase the rates from the Wyoming districts. The Nebraska Commission also took the position that the carriers serving Nebraska stations from the Wyoming mines located on the Union Pacific and Burlington should be left free to adjust their rates as the transportation condi - tions would allow, after the proposed rates from Colorado territory were established. The final decision of the Commission in these proceedings has n«t yet been handed down. The Illinois Coal Traffic Bureau under date of April 3, 1924 filed a complaint with the Interstate Commerce Commission attacking the rates on steam coal from points in Illinois to various territories, alleging that the rates on steam coal were unjust and unreasonable and asked that the Interstate Commission set down for investigation the matter of rates to be assessed on carload shipments of steam coal from points in Illinois to interstate destinations. The complaint in this case is very wide-spread and will probably involve the adjustment of rates and descriptions from all bituminus producing fields to Ne - braska stations. According to the complaint, some of the carriers do not now publish a lower rate on steam coal than on lump coal. In consideration of the fact that Nebraska receives coal from various territories, the Commission felt that they should intervene in this </seg>
            <seg id="p016">16 case and, therefore, under date of July 11, 1924, we filed a petition of intervention. This case was set down for hearing September 25. 1924, at Chicago but later was postponed and the files now indicate that this complaint has been cancelled out entirely, the complainants having requested permission to withdraw their complaint. On May 31, 1924, we received a letter from the Grand Island Chamber of Commerce and later a communication from the T. B. Hord Grain Company asking us to Intervene in a petition that they lad filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission under date of fay 23 asking for the suspension of increased coal rates that the arriers had published out to become effective June 5. Under date of June 3 we wrote the Interstate Commerce Commission advising hat in view of the protest received, we desired to enter a protest gainst the rates sought to be established by the carriers on carload hipments of slack coal from Kansas and Missouri mines to points in Nebraska. This petition was docketed under I. &amp; S. 2142. Before he matter could be set down for hearing the carriers, in a letter ated June 19, 1H24, advised the Interstate Commerce Commission hat they were agreeable to restoring the rates that were in effect June , except that the I". P. R. H. Co. had decided not to carry coal on the ower basis of rates to Grand Island and on account of Fourth Sec - ion departures that road felt that they should not participate in the movement but that the St. J. &amp; G. I. Ry. should carry coal into Grand sland. With this action on the part of the carriers, there apparently was no need for a formal hearing and under date of June 23 we wrote the Interstate Commerce Commission advising them that we were agreeable to the restoration of the old rates and in view of the act that the petition was taken care of informally the matter never ame on for a formal hearing. The Grand Island Chamber of Com - merce and the T. B. Hord Grain Co. wrote the Commission thanking lem for their hearty cooperation in securing the proper disposition f this complaint. • LITIGATION SUMMARY tCases in which the Commission is concerned in which final ers have been issued, or which are pending in various courts, are follows: United States District Court kB.

That lots of time we load out five, six and loads of livestock. "That we shipped in 1922, from Raeville, 127 carloads livestock in and out. That in 1923 up to date we shipped rs of livestock. That we have no water, shelter nor scales. "That we have shipped out of the village of Raeville from one store alone 737 cases of eggs, 1111 cans of cream and 87 coops of poultry in 1922. And in 1923 up to date we shipped 262 cases of eggs, 223 cans of cream, and IS coops of poultry. "That the store has paid for freight and express in 1922, 11710.27, and in 1923 to date we have paid |410.74. "W« also call the Honorable Commissioners' attention to the fact that there is no depot at Raeville. "That during 1922, we shipped ninety cars of grain out. </seg>
            <seg id="p140">140 That we received merchandise in carload lots, IS cars of sand, lime, cement and oil stuffs, 5 emigrant cars in.

"That in 1923 to date we have shipped 14 cars of grain, 8 carloads of lumber and materials in. And 6 carloads of hay in. Two cars of emigrants out and 1 car of hay out. "That we are greatly handicapped because we have no stor - age room for poultry and that it is shipped out about 6:40 in the morning on the express train. "We respectfully protest that we should have suitable stock - yards and a depot for the village ot Raeville, Nebraska." The case was set down for hearing by the Commission at Haeville on August 14, 1923, at 10:00 o'clock a. m., which hearing was held by Commissioners Browne and Randall for the Commission. The Chicago &amp; North Western Railway company was represented by Wymer Dress - ier, counsel, C. T. Boone, division superintendent, and C. H. Reynolds, assistant general superintendent. Several witnesses for the complainants testified as to the necessity for a depot, with an agent, and other facilities at that point, and pro - duced testimony to show that the business at Raeville had grown to such an extent that, in their judgment, they were entitled to a depot, agent and other facilities for the taking care of the business at that point. The conditions at Raeville, as found by the Commission from the testimony and personal investigation, are as follows: In 1916 there were a Catholic church, parochial school, store, and postoffice located about one-half mile east of the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway company's right-of-way, approximately four miles northwest of the town of Petersburg and eight miles south of the town of Elgin. There were some half dozen residences tributary to the church and school, and the church desired to build an extensive brick church and school building and for the accommodation of this construction the railway company built a switch for the handling of this building material. The switch, however, was constructed in a very substantial manner. After the contemplated buildings were completed a large double brick store, a brick bank, and a large double brick garage were con - structed. The Crowell Lumber &amp; Cram company built a substantial elevator, lumber yard and sheds. The railway company erected two stock shipping pens, with a chute, on an order of this Commission. The town has now grown to such a proportion that they have twenty - six substantial residences, with a population of one hundred. The rail - way company placed a box car by the side of the track, to be used by the public as a storeroom, or a depot, for L. C. L. freight, express, etc. </seg>
            <seg id="p141">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 141 A caretaker is employed by the railway company to look after the business of the company at that point. All cars for the shipment of livestock and grain are ordered by telephone, either from the agent at Petersburg, or from the agent at Elgin, and all billing la done at one or the other of these two stations, depending upon the direction of the movement of the freight. Passengers have been required to pay their fares on the train, there being no ticket agent at that point. The railway business credited to the town has grown to a volume of over $25,000 a year. The lay of the country surrounding the towns of Raerille and Peters - burg is quite hilly, which makes the convenience of a short-haul to Raeville of considerable advantage to the shippers of all commodities living adjacent thereto over the necessity of hauling the distance between that point and Petersburg, or Elgin. The country is well improved and thickly settled. The testimony of the witnesses and the record In the Commis - sion's office, furnished by the company, show that during the year 1923 there were 69 cars of corn, 25 cars of grain products, and 117 cars of livestock shipped from Raeville. Over 30,000 pounds of L. C. L. ship - ments were shipped from this point. There were 24 carloads of freight received, and 252,800 pounds of L. C. L. freight received at that station during that same year. These amounts do not include express ship - ments, which were shown to be quite extensive In the way of cream, poultry, and eggs. The stockyards facilities at this point were shown to be very inadequate for the handling of the volume of business, there being only two yards, no water facilities, and no shelter for stock. The two pens that are being used are only thirty-two feet square. The railway company raised no serious objection to increasing the capacity of the stockyards and the furnishing of adequate water supply and providing two of the shipping pens with sheds, but it did seriously object to the erection of a depot and the furnishing of an agent at that point. The objection of the railway company to maintaining an agent at that point was the expense that they claimed was unnecessary, owing to the fact that the billing of cars, and other work that would be re - quired of an agent, could be done at Petersburg and Elgin, which the Commission finds is a fact. As the company now maintains a caretaker the only expense the company would be to, over the present expense, which is very nominal, would be the building of a suitable building for a waiting room and for the storage of freight and express, and the heating and lighting of the waiting room. From the testimony introduced at the hearing, and from the re - ports that have been filed from time to time with the Commission, and </seg>
            <seg id="p142">142 tie amount of business that is being transacted at that point, and the ize of the town and the character of the improvements that have been made, the Commission finds that the facilities furnished by the Chicago i North Western Railway company, for the use of the public and the itizens of the town of Raeville, are inadequate and should be increased n the following manner: 1. The stockyards capacity should be doubled. That would re - quire the building of two additional yards, each thirty-two feet square, with an alleyway between the present yards, of not less than twelve eet, ieading to the loading chute, as shown by blue print N 4 72 filed by the railway company with the Commission. Two of the shipping pens should be provided with shelter the full length of one side of each yard, and a well and windmill with storage capacity to furnish adequate water supply for the stock shipped from that point. 2. The present box car should be removed and a suitable build - up built large enough to provide a convenient and comfortable wait- Dg room of a capacity sufficient to accommodate not less than fifteen people. The waiting room should be provided with a stove, so that the uihiing can be warmed during weather when heat is necessary for he comfort of the public, and with adequate lighting facilities to be used at the time trains arrive before daylight or after sundown.

Appearances: For complainant, Walter V. Hoagland, attorney. For defendant, Jesse L. Root, attorney. For the Commission, Hugh LaMaster, assistant attorney general. RANDALL, Commissioner Plaintiff herein alleges that he is a resident of Lincoln county, Nebraska, and is the owner of certain lands which are crossed by the railroad track owned and operated by defendant company, and that he does not now have an adequate and safe means of crossing said track. Plaintiff further represents that he is a resident on said land, and that an under-grade crossing is necessary to satisfy -his require - ments and eliminate the hazard of crossing the track at grade. A hearing on the matter was held by the Commission at its offices in Lincoln, August 31, 1923. The record shows that plaintiff is the owner of land described as follows: All of section five (5), township nine (9) north, range thirty (30) west Sixth P. M., with the exception of the southwest quarter (SW&gt;4) of the southwest quarter (SW^i) of said section, and is the owner of the north one-half (NH) of section six (6) of the same town and range, with the exception of the west one-half (WV4) of the northwest quarter (NW',1 of said section. He also owns the northwest quarter (NW% ) of the southeast quarter (SE%) and the northeast quarter (NE',i) of the southwest quarter (SW%) of section six (6) in Lincoln county, Nebraska. Petitioner owns about 920 acres of land, approximately two-thirds of which lies north and east of the track and the remainder is on the south and west side. Defendant's railroad track crosses the south half of section five. It enters this section from the south about three-eights of a mile west of the southeast corner, and extends in a northwesterly direction to a point near the northeast corner of the northwest quarter of the southwest quarter of the section, where it turns west and extends as far as the center of section six, where it turns northwest and crosses the northwest quarter of this section. Plaintiff's residence and farm buildings are located south and west of the railroad near the northeast corner of the southeast quarter of the southwest quarter of section five. He also has an artificial </seg>

There is no road to the west or south and it is necessary for plaintiff to cross the track to go to his home from the north or east. Respond - ent has provided a grade crossing for use of plaintiff, which Is located southeast of his buildings. The land north of the railroad is used for grazing and agricultural purposes. As conditions are now, it Is neces - sary to drive stock from the land north of the track to the east and south by way of the grade crossing to the lake for water. It Is also necessary to use the grade crossing for farm vehicles in con - ducting agricultural operations. The railroad right of way at the crossing is not more than eighty feet wide. It is fenced on both sides and equipped with gates which must be opened and closed when the crossing is used. The company maintained cattle guards at the cross - ing for a number of years when It was open, but these were removed and the gates erected. This change was described as a serious ob - stacle to its use in crossing with vehicles, and in particular with stock. However, if an undergrade crossing is provided for the animals, much of the hazard will be removed. Plaintiff has asked for an opening under the track large enough to permit farm vehicles to pass. When these are taken across the track at grade, they are personally con - ducted and it is possible to exercise caution, while droves of cattle cannot be handled in this manner. The traffic on the railroad consists of a passenger train each way every day except Sundays and one freight train each alternate day of the week, Sundays excepted. Extra trains on this branch are rarely used. It was admitted that there is a suitable location for a grade cross - ing north of and near plaintiff's buildings and lake. If this should be provided, stock grazing on the land north of the track could pass freely back and forth to water and eliminate the hazard and inconvenience of the use of the crossing at grade. Respondent submitted the estimated cost of four concrete struc - tures which might be placed in the location described above, for plain - tiff's convenience. They are set out below: The large concrete structures, which will permit the use of farm vehicles in crossing under the track are more expensive than the cir - cumstances appear to justify. The rectangular concrete stock pass, with a cross section of 6 by 7 feet will cost more money and does not offer many advantages which are not secured by the 72 inch pipe. Concrete Subway, Cross Section 16 by 13 feet $13,098.00 Concrete Subway, Cross Section 14 by 12 feet 12,431.00 Concrete Stock Pass, 6 by 7 feet 2,552.00 Concrete Pipe Stock Pass, 72-inch diameter 1,398.00 </seg>

The testimony shows that tual construction costs may be somewhat lower than these estimates. The Commission finds that plaintiff is the owner of the land on &gt;oth sides of defendant's railroad track as set out in plaintiff's petition, and that the present crossing facilities provided for said plaintiff are nadequate for his purposes. The Commission further finds that the eventy-two inch concrete pipi\ properly constructed under the de - endant's track to the north of plaintiff's house and farm buildings at M. P. 90.65 will be adequate for the purposes of the plaintiff, and the Commission further finds that the estimated cost of same in the amount of J1.39S.0O is reasonable for the proposed construction, and hat the plaintiff's share of this cost shall not exceed $349.00 or one - lalf of the difference between the total cost of the proposed construc - lon and $700.00, as provided by statute. The Commission further finds that the plaintiff shall deposit the sum of $349.00 with the assist - ant treasurer of the railroad company at Omaha on or before April 1, 1924, or this order shall be null and voi OKDKK IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebrask K Commission that the Chicago, Burlington &lt;Sc Quincy R shall place a seventy-two inch concrete pipe under its r Ear the northeast corner of the southeast quarter of the south arter of section five, township !», north range 3o west, other scribed as M.

McPherson, a resi- Johnson county, Nebraska, running against the Chicago, ngton &amp; Quincy Railroad company on account of a dangerous juate crossing over the railroad track owned and operated by defendant and located where the railroad crosses the section line between sections 18 and 19, township 4, north, range 9 east, 6th 1". M. The plaintiff was joined in this complaint by the county com - missioners of Johnson county by resolution which describes the situa - tion complained of and was filed with the Commission and made a part of this complaint. A hearing was held and testimony taken at Crab Orchard, Nebraska, September 2S, 1923. The Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad company owns and operates a line extending in an easterly direction from Beatrice via Filley and Crab Orchard to Tecumseh, Auburn and beyond. In the vicinity of the crossing complained of the railroad extends in a north - easterly and southwesterly direction and intersects the east and west Attest: John E. Curtiss, Secretary. (SEAL) </seg>
            <seg id="p148">148 SEVENTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT section line between sections IS and 19, which are ajacent to the west boundry line of Johnson county, about six hundred feet from the county line. The section line is a public highway and is used by the residents near the crossing in traveling east and west between Fllley, Crab Orchard and points beyond. The east and west highway on either side of the railroad crossing is in fair serviceable condition within a short distance of the railroad right of way. The slope of the country is from the west and south to the north and east and a natural drainage line parallels the rail - road near the east side of the track where the natural ground is low as compared with the country immediately to the east and west. The railroad approaches the highway from the south in a long deep cut which terminates about two hundred feet south of the section line. From this point across the section line and beyond for some distance the track is on an embankment which is approximately eighteen or twenty feet above the natural surface of the ground. Approaching the crossing from the west the present highway turns south near the railroad and extends for a distance of about 160 feet, where It crosses the track at grade at the north end of the cut, then the highway turns north and ascends abruptly as it ap - proaches the original course of the highway on the section line. A view of the track to the left und north is clear, but the view to the south is obscured by the banks of the cut and a view of the truck to the south cannot be had until the traveler is close to the rails Approaching the crossing from the east the highway turns to the left and south near the railroad right of way and rises sharply to the crossing by a winding road. The view of the track to the north is clear but the view to the south is obscured by the east bank of the cut until the traveler is practically on the crossing. The view on this side is especially bad because the approach is much lower than the railroad grade. There are three trains which pass this point each day except Sunday during the daylight hours. The record does not disclose any serious accidents as the volume of travel over the crossing under existing conditions is small, but this should not be taken as a meas - ure of the local requirements in view of the objectionable features. There is a parallel graded highway one mile to the north, but there is no outlet to this road for some distance to the east except this crossing. There is also a parallel highway to the south but it is out of the line of travel. There is practically no conflict in the testimony as to the physical conditions at the crossing. The curves in the highway on both sides of the track, the long cut to the south which obscures the view and the </seg>
            <seg id="p149">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 149 teep grade of the approach on the east side create a situation which. Mould be corrected and the question here is which remedy should applied The railroad company contended that the approach on the east side of the track should be lengthened whereby the grade iiii^ht be leduced aud the company offered to pay for the necessary grading on the railroad right of way. If this plan is adopted it would also be necessary for the county to bear the expense of the grading beyond the boundries of the roadway. This would not change the situation on the west side of the track and eliminate the hazard of crossing the track at grade near the cut. Moreover, the approaches would be n curves which should be avoided under these conditions if possible. I'lulntiffs maintained that an undergrade crossing would be the logical solution of the problem under existing conditions. This would afford a straight highway under the track and eliminate the hazards referred to. The railroad embankment is high enough to permit the required clearance of thirteen feet under the track. The railroad company showed that a timber bridge consisting of four fourteen feet spans on wood piles with one twenty foot steel I-beam on woodea piles would be necessary to permit an undergrade crossing at this location. The twenty foot span would be over the proposed roadway and this would cost approximately $5,914. Included in this sum la approximately $1000 for grading below the stringers. The Commission does not feel that the entire burden of correct - ing this situation should fall upon the railroad as the duty of the public to construct and maintain its highways Is well established. The equities of the situation suggest that the county should join with the railroad in the expense of the improvements necessary to protect travelers on the public highway. In any event, the condition should be improved and the grading required by the county in the event that the dirt approaches are maintained might well be done in re - moving the dirt under the railroad bridge and preparing the crossing for permanent and safe use by the traveling public. The Commission believes and so finds that the crossing complained of is dangerous and inadequate and that au undergrade crossing under defendant's track on the section line is required for the protection and necessity of the public, whether passengers on the railroad or travelers on the public way and a conditional order will be entered which will provide that the defendant shall erect a structure over the county line in accordance with the estimate submitted by the company made a part of the record in this case, which will afford an opportunity for an undergrade crossing on the highway, provided that the county shall perform all the excavation necessary, both on the </seg>

The prayer asks for an order requiring the defendant railroads to install such connect- ing track In its answer the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad company admits that while it is a common carrier by rail of passengers and freight in Nebraska, it is not subject to any of the statutes of the state of Nebraska concerning Interchange tracks; that practically all of the grain shipped from its stations, or over its lines of railway in the state of Nebraska, is shipped Interstate; that the Transportation </seg>

The wer of the Chicago &amp; North Western is a general denial. The facts as developed by the testimony and evidence are sub - tantially as follows: There are three grain elevators in Harvard, lat operated by plaintiff with a capacity of approximately 20,000 ushels; that of the Seifken Grain Company with a capacity of 80,000 lushels being located on the tracks of the North Western; while te elevator of the Nebraska-Iowa Grain company, with a capacity f 60,000 bushels, is located on the tracks of the Burlington. Com - tainant has coal sheds on both railroads. Harvard is located in the enter of a very productive agricultural territory and reaches out for radius of some nine or ten miles. W. H. Smith, who owns the our mill, and also is mayor of the city, stated that he sells most of its flour locally but ships some to Chicago, Kansas City and St. ,ouis. He believes he could ship coal from the west at a saving of fty cents per ton if a connecting track were installed. He has the ame rate to Kansas City as is in effect on the Burlington. When he lips flour locally to any Burlington point he hauls to the team racks of that road. The principal testimony for complainant was ubmitted by Fred C. Hoffman, manager of the Farmers Union levator company. He states that for the past two or three years most of the grain purchased by his firm has been shipped to Kansas lty and that the market at that point is superior to the market in maha. On track bids buyers prefer Burlington billing. The demand or such billing is sufficient to justify increased offers of 1 % cents per bushel on corn and from two to three cents per bushel on wheat. n support of this contention a letter from a Hastings grain company was submitted in which it was stated that Burlington billing was referable and that North Western billing could not be accepted zcept for one cent per bushel discount. Until July, of last year the ate to Kansas City via the North Western was greater than the rate o the same point via the Burlington. At the present time, however, le rates are the same. It was also disclosed through the testimony f the Commission's rate expert, Mr. Little, that the rate from larvard to the Gulf on export grain is the same via either line. It was developed that the advantage in Burlington billing might possibly esult from there being more mills on that line in Kansas uud Missouri, hus offering a somewhat wider market. This, however, was not eflnitely shown. Mr. Hoffman admits that bis concern buys the ulk of the grain at Harvard but insists that it in handled under a landicap of from one cent to three cents per bushel M compared o his competitor on the Burlington. While it is apparent that complainant is perfectly sincere in his belief that thla handicap exists, it Beems probable that th« </seg>
            <seg id="p153">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 153 advantage of the Burlington billing lies more in assertion than in substantial fact. For example, in 1922, according to the records in the offices of the Commission, which were made a part of the records in this case, there were shipped on the North Western thirty-three cars of wheat and thirty-seven cars of corn lntrastate and thirty-nine cars of wheat and thirty-two cars of corn interstate. Whereas on the Burlington fifty-three cars of wheat and twenty-three cars of corn were shipped intrastate and only five cars of wheat and twenty-six cars of corn interstate. In 1921 there were shipped on the North Western thirty - four cars of wheat and fifteen cars of corn intrastate and thirty-nine cut of wheat and seventeen cars of corn interstate. On the Burling - ton let the same year eighty-seven cars of wheat and twenty-one cars of corn were shipped intrastate and only three cars of wheat and fourteen cars of corn were shipped interstate. This clearly and definitely discloses that the influence of Burlington billing is more imaginary than actual. It the elevator on Burlington tracks has the lvamage claimed a very substantial majority of his shipments would he made interstate, either to Kansas City, or Kansas and Colorado points. We find, however, that in 1922, out of a total of 107 cars shipped, only thirty-one were handled interstate, while in 1921 out L&gt;f a total of 125 cars shipped only seventeen were sent to interstate destinations. This is further borne out by the testimony of C. H. Raynolds, int general superintendent of the North Western, who submitted the records of interchange business at Hastings, sixteen miles west of Harvard, and York, thirty-two miles east, at both of which stations there are connecting tracks. In 1923, sixteen cars of grain were Transferred at Hastings from the North Western to the Burlington. None of these cars were loaded at Hastings, although consideration should be given to the fact that no elevator is located on North Western trarks at that point. At York, where there is an elevator on the North Western tracks, no cars of grain were loaded locally on the North Western and transferred to the Burlington. Five cars of grain loaded at points on the North Western other than York were transferred at the latter point to the Burlington. It Is significant, however, that thirty cars of grain were delivered to the North Western by the Burlington at York, this grain originating at points other than that station. Undoubtedly, the same inducement to move over the Burling - ton should exist at Hastings and York as at Harvard. The facts cited would indicate, however, that this inducement either did not exist, or was overcome by other market conditions. With respect to the latter, it is necessary to remember that the market conditions vary widely and fluctuate as a result of crop conditions in various sections of the United States. For instance, current market reports </seg>

Complainant's explanation of the fact that it handles a larger portion of the grain business at Harvard is that it is a cooperate concern owned by 110 farmers and that they dispose of their grain through their own company, despite the price paid by the competitor on the Burlington. It was admitted, however, that farmers other than members, sell their grain to complainant.

Aside from any question of jurisdiction, therefore, the Com- mission is of the opinion that the facts do not support the contention of complainant and would not justify an order requiring defendant railroads to incur an expense of several thousand dollars in installing the track.

RANDALL, Commissioner: This matter came on to be heard on the complaint of William R. Graham and Michael A. Roddy, running against the Missouri Pacific Railroad Corporation in Nebraska on account of inadequate crossing facilities on their premises in Otoe county, Nebraska. Hear - ing was held in the offices of the Commission November 2. 1923. when the above appearances were made and testimony was taken. The record shows that William It. Graham is the ow east one-half (Khb) of the southeast quarter (SEVi) of the north- (8) north, range thirteen (13) east, Otoe county, Nebr that William R. Graham is also the owner of the south a acres of the west half (W%) of the northwest quarter (NWH) of section thirty-one (31), township seven (7) north, range fourteen (14) east. It also shows that the Missouri Pacific Railroad Corpora - tion in Nebraska owns and operates a line of railroad through Otoe county, Nebraska, and that said railroad crosses the above described lands. Plaintiffs William R. Graham and Michael A. Roddy testified that they are deprived of the full use of their property, which has been divided by said railroad, because respondent has failed to provide an adequate crossing under its tracks. The railroad track extends in a northwesterly and southeasterly direction through the premises described above, and divides Mr. Graham's land into two parts. About twenty acres are west of the track and are used principally for pasture and the remainder, or sixty acres, is on the east side and is used for general farm purposes. It also divides the Roddy land, the smaller part being on the east side of the track and used for grazing purposes, while the improve - ments are on the larger part on the west side. The railroad crosses last quarter (NE% ) of section thirty-six (36) and that Michael A toddy Is the owner of the northeast quarter (NE'i) of the north last quarter (NEV 4 ) of section thirty-six (36), all in township cighi </seg>
            <seg id="p157">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 157 a creek on Mr. Graham's property which approaches from the west and makes a further division of his land on the west side of the track into two parts. The ground on either side of the stream is lower than the surrounding country along the railroad, and two timber bridges are used in crossing the depression, a part of which is a dry channel north of the creek. These are referred to in the testimony as the north and south bridges. The north bridge is about 100 feet in length and spans the dry channel. The south bridge is about 450 ong and extends over the creek bed and the low ground adjacent I north, which is subject to overflow. As the creek approaches the railroad from the west, it makes a sharp bend to the south on Mr. Graham's property, turns east under the south bridge and then flows north for a short distance before it resumes its original course to the east. Mr. Graham's house and buildings are on the east side of the track. These include a small grinding mill which is operated with power made from the water supplied by the creek. A dam, which consists of two timber gates, been constructed in the creek bed on the east side of the railroad. and raises the water to the level of a race which connects with the mill to the northeast. The dam was built in 1865 and was in place before the raiload was constructed. About nine years ago the size of the gates was increased to permit flood waters to pass. When they are c losed, the water above the dam is raised for some distance west the bridge. When floods occur, the creek may leave its banks at a spillway which has been provided where the stream turns south, west of the railroad bridge, and the superflow follows a natural drain - age line in a northeasterly direction under the north bridge, where it joins the original channel on the east side. A well-graded high - way extends north and south between Mr. Graham's buildings and the railroad. This is a county road which has been in use for about thirty-five years. A substantial bridge over the creek has been erected by the county at a point where it flows east after crossing under the railroad. Just north of the county bridge, and connecting with the main highway, there is a road under the north railroad bridge which is on the north bank of the overflow channel and which has been used by Mr. Graham to cross under the track since the railroad was con - structed. The record shows that in 1866, when Nebraska was a territory and before this locality had been sectionized, this road was used in traveling from Omaha to Kansas Qity and intervening points. It appears to have been laid out to conform to the topography of the country and the requirements of the time, and not with reference to property lines which were established later. It has not been used as a public highway since the country was sectionized — at least not within the memory of witnesses who have been familiar with the con- </seg>

The land we of the crossing has been fenced for a long time, and what remains of the old trail has been used by the owners of the (Iraham and Hoddy property as a private crossing under the railroad, in getting their premises. Mr. Graham can go to his laud west of the railroad nnd south of the creek by crossing under the south trestle, but it is necessary to use the north bridge to get to his spillway, look aftt cattle, or cut ice in the winter season, as the occasion may ir. The owner of the Roddy land also uses this crossing to get to or the main highway at the south end of his land. The county &gt;m- missioners who testified could not remember when the old ro been used as a public highway, and the county has refused to maintain it. On the other hand, the railroad compar repaired the crossing from time to time as the flood waters fro creek and drainage from tkm railroad ripht of way hav. dry channel wider and deeper, and the company has n wagon road to the north as these changes took place. At this tii the north bank has been cut away by erosion until the crossii narrow to permit the use of vehicles. DefeadMt con old crossing is a part of a public high way, and a abandoned; therefore the obligation to maintain i i it i and not the railroad. The fad is that the frame 1 bridge are only twelve feet apart at the rrossii contention is correct and the old road is a public highw provided an adequate crossing t This use which has been made of this road important, if not controlling, and tr P« obligation under the statute to provide an adequate erossii theory that the ground has been dedicated to the pubh true, the company has also failed to provide an adequate over a public road.

OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Chairman For and on behalf of the Farmers Union Elevator company of Lawrence, Nebraska, a member of the Nebraska Farmers Cooperative Grain and Live Stock State association, the latter organization filed complaint alleging that the said member located at Lawrence, Ne - braska, desires to ship grain over the Misisouri Pacific Railroad com - pany's lines from that point to destinations in southern Kansas and Oklahoma and that it is unable to do so by reason of the lack of transfer facilities at Lawrence; that the physical conditions at Law - rence render it relatively a simple niutt.T to construct such transfer track; and praying that the two defendants be required under the pro - visions of sections 5379 and 53S0, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, to construct such transfer facilities at the station in question. For answer the defendants allege that there is no general demand for such transfer facilities; that plaintiff alone seeks to use them in order to avail himself of the terminal facilities at Lawrence of the Missouri Pacific Railroad Corporation in Nebraska in order to move corn to points local on the Missouri Pacific in Kansas and to points where that carrier has more direct lines with its connections than does the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad company, hereinafter called the Burlington; that there is no large market for corn in that destina - tion territory except in those seasons when crop conditions are ad - verse; that the shipments affected are wholly interstate and beyond the control of the Nebraska State Railway Commission; and that whether the shipments were state or interstate, the right to compel the </seg>
            <seg id="p161">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 161 joint use of terminals by two carriers is vested wholly in tbe Interstate Commerce Commission under the amended interstate commerce act. In testimony complainant admitted that on those occasions when tin- Colorado and western Nebraska corn crop is short and the demand for corn in those localities strong, he does not have the adverse situ - ation complained of. He contends however, that the southern market in the territory which he now reaches under great difficulty is a con - sistent market for corn, that the Missouri Pacific reaches Wichita and other points in southern Kansas by direct route through traffic connec - tions, whereas the Burlington handles grain from Lawrence by way of Kansas City, or, in lieu thereof, handles such grain on the sum of the local rates to Superior and from Superior to destination. Evidence was put in the record that the Burlington's rate from Lawrence to Wichita is eight cents per cwt. higher than that of the Missouri Pacific and that track bids for Missouri Pacific loading at Lawrence are often so much higher than the bids (or Burlington loading on account of the rate dis - advantage that complainant must handle corn in competition with the elevator on the Missouri Pacific either at no profit or at actual cost In order to retain his trade. Complainant alleges that if a transfer truck existed he could secure cars from the Missouri Pacific for loading at his elevator on the Burlington and bill them out over the Missouri Pacific at tbe more favorable rate. The Missouri Pacific handles corn from its Prosser branch through tbe Superior gateway to Wichita by traffic arrangement with the Union Pacific at a rate of 19% cents per cwt. The Burlington's rate from Lawrence to Superior is 9 % cents and the local rate of the Santa Fe from Superior to Wichita is 18 cents, making the rate from Law - rente to Wichita 27% cents. This is the rate charged on shipments of corn from Lawrence over the Burlington through the Superior gateway. Rates on corn via Missouri Pacific from Lawrence to Texas com - mon point territory are the same as those of the Burlington and its connections. The Missouri Pacific has no joint rates from Lawrence to points in southern Kansas and Oklahoma off its line and on ship - ments to such destination, has only the advantage over Burlington shipments from Lawrence, comprised in the difference in the local rate via the Burlington from Lawrence to Superior and the Missouri Pacific, Lawrence to Superior, which is 2 % cents per cwt. For example on a shipment to Enid, Oklahoma, a Santa Fe point, the lowest combination of locals via the Missouri Pacific is 2S cents while the lowest com - bination via the Burlington from Lawrence is 30% cents. Both Burlington and North Western, whose lines terminate at Superior, also the Missouri Pacific, publish joint through rates on corn to Deming, New Mexico and points west thereof to California from * </seg>

The record shows that during the winter of 1 :&lt; i: 3 .

This difference appears to be entirely due l-J rate disadvantage under which complainant is operating (or all shipments into the destination territory under consideration, all such shipments would be interstate. This relates to corn only. The complainant was in no position to testify as to possible or probable other business which might use the transfer if one existed and the record is silent on that matter. UBoth defendants challenged the this complaint because power of this Commission to act (a) All the traffic affected is interstate; and, CoMplainanl adnlta tbal he is interested in the corn movement alone and that his wheat does not move into the territory about which II he complains. The record shows that it all Murlington shipments of corn from Lawrence were moved through the Superior gateway during the past ten years, there was only an average of twenty-six cars a year affected. If this is a fair measure of the maximum possihle transfer at Lawrence, it would lie the measare of the volume of tratlic which the record shows would he handled over a transfer track under proper transfer tariff provisions. However, if complainant is so well situated locally that he could secure all the corn husiness at Lawrence if a transfer track existed. th&gt; average movement from that station that might use the transfer track would be 1«H cars mor« . To the i that some corn from Lawrence would move to other destinations, this probable transfer volume in sight would he reduced Complainant does not say he lost business by reason of hil rate disadvaiitai:. . hut that he overcame this disadvantage only at serious nnancial 1 There is a considerable movement of corn from Nebraska points of origin through Superior to southwestern territory and point*- thereof as far as California.

Against the attitude of a hostile carrier nly complaint to the interstate commerce commission and favorable action by that body on the complaint, could secure the relief complain - nt in this case ia seeking. This is not an insuperable objection. If be facts warrant a transfer track, the same facts would warrant tariff rovisions for its use. There appears, however, to be a more desirable method of meeting the conditions complained of than that suggested n the pleadings. The natural desire of the Burlington is to retain the long haul on grain from southwestern Nebraska destined to southern Kansas. Okla - loma and Texas points. This desire may have been the reason that no oint rates have been made through the Superior gateway on grain to ioint8 intermediate to Deming. New Mexico. The movement of grain rom Burlington points of origin in southwestern Nebraska to this ntermediate consuming territory either on the sum of the locals on Superior, or via the Kansas City gateway, constitutes a definite rate tandicap and results in much round-about hauling. This rate structure presents an artificial barrier between certain producing and consulti - ng territory. There appears to be no good reason why the Burlington should not attempt to give its patrons the advantage of the consuming terri - ory in Oklahoma and southern Kansas that would result from the mblication of through rates or at least in some manner meeting the ompetition of other carriers with more direct lines. Joint rates hrough Superior might not fully meet that competitive situation, but would improve the present conditions materially, and probably ufflciently. Complainant suffers especially by reason of local competition of ealers more favorably located from the rate point of view. But tf tho movement of grain, from Lawrence to Wichita for example, on the sum of the local rates on Superior, constitutes an unreasonably high charge, hat fact is equally true of other points on the Burlington desiring to nter the same market and having to do so by paying the sum of the ocals on Superior or by moving via Kansas City. Outside of the com - petitive situation shown particularly for Lawrence, Burlington stations n southwestern Nebraska west of the Prosser line of the Missouri Pacific, and stations on the Burlington and North Western lor a short istance east of this Missouri Pacific line are suffering a direct handicap. kA transfer track at Lawrence with proper tariff provisions for 1U e would only aid Burlington shippers of corn at that one point, ithout the existence of joint rates, no other point would secure relief. </seg>
            <seg id="p165">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 165 With joint rates through Superior, a transfer track at Lawrence would be unessential. It follows that the preferable procedure here to relieve a situation which appears to be unwarranted, is not to secure purely local adjust - ment but adjustment over a wider territory. The carriers should publish joint rates to Oklahoma and southern Kansas consuming terri- hrough Superior, avoiding thereby the imposition of the sum of eals on a considerable actual and potential traffic.

Appearances: For Complainant, Ralph road, attorney. For Defendant, H. J. Connell, attorney. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Chairman Chiefly this complaint centers on unusual and excessively crowded conditions in morning and evening traffic on the so-called Leavenworth line on that portion south of Farnam street, and, second, on the need of morning and evening service over the usually unused line from Sixtieth and Mason Streets to a loop on the east side of the Ak-Sar-Ben field. Subsidiary to these chief points of complaint were allegations of crowded peakload conditions on the Benson, Florence, Dodge and Cross-town lines. Complainant's attorney dismissed the subsidiary complaints and the hearing, which was held at Omaha on February IS and 19, was confined to the chief points named above. All witnesses lived west of Forty-eighth and Leavenworth. The Commission has letters of complaint from citizens living east of that &gt;oint, but they are not of record. These witnesses were all able to board the cars in the morning when going to work, but all were able o testify that east of Forty-eighth street and west of Park avenue the conditions became so congested that people desiring to board the cars were unable to do so. Hence, on the question of the morning con - gestion the witnesses rather appeared for others than for themselves. More emphasis was placed on the evening congested period. The witnesses all work in the central part of town and board the cars any - where from Fifteenth and Davenport to Twenty-fourth and Leaven - worth. Testimony was that this congestion began as far north as Fifteenth and Davenport and that from Fifteenth and Farnum to Six - teenth and Howard a very usual experience was inability to board the first car in the direction of home. At times the congestion was so Congested Train* </seg>
            <seg id="p169">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 169 serious that waits of fifteen to thirty minutes were experienced where the headway of car service is five minutes. There was also complaint of uncomfortable congestion in the cars experienced by those who were able to get on. Suggestions of remedy on the part of complainants included the running of the extra cars now used to handle the heavy traffic through to Sixtieth and Mason streets, whereas they now run only to Forty - eighth and Leavenworth, and the further suggestion that more cars should be furnished to handle the heavy load. The testimony was con - tradictory as to whether the serious disadvantage as pictured existed only in periods of storm stress, or were regularly experienced. From rather wide experience in matters of this kind the Commission reaches the conclusion that the storm difficulties are the chief cause of the complaints and that some of the witnesses merely remembered the in - stances without connecting them up with the congestion caused by th« riding of people who in favorable weather either walked or drove private conveyances. The company uses regularly 113 cars In its Omaha service. That Is, this is the measure of necessities in the off-peak periods of the day. Street car service is periodical, the chief demand being during one hour of the morning and one hour in the evening. To handle this sudden rush of traffic the company adds 117 additional cars in the morning and 132 cars in the evening. It also has available certain ad - ditional equipment which it throws into service where the need appears greatest. The number thus used ranges from nineteen to thirty and is used only in periods of emergency, such as inclement weather. To handle the traffic on the line here under consideration the com - pany adds enough cars to double the service as far west as Forty-eighth and Leavenworth. The service between Forty-eighth and Leavenworth and Sixtieth and Mason remains constant throughout the twenty hours of the day. Thus, in the heavy traffic periods, morning and evening, there is ten-minute service between Sixtieth and Mason and Forty - eighth and Leavenworth and five-minute service between Forty-eighth and Leavenworth and Twenty-ninth and Park. Between Twenty-ninth and Park and the points of debarkation the service is very »requeu' because of the addition of cars from the so-called East Park and West Park lines running over the tracks on Leavenworth. That territory is not under survey. i The company's plan is to have one car in service during the heavy traffic period for each seventy passengers desiring service. It estimates the necessities from traffic checks and arranges its schedule as near as may be to have one car operating for each seventy passengers desiring to ride. </seg>

At the present time com - plainants who live near enough to this extension to desire service over t have to walk a maximum of three-fourths of a mile either to the Leavenworth line, or to the Center street line. There are no sidewalks lecause the territory is not yet built up sufficiently to warrant the ex - tense of such improvements. Complainants say that since the company has the line there they hould offer morning and evening service for a period of two hours in order to relieve these citizens of the long walk. It is complainants' opinion that such short period service would pay the operating ex - penses of the car at least. It is out of the question to extend the line service because such extension would disrupt the existing schedules on Leavenworth street. Complainants recognize this and propose a stub line service similar to the West Lawn service. The company presented studies made on two different days of the number of people from the territory under consideration who rode heir cars. They showed a maximum of sixty people per day walking rom or to the so-called Ak-Sar-Beu territory for distances more than hree blocks from the existing terminus of street railway service. It is particularly noticeable that during the periods checked there was very little peak-load traffic. The sixty people were spread fairly evenly hroughout the day. This would lead one to conclude that the pro - iosed morning and evening service would benefit only a small portion of the rather meager traffic possible. The company should be, and says that it is, interested in en - couraging development of outlying territory by persons who may live at the present time within walking distance of places of employment, t is recognized as sound policy to furnish service In outlying territory somewhat In advance of the time when such service pays. Such developmental service calls for the use of surpluses earned elsewhere on the system. The difficulty here is that this company is earning no such surpluses. Complainants offered little which would indicate that this pro - posed extension of service would even pay the wages of the man who operated the car. The territory is not large and complainants could readily have canvassed the territory to ascertain the names and resi - dences of all reasonably located patrons of the street railway company living south of Pacific street and adjacent to the extension, and the hours when they take the street car and when they return. Such a study submitted as evidence would be very good proof of the capacity of the territory to pay the direct operating expense of the car service sought. Without such evidence we have only the study of the company. </seg>
            <seg id="p173">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 173 which shows that on a twenty-minute headway not more than six persons would have used a car on any one trip. Of course, if such periodic service were offered there would be an effort on the part of rved to plan their trips to the city so as to avail themselves of the service. But the effect is only conjectural. We think complain - ants should make a more careful study of the possibilities of the territory before we should be asked to require the company to put service on for a trial period. We will enter no order of dismissal on the proposed extended service as yet and will give complainants ample time to make such studies as we suggest. If they do not desire to do this, we will in due course of time enter an order of dismissal without prejudice to again bringing the question up when the territory shall have developed somewhat farther.

The volume of travel over the crossing under existing conditions raiinot be taken as a measure of the local requirements or what It would be if the objectional features were removed. There was little or no conflict in the testimony as to existing physical conditions. The curve in the road and the steep grade on the east side of the track considered in connection with the railroad crossing create a situation which should be corrected and the question here is which remedy shall be applied. The railroad company contended that the approach on the east :-i(le of the track should be lengthened whereby the grade might be i educed to six per cent and the company offered to pay twelve hundred dollars as its share of the cost in making this change. If the expense exceeds this sum it would be borne by the county. This would be an improvement over existing conditions, but would not eliminate the hazard of crossing the track at grade. Moreover, the proposed approach would contain two curves and reach a height of approxi - mately twenty feet near the railroad right of way which would require the erection of guard rails to protect the traveler on the public way The county maintained that an undergrade crossing is a logical solution of the problem under existing conditions. This would eliminate the hazards of a high approach and crossing at grade. The railroad embankment is high enough to afford the required clearance of fourteen feet for a crossing under the track. The railroad company showed that six span timber bridge would be required to pro - vide such an opening and that it would cost J3.045. exclusive of ex - cavation below the stringers. If the grading on the east side of the track Is done at the expense of the company the county would still have to provide a drainage opening under the approach and improve the approach on the west side of the track. The result would be that the railroad and the county together would spend a substantial sum in Improvements and the highway would still have the grade crossing and the curves which are not advisable where they can be avoided. The Commission does not feel that the entire burden of correct - ing this situation should fall upon the railroad as the duty of the public to construct and maintain its highways is well established. The equities of the situation suggest that the counties Involved should join with the railroad company in the expense of the improvements necessary to protect travelers on the public highway and In addition thereto, the county should provide rights of way, if any, which are necessary for the new alignment. The Commission believes and so finds that the crossing complain- </seg>
            <seg id="p177">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 177 ed of is dangerous and inadequate and that an undergrade crossing under the defendant's track on the county line is required for the pro - tection and necessity of the public, whether passengers on the railroad or travelers on the public way, and a conditional order will be entered which will provide that the defendant shall erect a structure on the county line in accordance with the plans submitted by the company and made a part of the record in this case, which will afford an oppor - tunity for an undergrade crossing on the public highway, provided that the county shall perform all the excavation necessary, both on the county line and on the railroad right of way, below the bottom of the stringers of the bridge, necessary and sufficient to provide the opening under the track that is required. Defendant has raised the question of the power of the Commission to compel railroads to establish and maintain overhead or under - ground highway crossings. In support of this position the company quotes Section 5526, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, which i« quoted as follows: "Wherever any railroad track shall cross any such way in a cut, or on a curve, or side hill, or in timber lands, or near build - ings, or near any obstruction of the view from the way, the Com - mission shall direct such precautions to be taken as it shall deem necessary for the safety of the traveling public, the facts having been developed either on the motion of the Commission, or upon complaint of interested parties. Each and every railroad com - pany shall also provide and maintain such gates, crossings, signs, alarm bells, and flag men, as the Commission shall direct. The Commission may adopt some uniform crossing signs, which shall be placed at any crossing and at such other places as the Com - mission may direct. The Commission may direct the placement of special signs where the physical conditions of any crossing warrant such action." This section appears to deal with things which may obstruct the view of a traveler when near a railroad and gives the Commission the power to order the placement of gates, signs, alarm bells, etc., to pro - tect and warn travelers on a highway. It assumes that the approaches to the track are adequate and sufficient for the use of the public and does not describe the situation we have in this case. We find Section 5525 of the same volume which Is quoted aa follows "The state railway commission shall have jurisdiction over all crossings of highways outside of incorporated villages, towns and cities, both public and private, across, over, or nnder all railroads in the State of Nebraska whether such railroads are operated by steam, electricity, or other power, and shall make such rules and regulations for the construction, repair and main - tenance thereof as the commission shall deem adequate and suffic- </seg>

The contents and charges on the shipment just mentioned were shown to be as follows: A representative shipment Omaha to Brownville shows the following Lumber 19860 pds. rate l»Hc Cement 5000 pds. rate 23.5c Hardware 320 pds. rate 34c Complainants do not ask that building hardware be included with mixed carloads of lumber and cement as a part of the lumber minimum weight. Mr. Platner witness for the complainant gave the following testimony "Another reason why this rate should be reduced Is the fact that every town in the state of Nebraska, or practically every town, has the same incoming freight rate as does Omaha, and our handicap on lumber alone, would be the rate from Omaha to the point of destin - ation. This same thing holds true in a great many cases with cement." Again on this point: "Hay Springs would cost 30 cents a barrel more direct from the mill and ours cost $2.40 a barrel more. In other words. Hay Lumber 33640 pds. rate 33c charges $ (111.0 Jement and plaster 16500 pds. rate 59.2c charges 97.6 hardware 1520 pds. rate 87c charges 13.2 </seg>

The testimony in this case appears to us to in substance ask le Commission to give controlling consideration to commercial con- Itions, and order the rail carriers to establish a mixing rule for lipments of lumber, cement, lime and plaster directly opposite to he general western classification mixed carload rule, so that the com - laints — the Farmers Lumber company of Omaha, can in a measure Ter come the state-wide rate adjustment, which allows the interior umber and building material dealers to get their lumber from the mills in the Pacific northwest at the same rate in cents per cwt. that le complainant pays for the lumber received from the same point f origin at Omaha, and at approximately the same rate for shipment f cement, lime and plaster.

Rule Ten of Western Classification provides that commodities with arload ratings in the classification may be shipped in mixed carloads t the highest rate and highest minimum of any commodity loaded in le car. This rule has been passed on by the Interstate Commerce ommission and found reasonable and we do not in this record find any reason why we should at this time direct a different rule he es - ablished on carload shipment of the commodities shipped by the omplainants herein. </seg>

The roads leading into Grainton several miles north and south are much better for the haul - ing of grain and produce to market than they are leading to Klsie and Wallace, which makes the town of Grainton an advanta ous point for the shipment of grain, livestock and produce. At prowl there are tour general stores, a hardware store, a bank an &gt;in» other business houses, and two grain elevators of quite larui cap v at Grainton.

The complainants insisted strongly on an agent who is an operator being placed at Grainton so that it would obviate the necessity of telephoning messages and that all express and L. C.

The railroad company made a proposition to place a man as cart taker at that station, directing him to spend at least four hours eac destination of the shipments made from that point. The L. &lt; !le shipments from and into QrmtatoB have not been of very magnitude but are steadily Increasing as the town and MX tributary becomes settled. The I.. ('.

Browne, Chairman. Attest: John E. Curtiss, Secretary. (SEAL&gt; FORMAL COMPLAINT NO. 50© C. S. KiMer, et al., Complainants, v. Chicago &amp; North Western Railway Company, Defendant Appearances: For complainants, W. C. Heelan, attorney. For defendant, G. A. Holmes, division superintendent; F. E. Borton, trainmaster; Wymer Dressier, attorney. BROWNE, Chairman Complainants in this case are business men of the village of Merriman and business men of the interior town of Martin, South Dakota. They allege inadequate station help since the removal by de - fendant of an operator who served between the hours of 4 p. m. and midnight. This curtailment of service occurred February 27, 1924. Prior to the reduction in station help service at Merriman, the station was open from 8 a. m. to 12 a. m. Citizens desiring to trans - act certain kinds of business were accommodated during these hours. Since the reduction of service, the business hours at the station are from 8 a. m. to 5 p. m. On behalf of complainants jt was testified that Merriman is the railroad point for a very wide territory, extending northward to and including the territory around the county seat of Bennett County, South Dakota and southward over a considerable area of grazing or sand hill country containing certain interior postofflces. The competing railroad points to the south of Merriman are sixty miles distant; to the north, almost one hundred miles. Merriman, although a relatively small point, originates and terminates business in sufficient quantities to receive credit for approximately $45,000 earnings per annum. An unusual amount of this for a small country station is less than carload freight. </seg>
            <seg id="p190">190 Eis less than carload freight volume is due to the interior towns who eive their freight shipments and forward less than carload produce m Merriman. It was testified for complainants that truck lines operate into nd out of Merriman; that the routes of these truck lines extend con - iderable distances and the round trip takes many hours of time each ay. If trucks remain at Merriman until the way freight arrives from le east, which way freight handles the refrigerator perishables, it is ery difficult to transport the load to the interior town of Martin, outh Dakota, and return in time to bill out produce before the station loses and the agent goes off duty. bit was also alleged that the station is negligently maintained er hours, although local passenger service is offered during the iod when the agent is not on duty. For defendant it was stated that the hours of service are reason - able and correspond fairly well with those of other businesses; that the operator who was removed had not been maintained at Merriman on account of local necessities, but rather on account of train oper - ations; that with the reduction in quantity of train service, due to re- Ection of business, it was found pntc tii -able to remove &amp; make reduction of expenses paralleling reductior ne; and that when business laereMM Mm operator wil Station service by defendant common carrier must he reasonably ufflcient to meet the requirements of the community. At the same ime, the practices of the community must, to a reasonable deirree, be made to fit the opportunities of transacting business with defendant. When the rule of reasonableness has beea met, patrons of tli&gt; eomaraa arrier must shape their business practice! in dealing wttfc the com - mon carrier as they do in dealing with each other. The whole question lere is, therefore, whether the hours of service now proffered reason - bly meet the necessities of the territory served from Meriin.aii. A large proportion of small country stations in Nebr.'Ua. not only n defendant's lines but on other railroads, receive service fror the gent between the hours of 8 a. m. and 5 p. in. This it the .

            <seg id="p192">192 FORMAL COMPLAINT NO. SOS Village of Ralston, Complainant, y. Nick Salistean, Defendant. Appearances For complainant, W. W. Wenstrand. For lntenrenors, Village of Papillion, Ralph G. Nickerson, A. E. Langdon, attorneys; Omaha &amp; Lincoln Railway ft Light Company, Brogan, Ellick &amp; Raymond, attorneys. For defendent, James E. Bednar, attorney. BROWNE, Chairman: The village of Ralston is a municipal corporation, lying several miles west of the south portion of the city of Omaha. The village of apillion lies two or three miles beyond the village of Ralston. The maha and Lincoln Railway and Light Company operates an in - erurban railway between Twenty-fourth and X streets, in the city of maha, and Papillion, Nebraska, with the town of Ralston inter - mediate. It also operates certain cars for passenger and express over racks of another company to Sixteenth and Capitol Avenue, Omaha. ■efendant is a private person opening common carrier bus service between Ralston and Twenty-fourth and N streets, Omaha, in senii - artnership arrangement with R. Turturan. These two individuals ach operate common carrier busses over the same route and have jointly entered into financial obligations, including the signing of chattel mortgages with reference to property used in this passenger transportation business. k During the month of May, these busses started operating on a ved highway between exactly the same termini as, and practically rrallei to, the interurban railway. Complainant, Village of Ralston, says that it does not desire to have these busses operating into and out of its borders for the con - venience of its citizens, because it fears that the more stable service of the interurban railway may be rendered so improfitable as to eliminate it. The prayer of its petition is that the Commission exercise powers alleged to exist to the extent of ordering the discontinuance of the duplicated service, to the end that such revenues as are derived from handling passengers between Omaha and Ralston may be secured by one concern; but if the Commission refuses to command the dis - continunace of the motor service or finds that it has not the authority to require the discontinuance, in that event petitioner asks that the </seg>
            <seg id="p193">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 193 maximum amount of service be rendered to citizens of Ralston that can be secured from competing common carrier concerns. It would have the Commission require observance of schedules which would give the greatest number of opportunities of transportation. It desires the Commission to establish the fares of the bus company as it has those of the interurban, to issue regulations relative to safety of operation, to require standby equipment as protection of regularity of service by the bus line, and to require liability insurance, the allega - tion being made that the operators of the bus line would have no juate liability otherwis Complainant also asks that the Commission issue a general order lirint: that before any other common carriers than those now in iWmi shall enter the field they shall first secure from the Com - lission a certificate of necessity and convenience to the end that ervice may not be duplicated in such manner as to injure the ulti- mate public service, and to the further end that bus lines operating between Ralston and Omaha may not continue to spring up, if no need exists for them. The village of Papillion's interest is that interurban service is ■ necessary to the convenience of its citizens and they want the r. venues of this company protected to whatever degree is advisable and proper. J. H. Harder, a citizen residing intermediate to Ralsfon and Omaha, together with approximately one hundred others, intervenes to the same purpose as complainant village of Ralston. The interurban railway company intervenes with approximately the same prayer as that of the village of Ralston. The issues were joined by answers from defendant and a hearing was held in Omaha on July 2 and July 3. Witnesses for complainant testified that there had been ample experience with bus lines; that they were irregular, irresponsible and not permanent; that permanent transportation service is all-fmportant to the town; that the interurban considerably increased its service until now it is quite satisfactory by Itself without added transportation service of bus lines; that it fears defendants are merely transitory, but that they may remain in the business long enough to force discontinuance of service by the In - terurban greatly to the detriment of the village of Ralston. It was alleged further that the operations are unsafe and that the bus line runs practically at the same times and along the same route as the interurban. merely dividing the business without giving any added convenience to the public!. There was a large amount of testimony regarding the facts and considerable difference of statement as to those facts. </seg>
            <seg id="p194">194 SEVENTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT tThe testimony is ample to prove that the bus line operates during k-load demands, on very nearly the same schedule as the railway ipany; that there is a great deal of friction between employees of interurban and those of the bus company, resulting in actions nical to the safety of passengers, and that the financial standing of bus operators is doubtful enough to render improbable recovery m injured passengers in case of accident unless insurance policies carried. In brief, attorneys for intervenors, the interurban company, rongly urge upon the Commission that it require the discontinuance ! operation by defendant bus owners as unnecessary and inimical to le continued proper public service and that a general order be entered, enying future common carriers the right to enter the field of service ntil they have shown reasonable necessity for such service. It Is rged upon the Commission that the power exists under the con - titutional enactment creating the Commission, and that in case the ommission finds the duplicated service unnecessary, it is its duty o correct the evil and to prevent its repetition. Respondents admit lat the Commission's jurisdiction is wide enough for it to issue rders regarding the schedules and the rates and safety rules applying o respondents, but that its power does not extend to prohibition of peration. Various cases in support of their contentions were cited n both briefs. Argument of counsel tor intervenors is cogent but Is not strong nouch to warrant the Commission in reversing its conclusions reached fter mature consideration in its findings on F. C. 437 (O. &amp; L. Ry. &amp; .t. Co. v. Henry 14 N. S. R. C. 160-170; 15 N. S. R. C. 156-163) where t was stated that the Commission does not now have the power to re - uire a certificate of necessity and convenience precedent to the enter - ng into any particular field of a common carrier public utility. It will in this case adhere to that conclusion and will not enter a general rder as prayed for. The Commission is not unmindful of the possibilities of the un - estrained multiplication of passenger carrying vehciles in common arrier service operating between the same termini. Many of these are &gt;eing operated by persons of no financial standing and under cir - umstances which render them but transitory additions to the public service. They may, however, have the effect of so dividing the revenues obtained from transportation as to seriously endanger continuance of service by those common carriers which have financial stability and which are most likely to continue to serve. These problems, however, appear to us to be matters to be presented to the legislature. It is the duty of the Commission, however, to see that common </seg>
            <seg id="p195">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 195 carrier transportation companies operate in such manner as will render the maximum service to the public, permissible under the rate* paid, and to render that service with due care for the safety of those who entrust their lives to such concerns. It is the duty of the Com - mission, as we conceive it, to require that in case a serious accident occurs, in spite of careful rules of operation, the victims of such ac- ident shall have compensation for their injuries In morning and evening the demands of the public for trans - portation conveniences between business and home are greatest, and during those periods of greatest demand and greatest traffic the maximum amount of service should be offered. The schedules of the bus operators and those of tBe interurban company most nearly duplicate in these periods when duplication of service should be least. The testimony does not indicate that there is not, by either bus operators or interurban. sufficient capacity to handle the traffic. The convenience of the public, however, includes frequency of opportunity to be transported. We will require such schedules as to bring to pass the greatest measure of service practicable under the circumstances. We do not feel that this interurban company, which has been operating on stated schedules for years, should be required to change those schedules. The later comer should, in our opinion, be required to so observe schedules as will fit in best with what is already In the Held without duplicating that service. During the taking of testimony it was disclosed that defendant Salistean has a partner, or at least a co-operator, engaged in the same bus line service and filling out the samel schedule. It can hardly be said that the two are in partnership, although a semi-partnership re - lationship appears to exist. The other bus operator between the two points most interested in this controversy is R. Turturan, who appeared in the case in defense of his practices and activities and those of Salistean. The order that we enter in this case will apply to both and to their successors and assigns. It is the duty of the Commission to see that common carrier service once established shall continue until authority is given to discontinue. Such authority must in law be given where the business does not financially justify continuance. The rule has been hard of application to bus common carrier operators, be - cause of the very transitory nature of the business and the lack of financial stability and integrity that inheres in almost all this supple - mental passenger transportation service. With respect to the rates and charges for service by defendants, we will make no order until such time as other common carrier but transportation companies are likewise regulated as to rates or until </seg>

De - dants are charging lower rates than the railway transportation lpany, but this condition is likewise generally true of the bus line ipetitors of Nebraska railways and call for no different treatment.

            <seg id="p198">198 SEVENTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT FORMAL COMPLAINT NO. 505 Fay C. Hill, et al.. Complainants. v Chicago ft North Western Railway Company, Defendant. Appearances: For complainants. Fay C. Hill. For defendant, G. A. Holmes, division superintendent, F. E. Borton, trainmaster, Wymer Dressier, attorney RANDALL, Commissioner: Complainants in this case are business men of the city of Gordon. and business men of six towns on the Pine Ridge reservation, and tock shippers tributary to Gordon. They allege inadequate station lelp since the removal by the defendant of a helper at the station. owing to the fact that Gordon supplies several trading posts on the 'ine Ridge reservation, as freight to towns of the Pine Ridge reserva - ion is freighted by team and truck from Gordon to points thirty to izty miles distant; that the traders at those points send in produce &gt;y the teams and trucks on their return journey to be billed out and hipped by the railway company, either by freight or express; and hat owing to lack of help on the arrival of I.. C. L. freight and poduce from the east on freight trains, that arrive from 1 2 : 3 o to 1:30 each day, it is a physical impossibility for the agent to check out the freight received to these trucks and freighters so that thev can be loaded in time to make the trip to the Pine Ridge agency and return in time to bill out the produce trucked in from the Pine Ridge reservation, as under the present arrangements the depot is closed to he receiving and billing of freight and express at 5 o'clock p. m. This case was heard in Gordon, Nebraska, on June 12. A large amount of testimony was introduced by the complainants showing that he volume of business done at that town was of considerable magni - ude; that there were several teams and trucks transporting goods to and from the station, and to the rural country and the Pine Itidge agency, to stores located on the agency and that there were three dray lines in the city transporting goods from the depot and set-out car to the merchants in the town. The testimony showed that the agent would go into the set-out car and stay there continuously from he time the car was opened until the entire merchandise was checked out and that any L. C. L. freight or express that happened to be at he freight house could not be obtained until he had finished his work in the set-out car. It was shown that the defendant company have three trick telegraph operators at Gordon and an agent. Gordon </seg>
            <seg id="p199">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 199 is not a division point and therefore the operators' time is not entirely consumed in attending to the telegraph business. Operators are on duty continuously for the twenty-four hours of the day. The agent does not go on until eight o'clock a. m., is off one hour for noon, and then is on until 5 o'clock p. m. The operators are on duty continuously and could serve the public in the delivery of express and L. C. L. freight in the freight room from the opening hours in the morning until 6 p. m. continuously, including the noon hour, without any additional expense to the railway company, and to the advantage of the public and the betterment of the service. The defendant company claimed that the operators were expected to wait on customers in selling of tickets, delivering of express and freight, also the billing of express and freight during the hours that the depot was open for business, which was from 8 o'clock a. m. to 5 o' clock p. m., but it was shown by the testimony that these operators were not rendering this service to the public as was required by the railway company and also that no freight or express could be received or delivered after 5 o'clock p. m. The complainants insisted strongly that the only cure for the lack of service at the station would be the reinstatement of the helper in order to handle the business. The Commission has made a careful survey of the matter and considered all the testimony and believes that the company at present has sufficient help to perform all the duties that are necessary for the convenience of the public, providing, however, that they require the telegraph operators to look after the receiving and delivering of express and L&gt;. C. L., freight, the same as is done by the agent. It was clearly shown, however, that 5 o'clock p. m. was too early an hour to close the depot for the rural community to be served and that it should be kept open for the convenience of the public until 6 o'clock p. m.. for the billing and delivery of express and L. C. L. freight, but that all carloads could be billed by the agent before going off duty at 5 p. m. This situation we find to constitute an emergency. Regarding the stock yards situation at Gordon, the testimony showed that the stock yards were in very good condition but that facilities for getting the stock into the yards from the street were inadequate and also facilities for the loading of the stock, as there was only one loading chute, so that only one carload could be loaded at a time. The class of stock offered to the railway company for shipment is largely of a wild and undomesticated nature and it re - quires careful handling to get them into the yards. There is at the present time only one gate at the southeast corner of the yards for *he driving of stock Into the yards. Leading out from the southeast corner of the yards is a gathering fence of about six 16 ft. lengths. The west side of the gateway has no gathering fence, hence the stock </seg>
            <seg id="p200">200 then driven into this gateway, stampede and scatter around over le adjoining dooryards and gardens to the great damage to the people living adjoining to the yards, and also to the great incon - venience of the shippers. If this gate on the southeast corner of the yards were changed around to the east side of the yards, adjoining he corner where it is now located, or if another gate was installed, eaving the gate where it now is, and a gathering fence, equal in ength to the one already there, was built directly straight east of he gateway, so that the newly constructed gathering fence and the &gt;resent gathering fence would form an east and north enclosure, this stock could be handled to a great deal better advantage and with much less inconvenience, not only to the shippers but would practically obviate the damage that is now accruing to the adjoining property lolders by reason of the stock breaking away from the present gate and running at large over the dooryards and gardens. LThe Commission, however cannot require the building of this thering fence, as this condition was not part of the pleadings, but recommends that it be constructed to conform to the wishes of the stock shippers at this point, (as Gordon is a very heavy stock shipping town and the railway company are receiving a large amount of revenue from the business offered them by the stock shippers and it would seem reasonable that their wishes should be considered by the railway company, especially where they are as reasonable as these wishes are they should be at once supplied.) The question of an extra chute for the loading of livestock is a matter presented under the pleadings. After listening to the testimony and making a personal investigation, the Commission feels that the request for the extra chute is a reasonable one. At the present time only one carload can be loaded at one time. If a chute was constructed along the west side of the present yard, practically in line with the scales, at the west side of the yard, the gathering yard could be constructed at a very nominal expense; no requirement of more trackage would be necessary and the stock loading would be greatly facilitated, and would not only be a saving of time to the shippers, but to the railway company, as a train could be loaded practically twice as quickly as at the present time, and the element of time saving to the railway com - pany in their crews would in a very short time more than pay for the expense of the extra chute and it would be a permanent improvement that is not only much desired by the shippers but is absolutely necessary for the requirements of handling stock at that point.

L. Root, attorney; Frank R. Mullen, division superintendent. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE. Chairman Complainant alleges that it is at this time operating a sandpit immediately adjacent to trackage of defendant company in the </seg>
            <seg id="p202">202 SEVENTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT southern limits of the city of Grand Island; that it desires to ship sand and gravel in carload quantities, and to that end has requested of defendant opportunity to toad cars from the trackage immediately adjacent to the sandpit; that this request has been denied; that defendant has offered as an alternative to construct a side-track con - nected by switches at each end of the trackage already existing for the purpose of serving applicant company, which construction, it is estimated would cost complainant $3,000; that this cost is excessive and unreasonable and constitutes discrimination; that defendant company permits other industries and individuals to load and unload cars in a manner similar to that requested by complainant and its refusal to permit complainant likewise to use the existing trackage constitutes unjust discrimination in violation of the laws of the state of Nebraska. Two main points are presented in the complaint and in the testimony in support thereof: (a) Is the carrier justified in refusing to permit loading of sand and gravel into cars on the trackage immediately adjacent to the sandpit of complainant, and does such refusal constitute unjust discrimination? (b) If the first question is answered in the negative, is defend - ant making unjust, excessive and unreasonable demands on com - plainant as a condition to rendering service for the loading in car - load quantities of sand and gravel for movement in intrastate com - merce. Defendant has a switching line which leaves its main line some - where near the Grand Island station facilities of defendant and circles the south half of the city crossing the north and south streets and terminating just beyond the plant of the American Sugar com - pany. Originally this line extended around west and north of the city and connected with the main line. It constituted a belt line and was intended to serve a series of industries to be located adjacent to the trackage. A spur or blind-end track branches from this so - called belt line at its intersection with Locust Street. It is used as a team track. A privately owned stockyards is located at another point, the chute being available for loading on the main belt track. The sugar company has a series of tracks for switching purposes branching from this main belt line which dead-ends just west of the factory. Complainant's pumping plant is so located that he could con - struct loading bins partly on the right of way of defendant and load therefrom by gravity immediately into gondola cars on the main belt </seg>
            <seg id="p203">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 203 track. It is complainant's contention that he should be allowed so to load and should not be required to expend considerable sums of money in building a branch track. In support of this contention testimony was given to show that considerable quantities of materials have been unloaded at points on the main belt track in the same manner as they would have been unloaded from a team track on an industry or house track. Inasmuch as the carrier has been able to operate the belt line when such business was going on, complainant says that it can operate while he uses the same track for the loading of sand and gravel, and that to deny to this applicant what has been allowed to others in the way of service, is unjust discrimination. Defendant admits the use of the trackage in the loading and unload - ing of miscellaneous materials, but points out that such permits was temporary, and only at periods of the year when switching to and from the sugar factory was at a minimum. Except for isolated instances where single cars of building materials have been unloaded for private parties, temporary permit to use the belt line for unload - ing and loading has been in the construction of the municipal sewer disposal plant and in the construction of a semi-public hospital not far distant. It is alleged further by defendant that the partial blocking of the trackage extended for only brief intervals, whereas complainant de - sires to load from five and ten cars of sand and gravel daily throughout the season when such commodities are mined, namely; from April to the middle of November. The testimony is uncontradicted that defendant handles in switching service on this so-called belt line 500 or more carloads per annum of which the major part is business of the sugar factory in - bound and outbound. The heavy movement of freight to the sugar factory occurs from September 15 to December 31, although more than 100 cars appear to have moved in 1923 at other than the sugar refining season. Defendant's witness testified that it must transact switching service with the sugar factory almost every day. Complainant's plant is located between the main track of de - fendant and the sugar factory. If complainant had caps on this track loaded, empty or in process of loading at the sand pit when the defendant has switching business at the sugar factory, they must by defendant be got out of the way, either by setting them on side tracks at the sugar factory temporarily or by hauling such cars to the Locust Street team tracks spur. Complainant points to the same necessity where materials are being unloaded on the main belt track or where livestock is being loaded or unloaded at the stockyards. The situations are not parallel or identical. Livestock is loaded or unloaded immediately and quickly while the switch engine is in attendance. Cars are not left spotted at the stock chute. This does </seg>
            <seg id="p204">204 SEVENTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT not constitute an obstruction to other switching movement. Per - mission to use the belt line track for unloading at special times when he switching necessities were light, was an exercise of reasonable liscretion, which permission could have been terminated as soon aa it constituted an interference with their business. It was a matter of convenience in the terminal handling of quantities of materials for public service. It appears to be quite different than the proposed use of this main belt track for continuing and daily all day use by complainant throughout the seven active months of sand mining. Defendant is justified in its refusal. We come now to consideration of the second main cause of complaint, namely; that the demand that complainant pay the entire cost of a switch track connected at both ends with the main belt line and approximately 7 50 feet in length as a preliminary to service by defendant is unreasonable and excessive. The standard practice of defendant in dealing with industries is to require that the full cost of labor and material shall be paid by the industry from the switch point to the end of track and that the ap - plicant industry shall either do by itself or pay for the cost of grading. An applicant industry is required to deposit the estimated cost and in the event that such amount is more than the actual cost, refund is made to the industry. That is the proposal in this case. Plaintiff said that the cost to him, unless he would use the main line for loading Crposes, should not exceed $500 or $600, whereas the defendant imates the construction as insisted upon by it will cost $2900. Many years ago the practice of the carriers was to construct hese industrial tracks for private parties without cost to the in - ividual. Later, this practice was changed and the industry was re - uired to pay the first cost, which advance costs were refunded on the asis of $2.00 per car on freight originating at the industry. Still ater, including the period just prior to Federal control the practice was to require the total cost to be paid by the industry. If the trackage were later used in serving another industry an adjustment of cost was made and a refund to the original or first industry. During the period of federal control the standard rule required the carrier to pay the cost of the industrial spur from switch point to clearance point. Upon the return of the properties to private control, this provision was abandaned and the rule reverted to what was in force and practice just prior to federal control. Much of the dispute before these parties concerns the nature of the construction. Defendant herein insists that the private service track shall be connected to the main track at each end for operating convenience. A considerable percentage of the total cost of such </seg>
            <seg id="p205">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 205 construction is in the special work of the switches and turn-outs. The demand of defendant doubles the cost of this special work from what it would be if the industry track had a dead-end. Instances are presented of record where the carrier has insisted that private industry tracks shall be tied to the m,ain track, or public switch track at each end as a matter of operating economy. Defendant alleges that it has adopted a settled policy of so re - quiring construction whenever feasible. Counsel contends that the carrier is required by law to operate at the greatest economy and is justified in requiring shippers with whom it deals to aid in bringing this desirable result to pass. However, the instances cited in Nebraska of private industry tracks with switches and turnouts at each end, have been at places where road haul crews have done the switching and where the industry has been interested in moving the shipments in either direction. In the present instance all sand loaded in cars would reach the main line in one direction only. The state is full of instances where private industry tracks constructed at request of shippers are spur tracks only. It is probably true that the development of this sandpit would all nothing to the tonnage of the carrier and would merely divide business with rival companies in the same territory. However, it does appear that inasmuch as the carrier is also requiring complainant to pay the full cost of this trackage, the demands as to nature of con - struction are unreasonably severe. But this commission is without any power to issue a binding order on the carrier on the matters discussed as the second point of the complaint. It constitutes merely a dispute between complainant and defendant as to the terms on which the private industry track is to be constructed. The legislature has taken from the Commission jurisdiction over such disputes. Section 5318, Statutes of Nebraska of 1922, provides that "'if such person or association shall feel dis - satisfied with or aggrieved by reason of the amount required to be paid or contributed for the construction of said side track or switch, or for the future maintenance thereof, said persons or associations may file their petition in the district court of the proper county in the manner hereinafter provided for compelling the construction and maintenance of side tracks and switches, and have the reasonable - ness of said charges judicially determined upon issues joined as in other civil actions; and the court shall determine the amount, if any, to be paid and the manner of payment, or prescribe such other con - ditions as may be Just and reasonable and decree rendered therein </seg>
            <seg id="p206">206 SEVENTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT may be enforced in any proper and effective manner authorized by law."

Co. 102 Nebr. 492. It follows from what we have said that we must dismiss the first part of the complaint as defined by us as being without merit and the second part of the complaint as being outside the jurisdiction of the Commission. On the question of the amount of charges for the private trackage insisted upon by defendant, complainant must proceed in the district court of the district in which it reside*.

Chit-ago A North Western Railway Company, Defendant Appearances For complainant, R. W. Devoe, attorney For the defendant, W. H. Jones, assistant general freight agent. For intervenors, G. W. Hamilton, assistant general freight agent, Union Pacific Railroad company; F. Montmorency, general freight agent, Chicago Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company. OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: The Moffitt Sand &amp; Gravel Company are miners of sand and gravel with headquarters in Lincoln. They own and operate a mine located on the Burlington between Ashland and South Bend and have recently purchased some land about two milea east of Morse Bluffs on the C. &amp; N. W. Railway Company. Mr| Moffltt appeared for the company and gave testimony that they were seeking to establish and operate a sand and gravel pit at Morse Bluffs for the purpose of being able to increase their output. At the present time they are loading five to ten cars of sand and gravel daily at the South Bend pit. Mr. Moffitt gave in substance the following testimony in support of the complaint. That the main points of consumption for the sand and gravel mined by the complainant are Omaha and Lincoln; that the com - plainant could not meet the competition of other miners of sand on a four cent per cwt. rate as compared to a three cent rate from com - petitors' mines to Omaha and Lincoln; and that in order to secure business from receivers of sand and gravel at Lincoln and Omaha located on the North Western Railway it was necessary for the com - plainant to have a pit located on said railway. In answer to a ques - tion by Chairman Browne, witness Moffitt testified as follows: "Q. You mean you haven't gravel enough? A. We cannot produce enough at one place. And another reason, you have to be on other railroads to get some business. You have to be on the North Western and Union Pacific to get your share of the business." </seg>
            <seg id="p208">208 SEVENTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT The main point stressed by complainant as a reason why the three cent rate should be established from complainant's pit located near Morse Bluffs to Omaha and Lincoln was on account of the rate now in effect over the North Western from Fremont to Lincoln and Omaha. The distance from the Morse Bluffs pff was shown to be approximately the same as from sand pits located on the North Western west of Fremont. Mr. W. H. Jones, assistant general freight agent of the North Western, testified that the C. &amp; N. W. Railway Company did not want to establish the three cent rate from Morse Bluffs to Lincoln and Omaha for the reason that it would extend the zone that was estab - lished from all producing pits in effect at the time the rate was estab - lished on shipments consigned to Omaha and Lincoln; that if the rate was extended so as to take in the pit near Morse Bluffs that It waa only a question of a short time until the company would be requested to extend the rate to take in pits that would be located near Linwood and would have the effect of breaking down the three cent zone terri - tory. The Union Pacific and Burlington Railroad companies inter - vened in this case. Mr. Hamilton in stating the position of the Union Pacific used the following language: k'^r. Hamilton: I want to call your attention that applicatio e been made from points west of Fremont, applications have be&lt; le from Ames, North Bend and Schuyler. Commissioner Taylor: That is applications for the three rent I. Mr. Hamilton: Yes sir. The Union Pacific is not directly involved this movement from Morse Bluffs to Lincoln or Omaha but we are ectly concerned about the adjustment of these same rates in the te. We are simply fearful that if they are to be extended beyond present zone then we will be confronted with the problem of what will do with lesser mileages in the zone. There will be requests ibably for some less than the three cent rate." tMr. Montmorency for the Burlington said that the same situation ild be created on the Burlington if the three cent rate asked in the petition was granted from Morse Bluffs on shipments to coin and Omaha. Conclusions EAt the time the three cent rate was established from the Platte 3T mines to Omaha and Lincoln a general schedule of distance ff rates on carload shipments of sand and gravel was under con- </seg>
            <seg id="p209">209 NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION suit-ration by the Nebraska Commission in a joint conference with shippers and the Interstate Commerce Commission as to a general distance tariff schedule covering sand and gravel to apply on state and interstate shipments. Prior to the time when the government took possession of the railroads of the country un3er its war powers, the carriers under competitive conditions had established the same rate to Omaha and Lincoln from sand pits located on the Platte River, from La Platte on the east to and including Fremont on the west. The basis of the rates for many years was two cents per cwt., later reduced to one and one-half cent per cwt. The mileage scale agreed upon by shippers and approved by this Commission on Nebraska intrastate traffic was the same as ap - proved by the Interstate Commerce Commission on interstate ship - ments, which had as a starting rate four cents per cwt. for any dis - tance fifty miles and less and to this starting rate was added one-half cent for each additional ten mile haul up to 100 miles and one-half cent for each additional fifteen mile haul up to 175 miles and one-half cent for each additional twenty-five mile haul up to and including 300 miles. On account of the large quantity of sand and gravel used in the cities of Omaha and Lincoln, the shippers and carriers agreed that a rate of three cents to these points from all of the producing pits, La Platte to Fremont inclusive, should be established. This agree - ment was recognized by the Commission and the rates were so estab - lished. Sand and gravel are highly competitive commodities. It seems plain to the Commission that the complainant cannot pay a rate of eighty cents per ton on freight in laying down ship - ments from Morse Bluffs to Lincoln and Omaha in competition with other miners of sand and gravel who are able to reach said markets with a freight rate of sixty cents per ton. At the same time the Com - mission recognizes the fact that to arbitrarily extend the three cent zone to other pits simply because the mileage from that pit to Lincoln happens to be approximately the same as from the most distant pit .to either of the two markets would be to adopt a method of making rates that could be extended indefinitely. If we were to extend the three cent rate to Morse Bluffs, there might be no reason why the rate should not be extended to North Bend and possibly to other stations more distant from the cities of Omaha and Lincoln. The complainant has a mileage advantage over pits located at Fremont and other points along the Platte River on all shipment* to North Western stations south and west of Morse Bluffs. No doubt the quantity loading from the Morse Bluffs pit when established would be to the cities of Omaha and Lincoln and In view of the larger quan- </seg>
            <seg id="p210">210 SEVENTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT tity of shipments moving in tbat general tide of sand and gravel traf - fic, the Commission is of the opinion and so finds that a rate one-half cent leu than would be established under the mileage scale from the Morse Bluffs pit of the complainant to Lincoln and Omaha would rep - resent a reasonable adjustment of the rate complained of. This would represent a normal gradation of the three cent rate to points outside the existing zone. An order will be entered in accordance with these findings. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway ommission that the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway Company be and the same is hereby authorized and directed to establish a rate of iree and one-half per cwt. on carload shipments of sand and gravel, minimum weight 90cf c of the marked capacity of the car but not less nan 40,000 pounds, from complainant's pit two miles east of Morse Bluffs to Lincoln and Omaha; the said three and one-half rate to be he maximum rate to all stations located on defendant's line of rail - oad between Morse Bluffs and Lincoln and Omaha. and entered at Lincoln ly, 1924.

Both complaints are against the Union Pacific Railroad company as defendant. Formal Complaint No. 512 shows that complainant owns and operates a sand and gravel pit at Schuyler, Nebraska, located on a spur track branching off from a connecting transfer track between the Union Pacific Railroad company, hereinafter called the Union Pacific, and the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad company, herein - after called the Burlington: that the Union Pacific refuses to place its cars on the sand pit track of the complainant for loading to points on the Burlington and that the Union Pacific refuses to switch Union Pacific cars from said complainant's sand pit to industry and team tracks of the Union Pacific in Schuyler. Formal Complaint No. 513 alleges that complainant is owner ot a sand and gravel pit located at Schuyler, Nebraska; that the complainant sells and ships sand and gravel to purchasers in Lincoln, Omaha and other points in eastern and central Nebraska; that the rates in effect on carload shipments of sand and gravel to Omaha trom mines located at or near Fremont, Valley, Allis, Louisville, South Bend, Ashland and Morse Bluffs are unjustly discriminatory and preferential when compared with the rates in effect on carload shipments of sand and gravel from Schuyler to Lincoln and Omaha; that a rate of three cents per cwt. has been established from the cities mentioned on carload shipments of sand to Lincoln and Omaha .•ml intermediate points while the present rate from Schuyler to Omaha and Lincoln is four and one-half cents per cwt. on carload ship - ments of the same commodity. The Burlington intervened in both complaints and was rep - resented at the hearings. COMPLAINANT Testimony in Formal Complaint No. 512 showed that the sand pit of the complainant is located outside of the city limits of Schuyier; that the sand pit track that serves complainant's pit was built by the Union Pacific Railroad company; that said sand pit tracks connects with the transfer track between the Union Pacific and the Bulington at Schuyler; that Union Pacific cars set at complainant's pit for load - ing to destinations on the Union Pacific are set by a Union Pacific road engine; that cars furnished by the Burlington for loading at complainant's pit to points on the Burlington are set on the transfer track by the Burlington road engine and later placed on complainant's sand pit track by a Union Pacific road engine; that when a car has been loaded for destination on the Union Pacific track the Union Pacific engine takes the car from complainant's sand pit and carries </seg>

DEFENDANT The witness for the defendant testified that the I'nion Pacific does not make a practice of furnishing I'nion Pacific cars to be loaded for destinations on other railroads where the cars are delivered to other carriers at the billing stations; that open top cars are scarce at certain times of the year, particularly in the fall: that open top cars are used extensively for loading coal and other commodities commonly loaded in open top cars for long haul on the I'nion Pacific The Burlington, as intervener, testified that cars of sand loaded at the sand pit between Columbus and Bellwood billed to destinations on the Union Pacific are handled by a road train crew and on a road haul rate from the sand pit to Columbus. Defendant. T'nion Pacific, offered no testimony as to why they had failed and refused to establish a rate for carload shipments of sand or gravel from complainant's sand pit to industry or team tracks on its railroad at Schuyler. COMPLAINANT As to Formal Complaint No. 513. complainant testified that complainant had many times asked the Union Pacific to establish a rate of three cents per cwt. on carload shipments of sand and gravel </seg>
            <seg id="p213">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 213 from Schuyler to Omaha and Lincoln, and that said defendant had refused to establish said three cent rate; that the distance via the Union Pacific from Fremont to Lincoln is 74 miles; that the distance lrom Schuyler to Omaha over the Union Pacific is 67 miles; that the rate on carload shipments of sand and gravel from Schuyler to Omaha and Lincoln is four and one-half per cwt. Complainant offered an exhibit which shows that the average distance from Union Pacific pits at Valley, and Fremont to Omaha is 31 miles; that the average distance to Lincoln is 65 miles; that the average distance from Allis. Louisville. South Bend and Ashland via the Burlington to Omaha was 39 1-3 miles and from the same pits to Lincoln via the Burl - ington was 30 1-3 miles; that the distance from Fremont to Omaha via the Northwestern is 4 2 miles and from Fremont to Lincoln 52 miles. Complainant also offered an exhibit which purports to show the distances and rates in cents per 100 pounds on carload shipments of sand from stations in Illinois and Wisconsin to Chicago. Com - plainant alleges that it cannot sell sand and gravel in Lincoln and Omaha if it is compelled to pay a freight rate in excess of one-half cent per cwt. above the rate paid by competitors located at Fremont and other stations east thereof on the Union Pacific, Burlington, Missouri Pacific and Rock Island railroad companies. DEFENDANT The defendant, the Union Pacific, introduced an exhibit showing the distance tariff rates on carload shipments of sand or gravel in Nebraska as compared to the same rates in Kansas, Iowa, Illinois and i&gt;;irts of Wisconsin. The Burlington as intervener showed that the present three cent rate was established after many conferences be - tween the carriers, miners of sand, and representatives of Omaha and Lincoln; that the average distance from all their mines in the so-called Lincoln-Omaha rone was slightly over thirty miles to Omaha and a little more than forty miles to Lincoln; that the representatives of Omaha and Lincoln contended at that time that they should have a rate something less than three and one-half cents for fifty miles on account of the large tonnage moving from the Platte River pita to said cities of Omaha and Lincoln for a materially less distance than fifty miles, and in consideration of the distances to the two consuming markets, long and short hauls considered together, a rate one-half cent less than the distance scale namely, three cents, was established as a blanket rate at that time; that it is the conten - tion of the Burlington that the zone rate of three cents should not be extended beyond the present boundaries; that to do so would have a tendency to break down the present distance scale basis for rates which are now in effect on carload shipments of sand and gravel on Nebraska intrastate traffic; that the maximum distance for a haul in the zone from -Fremont to Lincoln via the Union Pacific should not be used as a measure of the rate from Schuyler to Omaha. </seg>
            <seg id="p214">214 SEVENTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT CONCLUSIONS We will first consider and dispose of Issues raised in No. 512. At the time of the hearing it was suggested by the defendant and agreed to by the complainant that they would attempt to get to - gether on all of the issues raised in this case and since the hearing we have received a communication from Mr. C. A. Magaw, attorney for the Union Pacific which reads in part as follows: "You will recall that at the hearing of the above matter on September 25, 1924, Mr. Ehernberger complained of tliree things: 1. That the company refused to switch ears of Band from his pit, which is within the Schuyler yard limit, to industries and team tracks in Schuyler. 2. Because the Union Pacific refused to set its cars for loading with shipments for points on the Burlington, and also because it refused to bill its cars when loaded by the complainant to points off of its own lines. 3. Because the Burlington will not move cars of sand until the Union Pacific places them on the transfer track, which prac - tice the complainant says results in great delay as the Kurlington train leaves Schuyler in the morning and the Union Pacific switching is not done until after the Burlington train has gone. The complainant contends that the Burlington should take the cars from the spur track at the pit instead of waiting for the Union Pacific to set them on the transfer. You will also recall that at the conclusion of the hearing. Mr. Lane stated that in view of the fact that the complainant's sand pit is not accessible to trucks or teams, the Union Pacific is willing to publish a tariff providing for switching cars of sand from the pit to industries in Srhuyler for $6.3U, with the under - standing, however, that this does not apply to switching cars to the team track, and Mr. Lane stated that the defendant could not consent that this be done. The complainant accepted this proposition and this feature ot the complaint, as I understand it was disposed of on that basis. The other two matters complained of you will recall were submitted to the Commission with the understanding, however, that the parties should endeavor to adjust them within a rea - sonable time. General Manager Jeffers advises that the Union Pacific will switch sand and gravel to industries within defined yard limits at Schuyler at a rate of $6.30 per car. as published in Item 2340, Union Pacific tariff 105-D. LWith respect to items 2 and 3 referred to above, Mr. Jeffer ises as follows: "As to Item No. 2: It is distinctly the duty of the Burling - ton, under A. R. A. car service rules, to furnish cars to be loaded for movement via the Burlington. This appears to cover the situation fully, and if the Burlington will deliver the cars to us before 8:00 a. m., we will have them spotted for loading with our local freight train about 9:00 a. m. each day except Sunday. </seg>
            <seg id="p215">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 215 As to Item No. 3: We will arrange to switch the sand pit daily except Sunday, about 9:00 a. m. delivering the cars then loaded and ready to the Burlington in time to leave on their freight train, which is due to leave at 2:45 p. m. This will provide them with daily service, except Sunday, (or traffic destined to Burlington points, which is reasonable service and should be satisfactory. We do not see the necessity of opening our industries to our competitors by allowing them access to our rails. We feel that the above service is ample and equitable, and hope that it will prove satisfactory to the Commission. Mr. Ehernberger of the Sand Company seems satisfied with the arrangement." As to items one and three quoted above we will not enter an order at this time but will hold the matter in abeyance until a tariff has been presented for the Commission's approval as to item number one and advice that the operating program has been put into effect as suggested by Mr. Jeffers with regard to item number three. As to item number two quoted above the situation cited by the complainant as to carload shipments of sand originating on the Burlington at the mine located four or five miles south of Columbus, consigned to points on the Union Pacific is not analogous with the situation at Schuyler. The mere fact that the Burlington has established a per car rate for the handling of sand or gravel between the pit on its line near Columbus to Columbus is not substantially different than the loading of a car on its line of railroad at any station south of Columbus consigned to points on the Union Pacific Railroad. Mr. Jeffers has correctly stated the car service rules as established by the American Railway Association and we do not think we would be justified in this case in requiring the Union Pacific to furnish its open top cars for loading of sand or gravel to points on the Burlington billed from Schuyler. The rules governing the handling of equipment as between carriers universally provides that cars set to be loaded on the rails of a switching carrier to be turned over to a connecting line at the loading point shall be furnished by the road haul road. We do not think that the testimony in this case justified us in finding that a different rule should be applied to the complainant's situation at Schuyler. As to Formal Complaint No. 513 complainant offered testimony purporting to show the rates in effect on carload shipments of sand and gravel from points in Wisconsin and Illinois to Chicago apparently contending that because a three and one-fourth cent rate is in effect from points in Wisconsin to Chicago, a three cent rate should be ordered by the Commission in this case. Comparison of rates without showing the transportation conditions surrounding the handling of </seg>
            <seg id="p216">216 the traffic is of very little assistance to the Commission in finding a reasonable rate between points in Nebraska. In Moffitt Sand Company v. the Chicago &amp; North Western, Formal Complaint No. 508 (17 N. S. R. C.) we discussed at length the question of extending the limits of the so-called Lincoln-Omaha zone on carload shipments of sand or gravel from Platte River pits. There has been no new testimony brought to the attention of the Commis- C&gt;n in this case that would justify us in making a different finding an was entered in that case. In that case we found that the com - j-lainant was entitled to something less than the distance tariff scale on carload shipments of sand and gravel from Morse Bluffs to Lincoln and Omaha on account of the volume of tonnage of said commodity - moving into the two cities. We found that the defendant should establish rates from Morse Bluffs to Omaha and Lincoln of three and one-half cents per cwt. The distance from Schuyler to Lincoln via the Burlington is 74 miles and under the present distance tariff scale the rate is five cents per cwt. The distance from Schuyler to Omaha via Um I'nion Meific is 66 miles and the rate is four and one-half cents. In dis - posing of this case we are of the opinion that the same consideration hould be given the complainant in this case that was used in dis- posing of Formal Complaint No. "&gt;»!&gt; supra, i. e. that one-half cent per cwt. should be deducted from the distance tariff scale in find - ng the rate from Schuyler to Lincoln and Omaha. We are of the opinion and so find that the defendant, I'nion Pacific, should be equired to establish a rate of four cents per cwt. on carload ship - ments of sand or gravel from .Schuyler to Omaha and that the Burlington should establish a rate of four and one-half cents per wt. on carload shipments of sand or gravel from Schuyler to Lincoln nd that the rate so established should act as a maximum at all ntermediate stations where the distance tariff scale does not establish lower rate. Case No. 512 will be continued on the Commission's docket. Within thirty days from the date of this order the defendant will file with the Commission, copy of any agreement that they have been ble to effect as between the complainant and the defendant and the matter will be given further consideration and disposed of as the acts warrant. An order will be entered in accordance with these ndings.

For defendant, Wymer Dressier, attorney. OPINION AND FINDING RANDALL, Commissioner: Hearing on this complaint was held in the Tri-County Community Club building at Newman Grove, Madison county, Nebraska, on October 10, 1924. The complaint was based on the claim that there was not an adequate amount of help to transact the business at the depot for the accommodation of the public. There was a large amount of testi - mony offered by the complainants to show that owing to the helper, t clerk, having been taken away from the depot by the company, t the office in the depot had to be closed whenever the agent was of the office and that no one was left in the depot to transact the </seg>
            <seg id="p218">218 SEVENTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT business of delivering telegraph messages, less than carload freight and express to the general public. The agent's hours were from 7 a. m. until 3 p. m. and the operator-clerk's hours were from 11:30 a. m. to 7:30 p. m. This would leave only one man at the depot from 7 a. m. until 11:30 a. m. and from 3 p. m. until 7:30 p. m. Testimony showed that the principal trouble was the agent's absence from the office in the checking of the freight from freight train No. 565, when No. 583 was late in arriving and departing from the station. Freight train No. 565 is scheduled to arrive at Newman Grove at 1:45 p. m. This is the train that brings in the less than carload freight from the east of which there is quite a volume to be checked, both on the platform for delivery to the drayman and in the set-out. It was shown by testi - mony that it was the practice of the draymen to deliver the freight checked out on the platform immediately after being checked out from the train and when the train arrived early enough the freight was taken from the set-out, hut that required that the agent should check that freight to the drayman and if the train arrived late the agent was required to lock the office in the depot and go up to the car and spend from three-fourths of an hour to as much as two hours in check - ing out the less than carload freight from the set-out to the drayman. During this time there would be no one in the office to send telegrams, receive orders for cars, deliver less than carload freight or sell tickets. If No. 565 would arrive at the station on scheduled time there would be two men on duty to attend to the business at that hour and until 3 p. m. A careful checking of train No. 565, by an exhibit offered by the defendant railroad company, shows that this train No. 565 did not arrive at Newman Grove on scheduled time during the months of August, September and for nine days in October, and that more than one-fourth of the time it arrived after the agent had gone off duty and no one but the operator-clerk was on duty, so that it was necessary to close up the office If the freight was checked from that car by the operator-clerk that afternoon. If the train arrived too late for the set-ont to be checked on the same afternoon that it arrived, then it would have to be checked the following morning by the agent before the operator-clerk went on duty and the same condition would attain. There being only one man on duty the office would have to be locked and the agent would be in the set-out checking out freight so that there would be no one In the office to serve the public in any capacity daring the time that the agent was in the set-out checking the freight to the drayman. If it were practical and possible for the railroad com - pany to get No. 565 in on scheduled time, the Commission is of the opinion from the testimony that there is sufficient help employed to look after the business at the station. But as It is impossible for freight trains to be run on scheduled time owing to conditions which the defendant company cannot control, it would seem that it would be necessary for the railroad company to either advance the running time of train No. 565 so that there wuold be two men on duty at the </seg>

From the exhibit presented by the defendant company it is apparent that at least three-fourths of the time. It would be necessary for the hours of the agent to be increased from eight hours to nine and in some instances ten. providing that the freight was to be checked out and un - loaded from the set-out on the day of the arrival of the train. It would seem ijuite important, if it is possible, that the set-out should be unload - ed on the afternoon of its arrival owing to the fact that the agent has no assistance from seven o'clock in the morning until 11:30; that it the set-out is left over to be unloaded in the forenoon before the operator - clerk goes on duty at 11:30, the office in the depot would be locked during the entire time that the agent is checking the set-out, but if It ould be checked and unloaded in the afternoon on its arrival, then perator-clerk, or agent, whichever the case might be, would be the depot office to look after the business of the public. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission, that, effective November 21, 1924, the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway company extend the time of the agent's hours in the afternoon, sufficiently to check the set-out freight received on train No. 565, provided the train is reported to arrive in sufficient time for &gt;mpletion of checking the set-out, so that the time of the agent is not required for a longer period than ten hours. In case train No. 56 5 is reported to the agent so that it will be too late for the completing of the unloading of the set-out by five p. m. of the day of its arrival, then in that case the agent's time need not be extended but the company shall be required to have the operator-clerk go on duty at 9:30 the following morning, so that during the check of the less than carload freight in the set-out, the depot office will be oc - cupied by either the agent or the operator-clerk for the accommoda - tion of the public.

Cow-gill, Councilman and Superintendent of Streets and Public Improvements, City of Lincoln, Nebraska, Complainant, v. Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway Company, Defendant OPINION AND KINMXt; BROWNE, Chairman This complaint involves the leasehold of certain right-of-way of defendant company adjacent to lots 18, 19 and 20, block 1. Houtz place, city of Lincoln, being specifically located on the east aide of the main line and industry track of defendant company lying between Twenty-sixth and Twenty-seventh streets and between Randolph and E streets. Complainant, commissioner of the city of Lincoln, desires to lease 80 feet of the Rock Island right-of-way lying to the east of th^ in - dustry track in the location named above. That segment of right-of - way is now under lease and actively occupied by another industry. Defendant does not desire to change lessees. Complainant chiefly contends that inasmuch as the Rock Island eases right-of-way to other industries in the same line of work as the tepartment of streets and public improvements of the city of Lincoln and refuses the above mentioned lease to complainant, a discrimination 8 created which is contrary to the provisions of the Railway Com - mission Act of the state of Nebraska, and on this ground the Commis - ion is asked to exercise a jurisdiction alleged to exist. Complainant ;eenly presses the further contention that the owner of adjacent property has a prior right over all others to lease upon equitable terms rights-of-way segments from railway companies for purpose of secur- cur- ing access to switching facilities For answer the Rock Island alleges that it has sole control over he leasing of its right-of-way to private or public parties and that the Commission is without jurisdiction to pass on this complaint. It s further alleged that the land in question is now occupied under ease which has not expired, which lessee is using in a manner not detrimental to lessor and that it does not desire to terminate the lease. One further point was injected into the case in testimony. It was conceded that the city of Lincoln has not yet determined that it would use the leasehold for purposes of unloading material if it was n possession of an adequate lease.

The interpretation of existing law made by the Com - mission in these cases has not been measured by the courts, but the Commission has not gone so far as to declare that it has jurisdiction to require a railroad to cancel a lease already In existence to one shipper actively using it, and the giving of the lease to another. The contention of complainant as to priority right of the owner of adjacent private lands, is new. We do not think it is good law. It would upset existing business widely. Probably not half the lessees railroad right-of-way in this state own lands immediately adjacent to the right-of-way. If the rule were good, investments in permanent and semi-permanent structures on such leaseholds would be in con - stant jeopardy. Complainant alleges discrimination in that others in like business njoy switching facilities he cannot get. Defendant offers leases adjacent to switch track but complainant says such tracts are not well located for the city's paving repair work. Complainant admits that there are apparently no suitable locations in the section of the city which he desires to occupy, except the particular location. Complain - ant still has by law the right to service from a private industry track to private grounds owned by the city. Complainant points out that must of such locations are unavailable because of the unsightly nature of the business which would be conducted by him. This combination ot circumstances presents a complication, unfortunate for the de - partment of streets and public improvements of this city. It does not produce discrimination forbidden by law. Defendant has by the provisions of this lease the right to cancel all, or any part, of any lease on proper notice. The Commission's power falls short of what is asked in the complaint even if it were persuaded the order desired were equitable. It follows that we should dismiss the complaint. </seg>

Great Western Com - mission Company, Interstate Live Stock Company; and the Commission's own motion v. The Chicago. St. Paul. Minneapolis &amp; Omaha Railway Company and Union Stock Yards Company. OPINION AND FINDING RANDALL, Commissioner: The complaint was based upon the arrival of livestock fr Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha Railway company north Omaha yards to the Union Stock Yards and the delay in unloading of the stock after arriving at the stock yards, which was causing unnecessary loss and shrinkage to the livestock that was handled by he Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha Railway company and by them turned over to the Missouri Pacific under a switching arrange - ment that has been in existence between these two companies for a number of years. Hearing was held at the Omaha Live Stock Exchange Building on April 4, 1924, before Commissioner Randall, all parties o the complaint appearing except the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis * Omaha Railway company. A large amount of testimony was taken rom the complainants and the secretary of the Omaha Live Stock Exchange and some of the commission firms who do business at the South Omaha Live Stock Exchange. It was clearly shown by the un - lisputed testimony of the witness that an unreasonable amount of </seg>

In order that the Commission might have an authentic checking on the time of the arrival of the stock at the north Omaha yards, the Chicago. St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha Railway company were requested to furnish a detailed report of the time of the arrival of their stock at the north Omaha yards, the time of delivery of the same to the Missouri Pacific Railroad company. The Missouri Pacific Railroad company furnished a detailed report of the time of the delivery of the stock to their road by the Chicago, St. Paul, Minne - apolis &amp; Omaha, the time of departure from the north Omaha yard and the time of delivery to the Stock Yards railroad. The Stock Yards company furnished a detailed report of the time of the delivery of the stock to their tracks at South Omaha and also the time set at the chute. These exhibits have all been carefully checked by the Commission and it is found that in a great many instances an exces - sive amount of time has been consumed in the delivery of this stock from the north Omaha yards to the chutes, and in some instances an excessive amount of time has been consumed after delivery at the south Omaha yards before the stock has been placed at the chutes and unloaded to the detriment of the shippers on the Chicago, St. Paul. Minneapolis &amp; Omaha Line. After carefully considering the checking the Commission is of the opinion that one cause for the excessive time consumed by the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis A Omaha in delivering the stock to the Missouri Pacific is the holding up of the stock and the delivery of the bills of early arrival trains until later arrival trains arrive before turning the bills over to the Missouri Pacific Railroad company and then the Missouri Pacific Railroad company neglecting to make prompt delivery of the stock after it Is turned over to them by the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha Railway until the last trains arrive on the Chicago, St. Paul, Minne - apolis &amp; Omaha Railway so that the delivery can be made by one trip of the switch engine from the north Omaha yards to the south Omaha yards. During this time the stock that has been delivered to the north Omaha yards by the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis ft Omaha Railway company is standing on a side track, in some instances many hours, awaiting the transfer by the Missouri Pacific to the south Omaha yards and during all that time the stock is subject to agitation by switch engines passing backwards and forwards, caus - ing the stock to become nervous, and in warm weather in the sum - mer and cold weather in the winter, the stock shrink, and shrinkage </seg>
            <seg id="p224">224 ta large factor in the weight of the stock when finally delivered to e market. The further delay has been found between the deliveries of the tock by the M. &amp; 0. to the Missouri Pacific by reason, as we said before, of the Missouri Pacific holding up the stock at that point and they could get a larger load to haul. By this delay the .Missouri 'acific deliver this stock at the south Omaha yards alter the other roads entering that market have congested the unloading chute racks to such an extent that the stock has to stand on the side track awaiting its turn at the chutes, which makes another delay and the tock yards are unable to move this stock to the unloading chutes and unload it until after the chute tracks are cleared of the empties hat have been unloaded from other roads, it was clearly shown by the statement of Mr. Schellberg, general manager of the stock yards, that if this stock was moved promptly from the north Omaha yards to the south Omaha stock yards tracks, upon its arrival at north Omaha, that it would arrive in most instances at the south Omaha yards before the congested' condition existed and the stock would be unloaded promptly and he out of the way before the heavy arrivals of stock on the other roads and would obviate these Ions &lt;lela&gt;- that are now brought about by the practice of the Missouri Pacific in not delivering the stock from the north Omaha yards promptly upon it. - arrival at the north Omaha yards. While it is probably not practii - able for the Missouri Pacific to be required to move a small number of cars of stock immediately upon their arrival at north Omaha, yet. n many instances, the checking shows that as high as ten. twelve and fifteen carloads have stood upon the side track in the north Omaha yards awaiting the arrival of other trains so that the stork could all be delivered on one haul. This, in our judgment, is an unfair and bad practice and ought not to be followed by the Missouri Pacific in the delivery of this stock. The Commission is not advised of the switching arrangements hat the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha Railway company have with the Missouri Pacific in the delivery of this stock but i; is he duty of the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha Railway ompany to make arrangements with t. e Missouri Pacitic Railroad ompany to deliver this stock promptly at the south Omaha Yards as oon as the bills are delivered to them. And it is the duty of the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha Railway company to deliver hese bills to the Missouri Pacific Railroad company as soon as the tock arrives at the north Omaha yards. It is also the duty of the nion Stock Yards company to place this stock at the chute and unload it without delay other than the natural time that it would ake to move and unload this stock upon its arrival at the stock yards railroad. If this is done all cause for reasonable complaint by </seg>

The complaints concerned in this hearing are only a fair sample of continuous complaints that have been made to the Commission for some time past and unless the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha Railway company can make arrangements with the Missouri Pacific Railroad company to do their switching more promptly they will be required to make arrangements to get into the south Omaha stock yards from their line in some other way that will obviate these delays. Chapter 2, article V, section 144, of the Revised Statutes of Ne braska for 1922, reads as follows: "Handling stock at yards. Every stock yard shall handle, unload and yard all cars of livestock, arriving between the hours of 6 o'clock a. m. and 6 o'clock p. m. and deliver into yards used by commission company, when so requested, within two hours after the final delivery of the same at the tracks of said stock yards by the connecting railroad, except in cases of un - avoidable delay or unusual circumstances. For each half hour's delay in handling and unloading livestock beyond the period prescribed herein any such stock yard shall forfeit and pay to the shipper of said livestock or his agent, as demurrage, within twenty-four hours after unloading said livestock, the sum of five dollars for each car of livestock so delayed. Said payment to be made by mailing draft or certified check to agent, or owner: Provided, if any part of the forfeitures described in this section shall be collected by a suit at law, an attorney's fee of five dollars per car shall be allowed the plaintiff by the court, but not exceeding fifteen dollars on any one shipment."

            <seg id="p227">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 227 fendant. on January 16. changed the schedule of service on its West Lawn stub line, operating between 48th and Leavenworth and 58th and Center. The changes taking place on that date were the elimination of the headway of ten minutes and the substitution therefor of twenty - minute headway between 9:16 a. m. and 3:05 p. in., and between 7:16 p. m. and 12:36 p. m. Complaint was lodged with the Commission as a result of this change and hearing was had at Omaha. The new schedule was not suspended because the Commission wanted the op - portunity to study the effect on traffic under the new schedules. After the construction of the line about twelve years ago the company gave twenty-minute service until September, 1920, when ten-minute service was inaugurated by the use of two one-man cars. This stub line is in a developing territory. It serves a suburban center of population at 58th and Center and an intermediate territory only Minifwhat developed. Complainants alleged that reduction of service in the period of light demand injures the development of the territory. Defendant alleged that they had put on the ten-minute service on the theory that they would thereby develop a traffic that was using other means of conveyance and that they had been disappointed in the results. Car mile earnings, based on the collections on this line, have been for the last several years as follows: 1918 9.32 cents 1921 8.76 cents 1919 12.28 cents 1922 9.06 cents 1920 12.08 cents 1923 9.13 cents The average earnings for the last week in January, under the re - duced service, were 13.06 cents per car mile. The record indicates that there has been no falling off of patronage since the reduction of service in a portion of each day. It would therefore appear that no one is prevented from riding and the chief point of objection is the inconvenience of waiting a longer period and effect on values of real estate of lessened service. The complainants are in error that "an implied promise" of service constitutes a vested right. The duty of a street railway company in law is to serve adequately the people it sets out to serve, provided, always, it secures fair compensation. This compensation does not necessarily have to measure out on any particular portion of its system. We have, however, been unable to see wherein the serious disad - vantage occurs in a schedule which gives eight and ten-minute fre - quency of service when the demand is heavy and reduces that iervlce </seg>
            <seg id="p228">228 Em the demand is light. This frequent service is for more than seven rs each day. On the contrary we consider the move in the right ction. This company has been steadily losing traffic since 1921. approaches the time when it must either perfect additional lomies, or secure greater revenues if the traffic will stand the strain.

OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Chairman Citizens of the city of Omaha filed complaint with this Commis - ion asking that it exercise its regulatory powers over defendant com - any to such an extent as to require it to construct an extension of rackage on Thirtieth Street between Spaulding and Fort Streets in rder that the Florence line might be connected up directly with the ne extending north on Thirtieth Street from Lake Street, thereby giv - ng to the intervening territory quicker service to the high school ocated on Ames Avenue. </seg>
            <seg id="p229">NEBRASKA STATE KAIL WAY COMMISSION 229 Supplemental to this complaint the Fontenelle Improvement club through its officers asked that the Commission consider the neces - sities of a large section of Omaha and require the defendant street railway company to construct from Thirty-third and Parker Streets north to Lake Street, thence west on Lake Street to Fortieth Street and north on Fortieth Street to the intersection with the present track* located on Ames Avenue. The proposed trackage outlined in the com - plaint of the improvement club would constitute an extension of ap - proximately two miles in length and would practically bisect an are* more than one mile square in which are located no street railway lines. This second complaint was made a part of the original complaint although it was filed after the hearing took place on said original com - plaint. No opportunity has yet been presented to either company or defendant improvement club to present the facts. For answer the company alleged: (a) That the Commission has not the jurisdiction to require ex - tensions of trackage as a part of its powers of supervising service; (b) That the city challenges the right of the company to occupy any streets not now containing street railway trackage, which question must be determined by exhaustive suit at law before the company can be assured of the correctness of its position that it has a perpetual franchise on all streets; (c) That so far as the Thirtieth Street extension Is concerned, the territory is now reasonably served, schools readily reached, and pupils, whose need was stressed in the complaint, not paying orfl of pocket expense of carrying them; (d) That such extension would add no revenue; and (e) That earnings of the company on such trackage as it now has have been so meager during the past several years as to make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, for defendant to borrow money with which to construct the additions prayed for. The position of the city of Omaha as stated by the counsel was: (a) The street railway company has rights on such streets as It is now occupying until the year 1928 and has no rights on any other street within the municipal limits of Omaha; (b) That the dispute as to this question has not been adjudicated and until such determination, the city council does not desire to con- </seg>
            <seg id="p230">230 i*j Y Ij -^ 1 r*- f*-* &gt;N X xi \*s -t-^ ** C* X^ V^x\ A •ent to any occupancy of the streets which might in any manner act as an estoppel; (c) That the policy of the city for several years past has been to issue permits for opening pavement with full liability upon the street railway company to be ordered off any such street at any time the city might desire; (d) That the city council cannot authorize the occupancy by the street railway company of any of the streets mentioned in the two complaints, such authorization being reserved by charter to the people of Omaha; (e) That under the present provisions of the charter the peopl themselves cannot authorize any extensive franchise grants at on election ; (f) That if the street railway company were to build at this time on any of the streets involved in the complaint it would do so entirely at its own risk of ejectment at any moment Complainants did not appear at the hearing. This default in ap pearance would not warrant the Commission in refusing to proceec with a careful investigation of the transportation necessities brough to its attention in the complaint. However, it must appear from the pleadings and argument of counsel that our first interest is to determine whether we have the power to order relief and if such question can be answered affirm - atively, then to investigate the extent of the relief which may equitably be required. The city of Omaha has sole control over the use of its streets by those who do not have the inherent right to use such thoroughfares. The street railway company must seek permit from the people of Omaha for use of the streets. The service given after such permit has been exercised is under the supervision of the Commission. We can authorize abandonment of service for proper reasons where the fran - chise permits the continuance of service, but we do not have the power to require service where the franchise does not permit location of physical properties. If the position of the city is sound legally, the company could not comply with an order of the commission to construct extensions. This would be a proper test of the reasonableness of such an order. Until the question of the franchise is settled, an order such as is prayed tor would only be the ground work for a suit at law with the Commission </seg>
            <seg id="p231">231 NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION taking one side of the case. The city does not desire that we inject ourselves into the law suit that is pending. It is neither the duty nor the privilege of the Commission to pass on franchise questions — 96 Atl. 1013; 242 S. W. 550. We may proceed a step further. If the city were to withdraw its hostility to street railway extensions within Omaha at this time, with - out there having been finally determined the franchise dispute, we could hardly equitably require the company to expend some two hun - dred thousand dollars in the construction of extensions which invest - ment might soon be rendered junk by an enforclble order to vacate the streets. Funds for construction must be secured from outside in - vestors, none of whom desire to invest in a doubtful suit at law. These being our conclusions, it was unnecessary for us to set the cases down for hearings as to the facts. The wide scope of territory in northwest Omaha not tapped by street railway lines would seem to be prima facie evidence of certain transporation necessities. It is un - fortunate that the citizens who have appealed to this Commission should be surrounded by this franchise dispute. It is well within the power of the citizens of the metropolis backed by general popular de - mand to secure an early determination of that dispute. When we can legally and equitably do so, this Commission will make a very careful investigation of the situations complained of in both complaints to the end that such additional transportation as necessity requires shall be furnished by the company which has undertaken to furnish In an ex - clusive manner the public transportation service of the city. The com - plaints will be dismissed without prejudice to their renewal. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the complaints of W. J. Norman et al. and the Fontenelle Improvement club against the Omaha and Council Bluffs Street Railway company praying for extension of street railway lines within the city of Omaha be and they hereby are dismissed without prejudice.

FINDING ON REHEARING ON MOTION TO AMEND ORIGINAL CONCLUSIONS BROWNE, Chairman: Original order herein dated September 26, 1923, 16 N. S. R. C. S4-24 3, set forth fully the history of this case up to that date. Ex - eptions to the findings there made were tiled November 19, 1923, and briefs were received from applicant and from the city of Omaha, espondent, on February IS. 19 24. No additional testimony was taken. Arguments were heard on February 18 and 19, 1924, and the case esubmitted. The contents of applicant's motion to amend the find - ngs are summarized by the corporation counsel of the city of Omaha as follows: "(a) Relating to exclusion or reduction of items of cost or value in the opinion said to result from: first, misapprehension of the evi - dence; second, misconception of correct theories, and use of incorrect U"(b) Relating to standards for measuring values: first, incor t standards; second, refusal to use correct standards. "(c) Failure to enlarge tangible rate base in consideration of intangible element claimed as going value. "(d) Improper and unfair disposition of important but miscel - laneous considerations intimated as consequences of unfriendly at - titude to the applicant, or biased views favorable to the efforts of the Commission's organization. " We do not understand that applicant alleged an unfriendly at - titude on the part of the Commission but it did stress that the Com - mission gave too much weight to the testimony of its own organization. UThe exception! are listed under eleven major headings which y briefly be set forth as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p233">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 233 (1) The Commission should have eliminated no real estate from the property used and useful and should have allowed engineering on the acquisition of the real estate. (2) The Commission should not have rejected any buildings listed in the inventory as not used and useful and it should not bare disapproved the addition by the company of certain amounts to rep - resent contractors' profits and contingencies In reaching 1U con - clusions as to fair value of structures. (3) All the Commission's criticisms of the methods used by the company in arriving at conclusions as to value of track and roadway and rejections from those conclusions of certain items by the Com - mission were wrong and the original testimony should have been re - ceived without change. (4) Some detail relating to (3), above ( 5 ) The refusal of the Commission to accept as a factor In arriv - ing at fair value of the properties assumed contractors' profits in the theoretical reconstruction of the electric distribution system was in error. (6) Purchase expense on the figured reproduction cost of power equipment should have been allowed in full. (7) The Commission should have considered all car equipment listed in the Inventory as used and useful. (8) Working capital including materials and supplies should have been at least $862,000 in place of 1400,000. (9) The rejection in part of certain general or overhead ex - pense In the company's computations in arriving at conclusions as to fair value of electric distributing system, car equipment, shops, and car house equipment was in error and these items should be reinstated. (10) The Commission allowed nothing for going value whereas going value is obviously a factor in the fair value of this plant. (11) To the extent that the Commission reject any of the assets of this company as going to make up fair value it should list the items specifically. The objections were elaborately briefed and fully argued. Care - ful and repeated analysis of the printed brief has not been sufficient to remove contusion engendered by the argument. Either the reasoning </seg>
            <seg id="p234">234 SEVENTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT and the computations in the original opinion were not clearly Bet forth or they were not fully comprehended by counsel. The plan of the Commission in reaching its conclusions as to air value was to take the three major methods presented in testi - mony, namely — reproduction cost at the moment, reproduction at four ear average prices, and original cost of the property existing and named in the inventory as the record showed they were experienced, and to carry these three methods through to the end of the analysis, iach of the three methods presented in testimony was carefully measured in the light of that testimony and criticisms applied without n any degree attempting to reject any of the three plans. It was ecognized that all presented valuable data from which conclusions as to fair value were to be reached. When the Commission had ex - ercised its best judgment on each of the plans and hud varied the omputations to meet the criticisms it took the liberty to make, it hen applied the reasonable judgment required by law and reached conclusions as to fair value. The Commission did not find three differ - ent fair values and from them reach a composite and final figure. It is urged that if the Commission was to consider original cost of the properties as a factor in arriving at fair value, considerable pre - judice was shown in giving weight to the testimony of the Commis - sion's engineer on that subject, while rejecting the testimony of the company on the same point. The criticism, after careful review of f the facts, does not seem to have any warrant It should be clear from the record that Mr. Powell for the com tny and Mr. Forbes for the Commission did not undertake to do the me thing and hence no comparison can be made of the testimony of these two witnesses. Mr. Powell dealt with the plant account us it appeared on the company's ledger. He paid no attention it tailed inventory of property in existence at the beginning of this in - vestigation. He had to assume that the plant accounts included all the property now in existence and none of the property that had dis- appeared, although such an assumption was not warranted by the facts later developed. Mr. Forbes paid no attention to the ledger account of plant. He dealt with the inventory presented by the company which was ac - cepted as substantially correct. He isolated the items in the in - ventory and then sought from the underlying records such as con - tracts and job orders, to ascertain what the items actually cost. To he extent of approximately 80 per cent of the property he found that underlying data. To it he added certain amounts for overhead ex - penses, which additions have not been challenged by applicant as in - correct under the method pursued by witness Forbes, except in so far as they were not liberal enough. </seg>
            <seg id="p235">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 235 It was entirely consistent as far as comparisons were concerned to have rejected the testimony of Mr. Powell and to have accepted that Mr. Forbes In dealing with the specific exceptions we will not take them up as presented because the principles underlying the action of the Commis - sion on several such exceptions were identical and the exceptions can be grouped. ENGINEERING: — For this particular overhead the company claimed on the four-year average computations $762,560 of value and considerably more than that on the computations designated "1919 prices." For reasons set forth in great detail in the original order the Commission reduced this figure $238,650. The Commission's witness Mr. Forbes, followed the general plan of the company by using an arbitrary to cover this overhead. Nothing in the records of the com - pany furnish any basis for comparison, as on the whole the engineering was done within the organization, was paid for as current operating • ■xiiense. and was never reflected in plant accounts. On careful review we conclude that the amount allowed for engineering in the valuation was sufficiently liberal. As it reflected in the final conclusions on fair value, engineering represented approximately half a million dollars value. CONTRACTORS' PROFITS: — Objection to the manner in which the Commission handled this item appears several times in the ex - ceptions and much attention is devoted to it in the brief. The differ - ence between the reasoning of the Commission and that of the com - pany is fundamental. The position of the company is that hypothesis and actual fact must not be overlapped and that if its plan contem - plates a theoretical reconstruction so rapidly to be done as to call for letting of extensive contracts, that plan must not be confounded with the actual experience of the company. If the company is correct then the Commission has unjustly reduced the computations, not in the amount stated in the brief wherein are repetitions and error of figures, but in an amount approximating $400,000. This observation relates only to applicant's computations, as whatever contractors' profits were experienced are included In the figures presented by the Commission's engineering department. The Commission stated that contractors' profits appearing In applicant's computations of value of buildings amounted to $230,000 under one basis and $268,000 under the other basis of figuring. For reasons fully assigned these figures were reduced in dealing with the computations, $100,000 under the one plan and $115,000 under the other plan. The company challenged the accuracy of the figures u well as the principles applied and alleged that the total effect of con - tractors' profits assumed on buildings was approximately $125,000 </seg>
            <seg id="p236">236 nder one plan and $151,000 under the other. Whether this criticism correct depends upon interpretations placed upon the testimony of te company's valuator. It is not necessary to determine the issue he company's organisation did not, and does not, include facilities or construction of extensive buildings. Such structures by public tilities, are ordinarily done under contract and where there are con - tracts there must be contractors' profits. No hypothesis contrary to rdlnary experience exists in assuming the buildings constructed by on tract. We will reverse our previous conclusions in this respect and estore to the computations of the company $100,000 on one plan and 1115,000 on the other in order that these sums may play as much art as other sums used by the company in its computations in the nal determination of fair value. As to contractors' profits appearing in computations on other classifications of property, we adhere to our previous conclusions. STORE AND YARD EXPENSE: — The company's four year claim for this loading item was $237,000 in round figures. The claim for the 1919 computations was considerably larger. The Commission for reasons assigned reduced the above figure $88,600 which included the full amount of the loading on the property rejected as not used and useful. It added over $25,000 to the figures used by the Commis - sion's witness. In support of its exception to the handling of these Eding items the company insists that it was fully correct. Nothing presented on brief and in argument to warrant a change of con - sions arrived at in the original finding. CONTINGENCIES: — Under this heading the company added to its computations on the four-year basis about $146,000 and a relatively larger amount in its 1919 computations. The Commission reduced the amount carried in the four-year computations by $41,000 and added to the computations of its own witness on account of this head - ing $32,500. While exception is taken to the manner in which the Commission handled this subject, very little support is presented for the exception. The previous conclusion will not be disturbed. SHOP EXPENSE: — The Commission made reductions on account of this heading in all the computations. The item was used chiefly in figures on value of cars. The action of the Commission in making reductions related chiefly to the depreciation factor. It is fully dis - ussed in the original opinion and the reasons there assigned are not attached by the company in any sustained manner in support of the exceptions. Indeed if the Commission were to accept the repeated claim on brief that there is and should be no depreciation of this com - pany's properties, it would have still further reduced the amount of theoretical shop expense added to the computations. </seg>
            <seg id="p237">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 237 PROPERTY NOT USED AND USEFUL:— The Commission re - jected as not used and useful property carried in the computations of tbe company at the undepreciated figure of $513,000 and $614,000 respectively, and in the computations of the Commission's witness at 1166,000. This was entirely composed of certain real estate and cer - tain rolling stock. It was admitted that this property has value and represents assets. The company predicated its chief objection In this respect upon a view point which the Commission had not taken. This is stated on page 5 of the brief as follows: "There Is more involved in this case than mere rate-making. There is the ascertainment of value of the company's property. The refinancing of property is as essential to the company's exist - ence as is rate-making, as will more fully appear In the brief in support hereof." The Commission concurs with the company fully in the statement that the refinancing is tremendously Important both to the city of Omaha and to the owners of the property. But if the history of this case is kept clearly In mind it will be seen that it is a rate case and only a rate case. Fair value for the rate making purposes must consist only of property used and useful although there may be much other property Important in refinancing. The company asked that to the extent that any property is omitted finally, that it be listed in the supplemental opinion in detail. We will deal later with this request. WORKING CAPITAL: — The reasoning of the Commission in ar - riving at the amount of working capital seems to have been entirely overlooked by counsel in filing exceptions and the final figure added to the valuation on account of this Item was alleged to have been due to errors in computation. There may have been errors in reasoning in this respect, but not in the computations. On rehearing, the company readjusted its original position and alleged that in place of consider - ing working capital as all the cash and materials on hand, working capital should be arrived at in a different manner. It did not support its allegations as to the items which should be included in reaching the amount. The Commission rejected as part of working capital, the amount existing in the injuries and damages reserve. This reserve created slowly from revenues and charged as operating expense is in lieu of carrying liability insurance. The amount thus set aside depends upon the judgment of the officers. If not thus set aside earnings In like amount would be available for dividends. This is quite unlike the accrual with which to pay taxes and Interest. Surplus has been sacri - ficed to create this reserve, all in the interest of stable service. Am equivalent amount of cash is there on hand. </seg>
            <seg id="p238">238 We conclude that so long as the policy is followed of leaving a onsiderable amount as a cushion fund in the injuries and damages reserve and so long as this is kept available for the purpose for which reated, in one form or another, it should be allowed as working capital n the valuation. We will therefore add $200,000 to the amount of working capital representing a fair average of the amount on hand or the Nebraska division during the past four or live years. GOING VALUE: — Throughout the brief in support of the ex - eptions the company has insisted that the element of "going value" was not given weight whereas under the holdings it was error not to ccept it. In the light of the discussion in the original opinion on ages 65 and 66, we do not see why this statement should be made. The reasoning seems to have been that because the final fair value gure announced did not measure up to expectations the element of oing value must have been omitted. FAIR VALVE We come now to reconsideration of the conclusions of the Cor tission as to the relative weight to be attached to different com itations in arriving at fair value of the property ml and usefu in determining rate base. While not listed as an exrep motion for rehearing, most of the brief in support of the ex was devoted to this subject. The reasoning of counsel is confusing to the Commission. After the company had presented voluntarily fou year average prices in its appraisal and inventory, it al hearing that this measure of fair value ought to have been entirely rejected and it urged with repeated force that there is but one measure of fair value, namely — appraisal at prices at the amount of apprais It is clear enough that the Com mission did not so view the case and that it did not follow the plan here urged. Subject to cert mus and adjustments the computations on all the sustained bases wer carried through and conclusions were reached from a consideration of the three measures presented. k While alleging that such a plan is wrong in law, counsel for plicant made the further point that even if these three measures ? all given weight they were not given weight in proper proportion. In support of this statement counsel used as a measure of the »roper weight to various elements, the conclusions of the courts in Galveston Electric Company v. City of OrimMi et al, 258 U. S. 388; S. \V. Bell Telephone Company v. Public Itilirics Commission (Mo.) 43 Sup. Ct. Rep. 54 4; City of Minneapolis v. Kami et al., 2 85 Federal 18. The point of counsel is that even if we had rejected the loading terns which were rejected and had given proper consideration to the elements going to make up fair value, our final valuation would have </seg>
            <seg id="p239">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 239 been not less than $16,000,000 and might readily have been $19, - 000,000. We cannot follow the computations of the brief. Counsel used in its comparisons of the case now before us with the cases cited, only the apparent weight given to present prices as compared with original cost, but rejected all other principles laid down in those cases in - cluding the weight given to the overhead or loading items, going value, and depreciation. Relying upon relatively obscure cases, counsel in - sisted that no deductions should be made for depreciation and applied this conclusion in computations based upon the Galveston, South Western Bell, and Minneapolis Gas cases regardless of the tact that in those cases the courts did recognize substantially the element of depreciation. The conclusion appears inescapable that if in measuring the equities involved in this case, we are to use the conclusions of the courts in various other cases, all the reasoning ot the courts in the compared rases should be used. When that is done it does not appear that the Commission's conclusion as to fair value in the case before us is any less liberal than that of the courts in the three main cases relied upon. As we read the cases the computations of counsel based upon them do not represent what was done in those cases. THE REJECTED OVERHEADS: — Repeated reference was made by counsel to items of the 1919 price level computations rejected by us in amount $2,622,709. Without going into detail with respect to this figure we merely point out that it is incorrect. It represents duplications and in one instance represents as an alleged deduction what was the tolal left in the property after the deductions were made. The figure represents far from the actual deductions that were made and recorded in the original opinion. CONCLUSIONS Having made allowance for the contractors' profits on buildings, the additional working capital discussed by us heretofore, we arrive at the conclusion that the fair value should be $14,100,000 in lien of $13,800,000 originally found by us. LISTING OF PROPERTY NOT IN RATE BASE: — The company asked that as an aid in its refinancing the Commission designate the assets of the company which were not included in the rate base, but which are clearly assets which might support outstanding securities. So far as this request relates to physical property rejected from the rate base, it can hardly be more clearly shown than in the opinion.

            <seg id="p241">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION- 241 OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION This matter arose on the petition of The Lincoln Traction com - pany (or further hearing for the purpose of determining proper rates for electricity and steam to be charged by applicant to its light and heat departments. Applicant also asked leave to make a further showing with reference to present earnings of its street railway de - partment and that the Commission increase Its rates of fare to provide an adequate return on the value of its street railway property. Concurrent with the above application the company filed ft motion for rehearing in the above entitled matter because of certain alleged errors as to fact and law In the Commission's finding of fair value of the company's property. (16 N. S. R. C. 243-259.) These motions were granted and the matter was heard by the Commission at its offices in Lincoln, January 14 and 15, 1924. The company's testimony consisted of several exhibits intended to show the invest merit costs and operating expenses in connection with the cost of electric current and switchboard and steam generated. This involved a careful separation of the investment In real estate, power house building, and equipment allocated to the boiler room. Including labor, fuel, repairs and other expenses from all of the power house costs. With the exception of the occasional use of one low pressure boiler, the steam passes from one bank of boilers to the prime-movers where it is converted Into electric current. The steam sold for heating purposes is taken from the engines in operation. However, all of the power is not manufactured from steam. The company has three Internal combustion engines which pro - duce a large part of the electric current used for all purposes. It has three steam turbines and only one simple Corliss engine. Much of the remaining equipment in the power house, including pumps used for various purposes, station piping, and wiring, are necessary to the operation of both boilers and engines. Therefore, a distinct separation between the boiler and engine room equipment and expense cannot be made, and conclusions drawn therefrom must depend on approximation to some extent. As the plant is operated the oil engines are given a uniform and continuous load well below the demand on the plant, and the fluctua - tions in the load caused by the operation of both the traction and lighting properties are carried by the steam equipment. This is to say that in a limited way the steam equipment serves as a standby for the internal combustion units. Much of the current used for traction purposes is generated, at some additional cost, as alternat- </seg>
            <seg id="p242">242 SEVENTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT ng and converted to direct. This is made necessary by reason of the act that the current sold to the lighting department must be alter - ating. The property in the boiler room is necessary throughout the ear for steam engine operation, which is required to a greater or ess degree regardless of the use of the oil engines, and absolutely equired should these engines fail. This is true, notwithstanding the act that exhaust steam is sold during seven or eight months of the ear. It is also true that the steam engines must be operated to a reater extent in the winter season on account of the heating de - artment regardless of the fact that a greater percentage of the urrent output might be manufactured with Diesel power. The company's allocation of value to the boiler room based &lt;&gt;u le Commission's finding for the entire property as of September 1, 919, is $202,882.67. Three-sevenths of this sum has been charged o steam heating only. When the one boiler used exclusively for leating purposes and additions and betterments to November 1, 1»23, las been added to this fraction this result is $97,378.00. Invest - ment charges, including interest, niainu-nance and depreciation, and axes, have been computed on this figure which results in a cost of nineteen cents per thousand pounds of steam sold. Boiler operating expenses for the year ending November It, itSS, t- a cost of 44.3 cents per thousand pounds of water evaporated The Commission has adjusted the value of the pr by the company to the boiler room and finds that it should i (2U2.672.03 as of September 1, l'jl'j. At this point the Commission will use a different bas allocation of property to steam heat and slightly differen ages in computing the fixed charges on the values used. The com- pany's fraction of three-sevenths is apparently based on the ratio of the load on the boilers for steam heating purpo A season to the total load for all purposes. This has the effect of harging the steam used for heating purposes with fixed expenses or the year when operation for this purpose is limited to six or seven months. The Commission believes that the ratio of the total amount of steam generated for all purposes to the steam sold is a more equitable division of these charges. This reduced the property alloca - ion to steam heat from three-sevenths, or practically forty-three per ent of the value of the boiler room property, to twenty-three per ent, or $46,614.77. When the equipment used exclusively tor steam heat and additions and betterments to November 30, 1923, has been added to this figure it becomes $53,851.88. The fixed charges against his sum are $9,539.73, or 8.3 cents per thousand pounds of water evaporated for heating purposes. </seg>
            <seg id="p243">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 243 In the following estimate the Commission will use the company's boiler room operating expenses for the year ending November 30, ttSS, which show an expense of 44.3 cents per thousand pounds of water evaporated and fixed charges of 8.3 cents as noted above. 44. 3 Operating expense Tot 79.38 K. W. at 1.6S cents 33.60 Cost per M lbs. steam sold 45.76 In the above calculation the Commission has used the company's percentage of loss in transmission of steam in the main but it has changed the back pressure on the engines from ten to fifteen per cent which is indicated by the company's exhibits which show the number of kilowatts per thousand pounds of water evaporated during the months when no steam is sold as compared with the winter months when steam is delivered from the engines for heating purposes. The Commission does not believe that the above computation is an exact measure of all the elements of cost. The allocation of property is necessarily approximate and the method of operation wherein the internal combustion engines are favored with a high id factor places a burden on the current produced with steam which is more or less unfair to the cost of steam kilowatts and water evaporated as well. If the cost of steam made kilowatts is reduced it is plain by this method of substraction that the cost of steam eenerated will be greater as the 1.68 cents per kilowatt is taken from the experience of the company. It Is also true that the sale of steam in winter months Influences the method of operation in a manner which results in less efficiency from the electric generating units. On the other hand, greater efficiency is secured from the boilers when steam is manufactured for sale. The Commission believes and so finds that the present rate of fifty cents per thousand pounds of steam sold, measured at the customer's meter, is a fair charge for this service and the Commission will use this figure in proceeding to its conclusion. The operating cost of the power plant for the year ending November 30, 1923, including general expenses, taxes, and interest at the rate of seven per cent on value allocated on this portion of the traction property, are as follows: Fixed expenses ..i Total expenses 52.60 Loss in mains — 35% Back pressure — 15%. 18.72 8.04 </seg>

H. generated 2.32c If the total number of kilowatts generated, or 16,369,206 is re- duced by 322,120, which is the loss due to the operation of motor generators in the plant, the cost per kilowatt hour becomes 2.37. The use of motor generators is made necessary by reason of the fact that part of the current must be converted from direct to alternat- ing which results from a demand for alternating current by the light and power department. The company owns real estate in the vicinity of the power plant which has not been included in its value. There is some doubt whether more of this property which has been acquired for the development of the street car service should not be charged to the generating plant. As the power plant grows additional ground will be acquired and this is the most fertile source of development In the future. The use of the power station has changed from exclusive street railway purposes to a point where 4,854,623 K. W are produced for the use of the parent company and 10,514,583 for the light and power department. The street railway company owns this property and care should be exercised to the end that street railway operation is not burdened by reason of the sale of electric current to the light and power department The Commission believes and so finds that 2.5 cents per K. W hour is a reasonable charge to the light and power department for electric current sold by the company measured on the switchboard and this rate also will be continued. The results of operation for the year ending November 30, 1923, are as follows: Transportation revenue .$597,056.64 Other than transportation revenue 316,393.74 Total revenue $913,4 50.3? Operation and maintenance 702,376.52 Operating income $211,073.86 Deductions from income 62,788.90 Net income $148,284.96 </seg>
            <seg id="p245">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 245 This statement shows an annual rate of return on the value of railway property as of December 31, 1923, of 5.27%. The deductions from income include general and miscellaneous expenses and taxes which should be allocated to the light and power department in the sum of (6,881.43. When this correction is made the net income on the railway property is $164,826.72, or a rate of return of 5.85%. This rate of return on the fair value of the railway property as found by the Commission is low and there is no reason to believe that it may increase in the near future. This is because of decreasing traffic, from obvious reasons, particularly affecting the smaller cities. Total revenue passengers, per annum, for the past eight years are as follows Years Passengers carried Revenue from transportation has fallen consistently since the year 1920, when it was $771,829.43, as compared with 1923 in the sum of $597,056.64. Revenue from other sources, including electric current and steam sold have increased materially in these years and operating expenses have been reduced, otherwise the annual rate of return would be much less than the above percentage. The Commis - sion cannot, under the law, deny financial relief under these condi - tions. The public has recently refused to provide the additional capital to pay (or new paving between the rails, although the com - pany offered to maintain it. This makes it necessary to turn to the rate schedules for additional revenue, which might not have been necessary if the public had assumed the burden of providing the new capital for the paving and the interest charges thereon. Applicant proposed that the cash fare be raised from eight to ten cents. This will only affect the occasional rider as the price of tokens will re - main the same. When additional revenues are required regular patrons of the service should be favored as compared with those who use it occasionally and depend on other means of transportation. The percentage of cash fare to the total for the year is 31.7 per cent. It is estimated that one-half of these fares may change to tokens if the cash rate is raised to ten cents. On this basis additional passenger revenue, on account of the increase of two cents cash In fares, will be $23,505.52 and a corresponding loss on account of change to tokens will be $5,876.58, or a net gain of $17,629.14.

The Commission believes and so finds that a cash fare of ten cents is reasonably required under existing conditions, and the token fares will not be changed. It was not urged by respondent municipalities that the company is now earning a fair return. It was urged that the increase in cash fares would so further depress traffic volume as to result in no financial relief, and that there would also be a further stimulation of the demand for competing motor bus service. These are problems of management. Such possibilities cannot lawfully be used by this Commission as reasons for ignoring the constitutional right of the company to earn, if it is able, fair wages for its invested capital.

Browne, Chairman. Attest: John E. Curtiss, Secretary. (SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 4247 In the Matter of the Application ot the Clearwater Telephone Com - pany for Authority to Issue and Sell $10,000 of Stock. OPINION' AM) FINDING TAYLOR, Commissioner: I Hiring the year 1919 the Antelope County Mutual Telephone company, which up to that time consisted of two exchanges, one at Elgin and the other at Clearwater, by mutual agreement of the stockholders, decided to separate the two exchanges. The old com - pany retained the exchange at Elgin. The stockholders who were served by the Clearwater exchange were to organize a new company. This they subsequently did and made application under the name of the Clearwater Telephone company for authority to issue $10,000 jinmon stock. Through failure to make complete showing as to why the full amount of $10,000 was needed, the matter has never been disposed of. Now the company renews its application. On October 1, 1919, the engineering department of the Commission submitted a valuation of the entire property of the Antelope County Mutual Telephone company. It found the original cost of the Clear - water exchange to be $9,846.5$ and the depreciated value to be $4,422.14. It was upon the basis of these figures that the property was divided. Since the separation some improvements have been made in the Clearwater property. There is reason to believe that it is now well worth the depreciated value as found by the engineers in 1919. While the company applies for an issue of $10,000 of stock, it modifies its application by letter and states that it will be content at this time with an issue of $4,440. Of this amount $3,720 worth of stock will be issued to the present owners of the property, most of whom were original stockholders in the Antelope County Mutual Telephone company. The additional $720 of stock will be sold and </seg>
            <seg id="p248">248 the proceeds used to replenish the depreciation reserve. The stock as applied tor is undoubtedly reasonably required by the corporation and should be authorized. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Clearwater Telephone company be, and the same hereby is, authorized to issue and sell, at not less than par, its common stock in the amount of $4,440. $3,720 of this amount shall be issued to the present owners of the property and $720 shall be sold and the proceeds applied to replace - ments. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that on or before ninety days from the date hereof, a report of the disposition of the securities herein authorized shall be made In writing to the Commission.

OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Chairman This application was filed in July, 1920, and on motion of the company was dismissed, without prejudice, April 12, 1922. On Febru - ary 13, 1924, motion was filed by applicant to reinstate said applica - tion and to have same considered on its merits. This motion has been granted. Applicant was originally an association. It issued what was called stock certificates, but which were merely certificates of interest. Said certificates totaled $6,000, being made up of 120 portions of face value $50 each. </seg>
            <seg id="p249">249 NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION Several years ago the company perfected the organization ot a corporation and filed its articles with the secretary of state, authoriz - ing common stock in maximum amount $10,000. Its purpose here is to secure the necessary legal consent to the Issuance of valid stock in exchange for the association's certificates ot interest, which are still in the hands of those who put in the capital for the development of the plant of the Herman Telephone company. In support of its application the company has directed the Commis - sion's attention to its annual report for 192 2 and description of Its property on page 12 thereof. This shows total owned stations of 384, a complete metallic system, including its farm lines, but with no real estate. The property account of the company shows an estimated total fixed investment gross of $17,285.45. This property has never been checked in the field by the Commission's engineers and is the result of certain accounting estimates only. The liabilities statement shows no indebtedness. It requires no hearing or inventory of plant to ascertain that this property is worth very much more than the amount of stock which it is desired shall be outstanding. It is not necessary that we pass on the value of the property. When the certificates of interest have been converted into certificates of stock the liabilities statement will show large surplus reserves invested.

SUPPLEMENTAL, ORDER C(As to Intervenors. Platte Valley Telephone Co. and Wehn Tele - one Company.) BROWNE, Chairman When this case was heard certain intervenors appeared, asking or authority to publish the same toll rate scales as might be author - zed to the chief applicant in this case, it being set forth that the large amount of interchange business made it necessary to have the same toll rate scales. In the order in this case, entered November 4, 1922, 15 N. S. R. C. 213-282 1 we approved certain toll rate changes for this applicant and withheld approval in the matter of intervenors until we might have further data as to the effect on revenue of such inter - venors. The cause of the delay in making findings on the petition of hese intervenors is well known to applicant and need not be detailed here. The Platte Valley Telephone company and the Wehn Telephone company, under approximate common ownership, and operating in the forth Platte Valley, were among the intervenors. Showing was made &gt;y that company that if allowed to publish the toll rate scales already approved for the major toll companies of the state the increase in groan revenue would be slightly more than $2,000 per annum, or between one and two per cent. This company owns exchanges in Wyoming and has already published in that state the scale of toll rates asked for In this matter. Originally there was free interchange between adjacent towns of he Platte Valley Telephone company, although not such free inter - hange on the Wehn Telephone company. Several years ago the Com - mission authorized the elimination, with certain exceptions, of the free oil business between adjacent towns and authorized a ten-cent toll rate. During the war this rate for the higher class of service, known as person to person, was increased, while the station to station service remained at the rate formerly approved by this Commission. The tandard toll scale, heretofore approved by us for the major toll com - panies, would provide an intertown person to person rate, which, to - gether with the war tax, would be twenty-live cents. The present rate </seg>
            <seg id="p251">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 251 tor person to person service (or this distance is fourteen cents. As heretofore stated, at one time the service was free. Applicant is willing that an exception be made to the standard toll scales so that for person to person messages of ten miles and less the ales should remain unchanged. There is no good reason why this independent company, operating under just as much difficulty as either of the larger companies, should not have the same toll rates. We will, therefore, with the exception to which the applicant has agreed, approve the standard toll scales for lntrastate business, excepting further those instances where now there Is a cone service without toll charge. The gross increase in revenue under these modifications will be less than one per cent. The increases are badly needed by the Wehn company which is not earning operating expenses and taxes. The Platte Valley company is almost earning its dividends and fixed charges without these adjustment changes in toll rates. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Platte Valley Telephone company and the Wehn Telephone company be and they are hereby authorized to publish and collect, from and after ten days' notice to the public, the following scale of toll charges: tlileaK&lt;° Station to Station Person to Person A tppointment and Messenger Report Charge 0- 10 10-16 16- 22 22- 28 28- 34 34- 40 40- 48 48- 56 56- 64 64- 72 72- 80 80- 88 88- 96 96-104 104-112 112-120 $ .10 15 .20 .25 .30 .35 .40 .45 .50 .55 .60 .65 .70 .75 .80 $ 14 .25 .30 .35 .40 .50 .55 .65 .70 .75 .85 .90 1.00 1.05 1.10 1.20 $ .25 .30 .35 .45 .50 .60 .70 .75 .85 .95 1.00 1.10 1.20 1.30 1.35 1.45 $ .10 .10 .10 .10 .10 .15 .15 .20 .20 .20 .25 .25 .30 .30 .30 .35 </seg>

Applicant made a very discouraging showing as to its passenger train earnings, but did not Include in the figures earnings from other sources than passenger fares. It was its position that the train did not pay out-of-pocket operating costs and that the remainder of the </seg>
            <seg id="p253">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 253 •ystem within the state of Nebraska was operated on such margins of net return that no surplus was left with which to offset the deficits on the particular line. Remonstrants insisted that the large reason for the poor showing on earnings was that the trains were so scheduled that people could not ride to Omaha and have there a sufficient inter - val In which to transact business before the return journey, and that they, therefore, either drove private vehicles or rode in busses. On June 13 of that year ,(16 N. S. R. C. 390-392) the Commission entered an order requiring the company to so change the schedules of the involved trains Nos. 637 and 63S, as to give five hours time In Omaha. It required also detailed studies of traffic volume and revenues during a 60-day period. The reports received, as a result of that preliminary order, covered 63 trips by each train. The average number of passengers carried on each trip was 38 and the average passenger earnings per train mile, 34 cents. The earnings from all sources on the south bound train were 65 cents per train mile and on the north bound train, 60 cents per train mile. The company alleged an out-of-pocket cost of 94 cents per train mile, although In another exhibit, covering a year's time, the out-of-pocket cost was shown to be 83 cents. A check of the passengers riding for a period of two months showed an average of nine and one-half persons riding the train for each mile It operated. While the Commission was not willing to accept the figures as to out-of-pocket operating expenses without careful check, it was reason - ably clear that as the trains were operated they did not pay out-of - pocket costs, with no allowance for maintenance of way and structures, a portion of which was properly chargeable against the trains la question. The company's application, however, constituted a confes - sion of abandonment of passenger train service as such, because the proposed schedule of a mixed train would not enable passengers to go anywhere and come back the same day. The line operates through one of the wealthiest agricultural sections of the state. Its inherent diffi - culty is that the trade territory is much circumscribed by other rail - roads. The per capita showing on ownership of automobiles is more than one for each family in the territory. These are difficulties which cannot be surmounted by either carrier or this Commission. We urged upon the carrier informally that in lieu of abandon - ment it should substitute for a trial period a cheaper method of transportation, such as a single car, gasoline-driven conveyance. By agreement between applicant and Commission, the case was held open pending the endeavor to work it out on some other method than </seg>

These diffi - culties have apparently, in part af least, been ironed out.

Consequently, there is very little traffic on this one - third of the total trip of the branch trains here involved.

SIPPLEMEXTAL ORDER HY THE COMMISSION: In the original order herein (15 N. S. R. C. 394-401) applicant was authorized to issue and sell its common stock In amount $50,000 and previous issues of common and preferred stock were validated in amounts $25,890 and $138,800 respectively. Since the date of the original order applicant has replaced with consent of the stock holders affected, $107,200 of preferred stock with an equal amount of common stock. The remainder of the $138,800 of preferred stock previously validated Is represented by $7,975 of treasury stock and $23,625 of preferred stock now outstanding. The company now asks for an order from this Commission validating its common stock issued in amount $107,200 which replaces an equal par amount of preferred stock, and seeks further to replace its present outstanding preferred stock of $23,625 with common stock in equal amount. It also desires to sell common stock in lieu of its present preferred treasury stock in amount $7,975 and to cancel the treasury preferred stock. The preferred treasury stock above mentioned was chiefly nmulated from the purchase of stock held by employees of the company. As an inducement to employees and others to invest their savings in the company's securities, it has been the plan of the com - pany to agree to take up the stock whenever the purchaser desired to dispose of it. In May 1923, the company filed with the secretary of state amendments of its original articles of incorporation which amend - ments provided for an authorized capital of $275,000 of common stock and $25,000 preferred. The original articles provided for $200,000 preferred and $100,000 common.

            <seg id="p257">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 257 At the time the railroads of the country were returned to the owners at the end of government control, Western Classification No. 56 was in effect between thirteen Jobbing points and Ne - braska stations. Nebraska Classification No. 1 applied between al! other stations in Nebraska. At the time the Nebraska Com - mission validated all of the rates, rules and charges that were In effect when the federal court dissolved its injunction against this Commission. Western Classification No. 57 was in effect from the major jobbing points and Nebraska stations. On the request of the Nebraska Commission the Interstate Com - merce Commission in its Docket No. 14625, agreed to a Joint investi - gation by the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Nebraska Commission, of the classifications, ratings, rules and class rates now in effect on Nebraska interstate and intrastate traffic. At the present time agents in Nebraska are required to handle three classifications in order to determine the proper rates to apply on Nebraska traffic. Classification No. 57 applies between jobbing points and Ne - tiniska stations. Nebraska No. 1 applies on all other intrastate traffic and No. 5 8 applies on all interstate traffic. This Com - mission is of the opinion that the joint investigation by the Inter - state and Nebraska Commissions will be materially simplified if the classification differences between intrastate and interstate traffic can be harmonized before the general joint hearing is commenced. To this end a hearing was held on May 27th at which time it was unanimously the sentiment of Nebraska shippers there represented, (hat one classification should apply on all Nebraska intrastate traffic. According to the testimony of the carriers' representatives, 95 per cent of the changes between Classification No. 57 and No. 58 represents reductions. The differences between Western Classification No. 57 and No. 58 ml Nebraska Classification No. 1 are very material. The packing rules, description of articles, minimum weights and ratings have heen materially changed since Nebraska Classification No. 1 was adopted. After careful consideration of all of the facts and circumstances surrounding the classification of class freight in this state ihe Com - mission is of the opinion that at this time the complicated situation that now exists might be simplified to a certain extent by authorizing the carriers to establish Western Classification No. 58 in lieu of Classification No. 57 to apply between the thirteen jobbing points and Nebraska stations. At an early date the Commission will set down for further hearing, the question of the adoption of a classification that will apply on all Nebraska intrastate traffic, to the end that, in the final determination 9 </seg>

OPINION AND FINDINGS BROWNE, Chairman: In the spring of 1923, applicant company completed the recon - struction of its telephone plant in University Place, changing it from manual to full automatic. It reconstructed much of the outside plant. extending the use of cable distribution, increased the trunks between Lincoln and University Place from 97 to 135, and constructed a new telephone central office in the city. It invested an additional amount f money, approximating $100,000, in this program Application was made to the Commission for authority to charge the subscribers of University Place the Lincoln rates inasmuch as complete automatic interchange of service was provided between the two exchanges. Hearing was held and argument submitted on May at the offices of the Commission The rate changes proposed by the application would increase business subscribers $1.00 a month and residence subscribers twenty - five cents per month. Farm line subscribers are no longer attached to the University Place exchange and none are affected by the applica - tion. The company submitted detailed testimony to show that the proposed rate increases, involving approximately $4,500 per year, would return to it not more than a fair return on the investment now existing in the exchange at University Place. The usual allocations of common expenses were made in arriving at this result. Respond - ents, representing the city of University Place, objected to the property account of the company, totaling $222,066.91 at the com - elusion of the reconstruction. At their request the Commission's </seg>
            <seg id="p260">260 engineer checked such portions of the property as were in dispute and filed a report, copy of which was submitted to respondents and to applicant, showing only small variations from the company's figures of additional investment. This check did not include the cost of the building, which was not in dispute. Contrary to the testimony it did show that a certain proportion of poles and cables in the city of Lincoln, installed by reason of the increase of intercommunication between the cities, had been charged into the cost of the University Place exchange. No further proceedings were asked by representa - tives of the city succeeding the furnishing to them of the copy of the engineer's report. By agreement the case had been held open to afford that opportunity. The company presented its testimony on three points: first and primary, that the additional investment entitled them to the addi - tional money asked in order that a return might be received on that investment, second, that the service to University Place had by reason of the reconstruction become identical with that of Lincoln, both in nature and extent, and third that discrimination existed by reason of continuing to charge different rates in University Place than in Lincoln. Respondents answered to the effect that the additional in - vestment had not been solicited by the subscribers of University Place and that the service furnished by the prior facilities had been reasonably sufficient. We are not impressed by the testimony of the company as to ihe need of additional revenue from University Place to meet the rewards essential for the heavy additional investment. Such rewards are, of course, the company's due when it invests additional dollars. We think the company overlooked the fact that the reconstruction program was not entirely for the benefit of the University Place subscribers. It is true that the plant in that growing city had become entirely saturated and there was little or no chance to take care of the growth that was continuing. In all telephone plants, when such situations arise, extensive reconstruction, both in central office and outside plant, has to be made and such reconstruction involves a certain amount of economical advance construction. However, the exigencies of the problem at the main Lincoln exchange were not overlooked in the reconstruction program. That exchange, too, has by growth become approximately filled to its maximum. It is not yet worn out and each additional year's use is very economical if inadequacy does not inter - pose irresistibly. The company transferred to the University Place exchange 464 Lincoln stations. This transfer was made possible by the reconstruction in University Place and relieved the main Lincoln office to that degree so that it can take care for a time of the additional city growth. It will thus be seen that two factors, only one of which existed in University Place, made the reconstruction at this time imperative. It would appear that the subscribers of the Lincoln </seg>
            <seg id="p261">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 261 exchange, benefited by the economies of this plan, should bear a portion of the burden of meeting the return on the additional investment. The problem, however, still exists. It appears to us that ques - tion, made secondary in the testimony of the company, viz.: dis - crimination, is really the main question in the case. There are now attached to the University Place switchboard twelve business sub - scribers and 44 2 residence subscribers who pay the Lincoln rates. Their service is identical with that of 80 business subscribers and 1155 residence subscribers who are paying a lesser rate. This situa - tion cannot continue to exist. It was suggested at the time of the hearing that the discrimina - tion might be removed by reducing the rates of those who are paying the higher amounts to the level of the rates paid by the majority of subscribers on the University Place exchange. This would cause a loss of revenue to the company of $1,500 and would in no way com - pensate it for the additional investment unless its prior earnings on the prior investment had produced more than a fair return. But the problem of discrimination does not end here. The subscribers of University Place by the manipulation of the dial on the instrument, receive identically the same service as any subscriber in Lincoln and are able to reach all subscribers in the Lincoln zone in the same manner as subscribers connected to the main exchange in Lincoln. In fact. University Place subscribers cannot, so far as service is concerned, tell to what exchange they are connected. The service ot University Place subscribers is physically identical with that of a very large number of subscribers in the south part of the city ot Lincoln. The Lincoln automatic system now comprises three central offices, the main one in the downtown section of Lincoln and addi - tional exchanges in South Lincoln and in University Place. The connections between University Place and the main office and between the South Lincoln exchange and the main office are identical in nature. The subscribers in South Lincoln pay the Lincoln rates. It was urged by respondents that the nature of the service in University Place is more limited than that in Lincoln and does not require so wide a use. therefore, the company is offering more service than the subscribers in University Place need and they are paying for that which is unessential. While no figures are at hand on the subject it is probable that the use of telephone facilities by subscribers In University Place is fully as wide as the use of telephone facilities by either merchants or private subscribers connected to the South Lincoln exchange, and fully as great as the use of telephone facilities by the people of West Lincoln and by merchants in the outlying sec - tions of the city of Lincoln. Fifty-seven per cent of all calls originat- </seg>
            <seg id="p262">262 SEVENTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT tin University Place pats over trunks to points outside the limits the exchange. The plant might have been so engineered as to provide for local service at University Place and toll messages between University Place and the rest of the zone. It was not so engineered and we think the history of the company in its University Place exchange warranted the present arrangement. In 1913. the rates in Lincoln, University Place, and various parts f the so-called Lincoln zone were readjusted in a case of wide im - ortance. A local rate was provided as an option for subscribers in 'niversity Place and a zone rate. The local business rate was $2.00 a month less than the zone rate. The local residence rate was twenty - ve cents a month less. At the time this arrangement was made t was assumed that the local service would be largely used. During the war. when telephone rates had to be readjusted to meet the rapidly increasing expenses, the local option at University Mace was eliminated and at the time of the elimination there were only three business subscribers and Id residence subscribers iontinu - ng to receive the local service. All others had exercised the option of paying a higher rate and getting service throughout the zone and hereby eliminating toll calls. While there was some difference in opinion among those representing the city of University Place, the general impression was that local rates and local service would not lave been satisfactory. In 1913, the business rate for zone service was ma HI .incoln and in University Place. The two-party rate was made $4.50, he one-party residence rate $2.25 and the two-party residence rate 1.75. It is seen that between 1913 and 1919 almost all the sub - scribers of University Place were paying the Lincoln rates. In IS* is, esidenre rates in Lincoln and University Place were raised twenty- Ive cents a month. No increases were made in the business rates, n 1919, further revenues being necessary, the Lincoln business rates were increased from $6.00 to $7.00 per month and the two-party &gt;usiness rate from $4.50 to $5.00 per month. Residence rates in Lincoln were raised an additional twenty-five cents, making them fifty cents a month higher than prior to the great war. No changes were made in University Place. bThus, at this time the University Place business rate has not in increased since 1913. The residence rates have been increased If as much as the Lincoln residence rates. Ult appears that discrimination does exist as between Lincoln rs of telephone service and University Place users of telephone </seg>
            <seg id="p263">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 263 service and that a large number of the subscribers in both towns use approximately the same range of service. This statement may not apply to business houses in the downtown section of the city of Lincoln. This discrimination might be removed by reducing Lincoln rates the amount of the last increase which took place in 1919. This would reduce the revenues from Lincoln approximately $30,000 per annum While this is a very desirable result, there is nothing in the trend of cost of doing business, or in the company's showing of net earnings which, at this time, warrants such action. The only other alternative is to place that portion of the University Place subscribers who are not now paying the Lincoln rates on the Lincoln basis, leaving them in the same relation to Lincoln subscribers they occupied during the years 1913 to 1919, inclusive. This is the inevitable conclusion of the evidence and we so flnd. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph company be and it hereby is authorized, effective February 1, 1924, to extend the existing scale of telephone rates of the two exchanges of the city of Lincoln to include the third automatic exchange and subscribers attached thereto located in the city of University Place. Made and entered at Lincoln, Nebraska, this twelfth day of January. 1924. NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION. Thorne A. Browne. Chairman. Attest: John E. Curtiss. Secretary. (SEAL) TAYLOR. Concurring: I concur in the conclusions reached by Chairman Browne, but I am prompted to supplement briefly his discussion of the reason* therefor. While the company acted in good faith in submitting a financial showing in support of the rates proposed in this case. It erred in so doing in my opinion, and should have restricted its case wholly to the question of discrimination arising out of existing condi - tions and out of the changes proposed. Except as to its ultimate aspects this is essentially a service readjustment proceeding. </seg>
            <seg id="p264">264 The University Place exchange had reached the end of its service life and had to be reconstructed. It was a manual exchange and mechanical complications incident to joint operation with the auto - matic exchange in Lincoln added to the cost and interfered with the service, plainly prompting its conversion to automatic. Northeast Lincoln, in the vicinity of the State Farm, and southeast University Place have gradually extended until they are now practically merged, being separated only by a street. This development had already - begun to call for duplicate construction, and a difference of rates in the two areas involved a discrimination that would inevitably have resulted in justifiable complaints. Rapid growth in the city of Lincoln proper called for an expan - sion of local facilities. Either the central exchange had to be enlarged at enormous cost or other exchanges had to be built or enlarged and subscribers transferred to them. The practical working capacity of ten thousand lines on the local office had been reached. With this situation confronting it in 1922, the company instituted a prolonged study of the field, it called in a corps of experts to assist in the survey. This was thorough. It involved a study of popula - tion growth and trends, a count of the houses and vacant lots, the direction and extent of residential, commercial and it velopment. and an analysis of all other conditions calculated to supply the needed information from which to make a reasonably reliable prediction as to where telephone Mil ice in Lincoln and its suburbs is likely to be required in the future Out of this survey a fundamental plan was evolve » termined that by enlarging the south Lincoln exchange and by locating a new exchange in northeast Lincoln, or. as an alternative. effecting a consolidation with a new and enlarged exchange at 'niversity Place, the probable growth in the city would be taken care f for years to come. Economical construction was the first cunsidera - ion in this fundamental plan. Because a large amount of existing &gt;roperty could be utilized and because the trend of growth in north - ast Lincoln was in the direction of University Place, it was concluded o consolidate a portion of northeast Lincoln with University Place nd thus render unnecessary the construction of an entirely new xchange. These changes have now been made. At a cost of $322,000 the company has reconstructed the University Place exchange, includim; the erection of a new building, rearranged the intermediate pole lines and wire circuits, has installed sufficient additional trunks to handle E traffic between the exchanges, and has transferred subscribers m the central office to both the south Lincoln and University Place hanges. We might add that the south Lincoln exchange was also </seg>
            <seg id="p265">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 265 materially enlarged and improved and several hundred subscribers from the central area transferred to that office. It is argued that University Place is a city "separate and dis - tinct from Lincoln" and that the people who reside in that "little community" hare "with but very few exceptions nothing in common with the city of Lincoln." It is inferred that the company arbitrarily, and without just cause, reached out and brought into the Lincoln area a community which has no greater commercial and social relations with Lincoln than any one of the eight-hundred or thousand towns in the state. If that be so, how did it happen that it required ninety - seven trunk lines to carry the traffic between University Place and Lincoln prior to the time any change was made in the physical facili - ties? If that be so, why was it that seven-hundred and eighty-two out of a total of eight-hundred and forty-eight subscribers on the University Place exchange voluntarily elected to pay twenty-five cents more per month for the privilege of talking to Lincoln and continued to do so for a period of five years prior to 1918? It there is no direct and intimate relationship between these two communities, how does it happen that of all the calls originating and terminating on the University Place switchboard 51.2 per cent are interchanged with Lincoln. Such a relationship does not exist with any other town in Lancaster county. Even Havelock, with which University Place has been compared, has no such flow of traffic to Lincoln, and for the very good reason that it is separated from the city by a distance of seven miles and there is a space of open country tor a distance of at least two miles between it and University Place. The relations of the University Place people to Lincoln are denned by what they actually do rather than by what they say they do. While they urged that they are a separate entity they readily concede that it would be highly disadvantageous if they were given rates for local exchange service only, with a message or toll rate for the interchange traffic between I'niversity Place and Lincoln. This proposal was almost unanimously rejected by protestants. While this close intermingling of Interests exists now, and has existed for several years, it will con - tinue to become more pronounced with the further growth of the two cities. The residential section at the point where the two com - munities now touch is growing quite rapidly and soon the identity of either in that particular section will be lost, except for the existence of arbitrary boundary lines. The survey made by the company took this fact into consideration, and the lines that have been laid out contemplate just such a course of development. In the dissenting opinion three counter-proposals to the one applied for by the company are submitted. One is to reduce all Lincoln rates to the level of the University Place scale and thus re - move the discrimination. It is conceded, however, that this would </seg>
            <seg id="p266">266 SEVENTEENTH ANNUAL RKFORT result in a revenue loss of (30,000 per year and that such a drastic slash in revenues should not be required without further investigation. In the second suggestion It is proposed that the rates of the sub - scribers who are transferred from the Lincoln exchange to the I niversity Place exchange be reduced to the University Place level, it being suggested that this would also remove the discrimination. Inasmuch as a large number of these subscribers reside as far south in Lincoln as 33rd street, and are thus well within the city of Lincoln, and will continue to receive identical service with their Lincoln neighbors, it is difficult to understand the statement that there would be no discrimination. Lincoln subscribers would continue to be charged 25 cents per month more for precisely the same kind and quantity of service as the group referred to. The only effect of this proposal would be to extend the zone of discrimination into a much wider area. The third suggestion is to restore the status quo by re - placing all of the subscribers who were transferred from Lincoln to University Place. Again it is asserted that this would remove the discrimination, but no explanation is offered as to the obvious in - equality that would exist between the subscribers, not only at the boundary line of the two communities, but between all subscribers in Lincoln and practically all subscribers in University Place. since it is not proposed to limit service to the University Place zone. If a subscriber living within the limits of the city of Lincoln were, under such circumstances, to move across the boundary line into University Place he would Immediately find his rate reduced 2 5 cents per Enth, notwithstanding he would continue to receive exactly th&lt;- h.ui vice as he had been receiving on the Lincoln exchange. No just ition for this discrimination is offered for the very good reaso; In my opinion, that none exists To summarize, therefore, we find that at University Place the hysical conditions of the plant required complete reconstruction. 'e find the facts show unmistakably an intimate relationship be - ween University Place and Lincoln and we find that discrimination xists on the existing scale of rates. It is perfectly apparent that the ompany in good faith, and after very careful study, exercised a udgment which is not questioned or criticized in this whole preened - ng except that it promises to make a slight rate increase on about ghteen-hundred subscribers in University Place which only has the Beet of bringing them up to the level paid by some sixteen-thousand ther subscribers receiving the same service. We are urged to sub - itute our judgment for that of the company and to order a rrstora on of the old conditions notwithstanding such a change would nvolve the immediate expenditure of many thousands of dollars, a sruption of a fundamental plan for the entire Lincoln zone and le ultimate expenditure of several hundred thousand dollars which ould otherwise not be necessary. In my opinion, such a proposal </seg>
            <seg id="p267">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 267 ; manifestly unsound. While it might temporarily relieve a com - aratively small group of patrons it would ultimately result, either n increased rates to all Lincoln and University Place telephone users, or to a postponement of general rate reductions from which all might receive benefits. RANDALL. Commissioner, dissenting: 1 dissent because it was not shown that this additional invest - ment was necessary to take care of the business at University Place. Nor was it shown that the present rates would not produce revenues sufficient to pay a reasonable return on the increased investment. The company presented its testimony on two points; first and primary, that the additional investment entitled it to the additional money asked in order that a return might be received on that in - vestment, but it was clearly shown by the testimony of the company that the business at University Place had outgrown its present capacity and that in order to take care of the increasing business at University Place it was necessary to increase the capacity of its exchange and lines: second, the company claimed that there was dis - crimination existing between the cities of Lincoln and University Place by reason that the company had cut over onto the University Place exchange from the Lincoln exchange 442 residence subscribers and 12 business subscribers, which made their service identical with SO business subscribers and 1155 subscribers of University Place who were paying a lesser rate. It was shown by the testimony that the Lincoln company voluntarily cut these above mentioned Lincoln subscribers over onto the University Place switchboard, whicn caused the discrimination to exist, as previously there were no Lincoln subscribers on the University Place switchboards. Hence, at that time no discrimination existed. If there is discrimination between the University Place and Lincoln subscribers, which there is at the present time by action of the telephone company, the Lincoln Tele - phone &amp; Telegraph company should be required to remove this dis - crimination by putting back on to the Lincoln switchboard the 442 residence and 12 business subscribers in Lincoln who are paying Lincoln rates. The company made the claim that as automatic phones had been substituted for the manual phones, the same as are used in Lincoln, that the University Place subscribers should be required to pay the same price as Lincoln subscribers. It was shown by the testimony that the University Place subscribers were entirely satisfied with the manual service and that there was no demand upon the part of the University Place subscribers for any change. It was further shown that the reason that the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegaph company </seg>
            <seg id="p268">268 transferred the 442 residence subscribers and 12 business subscribers to the University Place exchange was because the office in Lincoln had become congested and it was necessary, in order to take care f the growing business at the central office, to have more switching capacity for that office for the growing business. It was also shown hat the office in South Lincoln had been increased in capacity to take care of a certain part of the business that had formerly been handled t the central office in Lincoln and that transfer had been made both o the exchange in the south part of Lincoln and to the University Place exchange in order to relieve the congested condition of the main office in the city of Lincoln. University Place is a city separate and distinct from Lincoln, as much so as if it were further distant. Its residents are composed argely of people who are interested not in Lincoln, but in University 'lace, its school, and its churches. These people have moved into 'niversity Place and settled there for the purpose of educating their hildren at that particular school. They are a little community in hemselves. With but very few exceptions they have nothing in ommon with the city of Lincoln. There are banks, stores and other business houses in University Place, representing every line of busi - ness which is necessary for the needs of the residents and require - ments of the home, except perhaps drygoods and clothing, and this condition exists at Havelock. Waverly. and other towns of similar size, and the people who live there move in a little circle among themselves. Their social and business relations are practically confined to the limits of University Place. There may be a few who live there who are employed in the city of Lincoln and who leave their homes in the morning and return in the evening after their day's work and mingle socially with the people of their home town. University Place. The little town of Bethany, which is served l&gt;y he same exchange as University Place, is another school town where he people have settled in and around there on account of the school and they, too, have nothing in common with Lincoln, but are a little community by themselves and their social relations are limited, in a large degree, to the confines of the corporate limits of their town. They, too, would be called upon to pay an increased rate if the prayer of the company were granted. The town of Havelock lies adjacent both to University Place and Bethany and they are enjoying the same rmte that University Place and Bethany now are paying and are not asked by the company to pay an increased rate, notwithstanding the fact that they have the same number of phones at their command as Jniversity Place. The only difference is that they have an exchange of their own and it is manual service, and, of course, discrimination can - not be claimed because there are no Lincoln phones connected to their exchange. But had the Uncoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph company cut over onto that exchange a limited number of Lincoln phones then the </seg>
            <seg id="p269">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 269 company could have come in and claimed discrimination, the same as it has with the University Place exchange, and asked that all of the Havelock people be raised to Lincoln rates. It was clearly shown that the improvements made by this company were necessary to take care of the growing business, both in University Place and in Lincoln. It has not been shown that the present rate was not compensatory, both at University Place and at Lincoln. Th« only contention made is that this money has been Invested and that a discrimination exists and they have asked this Commission to increase the rates on 1155 subscribers and 80 business subscribers in University Place to cure the discrimination that the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Tele - graph company has brought about by its own act, and at the same time give it an Increased revenue of approximately $4,500 per year, which has not been shown to be necessary in order to pay a reasonable divi - dend and the usual percentage for upkeep from the present rates. It was shown that the subscribers service in University Place is more limited than in Lincoln and does not require so wide a use and that the company was offering more service than the subscribers in University Place needed. The discrimination that is existing between the University Place and Lincoln exchange subscribers might be removed by reducing the Lincoln rates the amount of the last increase, which took place in 1919. This would reduce revenues from Lincoln approximately $30, - 000 per annum, but would not be advisable until the company has been given an opportunity to show whether or not '.his would leave sufficient revenue to pay reasonable dividends and upkeep on the property; or, the 12 business subscribers and 442 residence Lincoln subscribers who pay the Lincoln rates could be reduced to the same rate as the Uni - versity Place subscribers at a loss of about $1,500 and remove the discrimination. If, however, they would put the 12 business and 442 residence subscribers of Lincoln back onto the Lincoln exchange, where they were, the discrimination would be removed, Lincoln sub - scribers would all be paying Lincoln rates, University Place sub - scribers would be paying University Place rates and the increased investment that has been made by the company would be amply taken care of by increase in business, which is fast developing by the in - creasing growth of both Lincoln and University Place. To me the duty of the Commission is plain, and that is to order the Lincoln Telephone &amp;. Telegraph company to at once put the 442 residence and 12 business subscribers, that are living in Lincoln, back onto the Lincoln exchange and remove the discrimination which they have caused by their own actions, and to dismiss the application to raise the University Place rates. </seg>

Appearances For the company, W. M. Cook, attorney; E. M. Davis, director OPINION AM) FINDING BROWNE, Chairman This applicant haa tiled amended articles of incorporation, pro - riding for stock of par value of $50 per share in lieu of provisions theretofore existing in its articles for stock of par value of $100 per share. There now exists It shares of stock outstanding of the par value of $100 each. The company desires to issue five shares of par value of $50 per share for each of such outstanding shares of par value of $100 per share. Notice of such intention was published in the local newspapers. The application was filed several months ago. The Commission suggested an order based on the records in its possession that gave the company the option of a hearing if it so desired. After some delay request was made for a hearing, which was had January 4. 1924. The early history of this case is well set out in our order on Appli - cation 4840 and need not be repeated. For that case the Commission's engineering department made an inventory in the field of the property of this company and tiled report with the Commission as to the esti - mated original cost of the physical property, which &lt;ost figure was enlarged ten per cent to meet estimated general expenditures which were In the main met from operating revenues from time to time. In that case the Commission found the fair value for a rate base to be $19,000, which included an intangible element, but nothing for in - creased unit values because a very large part of the property had been recently constructed at the very greatly enhanced cost of the present period. The company's books, which are being kept In accordance with the rules of the Commission, show that there has been a gross increase of fixed property in amount of $3,037 during the year 1923, of which $883 was secured from an accrual of reserves to take care of future replacements. The company has. therefore, added approximately $2,000 to its fixed plant, but it has reduced its current assets in so doing. It has also invested all its net earnings of the year. </seg>
            <seg id="p271">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 271 The book accounts of December 31, 1923, appear fairly closely to reflect the facts on plant as arrived at by the Commission in the rate case, amended by subsequent changes. The total assets on De - cember 31 was $26,046.98. In detail the liabilities were as follows: Common stock * 8.900.00 The record indicates that the company desires stock to represent the assessment paid and that it desires to retire its note indebtedness either through the sale of stock or through the application of earned dividends and the later capitalization of such payments. The present stock was issued in 1909. The history of the company indicates that the issue considerably exceeded the value of the plant. There has, however, from time to time additional value been put into plant from earnings. Scrutiny of the statement set forth above indi - cates that if stock is issued to reflect the cash assessments paid in 1922 and if ultimately stock is made to take the place of the notes payable the company wilt have a small red surplus, the hang-over from the financing of 1909. It would appear equitable and we so find that the cash assessment of $50 per share may be represented by stock certificate. Applicant desired that additional stock be placed in escrow to be Issued from time to time in equitable proportions as dividends are applied to the payment of notes which in turn were incurred in an extensive improve - ment program. There appears to be no particular advantage in escrow - ing this stock. We will approve the issuance of three shares of stock, par value $50 each, for each share of par value of $100 each as retired. We will also approve the issuance from time to time in legal and equit - able manner stock in fractional or whole shares to represent earned profits used in the retirement of notes payable, or for additional im - provements. The company should notify stockholders annually of the net earnings per share legally applicable to dividend payments and the purposes to which such net earnings have been devoted if not paid in cash.

The Commission authorized the company to sell $200,000 of pre - ferred stock, or bonds in like amount, under certain conditions. (16 N. S. R. C. 331-334). This was a preliminary order and the amount authorized was only such amount as the Commission felt it was pru - dent to authorize prior to the conclusion of the valuation investigation. That investigation has been completed and this is our final conclusion. At the time of the final hearing on January 2, 1924, the company submitted an amended application, asking for authority to issue and sell $300,000 of seven per cent first mortgage ten-year bonds at not less than 90 cents net to It in addition to all authorizations theretofore made of stock. It proposed out of the proceeds of the sale of bonds, if authorized, to retire $57,000 of underlying bonds, $58,000 of short - term notes due to banks, certain payables incurred by reason of con - struction, and to secure the funds with which to reconstruct Its power dam. When this company came under our jurisdiction it had $125,000 of common stock outstanding and certain mortgage indebtedness. We have from time to time considered applications on financing and hare Issued orders approving the issuance and sales of securities as follows: On Application 4460, and its supplements, $40,000 of common, $80,000 8 per cent preferred, and $105,000 of 7 per cent preferred stock. (14 N. S. R. C. 322-345. 16 N. S. R. C. 263-264). On Application 5180, $200,000 of 7 per cent preferred stock. (II N. S. R. C. 331-334). There is, therefore, authorized by us at this time $550,000 of ommon and preferred stock, of which $36,050 is in the treasury. In our preliminary order herein we gave the company the option to sell (a) Six per cent bonds in amount of $200,000; (b) Seven per cent preferred stock in amount of $200,000; or (c) $150,000 of pre - ferred stock and $50,000 of common stock. All orders of the Com - mission heretofore entered regarding preferred stock have carried the provision that not more than five per cent of discounts and selling expense might be added as legitimate construction costs, any addi - tional costs to be paid currently or over a series of years as expense. The company elected the option of preferred stock and has, since the preliminary order was entered, disposed of $163,950 face value. It was stated in the preliminary order that the reason for these repeated financings was the rapid development of applicant company, </seg>

This has been done by construction and by pur - chase, and financing was one of the most important problems. In support of its demands concluding financing to date the corn - any has submitted a detailed inventory and valuation of its properties, based in part upon cost, where construction was recently made, and in art on reproduction cost where properties constructed years ago have teen purchased. The Commission engineers have checked the roperties and have submitted estimates as to reasonable cost of onstruction at the time such construction was made. Here are the wo most prominent bases for arriving at fair value for rate-making urposes. This is not a rate case. The question arises as to what lall be the controlling influence in our conclusions as to approving le method of and extent of financing. The statute, which clothes the ommission with its existing authority, provides that the Commission tia.ll make investigation to determine whether the proposed issues of securities are "reasonably required" for the "acquisition of property, le construction, completion, extension, or improvement of facilities, r for the improvement or maintenance of its service, or for the dis - harge or lawful refunding of its obligations." The constitution also arries certain restrictions on corporations in the matter of issues of securities. It would appear, therefore, that the chief factor in a case f this kind is what the property has cost the corporation. This may r may not coincide with fair value. There may be elements legally ecessary to be considered in arriving at fair value, which have been old to the company for a nominal price or given to it, but which are ot essential to consider in a financing case. It Is necessary to consider whether the costs of properties were reasonably incurred. To that end ata on reproduction cost, fair value of tangible property, and original ost are factors to be considered.

            <seg id="p275">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 275 The Commission's engineering department reached the conclu - sions summarized below by taking the estimated reasonable cost at the time the construction was made, plus 15 per cent for overhead xpenses. and disregarding experienced purchase cost: I 744,175 Total In the totals of the company, representing present appraised value, are {49,599 (or materials and supplies and working cash. Our experience is that In a company of this kind a portion of the ma - terials and supplies is for construction purposes and interest on such property is included in valuation. The same property cannot be for construction purposes and for operating purposes also. The company has used as a measure for necessary cash two months revenues. We think two months operating expenses more nearly correct. Regarding actual cost to applicant since our previous valuation conclusions we find that the company has used the figure of actual cost as a basis from 1 which to work. The Commission's conclusions as to value were somewhat higher. Since those conclusions were the bases for financing at that time they should be used at this time as the starting point and the figure should be $344,594 after excluding Intangibles and working cash. The company has made no deductions for funds advanced by municipalities and has assumed that the funds were secured by sales of preferred stock on 10 per cent commission. It has also included $8,04 8 of Interest paid to the construction com - pany. This payment was proper, but inasmuch as the property was turned over and was earning revenues throughout the period of de - ferred payments that interest should be charged against revenues. The Commission's engineers, in their conclusions, omitted the amounts added by us in the original order on Application 4460, (14 N. S. R. C. 322-345 supra), in amount $21,384. There should also be added to the Commission's figures the cash working capital required and the five per cent for financing approved by us In several pre - ceding orders. We find the reasonable allowance for materials and supplies and working cash to be $34,000 and will use that figure In our com - putations.

            <seg id="p276">276 tmnisaion's estimated reasonable cost becomes $790,059 and the ual cost to the company 1773,986. The company has indicated its desire to retire approximately $28,000 of bills payable. A surrey of those bills indicates that a portion, at least, represents current operating accounts not subject to capitalization. The testimony was very incomplete on this subject. It has also Indicated the desire tor working capital which appears to be at least in part a duplication of allowance already made for work - ing capital. We have heretofore in authorizations provided that if selling costs f stock amount to ten per cent five per cent of that amount must epresent a charge elsewhere than against property. This ten per cent as a cost and it does not appear now, in the light of subsequent ex - perience, that it was an excessive cost. In purchasing two or three ' the properties now in its possession the company operated through Kansas construction company known as the Pioneer Engineering &amp; )eveloping company. Ten per cent of the net cost of the properties urchased represents the usual overheads of interest during construe - on, contingencies, contractor's margins, etc., not incurred here. It difficult to justify payment of that ten per cent except that the ompany had a rather unwise contract or that the future economies f operation may justify it. Applicant has also pointed out that it has aimed no intangible values due to its purchased water right at ebron. Consideration of all the facts, including the Commission's ppraisal of these properties on a prior occasion, would indicate that n a competitive field applicant actually did pay a considerable sum hich must represent intangible values. In considering a whole prop - rty of this kind it is only equitable to remember both the good bar - ains and apparent expensive purchases. All in all, we cannot say that the experienced cost to the com - pany, in spite of the criticism leveled at some factors by us, exceeds the fair value of the properties today, excluding intangible elements other than water power. There is in the company's total cost figure a dam which has been n a large measure destroyed. The headgates remain and a portion f the concrete dam is still available. The testimony justifies the as - umption that $55,000 was destroyed by the action of the elements nd that amount must be amortized out over a period of time. The &gt;ond discount must also be subjected to amortization. In keeping with ur previous orders we will require the company to set up a separate ssets account representing the excess selling cost of securities in mount of $11,818, but will not require it to be amortized. </seg>
            <seg id="p277">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 277 After embodying these conclusions with regard to the plant into the statement we can, for the purposes of this order only, prepare a rough balance sheet which will show the results after the sale of the bonds, but before any of the cash received from such sale has been used in retiring indebtedness. ASSETS Fixed property and working capital ($773,986, less 5 per cent on the preferred stock sold to Pioneer En - gineering Co. and less loss on dam) $ 707,168 Stock discount and excess selling cost 11,818 Loss on dam to be amortized 55,000 Bond discount to be amortized 30,000 Cash from sale of bonds after paying certain obligations 270,000 Receivables 116,495 Other assets 14,690 LIABILITIES Common stock $ 165,000 Preferred stock 348,950 Inderlying bonds 57,000 Current liabilities 187,500 Other liabilities 14,000 First mortgage bonds (this issue) 300,000 It will thus be seen that even though the contract for the pur- chase of certain properties with 25 per cent overhead may not be, as we think, entirely justifiable, the property protects the proposed senior obligations and the junior obligations heretofore approved. A condition of our approval will be that the discount on the bonds be amortized evenly through the life of the bonds and that the loss on the dam be amortized over a period not exceeding 20 years, the unamortized portion to appear as such on the balance sheet For eleven months of 1923 the company shows a net profit of $34,110.44 for fixed charges and on the Deshler plant, not included bove, a net profit of $1,915.52. This result is attained somewhat at the expense of the property in our opinion. Much of the plant is new and Inadequate provision was made in 1923 for future replace- ments. On the property, exclusive of the Deshler property, only $9,000 was set aside for reserve for renewals and contingencies. On a plant, the average value of which was approximately $460,000, this was less than two per cent. A condition of this order will be that the company set aside annually not less than three per cent of the fixed and depreciable property, the money to be used for specific purposes to be set out in the order below. </seg>

Browne, Chairman. Attest: John E. Curtiss, Secretary. (SEAL) APPLICATION NO. S211 In the Matter ot the Re-Hearing on Application of the Western Public Service Company of Colorado Springs, Colorado, for Authority to Construct, Operate and Maintain a Transmission Line from Auburn to Brownville, Howe and Nemaha in Nemaha County, Nebraska. Appearances : For applicant, Clarence A. Davis, attorney; Ralph Y. Pool, vice- president For protestant, H. H. Wheeler, chief engineer, Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph company, TAYLOR, Commissioner: This is an application by the Western Public Service company of Colorado Springs, Colorado, for re-hearing of the matters decided in order on Application No. 5211, (16 N. S. R. C. 350-352) wherein applicant was denied the necessary authority to construct, operate and maintain a transmission line along a certain highway between Auburn and Brownville for the reason that an alternate route is in existence which is reasonably adapted for the use of the power com - pany and which does not involve the necessity of long parallels with important telephone circuits. Hearings were held and testimony taken in the offices of the Commission October 29 and November 7, 1923. The testimony waa conflicting and representatives of the Commission inspected the route applied for and the alternative for the purpose of observing the physi - cal conditions. Applicant applied for authority to build a transmission line from the north part of Auburn due east eight miles to the village of Brownville on what is referred to in the testimony as the north road. From a point one mile east of Auburn the company proposes to </seg>
            <seg id="p280">280 Eld a branch south to the Tillage of Howe, also a branch south to village of Nemaha which connects with the main line at a point mile west of Brownville. tThe north road is a well graded highway apparently of standard th except near Auburn where it appears to be somewhat wider than customary sixty-six feet. The country near Auburn for a mile or more is flat, but soon becomes rolling and terminates in bluffs along the river as Brownville is approached from the west. The hills have been graded down and the low places filled with the waste material. The roadway in the cuts is approximately forty feet in width and sixty feet more or less at the top, depending upon the depth of the excavation. The space for pole lines is outside of the graded sections on the low ground along the fills which are from two to ten feet in height, and on the hills to one side of the cuts. A number of instances were noted where heavy tree-trimming will be necessary for short distances if a Ee line is constructed on the north side. It happens that the trees found near the homes of farm residents which may add to the ex - ise of clearing it away. IA telephone line has been constructed on the south side of the ;hway which consists of two through metallic toll circuits for the tire distance between Auburn and Brownville and one toll circuit for a distance of six miles east of Auburn where it turns north to the village of Peru. On the same pole line with the toll circuits there are ten grounded telephone wires for the first two miles east of Auburn, seven in the next mile, followed by five for one mile and three for the Et two miles. These grounded circuits supply the rural residents h telephone service over an area of about thirty square miles on h sides of the highway. If the transmission line is constructed in this location it will parallel two toll circuits for the entire distance between Auburn and Brownville and six miles of the line to Peru. It will also be necessary to metallize the grounded telephone lines in order to protect the service of the rural subscribers. The telephone company has esti - mated that it will cost $3923 to make all the farm lines metallic including the branches, and $2805 to metallize the lines throughout the parallel only. The Commission's observations in administering the transmission law since 1915 have convinced us that when a high voltage power line is in parallel with the grounded telephone cir - cuits for a mile or more the service on the telephone lines is serious - ly affected. I There are many substantial homes along this highway which are potential market for electric service, although no evidence was sub- Itted which will serve as a definite measure. </seg>
            <seg id="p281">281 The parallel highway one mile to the south is not a good road In the sense that it is well graded and adapted to auto motor transpor - tation. It is hilly and rough in spots but it can be used with a reasonable degree of safety by automobiles and other vehicles common to farm traffic. A section of the road about one mile in length where it crosses the Nemaha was the subject of much testimony for the reason that it is low and flat and water stands in pools after heavy rains. About one-fourth of a mile from the river the road turns to the south of the section line and approaches the bridge by a circuitous route. Trees and brush are also found in this location. Applicant contended that it would be difficult to maintain a pole line in certain seasons of the year and that it would be necessary to follow the curves in the road which would require much additional cost in the original con - struction. It is true that the trees and brush along the river present a formidable appearance but if the transmission line is projected on the section line across the river the wires will over-top much of the brush and the large trees can be trimmed or avoided. The Commission observed that the land on one sfde of the highway is farmed success - fully within a short distance of the river and the conditions are appar - ently the same on the opposite side although it is used for pasture. The road appears to vary in width from sixty-six to thirty-two feet. The record of the procedure when it was dedicated to the public, does not show the width that was intended. A large part of the variation occurs in the south line. Where fences, hedges or trees are used to mark the property line they appear to have been in their present location for many years. The volume of traffic is naturally small and regardless of what the legal width may be it ap - pears to satisfy the local requirements which it serves. More tree - trimming will be required for pole line construction in this location than is indicated by the conditions on the north road; however the trees are not of great size and some of this can be avoided by crossing the road with the line as both sides are not always obstructed in the same manner. The telephone company also has a telephone line along the south road but it offers to give the transmission line company the choice of location and move its lines to the opposite side. Conditions seem to favor the construction of the transmission line on the north side of the roadway and if this is done the irregularities apparent in the south property lines can be avoided to a large extent. When the branches south to Nemaha and Howe are considered in connection with the use of the south road it appears that the transmission line company can save approximately a mile of branch line construction; however, an additional mile of wire will be required for the line to Nemaha. We have here the question of a reasonable application of the rule of the Commission that it will not authorize the construction of a high </seg>
            <seg id="p282">282 oltage transmission line where important telephone circuits will be Tolved in parallel for substantial distances provided that a reasonable ternate highway exists. The north highway is attractive (or the reason that the roadway is well constructed and maintained. This hould be reflected in lower maintenance costs to the power company as compared with the south road. However, the (actor of safety in the aterials used in power line construction is necessarily large on account of the hazard. The first cost of construction on the north ighway would be affected by the fact that it would have to occupy the w ground to one side of the fills and in particular the high ground djacent to the cuts, many of which are deep. Tree conditions here, though not extensive, are substantial when they are encountered. An xtensive parallel with the toll circuits to Brownville and Peru would be created by the proposed construction. It would also be necessary to etallise the grounded farm lines involved in parallel at a substantial It the south road is used some of the adverse conditions can be avoided by crossing the highway. The conditions In the Immediate vicinity of the Nemaha river are objectionable but not insurmountable with the use of ordinary skill and Judgment. The legal width of the road appears to be In doubt bat the present property line* have bee* indicated by fences and otherwise for many years and if these are used aa a guide there is no reason to believe that they will be changed within a cycle of the life of the pole line. Obstacles in the way of pole line construction can be multiplied ndeflnitely and made to appear insurmountable as they have been here, or they can be brushed aside with eaae as the testimony f the protestant discloses. A monetary measure of these things is not the only consideration. The communication service, with its utslde connections, of a large number of residents In this locality is important and will be affected by the proposed construction on the north road. If the local lines are metallized an additional burden n the way of rates will come to an entire community. The advantage* of the new service would be available only to a small number of the ubecribera. The long parallel with the toll lines which connect the villages and towns cannot be avoided. Having all these facts in mind the Commission believes and so finds that the reasonable safety, operation and efficiency of exist - ing telephone lines on the north highway will be interfered with and that order in Application No. 5211 of the Commission in this matter should be affirmed. </seg>

Made and entered at Lincoln, Nebraska, this twenty-second day of January, 1924. NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION, Thome A. Browne, Chairman. Attest: John E. Curtiss, Secretary. (SEAL) BROWNE, Chairman: (Concurring) It seems to me there Is Just one question In this case and that many of the matters that have been brought into it were unnecessary in the determination. The rule of the Commission laid down on many occasions is that where important signal lines are to be paralleled for considerable distances by high voltage power lines the parallel should be avoided when a reasonable alternative route can be used. That this is a sound rule is concurred in apparently by counsel for applicant in a statement of record (transcript vol. 2, p. 46). Two routes were under consideration. I have examined the testimony with care because of the very divergent views of my colleagues, both of whom drove over two routes, and my conclusion is that the alter - native, or south road, is a reasonably available route and that the use of the north road asked for by the power company should be denied. The proposed alternative route is not an automobile speedway and portions of it probably impracticable after heavy rains. The occasional use of teams and wagons in repair work does not, in my opinion, constitute an insuperable obstacle to maintenance. </seg>
            <seg id="p284">284 Much that has been said by my dissenting colleague appears to me not only to be outside the issues here presented, but erroneous as to statement of (act and of law. I hare been unable to read from the testimony that respondent telephone company offered to withdraw objections upon the payment to it of certain investment costs. On the other hand, it appears to me that the offer of the telephone company was illiberal and an unfair requirement to make of the transmission line company. I have been unable to read in the testi - mony of Witnesses Coddington and Wheeler any more bias than is ordinarily observed in witnesses appearing for specific litigants. The relations of Mr. Coddington to the respondent company have been well known to the Commission for many years and he did not sail under false colors. The order in this case is no more a precedent than many previous orders from this Commission in like cases have been and is in keep - ing with them. It also, in my opinion, fully conforms to our duty under the statute. The minority opinion appears to confuse the result of different voltages of power lines in parallel with signal circuits. Our rule does not anywise prevent electric rural service in any locality of the state, but may on a limited number of highways cause somewhat higher cost to power companies. I agree with the minority opinion that suggested change of rural rates at the Auburn exchange, if the transmission line is allowed on the highway it desires to follow, is not a sufficient reason for denial of the use of that highway. No change of rates might be necessary. However, the additional investment has a tendency in that direction. The minority opinion, however, does propose to settle a very per - plexing question in the proposed requirements that telephone com - panies must make rural lines metallic whenever essential to con - tinued good service by reason of proximity of later-coming power lines. This question has been presented to the Commission many times, but its determination has not been essential to the settle - ment of controversies thus far, nor should the Commission offer any final suggestions as to the equities, until the problem has to be solved. Certainly it is not a matter which can be decided hastily and lightly. It is quite beside the point to discuss whether inductive inter - ference will result if applicant's desired route is approved. Many volumes of testimony are in the Commission's flies on this subject and views are widely divergent. That inductive interference does </seg>
            <seg id="p285">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 285 exlat is certain. The extent of the interference with signal circuits is in dispute, but as I read the record the rule of the Commission is not under dispute and our conclusions must be based purely on the question whether the so-called south road is reasonably available. RANDALL, Commissioner: (Dissenting) Hearing was had on this application on August 8, 1923, before the entire Commission. There was nothing special in the testimony that would show that this transmission line, if erected on the proposed route, that is, on the main highway from Brownville to Auburn, would be detrimental to telephone service more than in other similar cir - cumstances. But, as the Commission is anxious to obviate as much as possible any unnecessary inconvenience to the telephone company's patrons by induction the decision in this matter was based largely upon a statement made under oath by Mr. H. H. Wheeler, Jr., which, on investigation later by the engineer and secretary of the Commission and by one of the commissioners, was found to be very misleading and in some respects far from the actual facts, and I herewith quote in full Mr. Wheeler's statement: "On the route the company has given between Auburn and Brownville the telephone company has a toll line between Auburn and Peru for six miles east of Auburn; it also has a toll cir - cuit between Auburn and Brownville for the entire distance, it also has a toll circuit between Auburn, Brownville, and Nemaha, the section of which between Auburn and Brownville is en - tirely on this route. For its purposes in other matters the Telephone company makes occasional checks of the business done over Its toll lines. For definite reasons the month of August is selected for this purpose; our analysis of this line for the month of August, 1922, shows that Auburn-Brownvllle circuit carried 516 messages, producing $84.69 in revenue; that the Auburn-Brownville-Nemaha circuit carried 681 messages, producing $227.01 in revenue; that the Auburn-Peru circuit carried 760 messages, producing $309.55 in revenue; in total all three lines carried 1,957 messages and returned an income of $631.25. We are advised by letter from T. C. Daugherty, county surveyor of Nemaha county, that the public road running di - rectly from Auburn to Brownville is four rods or sixty-six feet in width till it reaches the corporate limits of Brownville, where the principal street is eighty feet in width, so that the separa - tion or spacing of seventy-six feet as proposed by the power company is not possible unless the line is constructed off of the public highway. BY MR. BROWNE: 'Q. Are your toll lines in the highway or in the fence line? "A. They are in the highway on what we call the twenty - seven foot line, being six feet from the outside of the road for </seg>
            <seg id="p286">SEVENTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 286 the most part. My recollections Is that that is true exclusively between Auburn and Brownvllle. "I went to Auburn on August 3 and interviewed Mr. George Coddington, who is an old resident of Nemaha county, having lived there upwards of twenty years, a man of wide farming and banking interests; Mr. Coddington himself resides in Auburn but owns farm property one mile south of the main east and west highway approximately one-quarter of a mile east of the main north and south highway through Auburn. I inquired from Mr. Coddington who the influential people were living on the high - way between Auburn and Brownville. He referred me to three individuals, William Ball, who resides a mile and a half east of Auburn, Mr. S. Hosterman, who lives six and three-quarters miles of Auburn, and Mr. Louis Magor who lives five miles east of Auburn, all of these men being farmers. From these I under - took to gather the story as presented to them by the power com - pany. All of them reported that they had been invited to go to the power company's office in Auburn for the purpose of negotiating with them for rural electric service; at this meeting there were ten persons present. Either because of lack of turn - out, or for some other reason no definite thing was accomplished. They were again invited to attend a meeting at a little school in the neighborhood, twenty-five rural residents were present. Their testimony was that no contract for electric service had been signed, but that the power company had offered contract for signature. Mr. Ball has had no inclination to buy electric ser - vice for the reasons that he believes the present charges either required or demanded are decidedly more than the service is worth; he is of the opinion that sooner or later this service will be offered by some one at what he considers a more reasonable rate. Mr. Ball is not the sort of man who would influence his friends and neighbors. Mr. Hosterman is the sort of man who would and he is the king-pin of the neighborhood. He claims that the power company's request that their rural subscribers contributions amounted in fact to a contribution of $2500 on their part collectively, which would be equivalent to the contribution made by each of the villages of Howe and Nemaha as represented to him by the power people; for himself he is not now ready nor does he know anyone in the neighborhood or vicinity who is ready to sign a lighting contract under the proposed term. Mr. Louis Magor has about the largest farm in this neighborhood; he resides five miles east and is a young man, lots of pep and in - spiration, keen about organizing. It was him principally to whom the power company's effort to sign a contract were directed; he had not signed a contract on August 3 and did not propose to under the present charges and in reply to questions as to who if anyone had approached the power company to build this line for their purposes, asking for service, I could find nothing to in - dicate that any rural resident did. I drove the road one mile south of the proposed route, it in all weather is not so good a road as the main highway; neither is North 27th street in Lin - coln an equivalent of the Cornhusker. These two highways are quite similar as to their differences with one exception, the south road cannot follow the section line at the river crossing, dis - appears somewhat from it, snakes around through a timbered stretch. The telephone line occupying one side of the highway on the south route is now occupying the less good side from the viewpoint of clearance from trees. The opposite is true on the main highway. My estimate of the clearance required by the </seg>
            <seg id="p287">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 287 power company should it elect to use one road as against the other would not be materially different. I made inquiry of Mr. Barney Mclninch, who resides on the road a mile south at a point six and a half miles east of Auburn as to whether or not a solicitation had been made on the power company's part for rural customers there, to his knowledge there had not. Mr. Coddington informed me that he had not been approached on this subject nor had the people on this highway to his knowledge been invited to attend a gathering to consider this thing. I counted the farmsteads on this main highway and found that there are twenty-seven on the highway or that could be con - veniently reached from it, not more than one quarter of a mile away. Likewise I counted the farmsteads which might be served on the south highway and found there were twenty-three on that route, so that as to number the difference is as twenty-three is to twenty-seven. The matter of ability to buy this service and the desire for it might be in a measure expressed by evidences of types of farm and types of residence structures. If that la true the difference would favor the main road but not greatly so. I was informed by Mr. Coddington that as a matter of fact there were more tenants on the main highway in proportion to the number of farms there occupied and oppositely more owners occupying the south road. There is an exhibit marked showing the farmsteads located in that vicinity." After the decision of the Commission was rendered, refusing the transmission compauy the right to use the main road, but com - pelling it to take the south road suggested by Mr. Wheeler, at the request of Mr. Davis, attorney for the transmission line, Mr. Forbes, engineer for the Railway Commission, Mr. Curtiss, secretary of the Commission, and Mr. Randall, one of the commissioners, made ■&gt; personal inspection of the main highway, and also the southern route as proposed by Mr. Wheeler in his statement and afterwards the route provided by the Commission in its order Issued September 4, 1923. and found that the route applied for by the transmission com - pany was the main highway from Auburn to Brownville and that the southern route was in no comparison with the main highway, either for telephone lines, transmission lines, or for any purpose; that at the time this inspection was made it waa impossible to go over the southern route, across the Nemaha bottom, with an auto - mobile; that Mr. Forbes. Mr. Curtiss and Mr. Randall were stack in the mud and were compelled to turn around and go back another route in order to get to the eaat part of this southern road. Upon application made by the transmission company a rehearing was held on October 29, 1923, in the offices of the Commission and herewith is produced the testimony of Mr. B. E. Forbes, engineer for the Commission: "Q. Now, Mr. Forbes, you have been over this road. Too are familiar with the evidence presented in the previous hearing? A. Yes sir. </seg>
            <seg id="p288">288 Q. You have been over the proposed highway (or which this application was originally filed? A. I have. Q. And hare you also been over the proposed alternative route which ia one mile south or the route in the orginlal appli - cation? A. Tes sir. Q. Now referring to the alternative route which is the route between sections 2 2 and 27, between 23 and 26, 24 and 25, 19 and 30, 20 and 29, 21 and 28, 22 and 27, 23 and 26, referred to on this map, — in the first place, Mr. Forbes, will you tell us as to the apparent width of the highway at its various sections? A. Beginning with the mile between sections 22 and 27. the apparent width is approximately the regular width of the ordinary highway. We didn't make any measurements but it was apparently the full width. The second mile is considerably lower as evidenced by the fence line. That is the mile between 23 and 26. I note on this map a series of measurements between the various sections along the highway and that seems to re - flect the widths as I observed them. I stepped off the width in one or two instances but these are apparently correct. Taken as a whole they are correct, apparently. Q. What would you say was the approximate width of the fence line at the beginning of the corner of section 22 and 27, 23 and 26. first towards the east? A. This shows 35 feet. I think that is correct. That is the one that I stepped off. Q. Do you recall the location of the cornerstone with reference to the south fence? A. Yes, it was — the south fence was apparently 15 feet from the cornerstone. Q. Now coming down to the line between sections 24 and 25 at the point where the map shows a detour about a certain grove and for the two miles, for the mile east of that point, will you tell us the apparent condition of the road there as to the possibility of traveling it? A. We proceeded on the highway from the south, south - west corner of section 24, for approximately a quarter of a mile when the road turned to the right and at this point we were unable to proceed further on account of the condition of the road. It was so muddy. Q. Now was that occasioned by any recent rainfall or were the other roads in the vicinity passable? A. The other roads were dry but this one was very muddy. So much so, in fact, that we couldn't get through. Q. What do you recall as to the tree trimming, more parti - cularly with relation to a grove of walnut trees on the south side in section 26? A. There was a heavy row of trees for some distance on the north side of section 26. Q. On the south side of the road? A. Yes sir. Q. And do you recall approximately the 66 foot road line where that traversed this walnut grove? A. Yes, I stepped off the 3 3 foot measurement to the south. It apparently fell inside the row of walnut trees. Q. Now beginning with the mile between sections 20 and 29, what about the condition of the roads there as to passability. </seg>
            <seg id="p289">289 10 etc. Give us a description of the general condition of this high- A. Generally speaking, the tree conditions are bad, the country was rough, the telephone poles, as Indicated on the map, were raked to the north to permit its existence without Inter - ference of trees. Q. What would you say as to the general angle at which these telephone poles were set through these three miles to the tree turning? A. I should think that the poles are raked about twenty degrees. Q. And some are as much as twenty-fire? A. More than that. A. niuic luau mail Q. Now, you haven't made any examination of the right of way on these section lines other than the apparent fence line, have you? A. No sir. Q. Do you recall how many telephone wires go through here? Through these last three miles that we are talking about? A. I think there was one mile, to my recollection, possibly two, that I remember seeing one wire in a good many places. Q. And that on what side? A. That is on the south side of the highway. Q. Tell us about it. A. Well, the one wire is on native poles. I think they are about fourteen or sixteen foot poles. Q. Now what was the general condition of this highway from the eastern to the western location of it as to the amount of traffic which is on It? A. There is apparently little traffic on the highway judging from the use of it. Q. And what about its state of repair and upkeep? A. Very poor. I doubt whether there is any work done on the road to maintain It. Q. Give us your observations as to the dwellings on the highway from the one terminus to the other, as to their number and their general character. A. Beyond the first mile, between Sections 22 and 27, I don't recall. I think five or six residences of very ordinary character. Q. Did you say they were of ordinary character? A. Well, less than that. Very small inferior farm resi - dences. Q. Now coming back to the other highway, which Is the one sought in the application, will you give us your observations as to the width of this highway between the fence lines at various points as you observed it? A. Apparently, greater than the standard width of 66 feet. I should think it might be 75 feet wide at a considerable distance. Q. What would you say as to the amount of tree trimming which was necessary in construction on the north side of this main highway. A. It is very light as compared to the south side. Com - paratively, much less. Q. That would be on either side of the routes? A. Yes sir. Q. This highway is apparently the main route of traffic be - tween Brownville and Auburn? A. It is a graded highway. A main highway. </seg>
            <seg id="p290">290 Q. Now will you just give us your observation in general as to the relative feasibility of construction of the transmission line down the south side of the alternative highway as compared with the north side of the main highway? A. I should think the tree condition along the south high - way, combined with the irregular width and th&gt; character of the country being so rough, would make it a good deal more ex - pensive than on the north. Q. Would you, from the testimony that was given at th» previous hearing as to the amount of traffic which this transmls - sion line has, as to the amount of customers it is to serve, and communities it is to serve, would you say that it was feasible to construct a transmission line for those purposes down the alternative highway? A. Well, eliminating the matter of customers for the mo - ment, I wouldn't consider it feasible to construct the transmission line on account of the physical condition only. Of course, the prospect for customers would naturally be greater on the north highway. The number of residences and their character on the north highway indicate greater prospect for the sale of service than there would be on the south. In fact, I only saw one or two residences on the south side that looked as though they might possibly be in a position to justify the purchase of current. Q. And what about the north? A. A good many residences. Q. How many would you approximate? A. I didn't count them. There are a good many fine farm homes along the north side. Q. That is all that I think of for just the moment anyway Such is the testimony of the engineer of the Commission. It will be noted that his testimony is positive that it is impractical to build this line on the only alternative route proposed. In view of this testimony it seems clear that It is the duty of the Commission to follow the testimony of its engineer. If his testimony is not to be followed under such circumstances as these, why should the Commission have an engineer? He is employed by the state for the very purpose of having a disinterested expert engineer to advise the Commission on technical matters about which their own judgment is necessarily inferior to his. In such a case as this there is a con - flict in the testimony, if the Commission is to judge the evidence and flaunt the opinion of its own engineer, then the engineering de - partment of the Commission had as well be abolished. It is incon - ceivable to us that this Commission can do anything but follow the advice of its own experts on technical matters (such as line con - ■tructlon undoubtedly is). Also, Mr. John E. Curtiss, secretary of the Commission, gave the conditions and comparison of the two routes as follows: "Q. You have driven over both of these highways which are under discussion in this hearing? A. Yes sir. </seg>
            <seg id="p291">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 291 Q. Will you tell us your observations as to the general width of the alternative highway in question? The South road we will call it? A. The first mile of the south route appeared to be legal and of the usual width of country highways. From there on east the route varied and was very irregular, breaking in width even within the same mile. For instance, the width of the highway would start out 40 feet, we would say, and then we would go down the highway for a distance and find a jog in the road of 15 feet one way or another on the same highway. Practically all of the highway outside of the first mile appeared to be con - siderably less than the usual width of country highways. Q. Then tell us as to the general conditions of this road as to the possibility of traveling it; such as for maintenance purposes of a transmission line, or any kind of heavy hauling. A. There were parts of the highway that seemed to be in very good condition. However, there was one mile in particular that would have been, I think, absolutely impassable for any automobile. There were other miles to the east of the mile that goes thru the swamp or wilderness which are decidedly hilly and very rough but they were passable under difficulty. Q. Then tell us your observations as to the dwellings along the alternative south road. A. Generally speaking, they were of decidedly inferior claaa as compared with the usual farm home in that section of Ne - braska. Q. And what would you say as to their number? Would you say it was thickly settled or sparsely settled? A. I would say it was sparsely settled. Q. And what as to the condition of trees along the south side of the highway? A. For about several miles the trees were very thick. Q. And what as to the kind and type of trees? Were those native timber, or are they planted? And what are they? Did you notice? A. You are speaking particularly of the south side? Q. Yes sir. A. There was one walnut grove the second mile, I believe, as we came from the west, which appeared to be planted. That would be my guess at least. Most of the way, however, it was native timber and appeared to be growing in a state of wilderness. Q. Now referring to the main highway between Auburn and Brownville, what was your observation as to the width of that after driving over it? A. Well, it was my guess, although I made no measure - ments, that it was slightly wider than the average country highway. Q. And as to its general condition being passable? A. It was in very good condition. Q. It being possible to travel over it from what you saw? A. It is In very good condition. Q. What was your observation as to the farm homes along this highway? The main highway? A. Generally speaking, they seemed to be a high type of farm home. Q. What would you say as to the number as compared to the other road? A. More of them I believe. Q. I think that is all." </seg>
            <seg id="p292">292 SEVENTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT Both Mr. Forbes and Mr. Curtiss are in no way interested In either the telephone or transmission lines and their testimony is given from an unbiased but personal observation of the two routes, and in my judgment ought to be given more weight by the Commission than the testimony of either of the interested parties. The south - ern route, as is shown in Mr. Forbes' and Mr. Curtiss' testimony, la nothing but a neglected! country road for a large part of the dis - tance and the exhibits presented by the telephone company at the rehearing held on November 8, 1923, show the road of irregular width, poorly maintained, and with grass growing in the roadway and is evidence in itself that it ie a road that is very little used and that the upkeep is practically nil. The farm improvements on the south road are of very inferior quality and the question of the Belling of electricity to occupants of these farms would be very re - mote, while on the north route, as the testimony of Mr. Forbes and Mr. Curtiss will show, the homes are of very much higher quality and very much more numerous. It will he noted that Mr Wheeler says in his testimony that the only difference Is as twenty-three la to twenty-seven, while as a matter of fact this is not the fact and la so evidenced by the testimony of both Mr. Forbes and Mr. Curtiss and by the personal observation of Commissioner Randall. It has also developed that Mr. Wheeler's information th quoted to the Commission in his statement was lare n ti Mr. George Coddington, who, Mr. Wheeler says, I interests, and "who is an old resident of Nemaha td there upwards of twenty years, a man of wide farming an king interests: Mr. Coddington himself residing in Auburn hi \ owning farm property one mile south of th w highway approximately one-quarter of a mile east and south highway through Auburn." Tt i ( stockholder and one of the officers of the Lincoln Tele &lt;v raph company. This fact was developed at the hearing on Novem - ber 8, and his statements, if he is correctly quoted hy Mr Wheeler. re also deceiving to the commissioner. A statement was made by r. Mattison, general manager of the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Tele - raph company, at the hearing held November s in the Commissions Sees, that if the transmission company would make the farm lines. hich would be affected by this north routing. Metallic that the lephone company would withdraw its objection. This statement, how - ver, was not made a matter of record as Mr. Mattison was not nder oath, but Mr. Wheeler made a statement that was reduced writing and is a part of the record, which is as follows: "Heretofore in this instance and in other instances the tele - phone company has endeavored to make plain to the Commis - sion their position with regard to proposed parallels with their toll property. Setting up that when and if another highway </seg>
            <seg id="p293">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 293 in offering such parallels exist it should be used for the power construction. The testimony today in this case has endeavored to show on our part that such a highway does exist. It has. however, been contradictory to evidence offered by the power company. One of the objections offered by the power com - pany is that one or the other of the proposed alternative routes has no freedom from trees. This objection took the form of offering higher costs because of the usual requirement of the telephone company that its present lines be moved from the side of the road desired to be occupied by the power people to the other side. In such instances the telephone company by agreement specified with the power company that it shall bear this cost and place the telephone line in reasonably good oper - ating condition. The telephone company in this instance definitely offers to clear either side of this proposed alternative route of its existing construction, offering the proposed occupants their choice of sides throughout the entire length of seven miles or any section thereof. We wish the Commission to take cognizance of the exchange property of the telephone company now exist - ing on the main highway. Whereas it is true that we believe the important consideration from the viewpoint of our system as a whole makes it of first importance that we give our toll property greatest consideration in this matter, there is a peculiar instance at the Auburn and Brownville exchanges which de - serves recognition here. This is the fact that the main high - way is used by us to carry not only the toll line between Brownville and Auburn but also the present farm line routes. These farm line routes serve approximately 75 rural subscribers. We feel it safe to say that the presence of a transmission line on this highway o&lt; the proposed character would make it neces - sary that improvement in the type of construction be made. What we ordinarily call 'making the circuits metallic'. The burden of this would, of course, be borne by the subscribers affected. It has been heretofore pointed out that the matter is related also to rates. The telephone company offers this proposition. That if the power company will contract with it to pay the cost of such improvements or of such removal of the present telephone property which may be made necessary in the interest of reasonably good service to its patrons by the presence of the proposed transmission line, that it will with - draw any objections to the original proposal routing, this Com - mission to be the judge of the effects of the presence of the transmission line and of the necessity for improvement or re - moval of its property." In my judgment the decision in this case -will establish a precedent that will be followed by the Commission in the future, or telephone companies will have a right to expect that It will be, at least, and it is very important that the matter should be settled in a way that will do justice not only to the transmission Una, bat to the telephone line, and patrons of the telephone company and those desiring to obtain light and power from transmission lines that may be constructed not only in this instance but in the future. Telephone companies have been occupying the highways fn Ne - braska under our laws for a great many years. They have chosen </seg>

This privilege by the telephone company has been njoyed for years and now that the transmission lines have been ven the right by law to use one side of the highway some of the lephone companies are attempting to put an undue amount of ex - ense upon transmission lines by claiming induction and interfer - nce with their lines. It is incumbent upon the telephone companies, here such conditions exist, to make their lines metallic and so nstruct them as much as possible to obviate this interference, fhile it is some expense to these telephone companies to have to ake this change, yet they have for years enjoyed the income from leap construction and they should now, wherever it is necessary, construct their lines to meet the necessities of the present day nd present conditions. This telephone line from Auburn to Brown- He is nowhere near as important and heavy a lead as hundreds of ines in Nebraska which are paralleled by high voltage transmission nes on the opposite side of the highway. *The Lincoln Telephone Telegraph company has. Itself, several parallels that are as im - ortant as this one leading from Auburn to Brownville and it did ot resist the construction of the lines so far as had come to my nowledge. The Continental Gas A Electric company is constructing nes parallel with the main leads of the toll lines of the A. T. T. company, the Northwestern Bell Telephone company. The incoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph company, and the Western Union here the parallel is for a very much greater distance, where the ads are very much heavier, where the messages over the lines re probably several times more in number and importance, and here there has been interference, if any, it has been quickly remedied and can be completely cured if the telephone and telegraph com - anies construct their lines as they should be to overcome these ecessities. The very statement that Mr. Wheeler made on Novem - »er 8, which has been quoted from the transcript of testimony, is dicative of the fact that if the transmission company, which makes his application, will rebuild and make their farm lines metallic hey will withdraw their objection. t According to the prepared order "the telephone company has mated that It will cost $3,923 to make all the farm lines metallic, uding the branches, and $2,685 to metallize the lines throughout parallel only." By way of passing it is interesting to note these </seg>
            <seg id="p295">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 295 figures. There is no evidence in the record whatsoever about the cost of metallizing these lines. The figures set forth in the opinion are not in the evidence, but were furnished by the telephone com - pany's engineer and have not been checked by the Commission's engineer as to their correctness. The commissioner has been advised by the engineer of the Commission that the cost of metallizing the parallel lines in an adequate manner to care for all probable diffi - culty would not be more than $1,000 or $1,200. Here, again, the conflicting estimates between the complainant telephone company and the Commission's disinterested engineer ought to be resolved in favor of the Commission's engineer, and certainly the suggestion that a minor investment of $1,000 or even of $3,000 is sufficient to justify a rate increase for the telephone company is going farther than I can go. This Commission has repeatedly announced that it is the duty of the telephone companies to maintain their lines in first class mechanical condition. The decisions of other states and of this Commission make it clear that it is the duty of the telephone company to metallize its telephone lines whenever that is reason - ably necessary to avoid interference. We shall not subscribe to any policy of permitting rate increases coincident with every minor repair of the telephone company. A suggestion of the telephone com - pany that "if the power company would pay for the cost of metallizing the telephone lines they would withdraw opposition to the trans - misHion line," is in our opinion an admission of the telephone company that the primary basis of opposition to this transmission line is the additional expense entailed upon the telephone company and that the so-called "Inductive interference" plea of the tele - phone company is not to be taken seriously. But we think that the duty of metallizing their telephone lines is one which in law and in justice they must bear, and this is especially true when it is con - sidered that the schedule of rates of the telephone company are adequate to absorb this improvement and that if they were not they could be readjusted, providing the telephone company is not now receiving adequate returns on its investment by present rate charges. We think there are two matters which are overlooled in the opinion and order. It does not take into account the Importance of the development of power transmission lines which will take place in Nebraska within the next few years. The decision of the Coin - mission in this case to the effect that wherever a telephone company occupies one side of a highway with important telephone lines that the power company must seek other roads, in our opinion will stifle the development of electric power distribution and is likely to handi - cap its development for years to come. There is hardly a road of any consequence in the state that is not occupied by telephone lines of more or less importance. It Is estimated that sixty-five per cent of the people live upon or adjacent to the state highway systems. </seg>
            <seg id="p296">296 SEVENTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT In the vast majority of cases the telephone's Important line am lo - cated on the state highways. If these estimates are accurate and the proposed opinion and order is correct, then it will be impossible to serve a vast majority of the people of the state with high voltage transmission lines. What la the purpose of the legislature authoris - ing farmers to join together and organize transmission line districts? What is the purpose of the statutes of the state authorizing one side of a highway cleared to give a power line right-of-way, if the decisions of this Commission should throttle the development of the power Industry by declaring that the telephone companies have a monopoly on the public highways of the state, and that the power company cannot distribute down the same highway without the consent of the telephone company, as well as the consent of this Commission? Our Impression is that any decision founded on this principle is flying In the face of public opinion and a necessary economic development: that it is bound to be reversed by statutory law and public usage and therefore we shall not subscribe to it. The proposed order discusses another important matter in a most interesting fashion. It says in substance: "No one knows how wide the alternative route proposed may be, nor does any one know where the proposed line along the side of this road may be, but we do not think this is serious and the power company can build its lines and trust to luck that it does not have to move them." We think this an injustice to the applicant company, and that the irregularity of the boundary line along the alternative, or south highway in this case, is sufficient to justify a declaration that the •outh highway is not a reasonable alternative route. We believe It la an Injustice to any company to ask it to make investments of from 920,000 to 130,000 based on an irregular property line with indefinite lights of which it is liable to be deprived by process of law at any time. We see no reason why it should be compelled to undergo the prospective damage suits and injunction proceedings in an effort to construct this line. After considering the entire subject matter from the testimony of all witnesses and from personal observation it is my judgment that the decision rendered and order issued by the Commission in the case, hearing on which was had on August 8, 1923, should be modified, per - mitting the applicant to use either highway which in its discretion would serve Its purpose best. </seg>

Burlington and Quincy Railroad Company requesting authority to publish changes in switching tariff between Omaha and South Omaha on the one hand and Ralston on the other; and Informal Complaint of A. J. England against the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad Company as to unsatisfactory switching arrangements at Ralston. Appearances For the applicant and defendant, J. B. Driggs, assistant general freight agent. For the complainant, J. A. Kuhn, Omaha Grain Exchange, N. Parsons, Omaha Hay Exchange, J. C. Suttle, Omaha Hay Exchange, A. J. England, Ralston, R. A. Crabbs, Ralston. For the Commission, J. A. Little, rate expert. STATEMENT BY THE COMMISSION: This informal complaint and application were heard together. We will treat the application first. Hereafter in these findings where we mention Omaha in connection with Burlington rates or shipments, we are to be understood as considering South Omaha and Omaha, as one station. Ralston is located about four miles southwest of the city limits of Greater Omaha and Is served by the Burlington and Missouri Pacific Railway companies. The station on the Missouri Pacific is known as "Seymour Park." Sometime during the period of federal control the Burlington established switching rates between Omaha and Ralston on "all car - load freight" from connecting lines in Omaha on road haul and in - terterminal traffic. No switching rates were published on Burlington intraterminal shipments. The Missouri Pacific Railway now, and for many years last past ha # s published switching rates between South Omaha and Omaha and Seymour Park (Ralston) on all carload traffic. The applicant herein asks the authority of the Commission to change its switching tariff between Omaha, South Omaha, and Ralston as follows: (a) that the rates apply to certain industries, instead </seg>
            <seg id="p302">302 of to "all carload freight"; (b) to provide that the switching rates will not apply on carload shipments of grain and grain products, and (c) that the rates on interterminal shipments shall also apply on shipments between Ralston and industries located on Rurlington racks in Omaha. The record Is not very clear as to the facts relied on by the applicant in support of the application. The purpose stated in the request for authority, "is to adapt our switching arrangements to conditions as they actually exist today." We assume this language refers to the naming of industries at Ralston instead of making the rates to apply on all carload traffic Subsequent to the hearing, and at the request of the Commission, a statement was filed by the applicant showing by commodities the otal number of carloads received at and forwarded from Ralston in road haul and switching services during the calender years 1921 o 1923 inclusive. This tabulation shows the following summary: A large highway paving Job was constructed by brick and san shipped into Ralston in 1923; out of the total of 915 cars received 1 said year about three hundred cars were used in connection with tl paving job just mentioned. The major portion of the carloads handled by the applicant at ftalston under normal traffic conditions consists of livestock and grain. Two hundred and thirty-five (235) out of the total of two hundred and seventy-seven i 277 I carloads forwarded during 1923, were hogs, sheep and cattle, eleven cars of wheat, fourteen of stoves. and seventeen cars of miscellaneous freight. The cars received in 1923 in a combined summary show as follows: As shown above the business handled was much heavier in 1923 than in the years 1922 and 1921, road building material excluded. For the purpose of this case we will assume that said year 1923 is representative of the traffic handled by the applicant at Ralston under present conditions. oreanl ierelv 923 922 921 277 198 90 915 396 308 Road building materials Other building material Litfestock Grain and grain products Hay and straw Coal and coke Miscellaneous ..£91 40 .317 . 96 .. 46 .. 51 _ 67 • </seg>
            <seg id="p303">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 303 The above summary clearly shows, that the handling and feed - ing of livestock at Ralston is by far the largest general industry using the facilities of the applicant at that station. The applicant requests our authority to cancel the present switching rate of 1 % cents per cwt. on carload shipments of grain and grain products between the tracks of connecting carriers in Omaha and Ralston. The present rate on corn between Ralston and Omaha for Burlington or any connecting line delivery In Omaha is six cents per cwt. This rate was established by the Commission in an order made and entered June 21, 1923. A thorough investigation of the grain rate adjustment in the eastern part of the state was made at that time. Ralston is in close competition for grain shipped from Papillion. At the present time a shipper can load a car of eighty thousand (80.000) pounds of corn, or any other commodity, on a I'nion Pacific industry track in Omaha and hare the same switched to Ralston ria the Burlington for a total charge of $13.05. If the same ship - ment was made from a Burlington industry track the charges would tw $48.00. This situation should and must be corrected. Ralston as originally laid out was intended to be a manufactur - ing town and was generally considered as a part of Omaha. Several fair sized manufacturing concerns are now doing business there. The existing manufacturing interests located at Ralston must be given consideration in the adjustment of switching rates between Omaha and Ralston. But as heretofore stated, the major portion of the business handled by applicant at Ralston is related to the livestock business and the rates must be adjusted so that the livestock feeders are properly related to other traffic handled at Ralston. In late years there has grown up in the country surrounding Omaha a very general livestock feeding business. Some of the rail - roads serving this territory, have established special commodity rates on livestock and grain shipped from the Omaha markets to feeders in this locality. Apparently this method of taking care of the traffic is satisfactory to the shippers inasmuch as the Commission has not been called upon to review the rates so established. After careful consideration of all of the facts of record in this case we are of the opinion and so find that the application as made should be denied. We further find that the present switching rates established by the applicant between Ralston and Omaha are not properly adjusted and should be revised. We will not enter order in this case at this time but will expect the Burlington to give further consideration to the switching rates between Omaha and Ralston </seg>
            <seg id="p304">304 and within thirty days from the date of these findings present for the approval of the Commission new and other rates than those men - tioned in the application herein denied. Consideration should be given to the Missouri Pacific switching rates now In effect between Omaha and Seymour Park. It may be the Missouri Pacific Railway should be made a party to these proceedings. Regarding the informal complaint that was heard in these proceedings, the complainant shows; that he bought a car of hay that originated at Stuart, a point on the C. ft N. W. Railway; that said car was delivered to the Burlington by the North Western at Omaha or delivery to the complainant at Ralston; that the C. B. ft Q. larged the legal rate in effect on hay between Omaha and Ralston; tat the Burlington refused to handle the car of hay in switch service t the published switching rate between Omaha and Ralston: that ecause said Burlington railroad refused to apply the switching rates n the shipment complained of the North Western Railway would ot absorb any part of the transportation charges from Omaha to alston. kThe C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. switching tariff No. 26-E on file with the mmission and in effect at the time the shipment in question moved, m No. 8 reads as follows: "Unless otherwise specifically provided, C. B. &amp; Q. R. R.. P. ft I. R. R. and Q. O. ft K. C. R. R. will not permit delivery of cars on its public team tracks or sidings except where the C. B. ft Q. R. R., P. ft I. R. R. and Q. O. &amp; K.

R.. P. &amp; I. R. R. and Q. O. ft K. C. R. R. performs a road haul service on such can from the originating stations.' 1 Under the provisions of the above quoted rule it appears that the charges have been correctly assessed on the car of hay received at Ralston by the complainant. The complaint will be dismissed. tThe reasonableness of the above quoted rule has not been con - ered by the Commission and we do not want to be understood as ing our approval to said rule in this opinion. An order will b« ered In accordance with these findings.

BY THE COMMISSION: This matter came on to be heard on the application of the Central Power company of Grand Island, Nebraska, for authority to con - struct, operate and maintain certain transmission lines in the vicinity of Paddock in Merrick county. Applicant is engaged in the generation, transmission and sale of electric energy to the public, and has applied to this Commission for authority to construct, operate and maintain transmission lines, to be operated aa sixty cycle, three phase alternat - ing current lines, having a potential of approximately 2,300 volts between wires. The line will connect with an existing transmission line owned and operated by applicant and will supply farm residences in the vicinity of Paddock with electric energy for light and power purposes. </seg>
            <seg id="p306">306 t Petitioner was unable to secure written agreements with all of parties at interest and the matter was heard by the Commission its offices in Lincoln, December 6, 1923. Applicant filed a map showing the location of the transmission ine by legal subdivisions and specifications which describe the manner of its construction. The proposed construction will consist of the erec - ion of additional wires on an existing transmission line owned by applicant in the neighborhood of Paddock, for a distance of about wo miles, and the construction of branch lines which will extend to farm residences in that locality. The owners of existing electric lines which may be affected by he proposed construction and operation of the transmission line are the Northwestern Bell Telephone company, the Union Pacific Rail - road company, the Western Union Telegraph company and the Postal Telegraph £ Cable company. Applicant has filed a written agreement with the Northwestern Bell Telephone company and the Postal Tele - ;raph and Cable company did not appear at the hearing to protest. The failure to secure written agreements with the railroad and tele - graph companies was partly due to a lack of cooperation between the parties and to a misunderstanding of the extent and character of applicant's construction. The Commission finds that applicant has complied with the law and that the prayer of its petition should be granted, subject to the terms and conditions of the written agreement with the telephone com - pany and transmission line rules adopted by this Commission and effective September 5, 1919. The Commission further finds that six months from the date of this order is a reasonable length of time in which to complete the proposed construction. The Commission will retain its jurisdiction over the service on the signal circuits involved in the parallel created by the proposed construction, and in the event that the service on these lines is inter - fered with by prolonged inductive interference resulting from the construction and operation of the proposed transmission line, the parties at interest may apply to the Commission for relief as pro - vided by statute. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission, pursuant to the provisions of the transmission line laws of Nebraska, as amended to date, that the Central Power company of Grand Island, Nebraska, be, and the same is hereby permitted to construct, operate and maintain the transmission line described in the </seg>

C. Steele and family Ohiowa, who made this application chiefly that they might realize a fair return upon an amount In closer measure with the present value of the properties. In the previous order of the Commission referred to above, applicant was permitted to pay eight per cent dividends upon $13,500.00. Since that time, considerable value has been added to the property through additions and betterments, the principal and largest increase being property acquired from the Continental Gas &amp; Electric company of Omaha. The acquisition of this property came about through contract &gt;etween applicant company and the Continental Gas &amp; Electric ompany. The transmission company, in entering this territory, ound it necessary to parallel farm lines of the applicant for a pon - derable distance, and agreed by contract that in event the trans - ission line caused trouble in the transmission of messages over the lephone lines, that they (the Continental Gas &amp; Electric company) their own expense would convert all telephone lines so paralleled nto metallic circuits. This was found later to be necessary. The otal cost of this reconstruction by the gas company amounted to 2,483.55. In addition to this cost, applicant furnished new poles in te amount of $91.90. Testimony at the hearing failed to develop he exact net Increase in property value because of this acquired roperty. The property which this construction displaced was largely reinstalled into the plant in advantageous positions. Undoubtedly a arge part of this construction should be considered as additions to te plant.

We have no reason to question this increase and be - lieve it to fairly represent actual additions and betterments. Further item to be considered is new cable construction which is to be done in the city. Applicant estimated this cost at $331.00. The itemized statement offered the Commission in support of this estimate seems reasonable. The total of the amounts just enumerated is $3,750.25 which, if taken in the gross amount and added to the figure found by the Commission for dividend purposes in its order of January 13, 1921, would bring the total to $17,250.00. We believe some allowance should be made for possible account - ing errors in the matter of the property acquired from the Continental (las &amp; Electric company: therefore, the Commission believes and so finds that $17,000.00 is a fair measure of Investments in applicants property useful in the conduct of its business and upon which applicant is entitled to a return. Testimony developed that many items of personal expense of the owner were paid with company funds. It was likewise shown that in some instances expenses were incurred personally to the owner which were not compensated by the company. The Commission believes it unnecessary to go into the details of these numerous small items, of which there are many, and which are hopelessly intermingled with the company's accounts. The Commission does, however, dis - approve of this method of accounting, and as a condition to this order will require applicant to submit monthly reports, under di - rection of the accounting department of the Commission, made in sufficient detail to permit thorough analysis of all accounts pertaining to operating expenses.

Testimony in compensation (or not more than who also operates an undertaking The central office building is used jointly by the telephone com - pany as central office and by the manager as a residence. Allowance for the rental value of that portion of the building used for residence purposes should be made and we find $120.00 per annum as carried on the books of the company at this time to be reasonable and therefore will give the item the same consideration in this order. This amount is included in the manager's salary in the expense table above and also in the gross revenue figure following. The maintenance and depreciation allowance is based up&lt; per cent of the fixed Investment of applicant, after considering new construction contemplated. The operating statements of applicant tend to show that this amount should be sufficient under ordinary conditions to fully cover current maintenance ant preciation. The above total of expenses, when applied revenues from all sources, in the amount of $7,091.64, results in • deficit of $146.66. It follows, therefore, that add should be provided to absorb this deficit The rate schedule now collected by applicant does i ffer entiate between grounded farm service and metallic residence parry service. There should be a spread between these two elaaai service which, if adjusted, would necessarily call for an adjustment of the metallic individual residence service rate. The present busi - ness rate is somewhat lower than ordinarily charged for like service and in the same localities. Hence, further adjustment also should be made affecting this class of service. By permitting a raise in rates on residence stations of 15 cents per month and 25 cents per month on business stations, additional revenue in the amount of $202.20 would be realized. </seg>

SUPPLEMENTAL OPINION AND FINDING RANDALL, Commissioner tThe original order in this case was effective April 1, 1924. but it date was extended in order that we might make further studies. th particular reference to the valuation used by us In the original ler. The valuation of the properties was found in the original order as $17,000. This was bottomed upon the historical connection of his case with preceding cases which early cases carried an error. Early in 1919 the Commission found a valuation of $12,400 for rate urposes basing this valuation upon the dollars originally put in »y the first builders plus stock sold and money borrowed after that ate. The supreme court of Nebraska decided adversely to this method. The Commission had therefore to readjust its rules for nding fair value. In August, 1917, the Commission's engineering department found be original construction cost of the property as of that date to &gt;e $24,637 and its present value based on the original cost $16,484. 'he books of the company have been kept since 1919 in accordance with the standard rules promulgated by the Commission and these &gt;ooks have been carefully audited by the Commission's accounting epartment from time to time. Certain construction work amounting o $1,383 has been paid for since that date out of net earnings. The ompany acquired property from the Nebraska Gas ft Electric com - pany in amount $2,483. Although the testimony indicates that no property was lost in the reconstruction done by the electric com - pany, it seems improbable that this was fully correct. The records how that the property has been kept in approximately the condi - lon It was in In 1917 by replacements and reconstruction. We find therefore that the present fair value of the property Is not less than $20,000 and we will use that figure as a basis on which he company is entitled if it can, to earn a fair return and that fair return we find under present circumstances to be eight per cent. This fair value is to be understood as including reasonable work - ng capital. Uln the original finding in this matter, the Commission estimated nual expenses and authorized rates to meet the requirements so </seg>
            <seg id="p313">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 313 found. Informally applicant has objected to certain of those esti - mates, particular reference to the estimate of salary for officers, alleging that this is not an adequate measure when compared with the pay for like services in like companies. This informal objec - tion is based on a misapprehension of the original order. It should be understood that the estimate which was used in part in arriving at the level of the rates wag merely compensation for managerial and bookkeeping services and did not include any work of maintenance or replacements of property done by the manager. An estimate was made of the necessary funds to keep the property in good working condition. To that account set up on a monthly basis is charged under the accounting rules, both labor and materials for work done on the property itself. It makes no difference whether this is done by the owner or someone else. The evidence showed that the man - ager-owner does considerable work of that nature and it was not intended that charges for such work should not be made against the monthly portion of revenues set aside to meet that expense. Further consideration of the amount designated by the Com - mission and carried in the order as a requirement to take care of maintenance indicates that it is probably sufficient and the estimate will not be changed. The other estimates of expenses were made with full consideration of certain irregular handling of the business of the company and its intermingling with the private business of the manager. It must be understood that the Commission has not limited the total pay of the manager any more than it has by setting up an estimate of probable experience, attempted to fix the wages of other employees. The company is obligated by law to operate economically and it cannot be said in advance of experience just what the neces - sities will be nor can it be said in advance how much the total com - pensation of the manager-owner ought to be. It is dependent upon the time devoted to the company's business. The Commission has however, not proposed revenues sufficient to pay more for strictly managerial duties than was designated in the estimate. Since however the manager lives in the building immediately adjacent to the central office in order to be in touch with the duties of the company during hours when otherwise he might not so closely supervise, we believe on further consideration that the rental paid as indicated in the original order should be offset by an estimate of managerial and secretarial expense, that much higher than our original estimate. In other words we put the estimate for clerical and managerial duties at $1,320. No other changes in the estimate appear essential after further consideration.

Appearan For applicant, V. E. Wilson, attorney; Chas. A. Patterson, ■cretary. For respondents, O. E. Bozarth, attorney. OPINION AM) FINDING BROWNE. Chairman This application was filed with the Commission October 30, 192S, alleging serious financial embarrassment and necessity for relief and asking authority to advance rates and charges for telephone service in accordance with a proposed scheme. Hearing was held at Arapahoe December 17 and the case taken under advisement upon condi - tion that the Commission would serve upon the company a ques - tionnaire, from the answers to which it would figure out the cost switching service. The computations on this service would be m rwd on counsel for respondents and opportunity would be given, on motion by him, for further hearing. This questionnaire was prepared, filled out by the company, and computations made by the Commission's accountants and served on counsel for respondents on January 30. No word has been received ni him as to desire for further hearing iln tiling of this application the Commission issued an order on Application No. 5126, (16 N. S. R. C. 318-321) wherein the company desired authority to sell additional stock to pay for an extensive improvement program. In that case we found the fair value of the company's property to be $27,500. Applicant operates an exchange serving 366 subscribers and furnishing switching service to 138 subscribers, whose distribution property is independently owned. It owns half interest in toll lines Arapahoe to Beaver City, Arapahoe to Edison, and Arapahoe to Holbrook. Its property is entirely metallic. In 1922 a serious sleet storm almost destroyed the distribution system. Since that date the company has spent more than $10,000 in reconstruction. It has built an exchange building of modest proportions, but substantially planned. It has cabled its town plant and removed pole lines from the main streets to alleys. The expense of this improvement and reconstruction program was partly borne by accumulation of cash, brought about from surpluses and the setting aside of earned divi- </seg>

Its subsequent history and methods of financing hare been well set out in our findings on Application No. 5126 supra and need not be repeated here. It is sufficient to say that until 1920 it was a prosperous venture for those who invested In it, although the rates which resulted in this prosperity were relatively not high. It has been well managed. Its original stock was sold at large discounts. All local people had an opportunity to invest and were urged to invest. Many who did then Invest later sold their stock until now the property is held by about forty stockholders. The rates now being charged are those originally established. Strained financial results, due to the higher costs of labor and materials since the war, reached the breaking point as a result of the disas - trous sleet storm and the necessity of investing large amounts of new capital. The company owes $7,500 on short-time notes at local banks, bearing eight per cent interest. It owed no debts prior to the sleet storm. The present and proposed rates are as follow Note: The proposed toll rates are station to station and person to person. The company sets forth its present maximum revenues as follows: City subscribers Rural subscribers Switching service Toll earnings 1,187.64 128 70 Misc ellaneous Total $6,897.48 " I2.872.6S per annum 2.292.36 " 416.10 " Present Propose*!

            <seg id="p317">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 317 It estimates that the proposed rates would increase these earn - ings $2,270. or thirty-three per cent. The company estimates its expenditures on the basis of the 1923 experience, adjusted to permit a fair return on the value here - tofore found by us, as follows: In other words, the company alleges that under its present rate schedule if its property is properly protected by maintenance and provision for replacements there would be nothing left with which to pay taxes and interest, let alone a dividend. In 1922 the company's revenues fell off very materially, due to the extensive destruction of its plant. This loss was not entirely recovered at the time of the hearing. The 1923 revenues were actually less than will be the 1924 revenues. This was recognized in the company's computations, but we think not quite sufficiently. The company's exhibit of expenses for 1923 includes the special expense of a valuation of its properties and attorney's fees in two hearings. These are not a proper measure of next year's commercial expenses. We find that the company may reasonably expect from its pro - posed rates a revenue of $9,300 in 1924 if applied throughout the year. We find also that its reasonable expenditures, including a re - turn of eight per cent on the present value of its properties, out of which return it must pay all interest charges, will be $9,100. The objection registered at the hearing to the company's pro - posed rates was from those independent companies purchasing switch - ing service. These companies have always enjoyed a rate of $3.00 per station per year. This rate was the quite universal rate in the early days of telephone companies. For years we hare been unable to justify the rate upon any basis of cost. From the company's reports to the Commission, in accordance with the uniform rules of accounting prescribed by us, and from answers to a special ques - tionnaire the Commission's accountants have computed a cost of switch - ing service per subscriber of $8.41 per annum. The entire detail of these computations has been submitted to counsel for subscribers. We think that some Items of cost, such as management, book- Maintenance and depreciation $2,940.00 Traffic expenses 1,620.60 Commercial expenses 2,437.59 Taxes 228.00 Return, including interest 2,200.00 Total $9,435.19 Deficit under present rates $2,537.71 </seg>
            <seg id="p318">318 SEVENTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT leeping, and switchboard cost and upkeep, were erroneously spread evenly among all subscribers, including those switched. We have readjusted the computations so that officers' salaries, bookkeeping and collecting, stationery and printing, and the maintenance and re - turn on the switchboard should be considered differently as applied to ■witched lines and to regular subscribers. Such items as operators salaries, heat, light and power are caused approximately equally by ill subscribers. No special study is being made to cover ihe volume of business from any one telephone as compared with another. With these adjustments we find the cost of switching i-a&lt; h sub - scriber by the Arapahoe Telephone company to be $6.t(8 per annum. The cost of the same items of expense to the company's own sub - scribers we find to be $9.67. Thus, we find it necessary to approve the switching charges prayed for. It might also be said here that in recent years we have in no instance found that cost to In- under forty cents per month, the variation being largely due to the level of pay of operators. No criticism was expressed at the hearing to the wages being paid operator! by this iiinipany We thus find that the company is legally entitl following schedule of rate* for exchange ser\ ; Business.

This company owns no property beyond the city limits. It was proposed that these stations pay the present rate plus the actual maintenance on same during the year. This additional revenue is estimated by applicant at $100 per year. The Commission in its order of August 20, 1921. under Application No. 4450, Included the following note with the revised rate schedule: "The above rates are applicable to those subscribers who own their own instruments, it being understood that the company is responsible for all maintenance charges. Furthermore, that the company agrees to purchase such instruments from all such subscribers who desire to sell same, at any reasonable figure that may be agreed upon." In view of the previous finding of the Commission as relates to the privately owned city stations we shall consider all city stations as one class and the rates herein found eqitable will be applied ac cordingly. The history of this company has been very obscure until recent years, due to lack of proper bookkeeping methods. The company has been a privately owned concern for many years and has apparently been operated in a very economical manner and the service is very satisfactory to the patrons. We find no available information sufficiently reliable upon which we might reach a definite conclusion as to the fair value of the applicant's property.

            <seg id="p325">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 325 in 1911, from data submitted by the manager of the company at that time, found an original cost figure of approximately $2,600. At that time the company operated only twenty-six stations within the city limits, while at the present time it operates one hundred twenty - nine, twenty-eight of which are owned by the patrons. We find further that a new switchboard and central office equipment have been purchased since that time, which would further add to the ▼alue of the property. It would seem therefore that the growth of the company since that time would justify an amount of $5000 for dividend purposes. For the purpose of this order, therefore, we find an amount of $5,000 upon which the applicant will be entitled to pay a return, but which is not intended to represent fair value because the record is not complete. The accounts of the company since 1920 hare been kept in con - formity with the system of accounts provided by the Commission and should fairly represent the actual financial operations of the company during the period. The statements of the applicant have been reviewed for the years 1919 to 1923, Inclusive, for the purpose of finding past average operating expenses. By applying certain revisions to these averages, which testimony proved necessary, we find the following expense statement which will be used for the purposes of this finding: Maintenance and depreciation $ 800.00 Operators' wages 1,080.00 The total expense found above, in the amount of $4,158.87, when applied to the present gross revenue of $4,045.39, results In a deficit of $113.48. While it is very clear that the application in part should be denied, it is necessary that additional revenue should be provided to absorb this deficit. We find that the cost of furnishing switching service to farm patrons is $5.63 per year per station.

            <seg id="p329">329 OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE. Chairman This application U for the purpose of securing proper authoriza - tion for such portions of amended train service as fall within the Jurisdiction of this Commission. Applicant purposes the following changes: Train No. 21, which now leaves Lincoln at 6:00 p. m. and arrives at Wymore at 9:25 p. m. and train No. 20, which leaves Wymore at 6:45 a. m. and arrives at Lincoln at 10:15 a. m., shall be abandoned. That portion of the service between Lincoln and Table Rock shall be taken care of by a new train of better equipment, leaving Lincoln at 4:16 p. m., making local stops to Table Rock and having destination at St. Louis. With returning service leaving St. Joseph, Missouri, at 7:35 a. m. and arriving at Lincoln at 11:55 a. m.. these trains to include Sundays where now no Sunday service is offered. The utilization of the mileage of Nos. 20 and 21 between Lincoln and Table Rock in this through service leaves the problem of train service to be adjusted between Table Rock and Wymore. Patrons between Lincoln and Table Rock are not particularly interested. The only effect of the new service is to make the period between trains at Lincoln for round-trip service in one day consider - ably shorter than heretofore, but it does add Sunday service. It is perfectly clear that in addition to other trains operating between Lincoln and Table Rock the new train will perform the same service that is now being performed by trains Nos. 20 and 21 and the mileage of those trains would be plain duplication without merit. We must, therefore, approve the elimination of the trains mentioned between these points. Such action leaves to be considered the train service between Wymore and Table Rock. Four propositions are presented in testi - mony: (a) to abandon the service entirely on the score that it la not used enough to warrant continuance; (b) to operate a stub train between Wymore and Table Rock, making connections with this new train to St. Louis; (c) to operate trains Nos. 7 and 24 now running between Wymore and Lincoln by way of Crete and Beatrice so that the runs will terminate at Lincoln and Table Rock in place of at Lincoln and Wymore; and (d) to substitute a motor car for the steam train and make connections at Table Rock with the St. Louis train. Several years ago service was furnished to passengers between Lincoln and Table Rock on trains Nos. 119 and 120, popularly known as "The Irish Mail." These trains ran at somewhat the same time of the day as the trains in question, Nos. 20 and 21, except that the </seg>
            <seg id="p330">330 predecessor trains were mixed and handled livestock, as well as pas - sengers. Complaint was filed by Senator J. D. Barr and citizens of Liberty, alleging chiefly inability of the patrons of the Burlington at towns between Wymore and Table Rock to get service to the capital city and return in the same day. constituting a serious inconvenience and standing as a permanent barrier to the development of a passenger business which promised much. After a hearing on the complaint the Commission entered an order embodying the terms of a stipulation by which the Burlington undertook to substitute passenger trains for the "Irish Mail" and to terminate these trains at Wymore In place of at Table Rock. The service was inaugurated May 30, 192O. Under the present arrangement there is not only available round-trip service to Lincoln in one day, but citizens at Armour, Burchard and Violet are able to secure very agreeable passenger train service to the county seat and back in one day. Citizens of Liberty and Kinney, in Gage county, were not thus benefited. Their facilities to go east and return in service to Lincoln. benefit consisted largely of better one day, as well as the round-trip The new train has not developed the business that w pated. A record of two months pr train showed an average number Pawnee City and Wymore to Lincoln of 4.7 per day. A check of three months' business in the fall of 1!'L':'. shows the average traffi stance. A study of the months April, J A cates that between Lincoln and Table Rock than 21 passengers per train mile, that is. an averag the train at all times. Between Table Rock and Wymor average was only 4% passengers. From passenger traffi earned better than 7 5 cents per train mile between Lincoln and Ta Rock, off-setting the extremely poor showing of It between Table Rock and Wymore. However, that off-set can no longer be made as those passengers will be carried on other trains. Our consideration must be confined to the traffic between Table Rock and Wymore. The trains do not carry mail and carry a very small amount of express. The total earnings, then, as indicated by the three months' study for each train mile operated are less than the usual charge for operating an automobile in livery service an equivalent distance. It is clear enough this train does not, and probably its substitute cannot, earn even approaching out of pocket cost of operation. How- 4 of one passenger per day. This excludes any increase in local traffic. This Commission has in the past decade considered many branch line train cases.

We must consider the necessity of the train. pay out le out of pocket cost of operating a shuttle train between Wy - nd Table Rock to connect with the new St. Louis train would per month and the earnings apparently not to exceed h a train is out of the question and is dismissed as one of t^ alternatives. Representatives of the towns affected would i&gt;&lt; bo satisfied if trains Nos. 7 and 24. now operating between Lincoln and Wymore. should extend to terminate at Table Rock, giving service to city in the reverse direction from that now given. It inate the present inter-town service to the county seat of V Pawnee county and would substitute service to the county seat of Gage county from two towns which do not now have it by train round-trip y In a three months' period the total number of tickets sold at the towns chiefly concerned to Lincoln and to points between Table Lincoln were 6.4 per day and the returning movement able Rock to the four towns was 5.1. The difference Is due to the fact that afternoon service is available from own.- to Lincoln and intermediate points on other trains, urning service the same day is not available without ex- ve waits. It would appear, therefore, that the maximum number ersons who could desire to journey beyond Table Rock in the tion of Lincoln and return the same day does not exceed five. There is additional to this the local patronage which would be A ten-day study was made of this patronage.

POORKST DAY: F.n.st hound: One passenger Wymore to Liberty, none from Liberty to Burchard, one Burchard to Table Rock West bound: Four passengers Table Rock to Pawnee, two from Pawnee to Liberty, one from Liberty to Wymore. It thus appears that the local traffic is very light. Our main consideration must, therefore, be given to the necessity of round-trip service to Lincoln from the four towns in question. As before stated, this is a maximum requirement of five passengers per day. Un- </seg>

Excellent service Is provided tor those desiring to visit Omaha or Lincoln and not desiring to return the same day. This consists ot service on train No. 16. east bound, through the towns affected In this application in the early afternoon, making close connection with No 41 at Table Rock. The return movement the subsequent day would be by way ot Crete and Beatrice, making good connection at Wymore. This case is not the same as some branch line cases considered by the Commission where it is proposed to eliminate all-passenger train service and to substitute mixed trains. There are two passenger trains each way through the towns affected by this application, both serving Pawnee City. As already pointed out, the main difficulty is these trains do not run or make connections so as to give reason - able round-trip service to Lincoln in one day. The Burlington pro - poses to stop the fast train No. 14 at Liberty and Burchard if that service Is demanded and needed. question exists that the operation of the present schedules, service in reverse direction through Beatrice and Crete to Lin - coln, is highly convenient and the evidence is also ample that that convenience applies to very few persons. It is more a potential Ivenience than an actual one so far as the communities are con - aed and the question we must now answer ia shall a service be intalned to furnish the potential convenience of round-trip service the capital and metropolis in one day where that service Is not d sufficiently to even approximate out of pocket costs of offering service.

In the Matter of the Application of the Chicago ft North Western Railway Company for Authority to Close Two Stations at Martland and Carlisle, Nebraska. Appearances: For applicant, Robert D.

OPINION AND FINDINU RANDALL, Commissioner: This application by the Chicago ft North Western Railway com - pany for the discontinuance of the agents at the towns of Carlisle and Martland on the Superior branch was heard in the Commission's offices at Lincoln on January 3, 1924. The stations of Carlisle and Martland were established at the time the railroad was built some thirty-five years ago. At that time there was prospect that these two stations might develop into towns of some proportion, sufficient to warrant the establishment of stations with agents and telegraph operators, but it seems from the testimony and also from actual conditions existing there that the company's anticipation has not been realized and that the stations never have furnished sufficient business to warrant the added expense of agents at these two points. The town of Davenport, where the company has a station and agent, is only 4.1 miles from Carlisle, and the town of Shickley, where the company maintains a station, with an agent, is 3.9 miles south of Martland. The close proximity of these towns to </seg>
            <seg id="p334">334 I' towns of Carlisle and Martland has taken so much of the business in these stations that the business has never gained such proportion was anticipated. A further contributing factor in the falling off business at these two stations is the state highways and the amount traffic that is being carried on by automobile and trucks. The town of Carlisle does not even have a postoffice, but is furnished rural mail delivery from Davenport. There is only one store at each of the two towns and there is no prospect of either town making any substantial growth or improvement in the way of busi- The testimony of the railway company shows that if a caretaker is substituted for an agent the expense at each station will be from tOOO to $1,200 a year less than it is at present.

It shows very plainly that the principal source of revenue at Carlisle and Martland was from carload lots, which could have been handled at Davenport and Shickley by the company's agents at those stations. The amount of business less than carload lot and ticket sales Is very insignificant aa compared with the expense of maintaining agents at those stations. It was clearly shown by the company that the expense of maintaining an agent at Martland was $1,739.61 and at Carlisle $1,748.50. Of this amount the salary of the agent was $1,272.96. The Chicago &amp; North Western Railway company made the propo- sition that if it were permitted to dispense with the services of an agent at these two stations it would employ a caretaker who would see to it that the depot was heated and lighted and about the only difference to the patrons of the two stations would be that it would necessitate the prepayment of freight and express to those stations by the shippers and that cars desired for the shipment of grain, live- stock, and other commodities would have to be ordered from the agent at Davenport for Carlisle and at Shickley for Martland and would have to be billed by those agents under the direction of the shippers. There was a large amount of testimony introduced by the resi- dents of both Carlisle and Martland and while the Commission under- </seg>
            <seg id="p337">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 337 stands their personal feeling In the matter there was no testimony Introduced that would justify the Commission in requiring the railway company to expend an unreasonable amount in the maintaining of those stations for such a small volume of business as was shown by the exhibits on file in the office of the Railway Commission and that were introduced in evidence and which have been copied into this It developed in the testimony that the railway company main - tained telephones In its offices that could be used by shippers In ordering cars and in obtaining other information in regard to ship - ments without expense to them. The telephones must be retained In both depots and the caretakers must send in their dally car reports to Davenport and Shlckley, as is done at the present time by the agents, showing empty cars on hand, cars loaded to go, and empty cars wanted. After duly considering all of the testimony the Commission finds that the application of the Chicago ft North Western Railway com - pany to discontinue the maintenance of agents at Carlisle and Mart - land and substitute caretakers therefor is reasonable and Just and should be granted. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway company be and the same is hereby authorized to discontinue the maintenance of agents at Carlisle and Hartland under the following conditions: The railway company shall at all times maintain caretakers at both stations who shall reside in the depot and be accessible so that shippers may be able to deliver both express and freight and receive both express and freight at the station; also, have access to the telephone for the purpose of ordering cars from the towns of Davenport and Shlckley without any expense to the shipper; that the depot shall be comfortably warmed during the months when heat is necessary for the comfort of the traveling public at least a half hour before the arrival of trains; stations shall be kept well lighted for use of passengers using trains that arrive at the towns after sundown; any freight left on the plat - form for out shipment shall be received by the caretaker and billing instructions from the shipper may be given to the caretaker when properly tagged and his receipt for the same shall be binding upon the company. The conductors will handle the freight and the baggage - men all baggage, express, cream, etc., as the case may be, and the freight will be billed from the next station and the baggagemen will make the waybills themselves.

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 6S78 rthe Matter of the Application of the Blair Telephone Company for Authority to Increase Its Capital Stock. TAYLOR, Commissioner In effect this is an application (or modification of an order issued y this Commission in Application No. 4113, but It has been docketed separately and will be so considered. In Application No. 4113, (13 . 8. R. C. 315-317) the Commisision authorized the Blair Telephone ompany to Issue stock in the amount of $36,700, of which $23,414 was for cash paid in at various times and the remainder for dividends earned but not paid. The new issue, added to the then outstanding Issue of $10,800, made a total capital issue of $47,600. This order was entered on March 5, 1920. Compliance with the order required n amendment to the articles of incorporation of the company. For lat reason and others the company has never issued the new stock. To have Issued the stock to the existing stockholders number - ing two-hundred and forty-one, with twenty-six shares additional in the treasury, would have required the issuance of fractional shares. This the company does not desire. It desires also to change the par value of the stock from $40 to $50 per share. In this application, therefore, it asks permission to issue a total of nine-hundred and aixty-four shares of its common stock at a par value of $50 per share. The articles of Incorporation hare been properly amended and notice of the same filed with the Commission. The plan as proposed by the company will increase the total outstanding issue by $700. It is </seg>
            <seg id="p341">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 341 proposed to Issue four new shares at $50 for every share of $40 par, requiring a pro rata cash payment aggregating $700. On November 30, 1923, the balance sheet of the company showed total assets of $87,310.88. Of this amount $77,412.46 was In fixed property. It is manifest, therefore, that the issue as proposed will still leave a wide margin between the outstanding stock and the un - depreciated assets of the company. The Commission found in the previous order that the present value of the physical property plus the working assets was approximately $47,401. Since that time ad - ditions and betterments have been made to the property so that its present or depreciated value on an original cost basis exceeds $50,000. There appears to be no reason, therefore, why the application of the company should not be approved. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the order Issued by this Commission in Application No. 4113 (13 N. S. R. C. 315-317) be modified so as to authorise the Blair Telephone Company to Issue its common stock in the amount of $37,400 instead of $36,700 as previously authorized, provided that the total outstanding Issue shall not exceed $48,200. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the par value of this stock be changed from $40 per share to $50 per share, and that the increase as herein provided for shall be paid for in cash by existing stock - holders on a pro rata basis.

Applicant represents of record that its revenues in 1923 at Whitney for exchange service were $1198.42 and that its expenses were $1640.66 leaving a deficit of $442.24 without any return on Investment. It estimates that under the proposed rates it will receive for exchange service $1706.61 and that its net earning! available for dividends will be $61.20. At Belmont, the company represents that its total revenues tor exchange service are $350.02, that its expenses are $1053.14, leaving I net deficit without return of $703.12. It estimates revenues under s proposed rates of $1030.90 and says that it will have a small licit without any returns on the investment under these rates. L Applicant represents that the gross cost of its property as carried the books is at Whitney, $6760.90 and at Belmont $599.30. Respondents laid special stress on the fact that in 1911 they ntered into a contract with applicant's predecessor, under which greed rates were to be charged. This same question was passed on y the Commission in 1918 and was considered again in 1919. The ontract was made after rates and service were under the Jurisdiction f the Commission and under the holding of the supreme court Marquis v. Polk County Telephone Company, 100 Nebr. 140) were made subject to amendment by the state. The rates have three lmes been amended since that contract was entered into. The expenses as set up by the company for the two exchanges re not taken directly from the books. Certain of the expenses are llocated under a formula whereas the books do not make these llocations of common expense by exchanges. Under the allocations he common expenses are spread without regard to whether they have teen correspondingly incurred by the exchanges. Under such a lvtslon of common expenses, few, if any, of the smaller exchanges f the company within the state will show proper, if any, net earnings. ' however at these two exchanges only the direct expenses are listed ogether with one-half the liberal set-up for depreciation used in the gures presented by the company, there Is but little left of the Whitney evenues for net return, and a considerable loss at the Belmont xchange. These facts are beyond controversey. I Not all telephone exchanges within a system can be operated at profit. Population distribution sometimes presents Insuperable </seg>
            <seg id="p345">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 345 obstacles to profitable operation within a very limited sphere. There are mistakes in Judgment in the location of exchanges and assumption! of future growth that do not materialize. Undoubtedly each exchange should be self supporting, if that can be accomplshed within the realm of reasonable rate*. It is obvious that both of these exchanges are too small to be operated at a profit, either by this company or by any other company, except they were organized on a mutual basis. The location of exchanges at Belmont and Whitney were originally mistakes. The subscribers at both points probably should have been served on party lines from Crawford and have been placed within a zone carrying common rates with Crawford and common service territory. The mistakes were here when applicant bought the property some five or six years ago and were known to the expert telephone men who made the purchase. The rates applied for at both Whitney and Belmont are higher than any other rates in western or northwestern Nebraska, regardless of the size of the exchange, or the extent of the service proffered. At Belmont at least the rates are higher than the traffic will bear as is shown by a statement of record from the vice-president of applicant company. The proposed service station rates at Whitney are almost three times as high as the highest present service station rates out - side of the Omaha territory. Applicant is faced by the consequences of mistakes of manage - ment in construction, mistakes which it Inherited with its purchase. This Commission could not, even if the prayer of the applications were for such remedy, authorize or order correction of the error, because applicant has not complied with the statutory requirement preliminary to abandonment of exchanges. If originally the patrons affected by these applications had been served from the Crawford switchboard the rates today would have been the Crawford rates and the service would have been the same for a zone which would have included Crawford, Belmont and Whitney. We find that rates now in effect for subscribers of the Crawford exchange are reasonable for subscribers at Whitney and Belmont and that for such rates free interchange with Crawford and between Belmont and Whitney should be afforded. We also find that equal free service in reverse direction should be given. These conclusions will embody increases in rates for business and residence service at Belmont without an increase in extent of service. They will embody increases of business and residence rates </seg>
            <seg id="p346">346 at Whitney, but will provide increased free service to Crawford and Belmont for residence and business subscribers at Whitney where now they pay toll rates. No increases will result on farm and switch - ing subscribers although an increase in service proffered will result to rural subscribers at Whitney. LThe record is not sufficient to show whether the rates found by to be reasonable will produce additional revenue. The maximum increase of exchange revenue will be approximately $100, but there will be some loss of toll revenue resulting from the increased free Krviee. Failure to secure net earnings under these rates will not be le to the level of the rates.

The purpose of the issue is to liquidate certain short-time notes ayable, owed to Lincoln banks and Lincoln citizens. Almost all of its Indebtedness arose from the fact that of a total bond issue f $1,500,000, $250,000 matured January 1, 1920, and to meet this bllgatlon the company borrowed on short-time notes chiefly from tockholders. These borrowings bear interest at seven and eight per ent and certain other borrowings from local banks bear interest at ten per cent. The company has from time to time purchased in the pen market small lots of bonds until at the present time it has pprozimately $300,000 of bonds, although most of these are de - oslted as collateral on the short-time notes which it is proposed o refund at this time. The refinancing submitted in this application in nowise increases he sum total of the liabilities. It does have the effect of stabilizing he Indebtedness for the next few years and gives the company a freer hand In Its banking obligations concurrent with operation. The proposed financing appears to clearly fall within the provision of the aw as being necessary for corporate purposes. It will be approved.

Commissioner: Applicant herein operates a telephone system at Bancroft, and geeks authority to increase rates of switching subscribers from twenty-five to fifty cents per month. Hearing was held on the matter at Bancroft, Pebruary 7, 1924. This company serves a total of 301 company-owned stations and switches four farmer companies, consisting of seven lines, whose com - bined stations total 88. </seg>
            <seg id="p352">352 While this application deals solely with switching rates and does not directly concern the rate structure as a whole, it is well to dls - us8 briefly the present net profits of the company in order that we may determine whether or not the increased revenue which might be realized under the proposed increase would net the applicant profits In excess of a fair return upon the present fair value of its property. Reports for the three months period ended December 31, 1923, have teen submitted by applicant and reflect economical and careful man - agement. The reports do not contain items of increase which should »e allowed for operators' wages and clerical work by the owner which &gt;as been done without compensation. The present allowance for main - tenance and depreciation is not adequate to permit the accumulation of a sufficient reserve for accrued depreciation and should be revised n finding the approximate net profits of applicant. When the above changes are made and the proposed increase of $264.00 per year is applied the results in net earnings could in no manner be said to represent an excessive return. Protestants, represented at this hearing, who objected to the proposed increase, submitted certain estimates purporting to show that the present switching rates the company was charging were adequate to pay operating costs related to switching subscribers service. The statements so submitted were partially estimated and not taken from the experiences of the company. It was admitted by the representa - tive of the protestants. upon direct examination, that the estimate submitted was subject to some changes which would tend to show that the company was now operating or switching its farm subscribers at a loss. The Commission, in its many investigations and studies of switch - ing costs, is not able to justify on a cost basis the rate now charged by this applicant, namely, twenty-five cents per month per switching subscriber. The accounting department of the Commission prepared a ques - tionnaire which was submitted to the applicant and which, when com - pleted, was intended to show the actual expense relating to switching costs. This questionnaire, together with the information contained in the transcript of testimony, taken at Bancroft, was very carefully checked and it was found that the actual cost to the company for rendering this switching service was $6,096 per annum per station. as shown by the following statement: operators at J45 each $ night operator and clerical work tent of office leat, light and water lattery power ring itationery, printing, and postage 90.00 per mon 50.00 " 10.00 " " 12.00 " 2.50 ' 10.00 " </seg>

The names and numbers of the farm line subscribers are printed in the telephone company's directory and while it is true the telephone subscribers have access to the 88 farm line subscribers it is also tine that the farm line subscribers have access to the 301 com- pany subscribers. As the present directory is over three years old, and of very little use, the telephone company has been given a reason - able allowance for printing, in our estimation, and should, without delay, publish an up-to-date directory. The telephone company and the farm lines that are switched are to be congratulated on the splendid eervice the telephone company is rendering as upon persistent inquiry from witnesses and patrons who were present at the hearing all spoke in the highest terms of the service. We therefore, find that this applicant should be authorized to harge and collect the amount for its switching service as applied for.

            <seg id="p357">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 357 The company's income statement for 1923 shows that after hav - ng paid fixed charges and the allocated portion of bond discount and hereafter having paid dividends on the outstanding preferred stock here was left for the common stock $5,607.85. This result is with- &gt;ut consideration of a retirement reserve accrual. During the year mentioned only current maintenance and replacements were cared Fur as operating expense. It will thus be seen that the common stock which it is proposed to issue did not earn anything in 1923. The show - ng for 1922 was no better. Applicant took the position that its showing was complete, that it had spent in excess of the net proceeds of the proposed issue in extensions and improvement of its facilities and that it was not necessary or proper for the Commission to inquire into antecedent financing and that whatever might have been the practices in years past the proposed financing was not only reasonably necessary for corporate purposes, but highly advisable. The Commission did not take that view of the matter and inquired rather deeply into the history of the financial transactions of applicant corporation. That history may be summarized as follows: Applicant company was organized as a Delaware corporation in 1914. In 1915 it purchased the electric properties of the Grand Island Electric company, located generally at Grand Island, Ne - braska. It retired capital obligations of the purchased company in approximate amount $334,000. issued in lieu thereof $250,000 of ten - year six per cent debenture notes, and $300,000 of capital stock. It m this property on its books as worth $540,243. While it cannot ertainly be said to be true, it would appear that a considerable por - ion of this issue of common stock was bonus representing nothing ncrete than assumed intangible values. Shortly thereafter the corporation began development of exten- sive hydraulic electric properties at Boelus, Nebraska, and the con - struction of certain transmission lines. The contracting firm was the chief stockholder of applicant corporation at that time. It under - took to complete the construction and received in payment therefor first mortgage six per cent bonds in amount of $600,000 and common capital stock in amount of $300,000. On another contract this same construction company was paid with first mortgage bonds in par amount $100,000. A note appended to the journal entry recording these transactions indicates that the bonds were accepted by the contractor at a price of approximately eighty-five per centum of par and that the stock was a bonus. Still later the same contracting firm was paid for other construction In bonds of par value of $150,000, these apparently having been accepted at par. In 1919 the company concluded the purchase of the Kearney </seg>
            <seg id="p358">358 SEVENTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT "ater &amp; Electric Power company and the Midway Gas company of vearney. The purchase price was somewhere near $750,000. The endors of the Kearney properties accepted obligations of the applicant n considerable part of the payment of the properties. The physical roperties acquired by this purchase were put on tbe books at $7 50, - 34.54. The same properties had been valued by the Commission pproximately three years earlier, exclusive of additions and better - ments added thereafter, at approximately $300,000. Refinancing was undertaken at the time of this purchase. The first mortgage bonds, which had been sold to the construction con - tractors in amount $850,000, were called in, as well as the six per cent debenture notes issued in the original purchase of the Grand Island properties. Certain notes payable, issued to secure funds for construction, were also called in in amount approximately $70,000. There was issued in this refinancing and purchase proposal $1. 000 of first mortgage bonds and $500. ohm of preferred seven per stock. If there were any discount on these securities it appea have been reflected entirely in the price paid for the physical pr ties, or the price at which the previous securities were called in kThe accounting plan did not provide for amortization unts on bonds and inasmuch as the financing and refinancing wi rgely carried out among those deeply interested in the propert \ tich reflections of market prices were evidentl hich may be reflected in the plant a&lt; counts of first mortgage bonds, Series A ;ti td such discounts have been properly reflected on ; being regularly amortized. Debenture notes in amount $2 *•» structton company which built most of the properties acquired by purchase, and these notes were retired frc through issues of preferred stock. The record indi transfer was par for par. About the year 1920 the Middle West Utilities company, a holding ompany, with headquarters in Chicago, came into control of the ffairs of applicant corporation. Since the date of this control con - truction financing has been temporarily arranged by borrowing on hort-time and demand notes from this holding company, which from ime to time accepted first mortgage bonds at discounts in payment f this indebtedness. The current borrowings from the holding com - any have been at seven per cent. In May, 1922, the holding com - any accepted $560,000 par value of common stock in payment of 420,000 of notes payable for monies advanced. This common stock herefore netted applicant seventy-five per centum of par. In the ast two years the bonds disposed of have been at prices around </seg>
            <seg id="p359">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 359 ighty-three cents on the dollar. These bonds bear six per cent merest. Money thus secured Is therefore costing the company over ight per cent. he company's plant account shows property worth $3,467,689.52 December 31, 1923, with construction in progress totaling additional thereto. It is plain from the previous state- he history of this account that it can be accepted as represent - the cost of the property in cash and securities. It cannot be as the cost in dollars. In 1920 the company made an ap - f its properties in support of an application to the bureau of securities for authority to sell preferred stock. The properties were surveyed and this appraisal closely analyzed In a special report made for the bureau of securities by experts hired by said bnreau. That report found that any issues of bonus stock and discounts on secur - ities sold at less than par. and such discounts not amortized, were more than overcome by a re-appraisal of the properties and the inclusion of overhead arbitraries and intangibles. We cannot say that the in - ventory was at prices in excess of fair values at this time, but the overheads are more liberal than this Commission has heretofore ap - proved. Hence, it cannot be said that the common stock outstanding on the date of this application, in amount $1,160,000, represents prop - erty of equal value. The nature of this case does not make It neces - sary for us to ascertain the exact status of this common stock as it ates to property. The exchange of common stock for preferred stock under all the ircumstances is advantageous to the company and is not detrimental to the public. Those who will receive this common stock know the properties well and fully understand the transaction. The liquida - tion of short-time and demand notes by the Issuance of common stock Is also advantageous to the corporation and Is under the circum - stances of no disadvantage to the public. These notes are owed to the holding company, which now owns practically all the outstanding common stock, and the officers of this holding company are thoroughly aware of the results of the transaction. There remains only to be considered the price which applicant will net for this common stock which it is proposed shall be eighty cents on the dollar. The preferred stock bears seven per cent divi - dends annually, which dividends have been paid. About one-half of this preferred stock Is in the hands of the general public. The notes bear six per cent interest. There was also paid a brokerage fee of one per cent per annum on these borrowings, which is a profit to the holding company which made the loans. The fixed charge of six per cent will therefore be eliminated. The common stock Is earning but little and after this financing will not, until the operating ratio has been reduced, earn at as high a rate as the obligations being re- </seg>

At South Bend it is proposed to construct a first-class approach from the county highway to the proposed depot loca - such approach to pass nearby the elevator and stock yards and of sufficient elevation to render it reasonably accessible In weather. dow the proposed location would be immediately adjacent to i highway leading from Louisville in the direction of Omaha nutield. At Meadow there is no town. At South Bend the busi- ness portion of the town is slightly less than one-half mile from the present location of the depot which in turn is not far from the county way running north and south into the town of South Bend. The effect of the removal of the depot at South Bend, as proposed. would be to put this structure 2100 feet farther away, for vehicular traffic, from the business portion of the town, than the present loca - tion. For pedestrians the distance to the proposed location would not greatly exceed the distance to the present location, if such pedes - trians used the Burlington right of way. The purpose of the proposed changes is to reduce expenditures. At each of the railroad crossings the company maintains 24-hour signal service in three shifts. The operators of the towers are tele - graphers as well. The company's proposition would therefore eliminate the expense of the present agent at the two points, which amounts </seg>

Incidental to the change would whatever advantage accrues to the town from 24-hour depot ser - e where at present the service is for eight hours. tNo protestants appeared with respect to the proposed change at iadow. For South Bend the owner of the elevator, a farmer living mediately adjacent to the present depot, and the chairman of the lage board appeared as respondents. The elevator owner alleged an average business of thirty-two ars a year during the past three years and objected chiefly to the nconvenience of having to go a distance of 2,000 feet in dealing with the agent. His elevator is open only a portion of the year. Our ecords show an average of sixteen cars shipped out per annum on his railroad during the past seven years. The farmer found it convenient to be immediately adj perfect economies in operation. Among the plan In this application. South Bend is served by the Burlington as w sland. The Burlington station is convenient and its trains for pas - enger traffic are operated at more convenient hours. Most of the &gt;assenger revenue originating at the town is earned by the Burling - on. The Burlington's freight revenue is high because of shipment of sand and gravel, not participated in by the Rock Island. Grain shipments were about equally divided during the past seven years. Live stock moves almost exclusively by the Rock Island. The relation of earnings at South Bend of the two railroads serving the town, and he volume of the traffic is shown by the copied tabulation below: the depot as he can deliver cream without the use of a vehicle. H e production of cream is one can in ten days. He also occasional uses the railroad for travel. The chairman of the village board, W. J. &lt;&gt; Brien. offered r objection to the proposal except that the village would like a roa opened from the town parallel to the Burlington right of way to tt new depot location. This would almost cut the distance in two. would require purchase by the railroad of a right of way and tt construction of a road. The right to condemn such roadway do&lt; not exist.

The record does not indicate that there could be any division of the expense of securing such road - way. It the Rock Island had to purchase the roadway and build the road the expense would do much to offset the economies desired. We are in favor of economies when they can be had without serious sur- render of service to the public. In the proposal at South Bend, those shipping live stock and grain and those receiving or shipping less than car load freight, are but little inconvenienced by the proposal. Those desiring to use the Rock Island for passenger service will be Inconvenienced. The tabulation shows that that traffic is very light.

In the computations above additions and betterments, shown in (B.i, include all overheads as allocated from experience and carried in the accounts and are not duplications of charges against operations. The overheads applied by the valuation engineers and shown in (C&gt; above are their own estimates and are not based upon the company's experience. It was not until recent years that, in the gradual evolution of the plant, over - heads were recognized on the books as capital ehMSM. In the main they were charged currently as expenses of operation. Some testimony wa» presented illustrating applicant's theories on which It arrived at figures to represent working capital, going value, and cost of financing. While the items used by the company to make up its working capital are tangible assets and are security for obligations outstanding, we think they are in part erroneously termed working capital. It will be noted that the figures of the exhibits summarized above present only reproduction cost new as evidence of the value of the plant and present nothing whatever as to depreciation. The liabilities statement shows that the company recognizes existing depreciation and has set up on the consolidated properties (1,558,000 to care tor retirements.

            <seg id="p367">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 367 handling depreciation, it does not fully meet what we consider to be the present law on tbe subject. In so tar as the main exhibit of the company is presented in this case it is bottomed upon the reasoning that issues of securities are proper against intangible values of going concern, assumed cost Of iiiiuncing. and against the full measure of physical assets written up to meet existing price levels. The exhibit seems to make clear the con - clusion that at the time of its re-organization in 1917 the company not only included intangibles in the basis on which it re-issued its securities, but also anticipated the price levels which later occurred. blem. however, presented in this application, only in- directly concerns what has been done in the past. This applicant de - sires to issue and sell for cash certain stock and to invest the full pro - reeds in its properties. Our discussion heretofore has been for the purpose of showing why we should not, with the record before us, accept the company's chief exhibit as proof of the value behind the stock and bond obligations. We do not usually, and we do not here, accept book accounts of plant as being an accurate reflex of existing v Under the statutes we are required to pass on whether a proposed issue of securities is reasonably necessary for corporate purposes, which are therein enumerated. Reasoning broadly this may be said to include a scrutiny also of the business judgment exercised in the Helling price of the securities. It may also be said that the legislature desired that the Commission scrutinize the securities issues in the interest of purchasers. We have so proceeded In the past. As to the first question we have the known facts that this in - dustry, and this particular applicant's business, has been growing with remarkable, rapidity, not only necessitating the investment of large amounts of capital, but resulting in lowered costs of production, re - flected generally in the level of charges to consumers. In 1917 this applicant had 28,000 customers, served by a plant with 18,000 k. w. capacity. The average consumption per annum per residence customer was about 275 k. w. h. At the end of 1923 the company had 50,000 customers served by a plant with 53,000 k. w. capacity. The average annual consumption per residence consumer was 400 k. w. h. At the present time the peak demand so closely approaches the capacity that in the judgment of the company's executives it is essential to increase that capacity more than one-third. These are reasonable corporate purposes . This seven per cent preferred stock is to be sold to net the com - pany $90 per share. That means that the financial house which finds a market for this stock will secure $10 per share with which to pay </seg>

The company h definite experience on the cost of selling. It undertook within th last year or two as agent to find a local market for some pr stock theretofore sold by it. This stock was owned by the Ele Bond &amp; Share company. The expense for selling 1!,6S7 shares billed to the owning financial house, was $11,090, but this did include the amount paid by the financial company itself for expens Incurred by it, nor did it include such discounts as were absorb by the company owning the stock. Some bond issues hav approved by us within the year where the cost of selling was MTU ten per cent. Hence, it cannot be said that this is not ;t. r»-as prudent contract on the part of applicant.

We of these computations consideration of the common stock ince it is junior to the proposed issue. It would thus appear, and hat from the point of view of the investor, we are able At approve the proposed issue. ill remains to be considered the question whether this mpany is required to comply with the provision of the Nebraska nstitution, Section 5, Article 10, which reads: "The capital stock of public utility corporations or common i arricrs shall not be increased for any purpose, except after public notice for sixty days, and in such manner as may be provided by law." In two instances of recent date we interpretated this provision is applying only to domestic corporations. Counsel for the Com - mission now says that this was an erroneous view; that the provision la self-executing; that the clause "in such manner as may be provided by law" relates to the increase and not to the notice, that it applies to foreign corporations under that provision of the constitution (Aricle 12, Section 1) which says: Foreign corporations transacting, or seeking to transact &lt;ss in this state, shall be subject, under general law, to regu- lation, supervision and general control, and shall not be given greater rights or privileges than are given domestic corporations of a similar character." His position is that the requirement of publication of notice for lxty days is a restriction and hence the provision quoted above is applicable. He also advises that failure to comply with this provision on the part of a foreign corporation would render it liable to ouster proceedings. Counsel for the company takes the position that the provision is not self-executing in that the clause "and in such manner as may be provided by law" modifies only the requirement for a notice. He also position that the entire article, including section 5. applies takf only to domestic corporations. </seg>
            <seg id="p370">370 SEVENTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT This question has not been passed upon by the court since the constitution was adopted. It is clear that the Commission's respon - sibility chiefly lies in supervising the matter contained in the clause of section 5, article 10, reading: "in such manner as may be pro - vided by law." If the contention of counsel for the Commission Is correct that the clause relates to the entire subject matter of issues of securities the requirement of public notice for sixty days, whatever may be its full scope, is an inhibition, active or potential, upon the corporation.

Nebraska, for Authority to Increase Rates. Appearan For applicant, R. L. Keester, general manager. For subscribers, J. G. Thompson, Alma. For Highline Mutual Telephone Company, Guy Newton, Stamford. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE. Chairman Informal objections were made to applicant company and In correspondence with the Commission by business interests of Orleans and Alma on account of the lack of telephone service for five hours during the middle of each Sunday and each holiday. Resulting from these demands this application was made for authority to increase rates five cents a month on all classes of subscribers including independent lines receiving switching service, to secure additional funds alleged to be necessary to pay the cost of the additional service. At the same time applicant asked to Increase rates for residence and business service at the exchanges of Orleans, Republican City and Stamford on account of the additional investment making those properties metallic service. Hearing was held at Alma April 9. The matter of additional ser - vice had been considered by commercial clubs and community clubs at alma, Orleans and Republican City. So far as counsel for subscribers at these places presented their attitude it was that this service should be rendered without additional charge on the ground that rates are already high enough to warrant full service every day in the year. The representatives of the exchange at Stamford stated that it was the position of all subscribers that present service limit is preferable to any increase In rates. Witnesses for Republican City stated that they preferred present service to any increase in rates, but that they considered present rates high enough to cover additional service. The witnesses called to represent commercial interests at Alma and Orleans were willing to have the rates raised sufficiently to pay the added expense if necessary, but they felt that the burden should be equally distributed among all subscribers. The evidence indicated quite clearly that farm line subscribers on no exchange were asking for the additional service although willing to accept it if it came free. For the company it was alleged that the additional service would cost $800 a year and that present net revenues would not Justify such </seg>

In support of the application for increase in rates of town service, at three of the four exchanges, it was pointed out that sharp increases in taxes are immin - ent, that an additional operator is quite essential at Orleans and that the additional investment warrants the increases asked for. The impression appeared to prevail that ratt's for ser\i&gt; har by this company are rather high. Such is not the fact munities served by applicant company enjoy relativel: rates.

Witness (or the company did not have much information concerning operating conditions at Orleans, neither as to hours of service of operators or as to unjust impositions in the way of overwork on the operators there. We will postpone consideration of probable increases in operating costs until the evidence presented is more convincing. The rates at Orleans, Republican City and Stamford were based on investment prior to the improvements installed in the last three or four years. At the present time technical discrimination exists against Alma which pays slightly higher rates than Orleans for approximately Identical service. This discrimination is not necessarily unlawful. If at any time the company does need additional revenue we will, in keeping with our findings dated January 16, 1920. authorize increases at Orleans to the present rates at Alma and such adjustments at the other exchanges as the revenue necessity may warrant. At the present time and on the record now before us. it does not appear that any adjustments of service or of rates should be made at this time. This is not In prejudice to a renewal of the application, if the anticipated increased expenses are actually realized or if agree - ment can be reached between subscribers and company for Sunday service on any one or more exchanges.

Appearances For applicant, C. A. Magaw, counsel. For Commission, B. E. Forbes, chief engineer OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Chairman Applicant is a corporation organized and existing under and by virtue of the laws of the state of Delaware. Its corporate purposes include chiefly the construction, purchase, and operation of public utility properties engaged in the manufacture of electric current for light, heat and power, and of plants engaged in the manufacture, distribution, and sale of artificial gas for heating and lighting pur - poses. Applicant owns and operates within the state of Nebraska electric and gas plants at North Platte and an electric plant at Columbus. By virtue of the provisions of section 676 of the Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, as amended by Chapter 168 of the Session Laws of 1923, applicant has filed its petition here for our approval of the proposed issue of certain securities, with the proceeds of which to purchase properties in South Dakota. The securities which it is proposed to issue are liens, or obligations, also on the Nebraska properties of the corporation. The bonds which It is proposed to issue to secure a portion of the funds for the proposed purchase are secured by a first mortgage on all of the properties, including those located in this state. Options have been secured by applicant on the purchase of electric and gas plants at Mitchell, Soufh Dakota, and electric and gas plants at Huron, South Dakota. The option on the Mitchell properties Includes a purchase price of $875,000, all of which, according to the testimony, is to be paid in cash. The option on the Huron properties is at a price of $825,000, to be paid by the assumption of an indebted - ness of $464,000, secured by a first mortgage, the acceptance by vendors of $200,000 in seven per cent debenture notes, and the pay - ment of the remainder in cash. On account of the Mitchell purchase it Is proposed to Issue (a) first mortgage, twenty-five-year, 6 V* per cent gold bonds in amount </seg>

The appraisal was made on the and materials costs of January 1. 1924. To these "b; construction figures were added what we consider lit construction arbitrages and other arbitraries rafTCM cost of financing and intangible values. The appn rl. le Eitified that he considered the figure a fair 01 aperties. but admitted that in arriving at a se other factors were necessary to consider. t Counsel for applicant urged that the law under w ission operates does not presume to protect the inve w is different in its purpose Uiau the general securi tlarly in this respect, and that if the properties are worth the pri id the prospect of satisfactory earnings on such price is forei) to the issues of this case.

The payment of a premium in the purchase of properties may be well justified. It represents the forecast of the future, ant case the present earnings support the price. It would appear, however, that any speculative proportion in the acquisition of properties, where such expansion is not made for the purpose of meeting the public service obligations, should be represented In such securities as do not ordinarily get into the hands of small in - vestors.

In the original case presented to this Commission by this appli - ant (Application No. 5327 16 N. S. R. C. 373-375) we authorized an issue of thirty thousand shares of no-par common stock. That ssue represents certain expense of acquisition and temporary advances o cover such discounts on securities as were necessary in meeting purchase prices. Under the proposed plan these stocks will also have he support of the additional investment in property not capitalized. The market price is largely controlled by earnings, past, present and prospective. In the present proceedings counsel for the Commission has presented certain questions of law not heretofore advanced for con - ideration. His position is that we cannot approve these applications because, first, the constitution of the state of Nebraska forbids the ssuance of stock without par by domestic corporations, and. second, he state cannot give greater privileges to foreign corporations than hose exercised by domestic corporations and this prohibition includes he Commission's activities within its scope. Counsel admits that the ssuance of stock without par by applicant company is perfectly legal n the state where it is organized and admits that the existence of his no-par stock does not prevent the corporation from engaging in msiness in the state, but he urges that where, in the course of euch justness, it becomes necessary to secure affirmative sanction from this state to provisions of the articles which are illegal for a domestic corporation such sanction cannot be given. If the position of counsel is correct the company must amend its articles of incorporation to provide for common stock of named par and must retire such no-par stock and secure authorization for its re - placement with a proper amount of par stock before we can act on his application, which does not include an issue of common stock n any form. We recognize strong arguments in favor of the position aken by counsel, but after careful consideration are constrained at his time not to attack the no-par stock issued. Practical considera - ions are before us. The courts have not passed on the questions raised. This applicant has purchased properties and must finance the purchases. The money to be secured from the securities here under discussion is to be spent tor acquisition of property. The disputed stock is not on the market. It will continue to be closely held until such time as a case may arise where interpretation of the law may be secured. Machinery appears adequate to require the change in form of common stock later if the law is found so to direct. Litigation on this issue now will interfere with imperative financing. If counsel or the Commission is correct part of the present irregular condi- </seg>

We are disposed to remedy that error, if it is found to have been one, at a moment less vital in the affairs of applicant.

No dividends have been paid since organization in 1905 and salaries paid have been conservative. I its early construction considerable labor was donated in the uiilding of the plant. In 1918 the Commission's engineering depart- lent made a physical valuation of applicant's property and found an riginal cost of $11,555.40 and a depreciated value of $5,921.19, thus idicating that the plant was in a very depreciated condition and that extensive rebuilding program would be necessary In the near future. Since 1918 considerable of the plant has been rebuilt and plans are now made for completing the entire rebuilding scheme. The company has not experienced any material growth since 1918 but information at hand does indicate without doubt that the present ndition of its plant is greatly improved. The opinion is expressed the officers of the company that its territory at this time Is well vploped and very few additional subscribers will be served. The increase in revenues applied for will provide $198 additional nils per annum. It is anticipated, that with this increase and a ecently adopted plan for the operation of its plant, the company will &gt;e able to operate efficiently and pay a reasonable return to the Heretofore a lineman has been employed who was compensated at the rate of $125 per month. This wage included both lineman's labor and the use of his automobile. At present a lineman is employed for thirty cents per hour. He also furnishes an automobile, the com- pensation for which the directors have not yet decided upon. It is the opinion of the officers of the company, however, that a saving of per annum will be realized under the new arrangement. A study of the past five years experience of the company disclose* that maintenance expenditures have averaged $1,868.44 per annum. This expenditure undoubtedly represents an abnormal period because of applicant's extensive rebuilding program. The reduction of the lineman's wage is another reason for not using the figure as a measure of future requirements. After giving consideration to the Increase in revenues applied for, and the reduction in future expenses, the following estimated operating statement is found for the purpose of this order. </seg>

The business men protesting expressed that the increase applied for was not sufficient and sugge rates be increased proportionately. in t-tl ttl ita The Commission has always approved a differential of rates as between business and farm subscribers. It cannot be denied that the business houses realize more direct benefits from the use of tht telephone than other patrons. Further, on the basis of use. it is generally true that many more service connections are made through the switchboard in a j:iven time for business subscribers than for other classes of service. In other words, central office expense, nieasur on the basis of the number of calls through the switchboard clearly demonstrates that business telephones cost more to operate than residence or farm stations. Since a large portion of applicant's property has been rebuilt since the Commission's valuation in 1919 it is reasonable to assume that its present depreciated value Is greatly increased. For the purposes of this case the present value of the property is placed at $S,000 on which the applicant is entitled to earn a return. </seg>

It also shows that accounts payable include bond interest, interest on open accounts and other small charges of less importance. Therefore, the value of the company's ledger figures as a measure of the cost of the existing property is of little assistance to the Commission in arriving at its conclusion and it becomes necessary to turn to the Inventory and appraisement of the properties for a more definite measure of the plant and service.

W. generator turbine, two 408 horsepower boilers and the smoke stack at the generating plant. The transmission lines have all been erected since 1919. The large water main from Nebraska City to the packing plant is also ruw. The Gas company has experienced the complete re - placement of one generator and a large storage tank has been added. NVw service connections in both properties have been installed, but a large part of the electric distribution system was constructed before the period of high prices and this is true of the principal water and pas mains, also buildings and gas reservoirs. Applicant has applied the actual costs of the new property in so lar as they were available from the records of the company and the remainder was estimated on a price level approximately t%% above the pre-war plans. On the results so found applicant has computed overhead expenses on a liberal basis. These include interest during construction for one year at 8%, engineering and superintendence at 5"%. contingencies in the amount of 2% of 75^ t of the total, also a cost of establishing business at 5%. To this sum working capital has been added in the amount of $49,065, or almost 5% of the total estimated cost of fixed property. By this method applicant finds the estimated cost of overhead expenses to be $179,784 as necessary to the construction of property in the amount of $854,951. This is approximately 20%, which is higher than the Commission has found to be necessary from the experience of other companies. This is not a rate case where the Commission recognizes apprecia - tion in property, resulting from a change in price levels, in finding a base, as rates are subject to changes as operating expenses and price levels fluctuate.

When this is done the quick liabilities of the Water and Light company will be consolidated in the fixed capital which will Improve the financial situation after the purchase. LAn analysis of the accounts payable to the Nebraska City Utilities pany is as follows: Cash $375, 200. 00 Bond Interest Other Interest.... General Expense 6.000.00 99.572.77 5.204.54 Materials &amp; Engineering Audits and Bookkeeping Grand Island Turbine 4,110.78 2.389.14 10,000.00 Total $572,477.23 Less Adjustments 12,237.84 Net Credits $560,239.39 It appears that cash was advanced in the amount of $374,200.00. t other large items are bond interest and interest on open accounts. company showed that net earnings after direct operating expenses sufficient to pay interest charges, but these were used for new construction and replacements From this viewpoint "'Bond Interest" and "Other Interest" will be considered as casl advanced. In the same way the Grand Island turbine in tl mi of $10,000 is equivalent to cash. The small items which are proper charges to operating expenses would also be included as cash advanced on the assumption that the property earned operating expenses but these amounts were not paid and went in with the property. The credit balance in the account as of December 31, 1918, is $62,997.54. The testimony is that this is made up of bond interest aud interest on open accounts which was not paid for the reasons stated above. The problem presented by this application includes proper considera - tion of early excessive issues of securities, deficits from operation extended over long periods of time, and the disposition of heavy demand liabilities incurred in betterment and extension program. Even though the books of this company's predecessors and all the earlier history of applicant are missing, it is reasonably clear that the plant was originally constructed from the proceeds of the issue of bonds totaling $200,000 and that the stock in amount of $300,000 was a bonus issue. There is some evidence that the preferred stock amounting to $50,000 was issued to cancel interest due and either not earned or earned in whole or in part and invested in plant. </seg>
            <seg id="p391">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 391 This bonus issue of stock so many years ago was never overcome through earned surplus in later years. In fact the company did not, through its earnings, hold its own and provide by invested surplus the margin later necessary to overcome property retirements. The adverse balance of liabilities originally created was accentuated through the years. This is clear enough from the evidence. The company presented an inventory and appraisal, as has been already shown, indicating a plant, the gross value of which under today's prices was $1,040, - 384.44. This is exclusive of the going value item included by the company. The figure includes book increases of plant value due to the reappraisal estimated by the Commission's engineer at $227,600. The liabilities, exclusive of the stock which we have designated as bonus stock, exceeds even this reappraisal figure. The loss due to operation must therefore equal the increase in plant due to re - appraisal plus the excess of liabilities when the reappraisal figure Is i&lt;sed in assets. The investment of $711,749.73 by the Gas company and Electric company from funds borrowed from the Nebraska City Utilities com - pany has been found by our accountants to be bona fide. This debt is senior to any issue of stock and cannot be avoided by applicant. Securities representing nothing but hopes should not be issued r approved. The securities here asked for represent dollars borrowed. The most conservative method would call for the cancellation of the bonus stock issued in the early days of the company. We cannot re - quire that this be done. The applicant cannot call in the stock and cancel it, except with consent of the owners of the stock. If we approve the liquidation of the demand notes, owned by applicant, through the sale of stock only to the extent that property may definitely exist in protection we have not thereby reduced the total of the com - pany's obligations. The remainder of the demand notes will continue to exist and will be senior to the stock and the stock will not be pro - tected by property. Such an order from this Commission would be detrimental both to the public service and to the possible purchaser of the securities. It was suggested that the company might ask for an issue of preferred stock to represent the actual Investment as distinguished from the early bonus stock. Such a solution of the problem is subject to the weakness that there Is In this particular case not property enough to equal such an issue of preferred stock plus the bonded debt because of loss in displaced and worn out property in the last quarter of a century not compensated for through earnings. </seg>

Notices of the proposed change of rates were sent by the com - pany to all subscribers and by the Commission to the local newspaper. No protests were filed. It was said of record that a committee repre - senting the community club investigated the company's needs and approved the application. In our opinion the proposed rat^s will yield no more revenue than is essential to correct and adequate service to the public under careful management and reasonable wages for the capital invested. We so find. The rates will be approved on statutory notice.

In 1923 the company authorized the Issue of the </seg>
            <seg id="p399">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 399 fifteen year bonds in the amount of $160,000.00 to bear seven per cent interest in payment of its notes and accounts payable. This was done without consideration of section VI, article 12, of the constitu - tion of this state and the statute which provides that the issue of securities by public utility corporations for property in this state shall have the approval of this Commission. The company applied for a validation of the above bond issue and a hearing was held in the offices of the Commission April 22, 1924. The testimony shows that Mr. C. H. Cornell of Valentine con - ceived the idea of hydro-electric development on the Niobrara river near Valentine. In 1906 he was granted the right to use the water of the Niobrara river for power purposes by a special act of congress. This was necessary as the dam site is located on land reserved by the government. This right was extended from time to time by the proper authorities and construction was started in the year 1915. The property consists of a timber dam about two hundred feet in length and twelve feet in height in the Niobrara river with the necessary water wheels, generators and other equipment to produce approxi - mately 250 kilowatts per hour. A transmission line connects the generating plant with the company's distribution system in Valentine. Applicant supplies the city with electric power to pump its water and electric current for street lighting, in addition to the local demand for service. In the years 1922 and 1923 the villages of Cody, Kilgore and Crookston constructed transmission lines which connect with the company's generating plant where they buy electric current. Mr. Cornell provided the funds to pay for the construction of the plant as it proceeded. He took the company's notes tor part of the money advanced and the remainder was represented by open accounts payable to him. These notes and accounts do not include any interest during construction, profits or intangibles which might properly be classified as general expenditures, with the exception of money paid for engineering and supervision at the time of construction. In the year 1917 the Commission instructed its engineer to in - spect the property and check the accounts of the company for the purpose of finding the sums actually expended for construction. The l olio wing statement is quoted from his report: "My examination of the books showed that they were kept in the following manner: When the construction on the dam began all expenses were charged to construction. The various items of labor, material and equipment with the amount paid show clearly in the construction account. All these charges were paid by check, and to the best of my knowledge, the checks issued will balance with the construction account." The following asset and liabilities statement of the company as of September 22, 1917, is also taken from his report: </seg>

It is also prob- able that Mr. Cornell failed to recall many small amounts which should have been included with the additions and betterments be- tween 1917 and 1922. The balance sheet of the company as of December 31, 1923, giving ffect to the new bond issue Is as follows: fixed Capital $147,063.52 Contracts, Good Will and Franchise... 200,000.00 Customers Ledger • 6,782.59 Notes Receivable 259.69 Deficit 21,041. 42 Material and Supplies 1,194.95 Cash on Hand 95.69 Capital Stock $200,000.00 Bonds 160,000.00 Bond Premium 3,450.52 Notes Payable 2.952.85 Accounts Payable 9,613.39 Taxes Accrued 945.00 Ready to Serve 197.96 Insurance Accrued 142.55 Bank Overdraft 135.59 $377,437.86 $377,437.86 </seg>
            <seg id="p402">402 In this statement the plant account la $147,063.52. This results from the fact that an inventory was taken prior to 19 22 and property was found which had not been properly charged. This adjustment ■was apparently made on the cost basis. The results of an inventory and appraisal by an engineer as of Jay 1, 1923. show the cost of reproduction new to be Iltl.99t.t7, and the same less depreciation in the sum of $153,992.15, when addi - lons and betterments for the year 1923 in the sum of $9,928.33 is added to the depreciated cost, the result is $163,920.48. The price units used in this appraisal are not shown. Having in mind the fact that Mr. Cornell has advanced the funds o construct this plant and provide additions and betterments through a period of years and has received no interest on sums advanced, nor dividends on the stock held by him and no compensation from the ompany for all the services rendered from the beginning, the Com - mission believes and so finds that the bonds in the sum of $160,000.00 par value are represented by money paid, labor done or property mated that the revenue from this source will be increased approxi - mately $2,800.00 during 1924 and that operating will be reduced by he use of water p-ower during the winter months. From this it appears that the earnings will be sufficient to insure payment of the nterest on the bonds and the issue will be validated.

OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: This application is presented by the Chicago, Burlington tt Quincy Railroad company requesting authority to operate over its lines of railway within Nebraska a special livestock demonstration train. The plan contemplates cooperative action between applicant. College of Agriculture of the University of Nebraska, Nebraska Dairy Development Society and various dairy cattle breed association*. It is proposed to distribute in the territory traversed a number of pure bred dairy sires, the same to be exchanged even, with farmers or stock men for "scrub" sires. The "scrubs" will be sold at the Omaha yards at the conclusion of the trip and funds received therefrom will be distributed among the livestock breeders who furnish the young pure bred sires. The special train will also carry dairy cows, and other stock, for true type demonstrations, which will not be disposed of. they being the property of the College of Agriculture. For each stop a program will be arranged. The exchange of the thoroughbred for the "scrub" will be made one in each community, and lectures and demonstrations will be given by competent parties. Other inter - esting program features will also be worked out. The whole purpose of the plan is to encourage the breeding of pure bred stock and to stimulate interest in dairying in Nebraska. It is the desire of applicant to transport these animals from station to station free of charge. The work is a service for the state. </seg>

All supplemental telephone service to be as per original application. Night calls, after hours $ .10 each Line calls for advertising purposes 05 per line Hearing on this case was held at Superior, July 9. So far as could be ascertained at that time the outstanding stock in amount $10,000 was sold for cash at par. The company was developed about twenty years ago in the manner many small independent companies developed, that is — local people desiring not to lose trade territory because of invading lines of other companies round about, interested themselves in the problem of a local telephone plant. The rates of the company have been $1 per month net for all classes of service since its origin. The cost of operating the plant has increased during the period of higher general prices, this being particularly true of main - .enaiice. This increasing cost of doing business was not properly viewed by the stockholders, at least until of recent date. The present manager and secretary, a local man, bought a con - trolling interest of stock about a year ago. Apparently he paid a small premium for the stock, although the transactions involved trades which render that conclusion doubtful. This stock purchase was a private transaction. No change was had legally in the com - pany. Change of control merely meant change of management. After the private negotiations for sale of stock were completed, the board of directors which was under the control of the men who were selling their stock, voted a special dividend comprising all outstanding bills receivable from subscribers. This transaction was well understood by the purchaser, who apparently obligated himself to collect these accrued accounts to the extent they were collectible and to turn the money over to the stockholders of record at the time the special dividend was declared. This special dividend apparently amounted to close to $2,000. Dividends of at least 8 per cent have been paid steadily, excluding the special dividend referred to. All this was done on rates relatively low. It could not have occurred except for unusual labor conditions locally and the donation of much time by the officers of tKe company. No accounts which can be relied upon were kept until recent years and only the accounts of the past three years reflect generally what happened. During those three years the average revenues collected were $4,545, the expenses recorded as such, $2,862, although in the period of three years over $2,000 was spent for maintaining the property above what was shown as an expense. This was caused by </seg>
            <seg id="p408">408 SEVENTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT a misunderstanding of instructions from the Commission's accounting department. Its effect was to greatly over-state the actual net earn - ngs. The company's property account was approximately what it was when the company started, although an inventory by the Com - mission's engineer showed that the plant or property account should • ave been almost twice as high in the gross, as it was carried on the books. Whereas the company was setting aside on the average only $1,060 with which to maintain the property and pay for lineman - services, it should have been setting aside about $2,000 per annum If it had done so its reserve account would have shown substantial accruals for future exigencies where it does show an overdraft of almost $r,no. If the nimiiany had been setting aside the proper amo maintenance, the expenses per station for the past three years w have averaged $11.71 per year excluding taxes and dividends. Th Commission's inventory shows distinctly that at least in recet the property has been deteriorating. A continuati situation would result in bankruptcy.

Applicant expressed a willingness to interchange service. The Nuckolls Eiunty Telephone company, whose property would be used in such terchange, refused to consider it. At the present time, toll messages between farmers on the Hardy exchange and farmers on the Ruskin exchange pass from Hardy to Superior to Nelson to Ruskin.

Respondent subscribers took an unusually fair position in regard to this application. They admitted the company needed more revenues and that they had been receiving service at much lower cost than neighbors of other exchanges. They questioned only the extent of increase asked. The rates we will approve in the order below are less than what is asked by the company, not because the application was unreasonable as measured by what has' been approved for like companies, but because this applicant finds himself able to operate with unusual economy. The rates we will approve should, if expenses do not unduly increase, leave available approximately ten per cent per annum as dividends on the investment, out of which applicant must of course pay his interest charges. This result includes reward &gt;r economy of operation. Such an emergency exists as warrants irly effect to this order.

OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Chairman The territory embraced by applicant electric district lies to the east of the village of Arlington. This application is made because of he provisions of section 7153 Revised Statutes of Nebraska for 1922 «s amended by chapter 169 of the session laws of 1923, which section provides that authority for the sale of the securities and to establish a. scale of rates shall be secured on application to this Commission.

The bonds shall not carry Interest in excess of six </seg>

As part of the evidence in the case, applicant has filed a trans - script of proceedings under which the district was formed and the proceedings of the board since the formation of the district. While it ilnfs not appear that the law contemplates that this Commission «hall scrutinize whether the district has been properly organized or the proper steps have been taken in preparation for the issuance of the bonds, the data at hand would indicate that the proceedings are regular. It is. however, the province of the state auditor to pass on this question. Section 67G-678 of the compiled statutes for 1922, referred to In The statute which authorizes districts of this character, provide that public service corporations shall Issue securities only after approval has been given by the State Railway Commission which shall, pre - cedent to that approval, find inter alia, that the capital secured by the issuance and sale of the securities Is reasonably required for the purposes of the corporation. The district has employed an engineering firm to draw plans and supervise construction. Copy of the plans Is filed with pleadings. Application also has been filed by the district under the provisions of article 3 chapter 67 R. S. 1922, for authority to construct the trans - mission lines and order of approval has been Issued. The record shows that the district engineer estimated the cost of the construction at $44,000 which includes the construction to every residence property in the district, the cost of transformers and meters and all other costs except inside wiring. Sealed bids were asked. The board has indicated its approval of a bid in amount $39,646. This is exclusive of all preliminary expenses, cost of the election, engineering and supervision nor does It include the necessary work - ing capital. It is proposed to issue and sell $44,000 of the bonds carrying interest at 5 H per cent, the bonds to be in denomination of $1,000 to be due and payable as follows: $2,000 on July 1, 1930, $3,000 annually thereafter, until the bonds are all retired. On this basis the district has been offered slightly more than par. Notice of the proposed election for the formation of the district carried with it a provision that the construction should be paid for by the issuance of bonds. The proposed issue is reasonably necessary for the purposes set forth in the application. The maximum issue is however, not to exceed </seg>

We are not sure that the law contemplates our taking this into account as the duties of the Commission appear to extend in other directions. We will however, in the interests of caution condition our approval of the Issue of bonds upon the filing by the board of directors with the Commission, of a copy of the certification of the rounty clerk as to the value of the property within the district and the further condition that such certification shall show that a bond issue of $44,000 does not exceed six per cent of the last assessed valuation of the property in the district.

It does not appear necessary to make such provision in this instance.

We will deal with that remaining indebtedness after a careful check to ascertain whether it has been incurred reasonably in a construction program. Applicant desires to sell preferred stock in limited amount, in •o far as practicable to customers, and to apply the proceeds to the reduction of current indebtedness. The Commission will approve the sale of all or any part of such preferred stock at par, but will require that none of the proceeds be used in retiring notes payable owed to system corporations, unless and until such approval is given in supplemental order following more detailed investigation.

The company presented statements showing a general decline in passengers tarried during the month of May from stations affected by the proposed removal. Specific figures for certain of the stations were presented in somewhat more detail. A check of passengers on and off as kept by conductors for a seven-day period in June was sub - mitted in evidence indicating the load between any two stations on any of the days checked. Oral testimony was given by various agents </seg>
            <seg id="p426">426 as to the amount of business done on tbe two trains. Much reliance was placed on a statement covering June 2 to June 7, 1924, showing the earnings from the trains to have been 84.7 cents per mile from all sources. As to expenses the company confined its testimony to a statement by Assistant General Manager Vilas that the average out-of-pocket cost of operating passenger trains on the North Western system was $1.10 per mile. The elimination of trains Nos. 2 and 1 1 would leave for use west of Norfolk trains Nos. 3 and 13 west-bound and Nos. 6 and 22 east - bound. No. 3 leaves Norfolk at 9 p. m. and arrives at Long Pine at 1:10 a. m. No. 13 leaves Norfolk at 4:40 a. m. and arrives at Long Pine at 9:10 a. m. No. 6 leaves Long Pine at 12:05 a. m. and arrives at South Norfolk at 5 a. m. No. 22 leaves Long Pine at 8:05 a. m. and arrives at South Norfolk at 12:25 p. m. It was urged that the west-bound trains furnish excellent service for mail and perishable express and that east-bound train No. 6 is an ideal train on which to handle the heavy cream shipments. It was declared by competent operating officials that the amount of business west of Norfolk did not justify more than two passenger trains each way each day. Objections were presented in testimony from most of the towns between Norfolk and Long Pine. In summary it was stated that the two trains are highly important as daylight trains available for women and children and that their removal would be a serious hardship on this class of traffic; that all cream and milk for Omaha at present is handled on train No. 2 which it is desired to discontinue necessitat - ing that cream shipments be held for more than twelve additional hours with consequent deterioration; that train No. 11 is of particular value in the handling of perishable express; that mail received from No. 11 can be answered that day; and that this train carries the Norfolk daily paper to a large number of subscribers interested in securing early market reports from a publishing point advantageously situated in the territory affected. Daylight trains are most convenient for use by women and chil - dren particularly. The elimination of any train works to the in - convenience of any person who rides those trains when operated. Daylight service would remain on train No. 22 and somewhat more inconvenient service would be available on No. 3 in the eastern por - tion of the territory affected and on No. 13 from O'Neill west. The average number of revenue passengers who used No. 11 during the test period was 67.3, these boarding the train at sixteen different towns. The average revenue passengers using No. 2 per trip were 41.3. </seg>
            <seg id="p427">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 427 The evidence showed that the reason cream is forwarded on train No. 2 (or Omaha is that an operating rule required it to be sent on that train. Train No. 6 now handles all cream for Sioux City, of which there is a large quantity. The deterioration on cream destined Omaha would be no less than on that destined to Sioux City. The company's estimate of express earnings as distinguished from milk and cream earnings, was 6.3 cents per mile. If the estimate is correct it goes far to refute the testimony that these are important express trains. The use of No. 11 by the afternoon paper published at Norfolk is very important. If the train is eliminated, this evening newspaper &lt; annot get into the territory sooner than editions from more distant points. Market reports carried in this afternoon paper are of great value to subscribers. This is an element to consider in determining applications for elimination of train service. Trains however, can - not be run for such purposes chiefly. Respondent, Norfolk News, has 1543 subscribers in the affected territory of whom 659 are not more than twenty-five miles distant from Norfolk. The elimination of these trains would leave the towns affected in the same or better position relatively as to other mail, than a very considerable majority of all towns in the state. The general rule applicable in the matter of operation of trains is that not every train operated nor every portion of a railway system need be profitable in order to enforce the continuation of service. When the business as a whole is unprofitable, reductions in service In the interest of economy or increases in rates must be permitted. The North Western has not been particularly profitable since the close of the world war. The year 1923 was the system's best year since 1919. It earned net available for interest and dividends $20,178,037 of which amount its interest obligations were $11,440,569. In April of this year the earnings available for interest and dividends were $240,505 as compared with $698,048 last year. It was an unusually poor month. The testimony was that May was also a very depressed month. Four months of 1924 showed net earnings of $3,753,668 as compared with $2,688,381 for the same period last year. It is too early to estimate whether the year 1924 will show better than the year 1923. These facts support the company's urgent contention that econ - omies in operation are highly necessary. This Commission has recognized such facts and has promptly approved very considerable reductions in passenger train service and alterations of schedules intended to produce better results. We have discouraged complaints on reduced way freight train service to conform with temporary re - duced tonnage. The reductions are justified. The effect of the changes already made is of course not yet evident. </seg>

The company could have presented the per mile cost in wages of train crew on the two le portion of station expenses properly assignable to the two he per mile average cost of locomotive and car repairs for ' this size, and the fuel cost per mile. In its finding on Application No. 5228, supra, relating to reduced n service on the Horton-Nelson branch of the Chicago, Rock Island tcific Railway company, the Commission found the out-of-pocket excepting general office expenses, to have been 55.5 cents per A. t In hearing on Application No. 4798 (17 N. S. R. C.) Missouri Pacific Railroad Corporation in Nebraska asked wher authority to reduce passenger train service on its so called Talmage brain h. evidence was presented of an out-of-pocket cost of 66.2 cents aut rain mile. In its finding on Applications 4700 and 4691 (15 N. C. 365-373) wherein the Union Pacific desired to make certain reductions in service on branch lines in Nebraska, the evidence as to out-of-pocket cost of steam trains was 72 cents per train mile in 1921. With the exception of the Union Pacific train, Omaha to Albion, the trains, other than those of applicant, mentioned above, are some - what lighter. These comparisons are mentioned for the purpose of mphasizing our objections to the nature of the cost data. The distance involved in the application here is 133 miles; in the In ion Pacific train case mentioned above the distance was 125 miles; in the Missouri Pacific case 103 miles and in the Rock Island case 1 n-h line passenger train service is always less in the summer n during the winter. This is a result of wide use of privately wned automobiles. The comparisons mentioned above show studies hat were made during corresponding periods with the exception of le Union Pacific case where the study covered a wider period. The specific test period on which applicant here chiefly relies comprises six days of a period of undoubted depressed traffic so far as short haul ptMHIU service is concerned, although it may present somewhat better express and baggage earnings. A similar test period in each season of the year would probably show on the average more favor ably. That is the general result at least. On the record before us, we are unable to say that applicant has justified the removal for an indefinite period of trains Nos. 2 and 11 for six days in the week, between South Norfolk and Long Pine. The burden of proof was upon it and has not been sustained. </seg>

SECOND SUPPLEMENTAL OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Chairman On July 19th this Commission authorized applicant company to make certain changes in passenger train service consisting of minor amendments to schedules plus one major change. In accordance with he practice of the Commission only the major change required formal appoval. UThe changes were made August 3, 1924. This order Is entered c pro tone. Applicant desired to schedule train No. 11 westbound as an exclusive passenger train as far as O'Neill and there to connect it as a mixed train with way freight No. 63 and to carry the equipment of No. 11 in that manner through to Long Pine. In reverse direction, it was desired to operate the equipment in mixed train service with way freight No. 64 from Long Pine to O'Neill and as an exclusive pas - senger train east of O'Neill. At the time of the application No. 11 was scheduled to leave O'Neill at 3:35 and to arrive at Long Pine at 5:30. No. 2 was </seg>
            <seg id="p431">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 431 scheduled to leave Long Pine at noon and to arrive at O'Neill at 2 p. m. Wholly separate from the consideration of the service west of O'Neill, it was found necessary to slow up No. 11 so that had it con - tinued as an exclusive passenger train, it would operate between O'Neill and Long Pine approximately one hour later than heretofore. Hence the change to mixed train service west of O'Neill lengthens the journey between O'Neill and Long Pine about one hour and one-half. This is not pleasant service to patrons of the road. However, other passenger trains are available in the morning and during the latter part of the first half of the night. This service need be used only by those who find the other trains inconvenient. Eastbound passengers desiring to take No. 2 from Long Pine must leave at 9:30 a. m. in place of at noon and spend approximately two hours and one-half more on the sixty mile journey than has been the case where purely passenger train service has been operated. How - ever, the eastbound service Is readily rendered by train No. 22 leaving Long Pine at 8:05 a. m., furnishing excellent service at convenient hours In our findings on application No. 5551, we denied to this applicant the right to remove the two trains entirely west of Norfolk. This alternative proposal will produce certain economics without large inconvenience to the road's patrons in the territory involved. With constantly dwindling local patronage, we must, where it can be done, give our unhesitating approval to measures of economy in operation. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Chicago and North Western Railway company be, and is hereby, authorized on not less than one day's publication in filing with this Commission, to operate passenger trains Nos. 2 and 11 In mixed train service between O'Neill and Long Pine in accordance with the proposal outlined in the findings above, provided that the passenger train equipment in such mixed trains shall be sufficient to care for the passenger traffic and the mail and express which would be handled were the trains to continue as passenger trains to Long Pine.

            <seg id="p434">434 APPLICATION NO. 8878 rthe Matter of the Application of the United Electric Company of Lexington, Nebraska, for authority to issue and sell securities. BROWNE, Chairman: Applicant is a Nebraska corporation engaged in the generation of electric current for sale for light, power, heating and other purposes in the state of Nebraska. It asks our authority to fund certain obliga - tions by the issuance and sale of $75,000 par value of first mortgage bonds, due and payable in 1935 and bearing interest at seven per cent. It asks also our authority to issue and to sell from time to time $25,000 in common stock for the purpose of securing funds with which to make additions and betterments to its properties. The history, the extent of property, and the financial status of thin company, as of date 1920, is well set forth in orders entered on applica - tion No. 4140, said orders dated December 13, 1919 (12 N. S. R. C. 372-375) and May 22, 1920 (13 N. S. R. C. 337-342). In the first of these orders, the company was authorized to ssue and sell at par $60,000 par value of seven per cent preferred stock, with the proceeds of which to retire notes and accounts pay - able, incurred in the construction of its properties. In the second of hese orders, the Commission cancelled the authorization of preferred stock and in lieu thereof authorized the issuance and sale of $60,000 of first mortgage six per cent bonds, due and payable in 1930. It authorized also additional bonds up to $40,000 par value to be sold o secure funds for improvements which were at that time contem - plated and fully outlined, and validated an issue of $50,000 of com - mon stock made in 1917. Of the $100,000 of six per cent bonds authorized, the company was able to sell $22,000 worth, all of which were taken by those nterested in the company. None of the proceeds were used tor addi - ions and betterments, but were applied in the reduction of current ndebtedness. UAs of date May 31, 1924. the as follows: indebtedness current and bonded First mortgage bonds Notes payable $22,000.00 24,282.78 26.905.09 Accounts payable tin part the notes payable represent indebtedness which has isted for several years. It was incurred in the purchase of the operties in 1917. In part, it represents cash borrowed for improve- </seg>

Most of this last named investment cost has been paid from time to time from net earnings. The accounts payable have come into existence through the policy ot the company of several years standing of declaring all profits made each year as dividends and of creditng these dividends to the accounts of the stockholders. Only such part of these dividends was paid as the company was able to pay after its investment necessities were met. In like manner, the regular salaries of officers were not always drawn but were credited to the accounts of the officers and the undrawn por - tion was used for corporate purposes. We are interested in ascertaining whether this Indebtedness was incurred for purposes which will permit of funding. In 1919, the company owed in excess of $60,000 on open account or on short time notes and had outstanding $100,000 in stock. After investigation the Commission approved the stock and authorized the issuance of securities to secure funds with which to retire the current indebted - ness. It is now asked that these obligations to the extent of $75,000 be funded. In its order on Application No. 4140, dated May 22, 1920, supra, the Commission said that the evidence at hand indicated a conserva - tive cost of property as of September 1, 1919, in amount $164,000, which amount represented the book cost. The book cost had Increased on January 1, 1920, to $170,200 in round figures. Our prior approval extends up to this point. The record before us Is silent as to the year 1920, during which time $10,000 of bonds were sold and current indebtedness in like amount was paid. As of January 1, 1921, the fundable indebtedness was as follows: Bonds _ $ 10,000.00 Notes payable 51,641.89 Accounts payable 1,419.28 Between that date and May 31, 1924, the legitimate use of fund* for purposes which warrant the issuance of securities and the sources from which the funds came may be summarized as follows: Use of Funds Gross increase of plant investment $ 38,570.63 Decrease of notes payable 26,684.36 Total $ 64,254.99 </seg>
            <seg id="p436">436 SEVENTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT Sourc«s of Funds Bonds sold I 12,000.00 Decrease in working assets 48.32 Total $ 64,255.99 It will thus be seen that the increase of accounts payable has been brought about by reason of construction. That the construction was providently made, if such a question is in issue here, is shown by the fact that the gross sales in 1919 were $65,200 and in 1923, $92,574. Three purposes are presented for which it is desired to sell bonds: 1. The taking up of bonds not outstanding 2. Paying off uotes payable 3. Paying off construction accounts payable As of date May 31. 1H24. these three items total amount $73, 187. SO. The company has an offer of nin of par for its bonds. It will, therfore, realize $67.5' desires to apply the proceeds from its sal to retire the remainder of the short time indebtedne of such proceeds for new construction and betterrae The evidence indicates, and we so fit which the company desires to issue the serurit are proper corporate purposes. In our order on Application No. 4140, supra, we provided that the company should set aside annually for maintenance and replace- ment purposes an amount of earnings equal to seven n depreciable property. This has approximately been resulted in an increase in four years and a half of such reserve from $21,000 to $60,962. This is apparently caused by the inclusion, under cost of generation, as labor and maintenance, of items which would under other systems of accounting be charged against tins reserve. Apparently this company charges against its reserve for renewals only the cost of larger items of property displaced. The reserve set up during the past four or five years for maintenance and depreciaton exceeds what under the accounting method of the company is a necessary requirement for the protection of the investor, although it may not exceed what the good judgment of the officers thinks should be credited to that account. ncrease of accounts payable Increase of surplus earned and not paid as dividends., ncrease of reserve for renewals and contingencies charged as expense 10,647.88 12,000.00 29.S59.79 </seg>
            <seg id="p437">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 437 It is our understanding that the mortgage will require that fifteen per cent of gross earnings shall be put into the reserve for renewals and contingencies during the life of the bonds, which it is here pro - posed to issue. Because of the general nature of the property, our requirement will be that an amount not less than four per cent of the preciable property shall be annully credited to the reserve for re- newals ami retirements and charged to expense, the charge against which fund to be made only for the retirement at book cost of property istinguished from current maintenance — labor and incidental rials for the upkeep of the plant.

Commissioner The applicant in this case is the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway company, asking for permission to discontinue the employment of an agent and telegraph operator at the town of Gladstone and i therefor a caretaker to serve the people of Gladstone. The ladstune. having a population of about 100, is situated eight west of Fairbury on a state highway. It has two grain elevators, d two stores. A large amount of business has been diverted railway company to trucks so that the less than carload tits have fallen off materially. It was shown by the testimony some wholesale houses at Fairbury where the merchants ne obtain a large amount of their groceries and provisions mm utter them themselves and bringing them into the town or l by truck or auto, and that cream and poultry and other produce are hauled by the citizens tributary to Gladstone directly to Fairbury, aking the less than carload business from the railway corn- reducing the income of the company at that point on the .irloiiil shipments to such an extent that the principal arload business that could be handled by being billed at i Fairbury or by the caretaker or conductor on the train when freight is delivered to the railway company at Gladstone. The following table of figures shows the amount of business done t ( ladstone for the year last past: Ticket sales I 344.46 Telegraph business 12.74 Express 647.62 Freight received 1. c. 1 834.20 Freight forwarded 1. c. 1 150.82 Freight received c. 1 2,499.70 Freight forwarded c. 1 15,751.64 Total earnings of station $ 20,141.18 </seg>
            <seg id="p442">442 SEVENTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT The total expense of the agent at the station was $1,457.04. The bject of the railway company asking for the elimination of a tele - raph operator and agent and the substitution of a caretaker at that tation is to eliminate the expense that the company is to in excess f the amount it would cost to have a caretaker look after the busi - ess at that point, and It was shown by the testimony of the company hat the saving to the company would be approximately $1,100 per ear without material inconvenience to the citizens of Gladstone and he patrons of the road at that town and vicinity. The railway company agreed to furnish a caretaker who would eep the depot open during the business hours and on the arrival and eparture of all scheduled trains, would keep the depot heated and ghted so that it would be comfortable for the traveling public, the ame as if an agent were employed. He would be accessible to the ublic from 8 o'clock a. m. to 6 o'clock p. m. and be at the depot on he arrival and departure of scheduled trains. Telegraph messages received by the agent at Fairbury for parties living in Gladstone and vicinity could be telephoned free of charge to those parties In case the parties have telephones; in case the parties at Gladstone and vicinity have no telephones, the agent at Fairbury could telephone to the caretaker at Gladstone and he could reduce the message to writing and either deliver it in person or deposit it in the podtofftce at Gladstone, addressed to the party for whom it is intended. Telegraph messages could also be telephoned free of charge to Fairbury. k About the only inconvenience to the public would be that they uld be required to pay their fare on the train and that freight and iress would have to be prepaid when shipped to that station. It developed at the hearing that the shippers of grain at that point might desire to have bills of lading signed at the time of the billing at Gladstone, so that they could he taken to the bank and drawn on he firms shipped to through the bank at Gladstone or at other towns adjacent to Gladstone, so that they could obtain credit upon delivery of the bill of lading and sight draft at the bank in which it was de- Kisited. It was shown that unless some arrangements of this kind ould be made, It would be a great inconvenience to the shipper, as t would necessitate shippers going to Fairbury in order to have their )ills of lading signed by the agent for their use at the bank. The railway company agreed that the caretaker or the conductor of the reight train, to whom the car or grain was delivered, would be given authority by the company to sign the bill of lading so that this delay would be obviated.

O. D. packages by the caretaker by consignee paying to the caretaker the amount of C. O. D. and express expense the same as though the caretaker were an agent. Objection was also raised to the fact that parties having baggage to be checked could not have the baggage checked by the agent at the station. The company agreed that the caretaker would put the baggage into the baggage car and that the passengers, after paying their fares to the conductor on the train, would inform the conductor that they had baggage in the baggage car that they desired to have checked to the destination for which they had paid their fares, and the conductor would go into the baggage car and have the baggage - man check the baggage and return a check to the passenger paying the fare. This matter was straightened out to the satisfaction of the citizens of Gladstone. As the business at Gladstone is largely carload business that can be handled without inconvenience to the public by being billed at Fairbury on the east and Gilead or Hebron on the west, by telephone without expense to the shipper or by the caretaker or conductor at the station, this arrangement would make a very material saving to the railway company without material inconvenience to the public, and as the less than carload freight and express shipments and telegraph business is very small and gradually decreasing, It appears to the Commission that the prayer of the applicant should be allowed.

A.NDALL, Commissioner This application was made by the Chicago, Rock Island and ic Railway company to close the station at Mayberry and sub- e therefor a caretaker. Mayberry is located about four and a miles northwest of Steinauer and five and three-tenths miles outheast of Lewiston, both of the two stations mentioned having Rents and telegraph operators. The town of Mayberry consists of itore, a produce store, one grain elevator and a Farmers Union lization which ships stock from that point. The population of i&gt;wn is about 4 0. Some years ago there was a fire in the town lest roved some of the business houses that have not been rebuilt. wing to the fact that the town is so close to other towns that the ry served by this town is quite limited; Burchard is about five south, and Pawnee, the county seat, and a much larger town, i- about 12 miles distant. Owing to the prevalence of good roads, the automobile and truck business at Mayberry has been reduced to such an extent that the less than carload freight ship- rom that point are very limited.

The company makes application to substitute or the services of this agent a caretaker who shall in all respects &gt;erform the services of an agent, with the exceptions of transmitting nd receiving telegraph messages, selling tickets and collecting for relght and express shipments. The object of the railway company asking for the elimination of a telegraph operator and agent and the substitution of a caretaker at hat station is to eliminate the expense that the company is to in excess of the amount it would cost to have a caretaker look after the busi - ness at that point, and it was shown by the testimony of the com - pany that the saving to the company would be approximately $1,100 per year without material inconvenience to the citizens of Mayberry and the patrons of the road at that town and vicinity. The railway company agreed to furnish a caretaker who would keep the depot open during the business hours and on the arrival and departure of all scheduled trains, would keep the depot heated and lighted so that it would be comfortable for the traveling public, the Erne as if an agent were employed. He would be m blic from 8 o'clock a. m. to 6 o'clock p. m. and be at tht e arrival and departure of scheduled trains. Telegraph messages received by the agent at Steinauer for parties living in Mayberry and vicinity could be telephoned free of charge to those parties in case the parties have telephones; in case the parties at Mayberry and vicinity have no telephones, the agent at Steinauer n could telephone to the caretaker at Mayberry and he could reduce the message to writing and either deliver it in person or deposit it in the postoffice at Mayberry, addressed to the party for whom it is intended. Telegraph messages could also be telephoned* free of charge to Steinauer. k About the only inconvenience to the public would be that they ould be required to pay their fare on the train and that freight and :press would have to be prepaid when shipped to that station. It developed at the hearing that the shippers of grail at that point might desire to have bills of lading signed at the time of the billing at Mayberry, so that they could be taken to the bank and drawn on the firms shipped to through the bank at Mayberry or at other towns adjacent to Mayberry. so that they could obtain credit upon delivery of the bill of lading and sight draft at the bank in which it was deposited.

The railway company agreed that the caretaker or the conductor of the freight train, to whom the car of grain was delivered, would be given authority by the company to sign the bill of lading that this delay would be obviated. Objection was also raised by patrons of the road that in many instances C. O. D. express packages could not be received, such as repairs for machinery, automobiles, etc. This matter was straightened out by the express company agreeing to permit the delivery of C. O. D. packages by the caretaker by consignee paying to the caretaker the amount of C. O. D. and express expense the same as though the caretaker were an agent.

            <seg id="p449">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 449 APPLICATION NO. B580 In the Matter of the Application of the Chicago and North Western Railway Company for authority to Close its Station at Houston. TAYLOR. Commissioner: Representing that the gross earnings are insufficient to pay the xpenses of maintaining its station at Houston, the Chicago and North Western Railway company makes application for authority to close its station and install a caretaker in place of an agent. In its showing pporting its application, the company states that the total revenues Ht this station for the year 1923 were $4,896.55. These figures are confirmed by the records in the offices of the Commission. The revenues have been declining for two or three years and figures for the first four months of 1924 indicate that the earnings for this year will not be as large as they were in 19 23. By far the greater portion of revenue in the year 1923, as for preceding years, is made up from carload shipments forwarded from the station. These consist very l;irt:ely of livestock and grain. The less than carload freight, which i' the business requiring most attention from an agent, is very light. Passenger earnings are very small, being but $42.46 for 1923. In May of last year, the total gross revenue at the station was only $2.78. The agent is paid at the rate of fifty-two cents per hour. eight-hour day, so that the salary averages about $115 per » month. It is proposed to secure a caretaker who would keep the station open for the arrival and departure of trains. Billing of freight could be handled at York, which is only five miles distant. The only ness institutions in the town are an elevator and one store, the If being operated by the agent. His wife is also postmistress. r The showing made as to the revenues and expenses of this station •ta so definitely the wisdom of closing the station for purposes ■onomy that the Commission considers it unnecessary to set the matter down for hearing. However, in order that the matter may have ■ trial and that the public served by this station may have an opportunity to protest if they desire, an order approving the closing of the station will be made, effective for sixty days, from July 15, 1924, to September 15, 1924. This will give an opportunity to de - termine whether the maintenance of an agent at this point is un - justified. If the patrons at that station desire to make protest, they should file same not later than September 1, 1924, so that opportunity ran be had for hearing prior to the expiration date of the order.

NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION Thome A. Browne. Chairman Attest: John E. Curtiss. Secretary (SEAL) RANDALL, Commissioner, dissenting This application is an informal application made by II. W. McGinnis in person, presenting a letter by H. E. Dickinson, general superintendent of the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway company. asking authority to close the station at Houston on the Hastings line and install a caretaker instead of an agent. In all cases of this kind since I have been a member of the Com - mission, investigation and hearing has been had by the Commission as o whether or not the prayer of the applicant should be granted. This las been done for the purpose of giving interested parties a chance o be heard and if after a hearing, the Commission has found that the ontentions of the railroad company are just, then the company has been permitted to install a caretaker in place of an agent. By the Commission taking immediate action on this application without the nterested parties being given a chance to be heard, throws the burden of proof upon the citizens of Houston and makes it much more ifficult for them to make a case than if they were given an opportunity n the regular way. From the figures given by the railroad company n the application to close the station, for the amount of business done t that point in 1923, it would look as though the amount of business was small and that possibly the railroad company's prayer should be </seg>
            <seg id="p451">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 451 granted. But that does not change the principle of giving the public a right to be heard. If the Railway Commission would follow the rule that has been followed in this application, the effect would be to discredit the Com - mission as an organization provided for the protection of the public against unreasonable practices of the railroad companies. One of the fundamental principles in law is that every person should have a right to be heard before any court or other body should make a ruling which would affect their rights in any way. If courts should declare a person guilty and then in the sentence embody that the accused after sixty days will have a right to come into court and make a showing and have the judgment set aside providing they could make a sufficient showing, it would be declared illegal, unconstitutional and unfair and I look upon this procedure along the same lines. At the present time the Commission has two cases before it with i nother road where the total amount of income from the stations and the maintaining the stations are very similar, yet, hearing has been set to be held In the depots at those points and after hear - ings have been had and interested parties given a chance to be heard, the cases will be decided upon the evidence and not upon the state - ment of the officers of a railroad or their representatives. s the public to understand that the Hailway Commission ter the interests of t lie people equally with the interests t the railroad companies and does not bring just criticism upon the ction of the Railway Commission for issuing peremptory orders without interested parties being given a chance to be heard. If the citizens of any locality desire a station to be opened by the railroad ompany. the railroad company insists upon a hearing and would be ntitled to one. as no peremptory order by this Commission to open a station would be held legal by the courts until after the railroad com - 1 any had had opportunity to be heard and the decision made upon the evidence. The company making this application for the closing of this depot at Houston, was ordered by the Railway Commission to open a station after hearing had been had. where the business was shown to be five times as much as is being done at station that they request to close, where the population of the village was over one hundred and after hearing was had and the Commission found that the people were entitled to a station at that point, the railroad company appealed from the decision of the Commission to the Supreme Court and the people at that point are without station facilities at this time. If under the law the railway company are entitled to a hearing on the opening of stations, then in my judgment the interested people are entitled to a hearing before a station that has been open to the public for years with an agent, should be made a prepay station and the </seg>

This is in keeping with right and justice to all and in my opinion should be followed in every instance, and I, therefore, cannot join with my colleagues in the order on application by the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway company for the removal of the agent at Houston and the station to be supplied with a caretaker.

It was provided that a hearing would be helil on in the adequacy of such service provided protest should tfore September 1, 1924, by those having business with applicar e station in question. Protest was filed and on September II hearing was held at Houston to determine the merits of continuing the station as a care - taker point. By supplemental order provision was made for continu - ing the caretaker service until our final conclusions. Houston is situated five miles from York by rail and six miles by wagon road, in an angle made by two lines of the Burlington centering at York, the angle being bisected by the North Western. It is an excellent farming community. The town consists of one elevator, a stock yards, a small general mercantile store and three oi four houses. </seg>
            <seg id="p453">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 453 The railroad was built through this point in 1887. Houston has teen an agency station since that time. It became a telephone rather than a telegraph station about 1902 because the rate of pay for non - telegraph stations was lower. Applicant rested its case exclusively on the amount of business being done as opposed to the cost of maintaining an agent at that point. Patrons advanced two chief considerations in support of the advis - ability of restoring the agent; first, that constant reduction in amount of service was not good business for the carrier because it drove busi - ness to the competing Burlington points on either side, and, second, that when the railroad was constructed the township voted bonds as an aid in construction under the actual or implied promise that a station would be maintained in the township. The territory naturally tributary to Houston as a shipping point is limited by the location of the adjacent lines of the Burlington and by the dominating influence of the city of York close by. It can not be a heavy shipping point. The territory surrounding Houston is served by the telephone company owning the exchange at York, with which town there is free service at the monthly rate paid. The story of the carrier is a familiar one, representing advanc- g costs of doing business without corresponding increases in venues. At Houston this is illustrated by the following tabulation: The business done at a station like this fluctuates violently from year to year, dependent upon the results from growing crops. The vast proportion of the business is carload. A few years ago one of the agent's chief duties was in handling passenger traffic. The pas - senger traffic at points like Houston has dwindled greatly, as Illus - trated by the following: &lt;&lt;ar Afgpnt's Salary * et Earnii 915 916 922 923 $ 570 570 1318 1384 * 5346 7136 8069 3795 'asscnjjor •"jinungs. fears .909 .910 911 912 .920 .921 .922 .923 .924 (8 months Ticket Sal. $266.14 243.431 205.505 245.98 114.26 79.20 76.25 39.04 29.44 </seg>
            <seg id="p454">454 SEVENTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT The chief business at the station is the outbound shipment of grain and livestock, with grain predominating. The grain dealer testified that absence of an agent did not disturb him as he has direct connection with the agent at York. He has been at Houston seven years. Using his approximations of the freight paid on his shipments of grain, it will be seen that the remaining business consisting of livestock, other carload shipments such as coal, and the total lea than-carload business, is small. This is illustrated by the following tabulation: Revenue from Revenue from other Year grain .shipped Total revenue than grain bosinesH 1918 $ 3900 $ 5870 $ 1970 1919 2400 6206 3606 1920 26(Mi 7036 4436 1921 SOOU 121*7 6307 1922 5700 8069 2369 1923 1600 3755 Iltl Six witnesses were called by protestants against non-ageucy classification of the station. Of these, four offered r concrete illustration of disadvantages under the pr fifth witness testified that he greatly missed the aid making out shipping bills on livestock. A sixth witness had had IV less-than carload shipments within have been handled much mo Testimony centered about the poor &lt; ond with particular reference to the lack of windmill and tar fence which in some mysterious manner appeared to hav structed in such manner as to make access to the stock yards It was alleged that lack of an agent had caused some shipper their livestock to Mapps or to Waco on the Burling alleged that the lack of windmill and tank was the chief reason for ceasing to ship livestock from Houston. The record shows t hat live atock shipments from Houston have ranged from nine to forty-onf cars per annum in the past thirteen years, with average shipments per annum of twenty-one cars. The records of the Commission show the livestock shipments from Mapps have been increasing since 1920. while those from Houston have not. The same comparison is generally true as to Waco. It is the allegation of witnesses in this case that those differing results are due to lack of proper facilities at Houston. This case involved only the question of whether the station should be operated as agency or non-agency station. We are convinced that the service at the stock yards is not what it should be. This case is not broad enough to enter an order respecting the stock yards. We will however expect the company to give due attention to the com- plaints and to make such changes as the facts warrant to the end </seg>
            <seg id="p455">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 455 that reasonable stock shipping facilities may be at hand and to the further end that applicant may hold a reasonable share of this com - petitive business. Failing to make every reasonable effort to keep the earnings at a station at a maximum, the carrier cannot be heard complain in the future that such revenues demand continuance of stricted station service. Not later than three months from date of this order, carrier will port as to what it has done to improve the stock yards facilities. In the absence of such report the Commission will make its own in - vestigation. Within the last few months we have authorized this carrier to change from agency to non-agency stations at Carlisle and at Mart - land, points very similar to Houston and with approximately the same amount of business. Hope of consistant reduction in the cost of transportation to shippers lies in high efficiency and rigid economy in cost of opera - tion. This economy can only result when no money is spent where it can be reasonably avoided. Under present conditions and the evidence that is before us we do not feel warranted in requiring the carrier to restore the agent at Houston. We will however, expect that the caretaker should be instructed in the simple principles of making out bills of lading in order that shippers sending out carload freight at unusual intervals, may have some aid. It will also be expected that instructions be issued to the caretaker to check on the less than carload freight in the freight room and ascertain clearly whether consignee knows of the arrival of such freight. Whether this station can continue to operate without an agent will depend upon the care with which the company handles its business at that point. For the time being we will not require the restoration of the agent.

The cost of reproduction, plus development cost, is found to be $1,817,910, exclusive of new construction proposed, while the depreciated, or present value on this basis, is fixed at $1,615,546. Applicant con - tends that the latter figure represents a conservative value of the properties they are acquiring and should be used as a measure of the reasonableness of the amount of the securities for which they ask approval. The following question by attorney for applicant and answer by an engineer representing applicant is indicative of this position: "Q. Do you consider this appraisal is accurate and such that a prospective buyer can rely on it in determining how much he should pay for the property covered by the appraisal?" "A. Yes sir, in fact I think we have established as good a record as any engineering firm, for the reason in the financing of these properties and many other similar properties we always represent the investment side so as to safeguard the investment. We have built up a reputation where people bringing issues insist upon our report either in the form of a reproduction cost showing depreciation, or in many cases such reports studied as showing the possibility of what the company earns on extensions and things of that kind." </seg>
            <seg id="p458">458 One of the properties being purchased, that of the Spink County 'ower company, Is in the hands of a receiver and will be acquired t receiver's sale, providing a committee of creditors approve. The pringfleld Light &amp; Power company, while not in the hands of a eceiver, is unable to meet its obligations and the proposed transfer will avoid a receivership. Mr. C. B. Zeigier, treasurer of applicant ompany, who has handled most of the negotiations tor these roperties, testified (p. 4 3 record) with reference to this property: "The principal reason for the low price on this property is the fact that its net earnings for the last year were five hundred dollars, due to its obsolete and inadequate power stations con - tinually breaking down and only recently was out of commission entirely for a couple weeks." The Springfield plant is being purchased tor $52,OUO. The estimate of present value made by the engineer is $ ISO. 04 2. The p agreed upon for the Spink County system as shown above is $4 while the engineer has placed a value upon it of $li&gt; excess of the engineer's estimate of present value over t purchase price is $533,536. In other words, had applicant made offer tc the owners of these properties on the basis of the engine they would have paid over one-half million dollars mor are actually paying after negotiation It is a curious commer tthe business judgment of the men controlling t y are willing to sell them for approximately 6 applicant's engineers say they are worth. We cannot belit ten engaged in the electric light industry in torly advised as to the worth of their own pr trary we are driven to the conclusion that the hig engineer are the result of unusually liberal allowances, with too little consideration being condition of the properties. The engineer st cent to 21 per cent. At that, however, the allowances are in exce the average authorized by this Commission. His allowance for de velopment cost run the percentage for the general overhead elemt to above 31 per cent. The amount in dollars of his allowance for development cost is $165,000. It is significant that under the theory applied by the engineer in estimating this item he uses the same allowance for the bankrupt properties as for those earning a sub- stantial net profit. kThe average depreciation in the property as determined by the gineer amounts to 12% per cent. It is admitted, as we have shown, it some of the property acquired is obsolete and inadequate. It :riticisms of his allowances for general expenditures in our opinion in the previous applications referred to he was more conservative, in :his instance reducing the percentage from approximately 15 per u </seg>
            <seg id="p459">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 459 also clear that a considerable portion of the property will require (instruction to make the merger into one unit possible. This will esult in abandonment and replacements. The existing generating lants have value as stand-by auxiliaries. It is doubtful, however. whether they should be accorded the consideration that seems to have been given by the engineer. There is a possibility that applicant is using some of these plants at a bargain and that it is in position through the plan of consolidation to operate them at much better advantage than the present owners. Whatever sacrifice is made by the owners would be reflected in the estimates submitted by the engineers. On the other hand it is not unlikely that a premium d for some of the properties, although the figures sub- mitted by the engineer do not so indicate. We are of the opinion, however, that the market value of properties of this character should not differ so radically from a reproduction cost depreciated. It is inconceivable that engineers have a knowledge of value so superior len who have actually invested their money in the enter- The inventory submitted by applicant is of value in reaching our conclusions, while the appraisal affords the only guide post from which to get bearings. We are concerned chiefly with the purchase price of the property, and inquire further to ascertain if the transac - tions are without fraud, or pronounced extravagance. The purchase price here is so far under the rather extravagant appraisal as to indicate that it is not excessive to the point of preventing our approval f the securities. In the course of the hearing, however, applicant sked that the surplus of property claimed as a result of the engineer's valuation be used to fulfill a requirement of the order in Application No. 5462 and 5463, supra. In that case the Commission expressed doubt as to whether the value of the property was sufficient to support the issue of securities asked for, whereupon the company agreed to invest capital in additions, betterments and extensions to that property in the amount of $250,000 prior to December 31, 1925, which it was agreed would not thereafter be made the basis of issues of bonds, debentures or preferred stock. Applicant now asks that the surplus in the property over and above the amount of securities asked for be applied to fulfill the requirement as described above. In view of what we have said relative to the physical valuation, however, we are of the opinion that this request should be denied. It was the purpose of the Commission in making the requirement of the previous order that actual money to the amount of $250,000 should be invested in the property. It was not the intention that intangible values of un - certain amount represented by enhancement in prices, estimates of going concern, development costs, etc., could be used as a substitute.

OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE. Chairman Applicant is a Nebraska corporation, organized under the laws e state of Nebraska for the purpose of generating and selling electric current for light, heat and power purposes. It desires authority under the provisions of section 676, R. S. 1922, to issue First mortgage seven per cent bonds due in 1934 in par ant $40,000; mmon stock par value $100 per share In amount $100,000 Applicant corporation desires to purchase for common stock in amount mentioned, the existing electric business at Cedar Rapids. This property consists of a hydro-electric development, stand-by in - ternal combustion power equipment, generators, switch boards and other accessories located in an adequate power house, a direct current distributing system in the town of Cedar Rapids, and the business of furnishing electric current at wholesale to the towns of Greeley and Wallmch. With the proceeds from the sale of the bonds it is desired make important betterments in the plant in order to be in a posi - ii to supply the electric current necessary to a largely increasing markc Van Ackeren brothers purchased in 1911 a small water power evelopment at Cedar Rapids operating a mill and selling a small mount of electric current for domestic consumption, at the same time that they purchased a lumber yard and an elevator in the same town. For years these properties were operated together in a partner - ship. Considerable improvements were made to the electric properties. In 1922 all the properties were put into one corporation entitled Van Ackeren Brothers. With the development of a larger market for current at Wolbach and Greeley and prospects of still further develop - ment, the need for additional capacity was apparent and a method of financing was developed. As a result a new corporation was formed which is applicant in this case. The stockholders in the new cor - poration will be the same as in the corporation of 1922 but the properties which will be acquired by the new corporation will not include the lumber yard and elevator business. </seg>
            <seg id="p470">470 After much negotiation, applicant has received an offer of $32,000 net to it for these bonds, a price which will make the money cost the company in excess of nine per cent per annum. This is a very high rate but the officers of applicant corporation prefer to pay so high a rate rather than to issue and sell common stock for cash. In support of the application for the issue of capital liabilities in amount $140,000 applicant offered an appraisal with prices attached, which appraisal presents only the depreciated values show - ing total fixed assets of $77,574 at this time and claimed intangible assets in amount $54,130. To this it would add in construction the proceeds from the sale of the bonds. It therefore claims a value for its properties, tangible and intangible, of approximately $164,000 at the date of the application. Hearing was held on the application on September 13. 1924. The Commission was not entirely satisfied with the evidence there obtained and adjourned the hearing while its engineer could make ■ personal inspection of the properties. At the adjourned hearing on October is the results of the Commission's engineer's appraisal were put into the record. His report excluded the intangible factors except the general overhead expenditures in the sum r i include contingencies, interest during construction, organization. d commissions on securing money. He arrived at a figure of 00,921. He made no effort to ascertain the value of the water - ;ht although admitting such value existed. He found no fault with 5 unit prices used by applicant in his inventory but readjusted the ed assets in order to eliminate some property which iu his estima - n would disappear in the new construction program. These changes count for the difference between the figures of applicant and of th&lt; - mmission's engineer. Applicant had included the water-right at 7,500. The Commission has recognized that water-right rue which can frequently be measured iu dollars. Applicant's plant excellently located and has natural power advantages not usually illy found in Nebraska. It has been able to harness the water power at a less cost than could have been done if these natural advantages of location did not exist. The value of the water power would be to a considerable extent, dependent upon the use to which it is put. Applicant is just beginning to develop a market justifying full use of the water power advantages. It might be unfair to attempt to place a value on the water-rights at this time. tThis property will be a close corporation. The stockholders do intend to issue and sell other stock to the general public. The unt of stock therefore outstanding is not so Important as under </seg>

We find that the proposed bond issue is reasonably necessary to secure the cash funds to make the improve - ments now necessary in order that applicant can supply the market at hand.

It is not necessary to analyze the exhibits in detail here.

Chairman Applicant Continental Gas &amp; Electric Corporation asks briefly that the Commission give its approval to a general plan which will ultimately result in the complete amalgamation of the Lincoln Gas &amp; Electric company and The Lincoln Traction company and asks further that specific approval be fdven to the first step in perfection of that consolidation; namely, the acquisition by purchase of such proportion of the capital stock of The Lincoln Traction company as will give it control of that corporation. The proceedings before the Commission are brought under the provisions of section 3. article 10, of the constitution of the state of Nebraska. The portion of that section relating to the subject matter reads: "No public utility corporation or common carrier shall con - solidate its stock, property, franchise, or earnings in whole or in part with any other public utility corporation or common carrier owning a parallel or competing property without permission of the Railway Commission;" No protest has been lodged by anyone having a financial interest in the properties it is proposed to consolidate. All parties entering appearance at the hearing held on Saturday, September 27, in the offices of the Commission, including the representatives of municipali - ties interested, expressed themselves for various reasons as favorable to the ultimate object set forth In the application. Testimony, more or less convincing, as to the corporate and public advantages flowing from a consolidation was presented by the </seg>
            <seg id="p476">476 SEVENTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT president of applicant company and by the president of the company whose stock It is proposed shall be purchased. As respects The Lincoln Traction company the interests of stock - lolders and of the public are somewhat the same, because upon the nancial soundness of that corporation depends in considerable meag - re adequate continued public service being furnished by it. The nancial difficulties of this corporation are well known. It has for ears found itself unable to finance all necessary improvements. It as a closed mortgage on the physical properties in amount $1,500, - 00 of which amount $1,200,000 is in the hands of the general public, 'he market price of these bonds is such that it would be extremely nsound to dispose of the remainder of the bonds. They are at present sed as collateral security for borrowings on short-time notes. For le past several years this corporation has approximately earned its (referred stock dividends in addition to its fixed charges. It has een unable to pay these earnings out as cash dividends because it Es been compelled to use the money for necessary improvem has compensated the stockholders in large part by a stock divi thorized by this Commission, but such compensation does not. it light of all facts, stabilize the market pTice of the At the present time this corporation is approximat fixed charges and preferred stock dividends.

I Capital difficulties have caused inability to operate as It otherwise might operate. If this situation grows present standards of service would be jeopard T Interested in the service — the stockholder primarily in the future of his investment. From the public point of rtow this ronsolidation is advisable if it will result in stronger financial connections enabling the owners to bring about lessened costs by modern equipment. Applicant company in the electrical field has been developing rapidly in Nebraska and has shown itself thus far as able to command the necessary finances for development. Nothing indicates that it cannot continue in this favor - able position. Consolidation of these utilities competing in the electric field uld definitely result as shown by the record, in </seg>

Potential reduction of overhead costs. Potential reduction in charges to the public. Loss to the stockholder will result from the charging out from ant of duplicated property displaced. It might be urged that elimination of competition will result in ~s keen efforts on the part of the utility to the disadvantage of the nsuming public. This is a possibility if regulation is inadequate. &gt;mpetition, however, remains. No justification appears to exist for incy in approving the consolidation on such possibilities of vantage weighed against the designated and known advantages. The Commission is unanimously of the opinion that the general of complete ultimate consolidation should receive our approval approval is bottomed upon the assumption that so rapidly as &gt;my will justify, progress in complete amalgamation shall be made. The mere purchase of a controlling interest in one corpora - tion by the other, not followed by physical consolidation and ultimately by corporate consolidation, would not justify our approval. A part of the application is that we shall approve the contract for the purchase of a controlling interest by applicant company of the stock of The Lincoln Traction company, this being represented as the first step in bringing about the ultimate complete consolidation. The question has been raised as to whether this purchase requires the approval of the Commission or falls within the duties of the Com - mission contemplated by the constitutional provision. It has been urged that the purchase is a purely private transaction and is not a consolidation of stock. The purpose of the constitutional provision seems to be that actual and potential competition between public utility corporations shall not be eliminated without the interests of </seg>
            <seg id="p478">478 the public being safeguarded through proceedings before the Railway Commission. In the present instance a controlling interest of two competing public utilities is placed in the hands of one corporation through stock transfers. There is a consolidation of the voting power of the stock and thereby undoubtedly the elimination of competition without the stated advantages, thus far, of physical consolidation. The Commission believes that this situation falls within the ion - ■titutional provision requiring approval. Even though that view might be too broad, there still rwilIlM the fact that the purchase of this stock is the first step of a Mrtw of steps which will bring about complete consolidation, corporate and physical, of the two companies. Representing the public interest, the Commission cannot ignore any of the steps and from that point of view it appears essential that we first step.

This Commission has frequently said that the statute under which his application is filed gives it the authority and makes it its duty o scrutinize reasonably the purchase price and the bona fide nature of the transaction in order to arrive at a conclusion as to whether the securities Issues are reasonably necessary for corporate purposes. Pursuant to this position of the Commission the company has not only filed a copy of its contract of purchase but two appraisals of the property, based on cost of reproduction at present prices, together wth a consideration of the depreciation Involved. tThe Boyer appraisal shows direct reproduction cost in amount 259,955 and overhead costs including cost of financing in amount 53,290. kThe King appraisal shows direct cost of reproduction at present ces of the physical property in amount $254,347 and overhead costs construction of the physical property in amount $4 4,511.

            <seg id="p483">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 483 imed that it is reasonably accurate for the earlier life of the company. The statement indicates a gross value of the physical plant, just subsequent to the purchase by applicant, of $273, - 65 5 against which there was set up in reserve a considerable amount for ret irements. Annlicanr alleees that the deterioration exisiine in Applicant alleges that the deterioration existing in ioes not exceed ten per cent. The engineer for the Commission testified that this was too conservative a figure, basing M upon the obsolete nature of the steam stand-by power ml its practical elimination as necessary equipment. Applicant insisted that this stand-by power equipment will be essen- i; years to come and that it is its purpose immediately nto shape for instant reserve use Commission's engineer called attention to the fact that the laid claim to certain city pole lines where as a matter of fact the poles were owned by the telephone company and attachment rights merely leased by applicant. The terms of this lease are so that it is probable that an intangible value equal to the it ii rroneously included in the inventory, may be said to exist as a matter of purchase and sale. If this is true the results would be tht&lt; nlthn prrnnpnnslv stuterl in flip inivnlnrv :mH nnnmisinl Itho erroneously stated in the inventory and appraisal Applicant also lays claim to a value of approximately $15,000 because the city of Indianola had constructed a transmission line to rrtea from applicant and entered into a contract giving appli - right to serve private customers intermediate. We think the n this point extremely strained and do not regard this ti tr in line as an element of value entering into the purchase rutiny of the value of the physical plant we must reject th. overhead item in the Boyer inventory for cost of financing. It is a hypothetical figure where it might readily have been an accurate figure. There is an incidental cost to financing over and above the discounts to be amortized, but where that cost can be ascertained, it is not permissable to use a hypothetical figure. This Commission has frequently said that overhead costs of fiiteen per cent are reason - able. If the two inventories are adjusted to this overhead figure, the cost of reproducing the physical property at the present time would fall slightly below $300,000. This figure is important when compared with the gross book cost of the plant in amount $273,655, which includes certain construction at pre-war values. It has been the constant purpose of this Commission in con - sideration of securities issues for purchase of properties, to go no farther in ascertaining the fair value of the physical properties than is essential in reaching reasonable conclusions. From a consideration of the above data it is clear that the physical properties exclusive of the intangible values attaching are worth somewhere between $250, - 000 and $275,000 net. </seg>
            <seg id="p484">484 For this property applicant has contracted to pay $375,000 in cash. The testimony indicates that this contract was entered into after an inspection of the property, but before its careful appraisal. The dominant factor in the sale price was the earning power of the properties during the last several years under rates fixed by the city council. The last adjustment of these rates took place in February, .924. No rate controversy exists. It is not necessary to go into detail concerning the showing of gross and net earnings during the past several years. It is sufficient to say that those earnings at the present ime and the prospects for the future, so far as they can be now seen, justify the purchase price. That is, the net earnings available after all operating expenses are paid and an adequate reserve for retirements has been set aside, will earn a fair rate on the purchase price. This statement excludes what might be the earning situation under different but legal rates. It is clear that applicant has paid a considerable amount for nch intangible values as attach to the property, in the opinion of both purchaser and seller, because of the earning power. That in - tangible value purchased appears to have cost applicant approxi - mately $100,000. No question exists but what the transaction was &gt;ona fide and that purchaser believes the intangible value to he worth his much. The organizers of the company through the parent organ - zation. are putting cash into the property representing this junior claim on the properties. The nature of the organization of holding and subsidiary corporation makes it quite essential that this stock be closely held. There is small liability that it will reach the hands of the public. If the Commission is to limit its approval of securities to pay for a purchase of properties, to a consideration of the physical property exclusive of the immediate and past earning power, it is obvious that no prosperous properties could change hands, as the seller would de - mand a price somewhat dependent upon the earning power, and the mrchaser would not be willing to advance the cash for the purchase of this intangible and possibly variable item with no securities to show for such advance. It appears to be a proper procedure that much weight be given to the conclusions of the men who are putting their money into the &gt;roperty. At the same time the cases of purchase of electric properties at what seems to be high figures, has led this Commission to the conclusion that the books of the purchaser should show clearly what t has bought and the balance sheet carried forward by the purchaser should show similar data. To this end the Commission will attach a condition to its approval of the securities asked for, that the gross plant account of the selling company, prima facie accurate evidence of the original cost of the existing properties, shall be carried for- </seg>

Applicant asked us to authorize 1500,000 of common stock to represent cash put in over and above the proceeds of the bonds, amounting to about $137,500. This demand was not strongly urged in testimony. In our opinion the present earning power of the com - pany when taken in connection with the large purchase price war - rants keeping the amount of stock as low as practicable. On an earn - ing basis this stock should sell at par. On consideration of the pur - chase price the intangible factors in the assets are so considerable as to warrant disapproval of any additional item representing discount on stock.

It is pro - posed that as a Sunday substitute the equipment of No. 310 leave Oak - dale as part of a mixed train at 10:45 a. m. arriving at Scribner at 6:50 p. m. and being picked up by No. 2 of the main line leaving Scribner at 7:40 p. m. and arriving in Omaha at 10:30 p. m. The purpose of the proposed aubstitution is to reduce passenger train operating expense. The freight train from Scribner to Oak - dale and Oakdale to Scribner, doing no local work except in carloads, operates at the present time. The effect of mixed train service would be to remove practically the entire expense of passenger trains on Sunday. The Commission sent about forty notices to the towns which might be affected by the proposed change, asking for indica - tion as to whether a hearing was desired. Some objection was registered by the towns west of Albion but no requests for a hearing. At our request carrier filed a statement of the passenger business done on the Sunday trains during November. It shows a total earning on five Sundays of $166.05. This is an earning from passenger service of 14 He per train mile, representing traffic of four passengers per train mile. It is clear that the train during that month at least was not used to a sufficient extent to warrant continuance. The proposed change would make the hours of service for those who desire to ride the train between points east of Humphrey dis- </seg>
            <seg id="p488">488 SEVENTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT agreeable on westbound movement and would improve the time of travel on east bound movement at points west of Humphrey. Express service would not be materially affected. Mail service would be at a more favorable hour at points east of Albion and less favorable at points west of Albion. Whether the proposal would furnish reasonably adequate service under all the circumstances is open to question. It cannot be deter - mined in advance of trial. The service would, of course, be less desirable to passengers than the present service. Much would depend upon the promptness with which the mixed train makes the trip and the ability to meet the published schedules. It is very difficult, how - ever, to Justify the operation of a train on a passenger revenue of 14V4c per train mile. The out-of-pocket cost apparently approxi - mates three times the earnings from all sources by this train. It is not essential that every train be operated on a paying basis. It is essential that no passenger trains be operated for which there is not reasonable necessity. Whether there is reasonable necessity here will depend upon the success of an experiment. UWe will approve the application for an experimental period bject to conditions set out in the order below. OKDKIt IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway company be and it hereby is authorized, effective Sunday. December 14, to sub - stitute for present Sunday passenger train service on the Scribner- Oakdale branch, a mixed train with schedule to leave Scribner at approximately 3:00 a. m., to arrive at Oakdale at 10:35 a. m., to leave Oakdale at 10:45 a. m. and arrive at Scribner at 6:50 p. m., subject to the following conditions: (a) The changed service shall be for an experimental period to March 1, 1925. If protests are lodged with the Commission against the adequacy of the service on or before February 20th, hearing will t&gt;e held and final order entered, based on the facts there developed, before the terminating date of this temporary order. (b) Applicant will carry on the mixed train, equipment approxi - mately equivalent to the present passenger train equipment, such equipment to be operated between Oakdale and Omaha so change of cars is not necessary at Scribner. (c) Reasonably adequate methods shall be used for heating the passenger coach equipment while in mixed train service. </seg>

Powell, rate expert FINDINGS AND ORDER BY THE COMMISSION: tThis case came on for hearing on an application by the Burling- Kailroad to establish the following rule on certain carload ship - ts of sand and gravel: "Charges on cars not weighed on track scales will be assessed on weight of 110% of marked capacity of car." At the hearing, representatives of all of the carriers operating in Nebraska asked to be made parties to the application except the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha Railway company. The Omaha road was notified of the formal hearing. Representatives of receivers of sand and gravel from Omaha and Lincoln were strongly represented at the hearings in opposition to any change in the rules now in effect on those occasional cars which the carrier is unable to weigh on account of the disability of track The carriers presented extensive exhibits covering different eriods of time which showed the weight on all of the carloads of ■and and gravel received at Lincoln and Omaha. The Burlington's bowing covered a total of 685 cars for the month of October, 1924, received at Omaha and 660 cars at Lincoln, for the same month. The weights were shown for 171 cars delivered by the Burlington to re - eivers of sand and gravel at Council Bluffs, Iowa, forwarded from Cone's Spur) Yutan, Nebraska, covering a period of time from Ma; to October 31, 1924. Other carriers introduced similar exhibits. The purpose of these exhibits were to show that the average loading f sand or gravel was in excess of 110% of the marked capacity of he car. All of this testimony is related to shipments moving to estinations where track scales are provided, and, according to the estlmony of the miners of sand, are not representative of the loading f cars of sand and gravel consigned to stations where the cars can - not be scaled either In transit or at final destination. Representatives of the carriers stated that it was their desire have the rule apply on shipments of sand or gravel on the occasional </seg>
            <seg id="p491">491 car delivered at Omaha or Lincoln that is not weighed on account of the scales being out of commission. The representatives of receivers of sand and gravel at Omaha and Lincoln contend that if the rule is so applied it will have the effect of canceling the minimum weight provision which is now in effect on all cars that are set for unloading without previously being weighed. MIXERS' POSITION Some of the miners of sand opposed the granting of the applica - tion as made by the carriers for the reason that they were afraid that if the rule was authorized by the Commission the carriers would fail to weigh a larger number of cars than they have done in the past, and thereby assess charges on an estimated basis; that the general practice of the miners at the present time is to invoice the sand or gravel to the buyer on the railroad weights; that it is impossible to estimate the weight of the contents of a car of sand or gravel closer than from four to eight or ten tons of the actual contents of the car; that the condition of the trade and the number of orders on the miners' books had considerable to do with the ability of the miners to load the proper weight in a car; that they were of the opinion that if some new rule is to be established for the purpose of assessing freight charges on carloads of sand or gravel that cannot be weighed on account of no track facilities between point of origin and destina - tion, a rule should be provided that would allow the carriers to assess freight charges on the weight invoiced to the buyers by the miners, giving due consideration to the minimum weights, and to cars loaded to the full visible capacity, as now provided in the carrier's tariffs; that in case of controversy between the miners, buyers or carriers the contents of the car should be determined by measurement, and the application of uniform per cubic yard or cubic foot weights determined by the Commission in these proceedings; that the Inability of the miner to estimate the amount of load in a car closer than six to eight or ten tons was caused largely by the use of gondola cars with hopper dump bottoms and foreign cars of unusual measurements with regard to the marked capacity of the car; and that the present rules and tariff provisions should be continued on all cars that pass through or terminate at stations where track weights can be secured q Other miners testified that they are now operating under the 110% rate; that the bulk of their shipments are going to destina - tions that are not provided with track scales; that they invoice the sand on the same weights that they enter on the railroad bills of lading; that they are able to estimate the contents of the car satis - factorily to their customers and themselves. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Commission required the carriers to file an exhibit that would show the number of cars that </seg>
            <seg id="p492">492 were delivered by the carriers which were not weighed on account of no facilities being available as compared with the total number of cars of sand and gravel handled in Nebraska for the same period as shown in the carriers' exhibits which were delivered at destinations where railroad weights were secured. The exhibit so filed shows that there were 567 cars which were delivered without weighing which equals 23.42 per cent of the total cars of sand and gravel handled during the period. CONCLUSIONS The resolution in this case was entered on account of an informal complaint filed with the Commission that the Burlington had issued bulletin to their agents that the freight charges on all cars of sand gravel that had not been track scaled, should be assessed on the asis of 110% of the marked capacity of the car. The attention of te Burlington was called to the fact that this bulletin had the effect changing the charges assessed on cars not scaled and such change uld not be made without the authority of the Commission. The nquiry of the Commission related to the charges on carload ship - ents of sand or gravel which could not be weighed by the carriers n account of no facilities available, and was not in regard to the ccasional car of sand that is delivered without being weighed at tations where track scale facilities are located. It is to the interest carriers to maintain scales in good operating condition. If. for any ason, they should fail to do so, and shippers are injured, complaint ould be filed. The possibility of such contingency, however, is very mote. If the application was to be granted as asked for i. e. assess the targes on all cars of sand or gravel that do not pass through or rminate at stations where track scale facilities are provided on .0% of the marked capacity of the car, the effect of the rule would e to establish a minimum and maximum charge on all such cars, his would have the effect of allowing a minimum weight of the marked capacity of the car on all shipments moving through r to stations where track scale facilities are available and deny the pplication of such a rule on all shipments that could not be weighed n account of the failure of the carriers to provide track scales. Track scales are expensive to install, maintain, and operate and the Commission does not think that the assessment of charges on car - load shipments of sand and gravel alone should be a sufficient reason for them to order the carriers to install such scales, so that all cars of sand or gravel could be scaled. We do not think that the showing made by the carriers of the weights on cars of sand or gravel delivered at Lincoln, Omaha and </seg>
            <seg id="p493">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 493 Council Klu Us are representative of the weights of cars loaded and delivered to stations where track weights can not be secured. One of the witnesses for the miners testified that he had loaded hundreds of cars that had been delivered without being scaled and that he had no serious controversy with the buyers or the carrier as to the con - tents of the car. In Application No. 5512 made by the Chicago, St. Paul, Minne - apolis &amp; Omaha Railway company we authorized the following esti - mated weights to apply on carload shipments of sand and gravel moving in Nebraska intrastate traffic that did not pass through or (lnstinate at stations where track scales were provided. Sand 2900 pounds per cubic yard 3000 pounds per cubic yard Gravel In the findings entered by the Commission in the application mentioned in this paragraph it is stated that the department of public works of this state has agreed that gravel weighs approximately 3000 pounds per cubic yard, and sand approximately 2800 pounds per cubic yard and that both commodities vary in weight somewhat de - 1 ••tiding upon the moisture content. The Commission is of the opinion and so finds that the estimated weights mentioned in this paragraph should be used as a basis for estimating weights as provided in the order in this case. If it develops that further consideration should be given to the estimated weights herein provided the matter can be set down for further investigation by the Commission. It was shown of record by the rate department of the Commission that the Burlington's book of rules, which govern its conductors and station agents, provides the following rule as to cars handled which cannot be weighed, rule No. 52, page 51. "When carload freight, forwarded from and destined to sta - tions having no track scales, and there are no intermediate track scales, agents must ascertain from shippers, the gross weight, and, if satisfied that it is correct will way-bill accordingly." The above quoted rule appears to the Commission to be a reason - able method for finding the charges which should be collected by the carriers on carload shipments of sand or gravel that originate, pass through, or terminate at stations where no track scale facilities are provided, the above quoted rule to be supplemented by a measure - ment rule which would provide a method of finding the contents of a car in case of controversy between the carriers, consignees or con - signors. The Commission is of the opinion and so finds that such a rule should be established by the carriers operating in this state. I'nder the state and federal statutes "false billing" is punishable </seg>
            <seg id="p494">494 by heavy penalties, which will in our opinion, fully safe-guard the carriers' revenue. At the present time the tariffs of the carriers provide that on arload shipments of sand or gravel where the car is loaded to the ull visible capacity, the actual weight shall be taken, subject to a minimum of 40,000 pounds, on all cars where track scales are avail - ble. It appears to the Commission and we so find that a similar rule hould be provided on cars that cannot be weighed on account of no acilities available. The Commission is of the opinion and further nds that the minimum weight rule as provided on cars that can be eighed, should apply as a minimum on cars that cannot be weighed. An order in accordance with these findings will be entered.

Notice of the hearing was sent to a number of individual Omaha firms and the Omaha Chamber of Commerce. The interested indus - ries represented at the hearing were the Omaha Ice &amp; Cold Storage mpany, hereinafter called the Omaha Ice company, and the Lake - de Ice company, hereinafter called the Lakeside company. Both of iese companies have ice houses located on Cut-Off lake which is lo - cated in east Omaha approximately eight miles from the Union Pacific ummit yards which is the receiving and breaking-up yards for the nion Pacific in Omaha. The Lakeside company's ice house is located n the west arm of Cut-Off lake about six miles from Summit. The maha Ice company maintains two ice houses located approximately wo miles east of the Lakeside company and about eight miles from le Summit yards. The petition of the applicant reads as follows "and it is their desire to establish a rate of $6.75 per car on all traffic originating on. or destined to Union Pacific tracks located in the city of Omaha, north of the north side of Locust street, covering what is known as t lie Carter Lake switching dis - trict, city of Omaha. The only traffic involved worthy of mention is ice. The $6.75 to be our share of all traffic whether it moves 'intra-terminal'. "inter-terminal' or service performed in con- nection with the line haul. " Union Pacific switching tariff G. F. O., 105-C provides for the following charges for switching cars between industries located on Cut-Off lake and the transfer tracks of connecting carriers. Intra - plant. inter-terminal when performed in connection with a connecting carrier line haul, inter-terminal where no line service is performed; Intra-terminal in Omaha yards. Item No. 10 to tariff 105-C reads as follows: "The Terms Intra-Plant. Intra-Terminal and Inter-Terminal Switching Defined. The terms Intra-Plant, Intra-Terminal and Inter-Terminal Switching, are denned as follows: Intra-Plant Switching — A switching movement from one track to another within the same plant or industry. Intra-Terminal Switching — A switching movement (other than intra-plant switching) from one track to another of the same road within the switching limits of one station or industrial switching district. Inter-Terminal Switching — A switching movement from a track of one road to a track of another road when both tracks are within the switching limits of the same station or industrial switching district." </seg>
            <seg id="p497">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 497 Item 910 reads as follows: "Intra-Terminal Switching at Omaha, Neb. — The Intra- Terminal (see Item 10) switching rate between industries on Union Pacific R. R., located in the Omaha Yard, is $8.30 per car." Item No. 380 of the above mentioned tariff provides switching rates as follows: "Switching Charges in Dollars per car between industries shown in first column and track connections of Connecting Line* shown below: Groups A and B are described as follows "Group A rates apply when added to rates for a line haul and represent a separate charge for terminal service. Group B rates apply when movement is Inter-Terminal (See Item 10). Figures shown herein represent the charges of the Union Pacific Railroad for their portion of the inter-terminal movement, the minimum charge on the through movement will be $6.30 per car." Item No. 900 provides rates for switching movement between five specifically named districts and connecting lines. These charges are as follows: "Carload Switching Rates between Industries on Union Pacific R. R., located in the Omaha yard. The following rates apply only when the switching service is performed in connection with a line haul." The rates in Item 900 apply where it is necessary to perform a switching charge in connection with a connecting carrier road haul. These rates are so-called "reciprocal charges." Item 905 provides rates for switching movement between five specifically named districts when the movement is inter-terminal in nature as explained in Item No. 10 herein quoted.

As heretofore mentioned the Lakeside company is named In Item No. 380 as a specific industry located on Cut-Off lake. East Omaha. January to October, inclusive. 1924, the Union Pacific switched fifteen hundred and forty-one cars of ice for the Omaha Ice company; thirteen hundred and twenty of the cars Just mentioned were loaded direct from the water into cars, and were handled in January 1924. The applicant switched seven hundred sixty-four cars for the Lake - side company. AH of the cars last mentioned were loaded out of the storage house, and seven hundred thirty-three of the seven hundred sixty-four cars were consigned to South Omaha and are not involved n this case. Four were delivered to the Northwestern transfer and twenty-seven to the connection of the Burlington. The above figures are computed from Exhibit No. 1 as to the cars switched from the Omaha Ice company and as to the cars switched for the Lakeside company from testimony introduced by the applicant. According to the testimony, the eight hundred and three cars con - signed to the Burlington and the four hundred eighty-nine cars con - signed to the C. St. P. M. &amp; O. Railway company were for the individual use of the two companies just mentioned. The Omaha Ice company maintains an artificial ice plant In Omaha to which cars of ice are shipped from its Cut-Off lake ice houses. At present the switching charge is $6.30 per car. APPLICANT In support of the application, the applicant introduced testimony Intended to show that the cost of switching cars in the Omaha terminal The cars switched for the Omaha Ice company as heretofore nentioned, fifteen hundred and forty-one in all, were delivered as ollows: Total number Connecting track Loaded from of cars C.

            <seg id="p499">499 is $6.89 per ear. This cost was found by a study of the cars handled, and the cost of switching same by applicant in Omaha during the months of March and September, 1924; the cost was shown to be $7.65 per car in March and $6.33 in September. The two months averaged, equals $6.89. In the costs just stated, there is said to be no amount included to represent a return on the investment In track facilities and equipment other than the switch engines, and no charge is included for the per diem paid by the applicant to connecting lines for cars delivered to them for loading ice to be returned to the deliver - ing or road haul carrier. The amount found chargeable for the maintenance of the switch tracks In the applicant's Omaha yards was estimated, together with a number of other items that go to make up the total cost as shown by the witness for the applicant. L Witnesses for the applicant testified that all of the cars switched the Omaha districts are handled at less than cost; that the ap - •ant has expended more than $20,000 during the past year for the maintenance of the tracks serving the ice industries located on Cut-Off lake; that cars that are to be loaded to industries or for road haul ser - vice by connecting lines are furnished by said carriers; that during the ice harvest two switching crews are used to perform the switching service for the Cut-Off lake Ice industries; that one crew devotes all of its time to the switching of the cars at the ice houses and that one crew handles the empties and loads between the Summit yards and the Cut-Off lake tracks; that 100,000 capacity cars are furnished for ice loading where the loading is to Union Pacific industries or for road haul by the Union Pacific; that there are no industry tracks along the applicant's switching tracks north of Locust street except the Ice companies located on Cut-Off lake tracks; that the cars of ice handled from industries located on Cut-Off lake should not be considered as cars handled in reciprocal switching traffic; that the Union Pacific does not receive any traffic from connecting lines that would be re - ciprocal in nature to the cars of Ice delivered to connecting lines in Omaha; that reciprocal switching is illustrated by the following: "If the Burlington would bring a car into Omaha and it was consigned to an industry located on the Union Pacific we would switch that car to our industry at a nominal charge. On the other hand if the Union Pacific would bring in a car destined or con - signed to an industry located on the Burlington or any other connection in the switching limits of the Omaha yard they would set the car for us to their industry at the same nominal charge so that one car would off-set the other. If we switched 100 cars for the Burlington and they switched 100 cars for us the account would be balanced. We would simply be exchanging work with them"; that 95% of the cars handled through the Summit yards ot applicant are destined to or consigned from industries located on applicant's tracks in Omaha. </seg>
            <seg id="p500">500 INTERVENER8 The Lakeside company did not Introduce testimony because it was nformed that there was no intention by the applicant at this time to dvance the rate on carload shipments of ice from Cut-Off lake to outh Omaha and inasmuch as the bulk of its shipments went to outh Omaha it would not be affected by the rate applied for In the ppllcation in the degree that it would be if the new switch charge was to be assessed on all cars that moved from the ice house of the Lakeside company. The Omaha Ice company testified that if the rates were granted as asked for in the application the company would be put out of business; that the cost to said company for putting up water-ice for the year 1924 was 50.14c per ton; that said company received 55c per ton for all of the water-ice sold during the year 1924; that by water-ice is meant ice loaded into cars direct from the cutting pond; that the capacity of ice house number 1 is 13,000 tons; that the capacity of the so called "Red Ice House" is 8500 tons; that the company had ex - pended something more than $4600.00 in driving piling for the pre - servation and protection of the applicant's ice house tracks; that there was sold by the company during the ice season of 1924, 24,483.29 tons of water-ice to the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad com - pany, 13,691.61 tons to The Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha Railway company and to the Council Bluffs Coal &amp; Ice company, 7,- 90.25 tons; that the competition is very keen in the selling of water - ce to large users in Omaha and vicinity; that they load from twenty - ve to twenty-seven tons of ice in the ordinary car furnished; that 4 inch ice is loaded in the car in three tiers; that the expense of load - ng ice is materially increased if they attempt to put more than three lers of heavy ice in a car; that 10 and 12 inch ice usually loads four iers in a car; that there is located near and south of Locust street in istrict number four, other industries, such as the Standard Oil com - pany, Manhattan Oil ccrfiipany, and others, and that it comes in close K repetition with companies that cut ice at Memphis, Nebraska, and jux City, Iowa. We are not impressed with the testimony of the interveners that f this application is granted the water-ice cutting business on Cut-Off ake will be put out of business. We know of no reason why the car - ters should be required to switch cars of ice at less than cost in order hat the ice cutting industry may be profitable. If this application was granted the interveners would continue to have a material advantage over their competitors in so far as transportation charges are con - erned. </seg>

(c) The inter-terminal switching rates of the Omaha Ice com - pany when performed in connection with a connecting carrier line haul as follows: to $6.75 per car. These rates are reciprocal (d) Intra-terminal switching between the ice tracks and in - dustries located on the Union Pacific in Omaha from $6.30 per car to $6.75 per car. The only testimony introduced by the applicant relative to in - creasing the switching charge in Omaha to $6.75 per car was the cost accounting study introduced by witness Guild. This testimony is in - teresting and shows a careful study as to the cost of handling cars in switch service in the applicant's Omaha terminal, however, a number of the figures included in the cost study are estimated and the period covered by the study is for only two months. On cross-examination it was shown that the cost of operating switch engines in the Summit "break-up" yards was included in the cost study but some of the cars that were handled through that yard that did not originate or terminate in the Omaha yards were not included in the total number of cars used in finding the cost per car: to this extent the figures are not accurate. The cost shown in the study was an average of all the business handled in switch service in the Omaha yard for the period. Whether or not the cost of switching cars to and from the ice industries located on Cut-Off lake is above or below the general average of the Omaha terminal was not shown. &gt; ietween ice house tracks and Per Car. All points in the fourth district $ 2.25 And points in the first district 3.60 And points in the second district 4.05 And points in the third district 4.95 </seg>
            <seg id="p502">502 I We are very much interested in the study of terminal costs in con - :tion with switching carload and less than carload traffic. Generally taking, we are of tbe opinion that switching services should stand their own bottom, and not be a burden on road haul traffic, but in 8 case we do not believe that the cost study is of sufficient magnitude Justify us in making a general revision of the switching districts and irges of the applicant in Omaha. While it is true that the average igth of haul of this ice traffic is long, it is not shown that it is atlvely longer than other traffic which is handled at a less charge, e applicant proposes to continue a charge of }4.9S per car between lustries located between Nicholas and Locust streets and Summit, a tance fully as far if not farther than from the ice industry tracks to meeting line transfers located in the first district. For these isons we are of the opinion and so find that the $6.75 charge has not sn Justified. RECIPROCAL, SWITCHING The application asks our authority to increase the charge for cars of ice switched to connecting carriers for road haul service from $3.60 to J6.75. No testimony was introduced to show that the Union Pacific handles a greater number of cars in reciprocal switching ser - vice in Omaha than is handled for that company by other lines in the Omaha terminal. We are unable to find from this record any reason why carload shipments of ice originating at Cut-Off lake industries switched for road haul to connecting carriers, should be treated differ - ently than other cars handled in reciprocal switching in the Omaha terminal for like distances. It may be true, and probably is. that the applicant handles a greater number of carloads of ice in reciprocal switching service in Omaha than other carriers deliver to it, but other lines may handle a greater number of reciprocally switched cars of some other commodity delivered to the Union Pacific. It appears to us that any attempt to consider reciprocal switching by commodities is wrong in principle. We are of the opinion and so find that that part of the application here discussed should be denied. IXTERTERMIXAL. SWITCHING As to the inter-terminal switching rates the fact that a large number of the cars loaded in 1924 were delivered to connecting lines for the Individual use of the railroads does not, in our opinion, affect tbe amount of the charges as far as the Union Pacific is concerned. The service performed by the carriers in inter-terminal switching ser - vice is primarily a drayage service from one point in Omaha to another point In Omaha located on the tracks of a connecting line. Generally speaking, the switching rates in Omaha for all lines are adjusted on practically the same basis. The Burlington's charge for </seg>
            <seg id="p503">503 handling inter-terminal switching between close-in districts is $3.15 per car. For districts farther away the usual charge is $4.95 per car. This makes the joint charge tor the switching of a car from a close-in district to a similar district of a connecting carrier $6. SO per car. From the districts farther apart $4.95 is the charge for each carrier or a total through charge of $9.90. Cars of ice loaded directly from the water and handled in the winter months appear to be handled in a greater number of cars per train than the cars switched from storage during the summer months. According to the testimony the number of cars handled per train is approximately double in the winter months as compared with the summer. Ice is a low rated commodity, usually classed with sand, stone, clay etc., and unless some very un - usual circumstances surround the handling of the cars of ice her* under consideration — which has not been shown in this record — w« are unable to find a reason why we should authorize a higher charge for ice than other commodities handled in inter-terminal switching service. It so happens that during the past year the applicant has spent more than $20,000.00 in rehabilitating the Cut-Off lake tracks, this alone however, is not a sufficient reason why the switching rates of the industries served should be materially advanced. The record does not show that it costs the applicant more per car per annum to main - tain these ice loading tracks than it does to maintain other industry tracks in Omaha. From the record it appears that there was recently a general rebuilding of the ice tracks and accompanying loading chutes in the vicinity of the Omaha Ice company's tracks. In consideration of all of the facts in this record we are of the opinion and so find that the applicant has failed to justify the inter - terminal rates asked for, for switching cars of ice from industries located on their tracks north of Locust street in the fourth district. An order will be entered in accordance with these findings.

OPINION AND FINDINGS BY THE COMMISSION: As a result of complaints filed with the Commission, an order of investigation involving the local and joint rates on potatoes in carload r! from points on the Chicago &amp; North Western west of Norfolk points north and east of Norfolk on the Chicago &amp; North Western and the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha Railways was en - tered. Generally speaking, rates on potatoes from points on the Chicago North Western west of Norfolk, such as Gordon, to points on the orth Western north of Norfolk such as Verdigre are made by a ombination of the rate from Gordon to Norfolk and the rate from orfolk to destination. Rates from Gordon to points on the Chicago, t. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha Railway branches such as Hartington re made by using a combination on junction points such as Wake - eld. As a result of this method of rate making the rate on potatoes rom Gordon to Verdigre a distance of 332 miles in effect on the date '. the hearing of this case was 37c per cwt. as compared with a rate of Sc per cwt. applicable on the Union Pacific for a similar distance to branch line station and as compared with a rate of 26c applicable for milar distances to a branch line point on the Chicago, Burlington &amp; nincy Railroad. The defendant, Chicago &amp; North Western Railway ompany also maintains a rate of 26c per 100 pounds from Gordon </seg>
            <seg id="p505">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 505 to a considerable number of stations in the South Platte territory in - volving hauls ranging from 393 to 505 miles. The record clearly establishes the fact that the basis of rate mak - ing existing from points west of Norfolk to destinations on the so - called Winner line of the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway north of Norfolk and branch lines of the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis ft Omaha lying north of the main line of that railway to South Sioux City is inconsistent with the basis for rates on potatoes applying generally upon other railroads in Nebraska and upon the line of the defendant. Chicago &amp; North Western Railway company insofar as all destinations on lines south of the main line through Norfolk are con - cerned. In view of the fact that the Chicago St. Paul, Minneapolis ft Omaha and Chicago &amp; North Western Railway companies are closely related corporations who have been held to be in essence a single line or system for purposes of making rates in cases where the rates of those companies were involved before both the Interstate Commerce Commission and this Commission we shall deal with these lines as a single related system. In view of the facts of record in this proceeding we are of the opinion that the rates on potatoes in carload lots from stations on the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway west of Norfolk to destinations on the Winner branch of that railway and to destinations on branch lines of the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha Railway extending north from the main line between Norfolk and South Sioux City are unjust and unreasonable and unjustly discriminatory. We are of the opinion and so find that just, reasonable and non-discriminatory rates for the future from Nebraska stations west of Norfolk to points on the Winner branch north of Norfolk and the branches of the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha north of the main line from Norfolk to South Sioux City shall not exceed the rates from point of origin to South Sioux City by more than two cents per hundred pounds.

OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Chairman This proceeding, involving all livestock rates from points of origin in this state to the markets at Omaha and Nebraska City, and their relation to rates on livestock from the same points of pro - duction to Sioux City, St. Joseph and Kansas City; was instituted by the Commission under circumstances which are fully stated below. By complaint filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission early in 1917, the South St. Joseph Live Stock Exchange alleged that rates applicable on livestock in carloads from Nebraska stations on the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad (hereinafter called the "Burlington"), to St. Joseph, Missouri, were unjust and unreasonable and unduly discriminatory by comparison with the live stock rates from the same points of origin to Omaha. An intervening petition filed by the Kansas City Live Stock Exchange raised the same issues with respect to live stock rates from points In this state to Kansas City. The decision of the Interstate Commerce Commission in this South St. Joseph Livestock Exchange case, 53 I. C. C. 114, rendered April 26, 1919, held that livestock rates from stations on the Burling - ton north and west of Aurora, including the Ericson and Sargent branches, to St. Joseph and Kansas City, were not unreasonable; but that the maintenance of relatively lower rates from the area described, to Omaha, produced unjust discrimination against St. Joseph and Kansas City, which the defendant, Burlington railroad, was required to remove by establishing rates to St. Joseph and Kansas City on cattle and sheep, double deck, nol more than five cents, and on hogs and sheep single deck, not more than six cents per hundred pounds higher than the rates maintained from the same point of origin to Omaha. The Burlington could have complied with this order by reducing its </seg>
            <seg id="p508">508 vestock rates to St. Joseph and Kansas City, but in view of the finding ' the Interstate Commerce Commission that rates to those markets ere not unreasonable; it complied with the order by Increasing its ates to Omaha, which was done October 15, 1919. Since the territory orth and west of Aurora, including the Burwell and Sargent branches, served by the Union Pacific and Chicago &amp; North Western Railroads. hose livestock rates were undisturbed by the order of the interstate Commerce Commission in the South St. Joseph case, supra; livestock Uppers normally served by the Burlington found that after October 5, 1919, livestock rates from their Burington shipping points were niformly higher than the rates from nearby stations on the Union 'aciflc and North Western to Omaha, and that the rates to St. Joseph nd Kansas City remained upon the same level on these competing nes. The increases in livestock rates to Omaha generally amounted o five cents per cwt. on cattle and six cents per cwt. on hogs and heep, when made in October, 1919, but these amounts have been urther increased 25 per cent under the order of the Nebraska State ailway Commission dated August 7. 1920. (13 N. S. R. C. 443-456) and 10 per cent additional by the order of the Interstate Comincrrp Commission in I. C. C. Docket 11S29. 60 I. C. C. 305. effective March 10, 1921. and modified by a temporary voluntary reduction of It per cent effective January 1, 1922. which was made permanent by our order in Application No 4*3s. (15 N. S. R. C. 401- Shippers and communities in the affected territory complained of ligher rates from Burlington stations to Omaha than were simultan - ously in effect from Union Pacific or Chicago &amp; North Western tations. These complaints were filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission directly, or in connection with complaints of the Omaha jive Stock exchange. Similar complaints were filed here, although we had no power to correct the situation until the order of the Infer - tate Commerce Commission in the South St. Joseph case, supr .: pired October 15, 1921, and the order of the same tribunal in I. C. C. Docket 11829 was modified on May 24, 1922. t Responsive to the complaints referred to, the Interstate Commerce imission instituted an investigation on November 7, 1921, designated I. C. C. Docket 13273, Inquiring: "into the matter of the relationship between the interstate and intrastate rates on ordinary livestock, in carloads, from all Ne - braska points to Omaha and South Omaha, Nebraska, and the interstate rates from the same points of origin to Kansas City and St. Joseph, Mo., and Sioux City, Iowa, with a view to prescribing such rates from and to the said points of origin and destination as will remove any undue prejudice to, or undue preference of, Kan - sas City and St. Joseph, Mo., Omaha and South Omaha, Nebraska, or Sioux City, Iowa, and receivers of livestock located thereat and any unjust discrimination against interstate commerce." </seg>
            <seg id="p509">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 509 This investigation was set down for bearing at Omaha May 18, 1922, at which time a member of this Commission sat with the examiner who took the testimony for the Interstate Commerce Com - mission. A large volume of testimony was taken, briefs were sub - mitted and the examiner in charge made a tentative report indicating tin' view that livestock rates from Nebraska points to Omaha and South Omaha are depressed by reason of the fifteen per cent reduction required by the act of the Nebraska Legislature of 1907, commonly known as the Aldrich Act (Sec. 6064-R. C. 1913); and that unjust discriminations against interstate commerce and markets at Sioux City, Kansas City, and St. Joseph probably exist. Since the examiner's report in I. C. C. Docket 13273 raised serious questions as to the law - fulness of livestock rates from Nebraska stations to Omaha and South Omaha — whether such rates be measured by the requirements of either the Interstate Commerce Act or the laws of this state gover - ning our jurisdiction — we expressed a desire to aid the Interstate Com - merce Commission in its efforts to find a proper remedy for the con - ditions complained of; and this proceeding was instituted to determine whether the Nebraska live stock rates to Omaha, are unlawful, and If unlawful what action should be taken by us to correct the situation. The record in I. C. C. Docket 13273, was introduced as an ex - hibit in this case. Hearings were had in this proceeding at Lincoln October 23, 1922, when much supplementary testimony and some ad - ditional exhibits tending to throw further light on this controversy, were submitted. THE POSITION OF THE PARTIES The carriers contended that all intrastate rates on livestock, applicable between points in Nebraska, are too low and should be in - creased. They alleged that reductions in livestock rates following the passage of the Aldrich Act of 1907 unduly depressed the entire level of intrastate rates on that commodity, and that, by reason of the absence of similar reductions in interstate rates, an undue pre - ference was given to Omaha and other Nebraska live stock markets, while the markets at St. Joseph and Kansas City suffered a resulting undue and unlawful prejudice. They contended that if the reductions flowing from the Aldrich Act had not been required, their revenues from Nebraska livestock traffic would have been $805,681 higher in the fiscal year ending December 31, 1921, and that this reduction in revenue created an unlawful discrimination against interstate com - merce as a whole, which should be removed without reference to the relationship of livestock rates from points in this state to state and interstate markets. They state that the additional revenue they demand can be secured, and a proper relation of state and interstate rates es - tablished, by permitting them to make effective rates, (a) Increase all Nebraska livestock rates to South Omaha, Nebraska City, and </seg>
            <seg id="p510">510 ijux City, about 20 per cent, to the level which would now exist if luctlons had not been required by the Aldrich Act of 1907 — leaving tea to St. Joseph and Kansas City unchanged, and maintaining the Istlng equalization between Sioux City and Omalyi from stations on e Chicago &amp; North Western, Norfolk and west thereof; or (b) es - blish Increased livestock rates from all Nebraska stations to South naha, Nebraska City and Sioux City, based upon rates twenty per at higher than the existing Central Freight Association scale, meeting ort-line competition and preserving the equalization of Omaha and dux City at stations west of Norfolk. Representatives of the markets at Sioux City, South Omaha, South t Joseph and Kansas City, submitted a large amount of oral testi - ny and comprehensive exhibits reviewing all phases of the questions at issue. Representatives of shippers and communities served by the Bur - lington submitted testimony showing the discrimination flowing from the increases in rates from those points to Omaha, and contended that the existing charges should be reduced to the basis now applying from competing Union Pacific and Chicago &amp; North Western points of origin to the Omaha market. The State of Nebraska assisted in this investigation by its at - torney general and rate expert, who submitted testimony and exhibits which exhaustively analyzed all phases of the livestock industry of Nebraska, as related to the transportation of that commodity, the general and special transportation conditions involved and the rates applicable in this and adjacent states upon both state and interstate commerce. All parties of record, excepting the respondent carriers, were united on the single proposition that no higher level of livestock rates than that which now exists can be justified for application to either state or interstate traffic from Nebraska stations to Sioux City, Iowa, South Omaha and Nebraska City, Nebraska, and South St. Joseph and Kansas City, Missouri. The position of the South St. Joseph and Kansas City Live Stock exchanges was that the relation of livestock rates from Burlington tations north and west of Aurora to Omaha and St. Joseph — Kansas City, fixed by the order of the Interstate Commerce Commission in the South St. Joseph case, 53 I. C. C. 114, is just and proper and should &gt;e continued in effect. It was their view, however, that livestock rates from this territory served by the Burlington, are unjust and un - reasonable and should be reduced. They said that if these rates to Kansas City and St. Joseph be put upon a reasonable basis, and the carrier be required to maintain rates on livestock to Omaha in the </seg>
            <seg id="p511">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 511 same relation to rates to Kansas City — St. Joseph as now exists, the so related rates to Omaha will be on a basis consistent with the rates In effect from points on other lines in the same territory to that market. The Omaha Live Stock exchange took the position that, with cer - tain exreptions, rates on livestock from Nebraska points to all markets are on a basis free from unlawful discrimination, and that the rates In effect are adequate and not unduly low. They contended that rate* from Burlington stations north and west of Aurora are unjust and un - reasonable and should be reduced, and that they have no objection to the continuance of the relation between Omaha and the St. Joseph — Kansas City markets, established by the Interstate Commerce Com - mission, if rates to all these markets be put upon a Just and reason - able basis. They assert that the consuming markets for meat pro - ducts are located largely at points east of Chicago and that any read - justment of Nebraska livestock rates to Omaha — St. Joseph and Kan - sas City, resulting in increases to those points, with no change In rates to Chicago, will produce undue preferences of the Chicago market and undue prejudices to the detriment of the Missouri River markets. They allege that existing transportation conditions Justify the continued grouping of Sioux City and Omaha upon the same rate base, for move - ments from points on the Chicago &amp; North Western, Norfolk and west. The Omaha interests do not favor a distance scale of rates for ap - plication in Nebraska. They urge that the scope of both the state and Interstate Investigation is too narrow to permit any general readjust - ment of Nebraska livestock rates, and that if a readjustment Is at - tempted, It will inevitably produce new and more serious discrimina - tions than can possibly be found to exist In the rate structure here under discussion. The Sioux City Live Stock exchange complained of the adjustment from northeastern and northern Nebraska to Omaha, as compared with Sioux City. Its position was that the livestock rates from these sections of the state unduly favor Omaha, to the undue prejudice of the Sioux City market. Representatives of this market expressed the conviction that rates now in effect from these Nebraska points to Sioux City are excessive and unreasonable and that rates to Omaha are adequate and not unduly low but they suggested the application of a distance scale of rates which would give recognition to the fact that Sioux City is approximately 40 miles closer to points on the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway west of Norfolk, Nebraska, than the South Omaha market. They contend that transportation condi - tions from points on the railway to Sioux City and Omaha are sub - stantially similar, and that the shorter distance to Sioux City should be reflected in a livestock rate as much lower than that to Omaha from the same point or origin, as would be produced by the application of a reasonable distance scale. </seg>
            <seg id="p512">512 The state of Nebraska took the position that, generally speaking, Nebraska rates both intrastate and interstate are not unreasonably ft, either per se or as compared with the rates in effect in adjoining tes, upon state and interstate traffic. The traffic conditions in ad - nlng states are substantially similar to those existing in Nebraska, indeed they are as favorable as those obtaining in this state. It contended, however, that the rates now in effect from points of origin on the Burlington railroad north and west of Aurora to the St. Joseph and Kansas City markets and to Omaha, are unjust and un - reasonable and should be reduced. It further contends that if just and reasonable rates be established from this territory to the lower river markets, and rates to Omaha are fixed upon a basis consistent with the differentials established between Omaha and the lower river mar - kets in the South St. Joseph case, supra, the resulting reduced rates to Omaha would be substantially in harmony with the rates in effect from competing points on the Union Pacific and North Western railroads to the same markets. The scope of our investigation in this cause was indicated in le order instituting the proceedings, wherein it was stated "that the ebraska State Railway Commission enter upon an investigation of ntrastate rates on ordinary livestock in carloads in Nebraska in their elation to each other and to rates to interstate markets and distances rom the same points of origin to the end that undue discrimination, nreasonable preference, and inequalities may be corrected so far as tracticable upon the record there made." Much testimony presented by the carriers had to do with reason - ableness of livestock rates per se. This investigation was not so broad. It is our understanding that the scope of the investigation, Instituted by the Interstate Commerce Commission in its Docket 13273, was likewise limited to the elimination or preferential and discrimina - tory conditions in the livestock rate fabric to Missouri river markets. From the record we are not persuaded that the alleged discrimina - ory conditions, measured as they have been largely by distance of laul, have played an important part in bending the movement of Ivestock to or from a particular market. That it did so was the al - egation in the original complaint in St. Joseph Live Stock Exchange . Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Co., 53 I. C. C. 114. The djustments there made were upon the conclusion that the natural ow of interstate traffic was interrupted. In 1917, under rate conditions complained of, 88.9 per cent of the cattle from the territory affected by the order in the St. Joseph Live Stock Exchange case, supra, and 88.22 per cent of the hogs went tthe Omaha market. In 1920, under the adjusted rate fabric, 89 cent of the cattle and 83.6 per cent of the hogs went to Omaha. </seg>
            <seg id="p513">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 513 Between the two years Omaha gained one tenth of one per cent In cattle and lost 4.62 per cent in volume ol hogs. Kansas City lost 3.12 per cent in cattle and gained 4.75 per cent in hogs. St. Joseph gained 3.2 per cent in cattle and lost thirteen hundredths per cent in hogs. Originally much of the South Platte territory was par to Omaha and the lower markets, with the distance favoring Omaha. The legislative rate reduction In 1907 favored Omaha. Livestock from the Burlington line along the southern border of the state continues to flow practically exclusively to the lower markets. Omaha secures large quantities of livestock under rates somewhat adverse to it from points in northeast Nebraska. Rates have been the same from North Western points north and west of Norfolk to both Sioux City and Omaha, but the movement of livestock has been almost exclusively to Omaha. Possible Solutions The record presents four major possibilities of adjusting live - stock rates from Nebraska points of origin to Missouri river markets, which may be stated as follows: ( ,i i Adjust downward the advances made in St. Joseph Live siiM-k case, supra, and retain the proper relationship between the lower river markets and Omaha by an adjustment also .of the interstate rates from points on the Burlington north of Aurora to lower river markets. (b) Raise all livestock rates in Nebraska sufficiently to over - come effects of the reduction made by the 1907 legislative act and ad - just the territory of the Burlington north and west of Aurora down - ward in keeping with that general readjustment. (c) Apply generally from Nebraska to the Missouri river mar - kets, state and interstate, a distance scale as a maximum on some proper level. (d) From the territory in cross-country competition with stations on the Burlington north and west of Aurora, adjust upward rates of other carriers to Omaha "commensurate with the existing Burlington rates in that territory; providing, interstate, that Sioux City shall have a larger recognition of its nearby territory than is given by the existing schedules, bearing in mind that Sioux City is located in higher rated territory, generally speaking, from all points of origin to the westward; leave all other territory not complained against by anyone in these proceedings with the scale now existing. V </seg>
            <seg id="p514">514 SEVENTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT k(a) This would be merely undoing what many believe to have ■n wrong conclusions in the St. Joseph Live Stock Exchange case. It uld reduce revenues of the Burlington and increase those of no other road. It would not correct the alleged discriminations in the Sioux City territory, nor would it place hogs, cattle and sheep upon the proper relationship to each other. It would require the cancellation by the Interstate Commerce Commission of its finding in the South St. Joseph Live Stock case, which that body is unwilling to do. (b) The proposal of the carriers merely to raise the rates by removing the effects of the statutory enactment of sixteen years ago eaves the relationship between the Missouri river markets more out of alignment than they now are. The position of the carriers is that what grew up under competitive conditions over a long period of time can be assumed to be a reasonable adjustment between the various markets. The preferential situations which would result will be pointed out hereafter. At the hearing before the Nebraska Commission, subsequent to he hearing before the examiner of the Interstate Commerce Commls - ion, an additional proposal of solution was developed by the carriers, rii.: a distance scale twenty per cent in excess of the present Central Freight Association scale. If applied intrastate it would disrupt the relationships between the markets disastrously to the omaha market. If approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission for interstate ap - plication it would put livestock traffic from Nebraska points of origin except as affected by short-line competition to Kansas City and St. Joseph very nearly fifty per cent higher than present rates to those markets from Kansas points of origin; about that much higher than he existing rates from Iowa to Sioux City, Omaha and the lower markets; forty-four per cent higher than rates from North Missouri o St. Louis; at least that much higher than rates from Missouri points north of the Missouri river to Kansas City and St. Joseph: and almost wenty per cent higher than the scale proposed by the examiner to rux City from South Dakota points east of the Missouri river in :ket No. 12268, under traffic conditions shown of record in this case be more adverse than any in Nebraska. (d) This suggested solution would only he justified if existing state rates in Nebraska are too low compared with existing rates to interstate points from Nebraska and compared generally with rates, ■tate and interstate, in the great livestock producing territory in the middle west, of which Nebraska is a part. kdi The application of a distance scale on livestock rates from ibraska, if applied, should be with due regard to the rate levels in rrounding states.

It would eliminate relatively wide blankets that came into b«i»I under conditions perhaps quite dissimilar to what they are today. It would destroy the advantage which the earlier wer river markets had in the parity of rates over considerable advantage not entirely removed by the legislative percentage tion. It would remove whatever advantage came to Omaha application in much of northern and northeast Nebraska of .in to Omaha and Sioux City. ems presented in this case, taken in conjunction with ited in the interstate investigation, have been so complex rather reluctant conclusion upon this Commission that of distance scales is the remedy which must be used. l.vHopiiiK such I stale proper consideration must be given to ml traffic conditions as they relate to livestock in the state iraska compared with other territories where distance scales een made effective after much study and the livestock rate states roundabout Nebraska with which rate levels ticahle. the rates resulting from a distance scale, should ■nil traffic density in Nebraska compares favorably, per mile with that of states roundabout.

This heavy production of feed stuffs is the basis for movement of stock cattle and sheep from ranges or feeder markets to Nebraska farms. There is a larger return use of stock cars between market and production point than would be the case were not feeding operations so heavy. In 1921 Nebraska received 433.000 head of stockers and feeder cattle and calves, of which one-half were loaded from Omaha, to which market the major part of Nebraska livestock is consigned. In the same year Kansas received 348.000 head from Kansas City, Its principal market for fat livestock. Iowa received the major portion of its feeders from Omaha and from markets in the trend of the flow of the finished livestock. Only about five per cent of Iowa feeders shipped in come from Chicago, Iowa's chief fat livestock market.

Railway company, show - ing the livestock originating or received in 1921 at stations served by that line in the states in which its mileage lies, generally confirms the relative situation shown by the U. S. Department of Agriculture survey figures. These 1921 loadings on the C. &amp; N. W. appear below. These (acts are of value in measuring the general level of a scale of rates from Nebraska points of origin to Missouri river markets with established scales and existing rates in Kansas, Missouri, Iowa and South Dakota. They have led to the joint consideration of the problem by the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Nebraska State Rail - way Commission and to conclusions arrived at in harmony.

On interstate movement from Nebraska points of origin no adjustments have yet been made except by the carriers themselves. In certain portions of the territory served by the North Western the statutory changes in rates to the Omaha market are reflected in voluntary changes on traffic to Sioux City. Speaking in geological terminology, the rate structure In Neb- raska shows a plane covering much of the state of Kansas, and extending into southern Nebraska for some distance. In the states north and west of Nebraska exist livestock rate plateaus. The Ne - braska rate scheme is a plane tilted up toward the north and west and lying generally east and west. There are localized valleys and ridges within the plane. The record contains many comparisons of average rates to Missouri river markets from Nebraska, with scales prescribed in well considered cases by the Interstate Commerce Commission covering considerable territories.

Average rates to a market may be no more than compared with average rates to that market, or for like distances. Average rates on any line of railroad to any market from blocks measured by distance will be affected by the extent of short-line competitive influence. Average rates to Omaha on the Burlington and Rock Island are slightly lower rom equivalent blocks than those of the other carriers. Much of the Surlington territory is in the South Platte where the level is influenced &gt;y the rate situation to the south. The Hock Island serves the same territory. The Missouri Pacific rates are slightly higher.

LIVESTOCK RATES IN SOUTHERN NEBRASKA The rates along the southern border of Nebraska, both state and interstate, are lower than any other rates in the state, except from certain northeast Nebraska points to Omaha. Mr. Childe, for the Omaha Chamber of Commerce, explained this in much the same man - ner that the relative grain rates in this territory are explained by the carriers, viz.: The rates originally published were by zones running north and south and inasmuch as the Missouri river extends north - west and southeast the rates in the southern portion of the zone are for longer hauls to the market than in the northern portion of the zone. The logic of such a scheme is less apparent than the explana - tion. In Dimmitt-Caudle-Smith v. C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co., 47 I. C. C. 287, the Interstate Commerce Commission laid down a scale of rates for application to St. Louis and East St. Louis from the northern portion of Missouri. The rates to Kansas City from Western Missouri and the rates from Kansas to Kansas City and St. Joseph, while not similiarly arranged, do not, on the whole, exceed the level established in the North Missouri case.

C. &amp; N. W. Ry. Co., et al., 7 I. C. C. 451. Tabulations will be presented in this finding illustrat- K the two rates scales, with their relation to the existing rates, both terstate and intrastate, to Missouri river markets. IN ION PACIFIC KATES TO MISSOURI RIVER MARKETS I The record does not indicate that Sioux City complains in any way to discrimination from Union Pacific points because it does not get traffic from those lines. The lower river markets of St. Joseph and Kansas City get a steady and noticeable movement, particularly from points west ot Urand Island, the movement usually being by way of the St. Joseph and Grand Island, a subsidiary with direct route to the lower markets. There is also some movement of livestock to the lower markets on the line extending north from Manhattan to Central City and Valley. Table No. 3 shows the cattle rates to the lower markets based on average mileage between Kansas City and St. Joseph, the points of origin being spread at intervals over the length of the line north from the Kansas border and on the main line west from Omaha. For reference the C. F. A. scale, the North Missouri scale and the South Dakota scale for equal mileages are added. Ignoring the volume of traffic and measuring merely the level of the rate in this table, it is seen that the North Missouri scale is about four per cent lower than the existing rate. Central Freight Association rates about twelve per cent higher, and the South Dakota scale 16 per cent higher. Respond - ents' proposal for a distance scale to be applied Intrastate would, if applied on the Union Pacific to the lower markets, increase the existing rates about thirty-five per cent. Table No. 4 shows the freight rates to Omaha from specified points of origin and compares those rates with various other scales, including the two proposals of the carriers for adjusting intrastate rates in Nebraska. It will be observed that the North Missouri scale Is higher both state and interstate from these points for the shorter distances and lower for the longer distances. A computation indicates that if the rate were applied to the actual volume of traffic it would have the effect of increasing the revenue results from applying the North Miss - ouri scale to Omaha, and if applied to the traffic from points named In </seg>
            <seg id="p522">522 Table No. 3 would reduce the revenue effect. This is because the dis - tances used in Table No. 3 average 320 miles; in Table No. 4, 230 miles. The lower market of the Union Pacific is affected in its rate scales by short-line competition with the Burlington but the difference in distances is not enough at any one point to change the rate materially.

            <seg id="p524">524 I Omaha rates were based on the Kansas City rates as a result of finding in the St. Joseph case, the rates on the branches were de considerably higher than on the main line. This was probably i to the fact that originally the rates on the branches were made h regard to where the traffic moved and were not adjusted to the er markets because the traffic did not go there. This is illustrated reference to the destination of livestock traffic in 1921 on the main s and from the branches of the Burlington. This relation of state [ interstate destination in 1921 does not differ appreciably from relation in 1917 from the same points. Percentage Relation of State and Interstate Destinations 1921 Livestock Shipments. Main Line Branch Line State Interstate State Interstate Conclusions as to Rates In Central and Southern Nebraska. I The application of a distance scale will remedy the inequalities it have been pointed out in southern and central Nebraska. These qualities have been the result of market development and desire the part of carriers to proffer favorable rates on the traffic to the rket which at the time the rates were applied served the territory, lume told the story. There has since been practically no shifting territory monopolized, or almost monopolized, by the different mar - &amp;. Adjustments of rates by government authority, state and inter - te, have disturbed the rate schemes put in by the carriers but not I trend of traffic. IFor example, the present rate scheme from the Republican Valley more favorable to Omaha than it was prior to 1907 under carrier - ,de rates. The livestock in the Republican Valley nevertheless goes the lower markets almost exclusively. From territory further north the Burlington, limited on its northern border by the Omaha-Denver .in line, the loading somewhat prefers lower river markets, although has been pointed out the differential due to distance is now approxi - tely correct. The general theory on which rates structures have been built is that the Missouri river is a rate-breaking point and the territory to the west of it should, under all the circumstances, take higher rates than east of it. Volume of traffic and operating conditions may warrant that general conclusion with respect to westbound traffic. Eastbound traffic is handled under entirely different conditions.

These facts should be taken into account in applying any general principle of rate level to the territory under question. North Nebraska Rates North Nebraska territory is served largely by the North Western and the Omaha roads. The general traffic density is lighter than on the other roads because of Its lack of through traffic over those two roads in Nebraska. The volume of livestock movement Is higher. This territory lies close to the higher rated livestock territory on the north, which fact has been reflected In higher state and interstate rates than in territory south. The rates to Sioux City from west of the Missouri river always reflected, In a measure, the fact that It la located at the edge of what has generally been called higher rated livestock territory. Omaha interests contend that the rates from Omaha into north - eastern Nebraska were in existence before Sioux City became a market and have remained the same except for the statutory reductions of 1907. They say that when Sioux City became a market it was only natural that it should be considered on par relation with Omaha and that such relationship is just as logical as it is in the making of the rate fabric to St. Joseph and Kansas City. They urge also that Sioux City should take higher rates, mile for mile, than Omaha because of the expensive bridge construction across the Missouri river. It is difficult to justify the relation of rates to Omaha and Sioux City from part of the territory in the northeastern part of the state. This difficulty is not so apparent on the line of the Burlington, Ash - land to Sioux City, or on the line of the M. &amp; O. from Omaha to Sioux City, particularly when we bear in mind that in making its rates to Omaha the Burlington was the long line and was competing with the M. &amp; O., the Burlington's distance being 142 miles and that of the Omaha road 124 miles. It should also be borne in mind that the rates of the Omaha road, or M. &amp; O., are made with full allowance for the fact that this road does not reach the Omaha market and an additional charge of $2.70 per car is paid by the shipper on move - ments to Omaha, which is not true when the movement is to Sioux On the Norfolk-Sioux City line of the Omaha road the rates are higher to Sioux City from Winside, Hoskins and Norfolk than to Omaha, although the distance is only one-half as great. No proper relationship between Omaha and Sioux City exists in present rates from points Wayne and east thereof on this road when measured by respective mileages. The differences range from one to four cents. </seg>
            <seg id="p526">526 The same Is true of the branch lines of the Omaha road north of the Norfolk-Sioux City line. Measured by mileage the differential should favor Sioux City by 5 to 6 cents per hundred weight on rattle, whereas they now range from 2 hi cents, favorable to Sioux City, to rates from some points lower to Omaha than to Sioux City. On the Winner branch of the North Western rates quoted from 'lainview north to the state line are the same, both to Sioux City and o Omaha. The distance in favor of Sioux City by way of Norfolk is 5 miles. The same is true on the main line of the North Western west of Norfolk. Sioux City is 4 5 miles nearer points of origin than •• Omaha. It seems apparent that under the actual transportation conditions listing discrimination exists against Sioux City by reason of the resent schedules of rates. These discriminations, for the most part, xisted before the rate reduction legislation of 1907. It is difficult to ell what is the actual effect on the trend of traffic. The record shows onclusively that Sioux City does not compete successfully under equal onditions with Omaha. The cattle rate from Pender to Sioux City s 14 cents and to Omaha 15 cents. The distance to Omaha is SI miles and to Sioux City 41 miles. In 1921 only one per cent of the vestock went to Sioux City. Emerson is 30 miles from Sioux City ;m&lt;l 4 miles from Omaha. Sioux City has an advantage of twenty per ent over Omaha in the cattle rate. Only 63 per cent of the livestock n 1921 went to Sioux City. From Omaha road points on the Sioux ity-Norfolk line and from points on its branches north thereof the dvantage in rates is from nothing to 2% cents on cattle in favor of ioux City. There Is a distinct advantage in favor of Sioux City in ime in transit in shipments. In spite of these handicaps Omaha secures a substantial percentage of the business. On the Burlington ine from Ashland to Sioux City, Walthill is 27 miles from Sioux City nd 112 miles from Omaha. The advantage in rate in favor of Sioux City on cattle is 25 per cent, yet two thirds of the livestock from Walt - ill went to Omaha in 1921. The traffic year of 1921 is not out of ne with other years. Sioux City got no livestock from Rosalie In 921, although the rate to the interstate point was lower and the istance only one-third of that to Omaha. On the Winner branch of the North Western the rates are the same to both markets from points north of Plainview. The time of elivery at Sioux City is three hours shorter than at Omaha. In 1921 o livestock moved from Nebraska points on that line to Sioux City. With rates the same to both markets from points.west of Norfolk and ime of delivery to Sioux City three hours shorter than to Omaha nly two to twenty per cent of the total shipments were marketed at ioux City and all other interstate markets combined. </seg>
            <seg id="p527">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 527 Relationship of rates to Sioux City and Omaha markets from this part of Nebraska presents a complexity not existing in other parts of the state. No scale of rates based on distance can be collected by any railroad if short-line competition is to be considered. The Bur- lington is the short-line from many points to Sioux City and the long line to Omaha. The North Western would like to continue parity of rates to both markets from points north and west of Norfolk. Efforts to iron out the market discriminations by localizing the adjustments have not prospered. The rate situation in northeastern Nebraska is illustrated In Tables Nos. 6. T, and 8 below.

Obviously, uch rates must have proper relationship to the rates from South )akota to Omaha and Sioux City existing from South Dakota, through ■ebraska to Omaha and Sioux City; and also proper relationship to he rates to the south of Nebraska in Kansas and Missouri.

Docket 13273. and the tate case, Resolution No. 74, was heard jointly by the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Nebraska Commission. At that time igorous objection was made by the carriers to scales that had been roposed because such scales flattened out too rapidly in the western art of the state.

            <seg id="p529">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 529 Chicago market on the one hand and Missouri river markets on the other. This contention seemed so well founded that the scales here - after set forth have been amended to eliminate the objection and to blend the Nebraska rates as near as could be Into the Wyoming and South Dakota rates. Such adjustment has the effect of increasing the spread between Omaha and the lower markets for the longer distances and because there is parity of rates from Wyoming to Omaha and the lower markets it will be presently impossible for the carriers to collect the full scale from certain western Nebraska points to the lower markets. This disability does not exist on shipments to Omaha. Two scales are provided herein differing somewhat in level be - cause northern Nebraska is in higher rated territory, generally speak - ing, than southern Nebraska, and in order to blend properly with the rates in adjoining states. From points on the North Western's line, extending from Scribner via Dakota Junction into Wyoming and South Dakota and from other points in Nebraska north of Albion, Humphrey, Scribner and Oak - land for single line application on cattle and on calves, hogs and sheep in double deck cars rates based on scale 1 in the appendix sheet attached should be applied and from other points in Nebraska for single line application on the above kinds of traffic rates based on scale 2 of the appendix sheet; on hogs and calves in single deck can and on horses and mules the rate should be 115 per cent of the rates on cattle for like hauls; and on sheep in single deck cars 125 per cent thereof. In arriving at rates under these percentages fractions may be disposed of as follows: fractions of less than one- fourth of a cent to be omitted; fractions of one-fourth of a cent or greater, but less than three-fourths of a cent, to be stated as one-half cent; frac - tions of three-fourths of a cent and greater to be increased to the next whole cent. It is deemed advisable that joint rates be published. We find that for moving cattle and for moving calves and hogs and sheep in double deck cars over two or more lines for distances of five hundred miles and less, a differential of not to exceed 3 V4 cents may be added to the single line rates herein set forth. For moving hogs and calves In single deck cars and horses and mules over two or more lines a differential of 4 cents may be added to the single line rates. For transporting sheep in single deck cars a differential of 4.5 cents may be added. In determining distances for the application of the foregoing rates, they shall be computed via the shortest routes, but need not involve more than the lines or parts of lines of three carriers. Carriers operating under a common control or management, as the Chicago &amp; North Western, and the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha, </seg>

It is expected that the carriers will publish specific rates from the respective points of origin to final destination and not merely a distance scale. The scales here set forth are not intended for such rigid application as would prevent meeting short line, or reasonable cross-county, competition. No order will be entered at this time for reasons heretofore set forth. These findings are sufficient warrant for the carriers to publish out on statutory notice rates in accordance with the scale attached hereto in appendix. It is expected that the rates will be published to be effective on or before July 20, 1924. If such publication is not made the Commission will reopen the case for such proceedings as are appropriate. Made and entered at Lincoln, Nebraska, this third day of May. 1924.

BROWNE, Chairman Our findings in this case were entered of record May 3, 1924, nd in all essential respects coincided with conclusions of the Inter - tate Commerce Commission in re I. C. C. Docket No. 13273. Under date of June 24, 1924, the Omaha Chamber of Commerce and the Omaha Live Stock Exchange filed petition for modification of the Commission's report to the extent that the Chicago and North Western Railway company and the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis and Omaha Railway company "may be permitted to publish rates on livestock from points in Nebraska on the Chicago and North Western Railway west and northwest of Norfolk to Sioux City and Omaha Btockyards, based on average distances to the two markets so that the same or common rates may apply to both markets from any station in the territory above described." The petition indicates a common understanding between peti - tioners and the named carriers as to modification of the indicated rates, if the conclusions of this Commission and of the Interstate Commerce Commission would permit. Nothing else of record indicates such common intention. From the very nature of the motion, it would be necessary for the adjustment to be made coordinately by the Interstate Commerce Commission and this Commission, inasmuch as interstate rates would necessarily be adjusted. Under date of July 7, 1924, the Interstate Commerce Commission denied the petition. This Commission must, therefore, by reason of the nature of the prayer, take similar action. </seg>

(SEAL) RESOLUTION XO. 85 In the Matter of the Reconsideration of an Order Authorizing the Missouri Pacific Railroad Corporation in Nebraska to Publish a Certain Item in Its Switching Tariff Relative to the Use of its Team Tracks. TAYLOR, Commissioner This proceeding arises on an order of the Commission directing the Missouri Pacific Railroad Corporation in Nebraska to show cause why an order issued on May 2, 1923, should not be revoked or modified Tuat order approved an application by the Missouri Pacific for author - ity to publish a new and additional item in its freight tariff. Nebraska No. 7, said item reading as follows: "Team tracks of the Missouri Pacific Railroad Corporation in Nebraska are for its sole use and switching service from or to such tracks will not be performed for connecting railroads." Subsequent to the effective date of the order of approval com - plaint was lodged with the Commission by Trenmor Cone on behalf of the Consumers Sand company, alleging that change In the rule and practice of the Missouri Pacific prevented his company from placing carload shipments of sand on team tracks conveniently accessible to certain paving jobs then in progress. The order to show cause was entered by the Commission on September 27, 1923, and hearing was had on October 23, 1923. </seg>
            <seg id="p533">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 533 The general rule as to the use of team tracks is that they are reserved by the owning carrier for shipments originating on its own line, and that their use is denied to shipments originating on com - peting lines. To this extent they are treated very much the same as freight depots and warehouses established and maintained by a carrier for the use of less than carload shippers. Their use for the shipments received from other lines is either positively denied or rates for such service are made so high as to be prohibitive. The record in this case discloses that the rules and the practice of the Missouri Pacific at Omaha have been directly contrary to the general policy above outlined and that this condition has existed for a period of at least forty years. Carload shipments received from other lines have been accepted by the Missouri Pacific and switched to its team tracks for unloading just as it placed cars to its own In - dustries. The ordinary switching charge applicable for the move - ment from the point of connection with the receiving line to the point of placement was assessed and absorbed by the line having the road haul. Tariffs were constructed as to permit of such service and they have been so construed throughout all these years. The purpose of the new rule is to bring the practice of the Missouri Pacific into line with that of other carriers and to practically prohibit the use of its team tracks for other than shipments received over its own line. The only alternative to a positive prohibition is the distance rates, the minimum charge tor which would be three cents per hun - dred weight. This would result in a charge per car so high as to be prohibitive. In the instant case, for example, such a charge would be equal to the charge for the road haul on a shipment of sand from the pits of the Consumers Sand company at Yutan into Omaha, a dis - tance of twenty miles. The Company relies principally on two grounds to justify the elimination of the old rule. First, it contends that its team tracks are its private property and that they cannot be used for the benefit of competitor carriers. Its second reason is that its terminal facilities in Omaha are greatly congested and that to permit the use of Its team tracks for shipments received from other carriers is to increase such congestion and impair the service rendered to its own shippers. While the rule as to the use of team tracks is as above described there is no warrant for the assumption that such carrier property is not ■abject to use by the general public. Waverly Oil Work* t. Pennsylvania Railroad Company, 280 I. C. C. 621. As is well stated by Commissioner Prouty in that case "there is nothing sacred about the terminals of a railroad. They are available to the public and may be regulated by the public in exactly the same way that any other part of a railroad can be. No portion of the property of a railroad can be taken without due process of law nor without just compensa- </seg>
            <seg id="p534">534 ion, but to require of a railroad to put any portion of its property to a public service at a just rate is not to take it without due process of law." This theory, so far as interstate commerce is concerned, has &gt;een written into the federal law by an amendment adopted bv congress on February 28, 1920, which clothes the Interstate Com - merce Commission with power to require a carrier to submit the use of any of its terminal facilities to the use of other carriers on such erms and for such compensation as may be agreed upon or fixed by he Commission. Subsequently to that amendment the Interstate Commerce Commission in Team Tryk Switching at Argentine, Kansas, 73 I. C. C. 367, sustains the principle that team tracks of common carriers may be opened to the use of connecting carriers and uses the olio wing language: "At the time of the decision referred to the act provided that section 3 should 'not be construed as requiring any such common carrier to give the use of its tracks or terminal facilities to another carrier engaged in like business.' In the act as amended by the transportation art. 1920. that proviso was omitted and a paragraph inserted in section S under which we may require the use of one carrier's terminal facilities by another when in the public interest, where it is practicable and does not substantially impair the ability of tin- terminal carrier to handle its own busi - ness. The present arrangement is clearly practicable: is shown to be in the public interest: and respondent has not shown that its ability to handle its own business is substantially impaired by existing arrangement. No showing is made as to the volume of traffic handled at its Argentine tracks other than general state - ments that the tracks are frequently congested, which statements are denied by witnesses for protestants. Nor has it made any effort to show that the charges for switching from its connecting lines to those tracks are not compensatory for the service rendered." In that case the same objections to throwing open the team tracks o general use were made as are made in this case. The Commission overruled the objections, however, and ordered the carrier to mak I &gt;lacement of cars at its team tracks regardless of whether they were o have a road haul over competitive lines or not. In our opinion the grant of power to this Commission through the constitutional provision creating the Commission (Section 20. Article IV) is fully as broad as he amendment to the transportation act above referred to and we lave the power to impose the same requirements. No evidence was submitted by the company to show what a compensatory charge for switching service to the team tracks should be. There is an unsup - &gt;orted statement by one of the witnesses that the switching charge s Insufficient, but he admitted that he was not competent to pass upon that point. Another and perhaps equally important legal question is presented In this case, although not met by the company. It is as to whether </seg>
            <seg id="p535">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 535 or not under the charter of the corporation team track service may be required on all shipments regardless of their origin. The road was originally chartered on September 10, 1883. It was organized under the name of The Omaha Belt Railway company. The articles of incorporation provide that as such company it "shall be known and do business." The articles also provide that "the termini of said railroad shall both be in the city of Omaha, Douglas County, State of Nebraska." The route of the road is described with particularity, forming generally a belt about the city of Omaha. The charter pro - vides that there may be "branch lines therefrom to any point or points in Douglas county, Nebraska, deemed necessary — and especially to iiny railroad depot and to any warehouse — shop — manufactury or public place in the said city of Omaha, on such practicable route or toutes as may be deemed advisable and hereafter determined upon"; and further that "said railway in a general way to form a circle or belt line around the business portion of said city of Omaha, with branches therefrom as may be deemed convenient and necessary." This belt line was organized under the general railroad statute. At that time it does not appear to have been connected with any other railway organization although some of its stockholders were officers or stockholders of the Union Pacific Railroad company. It is apparent, however, that the company was organized for the purpose of doing a belt line or terminal business in the city of Omaha. Manifestly, it could have no road haul traffic. Its service was limited to that of a purely switching road. On January 19, 1910, the Omaha Belt Rail - way company sold and conveyed to the Missouri Pacific Railway com - pany all of its railroad and other property, rights, privileges and franchises, powers and immunities. Subsequently the property was transferred by the Missouri Pacific Railway company to the Missouri Pacific Railroad corporation in Nebraska and is so held at the present time. The mere transfer of ownership does not relieve the carrier of its charter obligations. It will be observed that in the transfer from the Omaha Belt Line company to the Missouri Pacific Railway company all rights, privileges, franchises, powers and immunities were conveyed along with the physical property. It is illogical to assume that the Missouri Pacific Railway company could have acquired the rights, privileges and franchises granted by the charter of the Belt Line company without assuming at the same time the obligations that were incurred by the Belt Line company when it secured Its (barter. Among these obligations was the duty to furnish service to any "railroad depot, warehouse, shop, manufactury or public place in the city of Omaha." Team tracks under the manner in which they had been treated by this company in the past are, without doubt. "public places." It would appear, therefore, that respondent com - pany has assumed an obligation to furnish service to team tracks on its lines in Omaha and that it has not, at least by any evidence shown in this record, divested itself of such obligation. For all of the forty </seg>
            <seg id="p536">536 years since the belt line was organized delivery of carload shipments has been made to team tracks regardless of the line of railroad over which they have reached Omaha. We are of the opinion, therefore, that unless there is merit in the second objection raised by respondent the rule should not be abrogated at this time. k There is very little evidence in the record to show that conges - is caused by the setting of cars received from other lines to Um tracks of respondent. Out of a total of 39,781 cars handled in switching service in Omaha by respondent in 1922 only 1,375 can were received from other railroads and set at team tracks. This is ss than three and one-half per cent of the total and represents only &gt;out four cars for each working day in the year. This is only ne-half car per team track per day. Manifestly, this class of traffic ontributes but little to the congestion. Since it is the only traffic tat would be affected by the new rule the relief from this source ould be nominal. Certain other practices permitted by the company ontribute fully as much to any congestion that may result at times. "or instance, the company permits a shipper having an industry on ts belt line the double privilege of unloading either at his own in - ustry or at any one of the public team tracks. It was charged by omplainant, and admitted by the company, that shippers could, by ayment for the privilege, secure the use of industry tracks for the nloadlng of commodities nearer to the point of consumption. In ne instance several hundred carloads of sand were sent to an industry track which had been sub-let to a contractor. Such use of the facili - ties not only greatly prefer holders of industry track locations but they would appear to complicate the use of such team track facilities as are available. No evidence other than the unsupported statement of one witness was submitted to show that there is congestion of the switching facilities of the company in Omaha. Such assertion is dis - puted by complainant. As we have shown the modification of the lule as desired by the company would afford little, if any, relief. The Commission is, therefore, of the opinion that the rule applied for by the company, and hitherto approved by this Commission, is not reasonable under all the circumstances and that the previous status should be restored.

Within the prescribed time respondent railroad company filed a motion for a rehearing asking that it be permitted to introduce new and additional testimony to show (1) that its team tracks are at the present time greatly congested and that to permit use of said tracks for shipments from other carriers would increase such congestion and impair the service rendered to its own shippers and to industries located on industry tracks served by the belt line; (2) that the switching charge allowed for the switching of cars from other lines to the Missouri Pacific team tracks is conftscatory and not compensatory ; (3) that the said original Omaha Belt Line Railway company was not organized for the sole purpose of being a switching road, that it is an integral part of the Missouri Pacific Railroad com- </seg>
            <seg id="p538">538 pany in Nebraska and is not different from similar lines owned bv other railway companies in Omaha. Certain shippers filed a motion of intervention in which they set p that they are individuals, associations, corporations and partner - hips doing business in Omaha and have an interest in the order; lat they were not notified of original proceedings; that they own and perate extensive, permanent industry plants on tracks of the Missouri Pacific in Omaha and receive and forward carload shipments to and rom such industries; that if the order becomes effective the business f interveners will be adversely affected; that such order will have le effect of creating unjust and unreasonable discriminations and nfair and unequal commercial conditions between shippers located n the Missouri Pacific and shippers on other railroads serving Omaha. The motion for rehearing was granted and such hearing had on March 20. In support of its contention that the rates and charges for switch - ing cars from connecting carriers to its own team tracks are not ompensatory the Missouri Pacific presented Mr. F. A. Clifford, specia. ssistant to the general manager, who had made a cost study of witching in Omaha in November, 1920. The results of this study were testified to by Mr. Clifford and showed that the direct cost for witching cars to team tracks was $6,298. If to this were added allow - nces for interest, taxes and return on the investment the total cost ecame $8.40 per car. It was admitted by Mr. Clifford that th&gt; f setting cars to industries was greater and on the same basis would each $9.27 per car. The methods for conducting this investigation nd the basis upon which the costs were calculated appear to have been fair but it should be remembered that the study was made in he fall of 19 20 when costs of all kinds were at their peak and when he heavy traffic congested terminals in Omaha as well as elsewhere. t was conceded by Mr. Clifford that the figures would for these reasons be subject to some modification. Switching rates in Omaha range from $2.25 to $7.20 per car with an average of $4.08 per car. It Is apparent, therefore, that if fr. Clifford's figures are correct the company is realizing less than lalf the actual cost of performing switching service. In the opinion of Mr. Clifford switching rates throughout the Missouri Pacific system are too low. Assuming these costs to be correct it is very significant hat the only rate the company has for team track delivery is a mini - mum of three cents per hundred weight, which amounts, on a car of sand, to $30 per car. Manifestly such a rate is prohibitive. No effort s made by the company to submit what it regards as a reasonable rate for the service to be performed. As we view it the obligation is </seg>
            <seg id="p539">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 539 upon the carrier to initiate rates. And in this instance such obliga - tion haa not been discharged. Mr. Clifford is not a rate man and disclaimed any knowledge of what a reasonable rate should be. In view of the company's evident willingness to perform switching service of all kinds for what it claims to be one-half of cost, there would appear to be no reason to single out one particular service and ask it to pay seven or eight times what such cost is said to be. This appears the less reasonable since the company has been performing the service for over 4 0 years without extra charge. If it were to pro - pose a comprehensive readjustment of all its switching charges so as to place them upon what it regards as a compensatory basis there might be justification for an increase in its switching rates on the Belt Line. But in the absence of such general readjustment it would ppear to be discriminatory to single out any specific rate for special ment on a cost basis CONGESTION mly new evidence submitted as to congestion is a recast of showing of carloads handled in switching service for the year 1922, supplemented by a detailed statement of cars handled at each team track during the months of July, August, September and October. l slated in the original opinion there were 1,375 cars received from mnectlng carriers and set to Missouri Pacific team tracks in 1922. The point sought to be made by the new showing is that an average per team track per day over a period of a year does not reflect the actual conditions, since the bulk of the sand and gravel traffic is handled during the summer months and produces a peak situation at that time. This is true and the figures confirm it, although an analysis discloses that the condition was never serious for any length of time. For example, we have selected the periods of heaviest move - ment and the team tracks most frequently used and find that the largest number of cars handled and the average per day were as follow important considerations tend to overcome the conclusions claimed: first, for most of the congested period the shopmen's strike was in progress and motive power was seriously impaired, making prompt Number of Average per Month Track OMI I&gt;a&gt; August 30th and Boyd 327 12 1-2 June West Lawn 237 9 3-26 July Smileys Switch 140 5 3-10 September Walnut Hill 194 7 6-13 In this calculation 26 working days to the month have been used These figures include the cars received from foreign lines. Twc </seg>
            <seg id="p540">540 movement of cars difficult. While interveners testified to delay and ongeatlon in 1922 they reported but little trouble in 1923. Second, le remedy herein proposed would avail nothing, since the same umber of cars of sand and gravel would have been handled by the issouri Pacific over the same tracks. The testimony is uncontroverted lat these commodities must of necessity be delivered at the team racks In question on account of their accessibility to paving projects n the vicinity. The only change produced therefore by the new rule would be that these shipments would originate at pits on the Missouri Pacific. The movement In the Omaha yards might be facilitated slightly, as the cars would not have to be transferred from and to other railroads. This advantage, however, would be slight. The ap - plication of the rule proposed by the company would, therefore, not divert traffic to other terminals in Omaha and thus relieve the facilities of the Missouri Pacific. It would only force all traffic to the Missouri Pacific and the congestion, If any, would continue as great as before. LEGAL STATl'S OF BELT LJXE For answer to the previous finding of the Commission that the harter granted to the Omaha Belt Railway company defined the haracter of service to be performed by that company and set the measure of its obligations as a common carrier, respondent companv nbmits a copy of the original articles of incorporation and cites the tatute governing incorporation of railroads in effect at that time, n the original opinion we referred to the "Charter"' of the Omaha Belt Railway company and quoted from it to show the general pur - poses of the corporation. It now appears that the incorporators filed wo documents, one with the secretary of state and the other with he county clerk of Douglas county. The first they referred to aa The Certificate of Association." It is this document from which we quoted in the former report. Evidently the incorporators. among whom was John M. Thurston, general attorney for the Union Pacific, onsidered that such certificate was required, since the following anguage occurs in the articles of incorporation later filed with the lerk of Douglas county: "For which purpose we have on the 10th day of September, A. D., 1883, made, and on the same day filed in the office of the secretary of state of said state, the certificate of association, duly executed and proved as required by section 73 of Chapter 16 of the compiled statutes of Nebraska and we hereby adopt the follow - ing articles of incorporation." Respondent cites the statute of 1883 to show that it was not necessary to set out in detail the purposes of a railroad corporation but that three things only were required: </seg>
            <seg id="p541">NEBRASKA STATE RXILWAY COMMISSION 541 "ill The name assumed by such company and by which it shall be known and do business; (2) The names of the places of the termini of said road and the county or counties through which said road shall pass; (3) The amount of the capital stock necessary to con - struct said road." Perhaps out of an abundance of caution the organizers of the Omaha Belt Railway company went farther in explaining their inten - tions than the law required. Be that as it may, the document in question left no doubt as to what kind of a railroad they Intended to run. and if it had, the fact that for over forty years it has been operated as a belt line engaged in purely terminal or switching service leaves no uncertainty as to what they had In mind. The "Certificate of Asso - ciation," coupled with long practice, is an unmistakable admission as to the character of the service involved, and the mere transfer of ownership to the Missouri Pacific Railroad company does not, in our opinion, alter the situation. Moreover, the nature of the railroad and the service it has always rendered differentiates it from regular carriers who perform road haul as well as switching service. GENERAL CONCLUSIONS The rule that team tracks are private property and cannot be used for the benefit of competing carriers is not without its exceptions. While private property, such tracks, like all the other facilities of a railroad, are subject to a public use. In this case it is shown that the only alternative shippers have if they do not desire to secure sand and gravel from pits on the Missouri Pacific is to haul by track for long distances across the city of Omaha or pay a road haul rate. The early occupancy of certain sections of the city by the Belt Line has pre - vented other carriers from establishing unloading facilities in the same sections, so that so far as a wide territory is concerned the Missouri Pacific now enjoys a monopoly. In Grand Trunk Railway v. Michigan Railway &lt;"&lt;«niniission. 231 U. S. 457, the supreme court of the United States had under consideration a situation very similar to that involved here. The Grand Trunk sought to change its tariffs so as to provide for an added charge on cars received from other carriers and set to its own team tracks in the city of Detroit, this charge being in addition to the regular switching rate. The difference In the two cases is that here the Missouri Pacific seeks in effect to close its team tracks altogether to the traffic from other lines, while in the other the Grank Trunk desired to assess an added charge for such use. The court points out that Detroit is a city of 22 miles in extent and has a population of 500,000. The railroad company was thus attempting </seg>
            <seg id="p542">542 o localize an area of 22 miles and make it a destination point. "To call the service necessary to place cars at convenient points within lis area a taking of terminals," says the court, "is misleading und uts out of view the full signification of the question which the record •resents, which is, is there a distinct and sufficient movement between [aces which the companies can be required to perform, or which, to ut it another way, constitutes transportation and therefore such s the companies were created to perform?" The court adds "that ars may be delivered or received is but an incident. The statute lerefore is a regulation of the business of appellants, not an appropria - on of their terminal facilities for the use and benefit of other roads." fter reviewing various leading cases the court states its final con - usions as follows: "In the case at bar a shipper is contesting for the right as a part of transportation. The order of the Commission was a re - cognition of the right and legally so. Considering the theatre of the movements. I lie facilities for them are no more terminal or switching facilities than the depots, side tracks and main lines are terminal facilities in a less densely populated district. A pre - cise distinction between facilities can neither be expressed nor enforced. Transportation is the business of railroads, and when that business may be resukited and to what extent regulated may depend upon circumstances. No inflexible principle of decision can be laid down. This wwm recogalaed in Wisconsin etc. R. K. Co. v. Jacobson. supra. There the court was careful not to say that under no circumstances could an order requirine track connections between intersecting roads be a violation of constitutional rights. "It would depend," it was said, "upon the facts surrounding the cases in regard to which judgment was given And in many cases questions of degree are the controlling ones by which to determine the validity, or the reverse, of legislative action." Indeed, no case could better illustrate the value of the principle than does this case, where the exceptional situation of Detroit as shown by the record, the relation of the tracks in controversy to that situation, their length and their functions, as respects the commerce of Detroit which in the nature of things tli.v p. rform, not merely as instruments of terminal service and delivery, but of railway transportation in the completest sense, are essential and controlling factors in the determination of the question presented. To which controlling conditions there must of course be added the fact that the railroad itself for a long period of time had re - cognized the situation and had applied the tracks to uses of transportation in the proper sense as distinguished from mere terminal service, a use which was only abandoned or sought to be abandoned when authority was exerted to prevent unreasonable and to secure reasonable charges for the services." If, as the court found in this case, it was discriminatory for the carrier to assess a different and greater charge for delivery of cars to team tracks than it assessed for the delivery of cars to industry tracks Jt would appear to be discriminatory under circumstances such as obtain here. </seg>
            <seg id="p543">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 543 In a later case. Louisville &amp; Nashville R. R. v. United States, 238 V. S. 1, the Court reasserts the same doctrine. In that case the rail - road company sought to assess a charge of $3 per car for switching non-competitive business between industries within terminal limits. The court said: "In this case the controlling feature of the (Interstate Com - merce) Commission's order is the prohibition against discrimina - tion. It was based upon the fact that the appellants were at the present time furnishing switching service to each other on all business, and to the Tennessee Central on all except coal and competitive business. As long as the Yard remained open and was used as a facility for switching purposes the Commission had the power to pass an order — not only prohibiting discrimination — but requiring the appellants to furnish equal facilities 'to all persons and corporations without undue preference to any parti - cular class of persons.' " We are of the opinion and so find that the order should not be disturbed. Made and entered at Lincoln, Nebraska, this nineteenth day of August. 1924. NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION Thorne A.

Chairman: (Concurring) — I agree with the con - clusions above, but not with the reasoning which attaches much im - portance to the original articles of incorporation.

Made and entered at Lincoln, Nebraska, this twenty-ninth day of March, 1924. NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION Thorne A. Browne, Chairman Etest: John E. Curtiss, Secretary. EAL) RESOLUTION NO. m rthe Matter of the Investigation of Common Carrier Bus Lines wit Reference to Adequate Liability Insurance. OPINION AM) FINDING TAYLOR, Commissioner Information having come to the Commission that certain motor usses were being operated for hire within the state without adequate rotection to passengers, a resolution was adopted citing the owners f such common carrier bus lines to appear before the Commission nd show cause why they should not be required to provide adequate nd sufficient liability insurance and comply with such other require - ments for the safety of operation as the Commission might deem roper. Hearing upon this citation was had in the office of ihe i, mm - mission on Friday, April 25. Eight operators appeared in response o the citation as follows: Mrs. F. E. Shaner, White Bus Line, Lin - oln-Nebraska City; C. R. Hubbard. Lincoln-York; Kred A. Muir, ork-Columbus-Norfolk; George Armand, Lincoln- Beatrice; George oldsberry, Pawnee-Table Rock; Frank E. Hollingsworth, Beatrice- Fairbury; Max S. Gleason, Columbus-Norfolk; R. J. Walsh, Omaha - incoln. / </seg>
            <seg id="p545">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMM.SSION 545 Examination of these operators discloses a rather chaotic condi - tion in this particular field of transportation. Only three out of the eight carry liability insurance, two having a coverage of $5,000 tor one passenger and $10,000 for all. The third carries a policy providing or $10,000 for one passenger and $20,000 as a maximum. One of he others has carried liability insurance but is not doing so now on account of the cost. The remainder stated that they had never given onsideration to carrying such insurance or that if they had done bo were deterred on account of their business not justifying the cost. The business appears to be fairly well established between Lin - oln and Beatrice, Lincoln and Nebraska City. Lincoln and Omaha, and .incoln and Fremont. A line has been operated with only moderate egularity between Lincoln and York. Doubtless there are other ines in Nebraska operating with considerable regularity but they were not represented at this hearing. The lines radiating front Lin - oln operate busses with seating capacities ranging from sixteen to wenty four passengers. Three out of the eight operate touring cars. One of these operating between Columbus and Norfolk has two such passenger touring cars, the original cost of which was $?50. While hese are seven passenger cars he has carried at times as high as hirteen in one car, sometimes for a distance of sixteen miles. Practically all admitted overloading their vehicles at times, the over - load in two or three cases amounting to as much as 50 per cent. There is no uniformity in rules and regulations for safe operation. When questioned as to the method for selecting drivers the operators pave widely different answers. One confessed to having no standard for such selection while another will not engage an unmarried man, nor one under twenty-seven years of age. The latter would also require good character, a good disposition and clean moral habits. Several of the operators stated that they would not knowingly hire a drinking man as a driver. The maximum speed fixed for the busses range from 25 to 30 miles per hour. The operators asserted quite vigorously that these speeds are not exceeded. Drivers are cautioned to stop at railroad crossings, although exceptions are made by some operators where branch line railroads are involved. A statement of gross revenues and expenses made by each operator indicates that the motor bus industry in this state is still in a pioneer stage and has yet gained only a precarious toothold. Tho e w.io have operated longest are making allowances for depreciation, but several stated that they give it no consideration in calculating their expense. The chief objection to carrying liability insurance is that it is too expensive. Some of the operators 'stated that they would have to abandon opera - tion if required to carry such insurance. Mr. Armand, one of the partners operating the line between Lincoln and Beatrice, stated it as his opinion that licensing drivers and requiring them to pass rigid ;s </seg>
            <seg id="p546">546 examinations would be more effective than requiring bonds for the protection of passengers. He stressed the importance of keeping the motor busses in first-class mechanical condition, particularly the tires. Out of the group of operators at this hearing only one reported serious accidents. This was the White Bus Line operated between Lincoln and Nebraska City, and which is one of the oldest lines in the state. It has had two or three accidents in which one woman was injured so seriously that she died, and a number of others received minor injuries. It is a matter of note that out of the eight lines represented at the hearing only one is operated by a corporation. The others are operated by Individuals or partnerships. Two of the individual operators state that they have no property other than their equity in their cars. I'pon such a showing the Commission is of the opinion thai th« afety of the public traveling; in motor busses is not at the present me properly safe-guarded and we believe that all such common arriers operating within the state of Nebraska should be required o furnish surety bonds for the protection of their passengers. It would appear that if the public demand for carriers of this nature s not general enough to produce a revenue sufficient to pay all operat - ng expenses, including a reasonable insurance against loss of life and limb, it is not sufficient to warrant their operation at all. Tt does not seem to be any necessity for regulation of rates or schedi tthi.s particular time. When th pioneer stage has been passed irable. industry becom^ mch regulation will i The jurisdiction of the Commission over m L Section 15124.

In Slate v. I'nion Stuck Yards Company, Ml Xeb. «7, the supreme court of Nebraska construed the above provisions and used the follow - ing language in defining "common carrier": "Any person or corporation holding itself out to the public as offering its services to all persons similarly situated, and per - forming as its public vocation the services of transporting pas - sengers, freight or intelligence, is a common carrier in the par - ticular spheres of such employment." We are of the opinion, therefore, that we should assume jurisdic - tion of motor bus lines operating in Nebraska in so far as is necessary to require such common carriers to carry liability insurance and to take such other measures for the protection of their passengers as the Commission may deem necessary and proper.

Powell, rate expert OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Chairman This matter came on for hearing before the Commission En motion. That motion was bottomed upon a very considerable lowledge of the movement of and demand for sand and gravel, rticularly the latter, in Nebraska at this time; the location of pits a position to furnish such material, and the particular rate struc - re now in effect in Nebraska covering the charges for movement these commodities. The carriers are interested primarily in the revenues received from lis tonnage. Mineral aggregate miners are primarily interested in le competitive situation. The heavy consumers of these commodities, particularly in the construction of all weather road surfaces, are rimarily interested in the final cost of the commodity and there - ore in the cost factor of the transportation charge. However, in - ormal complaints have been made to the Commission from the third roup mentioned above, all to the effect that gravel rates particularly re too high. This conclusion usually is based upon the relation of le price of the commodity at point of origin to the freight rate, a lasis which cannot be conclusive evidence. tThis Commission would be remiss if it did not insist that freigh tes be so adjusted as to give the greatest freedom to the movement commodities consistent with proper compensation for the services is not limited to consideration of cases on complaint. t Opportunity was afforded the miners of gravel and sand to testify the matter under investigation. For the most part those present not desire to do so. The carriers were united in objection to joint </seg>
            <seg id="p551">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 551 rates for reasons best set forth by the witness for the Burlington. These reasons may be summarized as follows: .1 1 Because of the locations of sand pits in the state, practically inis can be served by single line movement. &gt; I) i To the extent that joint hauls would cause transfer of loaded gondola equipment from the owning road to the delivering road, in excess of transfers under the present rate structure, it would result in loss of equipment to the owning carrier. &lt;ci To the extent that joint rates would encourage joint hauls, would reduce the revenue of the participating carriers, each one which on joint hauls now gets a minimum rate of 70 cents per ton. Id) Joint rates are almost unknown on such low grade com - ulities. lei If joint rates are to be published, the transfer should be presented by a charge adequate to compensate for the additional to equipment and for two additional terminal movements Counsel for carriers also registered objection to any order pro - ilnatiiiK joint rates, because the resolution did not indicate the on which such an order might be predicated, that Is, the carrier not given notice as to whether a charge should be made for the ifer. and what charge, if any, was contemplated. We do not con- ler the objection well taken. The resolution was adopted in order at the investigation be wide enough to indicate the propriety of an tier for joint rates, and, if the answers were in the affirmative, what condition such joint rates should be promulgated. We consider the objections raised by the carriers as summarized (a) The location of sand pits in the state makes it possible by single line hauls to serve practically any locality in the state. On the whole joint rates will not be widely used if charges are mada to cover the transfer cost. Certain localities however can only be served by single line movement from rather distant points. The product of sand pits does not move to a common center as is the case with most agricultural products now moving usually on single line commodity rates. It Is clear that if all sand pits were located at one place, served by one railroad only, joint rates would be a necessity. The question here is whether the lack of proper joint rates presents ;i barrier to the meeting of demand with supply, and whether such barrier, it' it exists, can be removed without establishing unreasonably low rates. </seg>
            <seg id="p552">552 (b) The objection here applies equally to all joint haul car - load movements and is of force only If joint rates are entirely un - necessary and their existence causes a loss of equipment to the originating carrier which is unessential. (c) If the through rate is not less than the sum of the locals, no occasion for joint rates would exist. The purpose of through rates is to establish a lower through charge through recognition that less terminal services are rendered than is represented in two independent local movements. (d) This relates particularly to the preceding objection. Witnesses for the carriers were not agreed as to the amount of terminal service required in joint hauls as compared with the amount of terminal service in two single line hauls of the same aggregate mileage. That there is less terminal cost and less delay to equipment appears self evident. (e) It is true that generally speaking joint rates do not exist n these low grade short haul commodities. Joint rates were not pparently essential on these commodities so long as their use was s restricted as was formerly the case. With the advent of much lighway hard surfacing, has come a tremendous increase in tonnage moving to widely separated points, many of them destinations which ormerly would only occasionally purchase a carload of such material, 'his use bids fair to be greatly increased in the next few years with onsequent constantly Increasing tonnage. As has been pointed out tie movement is peculiar in that a very considerable amount of the otal tonnage has no central destination. The carrier is interested in retaining the long haul. This is a evenue interest. That position is justifiable within limits. The uestion here presented is whether the present limits are too broad. Arbitrary transfers from the carrier furnishing the equipment, and urnishing the originating terminal services should not be encouraged. For that reason the transfer charge should be sufficient to pay for lie cost of the delay to the equipment and the switching services. It was urged by the carriers that if joint rates are established hey should be at a charge of two cents per cwt. over the single line ate for like aggregate distances. Such a charge would in many nstances make the through rate higher than the sum of the locals under the present tariff. Joint rates should either not be published t all or be available to prevent unnecessary hauling. check of the tariffs indicates a considerable number of points ere joint rates would be advantageous. Many of these points have </seg>
            <seg id="p553">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 553 t at present no considerable demand for these commodities. The road construction program makes a constant potential demand. It has heen our purpose to provide a rate fabric for the movement of sand, gravel and crushed stone which will be immediately available when - ever the demand arises. For that reason we are of the opinion and so find that the carriers t-rvinK Nebraska intrastate in the movement of the commodities here under consideration should establish joint rates over not more than two roads and we further find that the reasonable charges for such joint hauls should be not more than one cent per cwt. higher than the single line charges for equivalent aggregate distances.

Thurston County Farm Bureau lined to the Commission that by reason of the tact that the St. Paul. Minneapolis &amp; Omaha Railway company did not n fattening in transit privileges similar to those provided by r carriers operating in this state, the feeders of livestock in n county were discriminated against in their efforts to feed n transit at stations located on said company's line of rail - that the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad company not allow feeding in transit at stations on its line in Thurston uy when destined to the market at South Omaha. The Burlington ion of the informal complaint was disregarded for the present. TKSTIMOXY The rate department of the Commission showed that all of the carriers operating in Nebraska except the Chicago, St. Paul, Minne - apolis &amp; Omaha Railway company, hereinafter called Omaha, have established fattening in transit privileges for a period of one year at stations on their lines in Nebraska in varying degrees as to the point of origin from which cattle might be shipped to intermediate stations then to Omaha at a charge of eight and one-half cents per 100 pounds. At stations not directly intermediate between the point of origin and the market, cattle might be stopped in transit to fatten at a charge of eleven and one-half cents and fourteen cents for the stopping in transit privilege. </seg>
            <seg id="p556">556 tin Resolution No. 74 which had to do with the establishment of estock rates from stations on the Chicago &amp; North Western Rail - y, hereinafter called the Northwestern, and the Omaha road the mmission found that the two lines of road just named should be isidered as one line of railroad. The Interstate Commerce Com - ssion has heretofore found that the Northwestern Railway and the laha should be considered as one line of railroad. LThe Northwestern Railway provides in its tariff that cattle may stopped to fatten in transit at any station west of Fremont directly intermediate between the point of origin and South Omaha at a charge of eight and one-half cents per cwt. to be added to the thru rate from the point of origin to Omaha; that cattle may be stopped to fatten in transit at any station on its line of railroad east of Neligh, on the Hastings branch as far west as York, on the Superior branch as far west as Seward, on the Scribner and the Lincoln branches at a charge of eight and one-half cents per cwt. plus the thru rate from point of origin to South Omaha, and on cattle originating west of Neligh (■topped at stations Hadar to Verdigre inclusive, Charleston to Hast - ings inclusive, Goehner to Superior inclusive, stopped in transit to fatten at a charge of eleven and one-half cents plus the rate from point of origin to Omaha. Stations west of Niobrara a charge of fourteen and one-half cents per cwt. is made for stopping to feed In transit cattle originating at stations west of Neligh plus the thru rate from point of origin to Omaha. The rate department further showed that the Omaha company has established rates on carload shipments of cattle from Norfolk to stations on its line in Nebraska except south of Emerson which ore based on 75% of the fat cattle rates from Sioux City to said stations. The establishment of these rates, according to the testimony ol Mr. Mintz has had the effect of placing Norfolk on an equality with the markets at Sioux City and Omaha on cattle originating at either of the last mentioned cities and shipped back to the Omaha stations mentioned in this paragraph for fattenfng purposes. Mr. Winter, local county agent for Thurston county, testified that special effort was being made by the farm bureau to encourage the fattening of livestock on the farms in that county and that the corn in Thurston county this year will largely have to be fed to live - stock on account of an early frost having damaged the crop. DEFENDANTS Mr. H. A. Mintz, assistant general freight agent of the Omaha, appeared on behalf of the North Western and the Omaha lines and testified that the testimony regarding the fattening in transit privileges </seg>
            <seg id="p557">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 557 on the Northwestern had been correctly stated; that the Omaha com - pany does not maintain at the present time, fattening In transit privi - leges at any of its stations on its line of railroad; that he thought the present rates on livestock were lower than the cost of the services Justi - tied and that there should not be added privileges established which would tend to increase the present cost of handling livestock in Ne - braska; that while it was true that the Nebraska Commission and the • nierstate Commerce Commission had, in several rate cases, found that the Northwestern and the Omaha roads should be considered as one line of railroad, the facts are, that the Northwestern and the Omaha companies are "separate and distinct carriers working very closely together"; that if the Omaha established fattening in transit privileges at its stations in Nebraska It would be placed on the defensive in other territories on its line outside of Nebraska. Mr. Mintz further testified that: "If the Commission, after a study of this case and from what has developed here this morning and afternoon, believe that some relief is necessary to the man who might want to purchase his stock on the ranch, then the way to solve the problem is not in establishing the feed in transit arrangement. Sufficient relief certainly would be given if you will apply 75 per cent of the fat cattle rate. I am not saying that the men at the feeding point should be given that rate because we can't stand reduction in our revenue, but if your Commission believe that any relief is neces - sary, that is absolutely all that he should have." In connection with his testimony Mr. Mintz submitted an exhibit which showed in a comparative way the rates on carload shipments of cattle from representative stations on the Northwestern to Omaha, Nebraska, when stopped at representative stations on the Omaha to fatten in transit. The station of Wayne on the Omaha was selected as one of the representative stations. The exhibit shows that on a shipment originating at Creighton, a Northwestern station, consigned to Wayne and there fed and then forwarded to Omaha for sale, the thru rate on such a shipment at the present time is forty-one cents that under the 7 5 per cent basis as mentioned by him the thru rates would be thirty-six and one-half cents; if a charge of eleven and one - half cents was established for the stopping in transit to fatten privilege, the thru rate would be thirty-five and one-half cents; that the same comparison on a shipment of cattle originating at Chadron stopped to fatten in transit at Wayne, on the three bases above mentioned would be as follows: fifty-eight and one-half cents at the present time, forty-nine and one-half cents on the 75 per cent basis, forty-nine and one-half cents on the eleven and one-half cents fattening in transit privilege basis. Numerous other stations were shown on the exhibit which show substantially the same comparative rate situation as stated above. </seg>
            <seg id="p558">558 In the exhibit mentioned in the preceding paragraph. Mr Mintz shows what the rates would he from the same point of origin on the Northwestern, fed at the same stations on the Omaha, final destina - tion Sioux City based on a rate of eight and one-half cents for the privilege of stopping in transit to latten at stations directly inter - mediate between Norfolk and Sioux City. The Commission, in Resolution No. 74. found that the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway company and the Chicago. St. Paul. Minne - apolis &amp; Omaha Railway company should be considered as MM rail - road in applying the livestock distance tariff rates found reasonable in said resolution. We are of the opinion and so find that tke two r ads mentioned in this paragraph should be considered as one Mm of railroad as to the fattening in transit privilege »The question of what the rates should be for this servi&lt; e has been en careful consideration. We agree with the contention of Mr. ntz that the out of line haul established by the Northwestern road the eight and one-half cents rate as tar south as York on t li*- Hast- |;s line and Seward on the Bnperlor ami m the Lincoln branch, feat •n established by the Northwestern largely as a competitive lima d, thereby meeting the rates that have been established by tin rlington from stations located on the Chicago. Burlington A: Quinc; ilroad in Nebraska, final destination Omaha, and that the rstM m ablished should not be used as a measure of establishing the rate; the Omaha on carload shipments of cattle originating at North stern stations stopped to fatten in transit at points on the Omaha final destination Omaha. The suggestion offered by Mr. Mintz in this raeor Commission found that some relief should be granted the Omaha stations as a result of these proceedings, the rates should be found by applying 75 per cent of the distance tariff schedule on continuous mileage basis between Northwestern and Omaha stations, is an innova - tion as a basis for finding the rates for fattening in transit privileges In view of the fact that the Northwestern has adopted the corn - only accepted basis upon which these rates should be established, e are of the opinion and so find that the same general plan of finding tes should be used in establishing the rates to be applied at Omaha ations. The general practice of the lines operating in this state for nding the charge for stopping of cattle in transit to fatten at stations f the direct line of haul, point of origin to market, is to add three nts to the minimum feeding in transit privilege rate of eight and ne-half cents and six cents additional at other points located farther CONCLUSIONS </seg>
            <seg id="p559">NEBEtASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 559 off the direct line haul. Without specifically passing upon the reason - ableness of this method of finding the charges which shall be added to the direct line feeding in transit rate of eight and one-half cents, pproT* this ph.n of establishing the feeding in Wl transit privileges between Northwestern and Omaha stations. approximately forty miles farther from Norfolk to tfouth Omaha via the Omaha than via the Northwestern. Stations on the Omaha do not come in close competition with Burlington points like the stations do that are located on the Northwestern south and west &lt;if Fremont. It is our opinion and we so find that for stations located he Omaha road between Norfolk and Omaha, the fattening in transit privileges should be established on a basis of eleven and one hall i tuts plus the thru rate from Northwestern point of origin to Omaha, and for the stations on the Omaha north of the main line. i to Sioux City, the privilege should be established on a f fourteen and one-half cents, plus the thru rate from point of Omaha here remains to be decided the question as to what the most e;&lt;sternly point of origin should be of cattle originating on the North - west »-rn to be fed in transit at Omaha stations. In the resolution of the Commission heretofore mentioned, the defendants were asked to show cause why the privilege should not be established from all stations north and west of Norfolk. The question of allowing live - stock to stop in transit for the purpose of sale or speculation and later billed to a fattening in transit station and then to a final market for sale is a privilege that is not in effect on the Northwestern in this state. From the record in these proceedings we are of the opinion that the present rates from Norfolk to certain Omaha stations for fatten - ing purposes should not be disturbed. It does appear to us and we so find that the fattening in transit privileges at Omaha stations should be accorded to all stations on the Northwestern, Plainview to Anoka inclusive, at the rates for fattening in transit privileges heretofore stated and that on the Northwestern main line the most easternly point of origin should he Neligh at the rates herein found reasonable for stopping in transit to fatten at points on the Omaha road. We suggest that the Omaha should establish a rule that would provide that cattle might be stopped in transit to fatten at any station on its line of road directly intermediate between the point of origin and South Omaha, at any station north of Blair at a charge of eight and one-half cents per cwt. for the privilege of stopping in transit. If the Omaha does not establish the rates suggested in this paragraph the matter will be further considered by the Commission if it should be again brought up. </seg>

The carriers indicated that they were agreeable that a able rule be established that would allow the mixing of cal cattle and other livestock that would correct the situation w been brought about by the increased rates on carload shipi calves established by the Commission in Resolution No. 7 4. Iym wit There was some testimony presented to the Commission pro and con and as a result of which it was agreed by the Commission, the carriers' and shippers' representatives, that the case should be con - tinued on motion of the carriers and date for further hearing will be 10-:30 a. m. November 14.

BY THE COMMISSION: A shifting of the nature of business transacted by steam carr in Nebraska has occurred, and is occurring, at many stations. 1 than carload traffic, express and passenger traffic have generally t falling off with the growth in number of automobiles. Carload tr fluctuates with crop conditions. Carload traffic requires les* ttm service than other traffic. Because of their desire to effect economies in operation, Nebraska carriers have been using the shifting traffic conditions as basi reducing station help, and, where practicable, for changing from agency station to caretaker station at points where less than carload freight and passenger traffic is inconsiderable The Commission has taken the position that such changes con - stitute such Important amendments to the class and amount of service as to justify presentation thereof to the Commission as applications for authority, to the end that if agency stations are discontinued proper substitute service may be assured. Not all Nebraska carriers have been following this procedure although it has been assumed the position of the Commission was well known. The practice should be uniform for all Nebraska stations. An emergency exists and we find therein justification for taking action effective on less than thirty days' notice to carriers. To that end </seg>

The application was heard ex parte upon Saturday. May 10. and the peremptory writ allowed. On Monday, May 12. a motion was made to vacate the order for the reason that the writ was issued without notice; that it was improvidently issued, the facts stated in the application being untrue; that the order of April 8, 1908. is null and void and was made without jurisdiction, and is in violation of the fourteenth amendment to the constitution of the United States, and is an undue burden upon interstate com - merce.

They appear also to have the confidence of the public, as evidenced by a general increase of service rates by the muni - cipal authorities in practically all of the towns, and by a number of remunerative contracts for the pumping of city water. "The company has by no means reached the highest possible efficiency though it is rapidly progressing in that direction. The construction of additional transmission lines is the greatest need.

To illustrate the manner in which such transactions are handled, we append copy of a journal entry made on the books of the Shenandoah Artificial Ice, Power, Heat and Light Company representing the transfer of certain electrical equipment to the Public Service Company of York, Nebraska. The generator and other equipment had been used and were invoii i".l to the Public Service Company at second-hand values. The coat originally was $1,557. Applicant's opinion as to its condition was 75 per cent of new and the cost price was discounted according - ly. The remainder of the material shown on the invoice was new "The same practice is followed in transfer of property from one location to another within the same company. Credit ts given the property account of the plant from which the property is taken and charged to the plant in which it is placed. A number of such transfers have been made due to the adjustmrnts nec - essary from time to time in the various plants in order to handle additional business, thus enabling applicant to utilize second - hand material to good effect. A prime mover (engine and generator) that has become too small for one plant is often ft. sufficient to handle the load at another plant or it can he added to another plant to good advantage."

The court said: (p. 623) With this conclusion I am unable to agree. The brick com - ias an omnibus charter, under which it can do many things; for present purposes it is enough to note that it was un - &gt;tedly organized for the principal object of doing just what eeded to do, namely, to acquire the stock of the bankrupt, lend it money to carry on the operation of brickmaking certain patents. This, in a few words, is the essential fact present controversy, and to state it is equivalent to draw- onclusion. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania and the Appeals of the Third Circuit unite in deciding that, foreign corporation exercises its charter powers in the i&gt; doing business' therein, and that it cannot recover ntracts made in the exercise of such powers, unless it plied with the provisions of the Pennsylvania statutes us registration and other matters."

In decision the court, after stating many of the facts ctlon, said: (p. 313) Whatever its powers were to act elsewhere is quite apart m the present inquiry as to what it actually did in Pennsyl- vania. It is to be judged by the things it has done here, and not by those it has left undone elsewhere. While we recognize the legal principle that a corporation does not lose its entity by the ownership of the bulk or even the whole of its stock by another corporation (citing authorities), yet it is equally well settled courts will look beyond the mere artificial personality which in - corporation confers, and. if necessary to work out equitable ends, will ignore corporate forms I citing authorities). Indeed, we think the entire controversy was in terse terms summarized by the court below (quoting language quoted above)." </seg>
            <seg id="p584">584 The (acts present in this matter bring the company clearly under he rule laid down in the above cases. As stated above section 67 6 equires not merely the doing of business, but the doing of a public tility business in order to bring the concern under the jurisdiction f the State Railway Commission as to issuance of securities. The uestion then follows: Is the Continental Gas &amp; Electric Corporation oing business in the state of Nebraska within the meaning of sec - ion 676? The courts in determining matters of corporate organiza - lon so far as they pertain to the relations of the corporation to the tate are not bound by the form of organization, but tiny may look irough the form and get at the substance of the matter. Thompson n Corporations, Vol. 1, Sees. 9, et seq. Searclilifcht Hwn Co. v. Am. Gramaphone Co., 240 Fed. 745. Southeastern Elec. Co. v. State Miss.) 124 Am. St. Rep. 638. A mere corporate organization may not be used as a device to defeat the purposes of a statute. As the company may. under its charter, actually operate public utilities, and as it does actually direct the operation of utilities held by the subsidiary companies, and as it treats the properties as though actually owned by it, all as shown by the records above quoted, it tuld appear that the state has the same right to control its securit U68 as it would if the holding company were the operating con pany in name, as well as in fact. From all the matters al&gt;o\&gt; rt it is concluded that the Continental Gas ti Klectric Corpora fact operating utilities in Nebraska. kit is fundamental that a state may prescribe the terms u ilch a foreign corporation may enter and do business within undaries. Paul v. Virginia, 8 Wall. 16 v The state of Nebraska has the power to require a foreign corpora- Jon, doing a public utility business through the intermediary of an - other corporation, to conform to the Stock and Bonds Act. and if the tatute has included such foreign corporation within its terms then pplication should be made to the State Railway Commission before ecurities are issued. One of the principal objects sought by the passage of the Stock nd Bonds Act was to prevent excessive capitalizations as had been o frequently met with before the enactment of the statute; one of its pecific purposes being to prevent over-capitalization that might esult in receivership and consequent impairment of the public service or it is obvious that the over-capitalization of a holding company may esult in financial disaster to the operating company and thus work njury to the public service. </seg>
            <seg id="p585">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 585 Having arrived at the conclusion that the Continental company actually operating public utilities, the next inquiry Is whether or the Commission should sanction an issue of securities by it. In the absence of legislative authority, either directly given or ssarily implied, one corporation cannot become a stockholder in another corporation. Thompson on Corporation. 1922 Supp. Sec. 4056. f I hi art ■ Shirt Co. v. Hoiton. 3 Neb. ( unof. ) 88S. In the last cited case the Supreme Court used the following anguage: (p. 889 "The plaintiff below, as trustee in bankruptcy of the Greater American Exposition, a corporation, sued the defendant, a manu - facturing corporation, upon a stock subscription. The petition leges that the defendant corporation signed, executed and de- ?red to the promoters of the exposition company an agreement take and pay for ten shares of stock of the latter company: that by such agreement it intended to become a stockholder therein; that four different calls were duly made, each for twenty-five per cent of the subscriptions, and that none of said calls were paid. The defendant pleaded that it was a manufactur - ing corporation, organized solely for the manufacture of shirts, a ml claimed that the subscription was made by its manager with- it authority from the directors or stockholders. We are at a loss to see how this action can be maintained the face of the pleadings. Corporations have quite enough power without allowing them to incorporate themselves in new companies. Unless authorized by statute, a corporation has no power to subscribe to the capital stock of another corporation, and such a subscription is not binding." (Citing authorities). The case has been referred to approvingly in State v. Lincoln Traction Co., 90 Neb. 535. See also upon this subject Mannington v. Hocking Valley Rail - way Co., 183 Fed 133. Central Ufe Securities Co. v. Smith, 236 Fed. 170. Bank of Commerce v. Hart, 37 Neb. 197; L. R. A. 1917 B, 835. It may be said that under the rules of interstate comity if a cor - poration may hold stock in other corporations under the law of the state of its organization it may do so in this state, but the constitution of Nebraska negatives such a contention. Section 1 of Article 12 provides: "Foreign corporations transacting or seeking to transact business in this state shall be subject, under general law, to regulation, supervision and general control, and shall not be given greater rights or privileges than are given domestic corporations of a similar character." </seg>

Dear Sir The Railway Commission has submitted the inquiry as to whelht or not it has jurisdiction over rights of way for transm within incorporated villages. The question was raised by M A. Lee, general counsel of the Continental Gas &amp; Electric ( I The statutes referred to by Mr. I^ee are Chapter 15, and Chapter 154, Laws of 1917, the latter being ■ former. In order to determine the question it is m&lt; several of the statutory provisions. The act of 1903, giving the right- of-way on public highways to electric transmission line companies being section 7420, Revised Statutes of 1913. contains the following "PROVIDED, further, nothing herein contained shall be construed to grant any right within the corporate limits of any village or city of the first and second class or metropolitan class in this state." The language of the act of 1915 is general and might be taken tn include transmission lines within incorporated villages, particularly as metropolitan cities and cities of the first and second class are ex - oepted, while villages are not excepted. The title of the act is as follows: "An act to regulate the construction, operation and main - tenance of electric transmission, telephone and telegraph lines in the state of Nebraska and to prescribe penalties for the viola - tion of the same, and to declare an emergency." </seg>

The act of 1921, hapter 259. of the Session Laws of that year, amended A 7420 of the Revised Statutes for 1913.

Spillman, Attorney General By Hugh LaMaster, Assistant Attorney General Lincoln, Nevomber 19, 1924 Honorable Charles A. Randall, Nebraska State Railway Commission, Office. Dear Sir: Recently you submitted to me the following inquiry, which was suggested by Mr. G. \V. Caape, to-wit: </seg>
            <seg id="p589">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 589 Should the Rock Island Railway company operating a local train between Morton. Kansas, and Nelson, Nebraska, a distance of 123 miles, carrying three passenger coaches and a portion of the time freight cars conveying carload shipments have two brakemen? Mr. Caape states that when there are no freight cars handled on this train, only one brakeman is employed, but when freight cars are carried, two brakemen are employed — the inquiry being whether two brakemen should be regularly employed. The statute, section 5336 and 5337. Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, are as follows: "It shall be unlawful for any railroad company doing business in the state of Nebraska to operate or run over its road or any part thereof, or ■suffer or permit to be run over its road or any part thereof, outside of the yard limits, any passenger, mall or express train carrying passengers, whose regular equipment consists of more than five cars, with a crew, consisting of less than one engineer, one fireman, one conductor, one brakeman und one flagman; and further provided, passenger trains whose regular equipment consists of five cars or less, may be operated with a crew consisting of one engineer, one fireman, one con - ductor and one brakeman or flagman." "It shall be unlawful for any railroad doing business in Ne - braska to operate or run over its road, or any part thereof, or to suffer or permit to be operated or run over its road or any part thereof, outside of yard limits any freight train which is not manned with a crew consisting of one engineer, one fireman, one conductor, and two brakemen: Provided, main line local freight trains running one hundred miles or more and carrying pas - sengers, local merchandise and doing station switching shall be provided with a crew consisting of one conductor, one engineer, one fireman and three brakemen." The statute is penal in its nature and cannot be enlarged by con - struction. The term train, refers to the particular train operated. There appears to be no violation of the law so long as the additional brakeman is employed whenever freight cars are run. At the time the foregoing question was submitted, you also sub - mitted the following question: Is the Rock Island Railway company required to employ three brakemen on each of the trains Nos. 85 and 86. running between Fairbury, Nebraska, and Council Bluffs. Iowa, a distance of 119 miles, 115 miles of which are through the state of Nebraska — such trains not carrying passengers? Mr. Caape takes the position that the trains sometimes carry stockmen and officers of the road, such as claim agents, trainmasters, etc. and are therefore passenger trains. </seg>
