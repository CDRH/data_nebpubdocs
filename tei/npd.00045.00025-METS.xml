Much complaint bus been r«gi»l«nyl u«uin»l certain bruin!* of ununule of lead. The above rtaulU show them to be of about equal value, In proportion to the amount of arsenic contained in combination. The reaulti of the last yew's work (191ft) Indicate that con - clusions drawn from the two preceding years' work were in the main correct, I, e., that the efficiency of a ■pray schedule for the control of codling moth depends very litrwly upon thi&gt; thoroness of the petal-fall application. However, tnls application is not In Itself sufficient, even though every ealvx receive a good dose of poison. Approximately 20 per cent of the first-brood "worms" normally enter the fruit at various points, other than the calyx, on unniirnywl trees, The spray materials lodged in the calyces certainly will cause some of tne larva? which would otherwise enter the calyx to seek other place* of entrance, so that the percentage of the larvif which enter the fruit from other points must be npprp - clably Increased. This Is borne out by the fart that even with the most thoro calyx spraying In 101 ft, 20 to 40 per cent of the wwms were controlled by the late applications, Comparing the number of calyx-wormy apples found on the sprayed and the unsfimyed tre.es, the efficiency tit the calyx spray was W7.7 per cem at Beatrice, WM ft per cent at flout h (Imnhn, and Ml per cent «t lilncoln.

            <seg id="p033">Spraying Experiments in Nebraska 33 fact that the orchard was allowed to grow up to grass and weeds, and that windfall apples were allowed to remain under the trees. In the early windfalls, many curculio larvae lived to maturity and thus reinfested the orchard. Considering all the facts known in regard to the life history of the plum curculio and the facts gathered during the last three years' work, the accumulated evidence shows that by taking advantage of certain habits of the insect, its control is compara - tively easy and certain. (1) The adults hibernate during the winter under trash and rubbish in the orchard. (2) After a winter of fasting they are very voracious and in the spring commence feeding on the new leaves and buds before the blossoms are open. (3) The larvae are unable to live to maturity in the apples when they remain on the tree. Only those larvae which are in the apples that fall early reach maturity and become beetles. (4) The larvae begin entering the ground about the middle of July and continue up to the middle of August or later. The pupae cases are placed at an average depth of 1 to 2 inches. Therefore, control measures which suggested themselves and which proved effective are: The removal of trash and rubbish, accompanied by early spring plowing; thoro spraying with arsenate of lead before the blossoms open, followed by the regular codling moth schedule; the removal of early windfalls, which may con - tain larvae, from the orchard ; and lastly, thoro cultivation of the orchard from the middle of July to the middle of August. SPRAYING FOR THE CONTROL OF FUNGOUS DISEASES APPLE SCAB One of the determining factors in the production of apples in Nebraska is the prevalence of apple scab. This disease has long been considered serious and a great deal of work has been done concerning its life history and methods of control. Notwith - standing the fact that its destructiveness is well known and that reasonably sure methods of control have been published, the disease goes merrily on taking its toll of more than 50 per cent of the fruit'of the state. As a matter of fact the loss is often even more than it appears. 1. The young apples drop prematurely, due to the attacks of the fungus upon the flowers and petioles before and during the blossoming period, and on the young fruit later. This was especially noticeable during the seasons of 1913 and 1915. At blossoming time the bloom was as heavy on the check as on the sprayed trees. The set of fruit on the sprayed trees was </seg>
            <seg id="p034">34 Nebraska Agricultural Exp. Station, Research Bui. 10 much heavier than on the check trees, and the number of apples which dropped prematurely much less. This was also noted by Emerson (1905). 2. The leaves are also attacked. In unsprayed orchards, the foliage is sometimes so severely injured that the fruit never attains salable size, and scarcely any growth is made by the trees. It often takes two or three years of thoro spraying to bring the trees back to normal growth and productiveness. 3. Scab also impairs the keeping qualities of fruit. At harvest time in 1915 several boxes of Winesap, Arkansas, and Ben Davis apples were sorted for exhibition, and for use in fruit judging. A part of each variety came from trees having considerable scabby fruit and a part from trees having no scab. All the fruit was free from visi - ble scab when packed. Some of the fruit was placed in cold storage and some in cellar storage. When the fruit was examined in Jan - uary, 1916, 10 per cent of the fruit in cold storage was scabby and 68 per cent of the fruit in cellar storage was scabby. The fruit in cold storage was held a few days before being stored and was taken out 2 days before being examined. Development of scab in storage was also reported from various growers in the State. Several of these reports were followed up, and the fruit was examined and found to have a high percentage of scab. In each case the growers stated that all scab was culled out at packing time. Scab in storage was also noted by Brooks (1908), Morse (1910), Morse and Lewis (1911), Wallace (1913), and Morris (1914). There is no longer any doubt that the entrance of several serious soft rot fungi is facilitated by scab. Craig and Van Hook (1902), Eustace (1902). Because of the continued loss by the growers, due to scab, notwithstanding the more or less thoro spraying, further investi - gation was decided upon to determine to what causes or condi - tions the lack of control was due. The general appearance of this disease is so well known that space will not be taken to discuss it here. 1905) Emerson. R. A. Apple Scab and Cedar Rust, Nebraska Bxp. Stm. Bui. 88:3.

            <seg id="p036">36 Nebraska Agricultural Exp. Station, Research Bui. 10 *^P Fig. 8 — A severe infection of scab on the fruit TIME OF INFECTION Apple scab is a cool weather disease and thrives best under conditions that allow shade and moisture. Under ordinary con - ditions the period of greatest infection is from the time the leaf buds begin to unfold until two or three weeks after the petals fall. That infection occurs before the blossoms open is shown by the fact that scab was found on a large number of leaves which had been enclosed in Manila paper bags before the blossoms were out. No record of the percentage of infection was secured, because the scab was not noticed until the bags were being exchanged for mosquito netting and by this time many of the clusters had been discarded. Wallace (1913) says "the first infection usually occurs when the blossoms are about to open or as soon thereafter as favorable weather conditions arise." Where there is an abundance of dead leaves under the trees, the period of infection may be prolonged by the continued develop - ment of perithecia in the leaves during a continued period of wet weather. Regarding the secondary or conidial infection, Wallace says: "The period of incubation may vary from eight to fifteen days; so that after this length of time has elapsed subsequent to the date of the earliest ascospore infection a crop of conidia is produced from which a second, and usually more abundant, infection may appear eight to fifteen days following the first period of weather favorable to infection that occurs after the above crop of spores has ripened. This generation may in turn produce another, and so on throughout the season. However, the various infections do not always occur only in successive jumps at intervals of eight to fifteen days, as the above discussion might lead one to believe. The crop of ascospores are not all matured and do not all dis - charge at one time. They begin to ripen at about the time indi - cated above and furnish a constant source of infection for a month or more. Thus the individual infections belonging to the first </seg>
            <seg id="p037">Spraying Experiments in Nebraska 37 generation may be started at several different dates and conse - quently produce their first crops of conidia at different dates. It is possible also that individual infections occurring at the same time do not all have the same period of incubation. Thus there may be a more or less constant appearance of scab, with the more pronounced jumps at intervals as indicated above. In fact this is what usually occurs. "The earliest infections usually occur on the lower side of the leaves. This is due to the fact that the lower side is more ex - posed at that time, while the leaves are unfolding. The later in - fections occur more abundantly on the upper surfaces, which by that time have assumed a more exposed position." During the cool, damp season of 1915 there was a great deal of loss due to secondary infection occurring from the latter part of July to the middle of August. To this late infection is attributed a large part of the loss in storage due to scab injury. It is quite possible that infection was taking place later than the middle of August. In fact the evidence indicates that infection was taking place just before the fruit was harvested, and that the storage scab resulted from this late infection, or, that it was caused, after harvesting, by infection from spores on the fruit at that time. The writer is of the opinion that infection occurred before picking, from the fact that some fruit heavily scabbed was stored in the same packages with clean fruit from an orchard free from scab, and when later removed for use, no scab appeared on the fruit from the clean orchard, altho the fruit was stored in the same cellar where so much infection was found. EXPERIMENTS IN 1913 After reviewing the work already done on the control of apple scab, and carefully going over the situation in Nebraska, it was determined to use fungicides in connection with the regular cod - ling moth and curculio sprays but to leave them out of some of the sprays on certain plats. Careful observations were made of the time and amount of infection. Records were kept of all scab injury, however small, and of the amount of spray injury for each schedule. No uniform time of infection was found in the different orchards. Florence was the only place where rainfall was normally abundant early in the spring, and at this place the primary infection was heavy. The secondary infection was not heavy any place in the State. </seg>

Therefore, the data are of little value except as a comparison of the value of Bordeaux and lime sulphur, and to show the value of a late spray. The results here indicate that there is practically no difference between the effectiveness of Bordeaux and lime sul - phur as a fungicide for scab. They also show that no benefit was derived from the spray following the second-brood codling moth application. However, the summer had been so dry that little effect could be expected. Bordeaux caused more injury at the second-brood application than did lime sulphur and con - siderably more at the later application.

Where Bordeaux was used for the second spray (plat 2) the effi - ciency was 95.4 per cent. Where Bordeaux was used for both applications (plat 4) the efficiency showed slightly less than in the case of either plat 1 or 2. The spray injury on this plat was so severe as to bar Bordeaux from use as a fungicide for the petal-fall spray. Plat 3 consisted of the variety Arkansas, alone. On this plat two applications proved to have a slightly higher efficiency in controlling scab than in any of the other plats, but here again the spray injury was very severe. The weather during and following the second application was very hot and dry and the burning was no doubt due to the rapid oxi - dation of some of the sulphur compounds in the spray. The variety Arkansas seemed to be especially susceptible to this injury. The foliage of all the plats where lime sulphur was used for the second application showed considerable burning, while the foliage on the Bordeaux plats was dark green and free from injury. The foliage was not injured on plat 4. This orchard had never been cultivated or sprayed.

Station, Research Bui. 10 Table 25 — Florence spray schedule The highest efficiency (96 per cent) secured at Florence (table 25) was in plat 5, where Bordeaux was used for the first spray and lime sulphur for the three subsequent sprays. Bor - deaux used for the first spray gave consistently better results than lime sulphur. For the subsequent sprays, however, Bor - deaux shows no added advantage. An idea of the approximate value of each application was secured by omitting one spray for each of the plats. The evidence secured in this way indicates that, at this place, the first spray controlled more than 32 per cent of the total infection. The petal-fall spray controlled 28 per cent, the 3-weeks spray controlled 16 per cent, and the July spray controlled 24 per cent. These figures are only approxi - mately correct, since it is impossible to determine how long a single application will be effective, but the results certainly show the relative value of the different applications for the one season.

            <seg id="p041">Spraying Experiments in Nebraska 41 The results here also indicate that, everything else being equal, the earlier in the season Bordeaux is used after the trees come into full bloom, the greater will be the danger of injury from spray burn. At Lincoln (table 26), the schedules for plats 1 and 2 gave approximately 100 per cent control. The complete lime sulphur schedule was 97 per cent efficient. Here again Bordeaux did con - siderable injury even where used only in July, but was especially injurious where used for the 3-weeks spray. The rainfall was certainly not more than normal at Lincoln in 1913, nor did it come at the most inopportune times, hence the weather cannot be largely to blame for the spray injury. These plats had been sprayed before but not cultivated. Lime sulphur injury was greater on the foliage than on the fruit. The results of the year's work indicate that a pre-petal-fall spray is often very necessary, depending upon weather condi - tions. Bordeaux seems to be more effective as a fungicide than lime sulphur, but when used for the petal-fall spray or soon after that time it russets the fruit so badly that its use is inadvisable. However, for the first application it proved more desirable than lime sulphur. EXPERIMENTS IN 1914 The same general plan of spraying was followed as in 1913 except that the dates of some of the sprays were shifted to cor - respond to the maturing and dissemination of the spores of the scab fungus.

In the orchards which had not been sprayed before, infection did not appear to a very noticeable extent until after the 10-days' spray had been applied.

            <seg id="p043">Spraying Experiments in Nebraska 43 Neither was there any appreciable difference in the amount of spray injury caused by the late sprays of either Bordeaux or lime sulphur. Practically all the infection which occurred here must have taken place about the time of the petal-fall spray as it began to be noticeable on the check trees soon after the 10-days spray. At Seward (table 28), the same conditions prevailed as at Beatrice. Here Bordeaux for the first spray showed a slightly higher efficiency than lime sulphur. The results of the year bear out those of 1913 in regard to the comparative efficiency of Bordeaux and lime sulphur. Bordeaux this year did little injury at any of the late sprayings, due to the excessively dry weather. In most instances, the petal-fall was the earliest spray that was necessary this year. EXPERIMENTS IN 1915 Since no conclusive results were obtained in 1914, owing to weather conditions, the same plans were followed in 1915. This season was very favorable to the development of scab and there was a great deal of primary as well as secondary infection. As in 1913, considerable infection occurred before the trees were in bloom. Quite a heavy secondary infection occurred from the latter part of July to the middle of August or perhaps considerably later. This secondary infection was heaviest near the check trees and in the vicinity of unsprayed orchards. In some cases more than 30 per cent of the fruit on well-sprayed trees in the vicinity of check trees was infected with small scab spots at packing time regardless of the fact that scarcely any of the windfalls from these "ABLE ewari spray sa Date Spray lat 1 2 April 30 May 20 June 18 Cluster-bud Petal-fall 3-weeks .

The difference in amount of infection on some of these plats and on the check might be astonishing were it not known that the check plat was a row near a fence which could not be cultivated, while all of the sprayed plats had received clean cultivation for several years. Unless the slight difference in the efficiency of the different schedules be attributed to the natural variation to be expected or to experimental error, the evidence indicates early infection. The spray injury is quite uniform for the different schedules except that of plat 1. The high percentage of spray injury recorded here cannot be accounted for. At Lincoln (table 31), the evidence corroborates that of table 29 at Beatrice. The late secondary infection on the sprayed trees was heavier here than at Beatrice, tho the infection on the check trees was much lighter. This difference may be due in part to the fact that unsprayed orchards were on all sides of the plats used in the experiment, but is due in part, no doubt, to more efficient spraying at Beatrice. The omission of a different application in each of several schedules furnishes evidence of when much of the infection occurred. It certainly proved disastrous, here, to omit the cluster-bud spray or the fungicide at the petal-fall spray as is often advocated. The control shown by the 14-days and the 21 - days applications indicates that considerable infection was also occurring at this time. </seg>

Evidently there was also considerable infection during the period between the 14-days and the 21-days spray. The fact that all the plats in table 32 are consistent in showing less scab infection than the corresponding plats shown in table 31 is conclusive evidence of a late secondary infection which occurred at such time that the August spray controlled it to a great extent. INCIDENTAL OBSERVATIONS During the past three seasons a number of observations were made which were not scheduled in the regular plans. In securing the records, it was noted that there was consider - able consistent variation in the amount of infection on different varieties of apples. This led to a study of all the available varie - ties, to determine which, if any, were resistant to scab. After three seasons of this work, it was found that the records of a vari - ety for one season did not always correspond with the records of the same variety for another season; e. g., the variety Winesap is usually considered much more susceptible than Ben Davis. The records bear this out for 1913 and 1914, but in 1915 scab was, in many instances, more prevalent on Ben Davis apples than on Winesap. On the average perhaps this is not true. It was also found that none of the common varieties are entirely free from scab, altho many varieties exhibit a great deal of resistance. On comparing observations made with the results previously reported by other workers, this variation in susceptibility is emphasized. Wallace (1913) makes a similar statement and quotes extracts from other publications. From the observations made in various orchards in the State and in the variety orchard at the Experiment Station the va - rieties have been tentatively grouped as follows: Practically resistant Moderately resistant Susceptible Wagner Jonathan Arkansas (Mammoth Oldenburg (Duchess) York (Imperial) Blacktwig) Wealthy Ben Davis Rails (Jenet) Patten Greening Windsor Northern Spy Gano Red June Grimes (Golden) Virginia Beauty Missouri (Pippin) Yellow Transparent Salome Sheriff Champion Maiden Blush Minkler Walbridge 1913) Wallace, Emit.

Station, Research Bui. 10 Practically resistant Moderately resistant Susceptible Northwest Greening Early Harvest Rome Beauty Fameuse (Snow) Delicious King David Red Astrachan Chenango Wolf River Paragon Malinda Willow Twig Stayman Winesap Chicago Utter (Red) Scab was always found to be more prevalent where no cultiva - tion was practiced and decidedly less in evidence where thoro, early and late cultivation was practiced as in the case of the Beavers orchard at Omaha. Well pruned and spaced trees were as a rule less scabby than trees which carried a dense foliage or which were so close together that the branches interlocked. This should be expected, since the more dense the foliage the longer the tree will remain moist and afford the best conditions for the germination of spores. It was noticed that trees situated on high, rolling land were usually not so badly infected as trees on lower ground. This is due in part to the better circulation of air on the rolling land and in part to the dense foliage found on trees growing in low places, especially where proper pruning is not given. Si: M MARY The foregoing records and observations lead to some more or less general conclusions. Sanitation, i.e., the removal of old leaves, windfalls, and mum - mied apples, together with clean culture, will go a long way to - wards controlling the primary infection. The proper spacing of the trees in an orchard, together with good air drainage and the right amount of pruning, will lessen the infection to some extent. However, even with an ideal orchard and the best methods of sanitation, clean fruit cannot be grown in Nebraska unless the orchards are properly sprayed. The evidence presented shows that spraying will control the disease if applied at the proper time and that this time depends upon the time of infection. The spray must be applied before the infection in order to prevent injury. Therefore, since it has been proved that there is always more or less infection at or just before the time the blossoms are out if the weather conditions are favorable, it follows that spraying for scab must be done before </seg>
            <seg id="p051">Spraying Experiments in Nebraska 51 this time. What is known as the cluster-bud stage, just as the flowers of the clusters are separating and showing "pink" but before the individual blossoms open, is the proper time for this application, according to results obtained. In dry seasons or in orchards where thoro spraying and orchard sanitation have been the rule, this application may be omitted without serious loss as shown by the results obtained in most of the orchards in 1914 and in the Omaha orchard (table 30) in 1915. A second application at the petal-fall stage, and another two to three weeks later, are as a rule required to insure protection. During this time new surfaces of fruit and foliage are being rap - idly exposed and are liable to infection. Another spray in the latter part of July or the first part of August may be necessary to prevent late infection in wet seasons such as that of 1915. In order to secure the best results, it is necessary that the grower watch the weather conditions carefully and regulate his schedule accordingly. Thousands of bushels of apples have been lost in this State because the grower delayed spraying on account of rainy weather, fearing the spray would wash off. This is just the time when protection is needed to prevent infection. There is rarely a season in Nebraska when, because of wet weather, there is not sufficient time to spray, and if it is possible to work for only a part of a day at a time, spraying should proceed. Ordinarily the spray material will dry in 30 minutes of sunshine so that it will adhere well thru any ordinary hard washing rain. APPLE BLOTCH Spraying experiments were begun in 1913, primarily to de - termine efficient methods of control for codling moth, plum curculio, and apple scab, but it was soon discovered that apple blotch was more destructive in some parts of the state than apple scab. The disease was carefully observed during the season and notes taken on the efficiency of the sprays, intended for scab, in controlling blotch. This disease has only recently invaded Nebraska from the south and east and as yet is serious only in the southeastern portion of the State. It is widely distributed over the United States. The writer had abundant opportunity to observe its destructiveness in Kansas in 1910, '11, and '12, where in some sections it causes more damage than any other disease which attacks the apple. DESCRIPTION AND BEHAVIOR The fungus attacks fruit spurs, twigs, and rapidly growing shoots, producing characteristic cankers (Scott and Rorer, 1909). (1909) Scott, W. P. and Rorer, Junes B.

            <seg id="p052">Nebraska Agricultural Exp. Station, Research Bui. 10 52 Scott and Rorer further say, in effect: On the fruiting branches the cankers appear first as small purple or blackish blotches. As they increase in size they become brown in the center with a purple margin but finally become gray. % The bark soon cracks around the cankers, especially along the lateral edges. On rapidly grow - ing shoots, particularly water sprouts, the cankers have the same t 4^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^V^B^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^P^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^H^Mh general appearance as on fruiting branches, but are much larger, often measuring an inch or more in length and sometimes girdling the stem. The fungus lives over winter in the cankers, which be - come larger from year to year and may continue to grow for several seasons. Frequently, however, the cankers are cut off from the healthy tissue by cracks, dry up, and later the wound may heal over. The cankers themselves do not, as a rule, seriously injure the tree, but in some cases, on susceptible varieties, such as North - west Greening, Missouri, Limber Twig, and Red Astrachan, the trees may become so badly affected that much of the bearing wood will be killed and the trees materially weakened. The leaves also are attacked, the fungus causing irregular light brown, yellowish, or whitish spots, measuring ' ,„ inch or less in diameter. The spots often appear in great numbers scattered promiscuously over the surface of the leaf, on the veins, midrib, and petiole. The Fig. 9 — Tilotch cankers on twig3 </seg>
            <seg id="p053">Spraying Experiments in Nebraska 53 badly infected leaves may turn yellow and drop prematurely, or die, turn brown, and remain on the tree. This results in a weaken - ing and in many cases the death of the fruit buds for the following year's crop. M J I il HP Fig. 10 — Blotch on young fruit Fig. 11 — Blotch on mature fruit "The first evidence of the disease on the fruit is a very small, inconspicuous light brown blot which under a hand lens has the appearance of a stellate collection of brown fibers just beneath the epidermis." The blotch spreads rapidly until it attains a size of from one - eighth to three-eights of an inch or even larger and becomes 1+ &amp; &amp; </seg>
            <seg id="p054">54 Nebraska Agricultural Exp. Station, Research Bui. 10 darker in color. The advancing margin is irregular and jagged and has a fringed appearance. Where the spots are numerous they often coalesce and form large blotches which may cover half or more of the fruit. The fungus kills only the superficial cells so that the continued growth of the tissue beneath results in a crack - ing of the diseased areas. These cracks tho usually small may girdle the fruit and extend to the core. The general effect is to mar the appearance of the fruit and render it unfit for packing. INFECTION According to Scott and Rorer the cankers in which the fungus passes the winter are the chief source of infection. Spores are produced during the warm, moist weather of spring, which are readily carried by the rain and other agencies to the young fruit, leaves, and twigs, producing the first spring outbreak of the dis - ease. The primary and most extensive infection begins 4 to 5 weeks after the petals have fallen, altho some infection probably occurs during the remainder of the growing season. EXPERIMENTS IN 1913 No special attention was given to blotch when the schedules for 1913 were outlined, but notes were taken on time and amounts of infection and the degree of control afforded by each schedule. Table 33 — Wymore spray schedule Date April 21 May 5 May 22 July 2 Spray Cluster-bud Petal-fall Three-weeks I Second-brood At Wymore (table 33), the efficiency of the lime sulphur schedule (plat 3) was only 23 per cent, while that of the Bordeaux schedule (plat 1) was 99 per cent, and of plat 2 was 97 per cent.

            <seg id="p055">Spraying Experiments in Nebraska 55 after the falling of the petals prevented most of the infection. The fact that the Bordeaux spray applied July 2 was slightly more efficient than lime sulphur applied at the same time indicates that some infection occurred after that date. The first blotch spots were found on the fruit on July 3, about 7 weeks after the petals had fallen from the trees. This would indicate that the infection occurred not more than 4 weeks after the petals fell. Table 34 — Brownville spray schedule At Brownville (table 34), the evidence indicates that the three - weeks spray controlled the greater part of the infection. Bordeaux used at this time was 31.8 per cent more efficient than lime sulphur. Bordeaux used for the petal-fall spray showed no advantage over lime sulphur, but on the other hand greatly injured a high per cent of the crop. The indications are that the heavy infection occurred soon after the three-weeks spray and that some infection occurred later in the season. EXPERIMENTS IN 1914 Special stress was laid on determining the date and length of the infection period as well as methods of control. Observations were made in an unsprayed orchard near Lincoln and in the orchards where spraying was done. Spores were found issuing from the cankers in large numbers on June 5 at Beatrice and Wymore and on June 8 at Lincoln. Spores may have been freed before this time. As blotch cankers were not plentiful at Beatrice or Wymore it was impossible to secure definite data at these places. At Date May 6 May 30 Spray Petal-fall Three-weeks .

The spray schedules were so arranged that plats could be sprayed at inter - vals of about 10 days during the heavy dissemination of spores. The severe injury due to Bordeaux russeting, together with the fact that Bordeaux proved more efficient than lime sulphur, led to an interchange of Bordeaux and lime sulphur applications in some of the schedules in order to ascertain if it were not possible to con - trol blotch with a minimum amount of injury.

            <seg id="p057">Spraying Experiments in Nebraska 57 At Beatrice (table 35), Bordeaux proved only 11 per cent more efficient than lime sulphur. Since the 35-days spray pre - vented practically as much injury as either of the two preceding sprays, it would indicate that most of the infection did not take place until or after this time. Table 36— Wymore spray schedule Date April 23 May 14 June 10 July 12 Spray ! Cluster-bud Petal-fall Three-weeks Second-brood At Wymore (table 36), Bordeaux again proved superior to lime sulphur in controlling blotch. There was considerable more blotch injury on the lime sulphur plat than on the check plat. The check plat was sprayed four times with Bordeaux in 1913. This may account for the lack of infection in 1914. The results of the work in 1914, while not conclusive, shed considerable light on the possibility, and methods, of controlling blotch. Considering the time when the first spores were liberated, if the proper weather conditions exist infection should begin about three weeks after the petals fall. The finding of some blotched fruit on July 8 at Lincoln and July 10 at Beatrice would also indicate that infection may occur earlier than was suggested by Scott and Rorer. Lewis (1913) also suggested that this was the case in Kansas. However, the fact that the 35-days spray was almost as efficient in controlling the disease as the 10-days or the 25-days spray shows that most of the infection occurred not sooner than 5 weeks after the petals had fallen. As in 1913, Bordeaux proved more efficient than lime sulphur.

In this case, however, the 21-days spray shows an efficiency of 100 per cent and practically as much ii shown for the 85-days spray, but the 14-days spray permitted some infection. The writer is of the opinion that infection did not take place until after the 14-days spray, and the Bordeaux, being effective for a longer period than lime sulphur, prevented infection. It is very probable that some infection occurred on plat 4 before the spray was put on.

            <seg id="p061">Spraying Experiments in Nebraska 61 INCIDENTAL OBSERVATIONS At Brownville in 1913, considerable summer pruning was done on plat 3. This consisted in the removal of dead and dis - eased wood and a general thinning out of the tops of the trees. At this time all blotch cankers which could be found were re - moved. To no other reason can be ascribed the difference in amount of blotch on plats 2 and 3. This difference, while not extraordinary, indicates what may be accomplished in this way. The greatest amount of infection seems to occur from about 3 to 5 weeks after the petals fall. The exact time between these two dates depends upon weather conditions. Infection occurs more readily and abundantly if the weather is warm and moist. Blotch attacks fruit spurs as well as small branches and water sprouts. At the Hartley orchard, north of Lincoln, an exami - nation of a number of Mann apple trees revealed the fact that on two of these which were infected the worst, 20 per cent of the spurs were dead and on the remaining spurs more than 30 per cent of the buds were killed. This mortality could be attributed only to blotch injury, since the trees were otherwise in a good state of health. Grouped according to susceptibility as observed during the last three seasons, the common varieties rank as follows: Practically resistant Moderately resistant Grimes (Golden) Lawver Susceptible Mann York (Imperial) Rails (Jenet) Winesap M inkier Missouri (Pippin) Maiden Blush Stayman Rome Northwest Greening Wealthy Arkansas (Mammoth Ben Davis Blacktwig) Arkansas Black This list is very short, owing to the lack of varieties in the orchards under observation. As in the case of resistance to scab, there was some variation of the comparative resistance of the different varieties. NUMMARY The results of experiments and observations during the past three seasons indicate that apple blotch on the fruit can be con - trolled entirely by spraying alone, but the eradication of the dis - ease may be facilitated by supplementing a thoro spraying cam - paign with the pruning out of affected wood. Bordeaux was found more effective than lime sulphur, but at the same time it was found to cause considerable injury to the fruit by russeting it. The injury was found to be greatest when Bordeaux was used at or soon after the time when the petals fall. </seg>

When the mixture is properly made, the injury from Bordeaux compared with the advantage* of iu um, in combating blotch, Is to small that in badly infected orchard* it it recommended for the 8-weeks apruy and nubnequent upiilirutionx. For this purpose the 8 4 60 formula is recommended, tho if a good grade of fresh stone lime is used (not air-slacked or hydrated lime) the 8 3 60 formula is equally good. During dry weather the 4 4 60 formula has given good results but is not so safe when used during wet weather. The indications are that three weeks after the petals fall is soon enough for the first spray for blotch, and in orchards no more badly infected than were those in which the records were made, i.e., 12 per cent to 46 per cent, this spray, followed by another application of fungicide when spraying for the second brood of codling moth, is usually sufficient. In orchards more heavily infected, no doubt another application of Bordeaux, 16 to 20 days after the S-weeks spray, would prove very beneficial. C1DAR RUST ON APPLES During the three seasons just past, sufficient data could not be secured to warrant any statements by the writer on methods of controlling this disease. The comparatively dry seasons pre - ceding these experiments probably aid not offer the best con - ditions for the advancement of the disease. A report published Fig. 12— Cedar ruit on fruit </seg>

The fungus attacks the fruit late in the season and is entirely superficial, the loss being due to discoloration, reducing the salability of the fruit. The fungus is most abundant during wet seasons and does the most damage to fruit in the lower parts of the orchard where air drainage is poor or where the trees stand too close together.or are not properly pruned. Fig. 14 — Sooty blotch or flyspeck on fruit Observations indicate that with proper pruning to admit air and light the disease will be incidentally controlled in spraying for blotch and scab. BORDEAUX VS. LIME SULPHUR Bordeaux has long been considered as the specific for all fungous diseases and has upheld its reputation in so far as con - trolling diseases is concerned. However, a great deal of injury to fruit and foliage often accompanies its use. In searching for a substitute, lime sulphur was found to be the most satisfactory material as a fungicide. Its fungicidal properties may not be quite so pronounced as those of Bordeaux, but the small amount of injury accompanying its judicial use, together with its insec - ticidal value, often makes it more desirable than Bordeaux. Experiments were begun at this Station to determine the rela - tive value of each for general spraying purposes. The three seasons during which the tests were carried on offer ample varia - tions in weather conditions to permit of rather general conclu - sions as to the value of each and the conditions which encourage injury from the use of either. </seg>
            <seg id="p065">Spraying Experiments in Nebraska 65 EXPERIMENTS IN 1913 In addition to the data on this subject given in connection with scab and blotch control, data were taken as to the effect of Bordeaux and lime sulphur on insects and diseases in general as well as to the amount of sound, clean fruit resulting from the use of either material. In making Bordeaux, the orthodox method of mixing was followed, i. e., the diluted lime and copper sulphate were poured simultaneously into a mixing tank or into the spray tank. A high grade of lime was used and all coarse material, grit, etc., removed by straining.

There was practically no difference in the amount of spray injury. The lack of Bordeaux injury on the fruit is no doubt due to the fact that dry weather followed the applications. Bordeaux injury to the foliage was quite noticeable. This was also true of lime sulphur injury.

At Lincoln (table 42), the results were practically the same as at Florence. Bordeaux made according to the 4-4-50 formula was no more effective than the 3-4-50 Bordeaux. Neither did it cause any more injury; in fact the injury on this plat was less than in plat 1. There was one tree in plat 1 which had much more injury than any other tree of either plat. There was more codling moth injury on the Bordeaux plats than on the lime sulphur plats. This difference is attributed to some extent to the greater amount of spray injury found on the former. The damage was done chiefly by second-brood larvae which entered thru the roughened parts of the skin, these places affording an easier entrance than the smooth, hard surface of the unrusseted portions. Again, there might have been a less thoro covering of poison over this part of the apple, due to the malforma - tion of the fruit after the spraying was done. Considerable injury to foliage also occurred on the Bordeaux plats.

The varieties Early Harvest, Rails, Rome, Chenango, Snow, Missouri, York, and Maiden Blush are perhaps less seriously injured than are the other well-known varieties of apples, but since they are also less important the question of varietal susceptibility can be given little consideration in attempting to eliminate the trouble. Bordeaux injury first appears on the fruit as small dark-colored spots regular in outline and occurring singly or in long clusters. Usually injury occurs on the upper side of the fruit but not un - commonly almost the entire surface is covered. Soon after the spots are first noticed the skins become roughened. Small ridges or veins connect the different spots so that the skin presents a corky, netted appearance. In cases of severe injury, the apples Fig. 15 — A light case of Bordeaux injury on fruit Fig. 16 — A severe cue of Bordeaux injury on fruit </seg>
            <seg id="p073">Spraying Experiments in Nebraska 73 are often distorted in shape. The growth of the cuticle is checked , while the inner tissues continue to grow. This causes the apple to become lopsided, and often causes cracking similar to that caused by scab and blotch. On the leaves, Bordeaux injury resembles to some extent the injury caused by some fungi. Brown spots of dead tissue 3 or 4 mm. in diameter appear, at first regular, but as the spots increase in size and coalesce, becoming quite irregular. In cases of severe injury, these spots involve one-third to one-half of the area of the leaf, or more. Soon the remaining portions become yellow, then begin to wither and turn brown, until only the midrib and larger veins remain green; then these succumb and the leaves fall. Sometimes the leaves fall before turning brown. The number of leaves affected varies from a few, scattered over the tree, to almost all the leaves on the tree. Bordeaux injury usually does not occur for several days after the application and if no rain falls may not occur at all. However, as a rule, enough dew collects to cause some injury even in dry weather. On the foliage the injury was found to be more sever* when the leaves had been injured by insects, hail, or other causes. This was also true of the fruit after a hailstorm at Florence. Lime used in excess does not prevent or lessen to any appre - ciable extent the injury from Bordeaux russeting. Neither is the application of milk of lime to the trees after Bordeaux has been applied of any appreciable benefit, as shown by table 47. Lime sulphur causes some injury to both fruit and foliage; but, unlike the injury caused by Bordeaux, it appears almost at once. It causes the most severe injury during hot dry weather. This is no doubt due to the oxidation of the tissues. On the fruit, lime sulphur injury, when not severe, resembles injury caused by Bordeaux, but in more severe cases the injured surface becomes hard and thickened. Unlike the netted appear - ance formed in Bordeaux injury, the surface is covered by more or less smooth and dark-colored scales, giving the fruit a scurfy ap - pearance. In the most severe cases, cracks appear on the injured surface, usually near the edges but often crisscrossing the entire surface. This injury is no doubt partly due to sun scald before or during the time when the oxidation of the tissues is taking place. That this must be the case is shown by the fact that the most severe injury is always found on the south and west sides of the trees. The injury before spraying or as it appears on unsprayed trees was much less severe and of a different appearance. Sun scald alone appears first as a brownish discolored spot with a fairly distinct margin. Later, in the most severe cases, the skin becomes sunken and remains smooth and dark. Very little cracking </seg>

            <seg id="p075">Spraying Experiments in Nebraska 75 occurs except at the margin of the injured spot. On the sprayed fruit a much larger area is usually affected. Cracking is more pronounced and scales and rays of russet extend far beyond the limits of the sunken corky spots. Often the most severe injury did not appear for several days after spraying, or until a period of very hot, dry weather and bright sunshine. However, in such cases the injury was rarely so severe as when the spraying was done during a period of ex - tremely hot, dry weather. Bonns (1912) says that the spray affects only that portion of the fruit which has already been injured by sun scald. Fig. 17 — Lime sulphur injury on fruit On the foliage, lime sulphur injury appears within the first 12 to 24 hours after applying the spray. The tender new leaves are the first to suffer but in more severe cases the mature leaves are also damaged. The injury appears first at the tips and edges, where the material collects in larger quantities, and gradually ex - tends toward the center of the leaf. Dead, brown spots may also appear over the entire leaf. The general appearance is as tho the leaves had been scorched by fire. Lime sulphur containing sludge causes more severe burning than where the clear liquid is used. This was demonstrated in a near-by orchard where lime sulphur containing sludge was used on a part of the orchard while the remainder was sprayed with the clear liquid. Both leaves and fruit were damaged where the sludge was used. 1912) Bonns, W. W. Orchard spraying experiments. Maine Sta. Bui. 198:21. </seg>

It is the opinion of the writer that a great deal of the so-called spray injury to the leaves is due to infection by fungous diseases. It was noticed that either Bordeaux and lime sulphur injury was as a rule more conspicuous in the orchards where there was an infection of blotch. This was also true of lime sulphur in 1915 in the orchards where the scab infection was most severe. The spray when applied where infection has occurred finds a ready entrance into the leaves at the infected parts and consequently destroys the contents of the surrounding cells, causing the well-known spotting. This has also been noted consistently in other orchards, the spray injury in the form of spotting of the leaves occurring more abundantly in orchards infected with blotch or scab and appearing in greater numbers after the last spray of the summer. Hedriek (1907) states that the scab fungus often causes a russet closely resembling spray injury to appear on apples and pears. He also mentions the resemblance of Bordeaux injury on the foliage to the injury caused by species of Phyllosticta. Stewart and Eustace (1902) found that the spots caused by Bordeaux injury were free from the pycnidia or Phyllosticta in early summer, July 10, but that later the majority of the spots contained a species of Phyllosticta, but they raise the question as to whether the fungus does not appear as a saprophyte after the Bordeaux has caused the injury. As a rule, even where russeting is negligible, fruit sprayed with Bordeaux is not so bright colored and attractive as fruit sprayed with lime sulphur. Tiny gray flecks are scattered over the surface, marring the otherwise smooth, waxy appearance. This condition, however, is not so noticeable where Bordeaux is used during the latter part of the season and is not followed by rain. SUMMARY The results of the three years' work with Bordeaux and lime sulphur indicate that Bordeaux is very little if any more effective than lime sulphur as a fungicide under Nebraska conditions, ex - cept in the control of apple blotch. The danger of injuring the fruit which accompanies the use of Bordeaux makes its use inadvisable except where serious infections of blotch occur. (1907) Hedriek, U. P. Bordeaux injury.

            <seg id="p077">Spraying Experiments in Nebraska 77 Bordeaux injury is most severe during wet weather and on young fruit. Lime sulphur injury is most severe during dry weather. The 3-3-50 Bordeaux has proven as efficient for spraying apples as any other formula. Bordeaux injury cannot be materially reduced by using an excess of lime or by applying lime after spraying with Bordeaux. HOME BOILED VS. COMMERCIAL LIME SULPHUR The comparatively high cost of commercial lime sulphur has induced a number of growers to attempt to manufacture their own solution. Such varying degrees of success have accompanied these efforts that it was decided to conduct a series of tests to determine the relative value of the two solutions. Only one year's work is reported.

Slightly less spray burn was recorded for the plats sprayed with the home boiled solution. If spray injury is due to the rapid oxidation of the sulphur com - pounds, this might be expected, since of the total sulphur content of the home boiled solution approximately 62.5 per cent was polysulphides, (CaS» and CaS&lt;), while the polysulphides in the commercial solution amounted to approximately 75.4 per cent of the entire sulphur content. The results shown in tables 31 and 32 are for home boiled lime sulphur. COMMERCIAL PREPARATIONS SOLD AS FUNGICIDES Several preparations, sold as fungicides by various companies, have been tried out, but so far nothing has been found to take the place of the two standard fungicides. Several brands of prepared Bordeaux were found to control fungous diseases practically as well as the regular Bordeaux but did considerably more damage to fruit and foliage. Atomic sulphur and soluble sulphur were used with the re - sults that scab was usually controlled but the damage to fruit and foliage was so great as to make the use of either disastrous. Sulphur in either form would be desirable because of convenience in handling and reduction in freight, could the disagreeable feature of injury to the fruit be eliminated. PENETRATION VS. MIST SPRAYING There has been so much discussion in regard to the manner of applying spray materials, so many arguments advanced favoring both high and low pressure solid-stream and hollow-stream noz - zles, etc., etc., that it is difficult to determine which method or combination of methods to follow. Unfortunately for the man who studies bulletins from every station, hoping thereby to model his own course of procedure, there is such a wide range of climatic and other conditions that what is true for one section of the country will not obtain for another. Especially is this true in attempting to compare eastern and western methods of fruit growing. And, while the penetration method of spraying, i.e., applying the liquid with solid-stream nozzles under high pressure, gives good results under Washington conditions, it does not necessarily follow that it will give equally good results under such conditions as obtain in the Middle West. The foregoing report on codling moth control shows that the spray applied as a coarse mist under 225 to 250 pounds pressure is as effective for the calyx application as where applied with the </seg>

            <seg id="p083">Spraying Experiments in Nebraska 83 amount of spray injury caused by this method. Plat 1 was sprayed with mist nozzles at each application and plat 2 with Bordeaux nozzles. SUMMARY The evidence presented by the data on codling moth control and that shown in the foregoing tables indicate that more injury is done by using solid-stream nozzles than by using those of the hollow-stream type, while there is practically no more efficiency secured. Even for the petal-fall spray nothing is gained by using the Bordeaux type of nozzle. The filling of all calyx cups and the thoro covering of all parts of the tree, fruit, and foliage with the least expenditure of labor and material and with a minimum amount of injury to the fruit constitutes efficiency in spraying. Coarse mist nozzles operating under 225 to 250 pounds pressure will throw a penetrating heavy mist several feet thru the foliage of an ordinary tree and will fill the calyx cups as readily and cover all parts of the foliage more evenly and thoroly than will the Bordeaux type of nozzle. To prevent injury, the material should be applied evenly, so that the liquid will not collect in large drops or run off. There is less danger of missing any part of the tree, and the fruit is not so liable to be russeted by the hard particles in the spray, when ap - plied in this way. The relative costs of the two methods of spraying will be dis - cussed later. CUMULATIVE EFFECTS OF SPRAYING The argument is often advanced that it does not pay to spray when a crop is not expected or when the insect infestation or the fungous infection is light. This is a fallacy. The orchardist cannot afford to neglect spraying just because there is no promise of immediate returns. Spraying will more than pay expenses in the benefit to the following year's crop. At Florence in 1913 only a part of a 30-acre orchard was sprayed. The whole orchard was sprayed in 1914 and 1915, but at harvest time in 1915 the effect of the thoro spraying received by but a part of the trees in 1913 was still decidedly noticeable. The effects were so evident that the packers, who were not acquainted with the facts of the case, found a decided difference in the grades of fruit from the two parts of the orchard. The following tables also indicate that the cumulative effects make spraying decidedly worth while even in an "off year." </seg>
            <seg id="p084">Nebraska Agricultural Exp. Station, Research Bui. 10 84 Both plats in table 55 were sprayed in 1915, but only plat 1 received any spray in 1914. The plats were only two rows apart in the same orchard. In recording fungous injury, 210 per cent was secured by adding together the apples affected by scab, blotch, and sooty blotch. The foregoing data, while not exhaustive, serve to indicate the importance of continued effort in insect and disease control. At Omaha (table 56), neither plat was sprayed in 1915, the year in which the data were taken. Plat 1 was sprayed for five consecutive years prior to 1915. Plat 2 has never been sprayed. The plats were situated one-half mile apart. COST OF SPRAYING Accurate accounts were kept of all labor and materials used in spraying thruout the three seasons' work. In computing costs of spraying, averages were made for each type of machine, for all Bordeaux schedules, for lime sulphur schedules, and for the mist and penetration schedules. In computing the cost of lime sulphur the 1J-2-50 formula was used, the cost of poison being included . In computing the cost of Bordeaux and arsenate of lead the 3-4-2-50 formula was used.

Machines of this capacity are efficient for 1,000 to 2,000 trees. Efficient service cannot be secured where the capacity of the machine is too small to spray the orchard in five or six full days of good weather. The capacity of the machine needed may be de - termined by the length of time the calyx cups remain open. This is usually 7 to 10 days. A single machine may be used to spray more than this if the varieties are so arranged that one part of the orchard comes into bloom later than another; but with our standard varieties of apples, not more than two or three days can be gained in this way. It is little wonder that the fruit grower who sprays (?) 50 to 100 acres of orchard with one machine fails to get results. The cost of spraying with lime sulphur is shown in table 58. This table also shows the comparative cost of the mist and the penetration methods of spraying. The penetration method is more expensive from the fact that more time is consumed in apply - ing the spray and for the reason that more material is used. That this excess is wasted is shown by the fact that the efficiency was no higher than when the spray was applied as a mist. This superfluous amount of material may account for a part of the excessive spray injury caused by the penetration method of spraying. </seg>
            <seg id="p092">92 Nebraska Agricultural Exp. Station, Research Bui. 10 Table 59 shows the cost of spraying with Bordeaux as well as a comparison of the mist and penetration methods of spraying. Little difference is shown between the actual cost of spraying with Bordeaux and with lime sulphur as indicated by the tables. The cost of material for the former is somewhat less; but the ad - ditional labor of making it brings the cost up equal to that of lime sulphur. RESULTS OF SPRAYING BASED ON COMMERCIAL RETURNS It is impossible to make a fair comparison of commercial re - turns from spraying in widely separated orchards, in the treat - ment of which the only thing in common is spraying. For instance, the percentage of fruit free from insect or fungous injury may be higher in a sod orchard than in an orchard under cultivation, but when the fruit is graded the returns from the cultivated orchards are larger because the individual apples are larger. Again, a well-pruned orchard may show higher returns when the fruit is graded than an unpruned orchard in spite of the fact that the number of sound apples in the latter is much greater. As in the first instance, the size of the individual apples is the determining factor. In table 59, commercial grades of the sprayed plats are compared with commercial grades from check trees in the same orchard. No attempt is made to compare the results from the different orchards. </seg>

            <seg id="p094">94 Nebraska Agricultural Exp. Station, Research Bui. 10 In computing the value, the actual selling price of the fruit was taken. The culls were not considered since they were not sold. The net gain per tree from spraying these plats may be found as follows: The above yields no doubt appear high, and would be high were we considering the average of the whole orchard, but it must be remembered that the trees under observation were chosen because of their uniformly good state of health, shape, size, and fruitfulness. Considering all the trees in the various orchards, the net gain per tree on the sprayed portions was approximately one-half the amount shown above. GENERAL SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS Three sprays are required during a normal season to control an ordinary infestation of codling moth. The first spray should be applied immediately after two-thirds to three-fourths of the petals have fallen. The spray should be applied as a coarse mist, directly against the face of the open calyces. In order to apply the spray properly the greater part of the spraying should Plat 1— Total value of fruit Value of fruit on check plat .

            <seg id="p095">Spraying Experiments in Nebraska 95 be done from the tower. A good arrangement, where the trees are large, if a large capacity machine is used, is for two men to work from the tower and one from the ground. The material should be applied downward with a stroking motion of the rod, beginning at the extreme tip of the branches and following down to the trunk. In this way there is a mimimum danger of missing any of the calyces. More material is needed for this application than for any other. The pressure should be 225 to 250 pounds. The next spray should be applied about three weeks later and should consist of a fine mist. The paramount object of this application is to cover thoroly all growing parts of the tree. The material should be directed both above and below with long stroking motions, beginning at the tips of the branches. The exact time for applying this spray is immediately after the moths begin to deposit their eggs, and may be determined as indicated on page 12. The third spray for codling moth should be applied immedi - ately after the eggs, from which the second-brood larvae hatch, are laid and should be applied in the same manner as the preceding spray. In abnormal seasons, like that of 1914, when owing to favor - able conditions the moths emerge early and multiply rapidly, a third-brood spray is necessary. Practically no difference was found in the effectiveness of any of the standard brands of arsenate of lead. Two pounds of arsenate of lead "paste" or 1$ pounds of arsenate of lead powder has been found to be as efficient as more. In spraying for the control of the plum curculio, the work must be done early in the season. It was found necessary to apply one spray before the flowers open. The time for the remaining sprays corresponds so closely to the first two codling moth sprays that the schedule for that insect may be adopted. It has been shown, however, that a spray as late as the second-brood codling moth application is as a rule of little value in controlling the curculio. In an average season, in orchards where clean culture and thoro spraying have not greatly reduced the infection three sprays are necessary to control the primary infection of apple scab. The first spray should be applied before the blossoms open and may be combined with the first spray for plum curculio. The next two sprays correspond so closely with the first and second sprays for codling moth, and the second and third for curculio that the poison and fungicides may be combined. In case of a heavy secondary infection, such as occurred in 1915, a later spray, corresponding so closely to the time of the second-brood codling moth application that it may be combined with it, is necessary. </seg>

            <seg id="p098">98 Nebraska Agricultural Exp. Station, Research Bui. 10 the complete closing of the calyces is usually seven to ten days. It is not safe to attempt to spray more trees than can be covered in five or six full days with one machine. Power machines are the most satisfactory where the orchard is large enough to warrant their use, tho not necessarily more efficient than a good type of hand pump outfit when the latter is properly used. With any outfit the nozzle capacity must be regulated to fit the capacity of the pump. No outfit will do good work when the pump is unable to supply the liquid fast enough to maintain a good pressure. It makes little difference whether a double act - ing horizontal pump or an upright duplex or triplex pump is used if the capacity is large enough and it is well made, provided plenty of power is supplied to operate it at full capacity and the outfit is not too heavy. The outfit shown in fig. 21 is of the horizontal type and the one shown in figs. 23 and 24 belongs to the upright plunger type. However excellent in all other ways, an outfit is not dependable unless it has a good pressure regulator. One of the best pressure regulators is shown in detail in fig. 25. It must be remembered that efficiency in spraying is secured only by doing the work thoroly and at a time that will prevent infestation and infection. Protection by spraying is preventive rather than curative. A spray applied at the wrong time is little better than no spray. Spraying in a half-hearted way is often worse than no spray. It costs money but does no good. It is cheaper to buy efficient machines than to "kill time tinkering" with a poor machine. 10-24-'16 — 4 M </seg>
