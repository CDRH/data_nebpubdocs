            <seg id="p017">GAME AND FISH COMMISSION 17 ARRESTS, SEIZURES AND CONVICTIONS. During the last biennium the Commission has caused the arrest of 303 persons charged with violations of the Game and fish laws; 250 of these were convicted and paid fines, in some cases jail sentences were inflicted. The total fines imposed and paid to the various county treas - urers amounted to $2,484.17. The number of unlawful fishing nets confiscated and destroyed during the past two years were 213. There were 302 fish traps destroyed. A great many lines, having more than the legal number of hooks thereon, have also been destroyed. All fish and game confiscated have been given either to State Institutions or poor people. There were no seine license's issued during the past biennium. The department has found it difficult to get the cooperation of County Attorneys and Judges. In many cases they are very lenient in imposing lines and in some cases it was impossible to get any action. The officers of this department have at all times endeavored to do their duty and have at no time insisted upon heavy fines for first offense. We have had the cooperation of many portsmen in the state and also the special deputies have done good work. RECOMMENDATIONS. I wish to recommend that the salary of deputy game wardens be raised. The department now employs three deputy wardens on a salary of seventy-five dollars per month not to exceed eight months of the year, thus leaving the department without help for four months. During the past biennium this department has turned Into the state school fund over seventy-three thousand dollars for the sale of hunting licenses. This is nearly forty thousand dollars more than the appropriation given the department for the past two years. In view of this fact I do not feel that it would be unreasonable to increase the salary of the deputies to one hundred dollars per month for twelve months, with an increase in traveling expense from three hundred dollars a year to five hundred. In conclusion, I wish to express my gratitude to the sportsmen and Rod and Gun clubs of the State, that have interested themselves in this department; also the special deputies, through whose efforts a number of prosecutions have been made. I wish also to thank the press of the state for courtesies extended. Very respectfully. GUST, RUTENBECK, Chief Deputy Commissioner, CONCLUSION. </seg>

VALENTINE SCB-STATION. Owing to torrential rains which fell in the vicinity of Valentine in June. 1915, about $2,000 damage was done to this hatchery and a large part of the past eighteen months has been required to repair this dam - age and prevent a recurrence in the future. While the state suffered some property loss, it was small as compared with the loss sustained by the Gilman power dam going out and the loss in bridges to Cherry County. The two lower bass ponds in the canyon were washed out with thousands of young and also the adult Bass; these were carried into the Xiobarra River and will assist in stocking the sloughs, and lakes, nad bayous along this stream. The flood also undermined the hatching house and rendered it unfit for further use. This building was moved to a point in the rear of the foreman's cottage and converted into a barn, and a cement brick hatchery 30x50 feet in size with cement floor and steel ceiling and practically fireproof constructed on high ground near the foreman's residence. It is equipped with permanent cement hatching troughs and tanks and « fine set of plate glass aquariums, and is modern in every way. As a protection for all time for the canyon ponds, a waste water ditch or canal 2,000 feet long, 12 feet wide at the bottom and 25 feet at the top, and 6 feet deep, was excavated along the west side of the ponds to carry off the flood waters, the outlet to this waste ditch being protected with concrete bottom and sides for a distance of </seg>

            <seg id="p023">GAME AND FISH COMMISSION _■;; 78 feet. The replacement work on the two washed out dams required about 58,000 yards of dirt to be moved with teams and scrapers. To change the channel in the Minnechaduza creek a ditch was scraped out about 12 feet wide, 6 feet deep and 500 feet long. This work 1b not yet completed. To protect the banks of the large Bass pond east of the cottage, 450 feet of riprap were built, two feet wide requiring 125 wagon loads of rock quarried on the grounds. This was an expensive piece of work as rock had to be hauled gome distance, but the work is now permanent. The posts for two miles of fence were cut on state property and a three-wire fence with posts set one rod apart built to enclose the grounds. A roadway has been graded across the grounds and one hundred shade trees set out, a concrete walk built from the resi - dence to hatchery, a cement curbing and crushed stone road built around the hatching house, and the ground between hatchery graded down and prepared to be seeded to grass. The lawn in front of residence has been sodded with blue grass, and the foreman's cottage repapered and painted interior and exterior. Two bridges have been constructed across the spillway, and a new work horse, 25 new shipping cans and other hatchery equipment as needed has been added. As a result of the flood the crop of fish at this station was curtailed in 1915 as only the two original ponds escaped damage; this year the crop has been all that could be desired. In addition to the trout hatched this year, over 50,000 Bass, Crappie, Perch, and Sunfish, from six months to eighteen months old, were planted this fall and the foreman reports by actual count over 50,000 fish yet on hand for spring delivery, about 45,000 of this number being ring Perch and the balance Crappie and Bass. SPECIAL APPROPRIATION. The last legislature set aside $2,000 for addition to Valentine hatchery, and $1,500 to acquire 440 acres of land and fence same. The item of $2,000 has nearly all been expended for the new hatchery building and equipment, but for some unexplained reason the town council of Val - entine has refused to give the State title to this additional land although secured from the government for this purpose, and this money will re - vert to the general fund. CONSERVATION OF FISH As a result of the small appropriation made for this purpose over half a million fish comprising Bass, Crappie, Perch, Sunfish, Catfish, Bullheads, Carp, and Buffalo fish, were seined from shallow ponds where they would either perish from the waters drying up during the summer or suffocate for lack of air during the winter, and practically every com - plaint concerning fish left in these shallow ponds has been investigated and the fish removed to living water whenever it was possible to carry on the work with profit to the State, ponds being seined near Ashland.

When the dry weather is of long duration these fish perish. People living in the vicinity should be allowed to remove the fish of edible size after paying the State the usual small license fee, and the fish not fit for the table should be re - moved to living water wherever possible. As I mentioned in the last report the U. S. Government Bureau of Fisheries, the States of Wiscon - sin, Illinois, Iowa and many other .states spend large sums on this work, and we can afford to spend more thav we do now to good advantage. There are enough bullheads go to waste in the overflow ponds along the Missouri River every year to stock every mill pond in our State, and with meat at its present price, this waste should be stopped. COARSE FISH. For the past two years, the Chief Game Warden has turned over all requests for permits to seine coarse fish to this branch of the department, and I have advised persons making such requests that state employes were now empowered to do this work and sell the coarse fish to cover the ex - pense of seining. In a great many instances when parties making these requests found out that the law had been changed their enthusiasm in rid - ding the waters of the undesirable fish wilted and they took no further in - terest, showing plainly they wished a permit as a cloak to violate the law. However, many of these letters were written in good faith, and in such in - stances men and nets were sent out to seine the water as requested and about $600 over the expenses has been accumulated in the Cash Fund from this source. We have seined none of the larger lakes or streams but if the high cost of living continues I think it would be advisable to seine out and market a lot of Carp and Buffalo Fish the coming year. Improve - ments at the two hatcheries and the saving of fish from overflow has required so much of my time that I have not devoted the attention to this branch of the work as I anticipated when I made the last report, but I hape to devote more time to it in the future. FISH CAR "ANTELOPE." The last Legislature appropriated $700 for necessary repairs, fur - nishings, and painting, and $800 for an aerating plant and fixtures on fish car. Owing to the many repairs needed this amount was inadequate to cover the expense and a small part of the repairs had to be paid out of the cash fund. We had intended to place a gasoline engine and air pump on the car to furnish air to the fish tanks but the Interstate Com - merce Commission rules forbid the use of a gasoline engine for this purpose so we installed four air pressure tanks 12x48 inches in size with necessary piping, pet cocks, air liberators, and gauges, which are charged from the train air system: this works quite satisfactory and provides air for about five hours when the car is set out on siding or waiting for train connections. Four more air holders will be added before the spring shipping season doubling the air capacity. This car has been in service for twenty-five years and as a matter of economy it would be better to have a new car built than spend any more in repairs. While the best of care has been taken of it in the way of painting and repairs, it is too small for our present requirements, costs as much as a larger car for transportation, and from this time on will be a constant bill of expense for repairs. The cost of a new car would range from $5,000 to $15,000, according to whether we secured a built-over wooden car or a modern steel one. Most of the fixtures and furnishings on the present car could be used on a new car. In addition to the improvements enumerated a </seg>

Recognizing the value of the annual tish exhibit at the Fair, both from the standpoint of education and its worth as an attraction, the Fair Board authorized me last summer to finish installing the permanent ce - ment, steel frame, and plate glass construction began in 1915, and for the first time at the last Fair we had no leaking tanks, cracked or burst aquariums, and the Fair Board and this department both had an exhibit in which they could take pride. The size of this building should be doubled, allowing us to show not only the different species of fish but their growth from the small minnow to fish of adult size. The Fair Grounds are becoming more beautiful every year and at no distant day, with the growing importance of Lincoln, will no doubt become a part of the park and boulevard system, and the fish exhibit could very readily be made a permanent fixture. New York, Philadelphia, Detroit, Indian - apolis, San Francisco, and many other cities now have permanent fish exhibits, and public spirited citizens of Chicago have just announced their intention of donating $150,000 for the installation of a public aqua - rium in one of the city parks. GERMAN CARP. Owing to the high cost of living and the necessity of some kind of cheap fish, several states are now advocating the stocking of waters not adapted to the better varieties of game fish with German Carp. The last report of the Michigan Fish Commission suggested stocking the shal - low and marshy lakes in the northern peninsula with carp. While this part of Michigan is rich in game fish they suffocate in these shallow waters on account of the severe winters and Carp which hibernate re - quire much less air and would thrive in waters where the game fish would perish. This is largely the condition in many of the lakes in our sand hill region, many of them are not only too shallow to winter Bass, Crappie and Perch, successfully but are so strongly impregnated with alkali as to render them unfit for game fish propagation. Most of these lakes could be successfully stocked with carp and furnish thousands of pounds of food. I know this suggestion will not be relished by many anglers nor by the fellow who is able to buy porterhouse steak, but it is time to consider the interests of the under dog, and attempt to do something for the man who angles for food as well as for the man who angles for pleasure. After more than twenty-five years of fish cultural work in Nebraska, I am convinced that we have been paying too much attention to the propagation of Pike, Bass and Trout, and not enough to the commoner varieties, and we should not continue to plant these fish where years of experimentation have proven the futility of such work. SUMMARY OF FISH CONDITIONS. During the severe winter of 1915, several of the finest lakes in Holt, Brown, Rock, Cherry, Sheridan, and other counties, which afforded ex - cellent Bass fishing, as a result of the work of this department, were nearly denuded of fish by suffocation and tons of fish lined the shores of these lakes when the ice went off in the spring. I hired U. G. Welker of Dewey Lake, to cut air holes in the ice In Dewey, Hackberry, Trout, Marsh, and Willow Lakes, but owing to the unprecedented cold spell and heavy snows, his work proved futile and the Bass were killed in practically all of these lakes. The Perch seemed more hardy and there is still a good </seg>

The lakes in Brown County suffered severely and a prominent real estate man of Ainswortb told me that the loss of revenue to toe town of Ainsworth by the destruction of these fish would amount to fully $20 per day during the open season. Every effort is being made to re-stock these lakes but It will take at least five years to restore the Bass fishing. Pike fishing has been good in both the North Platte River and in the irrigation lakes in that section! also at some points on the Blue, and Loup Rivers, but is not commensurate with the number of Pike planted. Nice catches of both brook and rainbow trout have been taken out of the Verdigree in Antelope County, the Eagle and its branches in Holt County, Long Pine and Plum Creek in Brown County, Pairfield, Schlagel and Snake in Cherry County, Bordeaux and Chadron and other creeks in Danes County, headwaters of White River and Hat, and Mon - roe creeks in Sioux County. For the first time we are commencing to see some results from stocking the headwaters of the North Loup River with Trout, and from some of the recent trout plants in the North Platte Valley, in Morrill and Scotts Bluff Counties. Unfortunately most of our streams adapted to trout run through pasture lands and as these lands become more valuable they are more closely pastured, the herds tramping down the banks and destroying the hiding places of the trout, rendering them an easy prey to their natural enemies as well as the lawless citizen. Crappie are being caught in every section of the state and nice strings were taken from the Blue River at Milford, where a few years ago people scoffed at the idea of stocking the Blue with Crappie. Outside of the German Carp, the Crappie are sure to produce better results than any other introduced species. For the first time since we have been planting Striped Perch, they have been caught in considerable numbers from the Platte River, the whole length of the stream from Plattsmouth to the Wyoming line, during the past summer, thousands of them being taken from the Platte and the bayous along it a few miles from the hatcheries while some of the lakes in the North Platte Valley and In the sand hills are literally swarming with them. I personally caught over two thousand at a single haul with a 150-foot net from the waters of Huffman's Lake in Scotts Bluff County during May, 1916, and the same conditions exist at many other lakes that have only been stocked about five years. It Is to be regretted that we cannot claim any increase for our best native, the Channel Catfish, as their successful propagation has not been mastered artificially; all we have been able to do is to transplant them from the Platte to less favored streams and lakes. As shown in the tables of distribution the yellow bullhead thrives everywhere and it is a pity they are not more appreciated by the public. A large number of them have been transplanted from the overflows the past two years and in time will richly repay for the work in saving them. The Rock Bass after years of work are beginning to show results, some being taken from Huffman's Lake. They are doing exceptionally well in the lakes in. Chase County and some have been taken from Carter Lake. Douglas County, and Crys - tal Lake, Dakota County, and many other points, but owing to their slow growth they will never cut much figure in our fish production. The small mouth Black Bass, Introduced from the Great Lakes a few years ago, have not met our expectations and I seriously doubt their success in our waters. We have failed to rear them to the fingerllng stage at either hatchery with the same success as the big mouth Bass, and the small plants made the past five years have shown no results worthy of men - tion. The Sunfish, like the Bullhead, is a native fish that will well repay any expense incurred in Its propagation. The Pickerel, which a few years ago seemed to be declining in numbers very rapidly, apparently got a fresh start during the wet summer of 1915 and this year good </seg>

            <seg id="p031">GAME AND FISH COMMISSION 31 catches of them were made in the headwaters and branches of the Elk - horn River in Holt County. Thousands of the small fish were also left out in the overflows and about sixteen thousand were rescued in two years from these ponds and placed back in the stream or planted in the large lakes further west on the Northwestern Line. Buffalo fish, one of the main stays of the early settler as a cheap article of food are stead - ily decreasing. The experiment of introducing the large western Bull - frog seems to be a success in some spots but they do not seem to take kindly to the swampy lakes in the sand hills where I had anticipated ow greatest success; this failure is likely caused by the alkali in the waters as they seem to thrive and increase along the spring tributaries of the Niobrara and at many other points. NECESSARY IMPROVEMENTS. The last Legislature was quite liberal in allowing money for the sup - port of this branch of the department and as a result the state property at both hatcheries is in excellent condition as an inspection would show, but we are a growing commonwealth and each year shows the public more critical as to the conditions and accomplishments of their pubilc institutions. Visitors at any public institution rarely ever take into con - sideration the amount of money at the disposal of the superintendent or manager to make improvements or to keep things spic and span, but expect things properly kept whether they have the money for labor or not. The Gretna Hatchery has long been recognized as one of the beauty spots of Nebraska and one of the best institutions of its kind in the country, and I am hopeful that the comin? Legislature will allow us suf - ficient funds to keep it in first-class condition. The hatching house, su - perintendent's residence, assistant's cottage, barn, store room, work shop, and light plant building have all been eithei built new or remod - eled in the last six years, and will require little expense except painting for many years to come. The ice house and tool house were built years ago without any effort at ornamentation or architecture and a new roof is needed on the ice house, and we need a new combined tool house and garage and more room for storage of nets, shipping cans, and other equip - ment. By using the old material in the present building and combining the ice house, tool house, store room, and garage, in one building $2,000 would be ample to make this improvement. More cement walks should be constructed and all the rest of the ponds should be cement walled; more grading will have to be done to provide room for the hundreds of automobiles that now visit the hatchery during the summer months; a large number of shade trees should be planted to take the place of those killed by the seventeen year locusts, and more ornamental shrubbery should be planted; the large Bass and Catfish ponds should be excavated deeper and more money is imperatively needed for necessary labor; a new battery of hatching jars should be provided and a light auto truck should be added to the equipment, both for use at the hatcheries and for fish rescue work in seining overflows; also a new work horse and spring wagon. At the Valentine sub-station about ten acres more pond surface should be added, and a small addition built on the foreman's cottage; this station should also be provided with a light auto truck for drayage purposes and for collecting fish food.

Contrary to the general impression, this department has never directly spent a dollar of the large sums collected as fish and game licenses, and about the only benefit this commission has derived from the collection of these moneys is a large amount of animosity and criticism from a portion of those who have paid these fees, while the school fund has been en- riched far beyond the amounts we have been allowed out of the general fund. We have been compelled to go to each Legislature and beg for funds to support the department and make necessary improvements at the hatcheries. Practically every state now has a flsh and game com- mission and nearly every one 1b supported either wholly or in part by licenses imposed on anglers, hunters or commercial fishermen paid di- rectly into fish and game funds for the support of such departments. Nebraska stands alone in compelling the unwilling sportsman to pay his fish and game license to support the schools already provided for better than those of most other states. All kinds of schemes have been proposed to divert this money from the school fund same as is done with automobile and other licenses collected by the state. Personally I think this is all wrong and that we should go before the coming Legislature and ask them to appropriate the money that has been collected In the past two years or an equal amount out of the general fund for the coming two years. This is the plan followed In our sister state of Kansas. This would put the department wholly on its own resources, and future gap- </seg>

            <seg id="p035">GAME AND FISH COMMISSION 35 port would depend entirely on the vigilence ofr the warden and the ef ficieney of the hatcheries. % PUBLIC INTEREST IN FISH CULTURE While the average citizen pays little attention to the work of fish propagation and protection, the fact is that a state like Wisconsin, richly blessed by Providence with a natural abundance of fine fish, will - ingly grants generous support for eight magnificent fish hatcheries. Massachusetts on the shores of the Atlantic with an abundance of salt as well as fresh water fish spends about $100,000 yearly on her fish and game department. The State of Washington, with its wealth of fish both inland and sea, operates some thirty fish hatcheries to assist in keeping up the supply, while our neighboring state of Iowa spends about $100,000 every year in the propagation, protection, and conservation of fish and game, money being derived from fish and game licenses. RECOMMENDATIONS. First. Change the open season on Black Bass from April 1st to June 1st. Second. Fix a size limit at which Channel Catfish. Crappie, and Striped Perch may be legally taken. Third. Impose a license on commercial fishermen operating on the Missouri River, same as the Iowa law. Fourth. Prohibit seining for minnows, for bait puriK&gt;ses except in running streams and impose a severe penalty for taking or destroying immature fish. With the exception of the loss of the Bass in the sand hill lakes during the severe winter of 1915 and the accident at the Valentine sub-station the following summer, the past two years have been very successful for this branch of the department. I have been given a free hand in the opera - tion of the hatcheries and have had loyal support from the employes and Chief Warden Rutenbeck. Respectfully submitted. W. J. O'BRIEN.
