Respected Sir: In harmony with the statute fixing the duties of the State Fire Marshal, I have the honor to submit herewith the Twenty-Ninth Annual Report of the Department of Fire Prevention for the calendar year of 1937. Respectfully submitted. HORACE M. DAVIS, State Fire Marshal. February 15, 1938. </seg>
            <seg id="p004">STATE OF NEBRASKA DEPARTMENT'S FINANCIAL STATUS By legislative enactment, capitol stock fire insurance companies and non-resident mutual companies licensed to do business in Nebraska pay three-eighths of one per cent of gross premium incomes on direct business written, and state-wide mutual and assessment domestic com - panies pay one-eighth of one per cent of like incomes. This tax is the sole, limited income for the support of the Fire Marshal's office. The proceeds from this fund cannot be used for any other purpose: nor can the state be liable for any expenses incurred in excess of current funds. The chart on the opposite page shows that 1923 receipts reached a peak of $23,000 and went to a low of $14,000 in 1933. The same chart shows operating costs soared to an unprecedented hitrh during 1933 and 1934 when depression and incendiarism were at their worst, and when income was lowest. During these years the credit balance in the state treasury became gradually reduced. At the beginning of 1937, expenses had come down as income became slightly better until the two lines almost ran in parallel. Crop and weather conditions brought on an un - expected economic and social &lt;"ondition that resulted in another incen - diary wave during the early part of the year. Also delinquent tax liens and gradual deterioration of buildings required extra work in inspection and condemnation activities. The department funds are so low at the beginning of 1938 as to warn that activities must be curtailed. This is especially true because early assessments received from fire insurance companies for 1938 will be fully twenty per cent lower than last year. It is a fit problem for the next legislature and the executives of the insurance companies to consider. Graphs on the opposite page and detailed financial report following show results of the efforts of the department with the funds available.

The insur - ance carried was correspondingly 1e55— 528,308,890 and 517, 593,397, re - spectively. The fire losses were $294,326 less than in 1936— £2.3 14,049 and $2,049,723, respectively. The excessive dry weather during July and August, 1936, resulted in a much greater number of fires during those months than during the same months in 1937. With the decrease in the number of fires and the correspondingly less amount of losses during 1537, as reported by fire chiefs, the amount of insurance reported paid by insurance companies was $214,192 larger than in 1936. This is probably due to the fact that insurance companies are reporting their losses paid more consistently than in previous years. Every insurance company doing business in Nebraska has reported losses to this office in 1937. </seg>

            <seg id="p011">DEPARTMENT OF FIRE PREVENTION ARSON INVESTIGATIONS The law states that fires of nnkown origin in Nebraska shall be forthwith reported to the fire marshal's office. The responsibility rests equally upon fire chiefs, insurance companies and insurance adjusters to so report, and especially if there be suspicion of incendiarism. There was a nation-wide decline In arson cases during 1937, but Nebraska proved the exception. The year started off with several bad cases and so continued into the summer months. Again exceptional, there was a marked falling off of incendiary fires in the early fall, with one five-week period when no suspicious case was reported to the state office. During the year, 113 cases were investigated as against 87 the year before. The 113 fires were in 53 counties. It may be significant that more than one-half of them were in the southeast part of the state and considerably more than one-half involved rural properties. Most of the remainder had to do with poor buildings in small villages. The investigators discovered that 47 of the questionable fires origi - nated from accidental, perhaps careless, causes but that 66 seemed to be set fires; 47 motivated by insurance carried and 12 started through malice or by insane or incompetent persons. In the remaining 7 cases, there was insufficient evidence to form any substantial conclusions. Of the 113 fires, there developed 81 persons who might be suspected. From the following table, it will be noted that enough evidence was gathered to warrant filing complaints against 62 of them. Thirty-one confessions were taken. INVESTIGATION, UNKNOWN ORIGIN FIRES, 1937. Fires of Unknown Origin Investigated 113 Thought to be Accidental Origin 47 Thought to be Incendiary Origin 66 To Collect Insurance 47 For Malice or Insane 12 No Conclusive Evidence 7 Persons Suspected and Investigated 81 Arson Complaints Filed 52 Sentenced to Penitentiary or Reformatory 24 Discharged at Preliminary Hearing 6 Acquitted in District Court 3 Parolled from the Bench 4 Insane and Incompetent Committed 4 Deported by Federal Officers 2 Fugitives from Arrest 2 Juvenile Court and Other Charges 5 Pending Jury; Trials . 3 Suicides and Deaths 3 </seg>
            <seg id="p012">STATE OF NEBRASKA VALUED POLICY LAW Again the state fire marshal observes that the Nebraska Valued Policy law is an incentive to crime No matter what evils its authors sought to cure by its enactment^admittedly punitive— it offers a con - stant temptation to an assured who is in hard financial straits to over - insure and burn his property. It is particularly true of farms, where a fire results in total loss in 67 per cent of the cases. The first arrest, conviction and confession of 1937 sent an aged farm woman to the York Reformatory, a neighbor to the penitentiary and two Mexicans back to their fatherland. Sordid tales of a broken family, of sex and money lust and a growing disregard for law-observ - ance until one fatal step too far. Two colored women from Omaha are inmates at York for very like offenses. Each wanted to spite a common law spouse. One burned up his Sunday suit and the other set the shack on fire so the errant husband could not entertain unwelcomed guests. A man and wife, each formerly widowed, married after each had raised a family, each owning good farms and with money in the bank, wanted to go on an extended visit Lest their children quarrel about their joint funds, they decided the simplest way would be to burn out. The barn went on Tuesday and the house on Thursday, with all con - tents, they claimed. Months later bedding, clothing and dishes were found stored elsewhere. They confessed and within twenty-four hours he was in the penitentiary and she in the reformatory. Another old man brought a peculiar oil can from his Colorado home. The deputy state fire marshal found the cork to the can after the fire at an old house that he owned in a northeast Nebraska county, found where kerosene had soiled the upholstery of the car that was again in the Colorado garage. Two or three earlier fires had turned out right, so why not one more? He confessed, returned to Nebraska and plead guilty. It is doubtful if he will out-live his sentence. This is not all a chronicle of old men but it is generally supposed that people can grow old enough to know better. A man of grandfather years grew suspicious of his wife who was employed as a domestic for a neighbor. In his perturbed state of mind, he threw gasoline through a screen door in the house where she was staying and set it on fire. He also answers to roll call at the penitentiary. A young man who was barely making a living in a small village thought the only way to be rid of a sister and grandmother who lived with him was to burn the house which he was renting. From the pro - ceeds of the insurance on the household goods, he bought a coveted </seg>

Nebraska's first state-wide school for volunteer firemen. It is nominally under the auspices of the state association for firemen, with the active and enthusiastic assistance of the state fire marshal's office. Harry K. "Smoky" Rogers and J. Burr Taylor have promised to come out from their Chicago headquarters to have charge of the program of instruction and will call local men to their assistance. They have expressed the hope that there might be an attendance of fifty or sixty firemen. It is planned to be essentially a "two-story" school, designed to help the village firemen make fire pre - vention inspections, know what apparatus is needed and how to use what is available. Note: Before this report went to press, the Grand Island school was held, with an attendance of 400 active, interested firemen repre - senting 102 communities. Three intensive days were devoted to studying various local problems for volunteer firemen. Smoky Rogers and Burr Taylor did not charge for their time or expenses. Grand Island firemen and firewoir.cn did everything possible to make the meeting successful and pleasant. Fire Marshal Horace Davis was selected director of four regional schools and another state-wide school for next year, the time and places and program to be worked out with the aid of a committee. </seg>
            <seg id="p015">DEPARTMENT OF FIRE PREVENTION FIRE PREVENTION WEEK Fire Prevention Week for 1938 will start on Sunday, October 9, the anniversary of the Chicago fire of 1871, and continue through Saturday, October 15. Local fire departments did the best work in the history of Nebraska during Fire Prevention Week, October 2 to 9, 1937. If the growing interest increases at the same ratio, every community in the state will become fire conscious during the revival week of the coming year. While every fire prevention campaign starts with civic-minded fire - men, it seems well to interest schools, churches, civic clubs, business men's and women's organizations. Let them all take part in whatever way they are best fitted. There is a decidedly practical side to the program. There is little sense in talking the educational feature of removing fire hazards and then not remove them. In almost every community there are several dilapidated old build - ings that are an eyesore. They endanger other and better buildings. Generally they are empty, often encumbered with back taxes or past - due mortgages. No town is better than its community pride, and dilapidated structures, old junk piles and patches of weeds destroy local pride. Such places grow bad so gradually that observant people are scarcely conscious of how they affect strangers. There is a way of getting rid of the bad places but it requires some active interest The National Fire Protection Association, Boston, is able to supply posters and other literature adapted to Fire Prevention Week. Requests for such supplies should be sent in as early as possible and before the supply is exhausted. The fire marshal's office is always glad to assist in the way of planning campaigns, furnishing literature or sending out speakers. The Nebraska Fire Prevention Association, Omaha, can and will be helpful. Making early plans for the week will insure success, and will tend to prevent conflicting local activities. CHRISTMAS TREE FIRES There was noticeably fewer Christmas tree fires during the holidays. The fire chiefs have taken an active part in the elimination of fire ; waste at this time of year by cautioning the public through the news - papers and public statements. SCHOOL FIRE DRILLS Fire Chiefs have taken an active part in school fire drills, especially during fire prevention week. On many occasions, the chief, with a few of the volunteers, has gone to the school house during school hours and supervised the drill.

The law provides that the manual shall be supplied to each school in the state for use in fire prevention classes. The purpose of this manual is to supply lessons in conformity with the state law that makes it mandatory that the teacher give at least thirty minutes each month to this subject. COMPARATIVE RURAL LOSSES The rural losses during 1937 were $674,180 or $147,969 less than for 1936. In 60 per cent of the number of fires, there was a total loss. Fifty-two per cent of the loss, or $349,132 was not covered by insurance. This loss was sustained by the rural property owners. In 391 rural fires, there was $1,005,570 worth of property involved. </seg>
            <seg id="p018">STATE OF NEBRASKA DISASTROUS FIRES IN 1937 There have been 12 notably disastrous fires in Nebraska during 1937, involving a total loss of $360,705, according to reports by fire chiefs. On February 4th at 9:30 P.M. the firemen of Beatrice weie called to the Black Bros. mill. They were unable to control the fire and there was a complete loss of $125,000. The cause remains unkown. The Ak-Sar-Ben fire just outside the city of Omaha not only resulted in a large monetary loss— s6l364— but caused the death of three persons, with eight others injured, including one fireman. Seventy-three valuable horses were burned to death. The cause of this fire is "unknown". A high wind, together with the heavy suction through the barn, made an impossible condition for the firemen to handle. Arcadia had a disastrous fire on April 25th, starting in the early morning. The business section on the north side of main street block was nearly wiped out and much damage resulted to buildings on the opposite side of the street. The fire started in the basement of one of the store buildings, actual cause unknown, and rapidly spread. The fire departments from Ord and Loup City responded to the call to give assistance. The big start, combined with the high wind, was more than the combined fire departments were able to control. A hot bearing was the cause of a fire which burned the mill at Arapahoe on July 15, just outside the city limits. The Arapahoe fire department was not equipped to fight fires beyond the city water supply. It started about 4:30 in the afternoon and resulted in a complete loss of the mill and contents, valued at $65,000. A fire of "unknown" origin, but by an explosion, resulted in a loss of $63,428 at Hastings on December 12th. The fire started in the Hested store and rapidly spread to other buildings. The explosion blew out all the windows in the rear of the store on the first floor. It seems probable that the fire started in the basement and reached some kind of explosive before discovered. Kearney was visited by a bad fire on February 14 causing a loss of $20,200. The fire started in an auto parts business and resulted in the total destruction of three other business places. It is supposed that some one dropped a cigarette in an accumulation of oily rags and •mouldered till 2:30 in the morning. </seg>
            <seg id="p019">DEPARTMENT OF FIRE PREVENTION On October 3rd, the Stroud Manufacturing plant in Omaha— the Little Red Wagon — unused for several years, was a total loss. Communi - cated to other buildings the total loss reached $30,127. A bulk oil station at Fairbury was struck by lightning on July 16, early in the evening. The resulting explosion blew the end of one of the three bulk tanks, weighing 1000 pounds, more than 300 feet driving it through one house and into another, the occupants of the house miracu - lously escaping serious injury. A mother and child were taken to the hospital. The explosion and fire caused damage to 43 homes within a radius of 300 feet of the oil tanks. Burning, off paint with a blow torch caused a fire in a funeral home at Fairbury on October 21st resulting in a loss ol $8,000. Burning off paint with a blow torch has caused 18 fires during 1937. The Wooden Shoe factory at Columbus, reported to be the only factory of this kind in the United States, was badly damaged by fire on September 22nd. A dust explosion was the cause of the fire. The damage to the factory and an adjoining church was $13,000. A loss estimated at $52,000 was caused by fire in the Armour Cream - ery building at O'Neill on May 6th. The fire was noticed about 6:30 in the afternon when two men who were working in the refrigerator quit for the day. It looked like the firemen had the fire under control until it broke out in the top of the elevator shaft. A strong southeast wind carried the flames from the shaft across the top of the building. After more than six hours fighting, the fire was extinguished with a loss of about 80 per cent of the property. The Ord hospital was located on a hill too high for the water sys - tem. Fire of unknown origin broke out in a clothes chute on February 2nd, burning the building to the ground. The loss was about $33,000. This fire resulted in awakening the city council, and a booster outfit was purchased which will force water to the top of any building in the city. There have been a noticeable number of fires during the year that might have turned out disastrously had it not been for the prompt and efficient services rendered by the volunteer firemen. The active services of these volunteers have saved the property owners of the state millions of dollars. </seg>
            <seg id="p020">STATE OF NEBRASKA RURAL ELECTRICAL INSPECTION Upon the joint urge of the directors of fourteen rural electric dis - tricts and Washington representatives of the Rural Electric Adminis - tration, Governor Cochran and the Attorney General's office were con - vinced that the Department of Fire Prevention had statutory authority to take charge of inspections for farm electric wiring. This was agreed to on the admitted theory that the added activity should be self - supporting from fees, and was done upon invitation of customers or districts. One of the first steps in the program was to select Chas. M Horham who had been Lincoln city fire inspector, to take immediate charge of inspections. P. E. Clement of our office was placed in charge of the accounting. Three-days schools for wiremen were started immediately in the rural power districts under the auspices of the Department of Vocational Education. One such school has been conducted by Mr. Horham each week since the program began. We think these short" courses are having the desired effect in showing the hazards of poor workmanship and the use of poor materials. Rural inspectors examine chimneys, lightning rods and other fire hazards as well as electric work. Such defects are followed through and corrected on the unquestioned authority of the fire marshal's office. With scarcely two months of experience with electric inspections, there are many details yet to be worked out, but it is already observable that the increased interest in safety on the farms is resulting in awak - ening electrical consciousness in the cities and villages. Inspections are being made only of installations begun after the first of November What, if anything, shall be done about the three thousand farms that were energized before being inspected is a problem for the next session of the legislature to determine. There has been a marked increase and improvement in the tire - fighting equipment of the volunteer fire departments. Many of the larger cities have purchased modern trucks equipped with the best, booster power and chemical extinguishers. The lighter equipment dis - carded by these larger cities has been purchased by villages that have just organized a department or are improving the equipment in use. Special campaigns have been put on in many of the cities and villages to acquaint the citizens with their duties when a fire breaks out. Especially have the fire chiefs tried to acquaint the public with the law which provides that civilians shall not follow a fire truck closer than 600 feet. Articles and display adds have appeared in the local papers prepared by the fire departments. </seg>
            <seg id="p021">DEPARTMENT OF FIRE PREVENTION INSPECTION OF STATE BUILDINGS A thorough inspection of all state buildings was made during the year and removal of fire hazards suggested. There was found a hearty cooperation with this department by all officers in charge of state prop - erty. The removal of rubbish and other inflammable materials were ordered to be cleared from the capitol and all electric wiring which did not meet the requirements of the department's regulations was or - dered changed. State institutions under the Board of Control as well as the state university and normal buldings were given a thorough inspec - tion and hazardous conditions ordered removed. There have been organized and are now in the process of organi - zation many rural fire fighting districts in accordance with the law passed by the last session of the legislature. The districts are, for the most part, in connection with a local fire department, and the equipment when purchased will be housed and manned by the local volunteer firemen. Subscriptions for funds to buy equipment in many localities has made it possible to provide fire protection immediately, and the rural district tax will be used to keep the equipment in repair and up-to-date. SALE OF FIREWORKS In the past thirty years the celebration of Independence Day with fireworks has caused more deaths and injuries than the war for Ameri - can independence. There is a growing sentiment for discontinuance of this method of celebration. After the casualties of the last Fourth of July, a number of cities and villages have enacted ordinances prohibit - ing the sale and use within the corporate limits. While this is the first step in the right direction, it does not prohibit any one who seems to see a little profit in the sale from setting up a stand just on the out - skirts where passersby may make their purchases. Within a few days— mostly on the Fourth— there were 86 injured, mainly children, in Nebraska, and property losses amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars. In the nation there were more than 300 violent deaths in the week-end celebration. In Nebraska, the city of West Point spent the large part of the Fourth fighting a fire, caused by fire works, that resulted in a $10,000 loss. lowa reports a million dollar loss in one fire as a result of fire works. An explosion in a fireworks factory in Florence a week before the Fourth caused a loss of $10,000 and much excitement. A housewife escaped miraculously while working in her home a short distance from the factory. Some one touched a lighted cigarette to fire crackers In a drug store causing a heavy loss to the owner. Only a few instances men - tioned, but they show the need of some action to stop the destruction. </seg>

These figures represent the losses outside of incorporated cities and villages They include rural business places as well as farm property. The large number of claims paid by mutual insurance companies in November may be accounted for by the fact that a special effort was made by the state fire marshal's office that month to get the reports of losses paid by county mutuals. Most of the smaller mutuals reported in November the losses paid during the first ten months of the year The number of claims paid do not represent the number of fires. There are often several claims on one fire. The average claim paid by mutual companies was $408.32, and the average claim paid by stock companies was $583.66. In comparison with rural losses reported by fire chiefs, we find that there were 391 rural fires reported with losses estimated at $674,180, and that there were 1,353 claims paid by insurance companies amounting to $656,383.05. According to fire chiefs' reports, about 62 per cent of the value of rural property was covered by insurance. Of the rural fires reported by fire chiefs, there were 236 where a total loss was sustained. </seg>
