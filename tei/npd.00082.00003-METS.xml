VonSeggern Webster Bladen P. H. Larrick MR. COOK — I don't see why we shouldn't have the election of ■officers this afternoon instead of waiting until tomorrow morning.

The ballots are not ready and we have to wait for them. PRESIDENT VANCE relinquished the chair to vice president W. B. banning and presented — THK PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS Members of the State Board of Agriculture, Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: In. following the usual custom it becomes my duty at this time, :as your President, to give you a brief summary of the past year by .your Board of Managers. The control and operation of the State Fair being the primary ■duty of this organization, I will confine my remarks having to do with ■the activities coming directly under this head and make them as brief »s possible. With the unusual economic, financial and weather conditions which prevailed during the past year, with poor crops, very little money and some criticism, it took some courage to continue with the 1935 State Fair. Now that the Nebraska State Fair series of 1936 is over, there is no cause for regret, it was a wonderful show. The first two or three days were cold and rainy, the poorest kind of Fair weather, but the people came any way and the Fair went on. Under the conditions just mentioned, I am safe to say we are all well pleased with the 1935 Nebraska State Fair. We had wandered i Jong way from home in the last few years, but we finally kicked Old Man Depression off the track and told him to let some one run that run. So watch our smoke from now on. The exhibits in all the departments of the Fair were very good. </seg>
            <seg id="p012">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The Boy's and Girl's 4-H Clubs put on a good show in connection with the older breeders. During the Fair one of Lincoln's prominent business firms. Gold and Company, gave the Boy's and Girl's 4-H Clubs a banquet and theatre party at which there were 555 guests. Pari-imitucls . . .\ After a big majority of voters at the general election in 19 3 4 said they wanted pari-mutuel betting on horse racing in Nebraska, then the Legislature legalized pari-mutuel betting on horse racing in Nebraska, and being urged by a good many business men and others from differ - ent parts of the State, the Board was finally prevailed upon to try them out. We did with the following success — money taken in, 553,969.00, the State Fair's share was $6,430.00. W. P. A. Projects worked out on Fair Grounds . . . A sanitary sewer is one project for which the \V. P. A. allotted ?7,972.00 and the Fair Board supplied $2,39G.OO. The second one is for lowering water mains for which the \V. P. A. supplied $486.00 and the Fair Board $116.00. ' The third one is for roof repairs, painting, moving barns and other •work for which the W. P. A. supplied $4,406.00 and the Fair Board supplied $2,493.00. Although we try to hold our expense down to a minimum, I think it would have been a mistake not to avail ourselves of the privilege of getting some of the \V. P. A. money. In closing my few remarks I want to extend my thanks and appreciation to the Board of Managers, the office force, the big Board of twenty-nine members, the business men of Lincoln, and the people at large over the state for their fine cooperation in helping to make the 1935 series of the Nebraska State Fair a grand success. I thank you. R. R.

IT WAS MOVED, SECONDED, AND CARRIED WITHOUT RE - MARKS, that the Report of the Auditing Committee be adopted. PRESIDENT VANCE — We will now listen to the Report of the Secretary. 1035 SECRETARY'S REPORT The year 1935 has passed into history with Its many changeable conditions for agriculture. Following the extreme drouth of 1934 many farmers were compelled to sell a large part of their breeding stock and seek feed loans to carry the remainder of their animals through the winter. Then came the dust storms followed by rains and wet weather which kept the farmers out of the fields and delayed the planting and cultivating of corn. The Republican Valley was visited by the most disastrous flood ever experienced in the history of the state with the loss of many lives, devasting farm lands and destroying property. This was followed by a mid-summer drouth in many parts of the state which cut down production, and while there was an abundance of forage in most parts of the state, many farmers did not have grain and live stock to sell so that agriculture is a long way from being back to normal conditions. As fairs are dependent on the support of all classes of people we cannot expect to gain back the attendance and number of live stock and agricultural exhibitors that we had before the depression until </seg>
            <seg id="p017">REPORT OK NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AflRICri.TUKE the unemployed have work, the people have money and products to lit up these exhibits and the management has some assurance of the revenue to put the premiums on a more creditable basis. Formulating plans and putting across a successful state fair in these trying times is a difficult problem for the management, as they are confronted with a very different proposition than any other state activity or business, as contracts and arrangements must be entered into months before the fair is held and the success or failure will depend largely on weather conditions before and during the fair. People on the side lines can criticise and suggest, but the Board of Managers are responsible for both sides of the ledger. Weather conditions the first two days of the 1935 state fair were very bad. The first day the program was declared off entirely. The next two days dirt roads were impassable and we are sure cut down the attend - ance. But in spite of these and many other handicaps, we feel that the fair was a very creditable one and financially the first one since 1928 that we kept out of the red. Live Stock Exhibits Exhibits of live stock were all that we could oxpect under condi - tions as they were. Many of the classes were as good as were ever exhibited here, but were lacking in numbers. Exhibitors were handi - capped the past few years in the mid-west. The prime reason that breeders show their stock at fairs is to advertise their herds and sell their produce. On account of the drouth and depression there has been scarcely any sale for blooded stock since 193 0 until the present year, and many herds were depleted on account of the scarcity and high price of feed and poor demand for breeding stock. The size of the premiums are only a part of the inducement to fit show herds' and individuals, and as the demand for pure bred breeding stock comes back there will be more animals fitted for the show ring. For the information of some who have criticised the size of our premiums, I wish to compare them with some of the neighboring state fairs in our class, namely Missouri, Kansas and Oklahoma, each with a larger population than Nebraska: Kansas Kansas XebrasUn Missouri State Free Oklahoma Horse Dept $1,647.00 $1,550.00 $1,843.00 $2,224.00 $1,440.00 Beef Cattle 4,351.00 2,918.25 2,124.00 2,961.00 4,070.00 Dairy Cattle 3,076.00 2,520.00 2.5S8.00 2,237.00 2,800.00 Swine 3,010.00 2,285.00 2,720.00 2,170.00 2,100.00 Sheep 1,150.00 1,110.00 e 474.00 670.00 1,526.00 Poultry 985.50 *• 1,328.75 1,050.00 2,985.00 Farm Products .... 4,871.75 1,324.25 2,240.00 1,950.00 1,920.00 </seg>
            <seg id="p018">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE - 20 Ce added to the money offered to the Kansas breeders winning prizes in the open competition. ** Missouri Show all breeds. The sheep department of our Fair was again lacking in number of entries and I would recommend an increase in premiums for this - department. Horse Show The Horse Show was the best ever held at the Fair. Some of tho classes were considered by good judges to have been as good as they had ever seen in the state. Weather conditions, for the three nights of the show were the worst of the week and cut down the attendance greatly. Much credit must be given Mrs. Gardner for the able way in which she managed the show. . 4-H Club Work •-.■•■ I ':••/■• As usual the boys and girls exhibits In the 4-H Club Work, under the leadership of Mr. L. I. Frisbie, were a real outstanding feature at the Fair. To enumerate all of the things of interest that are to be seen in the 4-H Club Building during every day of the Fair would be a real task. One must go and see for themselves the exhibits put on by these young farm boys and girls. There are the different types of baby beeves, dairy calves, swine, sheep, poultry, the canning, cooking and sewing exhibits as well as the judging and demonstration teams. There is something to see and hear every hour of the day and every day of the Fair in this department. Agricultural Hull The agricultural products exhibited were very good considering the drouth conditions in many parts of the state. There were sixteen county collective exhibits and ten central idea exhibits. On account of the rules limiting the central idea exhibits to ten entries, we were compelled to turn down several entries. I feel that the rules for this class of exhibits should be changed so as to give bonafide exhibitors a better chance. Also, there is considerable dissatisfaction among the county collective exhibitors as to the rules requiring separation of the entries in the open classes from the collective exhibits. This change was made in 1933 and many feel that we should go back to the old plan. The Horticultural display was good and caused much favorable comment. The dairy products exhibit was something new at the fair this year and occupied a space in the central part of Agricultural Hall. </seg>
            <seg id="p019">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OK AGRICULTURE The Government had a large booth where they had exhibits to ex - plain the Agricultural Adjustment Act. The rearrangement of the interior of Agricultural Hall providing for three ramps instead of one to reach the balcony, made the different classes of exhibits much more accessible to the public than formerly. The Educational, Domestic Products and Needle Work exhibits in this building were up to the usual high standard and were the center of much interest. Poultry Exhibit The exhibits of poultry were up to standard and the number of entries increased over those of 1934, but on account of the high price of feed and lack of sale of breeding birds the show is not what we would like to see. I feel that the offering in premiums should be raised in this department as it is one of the most popular departments of the fair. Pigeon Exhibit The interest in the Pigeon Department has been very marked the past two years. In 1934 the number of entries totaled 305. in 1935 they were 410. The pigeon exhibitors spent a great deal of time and effort in decorating their department of the Pair without expense to the management, and they are to be complimented upon the fine showing made. Fish Exhibit The Fish and Game Commission painted and repaired the fish build - ing and (put in a very creditable exhibit which attracted the usual num - ber of visitors. Lincoln Building The Lincoln Building houses the Fine Arts exhibit which is always a place of interest to all fair goers as well as the Nebraska artists who exhibit. The California exhibit of fruits, nuts and grains was also in this building. This is an interesting exhibit and draws much comment wherever shown. The Bee and Honey exhibit is displayed in the Lincoln Building and while the beekeepers stated that the year 1934 and 1935 were poor years for bees and production of honey, the exhibit was up to the level of other years in quality if not in quantity. </seg>
            <seg id="p020">REPOKT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOAKIJ OF AGRICULTURE Manufacturer's Building The space for exhibits in the Manufacturer's Building was all taken up for the first time in a number of years by Lincoln merchants and a few outside exhibitors and demonstrators. The display is one of the most attractive and interesting of the exhibits as they show all the newest and best in conveniences and necessities of the home. Federal Housing Exhibit One of the new exhibits of the 1935 Pair was that put on by the F. H. A. An old house which was hauled onto the grounds was re - modeled on one-hair of the building, leaving the other half as it was, for the purpose of showing how one could have a more comfortable home at little expense. This exhibit was visited by many that were interested in the government housing plans. Machinery The machinery exhibit was the best for a number of years show - ing all the new inventions and improvements in all kinds of mach - inery. One of the most interesting exhibits which came here directly from the "World's Fair at Chicago, was that of the manufacture of twine and was put on by the International Harvester company. Automobile Exhibit The exhibit put on in the Automobile Hall by the Chevrolet Motor Company under the direction of Mr. Kirkland of Omaha, was a very attractive place and the giving away of the Chevrolet car by the Fair Board created considerable interest and no doubt brought additional attendance. State Institutions Exhibit The State Institutions under the Board of Control put in some fine exhibits in the booths under the grandstand and attracted the attention of a lot of people. Better Bnbics Contest and Women's Building To a great many people the Women's Building is a place of interest. There come the babies who are entered in the Better Babies Contest and how pleased and happy are the mothers whose babies win the prizes. This contest was discontinued for a few years but has been held the last two years with almost 200 entries last year. In one part of the Women's Building a corps of nurses are main - tained by the Fair to take care of babies while the mothers enjoy the fair. There is also a room where the women may rest. The play ground and kindernook were well patronized again this year. The emergency </seg>

Bird Depart incut The Bird Department on the outside of the Agricultural Hall, west side, was well patronized. The exhibit was larger with more exhibitors as well as entries this year over last year. . : Cat and Dog Show The Cat and Dog Show on the outside of the Agricultural Hall, north side, attracted many patrons of the Fair. Two new classes were added to this department in 1935, a parade of — "The Boy and His Dog" and 'The Girl and Her Dog" open to boys and girls under 12 years of age. The boys paraded with their dogs on Tuesday of the Fair and the girls on Wednesday. Rural School Chorus and Spelling Contest The rural school chorus and spelling contest on Tuesday brought out quite a representation from over the state. While all children under 12 years of age if accompanied by an adult have been admitted free each day of the Fair, I would suggest that Tuesday be designated aa Children's Day and all school children be admitted free and prizes be given for the best float or display from any one school or locality and arrangements be made with the carnival company for reduction in price of rides for that day. Attractions We had very little criticism from people who saw the program in front of the grandstand. Some of the outstanding attractions were the steeple-chase and high jumping acts put on two days and two nights by the United States Army Olympic Equestrian Team from Fort Riley, Kansas. These horses and riders are now in Europe to com - pete in the Olympics at Berlin. The Fantasies of 1935 and the free acts were well received and the fireworks with the exhibition put on by the Hook and Ladder companies from Omaha and Lincoln Fire Departments was something new. The running races were good con - tests and brought out a lot of enthusiasm and were a life saver for the Fair on Monday and Tuesday a3 the track was a sea of mud and no other kind of speed events could have been pulled off. The parade on Thursday in addition to the regular program, brought a large attendance in the grandstand. The combination of auto races and horse races nearly filled the grandstand on Friday afternoon and had the weather and track conditions been favorable we would have had a record crowd on the first day of the Fair with the Veteran's program and the auto races. The United Shows of America occupied the mid- </seg>

I'ari-Mutuels This was one of the much debated questions with the Board of Managers and it was not definitely decided to put on the pari-mutuels until a few weeks before Fair time, when the Board, upon the request and advice of the grandstand bondholder's committee, business men and organizations from all over the state, voted unanimously to put them in. This brought many people from over the state that came to the fair every day and paid their admission at the outside gate and grandstand as well, that we never saw at the Fair before. Twenty - five states have laws permitting pari-mutuel betting at their fairs — namely New York, Maryland, California, Florida, Louisiana, Texas, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Illinois, Ohio, Kentucky, Delaware, Maine, West Virginia, Missouri, South Dakota, Montana, Arkansas, Oregon, Washington, Michigan, Arizona, Nevada and Nebraska. Maine passed a law last year permitting them to be used only at the state and county fairs. Superintendents and Judges Some of our exhibitors and newspaper critics have seen fit to belittle our superintendents and judges. The Board of Managers have sought to place as superintendents of the various departments men and women that were qualified and have had experience in the line of work called for in the several departments. Any one that has had experience in the show ring knows that it is impossible for superintendents- to satisfy all classes of exhibitors. The judges for the most part are from the Extension Department of the State College of Agriculture, and are men and women that have specialized in the different lines of work that would qualify them to judge the state fair classes and we believe that they have placed the ribbons without fear or favor and have been very satisfactory to the fair minded exhibitors. Attendance Since I have been Secretary we have given out no attendance figures, only paid admissions. This of course does not include the bands, at - traction people, superintendents, all employees, 4-H club exhibitors, rural school chorus, spelling contestants and all children ' under 12 years of age admitted free each day of the Fair. The paid admissions for this year were 80,456. The admission charge was fifty cents day and twenty-five cents after 6:00 P. M., and cars twenty-five cents. The amount received for outside admission was $36,628. We have been criticised on account of these figures not comparing in number to those given out by the former secretary. In 1930 the attendance figures given out by Mr. Jackson were 439,38 2, the admission charge </seg>
            <seg id="p023">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE was fifty cents day and night and fifty cents for cars. However, the amount of the paid admissions for that year with the amount charged for cars included, amounted to only $72,365.50 which shows that there were only 144,731 persons that paid to see the fair and according to the figures given out there were 294,652 people in attendance at the fair that year that did not pay. The financial report at the end of that year shows that after receiving $42,623.35 for maintenance from the legislature and $38,824.39 from concessions, there was still owing at the First National Bank notes to the amount of $20,000 and out - standing unpaid claims for the year of $1,651.42. I am sure if our critics will only be fair enough to analyze these figures and also take into consideration the financial and crop conditions of the state in 1935 compared with those of 1930, they must admit that the 1935 re - port compares very favorable with that of 1930. Slate Fair Handicap One of the greatest handicaps the Board of Managers has had is the' fact that the legislature failed to appropriate money to pay in full the deficits of the 1931-1932 fairs. Many of the state fairs had a larger deficit than ours but at the first session of their legislatures they i appropriated money to pay it in full. The Nebraska legislature of 1933 appropriated one-half the amount of the deficit of 1931 and 1932\ which was paid in 1933. We included the amount of the balance in our budget request for 1935, but were unable to get this allowed, but ip the latter days of the session a group of the claimants, without our knowledge, went before the finance committee and stated they would be willing to accept one-half the amount of their claims in full payment if the legislature would make the appropriation. The appro - priation was made with a proviso that each claimant must sign a receipt in full payment of their claim before the State Treasurer would issue\ the warrant. This brought about some dissatisfaction among the claimants with some refusing to sign the agreement. The Crete Mills refused to accept the seventy-five per cent as final settlement and brought suit against the organization. In 1931 Mr. Jackson contracted with the Crete Mills for feed to sell to the exhibitors at the State Fair. The feed was sold and instead of paying the bill out of th4 money received for the feed he used it for other claims without the cpnsent or order of the Board. The trial came up in district court in October, Assistant Attorney-General Ayres, representing the State Board of Agriculture, claimed that the State Board of Agriculture was an instrumentality of the State Government and was performing a function for the good of the public and was created by Statute and could not be sued without permission of the Legislature. District Judge Chappell in his decision held that the State Board of Agriculture was a private corporation and liable for the amount sued for. The </seg>
            <seg id="p024">KEPOUT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Board has carried the case to the Supreme Court for a final decision. Should the Supreme Court uphold the decision of the District Court, it would leave the State Board of Agriculture in a position that they might be sued at any time. There are two classes of state fairs in the United States today. A large majority of the fairs, ours included, are run by organizations which were created by statute and interlocked with the county fairs, allowing the county fairs to have a voice in the naming of members of the oi'ganization. These members are chosen for their successful work with their county fairs and interest in civic affairs, public spirited citizens that are willing to devote time and energy to the public good. Many of these organizations were formed like our own when the states were new and sponsored by such men as J. Sterling Morton, Samuel Bassett, Robert W. Furnas and a long list of pioneers and prominent citizens who devoted much of their time and thought to the agri - cultural interests of their state. But the last few years some of the states have done away with these organizations such as Illinois, Mis - souri, Wisconsin and South Dakota, and have put the appointment of a manager in the hands of the governor. This not only divorces the county fairs from the state fair work but makes it a political proposition and when there is a change in governors, a change in managers. During the last regular session of our legislature there were two bills introduced to allow the governor to appoint the mem - bers of the Board and change the set-up of the State Board of Agri - culture. After several hearings before the Committee the bills were indefinitely postponed. Improvements on Fair Grounds In the Agricultural Hall the old ramp at the south end of the hall was torn out and three smaller ones built at different parts of the hall leading to the balcony. A cement driveway was put in. A room was also built for the transformers and switchboard inside the building and a new line was put into the building. The Coliseum was all rewired and transformers and switch board put in a fire-proof room, twelve new flood lights were installed and two chandeliers six feet in diameter and twelve feet long were put in. The Cattle Barn was all rewired and new power line installed. A new power cable was laid in the center - field to the grandstand. Three new large flood lights were put on the grandstand. Before the Fair it was necessary to put a coat of asphalt on the roof of the Lincoln Building, Auto Hall, Poultry Building, three large dining halls and a large number of concession buildings. A new truck was purchased at a cost of $575.00. Since the Fair we have had a number of W. P. A. projects. One was for relaying, repairing and lowering 1,335 feet of water mains putting them below freezing. Another project was for dismanteling the two </seg>
            <seg id="p025">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE large pony or horse barns on Dunham Avenue and building one new horse barn 180 feet long opposite the Coliseum and extending the three other barns to the same length with a cross section in the center 3 0 by 36 feet. Another project was for painting all the barns and wooden buildings on the grounds. Another project is moving the dirt thrown up on the bank by the Sanitary Sewer District in widening Salt and Oak Creeks and leveling the ground next to 14th street. A large part of the labor on these projects and some material and equip - ment has been furnished by the W. P. A. office. Another project on which work is going on at this time is grading Dunham Avenue and the street by the grandstand and the Coliseum; putting in concrete curbing and three inches of crushed rock and asphalt facing on the streets. Most of the material on this project is furnished by W. P. A. Three new fire hydrants were also installed on the grounds this year. In accepting these projects it has been necessary for the Board to obligate themselves for a considerable amount of material, equipment and labor, and on account of the cut in the maintenance appropriation it has been necessary to spend $10,685.15 out of state fair receipts to meet these requirements. But we feel with the completion of this work that the grounds and buildings as a whole will be in the best condition they have ever been in the history of the fair. Too much credit cannot be given to Morris Reichenbach, Superin - tendent of the Fair Grounds, for the very capable and efficient manner in which he has looked after these numerous projects. In conclusion I wish to thank all the members of the Board and all those who had a part in making the Fair the success it was. I wish also to thank the ladies in the office for their very efficient and loyal service during my time as Secretary. RECEIPTS !AXD EXPENDITURES OF THE NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE FOR 1OS5.

PRESIDENT VANCE — I want to say that after reading some of the articles in the newspapers, some of which perhaps were not intentional but because they do not know how these things are handled., I am going to ask Mr. Banning to clear up some of these things and tell some of the newer members how these things are handled in the Board, and probably some of you will look at it from a little different view - point. </seg>
            <seg id="p031">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE IK &gt;ARD OF AGRICULTURE MR. BANNING — I want to talk to you a few minutes about some of the propaganda that has been in the newspapers, and I want to explain some things that have been stated both publicly and in what is supposed to be our leading farm paper, The Nebraska Farmer. I don't know where The Nebraska Farmer got this dose of sour grapes, yet I think I do — or what their idea is to come before the people with a mess of stuff that in a great measure is false and misleading. I do know that during Mr. McKelvie's term of office he wanted to abolish the entire agricultural set-up of the Fair Board, he was not successful. At the present time I understand he is on a cruise 1;i some foreign country, and that his Man Friday, in charge, is trying to tell the agricultural interests of Nebraska how to run the State Fair. This is all right, if he knew what he was talking about, or even knew the set-up and facts pertaining to the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture. Mr. Robert C. Vance^ who sometimes poses under the name of Dizzy Ike, or some such cognomen, being like the rest of us in search of bread and butter, has been writing some articles appearing in The Nebraska Farmer. He blames the present set-up for all the so-called ills that he says are affecting the Board at the present time. He makes considerable adieu over the attendance records of the state fairs in the middle west, and says "Attendance totals at six middle west state fairs show a grain of 24 per cent or a total attendance of 358,456. he says less than one day's gate for the great crowds of the past. As to the gain in attendance I would like to cite your attention to the report of the International Associations of fairs and expositions for 1935, wherein it shows under the heading of "Per cent increase or decrease in 1935 over 1934", and cites the following surrounding States: Indiana State Fair, 43%; Iowa State Fair, to which in some instances he points with pride in regard to the attendance, 31%%; Kansas Free Fair, 40%; Kansas State Fair, 12%; Minnesota, 16%; Northern Wisconsin 40% ; and Nebraska 41.6%. It is plainly shown by this report that he did not know what he was talking about, and that bis judgment is not valuable along this line. One thing he did get right, and I am surprised he got it right, was in regard to the number set-up of the Fair. But he says "the secretary has always served as manager of the State Fair". You all know that is not true. "And", he says, "He must be a member of the State Fair Board." He can find nothing in the laws to prevent a manager serving from outside the Board. I would like to refer him to the Statutes on this, which states Secretary must be a member of the State Board of Agriculture, and the secretary never has been the manager. In his indictment, in the next paragraph, regarding the superin - tendents and judges of the different departments, he says, "It would </seg>
            <seg id="p032">REPOKTO1- NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AC.RiCLfl.TUUE be best to build up fine exhibits for the State Pair with tv, or good supertntenden"; H .

Then in another paragraph he speaks of the Pig Tail Board Ho says he found this expression commonly used to designate member of he State Hoard of Agriculture.

Why put out such state - the slate-' m ' 8lCad I&gt;e ° Ple the a * Wcultural societies of Another statement which shows his inconsistency, is "Another secretary writes "In my judgment harness races attract more people than any other class of entertainment". This, he says, "from a secre- </seg>
            <seg id="p033">KKI'OKT OF NEBRASKA STATE 111 IARIJ ( )l" AGRICULTURE tary of a fair association in the state." We admit we did do away with harness races, and I want to read you a letter from a Fair man who has had some experience with these chaps: There are some nice fellows among them, and some who are not so nice. We feel that our association is in the same position that I think every Fair asso - ciation is in on the harness races. "We have lost money on the harness races while making money on auto races." "Harness racing has developed into a racket. If they had four horses in they knew which was going to win." "The Oklahoma Fair has been successful on running races and our association wants to go to running races this year, but has not yet decided." It might- be interesting to you to know another criticism, the other way, just to show you that the Board gets lambasting not only from one side, but they try to lambast them from all sides. An article from "Hoof Beats", a publication in the interest of hor.se men, says. "The one sore spot in harness racing is in Nebraska, where the sport is at its lowest ebb." It goes on to state that how long the horse men will stand for this state of affairs in Lincoln, is a question only time will answer. He speaks of a meeting in Hastings which he says was a success. The purses being small they did not attract high class horses, but he says some of the reports show that the management was able to pay the purses and have a small amount of money left. But friend Vance tells me that the money left was made from the shows and concessions. There we have two ideas — here is a Nebraska man crying for these races — here is that statement of the horse men, and here is a statement from Mr. Morris W. Jenks, Topeka, Kansas, given at the meeting of International Association of Fairs at Chicago in December." "One of the most perplexing things confronting us is the speed - program for fair week. Automobile race days attract splendid crowds,, but all we get to do with the money is to turn around and hand it out for purses for horse races. When I hear the gong which starts another trotting or pacing race I involuntarily reach for a red pencil. No one enjoys a harness race more than I, but no one's hair raises quicker than mine when I see three horses and a dummyfourth lining up for a start. After this meeting, I would like to have some one offer some encouraging words on this subject." Then again in his indictment he says above all the people of Ne - braska demand that the entertainment at the State Fair be kept clean - that the parents of Nebraska demand a clean type of show. I would like to take you to Des Moines, or the South Dakota fairs. </seg>
            <seg id="p034">REPt iRT OF NEBRASKA STATIC HOARD OF AGRICULTURE and some of the other surrounding fairs, and show you the remarkable difference in the class of shows shown on the Nebraska State Fair grounds. We would not, for a little money, put some of these shows on our Fair grounds. Some things may creep into the carnival, but we try to do the best we can and you must have a carnival, you must have some diversion. But if we allowed the class of entertainment shown on some o£ these other fair grounds, we would indeed be subject to critic - ism. They say the American public likes lo be defrauded sometimes and there may be something in it, but if you did not put on a carnival they would say, "There's nothing.to it— it was a dull fair". A statement made by the "Hoof Beats" magazine says "We do not have the figures, but having seen the crowds at the Pawnee County Fair feel sure that the attendance was above other years, and in fact above those of the Nebraska State Fair." Now Pawnee county has a nice little fair and their people patronize it nicely; but when it comes down to figures on the Pawnee Fair it is a different proposition. Their total receipts from all sources in the Pawnee county Fair were $9,619.45, while those of the Nebraska State Fair were $73,052.61. The paid attendance at the gate on the Pawnee county fair were $4, - 703.13, and at the Nebraska State Fair the gate receipts amounted to $36,628.38. Their attendance was 'way down, and would not be considered at one-tenth that of the Nebraska State Fair. Now why will a man make this sort of assertion to try to carry a point for his own selfish greed, when the facts are as shown above. Another thing I want to say is that these surrounding fairs have been more successful because their legislators gave them money so they could put up purses to invite these exhibits. I want to tell you that for the last three or four years this State Fair Board has stood with its back to the wall, no money to work with, and no one of you fellows would take the chances, with no assurance that we would come out whole. Nebraska appropriations in the legislature of 1935 included $10, - 000.00 for Maintenance and $7,000.00 for operating expense and that is every dollar that has been appropriated or is available in Nebraska for agriculture. I want some of those fellows in the legislature to take this in, as they may have been there for years and never heard of it, for it has not been brought out. Your State Department of Agriculture in Nebraska has not a thin dime for its activities, and I think it is time we woke up and did something for Nebraska and for agriculture. The Missouri legislature appropriated $42,500.00 for maintenance of the State Fair. Minnesota legislature appropriated $42,500.00 for maintenance and $45,000.00 for building operations in 1935. </seg>

What could we do with that amount of money in Nebraska. Citv°t k ow h 7n CUy re&lt;!eiVed $22 - 50000 e *«* y« from Oklahoma City toward their premiums. Kansas Free Pair received an appropriation for maintenance and operation of $5,000.00 and $2,500.00 for boys and girls club work The county has a levy of one-fourth mill tax for premiums. You cannot point me to another fair on the circuit that camp out as well as Nebraska did; take out their appropriations and you will find every one of them in the red. And then the grand stand receipts are in a separate fund and we give the proceeds to the bondholders How can any farmer run his business that way. If we had that $12,000.00 that we give to the bondholders we would have what we pay for these attractions. Mr. Reed said they went in and out of these gates on season tickets and were counted every time they came in, in previous years Now we only count the paid admissions and cut out the passes and the duplications in going in and out. Now I want to come down to something else, on this matter we have had some discussion on,— that this was a board within a board. In the last ten years there have been sixteen new members on this board of twenty-nine members, —and they say it does not change In Iowa they have a successful fair because it is a wealthy state; their president has been there for twenty years and more. A man can't understand Fair work in a few days. It takes time to learn how to handle these things, and it is quite a problem to know what kind of entertainment you should have here, and what you would better do there. You must please all classes, and if we had money to do these things with you would have no reason to criticise Nebraska. And what makes me more sore than anything else is the idea of this propaganda that has been put out in the newspaper regarding the Nebraska Board and its work. A tentative report of the 1935 Nebraska State Fair receipts and expenditures, not including grandstand receipts, was as follows: Total receipts $73,052.61 Total expenditures 59,954.45 Showing a balance of $13,098.16 It will take at least $10,000.00 of this money to take care of the </seg>

The total grandstand receipts, kept in a separate account and turned over to the First Trust Company as payment on debenture bonds, was $12,S96.00. The number of paid general admissions this year was 80,45G. During the last three fairs we have given only the number of paid admissions. Prior to that time in the estimate of attendance for the week many duplications were made as the estimate each day in - cluded all concessionaires, exhibitors, attraction and carnival people, "who were counted as many times as they entered the front Rate. As Iowa, Kansas and Minnesota have been hold up to us as model state fairs and organizations, we wish to compare their set-up with our own. Kansas has a board of 16, elected in about the same manner as in this State. Mr. A. L. Sponsler was elected on their board in 1005, served in the capacity of secretary for many years, and only last year was retired due to poor health. Mr. H. W. Avery, their present secre - tary, has served continuously on the board since 1!)18. Mr. E. E. Frizell, their president, has been a member of the board since the Kansas State Fair was organized. Messrs. C. W. Taylor, Paul Klein, J. C. Moeller. Perry Lambert, and O. O. Wolf have been on the board at least 15 years. All other members of their board have been on for ten years at least. Their county fair organizations have a vote in the election of fair officers about the same as ours. Iowa has a board of l.T members. Mr. C. E. Camerson was their president from 1904 until 1931, serving continuously as president during that time, and then was made president emeritus. Cbas. F. Curtis was elected a member of their board in 1905; H. L. Pike was elected in 1904: A. L. Corey, their secretary, came on the board in 1911. The present Iowa board members, with two exceptions, have served for 14 years or more. Their annual election is carried on along the same lines as ours, with the county fair delegates having a vote in the annual meeting. Minnesota fair is organized in about the same way also, the county fairs participating in the election of officers. Most members of the Board of Managers have been on the board for a number of years, Mr. Raymond Lee, their secretary, since 1917. The Nebraska State Fair has also been criticised for the charge at. the front gate, mentioning Topeka, Kansas. While Topeka has a free gate, under a law passed in 1913, the county in which Topeka is situated makes a levy on the taxable property of the county and pays all the premiums offered by the Kansas Free Fair, by warrants issued by the county treasurer. This is also true of the free fairs in Okla- </seg>
            <seg id="p037">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE homa. v We doubt very much whether Lancaster county would vote to pay all the premiums offered by the State Fair in lieu of a free front gate. In 1934 the Oklahoma State Fair, at Oklahoma City made a charge of 50£ at the front gate and 25c? for cars, and they charge very much more in the grandstand than we do. They not only have all their grandstand receipts, but they received from Oklahoma City, from a levy made on the taxable property of the city, enough to pay the premiums offered by the Fair, $22,500.00, which was made a present to the State of Oklahoma. This while the Nebraska State Fair must turn over all of their gross grandstand receipts to the bondholders and pay for the grandstand attractions and all other expenses of the grand - stand from other receipts. MR. THOMPSON— I hold no brief for the newspapers, but I think it is absolutely unfair to give Mr. Vance no chance to defend himself before the new members who are present here and now. I believe the gentleman has made some observations that he can't back up. In the first place he said the Nebraska Farmer statements was a reflection on all the twenty-nine members of this Board and all the superin - tendents, and I venture to say no fair-minded man could interpret it as anything of that kind. I doubt if the Nebraska Farmer brought out anything of the kind, or that it was brought out before the Nebraska legislature. I think we have an ideal set-up right here if they will let it operate as it should. I don't want to see this organization get into politics. It shows right there that there is something in it, and I am wondering if that is not the reason that the Board was not able to get a more liberal appropriation for the Fair. I have no criticism of this Board. I know what they are up against in carrying on the Fair, but you can't deny that there is that criticism, and all we ask is that you reform some of these things, and I believe it is only fair to these men here who are getting one side, to permit Mr. "Vance to defend himself. ■ MR. BANNING — I do not make any assertion that I can't back up, and I don't think I need anyone to defend me, but I am going to ask Mr. Reed to answer Mr. Thompson's statement, because he has been up there more than any of the other fellows, and I think he knows more about it than I would, and even if Mr. Vance is in the audience he can have a perfect right to defend himself. We want to be fair. SECRETARY REED — Why don't we get an appropriation as large .as we used to get? Prior to the last legislature, when Mr. Bryan was governor, he called me to meet with a committee regarding a budget for the Nebraska State Fair; and while I was there he made the state - ment several times, "You have the pari-mutuel, and you don't need </seg>
            <seg id="p038">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE an appropriation." Members of the Board went before Governor- Cochran, and he asked several times if it would not make a lot of difference on account of our having the pari-mutuel, that we could make plenty of money out of that. I think you all understand that the legislature was trying to cut down expenses, and they cut the agri - cultural activities from $30,000.00 to $15,000.00 and they cut down the premiums from the 4-H clubs from $10,000.00 to $7,000.00; we didn't get any of that money to use, so we thought we would cut all along the line, and while there are a few members whom I could name who had it in for the State Fair, they had it in for individuals more than anything else. PRESIDENT VANCE — Is Mr. Vance in the audience? If so, we would like to have him come up and give his side; we want to be per - fectly fair. Mr. Vance seems not to be in the room; are there any questions that anyone would like to ask". Don't be backward, we would like to. have this explained as fully as we can. If there are no questions, we will proceed. The next thing in order is nominations for members of the State Board of Agriculture. FIRST DISTRICT — Nominations were made of W. B. Banning, Union, D. W. Osborn, Pawnee City, B. F. Preston, Lincoln, R. C. John - son, Mead, and L. C. Chapin, Lincoln. SECOND DISTRICT — The nominations were A. H. Miller, Blair; and Gates Lilley, Papillion.

They are closed. </seg>

MR. BANNING assumed the chair. The first in order is nominations for the office of president. MR. PURCELL — Mr. President, members of the State Board of Agriculture, and delegates: When Mrs. Purcell and I were raising a flock of youngsters some years ago we kept a cow, and I wanted to get a good cow for the family supply of milk; so I went to a farmer who I knew had a good cow, and I said "I believe you have a cow for sale". He said yes sir. I said "Is it a good cow?" "He said, "Yes, it is a good cow". I said "How much milk will she give", and he replied, "She will give you all she has got". Shortly after that I wanted a man in my organization, and I went to a friend to inquire about the qualifications of an applicant, and my friend said in reply to my inquiry, "He is a good man; he will give you all he has got." And that expression stayed with me; I have applied it at various times in State Fair work, and I have found that the man who will give you all he has got is a valuable man. And I want to apply this in connection with the president of this organiza - tion at this time. When I first got real well acquainted with our friend Vance was in 1919, when he and I were both members for the first time of the. House of Representatives. I was impressed with his ability and good judgment, and with his desire to do good things for the State, and I said to myself, "He is giving the State all he has got". And so it went on, and he served in the Senate, and I found the same sterling qualities in his work there, and again I said "He is giving the State all he has got." Then in the State Fair work, and I feel that I aided in that par - ticular, in getting him interested in this Fair work and on the State Board of Agriculture, and we have all known his work on the State </seg>
            <seg id="p051">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICCI.f UltE Board of Agriculture, his interest in the Fair and the time he has given to it, and the deep study he has given to the problems we have confronting us in this State Fair work and the splendid ability he has shown on this organization, and I want to say to you that he is still giving to the State of Nebraska all he has got, and that is a lot. And now, gentlemen, it gives me real pleasure lo place in nomina - tion for the office of President of the State Board of Agriculture for the coming year, Mr. R. R. Vance. MR. MILLER — I move you, Mr. President, that the rules be suspend - ed and the secretary be instructed to cast the ballot of this body for Mr. R. R. Vance as president for the coming year. The motion was seconded and carried unanimously, the secretary cast the ballot, and Mr. Vance was declared elected. MR. VANCE — I want to thank you fellows for the honor that you have bestowed upon me for the second year. I feel very grateful that you allow me to fill out a two year term. No matter how good the president might be, this Fair will not be a success unless you have a good bunch of men on the Board of Managers to work with the presi - dent, and even then your Fair will not be a success, with good men on the Board of managers unless they get co-operation from the full board of twenty-nine members of the State Board of Agriculture; and even then you cannot make your Fair a success without the co-operation of your business men and your farmers out over the State; and so it takes all of these fellows to make a success of this Fair. Don't get it into your heads that it is only this small bunch of us here, we don't take credit for that, for you know as well as I do that if you don't all put your shoulders to the wheel this old Fair won't get very far. I PRESIDENT VANCE resumes the chair, and asks for nominations for vice president. MR. GRAFF — Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen: It is needless to say this gives me a great deal of pleasure, and all that sort of stuff. I want to place in nomination a man for first vice president with whom I have come in contact a great deal for twenty-five long years, you might say continuously throughout the years, ihere and there, and especially in connection with the work of the State Board of Agricul - ture. As you will notice this gentleman's time expires as a member of this Board at this time. He was re-elected absolutely without opposi - tion. I hope Mr. Banning did not do as Mr. Purcell said the president had done, "Give us all he has got", for I hope he has a few apples left at home. Mr. Banning and I came on this board at the same time, twenty- </seg>
            <seg id="p052">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE five years ago. It may be because of my poor service that it has taken me a year longer to complete my service than it did Bill Banning. At the time we were put on this Board Mr. Banning was elected for only one year to fill out the unexpired term of some member, who it was I do not remember. There are few people connected with the activities of the State of Nebraska who do not know more or less about Bill Banning, and it is useless for me to try to tell you what kind of man he is. He has proven in his work on this State Board and in other activities, and as secretary of the Horticultural Society of this State. For 'many years the legislators of the State have had Bill Banning among them; Bill Banning has made himself known to all the governors that Nebraska has had for a good many years. He is not a new man, he is ah old, seasoned Fair man; if anyone is entitled to recognition on this board it is Bill Banning, and I am certainly glad to know that I have the privilege of nominating him for first vice president of the State Board of Agriculture. MR. MILLER — Mr. Chairman, I move that the rules be suspended and the secretary be instructed to cast the ballot of this body for W. B. Banning as first vice president for the coming year. The motion was seconded and carried unanimously, the secretary cast the ballot and Mr. Banning was declared elected as first vice president. PRESIDENT VANCE — The next in order is nominations for second vice president. What is your pleasure. This is the only one I am going to say a word on, fellows, and I am not doing this to influence any of you; but this gentleman is very sick at home, and I want to say that he has been one of our very good men on this Board. Let us not turn him down flat because he is sick. Everybody knows that Mr. Widle has been a very valuable man on this Board. MR. MIILLE — Mr. Widle is a man of very great ability and has been a capable and efficient man on this board, and I want to nominate him for the office of second vice president. MR. CEDAR — It gives me great pleasure to second that nomination, as I know we have had a good worker in Mr. Widle. MR. MIILLE — I move you that nominations be closed, the secre - tary cast the ballot under suspension of the rules, and Mr. Widle be elected as second vice president of this Board for the coming year. The motion was unanimously carried, the secretary cast the ballot for Mr. Widle as second vice president, and he was declared elected. </seg>
            <seg id="p053">REPORT i )!■" N EHKASKA STATE BOARD OI-" AGRICULTURE PRESIDENT VANCE — Next we will have nominations for treasurer. MR. RUSSELL — I want to place in nomination the name of T. H. Wake, of Seward, for treasurer. No other nominations were offered. MR. PURCELL — I move that nominations be closed, the rules be suspended, and the secretary be instructed to cast the ballot of this convention for T. H. Wake as treasurer for the coming year. The motion was seconded and carried, unanimously, the secretary cast the ballot, and Mr. Wake was declared elected as treasurer. PRESIDENT VANCE — Now we will hear nominations for the office of secretary. MR. STEYER — I am not going to make a speech, but I wish to nominate Perry Reed for secretary. MR. PURCELL — I move that the rules be suspended, nominations be closed, and the president cast the ballot of this convention for Perry Reed as secretary for the ensuing year. The motion received a second, and was carried unanimously. PRESIDENT VANCE — I want to say that I have known Perry Reed for a good many years, I have worked with him in the legislature, and all through on this Board. I think he is a conservative man, and if we ever needed such a man it is right now, fellows; we have got to save every nickel we can, and being part Scotch he is going to hang onto every one of them; and it gives me great pleasure to cast the entire vote of this meeting for Perry Reed for secretary, and he is declared elected to that office for the ensuing year. PERRY REED — I wish to thank you for the compliment you have paid me. I want to say this, that during the three years that I have been in the office of secretary there have been many times that it has not been a pleasant proposition. I want to say that the ladies here and myself have been confronted with many propositions that were very disagreeable. When I came into the office the Fair was clear down at the bottom. I don't know of any time in the history of the Fair when it was in the financial condition of what you might call bad repute with a lot of people for the reason that for three years prior to that time the Fair had been unable to pay its premiums in full. It was with the State Fair a good deal like it was with every other business. While some of the Board of Managers had realized for a number • of years that this thing was going to come to a head some time, and we </seg>
            <seg id="p054">REPOItT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOAKD OF AGRICULTURE would get a jar. others felt that there never would be a time when the Fair would not be going up and up all the time. But when the depression and the drought came on it took a tumble; and you all know that when an organization or an individual can't pay its bills they have got a lot of people sore at them. And I want to say another thing; prior to the time I came in here many passes had been given out to people all over the country. The first year I was in here I cut out fifteen hundred passes; the next year I cut out half that many more, and the third year some more, until this year no one had a season ticket without he was doing something for the Fair. And of course when men have been used to walking in and getting all the passes they wanted, when that was shut off they were sore; and these men who are making the main criticisms of the Fair are some of that number, and of course the secretary is the goat. I have tried to do what the Board of Managei-3 wanted me to do; that is what the secretary is for; I don't think the secretary should manage the board, but the board should manage the secretary, and do it in a business like way. I believe the Fair Grounds and buildings are in the best shape now that they have been in the history of the Fair. I thank you. PRESIDENT VANCE— We now come to the election of the four members who will be put on the Board of Managers besides the officers; who will you nominate in the First District? MR. OSBORN — I would like to nominate Mr. Shubert. MR. MIILLE — I move that nominations be closed, the rules be suspended and the secretary cast the ballot of this assembly for Mr. J. F. Shubert. The motion was seconded, carried, the ballot was cast and Mr. Shubert was declared elected. PRESIDENT VANCE— We will now take the Fourth District; Mr. Boyd is the man whose term expires at this time. MR. ATKINS — I nominate Mr. J. A. Boyd as a member of the Board from the Fourth District. MR. PURCELL — There being no other nominations from the Fourth District, I move the rules be suspended, the secretary cast the ballot for Mr. J. A. Boyd, and he be elected a member of the Board from the Fourth District. The motion was seconded, carried, the hallot cast, and Mr. Boyd was declared elected as such member. </seg>

The motion was seconded, carried, the ballot was cast and Gates Lilley was declared elected as member of the Board from the second district.

HAWK — I make the usual motion that nominations be closed the rules be suspended, the secretary cast the ballot and Mr. J. S. Golder be announced as the Board member from the Third District. The motion was seconded, carried, the ballot was cast, and Mr Golder was declared elected to the Board from the Third District. MR. HAWK — The Resolutions committee submitted a brief report a little earlier stating that we had no resolutions; since then matters have been brought to our attention, and I wish to submit the following RESOLUTION: RESOLUTIONS WHEREAS, H. J. McLaughlin, a member of the State Board of Agriculture for many years, who is deeply respected by this Board and who, by his own choice retired at this time, is now ill at his home in Hall county AND WHEREAS, R. Widle of Genoa, another member of the State Board of Agriculture who is also deeply respected by this Board is ill THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that we extend to Messrs H. J. McLaughlin and R. Widle our sympathy and our best wishes for their speedy recovery. Respectfully submitted, C. S. HAWK, Chairman; CHARLES GRAFF, D. W. OSBORN. And I wish to move the adoption of this resolution. MR. GRAFF— I wish to second the motion to adopt that resolution. And I wish that we should take a rising vote on the matter. </seg>
            <seg id="p056">KKPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The resolution was adopted by a unanimous rising vote. PRESIDENT VANCE — That completes our program; is there any - thing else that anyone wishes to present before the meeting? MR. GRAFF — Might I be permitted to make a brief closing remark to this convention? PRESIDENT VANCE — You may. MR. GRAFF — We have just now voted our set-up for the coming year of this great organization. Our attention has been called to some matters by the man whom you have just re-elected as president of this Board, as well as by the man whom you have just re-elected as secretary of this Board. You may not know that I am talking seriously when I speak of the remarks these two men made; but I ask, do we take them as seriously as we should. In a few minutes we will leave this convention and will be on our way home. Our homes are scattered here and there all over this State. Are we going to keep in mind that it is our duty to assist these officers in carrying on this work? When Perry Reed told you about the difficulties and the trials that the secretary finds himself con - fronted with throughout the year, if we stop to think for a moment of the turmoil and the dissatisfaction in the business world for quite a few years past, we can interpret what Perry Reed said, that the day had to come when this wave that we were riding was going to blow up, — and it did — and there was a remark I got in the habit of making for years. I didn't know when, how far away it was, but there was a day of reckoning coming, and it behooved us to stay close to shore. I am sorry to say that thought was not followed, because too many of our good people liked the way they were living much better than to retrace their steps and get back on solid ground. My friends, if you recall when I went out as your president I called the attention of you people to one thing in particular, a matter they said we never could meet; I saw it was running away with this organ - ization, if you recall what I said. "I am sorry to state to you people that that evil yet remains unsolved." I knew the day would have to come when the evil would be solved — and it was — it was solved be - cause sheer interest made this Board of Managers do it. It created a lot of dissatisfaction among the people out through the State, but we received hundreds of complimentary letters for what they had done and what they might do. This matter was continually coming up, and it took this blow to wipe it out. Bear in mind, my friends, that that is one thing that does not set good on many people who have had those privileges in past years, and in my generation I believe there is a tendency to opposition and fault </seg>

But say — all you need to do, Mr. President, Secretary, and members of the Board of Managers, is to tell the people the facts; facts don't hurt; the good people of Nebraska will understand. That pass is one of the worst things I found in my connection with the Board of Managers, and it seemed there was no way to handle it when the Fair was going fine and everybody was prosperous. But you know what resulted, and now this management has got to carry that sting. You and I are for these boys who will do what they tell us they will do; we have aright to take them at their word, because they have done those things. And if we think anything of this great organiza - tion, or if we are the sort of citizens of this State we would like to have the people think we are, then we can do no less than to stand up and stand by the men who are going to carry this great work during the coming year. MR. SHUBERT — I move we adjourn. The motion to adjourn was seconded and carried, and the conven - tion of the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture stood adjourned Sine Die. </seg>

            <seg id="p079">FIRST SESSION MONDAY, JANUARY 20th, 1936 1 :30 P. M. The twenty-seventh Annual Convention of the Nebraska Association of Fair Managers was called to order by President R. C. Johnson of Mead, at the Cornhusker Hotel, Lincoln, Nebraska, on Monday, January 20th, 1936, at 1:20 o'clock P. M. PRESIDENT JOHNSON— In opening our meeting this afternoon: it gives me great pleasure not only to introduce our first speaker as the Mayor of our Capital City, but a man whom you all know for many years our governor in this great State of Nebraska, and whom many of you know personally. It is my pleasure to present to you now, Hon. Charles W. Bryan, mayor of the city of Lincoln, who brings to us an ADDRESS OF WELCOME Charles W. Bryan Mr. Chairman, Members of the Nebraska Association of Fair Man - agers: I do not know of any organization that I would rather attend or that I am more deeply interested in than I am in coming here today' maybe because I am kind of "horsey", and interested in livestock Yesterday I planned to go out to York county to look at some stock a man had for sale; I have some livestock out over the state and I wanted to look at this bunch, and then it was below zero, and when I went to get the car out I found I had a tire down, and then I thought of this meeting, and thought that what I would lose by going out there yesterday to look at the stock would be more than made up by what I would get here today mingling with the men who are responsible for the livestock all over the state of Nebraska. While I am here to bring you an address of welcome that does not cover my interest in what you people do and have done, the place you occupy in the development and doings of the State of Nebraska. Our State Fair is a great institution for all the people of the State of Nebraska, and if it was not for the county fairs I do not know how you could have a State Fair. The County Fair is close to the people close to those who would come to the State Fair, and not only attend but bring their exhibits, and enter to here things they are interested in as represented by those exhibits. It gives encouragement to the people of the state and helps them in furnishing better stuff. I am never satisfied to hear a man or woman point to anything and say </seg>
            <seg id="p080">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE "that is good enough", I am interested in seeing them develop leader - ship and try to do better than anyone else; that creation of an ambi - tion to do something better than some one else is what makes Ne - braska and the nation what they are. So you people, in giving en - couragement to the farmers of the state, and especially the voung farmers, the prospective farmers, the boys and girls— what you do for them in the creation of a desire to build better stock, better fruit better products of all kinds in the State of Nebraska, is an obligation of ours to you people to an extent that it is impossible to say and I believe in giving appreciation to a man while he is alive. We of the city of Lincoln are happy to have you here, to have the publicity of this meeting, and we realize that what you are here for will benefit the whole state. You people of the state own the capital city the capital city does no' own the state. We are dependent upon you but not you upon us I am proud of the county fairs; I have discovered that people take in the County Fair that you never see in any other gathering in the world. They go in there, lay aside their own business and their wor - ries and troubles and meet there at a community center for that county and exchange greetings and exchange their views and so on, tell what each other have done, and the changes that have come on this farm and that farm, the crops they have raised and so on. And one of the big things that this organization promotes, is to get these young boys and girls who are raised on the farm to take up that line for their life work, instead of going into town with the white collars, where there is no such place as back on the farm. I was raised on a farm and operated a farm until I was twenty-six years old, and commenced shipping horses and mules when I was fifteen years old. and I had the privilege of going in the farm wagon behind a good pair of mules and I tell you there is nothing like the thrill that comes with a thing like that. A farmer friend called me up two weeks ago and said he had the best pair of mules he had ever seen in the state, and he was going to ship them the next day to Omaha, and wanted me to come out and see them. I told him I would leave at 9 o'clock the next morning and I got up and went out there, and he brought out the best pair of mules I ever saw. He put them in a sale at Omaha and they brought $610.00 the following morning. I am not here just as the mayor of the city, but because I am nterested In what you are doing. Farming is the greatest business in this country. The citizen in the town is dependent on the farm In my line of activity in public affairs I try to reduce expenses and try to work for the boys and girls, and It is all in co-operation with what you men are doing, and that is the reason for my presence here today. </seg>
            <seg id="p081">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS I would be glad to help in any capacity to keep the county fairs in existence, and keep them alive, if there is any danger of their not remaining in existence. The people maintain and support them, and I do not think the county fairs have suffered as much as other lines of business from the depression we have been having. My coming here may not benefit you but it benefits me, because I want to tell you boys that in the city people are interested in your work. They realize the work you are doing to make this state what it is. And they all realize that they are dependent upon the success of what you are doing, the encouragement that you are giving to the boys and girls, which will make for their own success in the towns and cities and on the farms of the nation. It is a great sacrifice on the part of you people; I know my first experience with a county fair. I used to ride around with a big sash on and think I had the biggest place in the United States. I am not as much in touch with the county fair as I would like to be, but I am interested in stock raising, and I am now trying to buy some fllleys to raise with my other stock, and I have nine calves out here that I take great pride in. I am greatly in earnest in coming here and expressing my apprecia - tion of what you are doing for your state and counties, and I want you to know that we are glad, as a city, to have you here and want to co-operate in any way we can to make your meeting and your work a success. We all appreciate your efforts, and the sacrifices you are making for your state and counties, and we hope your meeting will be a success and that the newspapers will publish full accounts of your doings and your plans for future years for the benefit of this state, so that they may enter more fully into your work, and be in position to co - operate and make your work more successful, in giving to the people of the respective towns and counties not only enjoyment and enter - tainment, but the inspiration to produce more and better in the future than they have in the past. I thank you. RESPONSE Mr. diet G. Marshall Mr. Chairman, Mayor Bryan, and friends: I am not going to say very much. You will hear from me more or less during the meeting, but I want to say just a few words in response to this welcome from Mayor Bryan. We are mighty glad to have you with us, and to have you give us such a wonderful welcome. We also appreciate what you have to say of the county fairs, and the personnel and management of those fairs, and what they are giving to the state of Nebraska. We do feel that this organization does a work that is worth while and worthy. We feel that it is doing a great work in the advancement of agriculture. You have referred to the work of these men, and to the sacrifices they have made and are making. And I want to say to you that when a </seg>

And we do sincerely thank you for your words of welcome. PRESIDENT JOHNSON— At this time we will have the roll call of the different counties, and later the secretary will pass out slips of paper to each man here, on which you will write your county, and the complete membership of your county fair board. Label or check your president and secretary of your newly elected board. It has been impossible for us to get the entire membership 'of the county fair boards; if there are two or three from one county, do the same with each, write the word "delegate". We want the complete list of county fair managers in Nebraska. Also please give the dates of your county fair for the coming year. We need a revised list. These lists will give us the foundation for our list of county fair boards. This year we tried to reach these boards, and found two men listed who had been dead for more than a year.

PRESIDENT JOHNSON — It is always customary in these meetings to give the entertainers, the Show People, or whatever we might call them, a chance to appear before the convention and announce their type of entertainment. Many of these cards have been handed in, and I would now like to present the people who have carnivals or other entertainment, that they may say a few words regarding their attractions, as the County Fair boards will doubtless be interested in some of these attractions to provide entertainment for their fairs. And I will ask these people to give us their home addresses as we are often asked for them after the convention is over, and we can then furnish the address to them and give you a contact. The first man I want to call on is Ed Holder. </seg>

PRESIDENT JOHNSON — We would now like to hear something from Mr. Howe, whom I introduced a few minutes ago. MR. HOWE — Ladies and Gentlemen, Members of the Nebraska Fair Managers Association: I am glad to be with you again this year. I make it a point to attend your meetings, and like to attend the Ne - braska Editorial meetings. I don't know why I feel so inclined, but I find a real wholesome interest in the people in both businesses. I don't know that I have very much to say at this time. I don't know very much about County Fairs, but I made a talk a couple of weeks ago at the Iowa Association on Publicity. If any of you are ever in difficulties along these lines, I am here, and I will be glad to be of any help and do all I can for you. PRESIDENT JOHNSON — Tell us something about the Rodeo. MR. HOWE — I started the rodeo a few years ago, and I knew ab - solutely nothing about the Rodeo business. I started with one rider, and we used farm horses, and put it on at a total cost of $50.00 for the </seg>
            <seg id="p087">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OK FAIR MANAGERS four performances. The people seemed to like it, and the next year I sent a man to Wyoming to buy horses, and limited him to $3.50 a head, and he brought back a load. We used a little grandstand and limited the grandstand to the women and children. It was more luck than in - telligence on our part that we built it up, but as time went on we built a grandstand and charged for it. While we were at it we were educating the people to what Rodeo is, so we found it is the same as with a ball game, many people do not become interested until they see the game and know what it is, then they become interested about it. We stayed with it with a lot of ambition, and in our grandstand we seat a little better than seven thousand people, and we have never slipped behind in any year. This year we broke more than $6,000.00 over any previous year. That show has been built up on the same basis as any other successful enter - prise, — showmanship, which you can divide into three factors, man - agement, attractions and publicity. All three must work in unison, and if the Pair or Rodeo is to be a success these must be pretty well balanced. I might cite an instance in publicity. A lot of people think that advertising is a necessary evil, and say "Let's spend what money we have and get it over with," instead of arranging a system, deciding about your surrounding territory, how far out you want to go, how many homes you want to reach, what newspapers will do you the most good. I believe there is more money made, and more money wasted, on publicity than any other one thing. The Campbell Soup company spends $12,500.00 every week for one page in one issue of the Saturday Evening Post and $3000.00 for one hour broadcast over the radio, merely to sell a ten cent can of soup. Pay a little more attention to this matter, gentlemen, go into it and try to find out how many towns you want to cover, and how many houses you can get your advertising into, and I believe you will find out you can get along a lot better after you have had experience in adver - tising. Here is wishing you the greatest success in your county enter - prises. PRESIDENT JOHNSON — The next number on the program I am sure will be an interesting number. It has been my pleasure for a short while to have the acquaintance of this speaker. It has been my privilege to hear him in an address at a meeting on the Northeast Fair Circuit last October, and I am sure we shall enjoy him as much as he enjoyed one of the stories on that occasion.

You, as fair managers, have been alert to new and changing situations. You have been farseeing and have put a con - siderable amount of thot on your county fairs. Among many other things, which I will not stop to enumerate, you recognized the value of 4-II club work and encouraged it individually and thru your fair organizations. This has been commendable, and as it should be, for we are all interested in agriculture and it's improvement. 4-H clubs, as well as fairs, are educational in their activities. As Agricultural Agents and others have brot things to your attention with reference to 4-H clubs, you have given the matter thot and, with your mature judg - ment and according to the resources of the fair, have helped in every way possible. I am going to try to point out to you a way which I feel you can ac - complish two things. 1st — Relieve your secretary of a considerable amount of work. 2nd — And by no means of lesser importance, give the 4-H club boys and girls some valuable training and experience. Secondarily, this will do a few other things: 1st — Make a little closer connection between 4-H clubs and your fairs. 2nd — Make for a smoother operating program. 3rd — Assist you to build your program. 4th — Enable you to train future fair board members, superintend - ents, and workers. Two county fairs of which I know have used this system, one of which is represented here today, and, after I explain the situation, I am going to leave it to a representative of one of them, your secretary, Chet G. Marshall, to give you his observations. Ever since I have been Agricultural Agent, and that has been almost seven years, I have used this system in cooperation with the fair boards within the county; first in cooperation with the Webster County Fair at Bladen and second with the Washington County Fair at Arlington. In order to operate smoothly, there must be a little fore thot given it and a little planning. Before I start to explain the situation, I first wish to state that I will use the 1935 fair year since it is more recent </seg>
            <seg id="p089">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS and comes to my memory a little more clearly. I also have a copy of all the letters, forms, and materials which I used, a copy of which is on exhibit here, and primarily because it was the first year this sys - tem was used in Washington county and will give you all the steps. Class "L" is our 4-H club class in "Washington county. It may be "O", "P", "X" or some other letter or number in your county but, for discussion purposes, I wish you to pardon me if I say class "L," and wish you to know that I refer to the 4-H club class. A Junior Fair Organization is exactly what we have in Washington County in Class "L". This organization operates and functions exactly like a county fair except that it does not sell tickets, handle conces - sions, or have an annual meeting as you know annual meetings. I came to Washington county in April, just past. I made it a point to become acquainted with the County Fair Board and the County Fair. I offered my assistance and received a royal welcome. I tried to find out as much as I could about the 4-H activities. After I had done this, I felt they could be made more valuable to the fair and to the boys and girls. Sometime the first part of July, I contacted the Fair Board, explained a junior fair organization briefly, and asked them if they would let the boys and girls get some experience and really run their own or - ganization within class "L", of course under the supervision of myself, who was superintendent of this class, and the Fair Board. I outlined the values to be obtained, which I have given you above. They readily gave their consent to go ahead. With this consent, it became necessary to set up the organization. Since this was the first year, I called in the 4-H club county executive committee for the purpose of selecting out of the active 4-H club mem - bers a President, Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer, and Superin - tendents of each of the different departments. This they did, and will continue to do in future years. Names and positions were printed in the premium list at the head of Class "L", a copy of which you can see in the exhibit. You know most of us are vain and we like to see our name in print. So are the boys and girls and their parents. They get a big kick out of it. You will also notice that the premium list states that entries must be made by August 17th. This is 10 days before the fair opens and gives the Junior Fair Secretary an opportunity to get the entries made in the judges' books and the entry tags made out before the fair opens. By having this done, it relieves a lot of congestion the first day of the fair in that when the exhibitor brings his exhibit the secretary reaches </seg>
            <seg id="p090">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE in the file and hands to the exhibitor all the tags, stickers, etc. and he attaches them to each article after which they are given to the Sup - erintendent who arranges them in the exhibit. In additon, this method enables the management to know just how much space is necessary. This enables the superintendent to arrange a more attractive exhibit with less work for if he knows there are to be four kitchen aprons or 200 cans of fruit, or whatever the exhibit may be, he can arrange the exhibits as they come in and very seldom is it necessary to rearrange the different articles. In addition, it enables us to know exactly how many stalls, pens, etc., are necessary for livestock and, with this in - formation, the adult fair can take on or reject adult exhibits according to the space available. A few days before the closing date for entries, a circular letter is sent to each 4-H club boy, girl, and local leader in the county explain - ing the making of entries and calling to his attention a few things of importance, as well as the date entries must be made. A mimeographed entry blank is enclosed in this letter. A copy of each of these also is in the exhibit. About a week before the fair opens, the boys and girls, who have been appointed to assist with it, are called into a meeting by the Agri - cultural Agent. The Senior Fair Secretary should also be present at this meeting. The general set-up is explained to them and the duties of each individual is gone over before the group so they understand just who is to do each part and why it is necessary to do certain things. At this time, a program of activities is made out giving the time and date of each activity thru fair week. I will discuss this more at length a little later on. The four officers particularly are chosen from the older boys and girls who have had the most experience In club work and exhibiting at the fairs and show ability to organize their activities as well as having displayed evidence of leadership in their previous activities. The president, of course, has general charge of the whole organiza - tion. It is to him the others are to present their problems for solution. He Is to render decisions. Of course, he is instructed to use his judg - ment and, if it is a particular problem, he brings it to the Agricultural Agent, who is Superintendent of Class "L", and he offers suggestions or takes it on up to the Senior Board, if necessary. Several times during each day, he discusses with the agent the situations which have come to his attention. It is the president's duty to see that things run oft smoothly and on time. He is familiar with every detail and can step into the situation in case someone is hurried or needs help. The Vice President carries on the same as any other vice president, and he is chosen with the Idea of being advanced to the presidency the </seg>
            <seg id="p091">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS following year and one of the better superintendents will be advanced to Imposition. It is felt that these two positions should be filled by The Secretary of the Pair keeps the minutes of the meetings and has charge of making the entries in the judges' books and making up the entry tags, filing them in alphabetical order, and giving the tags to the exhibitor when he brings in his exhibit. She also summarizes the judges books, figures and premiums, and prepares a list of exhibitors and amounts due so that the treasurer can write the checks. As soon as this list is prepared and totaled, the Agricultural Agent okays it and the Senior Fair Board Treasurer writes a warrant for the full amount which is deposited in the name of the Class "L" Treasurer. The Treasurer then immediately writes the premium checks and distributes them to the exhibitors. The Treasurer is selected so that she can succeed or be advanced to the Secretary-ship the following year, and one of the better superin - tendents is advanced to Treasurer. Owing to the fact that the Secretary's activities take place pretty largely before the fair opens, or at least the first day, and the Treas - urer's activities the latter part of the Fair Week, they work together. That is, the treasurer helps the secretary make entries, tags, etc. and the secretary assists the treasurer in making cut and delivering the checks. This helps considerably in that there are at least two familiar with the books, entries, etc. and then too the treasurer, who carries over the next year as secretary, is familiar with the program. Because of their make-up nature of the work to be done and in order to give recognition to both boys and girls, the President and Vice President selected are boys and the Secretary and Treasurer are girls. The President and Vice President just naturally watch the activities of the boys and the Secretary Treasurer the activities of the girls. They council together, work out politices and problems, do a good job, and generally have a good time. We use a rather simplified system of books patterned somewhat after one of the systems made up by one of the publishing companies but alter this system to fit our demands. We use a common notebook, which we ruled ourselves, giving the exhibitor his number, address and the club to which he belongs, and a space for each of the 19 classes and a place for totals. This is our permanent record. From it we get our totals to present to the Senior Treasurer and the amount of each individual's check. From the time the entries are made from the entry blank until the check is written, everything goes by numbers, and there is no question of identity or a mix-up. The judges' books </seg>
            <seg id="p092">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE are mimeographed in the office, since only about a sheet for each class is necessary and, after the entries are made, these sheets are stapled to a piece of pasteboard which acts as a back to write on and another pasteboard is used for a cover. Copies of these are also on exhibit In so far as possible, we try to arrange the exhibitors in alphabetical order to insure ease of finding them in case we wish to do so. The superintendents have charge of all the activities within their department. In order words, the clothing superintendent receives the exhibits from each individual exhibitor of clothing, sees that they are properly tagged, puts up the exhibit, assists the judge by getting out the articles to be judged, and clerks the judge's books for the judge summarizes her books, gets the O. K. of the judge, and turns it in to the secretary. The livestock judging contest superintendent sees that the classes of livestock are selected by the judge or agricultural agent, sees that the numbers are assigned the contestants, that they have judging cards and pencils, sees that the rings of stock are in readi - ness collects the cards after the ring is judged, acts as secretary to the judge, and assists in summarizing the results of the contest The parade superintendent consults with the Senior Parade Superintendent arranges the order of the parade and seems that the exhibits are out in order that the parade goes off on time. The following program was carried out by the Junior Fair last year This program was made out a week or ten days in advance of t •„. , I** n ° Um^ WaS Eny eVent over flve mlMtes off schedule. I think that is a pretty good record and shows that the boys and girls can do the job. 4-H CLUB PROGRAM AT THE COUNTY FAIR Monday, August 20, 1935 2:00 p. m. — Judging Clothing Exhibits 2:00 p. m.— All non perishable articles at fair grounds Tuesday, August 27, 1035 8:30 a. m. — Judging Canning Exhibits 9:30 a. m. — Judging Secretarys' Books 10:00 a. m. — Judging Farm Account Books 10:30 a. m — Judging Fix-It Club Booths 11:00 a.m.— Judging Engineering Exhibits 11:00 a. m.— Inspection of Home Demonstration Booths 1:00 p. m. — Dairy Judging Contest 1:00 p. m. — Animal Husbandry Judging Contest 1:00 p. m. — Canned Foods Judging Contest </seg>

I leave the situation to you as to whether junior fair organizations are workable, whether they are worth while, and if they do not accomplish the purposes I outlined earlier in that they relieve the Secretary of considerable work, provide valuable training for the boys and girls, and give training for future fair board members, superintendents, and workers. </seg>

            <seg id="p095">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS And now" it gives me great pleasure to introduce to you a man whom we should call the main speaker of the morning. Your executive com - mittee decided that we would spend a little money this year in secur - ing an outstanding man from a neighboring state, who would bring to use something new in Fairs, and I am pleased to present this gentle - man, who is not only a Fair Manager, but happens to be vice-presi - dent of the Fair in Clay County, Iowa, who will give us some new ideas. He operated the largest County Fair in the world, with an attendance of 156,000 people last year, making a profit of $37,000.00. I think we are very fortunate in securing an officer from that fair to bring a message to us today. This man has also been for eighteen year a member of the Spencer Chamber of Commerce, and is one of Iowa's Master Farmers. I now present for your attention, THE NEW IDEAS IN PAIRS MR. ROY T. PULLEN, Spencer, Iowa I am delighted this afternoon to bring you greetings from the World's greatest County Fair, at Spencer, Iowa's Hvest little city. I will have to admit that I feel a little inclined to feel like the fellow who was asked one time if he had ever taken a tailspin in an airplane; he said no, but I was called on one time to make a speech, and I have an idea it gives a fellow about the same kind of a sensation. Making speeches is not my occupation, and in fact I feel about as well qualified to address a group of this kind as Mike proved to be as a messenger of comfort, when one afternoon he was out riding with his friend Pat Murphy, when in crossing a railroad track the car in which they were riding was struck by a passenger train and Pat was in - stantly killed; a crowd gathered around, gathered up the fragments of his body as best they could and started toward his home with him, when some one, realizing what a terrible shock it would be to Mrs. Murphy to have her husband's body brought home in that condition, suggested that someone go ahead and break the news as gently as possible; this Mike agreed to do; he went down the street with a long face and a sad heart, walked up to the Murphy home and rapped on the door, and as Mrs. Murphy opened the door he said, "Is this where the widow Murphy lives?" And she said "No sir, I ain't no widow"; and Mike said, "The 'ell you aint, just wait till you see what they are bringing home to you." In view of the extensive publicity given my appearance on your pro - gram I feel that it is a little bit like the farmer who was leading a small calf down the road one day when a business man came along In a big touring car; he gave his horn a couple of loud honks, which scared the calf, causing It to jerk loose from the farmer; it ran down an em- </seg>
            <seg id="p096">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OK AGRICULTURE bankment into a fence where it broke its neck. The man stopped his car, got out and came back to the farmer and said, "I am sorry; but I honked my horn, didn't I." The farmer said, "Yes, I tell you what I think; I think the matter was it was too big a honk for such a little calf." I appreciate your chairman's reference to me as a master farmer, but the facts of the case are, folks, I am just a common every day farmer, born on a farm, and have always lived on the farm, my oppor - tunity for an education being very limited I am a farmer perhaps not so much from choice as from circumstances; for when I launched my ship on the sea of fate it was generally conceded that the fellow who didn't have brains enough to do anything else was doomed to eke out an existence on the farm. When your program committee invited me to be your guest this af - ternoon and to say a few words from the standpoint of a farmer, 1 began to wonder just why they picked on me; and before I get through- - no doubt you will wonder the same thing. I accepted the invitation,, not because I felt that I could bring to your meeting anything of inter' est or benefit, but because I believe in co-operation, not only in the - community in which we live and the occupation in which we are engaged, but one community with another; I believe the word co-op - eration is the most overworked and abused word in the dictionary, yet I am firmly convinced of the possibilities of genuine co-operation; I believe the time to co-operate as the professor told the old maid when she asked him the best time to get married; he gave her the once over, and said, "grab the first chance you get". And I believe the kind of co-operation we must have is the kind the old Scotchman insisted on when he held his nose as he drank his liquor; when asked why he did that he said, "because if I smell it it makes my mouth water, and I don't want my drink diluted with anything." I believe gatherings of this kind are a splendid thing for they bring together representatives from various communities and give them an opportunity to rub elbows, compare notes, and discuss the problems that are of mutual interest, and thereby get a better understanding of one another's problems. I sometimes think we don't always take the thing the other fellow says and does the way he means we should. To illustrate I call to mind a beautiful young lady who was under the doctor's care and on a liquid diet; she had been begging for solid food for some time, but the doctor refused to give it to her until one evening he gave her a pickled cucumber and said, "Now, if you can keep that on your stomach during the night, tomorrow you may have some solid food"; the next morning the doctor asked her what success she had in keeping the cucumber on her stomach during the night; she said, "Well, as long as I was awake it was all right, but as soon as I went </seg>
            <seg id="p097">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIK MANAGERS V to sleep the blamed thing rolled off." Now folks, we are living this afternoon in this great Missouri Valley, the American corn belt, the most fertile and productive region of equal area to be found anywhere in the world, where agriculture is the hub around which all things revolve; it is the very foundation on which our cities are built, and if the foundation crumbles the entire structure is doomed. With the American farmer receiving a reasonable profit over the cost of production for what he produces on the farm, makes him the biggest purchaser of manufactured products, while without this purchasing power and his absorbing the output of the factories it will eventually result in a reduced output and the closing down of the factories, which would automatically result in unemployed labor, while on the other hand we farmers realize that well paid, permanently em - ployed labor, with a full dinner pail, is the farmer's best customer; so after all, folks, we are our brother's keeper, and on the success and prosperity of one depends the success and prosperity of the other. We have heard a great deal in the last few years about prospective legislation which might have a tendency to help stabilize and possibly increase the price the farmer receives for what he produces on the farm, spoken of as class legislation; my friends, the agricultural problem is not a class problem, but involves the very life and existence of Ameri - can institutions; the commodities produced on the American farm con - stitute the very fuel that keeps the wheels of progress turning. When the farmer has the money he is one of the best spenders in the world. I might cite an instance of what happens; recently a farmer hauled a load of hogs to town one afternoon for which he received ten cents per hundred weight more than he had hoped to get; when he got his check he said to himself I'll surprise the old lady; so he went to a clothing store and bought a whole new outfit, suit, shoes, hat, socks, BVD's and everything; he threw them in the back end of the wagon and started home; when about a mile from home he came to the river; he stopped, got off his wagon, went behind a clump of bushes, pulled off his old outfit and threw it into the river and watched it borne swiftly away by the current; he went back to the wagon to get his new outfit and discovered to his horror that it had been lost or stolen; he hesitated a moment, scratched his head, climbed up on the seat, picked up the lines and said "giddap, Dobbin, we'll surprise the old lady anyhow." If we should ask the average boy or girl of America the three most important factors in our present day civilization, they would answer, no doubt, the automobile, aeroplane and radio, or some of our great modern inventions; but the three greatest demands of civilization always were and always will be food, clothing and shelter, practically all of which are produced on the farm; there is no substitute for food </seg>
            <seg id="p098">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE or shelter; for clothing I sometimes think there is a question; I some - times think that Pat was serious when, walking down the street in New York city, he saw a large sign across the ' street that read, "Women's ready to wear clothes"; and he said "Begorra, its about time." We are told the price the. farmer receives for what he produces on the farm is governed by the law of supply and demand; this being true it would not be surprising if the American wool grower is facing disaster, for it' used to take the wool from three sheep's backs to clothe a woman, while today two silk worms answer the same purpose; in fact some women's clothes remind us of a barb wire fence by protect - ing the property without obstructing the view. What American agriculture needs today more than any other one thing is leadership; men and women qualified to solve their own prob - lems; through our boys and girls 4-H clubs on the farm we are trying to develop a type of American citizenship that will be a credit to the community in which they live, and will assume the leadership that will place American agriculture in the respected position among the great industries where jit belongs. On the shoulders of these boys and girls lies the hope and destiny of American agriculture. No normal parent ever becomes too old or too busy to take an interest in the welfare and progress of his children. I might cite the instance of an old man who had a son attending college; the son didn't write home very often and the father was curious to know what line of thought the son's mind was following, when he received a letter saying the son would be home to spend the vacation; he made up his mind he would try to solve this question, so in the reception room he placed a table; on the table he put a Bible, a five dollar bill and a glass of liquor; he said when he comes in if he picks up the Bible he will be a minister; if he picks up the bill he will be a banker; and if he picks up the glass of liquor, he's lost; shortly he heard footsteps; he hid behind a curtain; the son came in, looked around, walked over to the table, picked up the Bible, put it under his arm, put the five dollar bill in his pocket, and drank the liquor. Coming out from behind the curtain the old gentleman said, "a politian, by gosh". My subject this afternoon, "New ideas in Fairs", I discuss some - what reluctantly, for at Spencer our modesty forbids our boasting of our accomplishments; what little I know about conducting fairs I have learned as an insignificant member of the executive committee of the Clay County Fair at Spencer. I perhaps have no new ideas to offer, but possibly we do the old things just in a little different way from some other similar organizations. We have performed no miracles at Spencer, but we have built up an agricultural educational institu- </seg>
            <seg id="p099">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION' OK FAIR MANAGERS tion of which we are modestly though exceedingly proud; we have a board of twenty-seven directors, nine of whom compose the execu - tive committee, through which practically all our business is trans - acted. Every department of our fair is under the supervision of some member of the executive committee, and he, with at least two assistants, is responsible for the success or failure of his department; this gives him a feeling of independence and responsibility in which he takes pride. Fortunately we live in a community where the farmers and busi - ness men co-operate one hundred per cent in putting across our institu - tion. The secretary is the only member of our executive committee who draws any pay whatsoever, the rest of us buy our tickets to the fair the same as any disinterested person. We make an effort to keep our fair well balanced by arranging the exhibits and paying premiums in each department such that it keeps up the interest and justified patronage and competition in each de - partment. We believe it is hard to teach old dogs new tricks, so we give parti - cular attention to our boys and girls club work, and through our educa - tional features try to develop them along practical lines in the things we believe worth while. We co-operate with our schools, and they co-operate with us; the first day we make children's day, admitting all school children to the grounds free; by special arrangement with our concessions and car - nival, admission on children's day is five cents to all school children. One of our outstanding attractions is our township booth, for the exhibits in which the workers know as individuals they will receive no compensation; this exhibit causes friendly rivalry among the town - ships, attracting many rural people. Following the fair, in order to show our appreciation of what these workers have done, we give them a banquet, inviting in an average of six hundred farmers and their wives from all parts of the county; the banquet is served by the busi - ness and professional men of Spencer, and proves to be one of the most harmonious and enjoyable community gatherings it has ever been my privilege to attend. I ■ . ■ . ■ ■ We secure one of the best public address systems available, and broadcast our program not only to our paid admissions in the grand stand and bleachers, but in the infield, up and down the race track and out over the entire fair grounds. For the entertainment of those not able to secure seats or standing room around the entertainment platform, we put on a free marionette show three times daily out on the grounds. </seg>
            <seg id="p100">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE We buy entertainment that we believe will appeal to old as well as young; while some fairs, when they are hard-pressed, resort to home talent for entertainment, this we believe to be a mistake, as it will not attract from a large enough territory to make it profitable. We insist that all our employees be courteous at all times, regard - less of the circumstances. We employ judges whom we believe quali - fied, and then insist that the ribbons be placed where they belong regardless of the reputation of the exhibitor. With thirteen chain stores in Spencer, afternoons of our fair we find them all with their doors closed, their employees out to the fair rubbing elbows and getting better acquainted with their farmer cus - tomers. This is true with the exception of Saturdays, when we do not believe they would be justified in closing. Eighteen years ago we built a little wooden grand stand, race track and one stock barn, out in the middle of an oat field; during those eighteen years our fair has shown a nice profit every year but one, when we had a small loss; that year it rained every day, and on Thursday, our big day, with our grandstand all sold out about noon, the rain came down in torrents; we held a hurried meeting of the executive committee and decided to announce over the grounds that anyone holding tickets for the afternoon program could get their money back at the ticket office; this proved to be a popular thing to do. and for three months afterward we received letters asking for refunds on some of those tickets. We believe our success has been due to a large extent to our liberal ■and honest advertising. We have never knowingly advertised anything we could not produce. While we use considerable poster advertising •we have unlimited faith in newspaper advertising; we use 122 news - papers in the surrounding territory, giving them a paid ad for three weeks preceding the fair, and during the fair we give these editors and their wives a banquet, we supply them with complimentary tickets to the grounds, grand stand and the privilege of parking space; this is the only group that gets complimentary tickets free, and this we believe is well worth while. Our local paper gets out a special fair edition; the last two years we have sent out 45,000 copies of that edition sending them into the homes of every patron in 283 rural mail routes. Our problem has been not alone how to get the people to come to our fair, but how to take care of them when they get there, and make them like it. We have a half mile track around which is a concrete wall three feet high and eight inches thick on top of which is a three foot cyclone </seg>

Some people seem to think that if their neighbor or competitor in business meets with a reasonable degree of success it is due to some unusual good fortune, or luck if you please; but "ships sail and ships sail west, by the self-same winds that blow; it's the set of the sail and not the gale, that determines the way they go." The reason so many of our co-operative community undertakings fail is due to the fact that we lose our enthusiasm too quick- we start out with good intentions, but wind up much like the fellow writing the love letter to his best girl. He began, "My Dearest Angelina- I love you truly; I would climb the highest mountains. I would swim the deepest rivers, I would go through fire, to be at your side"- And down at the bottom he added, "P. S. I will see you tonight if it' don't rain". Then if we do meet with a reasonable degree of success we are likely to become conceited, a condition I want to warn you might be - come embarrassing. I speak from experience; quite early in my mar- </seg>

During the past few years the farmers, and the business men, as well as most institutions have passed through some unusual times and conditions; we have found ourselves confronted with perplexing prob - lems; in fact, we have found ourselves in much the same predicament as the buck private did during the war, when one afternoon he was out back of his little tent picking the cooties out of his jacket when the captain came along and asked him what he was doing; he said he was trying to get rid of them arithmetic bugs. The captain said Arith - metic bugs; now what are they and why do you call them arithmetic bugs? Well, said he, they add to my misery, substract from my pleas - ure, divide my attention, and multiply like hell. No agricultural community will become ideal until it arouses enough local pride to develope and cultivate a close, working relationship, per- Bonal contact and understanding, a realization by the business man that on the success and prosperity of his business to a large extent depends the prosperity and success of the farmer in his trade territory. A realization by the farmer that every legitimate business that is rendering a service to the community in which he lives is entitled to and must have a reasonable profit for that service rendered. I am not a banker nor a politician, but a victim of both; in spite of the conflicting platforms of our two major political parties it is a coincidence how their programs work out in harmony for the best interests of all concerned. For instance, the last few years of re - publican rule made monkeys out of most of us, and now the demo - cratic conservation program is planting trees for us to climb. We are living in an unusual age, when the height of too many American boys' ambition is to make the first installment on an eight cylinder car that will take him to the gymnasium for his daily exer - cise; when the modern girl adores the spinning wheel, but she wants four of them, with a spare on the rear; when most women like to be flattered, and the rest of them are the same way; when we men come home at night and the good wife meets us at the door with a kiss, and we don't know whether it is a kiss of affection or investigation. Now folks, at Spencer we do co-operate, not only in theory but in practice; after all, regardless of our occupation we are brothers under the skin; human nature is very much the same wherever you go; I think I can illustrate this in no better way than by reciting a little poem that goes something like this: </seg>
            <seg id="p103">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS I know two men, and know them well; Two men of equal rank; One runs an eighty acre farm, The other runs a bank; Both of them are honest men, Both are kind and true; And I'll be blest if I can see much difference in the two; For when they meet you on the street they greet you with a smile And friendly air that makes you feel so easy all the while; You feel as though you'd like to stand and talk a half a day, And when you go the stars of hope shine brighter on your way. Now folks, lest you should fail to get the moral of my strain, I'll add another line or two to make it good and plain; It's common sense and honest worth that levels state and rank. And makes the chasm small between the plowshare and the bank. Now folks, it's not my purpose this afternoon to try to give you a lot of advice; had I done so I would have expected to meet with about the same results as a fellow who lived in a certain community and de - voted most of his time to giving advice to his friends and neighbors. Finally he became seriously ill, and his doctor advised him that he had but a short time to live; so he made up his mind he would leave a parting word to those he left behind. So he bought a lot in the cem - etery, on which he had erected a tombstone, and on the tombstone he Inscribed these words: "This is to people passing by; where you are now, there once was I; Where I am now you soon must be; so then prepare to follow me." A few days after his funeral a group of high school boys was pass - ing through the cemetery; attracted by the unusual inscription, they read it carefully, after which one of them took out his jack knife, and down below he scratched these words: "Where you are now I wish you well; be it up in Heaven or down in Hell; But to follow you we'll not consent, until we know which way you went." This being my first visit west of Omaha, as I drove into your beau - tiful city yesterday afternoon I was wonderfully impressed with your ribbons of paved highways, beautiful boulevards, lovely homes, and magnificent capitol building. I was taught as a boy to think of Ne - braska as 'way out west' where a homesteader went into his little in - land country store and told the storekeeper he wanted a slab of bacon; the storekeeper said, do you want a little slab or a big slab; and he said ■"Give me the biggest slab you've got; I've eaten so darn many jack rab- </seg>

In offering an apology for the time I have taken from your other - wise interesting and profitable program, I feel a good deal like the young lady who had been escorted home for the first time by a certain young man; the young man was somewhat bashful, and when it came time to go he didn't know what to say; after careful consideration, he said, "You won't tell anybody I brought you home tonight, will you"; and she said "You needn't worry, I'm just as much ashamed of it as you are." I thank you. PRESIDENT JOHNSON — This has surely been a treat to us all; I am sorry we did not know until Mr. Pullen was through that he has 240 miles to go home this afternoon, and has to leave at once. We would like to have an opportunity to ask him some questions, but find it will be impossible for him to remain for that. MR. E. J. MITCHELL moves that the convention extend a vote of thanks to Mr. Pullen for his splendid talk, and also that it be the sense of this meeting that it should be given publicity in one of the Lincoln papers. The motion was seconded and carried. PRESIDENT JOHNSON made announcements regarding the eve - ning and tomorrow's program, also regarding the banquet tickets and program, which was seconded by a few remarks from Mr. Purcell. They also expressed the pleasure of the officers in seeing so many new faces among those present, and upon invitation to those in convention for the first time to rise, a large delegation came to their feet and were greeted with the words "New members brings new ideas, and we are glad to have you here." MR. M. E. CADWALLADER, Chairman of the Resolution commit - tee, presented the following resolution: RESOLUTIONS It is in a spirit of helpfulness to the Nebraska State Fair that we offer the following Resolutions: </seg>
            <seg id="p105">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS 1 — WHEREAS, we believe it would be a benefit to the Nebraska State Fair to have it managed by a man having technical Fair manage - ment experience, WE THEREFORE RECOMMEND to the Nebraska State Fair Board that the Fair be managed by a special manager who shall be elected yearly by the Board of Managers, and shall not be a member thereof. We further recommend that the salary of the State Fair Manager be such as to attract a man of the needed training and experience. We further recommend that Article Nine (9) of the Constitution and Article Five (5) of the by-laws be amended to embody the above ideas. We further recommend that a new Article, named number six (6) be added, which shall define the duties of the Manager. We further recommend that the duties of the Secretary be only those of recording secretary to the meetings of the Board of Agri - culture and the meetings of the Board of Managers, and that he be made a member of each group. We further recommend that his salary be made to conform with those of the other members of the Board of Managers. 2 — WHEREAS the date of this meeting conflicts with the National Western Livestock Show in Denver, we recommend that the next ses - sion of the State Legislature be asked to change the date of this meeting. 3 — WHEREAS, Article 1, Chapter 2, 2-101 and 2-102 Compiled Statutes of Nebraska 1929, prescribes as follows: 2-101 — Annual Meeting, Locating State Fair. There shall be held at the capital of the State, on the third Tuesday in January of each year, a meeting of the State Board of Agriculture, together with the president of each county society, or delegate therefrom duly authorized, who shall for the time being be ex-officio members of the State Board of Agriculture, for the purpose of deliberating, and consulting as to the wants, prospects and conditions of the agricultural interests through - out the State. And at such annual meeting the several reports from the subordinate societies shall be delivered to the president of the State board; and the said president and delegates shall at this meet - ing elect suitable persons to fill all vacancies in the State Board. The president shall also have power to call meetings of the Board when - ever he may deem it expedient. 2-102 — Officers. The officers of the Board shall consist of a presi - dent, vice-president, secretary, and treasurer, and such others as the Board may deem necessary. They shall be elected at the annual meet- </seg>
            <seg id="p106">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ing of the Board, and shall hold their offices for the period of one - year, and until their successors are elected and qualified. The Board shall determine by lot the time that each member shall serve, so that the term of service of one-half of the members shall expire annually on the day of the annual meeting." AND WHEREAS it has been the custom of the president to ap - point four men, who in addition to their own number shall constitute the Board of Managers of the Nebraska State Fair, "WE THEREFORE RECOMMEND that these four men be elected by the delegates in the annual meeting as required by law, and that Article 6 of the Constitution be corrected to comply with the law. (Signed) M. E. CADWALLADER, G. E. CODINGTON, E. M. BAUMAN. MR. CADWALLADER — These resolutions are not complete; we - expect other resolutions. PRESIDENT JOHNSON — The Resolutions will be laid over for consideration at the evening meeting, after the program. That will be the ruling of the chair. If there is any discussion on the Resolutions it will come at that time. MR. E. P. NOYES brought greetings from former president Otto Pfeiffer, together with his wishes for a successful session. A DELEGATE — Outside of the program I think we should bring out what is in our minds and discuss those things; that is the way to get benefit out of the meetings. MR. E. J. MITCHELL — It seems to me if this resolution is laid over until 9 or 10 o'clock tonight it will not give us time for discussion. It is a very important matter and should be gone over thoroughly. It is early now, and why can't that be taken up now for a few minutes before we adjourn and then again this evening. PRESIDENT JOHNSON— When I ruled to lay this over until eve - ning I had in mind that it was near 5 o'clock. If it is the sense of this convention that they wish to enter into the discussion of this matter now, it is all right with me. I am at your orders, and am willing to stay here as long as you wish. MR. MITCHELL — Personally I would like to hear a little discussion right now. MR. CHAS. GRAFF — I move that this Resolution be read once more at this time. </seg>
            <seg id="p107">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS The motion was seconded, and vote being taken, was s declared On motion of Charles Lemly, seconded by Howard Gray the con - vention adjourned until the evening session at 7:30. EVENING SESSION— MONDAY, January 20, 1036. Cornhusker Hotel The evening session of the twenty-seventh annual meeting of the Nebraska Association of Fair Managers, was called to order at 7-30 o'clock by President Johnson, who said: The first speaker on our evening program is a man whose hobby is agricultural exhibits. It is good for everybody to have a hobby, and if you have ever seen his exhibit at the Nebraska State Pair, you will know that this is more than a hobby, it is his business. For many years exhibitors from all over Nebraska have tried to bring an exhibit that would be better than this man's exhibit, and at his County Fair in Douglas county, his exhibit is wonderful. It is worth a trip to the Douglas county Fair just to see that exhibit. Last fall I was doing that Fair, and I don't know how many varieties of corn he raised on his 80 acre farm that was matured at Fair time; the rest of us never have but one variety matured. This gentleman always sends the first matured corn to the State Fair, and I know you will be glad to hear from Mr. William Steyer, of Florence. AGRICULTURAL EXHIBITS WM. STEYER, Florence ■Mr. Chairman, Friends: In taking up this topic— Agricultural Exhibits— I must warn you that it is bound to be, more or less, a personal talk, for I have lived and labored for the Douglas County agricultural Exhibits at both State and County Fairs for many years. During that time there have been a .great many changes and some experiments. Some of these changes have been good — others — not so good At the State Fair, we have discarded the old idea of large and miscellan - eous exhibits and adopted the small multicolored, specialized booths; with central ideas, and with open class competition put on the side - line. Where the trend has been to improve quality, to plainly and truth - fully label products for the information of the attending public, and •to enlighten them with authentic information regarding special ideas— •those are good steps forward. But where the color of crepe paper </seg>
            <seg id="p108">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE and the way it is arranged scores too high, in comparison with the quality and arrangement of the articles required to be shown — that constitutes, to my mind, at least, — a step backward; for it leaves the exhibitors disturbed and resentful and reluctant to enter the next year's contest. Each exhibitor has his own ideas regarding artistic colors and combination; some, with faith shaken by previous failures, hire com - mercial decorators, and then cannot see wherein the winning booth is superior. The quality and arrangement of the products is given sec - ond place in their regard, by the importance of crepe paper. At our Douglas County Fair, we have solved this problem by uni - form decoration of all exhibitors' booths under the plan and supervision of the Superintendent of Agricultural Hall. This leaves the question of artistic display to be decided by quality and arrangement of products alone, and focuses attention upon the exhibits. Now, do not get the idea that I am opposed to artistic display. I am strongly for it. I most emphatically stress that, in order to make a good showing, all exhibits must be placed so as to bring out the beauty — the good points — either by harmony or by contrast. They should make such a striking and satisfying picture of the plant possibilities of our fertile soil that even a careless one-looker will be, impressed by it. That is the reason that much thought should be given to achieve a proper back-ground or setting. Not long ago my attention was called to an item in a farm paper, written by a professor of an Agricultural college, wherein he stated that some of the county fairs were paying out too much money for non - essential agricultural products. He proposed that more premium money should be paid to stress standard varieties of grains and major crops. My idea on that subject is this: Nebraska is a large state with a wide range of climate, soil and moisture conditions. What succeeds in one section may not be adapted to another; the major crop of one section may be distinctly minor in another. The premium list should be expanded to take care of this situation. And other varieties of lesser value should be included by way of contrast, for comparison is the most forceful way of demonstration. I am afraid too many fair board managers and those who advise them think of agricultural exhibits in terms of grain and forage only. They are apt to make sly and mocking allusions to the vegetable ex - hibit as a "pumpkin show." But the exhibit, as I see it, is not for the benefit of fair boards, exhibitors and specialized farmers alone. Its great purpose is to show the fertility and resources of our county and our state and to interest the general public in the same. A large number of those who visit our fairs are much more inter- </seg>
            <seg id="p109">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS -ested in seeing varieties of vegetables and plenty of them, than they are in looking at sacks of grain and stacks of corn that all look alike to them. Sit In a booth at the fair, day after day, as I have done, and you will be surprised at the interest shown; the comments made; and the in - quiries for this, that, or the other new creation they have learned about from their neighbor or thru newspaper comment on some agricultural station experiment. It seems to me that the fair is the logical place to show the results of these experiments. Several years ago, when we used the old method of county collec - tive exhibits at the State Fair — you remember — when we showed as many varieties of grain, corn or any other agricultural product as we could obtain, a college professor came to the Douglas County exhibit and asked, "How many varieties of barley have you"? At that time, if I remember correctly, we had about 32 varieties. He said, "There aren't that many, are there?" Now, the fact was, we had obtained most of our barley seed samples from the Nebraska Agricultural College, so we asked him, "How many varieties have you planted this year at the college?" He replied, "36". "Well, then, wouldn't it be possible to have 32?" Every year we are paying out large sums of money for experiments and trials of new varieties. How will they get before the farming public and their merits discussed, if not at the fairs? And if the results are not worth the trouble of exhibiting, why waste time and .money continuing these experiments? This brings to my mind an incident that occurred at the last State Pair. After the judging of the county collective exhibits had been com - pleted, and the awards had been made, one of the judges came to me and said, "Can I ask your opinion on these exhibits?" I answered: "Sure, go ahead." He then asked, "What is your opinion on this first item — Lot I — where it says, '25 samples of corn and potatoes; not more than 20 samples can be of one crop'?" I said, "Well, my idea is that it should read '25 samples of as many different varieties.' " "That's my idea exactly" he agreed. "It is an easy job for an exhibitor to bring down 20 samples of Reed's or Silver Mine, or Mahogany Flour corn, or 16 samples of Cobbler potatoes, etc., as some do. It doesn't show the effort and the thought that an exhibit does that is made up of many different varieties." I would also add that the varied exhibit has a better educational value and is more interesting to the majority -of visitors. I suppose that because I have always been a market gardener, or truck farmer, I am apt to put a good deal of weight upon the importance •of the vegetable display; especially upon the showing of new vegetables </seg>
            <seg id="p110">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE or Improved types of the old ones. We have to pay attention to both novelty and quality if we are to succeed in the truck-farming business on the Omaha market, for competition is keen, many products are im - ported and new things are appearing. And when we see these things, experiment with them and learn of their commercial value, it seems only logical that they should have a place at the fairs, where people - primarily interested in raising farm products congregate. Of course I realize that we who till the rich alluvial soil of our Missouri river counties have a decided natural advantage in the production of mar - ket vegetables. But many of them could be raised in other sections and there are some, important in the diet and profitable as crops, that I have never seen included in any premium list. Take last year, for instance, when I was getting ready for the fair. One of our gardeners came to me and said, "Bill, let me bring you a good sample of Chinese cabbage." I replied, "No, I have some of my own." He insisted, "but mine is much better." I answered, "I know that, but mine is good enough as I only need it for count." He ex - claimed, in surprise, "What! Is there no premium on that?" and I said "No". And it really was no wonder that he was astonished for there is a great demand for this particular vegetable on our market and it ordinarily commands a good price — selling from 50(? to ?1.25 a dozen, depending on quality. I could mention other products of like merit and I believe that as they are developed and their worth proved, they should be given a place in our premium lists. House wives are especially interested in the newer articles and inquire into their uses and the methods of preparation. We, in Douglas county, have been criticized by some fair boards for paying too much and having too many premiums, but I want to tell you that that is what makes an agricultural exhibit. Of course, in our county, there are many truck farmers and we realize the importance of this industry. Many of those who pass through our gates during fair week are visitors from our county seat, Omaha, and they do not know much about farming. They are more interested in the products they can use in their cooking. Flowers and fruit also interest them greatly, and as all of these are displayed in our Agricultural Hall, it is usually thronged with appreciative and critical visitors. We have, in our Douglas County Fair, adhered to the old state fair plan, that is variety and plenty of it. So our hall is filled with the many products of the garden and farm and we have an abundant, instructive show. Visitors express their delight in remarks of "Wonderful." "Why I didn't know we raised that here!" "This is better than the State Fair", and so on and so forth. What sweet music that is in the ears </seg>
            <seg id="p111">NEBUASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS of any exhibitor or fair board manager! A gratifying bit of appreciation for the effort expended. As we still use the old score card in our col - lection exhibit and pay so much per point scored, our exhibitors are kept interested, and bring in their best products and their novelties The result is that our agricultural exhibit is on a par with all the other splendid displays at our fair. I think that all fair boards should encourage bigger and better agricultural exhibits by paying a fair premium, putting more varieties in the premium list, and revising these lists from time to time to in - clude worthwhile new creations. Fair board managers should also remember that agricultural products are not grown and prepared in a few weeks time. They take months of careful planting and planning So the fair board should get the premium lists out in plenty of time— or at least get our advance sheets containing information on Agri - cultural Exhibits, so that those interested may know what to raise and have time to prepare exhibits worth showing. You can not expect an exhibitor to raise and prepare a varied and complete exhibit without some compensation for doing so If the premiums are worth working for, you will encourage this man or that man to bring some products he has that he considers exceptionally good And, being interested, he will come to the fair to see how his compares with others, and how he comes out in the placing of his exhibit. He will discuss it with his neighbor, and that man, too, will in many nstances spend a day or two at the fair. So it goes, in an ever increas - ing circle. I think this is one way to create a larger interest in the Agricultural exhibit. In my experience in going to some of the county fairs, as a judge in their agricultural department, I am surprised to see such small exhibits —so few varieties— and so very few entries in a class. But, after look - ing over their premium lists, I am no longer surprised, for I find one or at most two, places on an article, with a 25? premium. You can not expect anyone to take the time and trouble to raise and prepare an article for that small sum. Such premiums are no incentive to good exhibitors and are apt to result in slip-shod, scanty exhibits. Some will say, "Well, we don't require a very large sample for an exhibit, so we don't pay much for premiums." They get just what they pay for. If they paid larger premiums they could demand larger samples. I think that a sample of carrots, parsnips, beets, turnips onions etc., should consist of one peck, or at least % peck, and should be exhibited in uniform containers furnished by the fair board This would do away with samples being brought in shoe boxes, cracker boxes, market baskets, or what not— which makes for an untidy exhibit. In visiting with some of the people, while judging, and asking </seg>
            <seg id="p112">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE them why the small exhibits, they will say — and rightly so — "Oh, heck! It don't pay." You see, an agricultural exhibit is not like an exhibit of poultry or livestock. When the fair is over you still have your poultry and livestock, undamaged, but the Agricultural Exhibit, which is largely of a perishable nature, is of no use at all, when it has stood around in the heat and the dust, for the duration of the fair. So it must be thrown away — a total loss. If you look at it from that angle, you will understand why I insist that larger premiums should be paid for perishable articles. '.. . I have endeavored to show you that Agricultural Exhibits should have a three-fold value: First — They should be of interest to the public by their artistic display and educational value. Second — By their power to attract and hold the attention of visitors, they should have a value to the fair management in increased fair at - tendance. And Third — They should return to the exhibitors a monetary value that will repay them for time and effort expended in raising and pre - paring their exhibits, and that will also encourage them to come back in the succeeding year with bigger and better showings. It is my sincere wish that we might all have such good displays at our fairs next year that we can say, with pardonable pride — to those about us — "We live in a splendid section of the country. Come on to our fair! Take a look at our Agricultural Exhibits and see what our soil can produce!" By working together, with intelligence and harmony; with each one striving to do his full share of his particular part of the job, we can attain the goal of worth-while, paying Fairs. PRESIDENT JOHNSON — We thank you, Mr. Steyer, and I am sure Mr. Steyer will be glad to answer any questions that anyone may care to ask of him. We will be glad for a few questions. The most educa - tional meeting is the one where questions are asked and answered. If there are none we will pass to the next speaker on our program. It has not been the custom, in the last few years at least, to have a lady on our program; our executive committee, and especially Mr. Matzke, and Mr. Marshall, of course fought for that very hard, and I gave in, as I always do, to the women, and it is now a great pleasure for me to present to you a lady who has done wonderful work at our State Fair; she has had charge of the Fine Arts department.

            <seg id="p114">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE and makes it possible for the boys and girls to have this great advant - age? You all know the answer. So when you think of Women's Exhibits I hope you will not think of just a few select groups, for as a matter of fact the women have a part in every department of the Fair, if they are not always the exhibitors. Every Fair board should have one or more women on it. Every group to do its best work should have both men and women to help in its planning and management. Some say that loyalty has gone out of our lives; that people used to consider loyalty a virtue when they needed and were dependent upon one another, but today when rugged individualism is such a vir - tue they need not be loyal to anything, not even to church, let alone a Fair; but no place that I know needs loyalty more than Fair Man - agement, to themselves, their county or state, and then the loyalty of their community to them. This loyalty, or co-operation, we might call it, will be more fully developed by putting women on the Fair boards than in any other way. In all departments of the Fair promotional Fair work during the whole year is needed. Granted the County agents and Smith-Hughes teachers do a splendid piece of work; but if each county could have some person to make the proportional work of their fair their own particular job, it would help all the exhibits. A few weeks ago we were visiting in Custer county. We were in a home located about two miles west of Callaway; my friend showed me a beautiful hand-woven quilt or counter-pane that had been given her by her mother, an heirloom and a treasure in the family. She asked if I thought it would even be noticed at the State Fair. I told her it would indeed, but why not send it to her County Fair first, that the women of her county might have the benefit of seeing something so lovely. She replied that she had talked to a lady at their fair one time about it, but they didn't have any classification for anything like that. Now all superintendents should help in this promotional work, should help arouse interest in their departments and get in touch with people who can help make exhibits that are worth while; they to meet at precinct and district schoolhouse meetings or programs at some time during the year to help arouse that district to Fair interest. Also the heads of the departments should stimulate both the women and the men to show better exhibits when Fair time comes. This brings me to what I consider the main objective of any Fair. I place it here in what I have to say because it needs the set-up I have given you to make it possible. I believe it was Mr. George Jackson, long the Secretary of our State Fair Board, who coined the phrase, "Make the Fair Educational". While I am like the man who says </seg>
            <seg id="p115">NEBRASKA ASS&lt; (CIATIOX OF FAIR MANAGERS "Thems my sentiments", I was interested in finding that two-fifths of those addressed in our Extension Department of the University, where people may attend the University by mail, were on RFD routes. Also over the radio one can study French, Spanish, German, English and History for credit, to Bay nothing of Music Appreciation, Fine Arts, Home Decoration, Art of well dressing, and cooking schools. Does this mean anything to you? It does to me. It means that folks want to learn what they dont' already know, and to improve the simplest of their every day routine. I can remember well, and perhaps some of yo"u can, too, when going to the International Livestock show in Chi - cago was only something to wish for, and seldom realized. Now many folks go where they can see what is best, and compare their livestock with that when they get home. We send our girls and boys there, and they can even compete. I well remember the thrill Mr. Field and I had when one of our daughters was chosen, for her 4-H club work, to an honor trip from Lancaster county. That has made the big show very real to us. We listen to Farm and Home hour religiously at our house, over the radio, to hear the last word in farm organization, gov - ernment and entertainment. There again it is said that this program is demanded from its fan audience, to give the highest class music of classic and cultural type. It Is nothing unusual for us to see in Morrill Hall a group of school children from out in the state, enjoying with some of their parents and teachers and beauties of the Fine Arts treasured there, and the majesty of Elephant hall, one of the grandest and most complete of its type. Or to see many groups of club women, come from near and far in the state, enjoying the new capitol, there appreciating the highest type of fine art beauty. Don't you see that our Fair exhibits for women must do something to stimulate a higher type of work - manship, the desire not only to compare their work with that of someone else for recognition, but to get something there that will help them to do their work a little better. I have been pleased with the success of these points developed in our Fine Arts department. At the State Fair, when I have had the assistants and clerks note the constructive critic - isms given by the judges on a piece of work, then when the exhibitor came for her work, with the ever ready, "Why didn't I get anything," we could answer her intelligently, and show her why. This has built up our exhibit to the extent that work which was given no rewards was returned with the corrections. One instance, for three years the corrected piece was returned, and this last year the exhibitor carried away the sweep stake prize in the lot in which it was exhibited. Your judges should be the kind who can see a possibility in the work offered, then make her judgment a benefit to her exhibitors. Also the people in charge of exhibits should be interested in developing the work they </seg>
            <seg id="p116">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE are superintending, not just giving it three or four days' thought and work during Fair time, to really make a good exhibit. Every year we try to have some outstanding thing exhibited in our department. One year it -was a life sized portrait of a bride, an - other year a beautiful chair made of cattle horns put together with battered brass, in a lively design, with tooled leather seat. I got a newspaper reporter to give me a paragraph, (which is pretty hard to do for women's exhibits) as most of the publicity goes to the cattle, chicks, and 4-H; but after the little write up about the department and the special display came out in the papers, for the remainder "of the Fair we had folks from all over the state come especially to see the outstanding article. Then we found many folks interested in Fine Arts, that we had never contacted before. We had some twenty new exhibitors the next year, and their remarks, "I've a picture as good as that at home", or, "my neighbor has", brought their work to us for exhibition. Just so surely as we all crowd around to watch the beau - tiful horses on the Union Stock Yards team, and long to own horses like that, and try to build up our stock, so in every department we should have something outstanding to attract people and show them something to aim toward in the line in which they are interested. I wish there might be a link-up in the Womans department, especi - ally with the first premium articles from all the county fairs, with this work, say the pieced qiults, the first prize winners from all the coun - ties might be sent to the State Fair and exhibited and judged together, apart from the regular general entry of quilts; the county fair boards to pay the expense of transportation, and the state the premiums. What an interest that would arouse in the county as well as the State Fair. I want to try that in the Fine Arts department some time when we don't have to think so much about the premium money as we have the last few years. To prove this a little farther: Last year we had a quilt displayed that had 9,000 pieces in it; the design was exhibited in our department of Fine Arts, under designs for some specific article, and the beautiful quilt itself in the needle work department. There was so much interest in this one piece, and quilts in general, that a concession man trying to sell jewelry near this department asked to be moved somewhere else, because he couldn't attract people's attention from the quilts. The auto takes us to see all the oustanding things, so we are trained to expect something that we haven't seen before, when we go places. The Fair Grounds is no exception even among our most loyal sup - porters. For success we must bury the much adage "The Fair is just the same year after year." </seg>
            <seg id="p117">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS At one county Fair where I judged I was pleased to find how clean -and freshly painted the buildings were, where the womens exhibits were displayed. The surroundings were in keeping with the lovely things the exhibitors had brought, and plenty of clean paper was ready to keep them clean. Then again I was once in a county to judge when I saw a woman refuse to leave a lovely water color picture for exhibi - tion because it had to be stacked against the wall in a pile. Nothing was ready to receive the exhibits, and no one wanted to leave the things which they brought in the dirt and the unkept place offered them. I felt sorry for the superintendent; she and I got newspapers and laid things on them. One time while there I was told "I don't .see how you can tell which is the best in this old dingy place." The light was so poor. I'll just suggest to you that surroundings for any exhibit does more than can be measured to inspire folks to come and see as well as to exhibit. I believe woman are more conscientious in their exhibiting than they are given credit for being. They really believe that as exhibitors they are supporting the Fair. When the amusements are the type that take all the advertising and arouse all the interest, women feel, I have found, that their small part is not missed, because the exhibits are the second consideration. Then, too, there are sometimes things carried on on the Fair Grounds that they do not approve of, because they are what we have .always been taught they were the lowest in the scale, and for the dollars the standards go to the cheap things that women do not want to help build into an institution, to say nothing of having these given the chief ■ display space and thought. It has been hard, I realize, 'for all Fair managements these last few years. I know the women who are most interested in the exhibit side of the fairs are not the most amusement minded. But notice the group that listens to the band concerts and ■ extra nice features provided for the crowds in attendance, and you will find the majority are women. This year I have been in six counties in our state, including Lan - caster, and do you know that in none of these counties is there a special building or even a commodious room set aside for the women . and their comfort. We have women who come regularly every year to the State Fair with their families and bring their lunch baskets for us to keep in our department because there is no place for them except their cars, and many times they come inside the department and sit in the easy chairs we take out from home each year, and rest for an hour or more; they are too weary to start to look at anything after the long drive and the preparations for the day and all it has meant in time and . strength. Many times they have boxes of fresh flowers for the floral ■ display to arrange and get entered on time. We have a little room in </seg>
            <seg id="p118">REPOUT OF NERRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE which we keep a cot for tired folks, and especially for babies. Folks get so tired; women should have a comfortable place to rest. A woman on the board would care for some of these things, and this would help the women's exhibit a great deal. Now I have not even mentioned the prize money. There's a reason —First, because I think it is the least point to consider. Money could never replace any article displayed in most of the exhibits called Womens Exhibits. The money reward should be high in proportion to the work, originality and skill involved, regardless of the amount But the exhibit come first, and then be sure, whatever is printed in the premium list, whether large or small, that the premium is prorated fairly if it cannot be paid in full to all departments, and the women will not complain. In conclusion let me list in importance what I hope will be helD - ful suggestions: * 1 — Have women on the Fair Boards. 2 — Co-operation among departments. 3— Consistent promotional work in enlightening folks about what the Fair offers. 4 — Make the Fair educational. 5 — Something outstanding to see in each department. 6 — Neat display space, ready for exhibits. 7— Be mindful of the real objective of the Fair; not all for amuse - ment. ■ 8 — Have high type amusements. 9— Provide a comfortable place for the women who attend the Fair. Now let me wish for you all in 1936 the finest Fair you have ever held, with full exhibits, good attendance, and fair weather. And finally: "She seeketh wool and flax and worketh willing with her hands; She considereth the fields, and with the fruit of her hands she planteth the vineyard; She layeth her hands to the spindle and her hands hold the distaff: She maketh fine linen.

            <seg id="p119">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS ■ Give her the fruit of her hands, and let her own works praise her in the gates." PRESIDENT JOHNSON — It is needless to say I know you have enjoyed this paper; I could tell that by looking down through the crowd. I might say I know Mrs. Field's talk comes from experience, as she has been superintendent at the State Fair, for years, and she Is also a competent judge for any of your county fairs, and if you need a judge of any kind Mrs. Field can successfully fill the bill. Now Mrs. Field will be glad to answer any questions you may want to ask; if there are none, we will ask for the next part of our program. DISCUSSION ON EXHIBITS Led by STANLEY A. MATZKE VICE PRESIDENT MATZKE — After listening to that worthwhile paper by Mrs. Field, which the president says, Chet Marshall and I insisted upon, we have no apology to make for insisting that she be placed on our program.. If any good has come to County Fairs out of the depression it is in the knowledge that the success of our County Fairs is not necessarily dependent upon how much profit we have made, nor in how many people we have on our Fair Grounds, nor in how many amusement features we have in front of our grand stand. The realization has been forced upon us that the basis and foundation of a successful, worth - while County Fair is to be found in what I choose to call "Exhibitor Interest". If every year you find an increase in the number of exhibits at your fair, if each year you find more of your home county people interested in the exhibits on display, and if each year brings an in - crease in the quality of the exhibits and a healthy rivalry in the con - test for premiums, your Fair is a live and worthwhile factor in your county, and you will find that all the other departments of your fair will function in a successful manner. It has always been my opinion that if the exhibitor interest of any County Fair is what it should be that you need not worry about your "Grandstand Attractions", your "Midway", your "Gate", or any of these other activities which are in reality only means of building up exhibitor interest. In this discussion on exhibits I want you to bring out any questions in which you might be interested. I especially want to invite you men who are here for the first time today to ask questions that bring out those matters which will help your County Fair to more fully serve its purpose. Now I know you folks have plenty of ideas, let us have them. </seg>
            <seg id="p120">KErORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE A DELEGATE — In the 4-H Department, do they enter in the open class department? Do your 4-H entries compete in open class? A DELEGATE — Ours do to some extent. MR. MATZKE — They cannot enter the same entry in the open class. A DELEGATE — Ours have to pay a new fee when they enter the open class. MR. BELKA, CRETE — We have had quite a problem down there with our 4-H entries. The old exhibitors and some who have been coming for years refuse to come back if we allow the 4-H people to compete in open class. That is still a problem with us. A DELEGATE — That is the reason we let them bring in their animal, but we charge them the fee. MR. MATZKE — Any animal entered in the 4-H class and then allowed in the open class must comply fully with open class require - ments and pay the same fee, with us. MR. MITCHELL — We do the same thing in Thayer county; they must comply with all the open class requirements, and pay the open class fee. MR. MATZKE — I would like to have something more on this. If the 4-H people coming into the open class is scaring away the open class exhibitors, that is something that must be worked out. MR. CODINGTON, NEMAHA COUNTY — We allow the 4-H to enter in open class, but it must be a registered animal. MR. MITCHELL — That is the rule in the other classes. The rule we follow takes care of that. The animal must be qualified to enter. MR. MATZKE — If there are any county agents here, I would like to hear from them as to how they would like to have this done. I don't see any here. PRESIDENT JOHNSON — Mr. Frisbee, a State leader in 4-H club work, is here and I think he should be called upon and we would be glad to hear from him. | MR. MATZKE — We would be glad to have your opinions and ideas, Mr. Frisbee. . MR. FRISBIE — I came here to listen, and am anxious to hear what you have to say. I have an opinion of my own, and I don't know whether you care to hear it or nQt. MR. MATZKE — We do. . </seg>
            <seg id="p121">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS MR. FRISBIE — It seems to me it is a good thing to compare the quality of 4-H products and the quality of the open class, but I do think there is a possibility of being misunderstood where you have the entries in both classes; but I am not sure the Seward plan is the proper one? It is followed in a number of Fairs in a number of the larger cities. The big point is to have an understanding between the exhibitors of the two classes. I believe it will work out very nicely if there is an understanding. Another way a number of large fairs meet the situation is to allow the high individual in each of the club classes to enter the open class by meeting the requirements laid down in the open class. That does not clutter up the open classes with a lot of material that does not belong there. Just an example of how it works out. At the National Livestock Show this winter, an Iowa boy had two calves; one was inferior to the other. He wanted to be sure of winning in the 4-H class. So he enter - ed the good calf in the 4-H class, and entered the other in the open class. The calf he thought was the good one failed to win or to get even top place in its class. The inferior calf not only won the cham - pionship of its class, but became grand champion of the entire group. I think there is a chance for misunderstanding, and there should be rules in every fair to cover the exact conditions that may come up. I like to see the comparison of the club class with the open class, but let us be careful that the club folks meet all the requirements of the open class before they exhibit. Give them no special privileges be - cause they are club members. MR. MITCHELL— They must comply with the regulations in the premium list the same as any other exhibitor in open class. The other exhibitors do not like to see them bringing in a calf that has won in his department and putting it in his open class; they do not like to see a boy win in the club class and then put the same animal in the open class and compete for it there; but if they meet the requirements in the open class, then it is all right. MR. MATZKE — In Seward county we have the same plan. We have a one dollar fee, and they must meet all requirements. They must compete with the open class exhibitor in the same class. Now we would like to hear from the new men, ask a question, or give us an idea. What other exhibition problems do we have? Do the ladies have anything concerning the womens department they would like to ask or to tell about? Do any of you have any special de - partment that the rest of us would benefit by having discussed? MR. NEWCOMER — Do any of you have any particular problems, </seg>
            <seg id="p122">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE or anything you do that you would like to see us do the same way? MR. MATZKE— No, I don't think we have anything that I can bring forward. Does anyone have anything in the way of an idea on the matter Mr. Taggart so ably brought out this afternoon? MR. WELCH, SEW ARD— There is a question I would like to ask about your horse show. How do you handle your premium list for your horse show. Most of the premiums lists list only pedigreed horses, which are few in number. I would like to know how to handle that question. MR. STEYER — At first we showed just pedigreed horses, but now we have changed and put in a list of graded horses and mules, and it has created quite a little interest and we have quite good horse shows now. MR. MATZKE — Mr. Lemly, how do you handle horses up there? MR. LEMLY — We have grades, too. MR. MATZKE — How do you like it? MR. LEMLY — It is very satisfactory. MR. MATZKE — How much of a horse show do you have? MR. LEMLY — About thirty head and an equal amount of mules. We have grades and purebreds. We always have had a grade class along with the pure breds. A DELEGATE — We have a purebred class of Percherons, then a big class for geldings and young colts, grade colts. We are doing all we can for colts, and have special premiums; if the colt is a stallion they give a premium, and it works out very nicely. In our county we have no purebreds. To my mind it is good to encourage colts; if a boy has a colt get him to learn all he can about it. MR. MATZKE — What is your first prize money on grade colts? DELEGATE — About $4.00 from the county, and there may be special premiums! from individuals. A DELEGATE — I would like to ask your premiums where you put in a complete classification of horses. Four year old, three year old, two year old, and what not. A DELEGATE — Our first premium is $10.00. MR. WELCH — Isn't there someone here from Falls City to tell us how they handle their grade horse show; they have one of the great- </seg>
            <seg id="p123">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS est in the state. They bring out hundreds with their grade horse show. MR. SHUBERT — We never had any real trouble at Falls City, but when we make up the grade classes somebody always has a good grade stallion and insists on showing it and when you get down to that class there is nobody much to show and it is a little bit hard to handle; but if you allow all other grades to come in invariably you will find an animal of that kind; they are a very good individual, but have no place in the horse world. That is the only bad feature we have run up against in making a show of that kind. MR. HENSLEY, MERRICK COUNTY — We work quite a little bit on pure bred. Anybody showing a grade stallion or a grade mare, it is all the same, we have a different age class. MR. MATZKE — All these ideas are helpful to any of us who have had trouble getting up a good horse show. A DELEGATE — We had a little difficulty a few years ago. Our horse show was nothing. Two years ago we had as good a horse show as there was any place in a county fair. We specialized in the colt, showing him in about five classes. Last year on account of the horse disease, they brought them and then took them home. MR. EBERS — I would like to ask how much difference do they make In the premiums offered, between purebreds and grades? DELEGATE — We usually make no difference. Around Cozad if there are thorobreds we never have them, they stay away. MR. STEYER — We don't make any difference in the premiums at all. We have very few of the purebreds and make no difference at all. i A DELEGATE — Our premiums run about one-third more on pure breds. A DELEGATE — Another question; do you have ten places or three places? MR. STYER — Our first premium is $10.00 and from that down to $3.00, graduated on down the line. A DELEGATE — We pay $12.00 on a pure bred stallion, and start in at $8.00 on grades. MR. MATZKE — Are there any other ideas you want to bring out? If not, I want to call your attention to the fact that at the end of to - morrow morning's session there will be another interesting discus - sion, and there are some interesting subjects to be brought out. </seg>
            <seg id="p124">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE "Exhibits open to the world or to County Only"; and "Entertaining Fair Crowds". Are there any other things you would like to bring out relative to exhibits? A DELEGATE— I would like to ask Mr. Styer about their premium list. MR. STEYER — On the Omaha market we have calls for every - thing you can find. We have calls for things that are in demand for home cooking, things that are not in the premium list, and should be. There are a lot of them. You will find that Douglas county has a more varied premium list than the State Pair. MR. MATZKE — Keep your premium list up to date. In the womans department we have each year canvassed the exhibitors and asked what is new in the stuff that is coming in and that they want to be on the premium list, keep it up to date and include those things that are in common use. MR. STEYER — We cut some things from our list every year, and add some new things every year. MR. MATZKE — Is there anything further along this line? I thank you for your co-operation in carrying on this discussion. In closing I will say let's remember that our County Pair is not necessarily in front of the grandstand, not in the treasurer's office, not in the live - stock barn, or the cow barns or the poultry building or the womans building, but in all of them, and anything you can do to bring a single person each year to an interest In your exhibits helps to build your fair into a worth while fair, and all the other things will follow. PRESIDENT JOHNSON— Speaking to the new members; we have not discussed, perhaps, as many things that you expected to hear; we have not discussed the free gate, the entertainment feature, or any - thing along that line. We have this year tried to hold our program to the exhibitors and the exhibits. Some of you might be disappointed; you might think we have left out some important parts of Pair work. We have; but every year previous these have been the main sub - jects and we thought this year we would make the exhibits the main subject of this convention. If there are no questions, we will come to the Resolution that was read and laid over for the evening meeting. Are there any questions you wish to ask? I wish all committees to have complete reports tomorrow morning. Our meeting of County Fair Managers ends tomorrow noon, but your meeting as a delegate does not end tomorrow noon.

            <seg id="p125">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS Now there was a Resolution presented this afternoon for discus - sion, and we will discuss that resolution at this time.

We want who - ever talks on this to give their names, and to come up here where the reporter can hear them, that we may get it down in print. MR. CADWALLADER — The Resolutions Committee has advised me to commence with Section 3 of the Resolution, which I will read first; it is the least debatable of the three sections. Do you wish to have the Resolution read? PRESIDENT JOHNSON — I believe that will be in order. Section 3 of the Resolution was read by Mr. Cadwallader. Whereas Article 1, Chapter 2, 2-101 and 2-102, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1929, prescribes as follows: 2-101. Annual Meeting, Locating State Fair. There shall be held at the capital of the state, on the third Tuesday in January of each year, a meeting of the state board of agriculture, together with the presi - dent of each county society, or delegate therefrom duly authorized, who shall for the time being be ex-offlcio members of the state board of agriculture, for the purpose of deliberating, and consulting as to the wants, prospects and condition of the agricultural interests throughout the state. And at such annual meeting the several reports from the subordinate societies shall be delivered to the president of the state board; and the said president and delegates shall at this meeting elect suitable persons to fill all vacancies in the state board. The president shall also have power to call meetings of the board whenever he may deem it expedient. 2-102. Officers. The officers of the board shall consist of a presi - dent, vice-president, secretary, and treasurer, and such others as the board may deem necessary. They shall be elected at the annual meet - ing of the board, and shall hold their offices for the period of one year, and until their successors are elected and qualified. The board shall determine by lot the time that each member shall serve, so that the term of service of one-half of the members shall expire annually on the day of the annual meeting. And whereas it has been the custom of the president to appoint four men, who in addition to their own number, shall constitute the Board of Managers of the Nebraska State Fair. We therefore recommend that these four men be elected by the </seg>

M. E. CADWALLADER, G. E. CODINGTON, E. U. BAUMANN. MR. CADWALLADER— The controversial part of the Resolution will come up under the part referring to "Officers". In further support of this point we have secured a legal opinion, which I will read to you, which is as follows: "That the Board of Managers was illegally elected, and are now act - ing without authority because they are officers as defined by the By - laws, whereas the Statutes of Nebraska provide that the officers shall be elected at the annual meeting of the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture. The Board of Managers were appointed by the President, when the law provides for its election by the delegates and members of the Ne - braska State Board of Agriculture. MR. CADWALLADER— Mr. President, I move the adoption of the Resolution. The motion was seconded. PRESIDENT JOHNSON— You have heard the motion, and It has been seconded. Are there any remarks? MR. BANNING — I don't understand why they refer to the managers of the last four years, when the statute has not been changed in the last four years. MR. CADWALLADER— At least since 1929 they have not been changed concerning this association. MR. BANNING — I don't think that section has ever been amend - ed. I don't think anything has been taken from it, or added to it. MR. CADWALLADER— The argument is beside the point. Re - gardless of how long the statute may have stood, if the procedure has been as outlined in the Constitution and By-laws of the Association, it has been in error and contrary to the law. MR. BANNING — I understood you to say four years. MR. CADWALLADER— Oh no; 4, 6, etc. I said. MR. BAUMAN, WEST POINT — If there are no other remarks, I ask for the question. </seg>
            <seg id="p127">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS MR. MILLER — The procedure has always been that they have been appointed, but confirmed by the body by motion duly made sec - onded and carried. They were announced and the motion was made that they be confirmed, and in my opinion that motion has always been carried. MR. CADWALLADER — The law states specifically that they shall be elected. The point of election and the point of the approval of the appointment are as far apart as sunset at night and sunrise in the morning. A DELEGATE — Has there ever been any controversy about this? MR. THOMPSON— I am not a delegate, but I certainly would be the last man to come up here and try to railroad any of my old friends off this Board. I don't want to go on the board myself. I believe you all recognize the fact that there is some dissatisfaction with the way the Board has been operated. I don't see why the old board should try to stick to technicalities. I can see the condition; every one of these men on this board has some ambition, more or less, to become President of the Board of Agriculture at some time, and I don't blame them for that. It is a worthy ambition. The President appoints these four men. I see some good in that. As president of this board I feel my responsibility and like to have men on the board whom I could work with and who could work with me. I can see where they might rule for appointing men for that reason. But with your president appointing these four men it makes it possible for him to dictate the board for the society. These men are approved and they all have an ambition to become members of that board and eventually president of the society, and naturally they will not do anything against the president or the powers that be. I do not see why the members of the board should object to conducting their business as the law requires. MR. BANNING — I don't think the Board ever intended to con - duct their business in any other way than as the law provides. I have been on this Board for twenty-five years, have gone through and had charge of every department in it. " I have not been on the board of managers for twenty-five years, but on the large board. I spent several years as treasurer, and set up the system they use now in the treas - urer's office, and I have come in contact with many men who tried to dominate that board; they spoke out in meeting and said what they wanted. I have expressed opinions myself, because I am convinced that is the way to transact business. Now if this is the law alright but I want positive proof that it is the law before I agree to take the other system. We may just as well get down to facts on this. The State Fair Board is not an easy place sometimes. Some members do have ambitions as you have mentioned; at the present time I am first vice president, but it will not damage or </seg>

If I have an opinion I want to feel that it is my independent opinion. This board, there may be some faults in it, but I cannot understand all this discussion that after 40 years we have suddenly found out that something is wrong; if we have been doing wrong we can correct our ways, but let us be 3ure first that something is wrong. MR. THOMPSON — I want to make myself understood. I believe - the board recognizes the fact as well as I that there is a tendency to - self perpetuation here. Now if that can be done away with in as simple a manner as that I don't see why we should have a lot of argu - ment in trying to defend our position. I read that statute myself, and while I am not a lawyer, and don't know that I understand English, I believe so far as that is concerned that Mr. Cadwallader read the statute just as it is. MR. BANNING — I do not say he did not read it just as it is. I will answer these newspaper articles, in the Nebraska Farmer, and I will prove what I say. MR. MITCHELL — I have been a member of this board, — not a director but a member, for some fourteen years, and I would like to know why, if the president makes this appointment of four men and they are confirmed by the body without opposition, that is not equiv - alent to an election. I can see, in State Fair work, why the president would have good reason to select the men who are to work under him, and have men like Mr. Banning, who has worked in every de - partment, than men who have had no experience or only in a limited way; I can see how we might, with the best intentions, put men on the Board of Managers who would be detrimental to the work. If the body elects a president, and he selects these four men, and they are con - firmed, it seems to me that is equivalent to an election. It makes it unanimous and I think is complying with the law. MR. GRAFF — Ladies and gentlemen: Some of you got in here this evening just as the gentleman was finishing the reading of the resolution, and I wanted a little more light on it, and perhaps I was chiefly responsible for the fact that the officers had some additional copies typed. I have looked it over carefully, and I can see where a man if he wants to be technical about the thing, can question the legality when the president appoints these four men and they are endorsed before the appointment is legal. You men in your convention select twenty - nine members in the first place. Your president then must take four out of the group of twenty-nine membership which you have elected, </seg>
            <seg id="p129">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS and the twenty-nine members of this State board is sometimes less than half of the number voting in the meeting of the State Board of Agri - culture. You represent the counties in the State of Nebraska, and I ask if you wish you can upset completely one-half of this organization. I am not a young man on this board, my friends; I am starting my twenty-sixth year as a member of the State Board of Agriculture. There have been men on this board many times who were not of the highest type, not everyone was best fitted to take a place on the board; but when you are working with men it is a matter of give and take, and I want to say as a whole the dominating faction has been of men that I have not been ashamed to be associated with. This is in the air; it is not new; we have gone through some per - formances in the State Board of Agriculture in the last 20 years. "A wheel within a wheel, and here is a little group perpetuating them - selves in office." There is nothing to it, my friends, there is nothing to it. Mr. Thompson and I have worked together in Cuming county for 40 years; I do not question his good intentions, nor his ability as a farmer and a citizen, nor his integrity; but when he makes the state - ment that there is a feeling of the people of the State of Nebraska that there should be a radical change made in the State Board of Agri - culture, — why — isn't it true today throughout this land, in the national congress and the state legislatures, it is the popular thing to jump onto any constructive legislation? You have perhaps heard the word about something being unconstitutional, especially this past season. Everything seems to be unconstitutional. It is too bad these fellows can't get to be president of the State Board of Agriculture, If they would like to be president. This brother has been a quarter of a cen - tury on this State Board. He has spent time and money, and I sup - pose was glad to do it, because he was working with real HE men, upstanding fellows. Show me a bunch any time that you will find like that. Why, bless your souls, men, I don't know but there might be somebody in this audience tonight that would find some fault with some state officer. We have also had occasion to read about the Supreme Court being criticised on their decision on the Triple A; and I am one of them. I have a right to my own opinion, and if it differs from that of a judge of the supreme court of the United States, it is just too bad for that judge, so far as I am concerned. The supreme court consists of five old fellows like myself; but are they not just as apt to err in their judgment as old Charles Graff? When a decision comes down from that great highest court of the land, from which there is no recourse four one way and five the other, isn't it possible that the four might be right and the five wrong? We know that is true. I recall the time a good many years ago when in the national congress, it took years to put upon the statute books a law that would bring in an income tax to take something from the man who got too much of this </seg>
            <seg id="p130">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE world's goods, and finally we got congress to pass a law, and It came before the supreme court, and when the time came for them to pass upon that law one of the judges was ill. And the four said the income tax law was constitutional and four said it was unconstitutional; the judge who was ill said he was not convinced that the law was con - stitutional and they had to sit again when the five judges were pres - ent, and they took a vote and it was four for and five against. One of the men who had voted that it was constitutional had changed his vote and voted that it was unconstitutional. Now we hear this that when a man finds that he has been mistaken he reverses himself. That judge had that defense, didn't he? He contended that he was mis - taken the first time; but now it is a question as to which time he was mistaken, the first time or the second time. We have these things come up, my friends. If there is anything wrong in the State Board of Agriculture, the most independent body I was ever connected with in my life, and I have been associated with various bodies in the state and the nation; I have found them a bunch of independent fellows who, if I differ with them, can have respect for another fellow's opinion and expect him to do the same. We must give and take. As long as a man expresses his honest opinion I should at least respect him in that, because I expect him to do the same thing with me. I don't see anything dangerous in the State Board of Agriculture, my friends. I remember some years ago we had a governor in Nebraska, and he didn't know very much mort! about the State Board of Agri - culture than some of these people, and he wanted to bring about a great reform in the State Board of Agriculture. He thought he could take that body and make a great political machine out of it; and he discovered that it was under a particular statute that had nothing to do with the governor. And that was a sad thing for the governor. The trouble started then and has been brewing ever since. I do not doubt there are men who would like to be president of the State Board of Agriculture. I remember a good many years ago a brother, who would have been president before this time, — they stuck him up for governor, and he was elected governor; and afterwards I heard him say that it was the one ambition of his life, that he would regret to the end of his days; he would have liked to be president of the State Board of Agriculture. Now they had taken it away from him. Those things happen. I see in your resolution, my friend, that you have in mind to get a manager, who has technical training and experience. MR. CADWALLADER — I rise to a point of order. We have not come to that resolution yet, or that part of the resolution. </seg>
            <seg id="p131">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION'. OK FAIR MANAGERS MR GRAFF— That is the resolution I am speaking of. As I under - stand it we are to have a highly efficient expert to manage the State PRESIDENT JOHNSON— Will you please confine your remarks to this particular section; that will be taken up later. MR. GRAFF— If I am to confine myself to that particular section I have not read it. PRESIDENT JOHNSON— There is a motion before the House on this particular section 3. MR. GRAFF— I beg your pardon; I may have something to say later. MR. BANNING — Hasn't that section been adopted before; is the motion on a resolution, or a section? PRESIDENT JOHNSON— It is on Section 3. As chairman I want to be impartial in this, and to handle it as intelligently as I possibly can, and not favor any group, or any man, and if I am wrong I want to be corrected; I have not had experience in these matters, but I want to do the very best I can. MR. THOMPSON— I would like to have Mr. Graff understand, it is not the purpose of anybody, so far as I know, to turn the present members out or to turn anything upside down. I certainly believe that would be a great mistake; there are a lot of good men on that Board; but I believe there is a chance of doing away with this senti - ment that I claim exists in the state. Only about two years ago a County Agent took it upon himself to nominate me for the Board. He did not consult me, and no one else did; several members of the board came around and told me how they would like to have me on the board, and one thing and another, talking over my head because I didn't know that anyone had nominated me. And finally an old friend came out and told me what had happened, and he said I want to talk to you like my own boy. He said I would gladly see you withdraw your - name rather than to see you get beat. He felt sure I would get beat; and I told him I didn't know anybody had presented my name, and I did withdraw my name. But it did seem strange to me that such a condition should exist. There are other men who have things to say who should get up and say them. While I would like to see Ne - braska have as good a fair as anywhere in the United States, it does not make much difference to me. Members of this board are friends of mine, and I have no ambition of my own, and I don't think anybody else has a personal grudge against any man on the board. I have been connected with these things long enough to know that it is im - possible to suit everybody. You are bound to be criticised if vou do </seg>

CADWALLADER — In presenting this resolution I want to say just a word. "It is in a spirit of helpfulness to the Nebraska State Fair that I offer the following resolutions," is the opening sentence, and nothing else enters into the resolution except that thought; we were coming with a constructive though; and we came with confidence, and retain confidence to build the Nebraska state fair to be a mighty fair such as we want it to be. We thought we had presented a construc - tive program. Numerous calls for the question were shouted. PRESIDENT JOHNSON — The question is called for; is there any other discussion? If there are no objections I will put the motion. A DELEGATE — Will you state the motion. At the request of the president Mr. Cadwallader read the motion to adopt Section 3 of the resolution as read. MR. NEWCOMER — I would like to hear the resolution or section read. PRESIDENT JOHNSON — I grant his request. MR. CADWALLADER again read Section 3 of the resolution. PRESIDENT JOHNSON — You have heard the motion; all in favor say Aye; opposed No. PRESIDENT JOHNSON — The chair is in doubt; will the Ayes raise their hands while the secretary counts. MR. GRAFF — I do not think we are in any position, to vote on this. I am not a representative here of a county fair, just one of the 29 members. I do not want to vote if I am not entitled to a vote. I have trouble enough without hunting for something. MR. THOMPSON — I think that is correct; only delegates are en - titled to vote; I think we should have a roll call. PRESIDENT JOHNSON — I am unable as chairman to know the hands that were counted, whether those people had a right to vote or not, because the Credentials committee has not reported. MR. BANNING — If this board has been going along wrong, who in the board is going to object to complying with the law? I am not, and I don't. believe anybody else is; I want to abide by that law. And if we are satisfied we have been going wrong, I am willing to get over </seg>

MORNING SKSSIOX — TUESDAY, January 21. 10SG Cornhusker Hotel The Tuesday morning session of the Nebraska Association of Fair Managers was called to order at It o'clock at the Cornhusker Hotel, by President Johnson. PRESIDENT JOHNSON — As you will recall, at the last annual meeting I appointed a legislative committee, consisting of Mr. Matzke, Mr. Russell and Mr. Steele. This committee, as you all know, had a hard year, and without any further preliminaries I am going to pre - sent Mr. Matzke, chairman of the committee, who will bring to you the REPORT OP THE LEGISLATIVE COMMITTKK By MR. STANLEY MATZKE I have remarked before that there probably never was a committee that worked harder and accomplished less than your legislative com - mittee. As soon as we were appointed Mr. Russell, Mr. Steele and I gathered together all the Pari Mutuel bills from other states that we could get hold of. We worked these over, studied them and compared them with the bill which was introduced in the legislature by the Ak- Sar-Ben interests. We conferred and advised frequently with Perry Reed, Secretary of the State Fair Board and on three occasion met with legislative committees. In our work on this measure we did not consider the moral issue involved, neither did we consider other matters contained in the pro - posed legislation except as it effected the interests of the County Fairs. </seg>
            <seg id="p134">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE 15OARD OF AGRICULTURE We found that other states permitting the operation of Pari Mutuels assessed taxes of from two to five per cent of the gross bets placed, in view of which we considered that the $200 per day and 15 cents per per - son tax that was provided for in the Aksarben bill was very low. However our efforts to make a change in this in the bill were fruitless, the Omaha boys being determined that the bill should be passed as originally •written. We also suggested that the money resulting from this tax should be paid direct to the County Fair Treasurers and not to the County Treasurers as the bill provided. We were promised that this change would be made in the bill by its sponsers but this was not done. The only change that was made in the bill, of any importance, being the allowing of the State Fair to have a Pari Mutuel meet at a tax rate of fifty dollars per day. The officers of Aksarben and others inter - ested from the Omaha standpoint stated that they were so heavily in debt that they could not open the track unless the bill passed as drawn, and they definitely promised that if they had a good meet that they ■would consent to a tax of at least 2 per cent of the gross at the next legislature. I am informed by Mr. Cullen, secretary of the racing com - mission that the Aksarben meet grossed over two million dollars this year, a 2 per cent tax on which would have provided about $15,000.00 more for the County Fairs than the present tax. Together with Perry Reed we ask for several changes having to do with discipline of jockeys and officials but these changes and suggestions were not incorporated in the law. One of the few pleasant things concerning our fight was the full and wholehearted response we received from the County Agricultural Societies. When ever we needed a crowd in Lincoln they were there. The committee having charge of this bill was dominated by the enemy and it was almost impossible to get a hearing before the committee. They would set the hearings only a few hours ahead so that we could not get our people there. Joe Steele carried the matter to the floor of the house and was successful in getting a hearipg set for about 30 hours ahead. We got busy on the telephone and had representatives from about twenty counties in the state capitol when we found that ■without notifying us the chairman of the committee had called the meeting off "and most of the members of the committee had gone home to Omaha. We spent the afternoon standing around the capitol with our thumbs in our mouths not knowing where to go or what to do. Joe Steele got the house committee to give us a hearing with the result that the leader of the Aksarben forces made use of the opportunity to insult and ridicule the County Fair men who were there, which the 'Committee seemed to enjoy. Your committee made four trips to Lincoln on legislation other than the Pari Mutuel matter. Each time we had a good delegation from the eastern part of the state appearing on behalf of the County Fairs - ■ </seg>
            <seg id="p135">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS at committee hearings. It has been the committee's attempt to aid in the passage of such legislation as would for the most part be for the benefit of County Fairs and the State Pair. We are sorry that we have not a more encouraging report for you, and we want to heartily thank those counties which on a moments notice flocked down here to work for the benefit of our Agricultural fairs. I want you to ask questions. Many of you dont know any more about Pari Mutuels than we did a year ago and we desire to let you in on the lessons we have learned. In our handling of the Pari Mutuel matter the committee's attitude was not one of emnity toward Aksarben in any way. We desired to have as much tax money go to the benefit of county Fairs as possible, and in view of the other states taking a tax of from 2 to 5 per cent, we felt that 2 per cent was not an unfair tax. We still feel the same way, and in view of their promise that a two per cent tax would be agree - able after the first year we believe that this should be demanded this year. A DELEGATE — What was the gross? MR. MATZKE — Around 2 million dollars, possibly a little in excess of that, which at 2 per cent would have been $40,000.00 instead of $24,000.00. A DELEGATE — Free fairs; do they get any part of this money? MR. MATZKE — Yes, any fair that qualifies as a county fair gets this money. MR. MILLER — What will this be used for? MR. MATZKE — The law provides that it may be used for payment of Premiums. MR. MATZKE — Mr. Cullen, secretary of the committee, is here, and if you have any questions he will be glad to answer. He told me yesterday that I had convinced him of several things but he had never convinced me of anything. PRESIDENT JOHNSON — I would like to present Mr. Cullen; let us give him a good hand, anyway. Mr. Cullen was received with a hearty round of applause. MR. BAUMAN — I suppose the next thing would be to get these changes incorporated into the law. MR. MATZKE — These matters that were promised to us I think </seg>
            <seg id="p136">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE should be followed up. Another committee should be appointed to go ahead and work on that proposition. MR. BAUMAN — I move that a committee be appointed to try to get this 2 per cent from the Aksarben. PRESIDENT JOHNSON — I hear your motion; is there a second? I think it is perfectly in order. MR. BAUMAN — I think that committee might also be looking after the welfare of all bills that might come up that relate to the county fairs and the state fair. PRESIDENT — I had the same idea in mind, that this same com - mittee might work for the ensuing year. There might be a special ses - sion of the legislature a week or two before our annual meeting. I find it costs us quite a bit to educate this legislative committee. A DELEGATE — I second the motion, including that this same committee work for the ensuing year. PRESIDENT JOHNSON — If you are in favor of this same commit - tee be elected to work for the coming year, please say Aye. Opposed No. The motion is carried. MR. BELKA— Is there any legal way the county can apply this tax on the county grant? I had quite a time to get this $200.00. MR. MATZKE — The attorney general has written an opinion in which he states that this is a fund for the payment of County Fair Premiums and the the county treasurer is merely an agent, who re - ceives the money for the county society and if he refuses to turn over the money you can bring a mandamus action to compel him to pay it over; but what we crab about is the unnecessary element in their law which should be changed so the money should be paid to your County Pair treasurer direct. ; ■■ ;l MR. MARSHALL^ — In connection with this, I noticed in our County paper last week that our Fair Association had received $2200.00 from the county. Two hundred dollars of this was par! mutuel money, but the people of the county think that they paid taxes up to $2200.00 for the Washington county fair. The amount of tax money was $2000.00. It is unfair to the fair association to have the impression out that we were raised $200.00 on our tax money allotment. PRESIDENT JOHNSON — We would now like to hear a word from Mr. Cullen. j MR. CULLEN — Mr. President, County Fair Managers and Guests: </seg>
            <seg id="p137">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS I thank you for the opportunity to say hello to you all. I have had the pleasure of working with a number of you man - agers and feel that I know some of your trials. I am not here officially, as Secretary of the Racing Commission; I'm here because of my interest in the County Fairs, especially the livestock, the 4-H, and the racing end. I am glad to say that the racing was very well accepted at the County Fairs this past 'summer, and as a whole, the races helped to keep the Fairs out of the red. I was glad to be able to give Mr. Matzke the reports he has referred to and will be glad to try to answer any questions that you may want to ask me at this time and to give you any information at any time. There has been so many points discussed and so many questions asked from the floor that it is hard to know where to start, so I'll just start and if I don't, make myself clear, please cut in on me. The state's income from racing and its distribution seems to be of most interest. As Mr. Matzke has told you, the Commission col - lected $28,668.10. After paying the expenses, there was enough left to pay each qualified county $239.15 and still have the $5000.00 in reserve as required by law. Had this $5000.00 been divided, it would have amounted to approximately, $60.00 more per county. Of course, the commission had extra expense the first year of printing rule books, etc. There has been a great deal said about the state, or rather the County Fairs getting an additional 2 per cent on the turnover. That would be fine if it could be done, but if it is taken from the licensee, they could not afford to operate; if the 2% were added to the licensee commission, it would slow up the play. It has been said that in some states, the state receives 3 % % ; that is true but we must realize that the turnover in the Mutuels are many times that of the turnover in Nebraska. And naturally, the profit to the licensee is much greater, so that they can afford to operate on that basis as the percentage of expense to income is much less. As business men, you know that there is a fixed overhead in every business, sport or any other activity, and I think that most of you know that the fixed expense of the Ak-Sar-Ben is almost as much as that of some tracks that handle twice as much business through their Mutuel windows. </seg>
            <seg id="p138">KEPORT OF NEBRASKA STA TE BOARD OF A GJUCULTL-ffE I am sure that any licensee that operated la Nebraska would be s\a.a. to -pay more tax ml yo\x 4ou^\e their mutuel handling. We must give the licensees a chance to get set before we ask too much. One licensee, the Afc-Sar-Ben, pays most of the taxes in Nebraska, as Jess than $1000.00 ot the total collected was paid by County Fairs and the State Fair, and we want to remember that counties of less than 75.000 only pay $15.00 per day and the State Fair pays $50.00 per day and no ticket tax, while Ak-Sar-Ben pays $200.00 per day and 15 cents on each ticket or pass. If we should put a 2 % tax on all licensee, some ot our county lairs would have to pay three or four times what they now pay; this is also true of the State Fair. As you know, no one connected with Ak-Sar-Ben receives a cent of profit. What net profit is made is used to finance the stock show and the 4-H show. I think that the Horse Show can carry itself, but they must have money to carry on the 4-H work. And this work is foremost in the minds of the Board of Governors of Ak-Sar-Ben. I am sure that you will find the Ak-Sar-Ben crowd very fair minded and If you will give them a chance to get on their feet and get a little money to carry on their stock show and 4-H work that they will vol - untarily offer you more. As you remember, they did a great deal for the Fairs when they were racing before. I think that racing will be a great thing for Nebraska. It is bound to help the breeders and we should be able to raise just as good horses here as they do in Kentucky, Missouri and other states that are making a lot of money breeding thoroughbreds. Raising these horses means that the breeder will hire more men and feed more hay, grain, etc. The law requires that at least one race a day be run for Nebraska bred horses and last year Ak-Sar-Ben put up more than $12,000 in purses for these Nebraska bred horses and I understand that the amount will be increased this year. Last year there were days that the Ne - braska bred races could not be filled and Ak-Sar-Ben put up races for Nebraska owned horses so that the Nebraska men would get the benefit, and of course the Nebraska owners had the same advantage at the State Fair and thirteen County Fairs or Legion meets, and I think there will be more meets in 1936. I was very much interested in your discussion regarding new classes for your Fairs. From what I observed at the Fairs, I think you could have more horse classes; what about colts for 4-H boys, also more pony and saddle horses and thoroughbred colt classes as well as your thoroughbred and grade heavy horse classes? Ak-Sar-Ben had classes last fall for mares and sucklings and I </seg>

Mr. Matzke said his committee through Mr. Reed -wanted some - thing in the law about the discipline of jockeys, officials and Other minor matters. I think that these matters are very well covered in our Rule Book. It is much better to have these matters covered by the rules as they have to be made to meet conditions ot racing. The National Associa - tion of Racing Commissioners are trying to make rules as nearly uni - lorm as possible as it will make for better racing; for instance, if a jockey is ruled off for an offense at one of our County Fairs, he cannot ride in New York until he has a clearance, and I think you will agree that we can get better discipline along this line. These rules were discussed with Mr. Reed. I won't take much more of your time, but I want you to know that I will help you in every way possible. Those of you that will race this year for the first time may need a little help. If so, please call on me. Last year at some meets. I helped make up the races, ran the paddock and Jock Room, worked in the judges stand, then checked the Mutuels and we have a very good check on the Mutuels. I understand that some of you had trouble in getting your money from the County Treasurer. Only two cases were reported to the Commission and we at once wrote the Treasurer and they came through with the money. The Commission would like to have as many counties as possible get a share of this money and we ask that as soon as you qualify that you notify your county clerk, as he must qualify you to the Commission. I think every thing will run more smoothly this year. I thank you for the privilege of talking and will be glad to try to answer any question that you may want to ask. MR. MATZKE — "Mr. Cullen, you are the only person we have to look to, to know whether or not we are getting all the money to which we are entitled. Who checks up this 15 cents per person tax?" MR. CULLEN — "The only licensee we collect the ticket tax from is the Ak-Sar-Ben. They have turnstiles and I read each turnstile before the meet starts, then read them every day. We then check our readings against Cashiers' Receipts and collect the tax the following day. These readings and Cashiers' Receipts were checked by the State Auditor when our books were audited." MR. MATZKE — "But under this law, we are to get our 15 cents </seg>

CULLEN — "You can't get through the gate with a] compli - mentary ticket until you buy a twenty-five cent tax ticket — fifteen cents for the state and ten cents for the United States government. After buying the tax ticket, you pass through turnstiles the same as though you had a regular ticket. A general admission tax is twenty-five cents, a box thirty-five cents." / MR. MATZKE — "Was a ticket issued for that admission on each one of the tickets that was paid?" MR. CULLEN — "Yes sir." MR. MATZKE — "And you check back on those tickets?" MR. CULLEN — "Yes sir, and the government also checks back on them." MR. SCHULTZ — I move that the report read here be made a part of the record for information and reference.

Anybody who wishes the floor may have it whether he be a delegate from some county fair or a member of the State Board of Agriculture. MR.

I don't know where it has been lost, but it is pigeonholed somewhere and the present officers don't know where it is. MR.

MR. GRAFF— The president has just ruled that we would be entitled to vote. I am calling attention to the fact that this organiza - tion has always put a very liberal construction upon that title of county representative. At numerous times we have given a county representation here that failed for some reason to be here with their proper credentials; but this meeting felt that they were entitled to be represented in this convention, if they represent a county or district agricultural organization that has held a fair in the past year and in that event I believe we have always seated them in this convention We have people here this morning who are present but who do not have credentials to present, and I suggest that we do as we have done in the past. If you satisfy the president that your county should have representation here, we should give it to you.

PRESIDENT JOHNSON— Mr. Mitchell, do you have a report for the Grievance committee? MR. MITCHELL— The only grievance filed with the committee is from the Thayer County society, and that is in regard to the Scott Auto Racers in Kansas. Thayer County entered iuto a contract with the Scott Auto Racers, wherein they were to put on a race the first day of the Fair. The correspondence was favorable and advertising matter was </seg>
            <seg id="p143">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS sent, but when the time came the show failed to put in an appearance. The manager was there and he said he had eight racing cars for the afternoon, and there was but one, and we cancelled it, and lost the first day's attraction and told them there was nothing doing. The members of the committee decided that this outfit was more a gang of promoters than anything else, judging from the fact that four cars drifted in during the week, figuring that they would get on with the aggregation and get on the next program. These other men came in with their trucks, and it made a bad matter all around, and we felt it was due to us to lay the matter before this convention so they could protect themselves from a similar occurrence. And we drew up this resolution: RESOLUTION WHEREAS, The Thayer County Fair Association, of DeshTer, Thayer county, Nebraska, entered into a contract with the Scott Auto Racers, of Topeka, Kansas, dated June 2G, 1935, whereby said Scott Auto Racers, Ducky Scott, manager, agreed to supply auto races for the Thayer County Fair program in the afternoons on August 20 send. 23, 1935, and WHEREAS, said Scott Auto Racers failed to appear on said dates,, thereby damaging said Thayer County Fair Association, THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that it is the belief of this com - mittee that any Fair association entering into a contract with said Scott Auto Racers should require said Scott Auto Racers to file a cash bond with said Fair association, said bond to be forfeited if said Scott Auto Racers failed to comply with their contract. E. J. MITCHELL, CHAS. LEMLEY, HARRY C. BELKA. MR. MITCHELL. — I move the adoption of this Resolution. The motion was seconded, voted on, and carried. MR. J. F. SHUBERT — My name was left off the list of delegates, and I ask that my name be placed on the list of delegates to this meet - ing, from Richardson county. MR.

A motion was made, seconded and carried, that Mr. Shubert be seated in this convention as a delegate from Richardson county, as by mistake his credentials were not received by the committee. </seg>

Being seconded and voted upon, the motion was carried. PRESIDENT JOHNSON— The next number on our program this morning is labeled "Motives for County Fairs", and if there is anyone in our convention capable of handling that subject I believe it is the sentleman I am about to introduce. I am only sorry that this man left county fair work a couple of years ago. I can easily see why he would; a meal ticket is the most important thing in any line of work, and anybody who has been connected with fairs of any kind, especially county fairs, is always behind financially, but as Charles Lemley said once, when you get the Fair bug in your head it is hard to get rid of it; and I believe many of you who have been in Fair work for a long while agree with that statement. I never will forget a number of years ago when this gentleman was secretary of the Thurston county fair, and we were invited to Walthill for a banquet, and the main item on that menu was "Pole Cat Fricasee"; and whenever I think of that banquet I think of the main item on the menu. I now take great pleasure in presenting to you one of the out - standing Fair men in Nebraska, Mr. E. T. Winter, of Lincoln. MOTIVES FOR COUNTY FAIRS MR. E. T. WINTER That very flowerly introduction I have received reminds me of an incident last summer; I was driving along in Scotts Bluff county, and ahead of me I saw an obstruction in the road, I stopped, and then I saw it was a farmer leading, or trying to lead a calf across a bridge, And he was not having any success. He came to the car where I was </seg>
            <seg id="p145">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS sitting, and said I believe you can help me get this calf across the bridge and then you can proceed on your way. I said "What do you suggest". He said I will get the calf to run, and as soon as you think it is safe you blow your horn, and maybe we can get the calf across the bridge. I did that, and I came down good and hard on the horn and it let out a loud squawk, and the calf went up in the air and over into an irriga - tion ditch and was drowned. The farmer came over to the car; I felt foolish, and I probably looked foolish. He says "Our scheme wasn't so hot". I said I sounded my horn, didn't I? He said yes, that was a good squawk, and I guess the trouble was it was too much squawk for such a little calf. Gentlemen, I feel that way about this introduction. I think thfs - is the sixteenth meeting of this organization that I have attended. On', the second morning of this convention I know you people are not in' the mood for a long speech, and I believe you will bear with the brevity of this talk. When the secretary of the Nebraska Fair Managers Association be - came desperate for a speaker for this meeting, he telephoned me, and' I presume that his line of reasoning was that because I had tried for - nine years to manage a fair and then quit, that I was qualified to telL you just how a fair ought to be run. I am still very much interested in the county fairs of Nebraska. In fact one of them owes me quite a little money. When I received Chet Marshell's call I had my grip packed and was about to start for Chicago. On my way in to Chicago I wondered what I could say to this group that they did not already know that might be valuable in planning future expositions. An idea came ta me while in Chicago and the subject of this ramble is "Motives for a County Fair." The idea came to me while I was listening to a Methodist church bishop tell of a visit to missionaries in South American sent out from his church. The bishop asked one of his missionaries why he had become a missionary and the reply was that the man had taken up his work because of dried apples. It seems that this man, when quite a small boy had eaten too many dried apples. To top it off the lad drank heartily of water and as you know the dried apples began to swell. The apples not only began to swell but they kept swelling and soon the boy was in such misery that he began to pray. He told the bishop that at that time he promised his Maker that if relief from the dried apples was forthcoming that someday he would become a missionary — this the bishop learned was this man's motive for spreading the gospel in foreign lands. The man was not a good missionary. </seg>
            <seg id="p146">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Another missionary who had not been much of a success as such was asked why he had taken up the profession. The man said that he had been a farmer and one day while in the field the Lord spoke to lV° rth aDd PreECh -" ThG blshop told tha * »« that perhaps he had been a little too hasty and had he taken time to listen to the Loid repeat His command he was inclined to believe that he would have heard the Lord say, "Go forth and plow." A third missionary frankly told the bishop that she was in the l eC&amp;USe " WaS the ° Dly WSy P ° SSible for her to se * the world and that she always did want to go places and see things. The bishop's stories gave me an idea and I determined to try his line of questioning on as many fair managers and board members as I could contact from that day to this. The question that I asked these men and women was "Why do you have a county fair in your county'" I believe that the answers that I got afford in a large measure the an - swer to the question as to why some fairs are successful and others &lt;li*6 not. Not one of the people questioned replied that they put on a county lair for the purpose of making money. Pour county fair officials from four different counties gave what sounded like a one word answer. I think that the word is spelled d-a-m-f-i-n-o. Those four fairs are in financial difficulty but I am not going to try to tell you whether they did not know why they should try to continue with a fair after or before they got into financial dif - ficulty. Maybe they knew of no reason for putting on a fair after they ££ *n k StarlDg thCm ln thG f3Ce aDd maybe they into financial difficulty because they never knew why they put on a county fair. th ?% S6C r tary Said that he dld DOt kDOW Why they put ° n a *a«r but that they always had put one on. One director said that they put on a fair because it brought people to town and that the merchants in town liked that. The answers received from officials from some very successful fairs included : It's educational. It's a good advertisement for our county. It's for our own recreation and education. This last answer came from the secretary of one of the most suc - cessful small fairs in the state. This fair. I am told, has paid off ?4200 in debts since 1330 and has $1200 in the bank today. It is not located </seg>
            <seg id="p147">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS in a favored section of the state as since 1930 that section has had more than its share of drouths, floods and cyclones. A president of a county fair association said that they put on a fair in their county so that they could have horse races and a director from another county stated that putting on a county fair gave them a good excuse for staging a rodeo. One fair was put on as a means for have a home-coming. One of the best answers that I got come from the wife of a fair secretary. This little lady said that their county fair was put on to recognize the achievements of the people that lived in the county. She said that the only times that their fair went sour were the times that the fair management failed to realize that the fair was being put on for everybody's, not just for the management's personal pleasure. "When we started to put twice as much money into imported free at - tractions as we put into premium money our fair headed for the rocks," she said. "Our board of directors put $1200 into race horses year before last and a little over $400 into premiums. Still convinced that a good program before the grand stand would carry the fair through even though the exhibits were not on the grounds the board carried out the same policy this last year. The results were bad. Women par - ticicularly refused to bring in their exhibits for the small premiums offered and the gate just about paid for the attractions. It was no longer a fair that belonged to the people. Not enough of them had been recognized and the spotlight had been turned on very few of the home people." Had this particular fair given only ribbons for premiums and then put on a home talent program in front of the grand stand everyone would have been better satisfied, according to the lady who had the welfare of the fair at heart. I have often wondered why fairs in adjacent counties were often so different. I wondered why one county was getting the crowds and the other wasn't. I wondered why one county always had plenty of money to do things with and the other did not. What does it mean to the person in your county when you adver - tise that the county fair will be held on such and such a date? In one county it means that you are going to have a fair at which higher premiums will be paid on pumpkins or on a sheaf of grass than is paid on the best sample of wheat or corn. In another county it means that the same recognition will be given on a banty rooster or a pigeon that is given on a good Buff Orpington or a White Wyandotte. I have seen fairs where they paid higher premiums to the winners in the mutt .show than they paid to winners in the swine show. A six legged steer </seg>
            <seg id="p148">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE is often given the best spot on the midway while the best bull in the county is exhibited in an out of the way place in a tent or old building. Now that I am no longer worrying about balancing the budget of a county fair nor all of the other things that a secretary has to worry about, it is easy for me to give advice to you who have all of these things to think about. I do see, however, some real opportunities ahead. The Extension Service of the College of Agriculture, cooperating with the U. S. D. A. and the county farm bureaus, is launching a pro - gram of land utilization. It will be an immense undertaking and it is a program of interest to every farmer in the state. It will require some thought and study to make the county fair a part of this pro - gram or to make a part of this program a part of the county fair but it seems to me that the possibilities of this are as great as were those of tieing 4-H club work into county fair programs. This can take the form of Exhibits of new crops, tree varieties, soil erosion, control de - vices, wood lot plantings, new methods of cropping or processing of new crops. The old fashioned pumpkin show will not attract and hold attention. As I see it the fair that will live from here on out will be the fair that can change as fast as the very changing times. I don't know who started this thing of doing everything different and of breaking all precedents but I rather suspect that the family up north had some - thing to do with it. You know that the family in question completed a five year program in one year. The name is Dionne. Good luck. PRESIDENT JOHNSON gave an announcement for the "Bill Board" a publication to which all fair managers should be subscribers, and gave his endorsement to the paper, and to Barney Oldfleld as its agent here. PRESIDENT JOHNSON — The next number on the program will not be given by the man whose name you see thereon. And when I present the man who is pinch-hitting for Bruce McCulloch of Omaha, who is the editor of the Journal-Stockman, you will meet a man who, when we chose him on our program, we know could handle this subject assigned to him. Mr. McCulloch is sick, and is sending a sub - stitute and pinch-hitter whom I like to present to this convention, and when he gets up to speak he can look you straight in the eye. I don't have to look down on the bald spot on his head to see him. It has been my pleasure on two or three other occasions to present this gentleman, once at a banquet and one at a great gathering in Saunders county. I now present Mr. Gardner. </seg>
            <seg id="p149">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS LIVE STOCK EXHIBITS MR. CHARLES GARDNER \ '.■■■'. I do regret that Mr. McCulloch cannot be here this morning, as I am sure his eloquence would please you very much. But for enthusiastic interest in the subject, which I understand to be the value of exhi - bitions to the live stock industry, I defy anyone to be more interested than I am. | I cannot help but feel that I am talking on a subject that this group of men know more about than I do. They have been engaged in It for a long time, but it is up to me to mention something that will per - haps be of interest to some of the younger ones whom I am glad to see mingling in this group of old timers. I think you can really classify the exhibits in live stock into two distinct classes, the first being the professional group, the importers and the winners of pure bred livestock, and cattle, horses, or sheep. This group of course require livestock exhibitions in which to show their wares. The interest in the breeding of pure bred livestock, highly intensified breeding, would be lost except for the exhibitions at which they could display and show the progress they have made in developing and maintaining a pure bred strain. This of course is an expensive business and it requires men not only with a lot of money, but good sports, good gamblers, because it is a treacherous business and as I understand it there are not many of these exhibitors and keepers of real high bred animals. They want a place to show their products, and this is less expensive for them than any other media of advertis - ing. They show their product at the livestock exhibition at which breeders of various exhibitors of livestock meet and compare these different breeds and different strains and see what developments have been made as the least expensive manner in which they can investi - gate the discovery of what strains they want to follow in that parti - cular situation. If you please, take all the horses and substraet therefrom the vari - ous strains so that you will have the livestock which is of great benefit to the prairie farmer and others interested in pure bred livestock, whether it be scientific breeding or feeding. The other class of livestock exhibitor is the one in which we of this section of the public are most interested, and this is the class that comes from what we might call — inasmuch as it seems to be very prominent and popular at this time, the amateur exhibitor, who becomes good through showing at livestock exhibitions, beginning with the county fair, the State fair and the National exhibitions. I feel like ■ crying, sometimes, I am so interested in the amateur exhibitor. It </seg>
            <seg id="p150">REPOKT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE reaches to the bottom of your heart to follow these boys and girls. I miss It more now that I am out of the business, than anything else in connection with the business. I have had one or two interesting experiences. Year before last at the Harding Shorthorn week, they asked me to put on a big hat and get into the calf scramble. And while there a big fine looking boy came up and said "Hello, Mr. Gardner." I recognized him; he was a fat, roly poly boy, and he was exhibiting a calf. I had a calf in this scramble, and after that scramble was over that boy had my calf. He took it home, and unfortunately he lost the calf. His father came to see me and said he wanted another calf. He got another calf and last year took third place in its division. I bought the calf and we served it at the Fontenelle. I feel tied up to that work, and I think as we go along there are some men and organizations getting interested in this work. It affords a place where a boy can obsolutely seek his own footing and find out where he stands in the line of work he is following, calves sheep or swine, whatever it may be. In 1924 we were all down at Chicago, and Duncan Marshall gave a talk at the Annual meeting of the International Association of' Fairs and Expositions and on this par - ticular subject he said, one of the greatest value to him was the educa - tional point of showing the exhibitor just where he stood. As. a lad he said he took a two year old filley and he thought it was the greatest thing in the world, the nicest thing he had ever seen or owned; he had the prize fllley; and he took it to the County Fair, and he got third place; and that showed him that while this was the greatest in his mind, when it came into competition with other fllleys there were better filleys than his, and this created a desire to bring out some - thing that would win, and instilled in him that enthusiasm that made him go on and on, and he did win, and that created in him the desire to win whenever he could. So from that point of view it is an advantage to the amateur exhibitor to take his product to the county fair. If it proves to be a good product it encourages him, and if it proves to be not so good it creates, in him a desire to do better, and if he wins at the county fair he goes to the State fair, and that gives him a broader view, and he goes on into more intensive work, and he sees what others are doing, and it gives him confidence in himself that what others have done he can do, and he goes it in a big way and goes to the National shows. I knew one young man for six years who kept on his way, and a year ago he had the champion. I never will forget an experience I had at the State Fair. Seated with my good friend McLaughlin, we got in for the final judging of the product of our Japanese friend, Hitoshi Matustani, who was showing Hereford calves. There were five of each breed came in, and George sat down on a seat there so as not to be seen; I told him I will keep you posted. His boy was showing. </seg>
            <seg id="p151">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS and he wanted to see and hear. His boy didn't know he was there. So I saw them moving up and up the line, and I told him as they came, and they finally got him up to the top, and he won. Then they came up for the championship, and George sat down again and I of course could look out over the crowd, and they got him up to the top, and eventually I reported to him, "He is getting the purple ribbon"; and he ran out and grabbed his boy and there was great rejoicing. George and his boy had been working for that for a good many years. Of course the greatest thing in that exhibiting of livestock is the educational value. It absolutely shows a man or a boy or girl what is being done in the breeding and care of livestock, and they go to these shows or exhibits, whether it is the county, the State or the National show, and learn what enables them to correct errors they have made and to see where they have failed in one item and gained in another; and it is of value. I feel that these exhibits are as much a part of the institution as the grade school, for the farmer, the breeder and raiser of livestock, and that the exhibits are as important in his livelihood as the grade school. And I think that applies not only to the exhibit part of it, or the breeding of livestock; I think it is edu - cational to the extent that it teaches this man or boy or girl good sports - manship; that this is a business, and they learn how to lose, and how to win. I believe this contact with these young exhibitors will give the boys confidence and be a fine thing for the balance needed by the younger generation. I believe by mingling with the livestock breeders generally in the livestock industries, and with the County, and State and National shows, it has an educational value in that it gives the boy confidence and he is able to talk to his elders in a straightforward, businesslike manner, when if he were not trained through these exhibi - tions he would be more retiring and shrinking. And I think by getting into the carload and fat cattle exhibits that go over the country, they are extremely interesting to him and I believe he really gains a great deal by being able to show his stuff, and oftentimes he is able to move up into the profit class what might have been a loss by bringing his product up to where he gets a higher price. I repeat that I am sorry Bruce McCulloch could not be here, but I am glad to be here, and when I heard that Bruce was sick I got in my car and came down anyway. PRESIDENT JOHNSON — I am sure every Fair manager here has received a broader view of what this Fair work and exhibits mean from an educational standpoint and how to develop citizenship in the boys and girls. At this time we will take at least fifteen or twenty minutes in a discussion on the subjects shown in the program. We will take first the one </seg>
            <seg id="p152">REPORT OK NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE EXHIBITS OPEN TO THE WORLD OR TO THE COUNTY ONIjY Most counties limit their exhibits at their county fairs to the boundry lines of their respective counties; however, there are county fairs that are open to the world. Now in this discussion if you men will relate what you do in your county, and why you 'do it, I wish you would give your name and the county you are from, and speak up loud, not only for the reporter's sake but for the benefit of all in the convention, who want to hear what you have to say. I now invite any discussion on this subject. Try to be brief in your remarks, I do not want anyone to filibuster and have to call him to order. This is a testimony meeting. What is your idea on opening your exhibits to the world or closing them to outsiders. • . • MR. CEDAR — When we opened our County Fair fifteen years ago we opened it to the world because there were three or four b( ard mem - bers who had shown at the State Fairs in surrounding states and they said if we could not raise as good stock in Nance county as other counties did, we should not have a Fair. Later on came t le profes - sionals in livestock, and they would come in and carry off all tie money, and it retarded the livestock breeding in our county; also ve had an appropriation of county funds, and they said why appropriate this money to fellows outside the county. Now we make it strictly a Nance County Fair and do not invite any exhibits from outside tl e county. One year we had $215.00 for the sheep, and an outside man came in and carried away $170.00, and we closed the gates, and have onl; ' our own county products on exhibition. MR. BAUMAN, WEST POINT— We started by opening oir Fair to the world, and continue to do so. We have found that it created a larger interest and the people in our home county will strive to com - pete with the outsider and improve their stock by doing so. And whenever a professional wants to come in, and we do not like the way he handles things, we are filled up before he makes his entry next time and in that way we are able to keep our Fair open to the world. PRESIDENT JOHNSON — Mr. Bauman has brought out a good point; it creates an incentive in their county to do better thii gs. Who is next? MR. DAVIS, KEARNEY COUNTY — In regard to open &lt; xhibits, I will say a few words from the judging standpoint. I have judged some 200 county fairs in this State. I used to make fairs clear out to the coast. A county fair open to the world is where you get you: ■ co upeti - tion. We build up our fairs from an educational standpoint. If a boy comes in with an animal, I will take a little more time in thii morning with him and dismiss him in the afternoon so he can see the ifree acts, the young kids enjoy these as much as I do. When an amat sur comes </seg>
            <seg id="p153">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS in I take a little time, and with a few pigs or calves and explain to him why the difference in the judge's decision. We learn by seeing things done; we must see the article and see why it is being done. PRESIDENT JOHNSON — I am sure Mr. Davis speaks from experi - ence, and from the fair manager's point of view, to cater to your young showman in live stock or any other particular. I am sure all of you have had this brought home to you, that there is always some fellow who thinks his department is the only one on the Fair grounds. Mr. Steyer brought out that he thinks this agricultural exhibit is the only thing in his county; and a horse man thinks that show is the only thing, and the race horse man thinks nobody would be on the Fair grounds except for the races. Prom my experience I accept this; I cater to certain parts of the Fair more than others; I can't help it; all of you do, and others do. I go to see certain parts of the fair and certain exhibits more than others. But balance your program, as Mr. Davis suggests, and do not get it over-balanced in any one parti - cular. But keep a speed limit. Is there any other discussion? MR. COOK, BUFFALO COUNTY — We have a custom of allowing the counties adjoining Buffalo to exhibit at our Fair. We had a ques - tion come up this year that I want to ask about. It is possible for the county fair that is supported to a certain extent by the territory adjacent to it to go outside the county. We have men on our Fair Board from outside the county. I think this is important, as it brings in exhibits that stimulate other exhibits and an improvement in your showing. I would like to know what others think about it. PRESIDENT JOHNSON — Has that been practiced by any other county in Nebraska? MR. BELKA, SALINE COUNTY — We do not feel justified in ex - cluding people from our surrounding territory. There are farmers around us who are Fair boosters, and we take them in, but we don't allow them any official position on the Fair Board. They are spend - ing their money in our county and feel that they should not be excluded; two of them are superintendents of departments in the Fair. MR. CADWALLADER — There is a District Fair in the western part of the State made up of four counties, and each county has representa - tives on the Fair Board. I think that would answer that question. It has been practiced in Nebraska, and is still being practiced; all of those counties contribute money to support that Fair and they have officers on the Board of Directors in that Fair. MR. VANCE — I would like to ask this man a question; he says they have four counties; is this known as a district fair? </seg>
            <seg id="p154">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE MR. CADWALLADER — It is known as a district fair. MR. VANCE — You lose your appropriation then, from your county, don't you? MR. CADWALLADER — I don't know what their financial arrange - ments are. MR. MITCHELL — The question I would like answered is how the county appropriates the money to take care of that district fair. If we do that we lose our appropriation, and I don't know how we can finance a district fair. PRESIDENT JOHNSON — Can anybody answer that question? How can you get your appropriation for a district fair; do you know, Mr. Vance? MR. VANCE — I don't think we can get it from any tax fund, I think it would have to be just a donation. MR. MITCHELL — I have been at a district fair several times, and they have succeeded in getting an appropriation from the State legisla - ture; but a fair cannot function with an uncertainty of that kind. MR. DAVIS — At the time we organized the Adams County fair we wanted an interstate fair and we took it up with the Board of Agri - culture. We had to have the legislature appropriate for that because we would lose our county appropriation. There are three men in Kearney County who act as superintendents or advisers, and I don't think they make any difference in the appropriation, but we do not go outside that county. PRESIDENT JOHNSON — We are now going to spend a little time on "Entertaining Fair Crowds", as mentioned in the program. We could spend a whole session on that, as we have done in previous years. Who is the first speaker on that subject? I receive no response; it is too big a subject to handle in a few minutes. I might say that I have observed that what one Fair Board might do in a certain part of Nebraska, is pretty hard to get by with in another county. I have been at fairs where they filled the grand stand at 10 o'clock in the morning, and most of you feel that it is a hard thing to get it filled in the afternoon. Last fall I was down in Saline county, where they gave a banquet to the people who had been on the program there; they take those people from all over that county, and I was there and I enjoyed it, and I would like to hear a word from the secretary of that fair, who is a very enthusiastic Fair manager. Mr. Belka. MR. BELKA — I am not very well qualified to speak on that sub - ject, but we feel this way: Our county has a wholly free fair;' we pay </seg>
            <seg id="p155">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS no salaries; we go to the different towns and contact the people who are public spirited, the different groups who will accept the program for one day of the Pair. Each of these groups will have their followers. Our big day is Friday, and this year we had between 15,000 and 16,000 people there. This banquet feature is all the salary anyone connected with the Fair gets; we all pay for our tickets, and all seem to get the spirit and we are all pepped up to go next year. PRESIDENT JOHNSON — I am sorry to limit this to so short a time. This is the first session I ever attended where we have taken so little time for the entertainment and amusement features. Those are a part of your program also. Last year, an important point was the par! mutuel in county fairs, and I think this afternoon we would like to hear something from those who had pari mutuel in their fairs. MR. MATZKE — There were quite a few fairs that had pari mutuel betting, and we would like to hear from those. Who will be the first to, give their experience. MR. RUSSELL — We did not have it until this year, but we built a paddock and operated it in there. Some people were opposed to it, to start with, and after the first day they began to inquire about it. This all takes place inside the paddock and we allow no children in there, even if accompanied by parents. We had the police to keep them out. We did not make much money, but we paid for the paddock; I heard no criticism after it was all over with, and we are going to try it again. MR. LEMLEY — I wish instead of talking about what you made out of it, you would give us some idea of how the crowds were pleased with the entertainment part of it. Did it please your crowd? MR. RUSSELL — The way it was in Fillmore county, when it was finished everybody was standing up, wondering how it was going to finish. PRESIDENT JOHNSON — I know some fairs do not have a grand stand and are not interested in these subjects, but some fairs are in - terested. MR. GRAFF — It has just been mentioned that all the discussion we have heard on this subject this morning is relative to the dollars and cents. I wonder sometimes if there isn't something else that has a bearing on it. I would like to have these men tell me how it raises the morale of their people. I would like to have them tell me where it can be of benefit to a community of people, when the fathers and mothers are not allowed to take their own children to it on their fair grounds. God Almighty endowed people with human instincts. It is not fair for us to say, "if you want to throw your money away it </seg>
            <seg id="p156">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE is your business." Isn't it a fact that we have good citizens who have their failings like you and I, but perhaps in a different direction. They say a fool is easy parted from his money. I believe a county fair, or any other kind of fair, for that matter, should be conducted along lines such that you can take your children, and that you can turn your children loose on the fair grounds and know that they are not going to come home having picked up something which will do them no good in the future. It seems to my mind, friends, that there is much more involved in this matter than the dollars. If it is to be commercialized and is to be financed through such methods, then it seems to me it must come to pass sooner or later that the Fair is not following the purpose for which it was created. We have always prided ourselves upon the fact that these fairs were primarily educational; and secondly they were to serve in a social way. We go there and our minds are broadened along lines which are of benefit; and I think it is wrong to set up anything on the County Fair grounds, or even on the State Fail* grounds, my friends, that you are not allowed to let your young people go to. We have heard about livestock this morning from my old friend, Charlie Gardner and Mr. Davis, who both stressed the fact that in these fairs we must look in the future to the amateur, the beginner. As an old Fair man of long ago, I have said when a little group of exhibit - ors, national exhibitors and men who are onto the ropes, and other groups get together and go to the Fair Board to work out some arrange - ments whereby they can take every dollar in a class, the beginner does not know where to go, and he is the one we should always keep in mind in this work. This is a 4-H club or boys and girls affair; we feel proud of them for what they have done all over this land and we are striving to make them satisfied to live on the farm and take a pride in the things they are doing; develop their minds along the right lines; and then to take them to a fair, and you, with your aged spouse go into this place where they are not allowed to enter. They want to know what is back of that. The average normal American boy just feels a little bit queer about anything stuck up there where he is not let in. It looks to me that we must get away from that almighty dollar that we are striving for in putting on these fairs. There must be more to it than that, and if not, then I think we are not represented right before our people. I am sorry, Mr. President, that I have got to differ with so many of my old friends in the State of Nebraska on an important movement like this seems to be. I know I haven't got good solid footing on this prop - osition which went over so big it was almost unanimous, and I can see my good old friends on the Board of Managers of the State Fair today </seg>
            <seg id="p157">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS and what they are confronted with, and Imight say I am really glad that I am not on that Board of Managers, because I have felt I wanted to stir the thing up and raise hell about it. Let us be able to look our people of Nebraska in the face and let them know we are not forgetting the real purposes of the Fair. MR. THOMPSON, CUMING COUNTY — Mr. Chairman and Members of the Nebraska Fair Managers Association — I had no intention of say - ing anything, but when Mr. Graft said he had only one foot to stand on I thought maybe I could help him out a little. I believe I am not tak - ing an undue pride in the record our County Fair has had in the last few years. We have made money every year since we have operated, and everybody who has attended our Fair knows that no man needs to be afraid to take his wife and family anywhere on our grounds. There is nothing objectionable to be found. We will not stand for it. We try to make our Fair a home-coming affair, to make it an inducement for those in our county, and people everywhere, to bring their fam - ilies and have a good time. I realize as one of the Fair managers, that you have to have things to make money, you have to raise money, but I believe our record shows that you do not need to have things that are objectionable to anybody. Personally I don't see any particular harm in pari mutuel, at the same time I don't see why it should be necessary for any county or state fair to have that sort of thing to raise money to operate. It seems to me that if you have the sort of Fair that will justify support such as it ought to have, you will make money without all those things, and I don't believe in encouraging people to think along those lines when it is not necessary. Our Fairs are supposed to be educational; they have no right to exist for any other reason. And I venture to say if you do not have too many of these added attractions you can get your people inter - ested in things that are really educational without these sideshows, monstrosities and pari mutuel, to clutter up your grounds. At home we had a man who had two boys, and he put one into a pig club, and they went to the fair; and about the time the baseball games started this man said "I must go over and see about those kids; when they get the ball games started and one thing and another the pigs won't get the attention they ought to have. And he started out to find the boys, and when he found them he learned they didn't know there was a ball game on; they were so interested in showing these pigs they had all the enjoyment they wanted right there; and I think you can get the farmers to do the same thing, if you get them to con - centrate on the fact that you are now showing livestock of one kind or another, you can get them interested and getting their enjoyment out of things that are educational, and you don't have to have these other things. Do not have so many other things going on that the </seg>
            <seg id="p158">KEI'ORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE farmer does not have time to look at the exhibits. You must have some of these things, people demand some entertainment, but I do not believe it is necessary to go so far as many county fairs have gone to have a successful county or state fair. MR. MITCHELL — Personally I am opposed to this whole gambling proposition that is going over the country. When peri mutuel carried in this state it seemed to me just too bad. It let down the bars; con - ditions are not normal over the country, and the fair managers are forced by the general opinion of the public to resort to things that in normal times they would not stand for at all. This bad law legalizing gambling put it up to the Fair boards. People coming in on the ques - tion of amusements said "You have voted gambling into the state, why not let down the bars on the midway"; and they have practically forced the managers to accept amusements of a questionable nature. The same question as brought to the State Fair board. It Is just too bad to think that the people of Nebraska, which has always stood for education and the higher things, have come to a state where they will tolerate and wink at things that a few years ago they would not tolerate at all. I am glad I am not on the State Fair Board, but I agree that the dollar has forced them to do things they are ashamed of. We had ques - tionable shows on the midway; we had a Gypsy camp that was a dis - grace to the State of Nebraska; and the board was forced to do things that a few years ago they would not stand for at all. PRESIDENT JOHNSON — Mr. Graff and Mr. Thompson and Mr. Mitchell have a right to their opinion, and whether we agree or not with these gentlemen, the State of Nebraska has voted for it, and we have to make the best of it. We could discuss this the rest of the morning, but as chairman I will close the discussion now on pari mutuel, and at this time we will take up the election of officers. I am sorry to cut off this discussion, but will have to do it. I am sure these gentlemen have spoken their honest feelings and sentiments, and those are the sentiments of many, and they have been well taken, and we could let the other side, if you would call it that, take time, but we would accomplish nothing. I have enjoyed this discussion. We will now come to the election of officers. The first order is nominations for president of the Association of Fair managers for the ensuing year. What is your pleasure? MR. RUSSELL — I nominate R. C. Johnson for president. MR. MILLER — I move that the rules be suspended and the sec - retary be instructed to cast the unanimous ballot of this convention for R. C. Johnson as president for the coming year. </seg>
            <seg id="p159">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS MR. MATZKE — It has been moved and seconded that the rules be suspended and nominations bo closed and that R. C. Johnson be unani - mously elected president for the ensuing year. Is there any discussion? If not, all in favor of this motion say Aye, those opposed, No. The motion is carried unanimously. The secretary cast the ballot, and Mr. Johnson was declared elected. PRESIDENT JOHNSON — I thank you for your confidence in elect - ing me as your chairman for the coming year, and shall endeavor to do more in the coming year for the fairs in the State of Nebraska than I have in the past. Next is the nominations for vice president. MR. BELKA — I nominate Stanley A. Matzke for vice president. MR. WELCH — Moved that the rules be suspended, nominations be closed, and the secretary be instructed to cast the unanimous ballot of the convention for Mr. Matzke as vice president. The motion was seconded and carried, the secretary cast the ballot, and Mr. Matzke was declared unanimously elected as vice president of the association for the coming year. PRESIDENT JOHNSON — Next comes nominations for secretary - treasurer. MR. MIILLE — It is with pleasure I place in nomination my old friend Chet G. Marshall for the office of secretary-treasurer for the coming year. MR. NOYES — Moved that if there were no further nominations the rules be suspended, the president cast the unanimous ballot of the con - vention for Mr. Marshall. The motion was seconded and carried, the president cast the ballot and Mr. Marshall was declared duly elected as secretary-treasurer of the association for the ensuing year. PRESIDENT — I might say that I am more pleased than in being elected myself to have two men to work with such as you have chosen, and we can accomplish something, I believe, during the coming year. Is there anything further before the convention? If not we will proceed with our Resolutions committee report. MR. CADWALLADER — This resolution has been read a number of times before the convention. It has been debated, and a motion was made that it be adopted, and the motion was seconded. The motion was debated and we were up to the point where we were ready to take </seg>
            <seg id="p160">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE a vote. I will read this section 2-102 of the Compiled Statutes of 1929, which relates to the matter in hand. MR. CADWALLADER read the statute and also read section 3 of the resolution. As a supplementary part of the resolution we read an opinion that the Board of Managers has been illegally elected and are now acting without authority because they are officers as defined by the by-laws, whereas the statute of the State of Nebraska provides that the officers shall be elected at the annual meeting of the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture. The board of managers was appointed by the president, when the law provides for their election by the delegates and mem - bers, of the State Board of Agriculutre. The only question that enters in hpre is just whether we are going to comply with the law; and I reqvest that the question be submitted. MR. BANNING — The law as quoted by the gentleman is correct. I talked this morning to Deputy Attorney-general Ayres, and he says there is nothing that would bar the action that has been taken here, of pursuing the same course we have. But why come up here and raise a question about this? Why not bring it up in the meeting this afternoon and if the by-laws are not right submit an amendment to take care of it. There is no use resoluting for ourselves on this thing. Why not bring it up in the Board meeting this afternoon, and 1f you want the by-laws changed, change them. There is no reason why this has been done. This law was put on the books way back years ago and has been there ever since. I will leave it to you gentlemen to pass on. Many times you get men on this Board of managers who are merely a burden to us and they have been a draw back. If I am going to operate a business I want to pick at least a portion of those who are to help me from those who will co-operate with me in the business. And I want this same thing on the Fair board. I want to know why this has not been done in the past. I know it has worked out exceedingly well. If you should put me in as president of the Fair board, and give me a raw bunch of men to work with, I wouldn't have it for a minute. I know the idea is to let these men work through the different depart - ments of the Fair board and educate them to what is necessary. If you are going to be on the board of directors you will want somebody who is going to co-operate. I say take this up in the meeting this afternoon and do what you want to with it. MR. CADWALLADER — May I ask a few questions? MR. BANNING — Yes sir. MR. CADWALLADER— You said last night that this was the statute. </seg>
            <seg id="p161">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS MR. BANNING — I acknowledge it is the statute. MR. CADWALLADER — You said if we did not comply with the law, let's comply with the law. MR. BANNING — This way it doesn't get you any place when you pass it or reject it here, but bring it before the board meeting this afternoon and amend your by-law or whatever it is. PRESIDENT JOHNSON — I think the last way is the better, but if I am wrong I want to be corrected, that this is a resolution for the meeting this afternoon to take up. That is all it is, isn't it? MR. CADWALLADER — That is all it is. PRESIDENT JOHNSON — They will spend plenty of time on it this afternoon or tomorrow; and will we accomplish anything? MR. THOMPSON — I don't want to bore everybody, but I want to say something. Mr. Banning said this had been started years ago and nobody has found fault, and so far as I am concerned there would not be any objection to the plan, but we feel — not that we have any personal grudge against any member of the board, that we feel anything is being done that should not be done for the best interests of the fair, but we know positively that there is a feeling in the state that things are not being done in the way they should be done, and whether this is the best way or not we feel it is the law, and if we take this action at this time it will do away with some of that sentiment that there is a wheel within a wheel, or a self-perpetuating organization; and this is the purpose of bringing this before you at this time. MR. WELCH — I think there is a reason and a cause behind the resolution. Up until 1935 there was not an accusation of this kind to - ward the Board of the Fair Managers. I move at this time that the proposition be tabled so far as the County Fair managers are concerned, and let it be brought out and take its regular course in the meeting this afternoon. PRESTON BAILEY — A motion to table is purely a motion to table. I make the superior motion, that we adjourn. The motion to adjourn was seconded. PRESIDENT JOHNSON — In carrying this motion we are adjourn - ing our Fair Managers convention. Vote being taken, the chair was in doubt. PRESIDENT JOHNSON — We will take a rising vote. MR. NEWCOMER — Who is entitled to vote? </seg>
            <seg id="p162">UEPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE PRESIDENT JOHNSON — The chair ruled at the beginning of this meeting, according to the custom that has always been followed, that all delegates have a vote, and the membership of the State Board of Agriculture has a vote.

Mr. Biermann served as Association Vice-President from 1929 to 1935. </seg>
            <seg id="p165">WHAT OUR ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN DOING IX 1035 PRESIDENT, C. Y. THOMPSON, West Point The other day while cleaning out a drawer of my desk. I found a program of the first annual meeting of the Association of Agricultural Students, to be held in the Dairy Building at 9 o'clock. I might add that this was the only building at that time in which it could be held at the University Farm. Right here we find a little reference star and at the bottom of the page in fine print we read: "The Havelock car leaving the postofflce at 8:20 A. M. and 1:20 P. M., will be met by conveyances at Holdrege street, to take visitors to the farm." The date was Tuesday, February 14, 1899. It was on that day, as president of the Agricultural Students Association, that I had the honor of presenting Governor Poynter and Secretary of Agriculture, Tama Jim Wilson, to our student organization. This was probably the greatest event of my life, and one that I shall cherish as long as I live. So, you will see, I have grown up with this great agricultural college, and have been more or less active in the various phases of its activities. However, I can truthfully say, that of all the outstanding programs presented to us during the week of Organized Agriculture, none has appealed to me more, one year with another, than that ot the Nebraska Crop Growers 1 . We have six hundred |members and it is largely through their fine cooperation that the Agronomy Department is able to develop out - standing varieties of grains and grasses that are adapted to the various parts of the state. By certification under the direction of our organiza - tion, it is possible to maintain the purity of the various varieties. Our slogan is: "Good seeds are the foundation of profitable crops." However, when certified seeds are used, we are not only getting the advantage of the use of good seed, but we have eliminated the great cost of experimentation as well. It would be hard to estimate the losses farmers have sustained by experimenting with untried varieties of grains and grasses, but judging from my own experience, I know it would be enormous. Under the circumstances we can seldom afford to make the sacrifice, and there is no need for it, as that is one of the purposes of our experiment station. Among other things we certified several varieties of hybrid seed corn as follows:. Hybrid Xo. of Growers Xo. of Counties Ac-res Planted Nebraska 362 3 3 27 ' 2 Nebraska 238 G 4 72 if. Nebraska 252 .4 4 19 </seg>
            <seg id="p166">UEPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE We expect to have some very interesting discussions on hybrid seed corn later in our sessions, but I hope you will pardon me if I give the results of a little experiment of my own with hybrid corn to follow up what I have just said about losses sustained in raising untried crops. For the experiment I used three hybrids, one being the Nebraska 238 hybrid I produced from inbreds, furnished me by the station two years ago, and two open pollinated varieties. One open pollinated variety was Funk yellow dent raised by a neighbor, and the other was Krug yellow dent which I have raised for a number of years. I planted these five kinds in a field that was as nearly uniform as it was possible to get. To secure the relative yields, forty hills of each kind were picked and weighed. First, I weighed all of the corn and then sorted it as to quality as well as I could, with the following results: Comparative Yields — Thompson Variety Tost To'ol Y!eld Good Ears Fa!r Errs Nubbins Yield Variety I. 1 "- No. LK«. No. Lbs. Lbs. per Acre Funk yellow dent 41 39 23% 23 9% 8%~55 bu. Iowa 311 hybrid 39 20 11 31 12% 15% 48% bu. Nebr. 362 hybrid 39 42 23% 23 9% 6 48% bu. Nebr. 238 hybrid 49 49 31% 16 11% 6 61 V* bu. Krug yellow dent 44 42 28% 21 9% 6 59 bu. None of this corn was of excellent quality, but the Iowa 311 was especially poor. It was moldy and full of smut with hardly a good ear In the whole bunch. While it stood up better than any of the others, practically every ear was a "grinner" and stood straight up against the stalk with two or three inches of it sticking out of the husks. A neighbor of mine, who picks his corn with a picker and is inter - ested in hybrid corn primarily because it stands up, came over to see me about hybrid corn because he had tried Iowa 311 and was not satisfied with it. While I realize that in another trial different con - ditions might produce results entirely different, it is quite evident, that under the conditions which we had this year, the difference in results is so great that it cannot be overlooked. It is certain that if my neighbor had planted Nebraska 238 instead of Iowa 311 he would have raised more and much better quality corn than he did. Our secretary's report of the 1935 certified seed work gives the following summary. These varieties have all been tried and proven worthy of certification. </seg>

We believe it is money well spent to encourage college students and 4-H members to become proficient in judging grains and grasses. Consequently, we donated $100 to the College Crops Judging Team and $50 to 4-H Crops Clubs to help de - fray expenses to attend the Crops Judging Contests at the Kansas City Royal and the International Hay and Grain Show at Chicago. The Nebraska College Crops Judging team placed second out of five teams competing at Kansas City, losing first by the small margin of 1 Vz points.

            <seg id="p168">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Crops Clubs, with a view to promote production of these crops in the communities where they are tried. We issued and distributed the booklet — "Rules and Regulations for Certification and Recommended Crop Varieties for Nebraska." And each year we put out an annual report that is worth more than the cost of a life membership in the Crop Growers' Association. A single lifetime of farming in Nebraska has seriously depleted the soils of many farms on rolling land. More legumes and grasses will help to restore and conserve them. Owing to the fact that the drouth damaged or ruined many pastures in some parts of the state, it was deemed advisable to encourage the repletion of these pastures by offering premiums for a contest. To this end the Omaha Chamber of Commerce offered $1000 and the Nebras - ka Crop Growers $500. Our worthy secretary, P. H. Stewart, and Assistant Agronomist, Arthur Peterson, are largely responsible for the success of the contest, since it was they who planned and supervised it. On the evening of December 17th about four hundred farmers and business men held a banquet at the Omaha Chamber of Commerce. After the banquet the prizes were awarded. I am not going into the details except to say that Lloyd Nichols of Nemaha County won first and Joe Sedlak, Polk County won second in the temporary division. Jacob Saltzman, Fillmore County, won first and John Kollmah, Holt County, won second in the permanent division. The Omaha Chamber of Commerce showed a fine spirit of cooperation and it is hoped that we may be able to have an even larger contest next year. </seg>
            <seg id="p169">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION AN AGRICULTURAL ADJUSTMENT PROGRAM BASED ON PROPER USE OP LAND O. V. WELLS I. Production Planning Section, Agricultural Adjustment Administration We are now faced with the question as to what kind of an agri - cultural program we want, rather than with the question as to whether or not we shall have an agricultural program. That is, questions as to whether prices can be raised and incomes increased, as to whether agricultural well-being and commercial prosperity are inter-related, and as to whether farmers can and will cooperate in a nation-wide adjustment program have been answered by the organized effort to obtain agricultural adjustment which has been under way since 1933. Objectives of a Continued Program And in connection with the question as to the kind of a continuing program which is wanted, general agreement seems to have been reached with respect to at least one very important point. That is, we are generally agreed that if we are to have a continuing agricultural adjustment program that it should not only be designed to achieve and maintain the desired balance of supplies with effective demand but that it should also encourage good farm management and soil con - servation, or the proper use of land. I interpret the invitation to speak before this Association as one expression of this desire to work toward an agricultural adjustment program based on proper use of land. You will find that it is the goal toward which the several changes in the adjustment programs for 1936 are directed. And you will find it well summarized in the state - ment which was released by the President on October 25. The Presi - dent said: " A long time program is developing naturally out of the present adjustment efforts. As I see it, this program has two principal objectives: "First, to carry out the declared policy of Congress to maintain and increase the gains thus far made, thereby avoiding the danger of a slump back into the conditions brought about by our national neglect of Agriculture. "Second, to broaden present adjustment operations so as to give farmers increasing incentives for conservation and efficient use of the nation's soil resources". It is with this question of proper use of land, or soil conservation, that I want to deal this morning — with the need for conservation, with </seg>
            <seg id="p170">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE the extent to which proper use of land and agricultural adjustment are inter-related, and with the most effective means of obtaining a coordin - ated program which shall aim at both conservation and agricultural adjustment. n. Soil Depletion from Free Competition Why do we need to encourage soil conservation? To begin with, the effects of "free competition" on the use of land and on farm pro - duction must be considered. Even though it is to their long-run inter - est to conserve soil resources and stabilize production, when farmers have families to support, mortgages to pay off, interest and taxes to meet, free competition not only forces an increased acreage of land under cultivation but also forces more and more intensive culture of the acreage already under cultivation. With other things equal, this encourages over-cropping and over-grazing. As a result, free competi - tion in agriculture tends to discourage or work against soil conserva - tion. That free competition has worked in the manner just described is indicated by the estimates of erosion damage which have recently been made by the Soil Conservation Service. It is estimated that about 50 million acres of formerly good farm land has been essentially ruined so far as the production of cultivated crops is concerned; that another 50 million acres are in almost as bad condition; that the top soil from 100 million acres of land still in cultivation has been washed off in whole or in part; and that the soil stripping process is well started on an additional 100 million acres of cultivated land. These estimates only apply to good farm land which has been damaged by erosion, and do not take into account the wide spread erosion which is occurring over the vast grazing domain in the West, or the losses in soil fertility which are taking place on some of the better land due to over-cropping. Altogether, erosion and soil depletion are taking place to some extent on almost every farm in the United States, and the problem cannot be controlled by taking solid blocks of land out of cultivation. Instead, it must be met on each individual farm by an effort to obtain the proper use of land — by shifting badly depleted or steeply sloping land to grass, by the use of soil building rotations or cropping systems, and by the use of terracing, strip cropping, and other devices designed to retard or prevent soil erosion. That the need for some method of encouraging good land use is recognized is indicated by the increasing interest which is being shown in the development of an agricultural adjustment program designed to encourage the proper use of land, and by the manner In which farmers are agreeing to cooperate with the Soil Conserva- </seg>
            <seg id="p171">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION tlon Service in those areas where demonstration projects have been started. An additional recognition is to be found in the manner in which farmers have used the acreage adjusted out of corn, wheat, and cotton production since 1933. Altogether, about one-third of the contracted or adjusted acres in 1934 were used for the production of emergency forage, one-third were seeded down to hay and grass, and one-sixth were fallowed or used for weed control, and an equally good showing has been made in 1935. III. The extent to which agricultural adjustment and proper use of land are inter-related can best be shown by a consideration of the four objectives toward which any successful adjustment program should be directed. These are: 1. Parity Prices for Farm Products First, farmers should be assured a reasonable income for their work and the use of their land and equipment. That is, the com - mercial supply of agricultural products should be adjusted to existing demand, both domestic and foreign, and every effort should be made to prevent a recurrence of the situation which culminated in the cropping year 1932-33. This goal is recognized and explicitly stated in the Agricultural Adjustment Act, and we are all aware of the fact that farmers cannot be expected to give any great amount of atten - tion to soil conservation and other questions related to the general welfare of the nation until they are able to meet their taxes and interest and to see that their families are reasonably well fed and clothed. 2. Adoquutc Supply for Domestic Consumption Second, consumers should be assured an adequate and continuing supply of food and materials for clothing. So far, the agricultural ad - justment programs have been chiefly concerned with the removal of surplus stocks, which even such disastrously low prices as 20 cents a bushel for corn, 40 cents a bushel tor wheat, and 5 cents a pound for cotton could not force into consumption, rather than with any actual reduction in the supplies of food and cotton moving into actual con - sumption. We have reached the point now, however, where increasing consideration should be given to the quantities v of the several commodi - ties needed for domestic consumption; and, in addition, to the quanti - ties which can be effectively exported. The corn-hog program for 1936, for example, is designed to provide for^an increase in hog pro - duction from the present level. 3. Fanners Developed and Controlled Program Third, but just as important as either of the other goals just listed, farmers should be assured that any continuing program will be dem- </seg>
            <seg id="p172">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ocratlcally developed, and that those farmers, who make the needed adjustments will be protected. If we are to have a successful continu - ing agricultural adjustment program, it is evident that it must be one which farmers themselves have helped develop and which they are willing to back. On the other hand, it is equally evident that the farmers who cooperate in an adjustment program should be given a differential return which will equalize their income with the income of those farmers who refuse to cooperate and who endeavor to obtain an unearned profit. All too often in the past, cooperative organizations have endeavored to obtain orderly production only to see their efforts wrecked by those who stayed outside and increased production. Unless the cooperator can be adequately protected, collective action in the field of agricultural adjustment is certain to fail. 4. Stop Soil Erosion Fourth, farmers and the nation generally should be assured that good farm management and soil conservation will be forwarded by any agricultural program which may be adopted. Actually, this fourth objective is closely related to all of the other three just listed. To stop soil depletion and prevent soil erosion, the acreage in the inten - sive crops such as corn, wheat, and cotton should be decreased, and the acreage devoted to grass and soil-building crops should be in - creased. Such a shift will also tend to bring about the needed adjust - ment of supplies to demand since we are faced with an excess acre - age equivalent to 10 to 25 million harvested acres of crop land at average yields, or 20 to 50 million acres of average crop land pro - vided the adjustment is made by shifting from intensive cash crops to hay and pasture and by retiring submarginal land from cultivation. From the consumers' standpoint, the proper use of [and at tfie present time is the best means by which a stabilized and continuing supply of programs can be so designed as to encourage the proper use of land, •they -w\\\ teiaa. to gVve an a&amp;iWAoiiaY TCwaTo. to the taTmets -w"ho cooper - ate, in that they will stabilize production and increase incomes over a long period. IV. Planning Continuing Program Admitting the need for a continuing agricultural adjustment pro - gram based on the proper use of land, we are faced with the question as to how such a program can best be brought about. Although this is a broad question and one that I suspect none of us can answer at the present, there are several considerations which I should like to call to your attention. We need an accurate factual background on which to base such a </seg>
            <seg id="p173">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION program. In this connection, we have the administrative experience •which has been gained from working together under the Agricultural Adjustment Act since 1933. We know something about the quantities of the several commodities which are needed from the national stand - point, and we have a great deal of information with respect to cropping systems and farming practices which has been accumulated by farmers and agricultural workers through experience and research. We need to coordinate this information. Regional Planning As a first step in this direction, state and federal workers engaged in a cooperative study last summer and fall which we have called the Regional Adjustment Project. The specific task which the agricultural workers in the 48 states undertook was to recommend systems of farming or ranching for each of the type-of-farming or ranching areas in the United States which would check or prevent soil depletion or soil erosion and tend to encourage the adoption of those practices which would lower costs of production. The effect of the adoption of these systems of farming upon acreages and production was also esti - mated. The recommendations and the accompanying estimates are of considerable interest, although it should be understood- that they need to be revised and reworked. Krodcd Ijiinds for Pasture For the Corn Belt, the chief changes recommended were a reduc - tion in the acreage of corn and oats, with a corresponding increase in the acreage of soybeans, hay, and pasture, as compared with the acre - ages which prevailed before 10 '.',4. These changes were designed to result In a less Intensive type of farming, to cheek soft depletion axwl soil erosion, and to remove some of the poorer land from cultivation. TIKft «.M£t faw». tfcvw.

More Peed Crops For the South, the chief recommendations were lor a decrease in cotton acreage and production below the 1929 level, and for increases in the production of all Southern feed crops except corn. These recom - mended changes were designed to lessen soil depletion and control soil erosion and to furnish a more adequate feed base for livestock produc - tion in the South, which would be used to improve the standard of living of farmers and farm workers in the South rather than for the com - mercial market. </seg>
            <seg id="p174">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE For the wheat-producing regions of the Great Plains and the Pacific Northwest, the chief recommendation was for a decrease in the acreage of wheat from the level which prevailed up to 1933 or 1934 In part, the decreases in all of the major wheat regions are accounted for by recommendations for taking low-yielding land out of production. For the semi-arid Range Region, the chief recommendation was for a slight decrease in the number of sheep and cattle carried on the range from the low level which prevailed in 1930 or 1935, with some in - crease in hay production in order to obtain a more ample supply of winter feed. For the Northeast, the recommendations indicate that it would be desirable to stabilize agricultural production at about the present level, since soil erosion is not a serious problem, especially in New England. In general, the changes in acreage and production which would result from the adoption of the recommendations in question are in tbu same direction as the changes which are needed from the standpoint of agricultural adjustment. But the degree or extent of the changes in - volved are not exactly the same, and there are several commodities for which the recommendations from the land use standpoint would need to be modified in view of the present outlook from the demand stand - point. County Planning As a second step in obtaining the necessary factual background the Department and the State Extension Services are at present engaged in the County Planning Project. In part, this project is de - signed to obtain information from the farmers in each county as to the changes in cropping systems and farming practices which are needed from the standpoint of good land use or soil conservation, and estimates of the acreages and production of the several commodities which would be expected to result if such changes were actually ad - opted. After the farmers in each county have supplied the desired information, the results of the Regional Adjustment Project can be re - worked, and we can obtain a more accurate estimate of the extent to which a program based on the proper use of land would tend to obtain the desired effect which is needed from the standpoint of national production. In addition, farmers and others who help with the county work should have a clearer conception of their interest in a national program, and a start should have been made toward the building of a "two-way" track or mechanism by which local planning agencies can work with the central administration. Even though we had the desired factual background which we are now endeavoring to obtain, we all recognize, I think, that the best pro - gram is one which develops by a natural process of growth, that we cannot expect to gain from sudden shifts when we are already headed </seg>
            <seg id="p175">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION in the right direction, and that we can best consider our present posi - tion and plan for a gradual shift. Actually, we still have a great deal of work ahead before we can expect to develop a single contract which will give full satisfac - tion. What is needed is a type of approach and a contract which will consider the land use problem from the local standpoint, and the ad - justment problem from the national standpoint. The crucial point is the determination of the systems of farming which are needed from the standpoint of good farm management and soil conservation and which will at the same time assure the desired national volume of production. We need a much better factual background with respect to local' conditions and changes in cropping systems from the standpoint of the - proper use of land than we have at the present. We need some means of classifying farms with respect to the land use problems involved. And we need to move gradually from our present position toward the general objective which we have in mind, with the realization that we will have to do a considerable amount of experimental work. And last, we must be assured that any continuing agricultural pro - gram which may be adopted is in response to a farm demand, and that farmers themselves have helped develop it. If farmers want a con - tinuing agricultural adjustment program based on proper use of land or a unified contract, they must themselves demand such a program or such a contract, and if it is to be successful, they will also have to help develop and administer it. PROSPECTS FOR GREATER INDUSTRIAL UTILIZATION OF FARM PRODUCTS Talk given by DR. LEO M. CHRISTENSEN, Ames, Iowa It is a common fallacy to consider agriculture as solely a food producing industry. Too many people regard agriculture and manu - facture as separate activities, not realizing the extent of their mutual dependence. Only a small part of the products of the farms reaches the consumer without processing in a factory; there is almost no industry that is not in some way dependent upon agricultural products in its manufacturing operations. The economic and sociological de - pendence of one group upon the other is of even greater importance than is the technical. When these facts are realized, it can readily be appreciated that sound national prosperity can only result from the consideration of agriculture and manufacture as natural partners. The welfare of one is inevitably dependent upon the welfare of the other. </seg>
            <seg id="p176">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Farm Products More Than Food When your committee proposed the title for this paper, they very evidently were aware that there is already an industrial outlet for farm products. Through common usage, the expression "industrial utilization of farm products" has come to mean something other than simple physical processing and refining to prepare the foods which the farmer grows in a form acceptable to the consumer. Probably everyone now thinks of industrial utilization as a chemical conversion of farm products to yield materials other than food. This is the meaning of the term "Chemurgy", which more concisely expresses the idea. "Chemurgic farming" then becomes "the production of special crops for conversion to chemicals rather than use as food or feed." Cotton, flax, hemp, jute, pulp wood, rubber, copra, tanning ma - terials, naval stores, and many other farm products have long been used in the manufacture of non-food materials. It is an astonishing thing how small a part of these raw materials is produced on American farms. Has the farmer of the midwest overlooked this great market? How many farmers of this great agricultural section have fallen into the habit of thinking of their business only in terms of corn and hogs? Within recent years it has become evident that the market for corn and hogs has not developed as rapidly as the ability to produce these commodities. As an emergency measure, it has been necessary to reduce the production to somewhere near the ability of the consum - ing public to use them at prices fair to the producer. It is an establish - ed truth that curtailment in production can never be more than a palliative measure; if the industry is to be prosperous, it must quickly find some other means for utilizing its productive capacity. Idle ma - chinery, idle hands, idle acres never paid dividends. In May, 1935, there was organized a cooperative agency represent - ing agriculture, industry and science, for the express purpose of' study - ing the possibilities of increasing the utilization of farm products in new fields. The Farm Chemurgic Council has been active nearly a year and has a list of projects which it believes to be wholly practicable. These have been selected from a much larger list of projects which are interesting and some of which, at least, give promise of eventual applications. Those which were selected are ready for immediate de - velopment, altho it is recognized that many or more of them require careful technical supervision during the first years of application, par - ticularly in the strictly agricultural phases where research looking toward industrial outlets has lagged behind the strictly chemical and engineering research. I shall briefly mention several of these projects, giving particular </seg>
            <seg id="p177">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION attention to those which seem of greatest interest to the farmers of Nebraska. Cellulose Cellulose constitutes a considerable part of the woody portion of many farm crops, but only a few of these are satisfactory sources of desirable types of cellulose. Cellulose in a highly purified form is used in the manufacture of rayon, celanese, and other synthetic textiles, and for the production of a number of plastic materials such as cellu - lose acetate and cellophane. The uses of this type of material will undoubtedly greatly expand. A less highly purified form of cellulose is used for the production of newsprint and a still more crude form for the manufacture of craft paper and cardboard of various kinds. Much of the better kinds of cellulose are now obtained from other countries. The consumption of pulp wood reached 13,351,000 tons in 1929 and by then much of the domestic timber suitable for this use had been cut and little replanting: had been done. As a result, it was necessary to go to other countries for a satisfactory source of supply. Now the taxpayers are carrying the burden of reforesting considerable portions of the land which were so ruthlessly cut over in these early operations. Dr. Charles H. Herty, Director of the Pulp and Paper Laboratory, Savannah, Georgia, is showing the farmers of that district how to grow timber as a farm crop and realize a profit in the operation. The slash pine seems to give the best results in that state and under culti - vation had made phenomenal growth records. In some cases the trees are ready for harvest in as little as six years. During this six year period, other crops are grown on an annual basis, so that every year the land yields a cash return. The value of this system in con - trolling soil erosion is of the greatest importance. It is probable that some type of annual crop- will give the most economical production of cellulose in the midwest states. Of those that have been used, it seems likely that hemp will prove of the greatest value. A large scale test of this crop is now being made in Illinois and a factory has been equipped at Danville to convert the hemp to cellu - losic products required in industry. The crop this year amounted to 15,000 tons and it is believed that about the same planting will be made next year. The yield was in the neighborhood of three tons per acre, but was somewhat higher than this with the better varieties and with the best cultivation practices. At $10.00 per ton, with the cost of production lower than that of corn, the crop yielded the farmers a somewhat better per acre return than did corn. Why Hemp Projects Fail The factory is the first in this country prepared to make useful products from hemp. There have been many hemp projects started, </seg>
            <seg id="p178">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE but for one reason or another, none has succeeded. The Danville project is being carefully conducted and its operation will be watched with the greatest interest. The fibrous portion of the hemp is useful in making burlap, backing for rugs, and rope. Properly bleached and combed, it makes a strong fibre suitable for use in textiles. The pithy portion of the stalk, called the hurds, is a splendid source of alpha cellulose which is needed for cellulose plastics and synthetic textiles. The successful development of a hemp industry in this country is largely dependent upon the provision of satisfactory equipment for harvesting and decorticating. In foreign countries from which we have in the past obtained our supply of hemp and other fibrous ma - terials, amounting to something over 300,000 tons per year, hand labor is available at a very low wage and the cost of harvesting and decorti - cating by hand is not excessive. In this country, where labor is so much better paid, it is not feasible to do this work by hand. The company operating the Danville plant has designed satisfactory equip - ment to carry on these operations and a staff of skilled technicians who are thoroly experienced in this field. There are a number of varieties of hemp and not all are entirely satisfactory. Furthermore, it is not known which varieties are best suited for cultivation under the various climatic conditions or on the different soil types. It is highly desirable that the State Experiment Stations carry on research to determine these facts at as early date as possible. There is little question but that the hemp industry will grow rapidly, and that this is highly desirable from the farmers viewpoint, but this growth will be delayed unnecessarily if the agricultural phases of the program are not properly studied. Vegetable Oils Vegetable oils find very large use in paints and varnishes, for the manufacture of soap, and for the preparation of various Bolid fats such as oleomargarine. In 1929 there were imported around 400 thou - sand tons of vegetable oils and more than this weight of copra, from which cocoanut oil is extracted in domestic factories. Flaxseed imports amounted to 338,100 tons in 1930-32, most of which was used as a source of linseed oil for the paint trade; the maximum amount im - ported in any one year was nearly 800 thousand tons. Vegetable oils are quite generally products of tropical or sub - tropical agriculture but there are several sections of the United States suitable for their production. The most recent development of im - portance in this field has been the production of tung oil in the south - eastern states. Something over 3 0,000 acres are now in production and this is entirely too small for present demands as evidenced by re- </seg>
            <seg id="p179">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION •cent price advances. The oil produced from these plantings is of better quality than the tung oil previously obtained solely from China and consequently commands a higher price. It is used for insulating electric cables, in the formulation of waterproof varnishes, and in many other ways. It is estimated that within 10 years we shall need a million acres of tung groves. The plantings will be located within one hundred miles of the Gulf of Mexico since it is only in this region that conditions are favorable for cultivation of this crop. A great portion of our paint oil is obtained from other countries. In 1929, we imported 23 million bushels of flaxseed. The domestic production was around 26 million bushels exclusive of the production for seed. The economic production of flaxseed for oil is largely de - pendent upon the utilization of the fibre. There are two plants in Minnesota in which the fibre is made into insulating boards, accoustical quilts, and tow for upholstering. There is also a small production of rugs from flax fibre. Another organization is working on the produc - tion of cigarette paper from domestic flax, to replace the paper which is now largely imported. The flax straw is also of value in the manu - facture of paper of high quality. Paint from Soybeans Soybean oil is also rapidly coming into use as a paint oil, being used in blends with linseed oil. These soy oil paints are giving excellent results and the use is rapidly expanding. In 1931, 3,128 tons of soy oil were used, and in 1934 this had increased to 5,225 tons. Very large increases in the next few years are to be expected. The residue from the oil extractors is an excellent protein supple - ment but also is used in industry for molded plastics. One prominent automobile manufacturer is using' this material for gear shift knobs, Soybeans in rows on a DodRc County Farm. Industrial uses for soybean products have become increasingly important. </seg>

There is a good possibility of a large market in the adhesive field, and as a material for coating paper. Neither has as yet been successfully developed to a commercial scale, but considerable research is in progress. The acreage planted to soy beans is expanding each year. In the period 1930 to '32, the average acreage was 3,253,000 acres but in 1935 over 6 million acres were planted. Ordinarily 25 to 30 per cent of the acreage is harvested as beans, the balance being used as a forage crop. Because of its value in maintaining soil fertility, and because a good industrial market exists for the beans, the soybean is certain to find an increasing favor among farmers. There is need for continued research on the development of new varieties suitable for cultivation under conditions not favorable to present kinds. A great deal of ex - cellent work has been conducted by the Experiment Station at Urbana, Illinois, under the direction of Professor Burlison. Investigations of this type are also in progress in other Stations. Industrial Alcohol Eight-five per cent of the present industrial alcohol supply is made from blackstrap molasses, largely imported. Prior to the World war, much of the industrial alcohol was made from corn, but the greatly increased requirements for corn for food and the large increase in the requirements for alcohol, which is an important raw material for chemical industries both for peace and wartime operations, resulted in a very large expansion in the manufacture of alcohol from black - strap, a waste product in the manufacture of sugar. The price of blackstrap is dictated by the price of corn, the usual relation being such that blackstrap alcohol is just under the price of corn alcohol. The lowest price for blackstrap is around three cents per gallon, or one-half cent per pound of sugar content, this being prac - tically the cost of transportation from Cuba to Atlantic Seaboard points. Blackstrap now sells, c.i.f. Atlantic Seaboard, at 6:5 cents per gallon, or just over one cent per pound of sugar content. Alcohol can be made from three per cent molasses to sell at around 15 cents per gallon and from 6.5 per cent molasses at around 22.5 cents per gallon. These prices are based upon large scale operation and prices are given in tank car lots f.o.b. plant. Alcohol is also made from ethylene, a constituent of natural and cracking still gases. It is supposed that alcohol made from this material costs around 18 cents f.o.b. plant. At present approximately 10 per cent of the alcohol produced is made from ethylene. </seg>
            <seg id="p181">NEBRASKA CUM 1 GROWERS' ASSOCIATION Several developments now ready for commercial application will greatly increase the market for alcohol provided it can be made avail - able at a suitable price. One of the most important is the conversion to acetic anhydride, which will be used in the manufacture of cellulose acetate. The potential market for industrial alcohol is very large. Besides the use in the chemical industry, alcohol is also a splendid fuel for internal combustion engines, and with the development of a domestic deficiency in petroleum, to be expected within ten years, there will be an opportunity for large utilization in this field, because ethyl alcohol can then compete on an even basis with other motor fuels, such as those from oil shale or from coal. During the past 15 years, there has been a very important increase in the consumption of power alcohol. In 1934, the world consumption was more than 200 million gallons. This alcohol was not used alone .as a fuel, but it blends with gasoline or with gasoline and benzene. Usually these blends have carried from 10 to 20 per cent of anhydrous (water free) alcohol. The alcohol used is made entirely from farm products, and usually the development had had governmental support because of its great importance in providing an outlet for surplus and off grade agricultural products and because it has improved the trade balance thru elimination of a large annual expenditure for motor fuel. Anti-knocking Motor Fuel Anhydrous ethyl alcohol is an excellent antiknock agent and its addi - tion to gasoline appreciably improves the quality of the fuel. Alcohol blends suitably prepared are splendid fuels. They possess high anti - knock rating, have marked gum solvent ability, give appreciably cleaner combustion, and provide improved acceleration and mileage. These facts have been established by laboratory research carried on in practically every country, and by very extensive commercial dis - tribution of such fuels in the United States has amply verified these conclusions. The value of alcohol for this outlet can be readily calculated from present gasoline prices and the spread between the various grades. The addition of alcohol produces an increase in octane rating for one number per per cent of alcohol, on the average. Gasoline now sells at the refinery for about six cents per gallon, for 70 octane, and about one cent less for 60 octane. If blending is done at the refinery, alcohol has a value of fifteen cents per gallon. If blending is done at some intermediate point, at bulk stations for example, the alcohol has a somewhat higher value, varying from one district to another, but averaging about 20 cents per gallon. Alcohol can be made from practically all products of the farm • except cotton. In the process, only the starch and sugar are converted </seg>
            <seg id="p182">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE to alcohol, the protein and other non-fermentable constituents being recovered as a valuable feed. There are also produced 6 pounds of carbon dioxide for each gallon of alcohol, about 4.5 pounds of which can economically be recovered in pure form, and converted to dry ice. The protein residue has a value of 1.25 to 1.50 cents per pound, and the carbon dioxide is worth at least one cent per pound in the pure form. One bushel of corn will yield 2.5 to 2.8 gallons of alcohol, 16 pounds of 30 per cent protein feed, and 11 to 13 pounds of dry ice. The value of the byproducts is 32 cents per bushel. The cost of con - version, in a well managed plant, will be not more than 28 cents per bushel, including all capital charges and a satisfactory profit. The cost of the alcohol will, therefore, be very nearly the cost of the corn divided by 2.5 to 2.8. Thus, corn at 50 cents per bushel could yield alcohol at the required 20 cents per gallon, if both the dry ice and protein feed could be sold. Probably the market for dry ice cannot be expanded rapidly enough to take the output in the event of a large corn alcohol development, consequently it is probably necessary at the present time to leave this out of consideration. This means that corn is worth practically 40 cents per bushel in the manufacture of power alcohol. Factories Might Convert Artichokes into Alcohol A few crops occupy a somewhat better position than does corn in this industry. Of particular interest to the Nebraska farmer is the so-called Jerusalem artichoke. From the standpoint of manufacture of alcohol, the artichoke tubers are preferable to corn because of the lower conversion cost. From the farmers viewpoint, the crop is of interest because of the large yields per acre and resistance to drouth and hot winds. There are a large number of varieties of the artichoke and they differ greatly in their yield characteristics. The best varieties will yield 10 to 20 tons of tubers per acre, under normal conditions. Prob - ably in the more arid sections of Nebraska, the yield will average around 8 tons, but the state average should be at least 10 tons per acre. For conversion to alcohol, the tubers are worth $4.00 per ton, with a somewhat higher value for those tubers of better than 15 per cent sugar content. The income from the cultivation of artichokes is, there - fore, $40 to $80 per acre, which is, I am confident, considerably better than the income from corn and most other commercial crops. The ex - perience of the past few years indicates definitely that it is a far more certain crop than is corn or other grains. The artichoke is also interesting as a source of levulose, a sugar 1.75 times as sweet as cane or beet sugar. Probably the future market </seg>
            <seg id="p183">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION for levulose will be in (a mixture) with dextrose, or corn sugar. These sugar blends can be prepared specifically for certain uses. Thus one blend would be designed for the ice cream manufacturer, another for the confectionery trade, another for table use, and still another for the canner. Such blends can undoubtedly be made to sell at the price of imported cane sugar and will in addition, be better suited to the use for which they were prepared. The artichoke tops may also have a value. They can be used for the manufacture of insulating board and may also be a satisfactory source of cellulose for some types of paper. With a top yield of three tons per acre, dry basis, this increase in revenue to the growers might become $10.00 per acre. The present consumption of motor fuel amounts to around 17 billion gallons per year. If all motor fuel contained 10 per cent of alcohol, the total requirement would be 1.7 billion gallons, which would require for its preparation, approximately 650 million bushels of corn, or 68 million tons of artichoke tubers. And this is not the end of this development. The alcohol content can be steadily increased as the decline in domestic petroleum flow and increase in agricultural produc - tivity permits. The potential market which may be realized may be placed at 25 billion gallons, which would require 10 billion bushels of corn or one billion tons of artichokes. There is not enough land available to produce this amount of corn, and it will take nearly 100 million acres of land to supply this amount of artichokes. While the artichoke and certain other high yielding crops will eventually supply practically all of the power alchol consumed, this market has a very great importance to the corn and wheat grower which must be described. The same kind of procedure might also be used to benefit the potato grower. For the sake of clarity, the discussion will be limited to corn, and this is justifiable because corn is the larg - est crop of the midwest. It has frequently been stated that the great fluctuations in the yield of "corn and the consequent large changes in the price, make farming the greatest of all speculations, and that some means of stab - ilizing the price or the production is urgently needed. Control of production will require control of weather, and that is still more of a task than we know how to perform. Consequently, there has always been interest in price control thru some kind of marketing provision. The McNary-Haugen bill and the AAA amendments provide for dump - ing of surplus grains into world markets or into some domestic non - food outlet to put a bottom to grain markets, which have several times behaved as tho there were no bottom. Power alcohol could furnish an excellent outlet for such surplus </seg>

Conclusions The prospects for increasing the industrial utilization of farm products are very good indeed. With proper cooperation of agriculture industry, and science, there should be little difficulty in finding indus - trial outlets for the products of 50 million acres within the next ten years, and this can continue to expand for many more years There is work to be done before these expansions can be fully realized but there is enough ready now to make a very auspicious start. It is fundamental to the success of this program that the research laboratories of the country devote more attention to Chemurgic re - search than has been the case in the past. In particular there is a field here for the attention of the Experiment Station workers who have done so much in the past in improving farm practices. A fundamental principle in this program is gradual shift from products of the mines to products which are produced each year in farm operations. This means essentially a shift from living on in - heritance to living on annual earned income. When that happens, un - employment for able workers will be a thing of the past. We believe this is a program worthy of the best efforts of all groups concerned, and hope that your organization will continue its interest in this work and will acquaint you with the developments which occur and aid you in proper changes in the operation of your farms so that you may fulfill your obligations in the advancement of this program </seg>
            <seg id="p185">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION Discussion following Dr. Christenscn's Talk on "Prospects for Greater Industrial Utilization of Farm Products" DR. KIESSELBACH C. Y. Thompson: What are the possibilities of having an experi - mental factory in Nebraska during the next year? Dr. Kiesselbnch: At the college we have no direct information re - garding it at all, except as Dr. Christensen brings us the information that there is a possibility of an alcohol plant. I think he could give us information on that. It would be very interesting. Dr. Christensen: There is on file in Washington with the Department of Agriculture an application for a loan or a loan and grant for the con - struction of an experimental alcohol plant in Nebraska. What will be the fate of that I have no way of knowing. I do know the application has been in for several months. There is discussion, and has been, in the Department of Agriculture in Washington, for an artichoke research institute. This would include an alcohol plant, at least a small one, altho there is one bit of information indicated that they would probably produce in one year about 1,000,000 gallons of alcohol. That plan is before the Department of Agriculture. There is great deal of interest among industrial groups in the possibility of using artichokes for raw material. There is no plan developed yet so any announce - ment can be made, but several groups have progressed sufficiently with their study and their investigation so that I think it is safe to say a plant will be built. Whether in Nebraska or not I can not tell. Ne - braska is a splendid situation. One group is ready to go ahead, but not ready to make an announcement. The industrial development is coming along. CATCH CROPS AND SPECIAL CROPS FOR THE STATE F. D. KEIM There are a number of catch crops that are old stand-bys. One of the most common is ordinary cane or sweet sorghum. The ordinary black amber variety or early Kansas Orange seems to stand at the top of the list as far as adaptations and yields are concerned. Another one that does well especially for pasture is sudan grass. The cane seems to be better for hay than the sudan but, of course, the cane should never be pastured because of danger of prussic acid poisoning. Another reasonably good catch crop is millet. Personally I prefer the German or Common varieties. Millet makes an excellent hay </seg>
            <seg id="p186">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE but a rather poor pasture. Ordinarily the hay should not be fed alone any great length of time. If fed alone it has a reputation of causing some digestive disturbances. When fed with other grass and legume hays or silage, no trouble results. All of these crops I have mentioned should be seeded on very well prepared seed beds that are firm and compact and as free from weeds as possible. One should seed about 2 bushels of cane, 20 or 25 pounds of sudan grass and about 20 pounds of millet per acre. If a grain drill is available it should be used, being careful not to seed too deeply. There are a number of other crops that are sometimes called catch crops but in my estimation should come in under the heading of "Special Crops". Such crops as buckwheat, soybeans, hemp, broom corn, sunflowers for silage, etc. Before I start discussing any of these special crops it seems to me there are five or six things that one should consider before he plants any of these. First, will there be a ready market? Second, will the crop require special equipment and methods in planting and harvesting? Third, what will be the seed and labor cost? Fourth, will this new crop be adapted to my community? Fifth, will it make more profit than one of the old stand-bys? Sixth, when you read about it did the bulletin or farm paper tell you anything about whether or not it would be adapted to your community? Buckwheat is a crop that can be planted rather late in the summer but it is not very well adapted any place in Nebraska with the possible exception of the north eastern corner. The yields are usually cut because the hot sun blights the blossoms and they do not fill. Ordin - arily there is not a very good market because of the small quantity grown on each farm. Broom corn is another special crop in which many farmers become interested. This crop requires special labor and anyone planning on growing broom corn should become well acquainted with this because it probably is the deciding factor in the success one might attain. The market problem is another one that should be taken into consideration. A variety should be chosen that has relatively long branches and it should be harvested so that the color remains bright. The crop is fairly well adapted to Nebraska. Hemp has received a lot of attention the past few years. It is grown for fiber rather than as a feed. This crop also requires special machinery for harvesting and removing the fiber and so far as I know there is not a ready market established. The crop has been advertised to kill bindweed but in an experiment we have been carrying on here for two years we have found it has relatively little effect as a weed killer. In this regard it is probably no better than a heavy growth of cane. </seg>
            <seg id="p187">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION Artichokes, also, have been receiving a great deal of publicity. Artichokes have the advantage over a crop like hemp in that they can be used for hog feed if there is no other ready market. So far the market for artichokes has been almost entirely one of seed distribution. It is possible that in the future alcohol manufacturing plants may be developed and rather large quantities of artichokes used for this purpose. In this respect, artichokes, of course, will have to compete with corn and other crops. All of us hope that the need for products other than feed will develop so that many of these special crops can be grown profitably. In the meantime, any farmer should proceed cautiously in growing them so that he will not lose a lot of money. Winter barley has been advocated by certain farm papers. So far we do not have a winter barley that lives safely through our winters. In fact, they are not safe north of central Kansas and Missouri. They might live through mild winters but ordinarily they should never be planted on a large scale in Nebraska. Lespedeza is an annual legume that has some promise on the thin acid soils of south eastern Nebraska. It comes up rather late in the spring and ordinarily can not be pastured until after July 1st. Where alfalfa and sweet clover or red clover are adapted, lespedeza can not compete in quantity of hay produced. It can be pastured safely apparently, without danger of bloat to cattle and sheep. A PRACTICAL PROGRAM FOR SOU, CONSERVATION M. P. MILLER, University of Missouri The soil is the most basic of our natural resources. Upon its preservation depends the future well-being of the nation. Someone has said that the degree of intelligence shown by a nation in the use of its land serves as an index to its civilization. Where the soil is per - manently maintained at a high degree of productivity, the well-being of the farm people is practically assured. Furthermore, a reasonably prosperous agriculture has a most favorable influence upon industry and commerce, so that the well-being of the whole people is promoted. It is of great importance therefore that the public at large be brought to understand the relation of agriculture and thus of soil conservation to the welfare of the nation as well as to that of each individual citizen. Soil Depletion Affects Human Welfare We have failed thus far to make soil conservation a first considera - tion. The effects of this failure may be seen everywhere about us. While such effects have been greatly intensified by the economic up - heaval resulting from the World war, yet they are the immediate </seg>
            <seg id="p188">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICLLTLRE results of Improper land use. In areas where soil deterioration has gone furthest, and particularly where the soils were originally of only mediocre fertility, conditions are in many cases deplorable. Not only have the farmers in such areas been reduced to bare subsistence living conditions, in many cases, but large numbers are on relief. In such areas too, the tax rate has been increased because of decreased a'ssessed valuations and tax delinquencies have become common. Insufficient local revenues have resulted in poorer schools, less competent teachers and shorter school terms than in areas where the soil is fertile. More - over, the effects are not confined to the local people. A part of the load must be shifted elsewhere, with the result that the state, which means the general public, must assist in the support of the rural schools in such areas, in the building of roads, and in caring for those unfortunates that must be placed in eleemosynary institutions. But the effects do not stop there. Uncontrolled water runoff and soil erosion, which are common to much of the agricultural regions in the United States, result in excessive floods, the filling of power reservoirs and the destruction of wild life. Soil conservation therefore becomes a matter of vital concern to everyone. The final effect of uncontrolled erosion— exposed subsoil and land abandonment. Unfortunately, the public at large, even when convinced that the matter of soil conservation is vital to the future well-being of the country, may have difficulty in making itself felt. It must be remem - bered that the soil is in the hands of millions of individual farm own - ers and operators and that if it is to be conserved the practices of this great body of people must be modified. There is little doubt that much of the good land in 1 the United States, particularly that lying west of </seg>
            <seg id="p189">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION the Mississippi river, will be still further reduced in productivity in spite of the very commendable educational and demonstrational efforts now being put forth in the interest of soil conservation. The educa - tional process is so slow and the immediate economic obstacles which the average farmer encounters in applying soil conservation methods, are so great that large numbers of farms cannot be reached until much further deterioration has taken place. Furthermore, it must be remembered that between 40 and 50 per cent of our farms are operated by tenants, mostly on short-time leases, and this practically places the great part of these beyond immediate help. Moreover, the depression through which agriculture has been passing has made it almost impossible even for the land-owning farm - ers to practice conservation methods. They have been compelled to follow a hand-to-mouth system. They have been doing everything possible to avoid ruinous financial loss and to make a bare living, so that the effect on the land could not be given much consideration. As a result we have experienced one of the worst periods of rapid soil deterioration in our history. It is believed, however, that agriculture is definitely on its way back to normal prices and that now is the time to combine efforts for securing widespread adoption of conserva - tion practices. Why Does Kuropu Have Less Erosion? There is one aspect of soil conservation in this country that does not seem to be generally understood. This is that the matter of conserving the soil, over much of the United States, presents a far more difficult problem than in the better agricultural countries of Europe. It is customary to point to the high acre yields of these European countries and attribute them to the more intensive systems followed, while at the same time these attainments are held up as a goal for our farmers to reach. There is no doubt that our farmers can attain much higher average yields by improving their methods, but we should not forget that one of the principal reasons for the continued productivity of these western and northern European lands, is because there is very little loss from erosion. These countries have an oceanic climate with moderate, well distributed rainfall, with cool, moist growing seasons and low evaporation, — a climate free from frequent droughts and ideally suited to a grass agriculture. An abundance of grass and com - paratively small acreages of cultivated crops, couple with a low amount of runoff, almost eliminates erosion. When this is contrasted with the continental climate of most of our great agricultural areas, with its torrential rains, high evaporation and more frequent droughts, it is realized that these European countries have a great advantage. When along with this we consider the fact that the farming systems in our principal agricultural regions are largely built around an </seg>

            <seg id="p191">NEBRASKA CROI" GROWERS' ASSOCIATION fact that no system of agriculture is permenently satisfactory that does not provide for restoration of the fertility removed. In con - sidering returns from land we have generally failed to include in our accounting the cost of replacing the fertility taken from the farm. We should, therefore, modify our thinking to a certain extent, and we should understand that the matter of soil conservation must be con - sidered along with that of economic returns. In the long run the two must go together. There is a definite need for national low-cost and long-time credit agencies to provide funds to farmers for the distinct purpose of soil improvement, just as we now have such credit facilities for land purchase and farm operation costs. Thus far our bankers and even the federal authorities have given little attention to this matter. It is quite certain many farmers will never be able to adopt systems of soil conservation unless such credit facilities, or other posi - tive means of assistance, be provided. There are distinct possibilities in a plan providing for simple and direct subsidies to farmers in securing the adoption of certain soil conserving practices. For instance, there are great possibilities in a plan which subsidizes farmers for seeding land to grass or legumes for specified periods of time, such subsidies being provided from federal or state sources. It is very encouraging to know that those responsible for the plans of the Agricultural Adjustment Administration are consider - ing some such method for the future and of making soil conservation one of the foundation stones on which this plan rests. Another possi - bility closely akin to direct subsidies is that of providing partial or total tax exemption on land put to timber, seeded to permanent pasture or given certain positive soil conserving treatments. Such a plan would doubtless require constitutional amendment in many states as well as certain other modifications of the tax system. Nevertheless such a method of reaching the farmer positively, and of securing definite action towards soil conservation would be of profound influence, while at the same time the public in general would be contributing its share. Short Tenures Make Problem More Difficult The relation of our systems of tenancy to soil loss is a matter which should concern us all. In the great agricultural regions from 25 to 50 per cent of the farms are operated by tenants and the majority of these are under a short-time lease. Under such systems of leasage, parti - cularly on those farms lying in the region of significant erosion, soil conservation is almost impossible. Because of the prospective short period of tenure, the tenant cannot be expected to make investments in soil improvement. As a matter of fact, with only a passing interest in the farm it is to his immediate financial profit to get all out of the land he can and return nothing. This is, of course, well understood. At the same time unless the landlord has confidence in the tenant, and </seg>
            <seg id="p192">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE is thus able to provide a longer lease, he Is not in a position to do much toward soil preservation. The system is therefore in the nature of a vicious circle with the soil continuing to suffer, and it is highly im - portant that efforts be made to remedy this situation wherever possible. There are various practical means of approach to this problem. As a matter of fact, much lies with the landlord himself. I have frequently heard our Missouri land owners say that one year is too long for most of their tenants. There may be some truth in this, but I have generally observed that the man who treats his tenants properly can usually find and keep good ones. The matter, therefore, lies with the land - lord first, and with the tenant second. It must, of course, be admitted that from the standpoint of soil conservation, a large number of in - dependent land owners and a minimum of tenants would be ideal. But this matter is so difficult to control as to make it scarcely worthy of consideration. Long-time leases on the other hand, tie a man to the land almost as much as ownership. Since it is probable that we shall have a large number of tenant farmers for a long time to come, the importance of improving the systems of tenure is very evident. __ . - Liberal acreage of good lefrunies such as alfalfa antl cSnverB must he grown on those good farms where fertility is to lie conserved. There is no ottlcr \va&gt;'. One of the difficulties in the way of establishing longer leases is that there are no legal arrangements in most states, providing for economic adjustment between the landlord and tenant at the close of a rental period. Neither ran be expected to make investments in soil Improvement unless he anticipates receiving all of the returns. Con - tracts should be drawn, therefore, and in many states laws should be enacted, making it possible for either landlord or tenant to recognize any unrealized investments of the other at the close of the rental </seg>
            <seg id="p193">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION period and make the necessary adjustments. Such a plan is common in many of the older countries. It should be common in this country. Landlord and Tenant Must Cooperate on Soil Use The landlord can do a great deal in carefully planning the systems of farming which are to be followed under a lease contract. Plans of rotation and soil management and in some cases the use of the stock - share system may be worked out. The development of methods of choosing tenants on the basis of an agreement to follow certain soil conserving practices, such as legume production, contour farming, terracing, and gully control, have marked possibilities. Certain banks and mortgage companies are already taking definite steps in this di - rection, but much is yet needed. Thus far the plans of administering loans and of managing foreclosed farms by the federal land banks and by large commercial corporations have included far too little attention to soil conservation. It must be remembered that continued soil deterioration is not econmically sound. There are greater economic possibilities in maintaining the land than in allowing it to deteriorate further. Another tremendously important principle which should be rec - ognized in the matter of soil conservation is that it is not merely ter - racing, or contour farming, or even the use of a good crop rotation that will conserve the land, but in many cases it is all of these and more. It is a matter touching the whole field of farm management and proper land use. We must have soil conserving systems of agriculture and the farmer who is to conserve his soil must follow such a system. Moreover, that such systems may be adopted generally, instead of by the better farmers alone, it is important that proper systems be worked out for definite soil regions with some federal, state or cooperative jurisdiction to see that such systems are largely followed. Thus the farmers living in a region of the same soil and topographic conditions will find it most profitable to adopt similar systems of agriculture, systems adapted to the soils of the area and to their permanent pre - &amp;eT\a.\.\OY\.. \x\. oU\.e\- tKorcto, \a.TTftexB WsYftg Yrtv&amp;eY sVmWar ccm&amp;WAcms should plan to follow together those systems of agriculture which are most \&gt;voft\.ab\e tor V\\e teg\o i a atid at the same Ume mpst permanent. In such developments some state or federal Jurisdiction will be needed coupled with the cooperative efforts of the farmers themselves. Soil Conserving Systems Generally Most Profitable Lastly it should be emphasized that for the careful farmer, soil conserving systems of agriculture are in the final analysis those which are the most profitable. It is true that on the very best lands which are good enough to produce large yields of cash crops, and in the hands of the average farmer, soil conserving systems may not be as </seg>
            <seg id="p194">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE immediately profitable as the older ones, but in the hands of good men such good soils can be conserved with much profit while at the same time the land will be preserved for future years. However on most of our lands, we have reached the point when soil conserving systems are now most profitable, while further soil deterioration will mean loss. Moreover, it is possible to adopt systems of soil and crop, management which provide immediate and reasonably attractive profits at a minimum financial outlay and which automatically con - tribute to soil conservation. For instance, in a modern soil conserving system corn must have a less important place than it has formerly occupied. We have grown far too much corn for the good of the land and we must find means of curtailing this acreage, the actual amount of curtailment depending upon the soil and region in question. •* "-■" ■* r *'"'■ '■'■ ~~ :L -'' "i*" • -+-- ■.■.-■"- —- ' -■&lt;- ■' - '■'■■:■-' SJtfwiTJf ■CaJfenr r^ " ■ V in eIst&lt;.r P n O NXL O s 1. ° f '|j;S e » crea .8« o. corn is the principal cause of erosion losses k n nd e £ t .He n s a^b^innin^to'^T 0 " ""' pr^ r " sc '' a *°°* ««&gt; ways on this SIS Cultivation Afoelorjitcs WliHe notations f'hpok Erosion The relation of corn production to soil deterioration is shown in a remarkable fashion by some results from the Missouri Experiment Station. For almost 20 years we have been carrying on experiments to determine the influence of the cropping system on erosion losses. The results show that for the land and slope under experiment, con - tinuous corn has allowed erosion to remove approximately 20 tons of soil per acre annually, continuous wheat has allowed the removal of 10 tons, while continuous grass has so reduced erosion that less than one ton per acre is lost. The most interesting figures, however, are those secured from a crop rotation when the three crops — corn, wheat, clover— are combined. While one might expect that the 20 ton loss from corn, the 10 ton loss from wheat and less than one ton for grass would give an average annual loss for the three years of 10 tons, never - theless, the three crops — corn, wheat, clover — in a rotation have </seg>
            <seg id="p195">NEBRASKA CROP GROWEKS 1 ASSOCIATION allowed but 2.7 tons loss. In other words, this rotation in spite of the fact that it contains corn and wheat reduces the erosion to within 2 14 tons of that of continuous grass. Our Missouri farmers, and I fear also many Nebraska farmers, have a great deal to learn regarding crop rotations or cropping systems. We need systems which are just as profitable or more profitable than those now followed, but' which will at the same time go a long way in conserving the soil. In Missouri we are working on certain new cropping systems which promise almost revolutionary results from the standpoint of economy of operation financial returns and soil conservation. It seems certain that there are somewhat similar opportunities in every state. Many cornbelt farmers think that it is impossible to appreciably decrease the corn acreages and at the same time maintain or even increase returns. However, if the decrease in the corn acreage of 10 to 40 per cent, or whatever it may be. is offset by the production of a good legume crop such as sweet clover, alfalfa, or red clover, the effect will be to increase the acre yield of corn. Such an increase will par - tially, and often largely, make up for the decrease corn acreage so that the annual corn production per farm may not be greatly changed Moreover, it must be remembered that when abundant legume feed* high in protein, is provided, each bushel of corn will go much further as feed, while at the same time animals make more weight and more economical gains. It may be more profitable, therefore, to follow such a system, even though a considerable less number of total bushels of corn is produced, while at the same time there are great possibili - ties in these soil conserving systems. Vcur-urOund Pasture Cover There is another principle we are applying in Missouri which is not only a paying one, but which automatically conserves the soil. This is what we are terming a year-around pasture system, which is now being widely advocated by the Department of Field Crops, and which is causing much interest throughout the state. The plan pro - vides for supplementing the permanent bluegrass pasture with temp - orary pastures of Korean lespedeza, crimson clover or small grain, all of which keep the ground well covered and lessen erosion losses. These supplementary pastures, used primarily during the late summer and early fall months provide much additional feed, while at the same time the permanent pasture is given a much needed rest and the whole pasture plan becomes economically attractive. It will be seen, there - fore, that a system in which the acreage of corn is somewhat curtailed, while '.the acreages of legumes for winter feed and of legumes and small grain for pasture are increased, may be worked into a well - rounded system. Moreover, such a system is a profitable one from the standpoint of animal production while at the same time soil con - servation is automatically promoted. </seg>
            <seg id="p196">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Summary It may be said in summary that there is no one single method of conserving the soil which is generally applicable. Usually various methods must be employed on the same farm. Soil conservation is really a by-product of good systems of farm management and of proper land tenure. Moreover, we can no longer afford to allow our good soils to become poorer. It is more profitable to maintain them, since there are systems of soil and crop management which are im - mediately profitable and which at the same time conserve the soil. Progressive farmers should determine which of these systems offers most for their lands. Those farmers who are not able to follow such systems unaided should be assisted through state and federal agencies, through means of credit for soil improvement, and through such changes and systems in land tenure and land use as will provide for soil conserving practices. GRAIX AND FORAGE SORGHUMS FOR NEBRASKA A. F. SWANSON 1 The successful production of grain and forage sorghums in Ne - braska will depend on (1) the selection of varieties best adapted to the state and (2) good cultural methods which will stimulate a rapid growth of the crop to maturity in seasons of normal rainfall. Sorphums require a relatively long growing period with warm days and nights and a reasonable supply of moisture for best de - velopment. These conditions are found in the southern Great Plains and in certain irrigated areas of the Southwest where sorghum culture has reached Its greatest development. The North ward Trend of Sorghum Production In recent years there has been a definite increase in the use of both grain and forage sorghums in Nebraska. Several reasons may be given for this trend: (1) Since 1920 many new selections and hybrids have resulted from intensive breeding work with sorghums as conduct - ed by the Bureau of Plant Industry of the United States Department of Agriculture, operating at its several breeding stations in the southern Great Plains, and by state experiment stations located in this region. Some of the newer hybrids and selections have shown better adaptation in Nebraska than many of the foreign introductions received during the last 60 or 70 years of sorghum culture in America; (2) State exten - sion workers, State agronomists, and livestock men have been alert ■"Associate agronomist, Division of Cereal Crops and Diseases, Bureau of Plant Industry, Dept. of Agriculture, Fort Hays Experiment Station, Hays, Kans. </seg>
            <seg id="p197">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION' to the possibilities of better utilization of sorghums in Nebraska and have fostered a program in that direction; (3) sorghums respond to good cultural methods and, as such methods have been improved, greater success has been attained in growing the crop; (4) as progres - sive farmers have demonstrated that sorghums could be grown and utilized to an advantage, others have followed the practice and thus the interest in the crop has grown; (5) the hot dry weather during the past few seasons has been more favorable for sorghums than for other crops. A reserve of sorghum feed is good livestock insurance. Failure of Sorghums to Mature Is a Handicap As sorghum culture advances northward beyond the Kansas-Ne - brasksj. line it becomes increasingly more difficult to find varieties that will mature. When the grain sorghums are planted primarily for grain and fail to mature properly, the crop will not keep and so can not be utilized to the best advantage. For relatively safe storage the moisture content of sorghum grain should be reduced to at least 13 pei| cent, or lower. Even a small percentage of green or frosted kernels may be hazardous. The failure of the forage sorghums to mature is not so serious a problem since the crop can be saved and utilized for feed in some form. The chief handicap is the need for importing seed from other - regions. Possibility of Overcoming the Failure of Varieties to Mature Sorghum varieties differ widely in many characteristics. Perhaps the greatest degree of variation in the crop is in the range of maturity between types. Varieties range in the period between planting and maturity from 60 to 70 days to 150 or more days. As varieties are crossed and intercrossed by plant breeders there is always the possi - bility of developing a type that will be more suited to Nebraska condi- </seg>
            <seg id="p198">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE tions. Varieties brought from south to north may sometimes have their maturity advanced as much as a week by two years of selection lor earliness. When such types become fixed for earliness no further progress can be made by selection. Occasionally an outstandingly early plant of sorghum may be found in a growing crop. While it may be of hybrid origin and have no great value, others may well be saved until they are tested and found wanting. Some of the finest advances in crop improvement have come about by the ability of some one to detect an outstanding plant. Since sorghum plants show wide variation and seemingly are influenced by change of location, there is always the possibility that types may be isolated which may in time become important foundation stock. Choice of a Variety Adaptation, quality, and yield are the three chief points to be con - sidered in deciding what is the best variety to grow. A variety must be suited to the use for which it is intended. If grain is the chief con - sideration more concern must be given in Nebraska to getting a variety that will mature properly, even at the expense of yield. If roughage is desired the chief consideration will be whether it is to be used for hay, bundle feed, or ensilage. This will depend to some extent on the degree of maturity and on the moisture content, sweetness, and juici - ness of the stalks. There is not always full agreement among live - stock men, crop growers, and research workers as to the relative im - portance of each of these factors. Percentage of l&gt;ry Matter in Sorghum Since forage sorghums do not always mature in Nebraska, or even in northern Kansas, some consideration might well be given to the relative proportions of dry matter in the component parts of immature and mature plants. The relative oven-dry weights of the leaves, stalks, and heads of the mature sorghum crop grown at Hays in 1933 and the immature crop of 1935 is presented in table 1. The average determin - ations in five varieties of immature forage sorghum showed that the leaves constituted 44.1 per cent of the plant, the stalks 53.9 per cent, and the few small heads 2.1 per cent. In the immature grain sorghums the leaves constituted 51.5 per cent of the dry matter, the stems 45.9 per cent, and the heads 2.6 per cent. The average of all varieties was roughly half leaves and half stems. The relative proportion of leaves changes when a sorghum crop is fully mature. In the mature crop of the forage varieties the leaves constituted only 20.2 per cent of the dry matter, the stems 53.9, and the heads 26.0, while in the grain sorghum group the leaves make up 26.3, stalks 39.7, and the heads 34.0 per cent of the dry weight. </seg>

Moisture Content of Sorghum When a crop fails to mature properly the moisture content of the whole plant as well as of the leaves and Btems taken separately remains relatively higher than when the crop matures fully. This comparison, based upon green weights, between an immature and mature crop is shown in table 2. In immature plants, as represented by the crop harvested at Hays in 1935, the moisture content of the whole plants in the sorgos was 76.8 per cent and in the grain sorghums, 72.6 per cent. The moisture content of the leaves and stems was much the same in the two groups. When the moisture determinations were made for the matured crop grown at Hays in 1933, the whole plants in the forage sorghums contained 65.4 per cent moisture, while those of grain sorghums con - tained 55.5 per cent moisture. The greatest loss of moisture content was in the leaves of the mature plants. </seg>

            <seg id="p201">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION The total dry matter, as well as the moisture content, of Immature and mature sorghum has some bearing on the palatability of the crop when used as bundle feed. As has been Indicated, when sorghum fails to mature the proportion of leaves and stems is about equal. The moisture content is higher, however, than in mature sorghum. Cured sorghum with a relatively high moisture content is more palatable than is dry sorghum. Sorghum plants that fail to head or mature usually have slender stalks that are largely or wholly consumed by the animals. Consequently, while the tonnage of feed per acre may not be so great when sorghums fail to mature, the greater utilization of the entire plant may in a measure compensate for the lower yield. On the other hand, as will be shown later, mature sorghum is higher in sugar. A fully matured crop may be utilized to better advantage as ensilage, for the reason that the dry, hard, and otherwise unpalatable stalks, as well as the leaves, are made more palatable. There is less waste in such a crop when made into silage. Palatability of Forage Sorghums It has generally been recognized that sweetness and juiciness of sorghum varieties may have a marked influence on the feeding value of the crop. Such sorgos as Kansas Orange and Atlas are believed to be more palatable to livestock than the kaflr because of the greater inherent juiciness and sweetness. The juiciness, sweetness, and mois - ture content of sorghum varieties is in need of further investigation for a better understanding of their relationship to palatability. Palatability tests with sorghum as bundle feed now under way at the Hays station indicate that, while high moisture content seems to be an important factor, sweetness also is favored by the animals. Although the moisture content in immature stalks of grain sorghum is but slightly lower than in those of sorgo the latter group is preferred by livestock. Most mature grain sorghums when placed in shocks to cure during the fall lose their moisture more readily and at a faster rate than do the forage varieties. In table 3, Pink kaflr is compared with Early Sumac and Atlas. In a field cured test and moisture content of Pink kafir fell to 24.1 per cent by November 28 as compared with 48.6 per cent for Atlas. When fully mature bundles are fed, the Pink kaflr is found to be very unpalatable, while Atlas is greatly relished. </seg>

SORGHUM VARIETIES TO GROW The agronomists and extension workers of Nebraska have accum - ulated much Information as to the best varieties to grow in the State. A brief report of a few of the best varieties as to their behavior in Kansas follows: . </seg>

Atlas is now the most popular of the forage sorghums since its in - troduction to Kansas farmers in 19 28. It is a pedigreed selection from a field cross between Sourless sorgo and Blackhull kaflr. Plants of Atlas grow to a height of from 7 to 10 feet and require from 120 to 130 days to mature. The variety has a sturdy leafy stalk. It is abundantly juicy and sweet and holds these properties late in the season, which makes the variety one of the best for dry feeding. Un - fortunately, it is rather late in maturity for a large section of Kansas and relatively more so in Nebraska. Pure seed is hard to obtain with prices high. At times the seed trade has substituted Dwarf hegari seed at Atlas prices. More recently, a short-growing, scanty-leafed variety of early maturity and some sweetness, known as Tricker kaflr, has also been substituted for Atlas. Kansas Orange was extensively used before the introduction of Atlas and still serves much the same purpose. The variety is more susceptible to lodging and thus has lost in popularity. Early Sumac is a desirable early forage variety used in the western half of Kansas. It is about 20 days earlier than Atlas and produces a lower tonnage. The plants grow from 5 % to 7 feet tall. Leoti Red is one of the sweetest sorgos known and has about the same maturity as Early Sumac. It is attractive in appearance and leafy, growing to a height of from 6 to 7 feet. The variety does not have wide distribution and seed is difficult to obtain. Black Amber is early, hardy, and dependable as a crop but lacks in feeding qualities when compared with Atlas, especially if used as a dry feed. </seg>
            <seg id="p204">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Cheyenne sweet-stalked kafir is one of the earliest maturing new hybrids which has had a rather wide distribution in western Kansas and Nebraska. It is about midway between a forage and grain sorghum. If the variety is permitted to produce a crop of grain its forage value is lowered. The tonnage is relatively low when compared with other varieties in normal seasons. Much seed of this variety was sold as Atlas in 1935. A brief description of the better known grain sorghums follows. Pink kafir has long been popular in Kansas, having value as both a grain and silage sorghum. The stalks from a matured crop are too - dry for best use as a bundle feed. Feterita is a reliable variety for grain if stands can be secured. The best yields are secured from late planting between June 15 and 30. Dawn kafir is useful as a grain variety in any region where it will mature. Western Blackhull is somewhat later than Dawn but serves the same purpose in Kansas. It should be regarded as generally too late for Nebraska. Dwarf hegari is probably one of the best bundle feeds of the grain sorghum group but erratic in grain production, except under irrigation and a favorable growing season. Dwarf hegari is well relished by livestock as bundle feed when the crop fails to make grain. Kalo is of hybrid origin and has ranked highest in grain yield in any period of comparison at the Hays station. It seems to have good A plot of Early Kalo. </seg>

Sooner lodges too readily in Kansas for a combine type and in normal years of rainfall cannot com - pete with later maturing types. It is favored for late planting. Early Kalo is an early maturing variety ranking high in yield and should be further tested to determine its regional adaptation. Comparative forage and grain yields are shown in table 5 for the better known sorghum varieties grown at Hays for all or a part of the 7-year period, 1929-1935. The yield comparison is also made with corn. Corn in central Kansas will generally yield only one-half to two - thirds as much as the grain sorghums. </seg>

Sorghum endures a great deal of hardship and neglect, except in the seedling stage. It also responds generously to good treatment. Experiments indicate that it pays well to spend a little extra time before planting, if necessary, to provide a good seed-bed. This is especially true on the tight or heavy soils. On sandy soils seed-bed preparation is not so difficult, but good treatment also is worth while. One of the methods which has given best results on the Hays station is listing late in the fall or during the winter, breaking down the ridges in the spring to destroy a crop of weeds, and planting in the old furrow by nosing out the soil with a furrow-opener planter or a lister. In the growing of sorghum, especially for grain, difficulty is frequently experienced in securing a stand of the desired thickness. Without a reasonable stand the crop is doomed from the beginning </seg>
            <seg id="p207">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION and with a poor stand a maximum yield cannot be expected. It is also a handicap to have a stand too thick. A thick stand will make forage but generally does not make a good yield of grain. Four of the most common causes of failure in securing stands may be listed as follows: Poor seed, too early seeding, poor seed-bed, and heavy rains following planting. The first two causes apply to all climates and soils. The last two are more commonly experienced on heavy soils and where sorghums are planted in lister furrows instead of with surface planters. The failure to secure a stand because of poor seed can easily be avoided by a germination test. If the seed is known to be poor' one can increase the seeding rate or secure new seed. After one has gone to the trouble and expense of preparing a good seed-bed he cannot afford to plant seed that will not grow when good seed can be secured at a cost of 10 cents or less per acre, when normal prices prevail. Sorghum should not be planted too early. It is a warm weather crop and requires warm soil for prompt germination. Good seed, planted in cold soil, even if other soil conditions are. favorable, will germinate very slowly. Should rain and cool weather follow planting a portion of the seed will mold and rot. Not only is germination slow but early growth is retarded. Weeds come along with the sorghum and grow more rapidly. Much difficulty is experienced in attempting to get rid of the weeds. The result is that many of the weeds are left to grow and to compete with the sorghum for the moisture, all of which the sorgham crop will need to make the best yield. Different methods have been tried out at the Hays station for planting sorghum. The yields from these methods are shown in table 6.

The best method of seed-bed preparation for sorghum is fall listing followed by leveling the ridges in the spring when a crop of weeds may be destroyed by the operation, and planting in the old furrow by nosing it out with a lister has produced the highest yield. The poorest results have been secured by planting with a lister without any previous tillage. The germination by this method is always very much lower than by methods where the land is prepared before seeding time, and complete failure of stand is frequent. Early spring disking followed by listing at planting time has given better result* than listing at planting time without previous tillage but has not been so good as the early blank listing followed with some tillage previous to planting. Pall or winter plowing with some surface tillage in the spring for destruction of weeds produce a good seed-bed and has produced good results but not quite so good as the late fall or early spring blank listing method and it is more expensive. THE BEST SMALL GRAINS FOR YOUR NEBRASKA FARM C. A. SUNESOX U. S. D. A. Agronomist Lincoln, Nebr. I like the heading appearing at the top of the Nebraska Crop Grow - ers' Association stationery which reads: "The best is none too good." If we admit this statement, and you accept our admission, then we have a good place for "taking off" on this discussion. As we proceed it should be apparent that I do not believe in dishing out recommenda - tions as a doctor does pills. A doctor you know has, or is supposed to have, a different pill for each kind of sickness. We try to fit one best variety to all conditions common to our climate. Unless you under - stand this difference, and really know what each variety is capable of doing under a variety of conditions, then you are apt to go from bad to ■worse in a perpetual round of changing varieties and ideas. That is bad business for both you and your community. Spring or Winter Wheat? My subject seems to divide itself into two parts. In the first place it should be clearly understood that I am speaking of your Nebraska farm. The United States Department of Agriculture, in its most recent publication on the subject, lists 273 varieties of wheat as being grown </seg>
            <seg id="p209">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION on the farms in the United States. Of these probably not more than 20 or 25 are grown in Nebraska and probably only a few of these have a rightful place. It is certain however that a far greater number have been tried by farmers much to their disappointment. In explaining the adaptation of varieties I like to think of the comparative yields of spring and winter wheat as established at the experiment stations at Manhattan, Kansas; Lincoln, Nebraska; and Brookings, South Dakota. These really show us how sensitive our crops may be to what seems to be a similar climate. At the Kansas Station, for instance, over a long, period of years the very best spring wheat which they have been able^ to obtain has on the average yielded only 18% as much as their best, winter wheat. At Lincoln the best spring wheat has averaged 48%. as much as our best winter wheat. At Brookings, South Dakota, yields of the better spring and winter wheats have been nearly identical but under this environment spring wheat is preferred for it gives a more consistent yield with fewer failures. Fortunately, the extreme sensi - tivity of wheat and a number of our other crops is much more pro - nounced in movements north and south than in movements each and west in Nebraska, so it is possible for us to make recommendations for central and western Nebraska based on our Lincoln results with a con - siderable degree of success. Malting Barley Considerations Since we are still considering Nebraska we might also mention malting barley. You have probably heard of the high premiums being paid for this grain and at least wondered what the possibilities are for getting some of these. Unfortunately, I can not offer you much en - couragement. In the first place, those who are familiar with the subject do not consider the choice of a variety to be the most important con - sideration in the production of malting barley. Therefore, it is certainly hot to your advantage to go out and pay a large premium for seed of the so-called preferred varieties for malting. Malting barley at its best is made up of plump, uniform, and mellow kernels — something not characteristic of most Nebraska barley. Special knowledge and experience seems necessary in the culture, manner of harvest and threshing of the grain to produce really premium malting grain. Many of the farmers in the ideal growing sections fail to produce an accept - able finished product which commands a premium. Nebraska — Not a Late Oats Climate As still another reminder of the fact that you are farming in Ne - braska I would turn your attention to oats. Last year due to the feed shortage a considerable tonnage of late ripening varieties of oats was imported from the irrigated sections of the west. The appearance of this oats thrilled a great many farmers in Nebraska for it was even </seg>
            <seg id="p210">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE plumper and heavier than much of the barley which they ordinarily produce, with some test weights as high as 44 pounds. Unfortunately, this oats when sown under our climate seldom matures anything more than an almost empty hull. It is very important to choose small grain varieties which are adapted to the locality in which you want to farm. Our Nebraska oats would make a very poor comparative showing under irrigation in a good cool oats climate. Cheyenne— an outstandinp; winter wheat on a Perkins County Farm. This summer fallowed field yielded 42 bushels per acre in 1935. Wheat Yields So much for keeping you in Nebraska! Our next consideration con - cerns what we really mean when he say "best." It is not an easy thing to get a better variety. The compartive yields during the past six years of Nebr. 60, Cheyenne, Nebr. 1063, and Nebr. 1069 and the parent Turkey wheats from which they were selected have been as - sembled in Table 1. Each of these new varieties represents the best single individual line from among several hundred original isolations, all of which differed from each other. Any one of the others which were rejected represented a potential variety. Fortunately these were never added to the problems of farmers. Important Considerations of Wheat Varieties There are four things which I should like to have you get from Table No. 1. In the first place we have three distinct Turkey wheats tracing to different introductions from Europe or Russia. These Turkeys are different enough in their appearance so that you could readily distinguish them at most any stage of growth from winter through to harvest. In some years one tends to yield better than another; in other years the relationship is reversed. The average </seg>
            <seg id="p211">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION yields tend to be very similar, indicating that all are very well adapted to this section.

This is not especially surprising and does not, in our way of thinking, indicate that Nebr. 60 is running out, or that the parent Turkey is necessarily improving through natural selection. Nebr. 60 was originally released because of superior winterhardiness, though it was recognized among other things that it was somewhat more rust susceptible than the parent Turkey. Now our experiments in western Nebraska and experiences of other workers in the north clearly show that Nebraska. 60 is still superior in winterhardiness. The trouble during the last six years has been that we have not had enough winter - killing to enable Nebr. 60 to show its advantage.

In this case it is up to us Experiment Station men and, if we pass favorably up to you to decide whether these are really deserving of a rank among the best varieties of winter wheat. I do not think we are quite ready to pass our opinion. Planting Dates Affect Yields In choosing between varieties we have all been inclined to regard comparative yields as the principal measuring stick. I do not believe this has been entirely justified for results at this and other stations have shown that the comparative yields of varieties may be changed by a large number of factors. Since We make comparatively few tests it is possible to "go wrong" if we consider yields only. Let me give you a couple of examples from our 1935 work. In Table 2 the com - parative yields of two varieties in advanced stages of nursery testing are given. These were sown at two dates in the fall which permitted a spread in the heading dates last June. In the case of Cheyenne, the yields from both planting dates were essentially identical. In the case of the (Minhardi x Minturki) x Tenmarq hybrid No. 23667, an extremely early variety which is even more rust susceptible than Cheyenne a very high comparative yield resulted from early sowing while the mid- October sowing resulted in a yield almost identical with that of Cheyenne. We had a similar type of experience in 1931 which would illustrate the point even better. In that case with the same range in planting dates we observed an inter action of both winterkilling and Hessian-fly damage in different degrees. In the early sown series Hessian fly damage was most severe while in the late sowing much more winterkilling occurred. Among the varieties tested were hardy </seg>
            <seg id="p213">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS 1 ASSOCIATION fly-resistant types which yielded relatively well in all planting date groups; hardy but fly-susceptible varieties which yielded well except when sown early; and fly-resistant but less hardy varieties which yielded relatively low when sown late. These illustrations should make it clear that the comparative yields which you or we get often depend entirely on planting date alone. Planting-date itself gives rise to more yield variation than is commonly supposed, for during the past five years in testing a number of varieties we have found that the October 30 planting has given yields of from zero to 80 per cent as much as the October 1 date, depending on the season. Early Harvest for Rusted Wheat The rust epidemic last summer prompted us to harvest several varieties from several dates of fall seeding on fixed dates, namely July 2 and 9. On the latter date, due to premature ripening effects peculiar to the season, all varieties had dried up. Data from this experiment, as shown in Table 3, are presented here for the purpose of showing how stage-of-harvest may in exceptional cases influence com - parative yields. In the October 1 sowing particularly, great differences in the yields of the several varieties were noted as a result of early harvest under conditions of severe rust. This should not be taken as evidence favoring early harvest of rusted wheat under all conditions. As a matter of fact, the wheat sown October 22 was just as heavily rusted during that first week of July, and yet early harvest in this instance was disadvantageous. Agronomists in general do not ad - vocate early harvest of rusted wheat. The point here is that recom - mended practices like recommended varieties are not always top performers. I have no quarrel and I doubt if you have with our ability to adequ - ately sample our fields and determine with high accuracy the com - parative yields for a given condition. I hope that the discussion I have just given you has impressed you with some of the limitations of these yields and the difficulties in applying them. Our big problem in variety testing is not to merely determine yields but to associate with these yields definite causes for their being what they are. Recommended Varieties We recommend three varieties of winter wheat — Cheyenne, Nebr. 60, and Turkey. There are other varieties being grown in the state but we do not feel the farmers are justified in growing them. Last summer a number of farmers not conforming to our recommendations were quite ready to abandon extremely rust susceptible varieties such as Harvest Queen and Kruse. A number of others shifted to Blackhull or Iobred for the first time, because of their favorable reaction last year. Blackhull is somewhat rust resistant and probably showed to </seg>
            <seg id="p214">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE advantage last year because of Its earlier maturity. As I have stated repeatedly, Blackhull is not winterhardy and Nebraska farmers who grow it are due for a real freeze-out one of these winters. lobred is one of the most rust resistant hard wheats but has not given good average results in Nebraska and in some years shatters badly. We have many new things in process of development as a result of exten - sive activity in winter wheat improvement. Some of our new wheats combine extreme earliness, rust and bunt resistance, hardiness, and Hessian-fly resistance and I am hopeful that within a very few years there will be something new that you can be sure is worthy of trial. The Station recommends two spring wheats — Ceres (a bearded wheat) and the old standard Marquis. Of these Ceres will probably average 2 bushels more than Marquis under most Nebraska conditions. Of the other spring wheats being grown in the state, Dixon and Java are rather prominent. Both give fairly good yields but are discrim - inated against severely by millers. The variety Reward, which re - sembles Marquis except that it is earlier and has hairs on the head glumes, is coming into the state and might soon be considered favor - ably. This last year due to rust, Thatcher was given a lot of publicity. Thatcher is rust resistant but we are not sufficiently familiar with its other characteristics to offer a recommendation concerning it. Recommended Barley and Oats Varieties A number of barley varieties are being grown in the state. We believe the acreage of Trebi, Short Comfort, Glabron, and Spartan is justly on the increase. Trebi, you know, is a rough-awned barley; but a good one. Comfort and Glabron are smooth-awned, 6-row barleys; while Spartan is a smooth-awned, 2-row barley. A few farmers in northeast Nebraska grow Velvet, one of the so-called malting varieties. Yield results at Lincoln would discourage the growing of Velvet. I have previously intimated that the possibilities for producing malting barley in Nebraska, regardless of variety, are not very good. Occasion - ally we have some question concerning winter barleys. In certain seasons these can be grown successfully but in the main I doubt if any of the varieties should be risked in Nebraska. It is important to re - member that chinch bugs relish barley and that there are no known resistant varieties. For a considerable number of years Nebr. 21 and Burt 293 have been regarded as the best oat varieties for the state. The variety Iogold seems to have every desirable characteristic of Nebr. 21, and in addition carries high resistance to stem rust. A rapid increase in the acreage of Iogold in Nebraska seems certain. The Station here has been doing considerable work In oat improvement but drought haa slowed up the program considerably. There are some rather promis - ing hybrid selections coming along, however. </seg>
            <seg id="p215">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION The recommended varieties which I have discussed represent ac - cording to our experiences the best small grains for your Nebraska farm. As a result of my discussion I hope the next time you meet an Experiment Station man and engage him in conversation about these recommended varieties, or a new variety, that you will not merely ask how much it yielded last year; but that you will seek out all of the comparative data on disease and insects and different environmental responses which are available, and on the basis of these taken together with yields that you will make your choice as to what is best for you to grow. Such an interest and understanding on your part would in turn stimulate us to greater watchfulness and enthusiasm. HOW WE ARE FIGHTING THE BINDWEED ON OUK FARM L. H. STANDER &amp; SONS On about April 25, 1934, we started to summer till 110 acres of land that had become infested with bindweed. The area covered with the weed, we would say, was about 10% or 12%. The machine used was a John Deere Duckfoot shovel cultivator, 10 feet wide with thirteen 12-inch shovels, which would have a total cutting edge of 13 feet. This was drawn with a model D John Deere tractor. We found that it requires about as much power to operate this cultivator four inches deep as it does to pull a three bottom 14-inch plow six inches deep. The first few cultivations were at a depth of about three inches, and the new plants would come to the surface in seven or eight days. This land was watched closely, and at the first appearance of weeds, the cultivator was again put to work, which required three days of steady grind. Late in June we carefully inspected some of the weed plots to de - termine the effect of the several cultivations on them. This was dis - couraging. We found that none of the plants were dead. At this time, we would have plowed the ground deep had it not been too dry and hard. We continued the cultivation four inches deep with the Duckfoot until about the first of September. Inspection at this time gave us some encouragement. While only a few plants were dead, nearly all of them showed a weakness or failing health. Instead of the plant sending out from two to six new vigorous sprouts or shoots, we found from one to three that were not so vigorous and required more time to reach the surface. The cultivation was continued when necessary the remainder of the season. Then about the 10th of October we took off six of the shovels and adjusted the balance to corrugate the land as much as possible so it wouldn't blow during the winter and spring. </seg>
            <seg id="p216">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Clean Cultivation for Two Years In the spring of 1935, the bindweed made its appearance early in May, which is about a week or ten days later than previous years, show - ing the effects of 19 cultivations of the summer of 1934. About 10% or 15%, we estimate, is all that came back to continue the fight an - other season. The fight was carried on the summer of '35, the same as in '34, but required less effort because of the fact that the weed was slower in coming to the surface to show fight. In the two years, we cultivated the land 30 times — 19 the first year and 11 the second. We think we have made a mistake in planting wheat instead of leaving it for corn next year. We expect to plow this land next year as soon after harvest as is possible, and continue the fight on the bindweed, if there is any left.

As it was the first bindweed I ever had to fight, I began looking for a suitable machine to cultivate the weed as I concluded the chlorate method was too expensive. I looked over all of the catalogs on duck - foot machinery that I could find and finally came to the one-way disc or wheatland plow, as it is sometimes called. I examined it very care - fully and found that if it was set to its extreme for shaving the ground, hardly anything could get by without being shaved or cut off. In August, 1933, I plowed the field deep enough to get the trash out of the way and in a couple of weeks the bindweed was coming up and doing well. I had not purchased a machine so I double disced the field. Well! I just helped it grow. I knew of a 5 foot John Deere </seg>
            <seg id="p217">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION Tiller or one-way disc as it is called, so I hired it and went over the field. I liked the work fine, so I came to the state fair to look over machines for this work, and wound up by going hack home and buying a 7 foot John Deere disc tiller. This size can be cut down to a 5 foot size if the 7 foot is too hard for a tractor to pull. The same fall we tilled the field about every week, depending upon the rapidity of growth until the growing season was over. In the year 1934 we commenced work as soon as first plants ap - peared in the spring and kept it down until growing ceased. We went over the field 22 times. Our intentions were to go over it as soon as growth appeared above the ground. The writers tell us to cultivate it when it is leafed out, but we thought it might rain and hold us off a week, then our work would be somewhat wasted, so as soon as we saw growth, we tilled it. We ran our machine at 3 to 4 inches deep as this seemed to suit our conditions best. From our observance the bindweed seemed to do as well during the dry season of 1934 as in wetter years. With the 7 foot machine and the old model K. 18 x 32 Case tractor we could till about 2% acres per hour at a cost of 15 or 16 cents per acre for gas, oil, and grease. The machine cost $140 new but this tool can be used for other purposes, such as preparing small grain seedbeds, and anywhere that an extra good discing job is needed. Figuring the usual depreciation of 10% on machinery cost, we find the machinery costing around 26 or 27 cents per acre plus 15 cents for fuel and oil, making a total cost of 41 or 42 cents per acre. The cost of fuel and oil may vary from year to year, also in different parts of the state, thus making it a trifle more or less expensive as the case might be. More Economical Than Chlorate During 1935 we did not have to do as much work as in 19 34. We did not have to till the whole field as often as the old original patches in the field. As nearly as we could figure, we tilled the equivalent of 8 times over the field. The growth seemed pretty weak this year. We think we have it whipped unless some of the old patches come again. Up to this time we have tilled about 38 times at a cost of 42 cents per acre per time, or a total of $15.96 per acre for tilling. One plowing at about 40 cents plus 15.96 = $16.36 total cost per acre. According to reports on the sodium chlorate method, the cost per acre is around $40 for a killing treatment. Therefore, we see it is about $23 per acre cheaper to kill by cultivation, provided I have killed it. I will not say I have it killed, but I feel gratified so far. One of my neighbors treated two patches in the fall of 1934 with </seg>
            <seg id="p218">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE sodium chlorate. He killed one patch but the other was treated again last fall, 1935. So you see chlorate doesn't always kill it. I have done very little with chlorate, but believe it will do the work if applied heavily enough. I can give you a more definite report next fall about what has happened in my case. Will say if you wish to kill by cultivation, go after it and stay with it. Don't get discouraged if your neighbors think you are throwing your work away. If I can be of any help to anyone in destroying bindweed, I will be more than glad to do so. PASTURE MANAGEMENT FOR BETTER LIVESTOCK RETURNS By LLOYD NICHOLS, Brock State Winner in 1033 — Nebraska Pasture Contest We know that grass is the natural food of livestock. The buffalo that once roamed the prairies of Nebraska lived entirely on grass. It is not only more palatable, but also more nutritious and more bene - ficial to the general health of the animal than even the best of cured feed. When we think of grass for livestock feed, we think of "pasture". Pastures are divided roughly into two classes, namely: permanent pas - tures, and temporary pastures. The drouth of 1934 was very disastrous to the permanent pastures of our state. It has been estimated that nearly ninety per cent of the permanent pastures of Nemaha county were killed or seriously dam - aged by the drouth. Because of this, farmers would have been very short of pasture had they depended entirely on permanent pastures. To meet this emergency, we used a pasture rotation, similar to the one that we have used for the past three years to supplement our permanent pasture. For the past year this rotation consisted of, fall rye, second year sweet clover, spring seeded fall wheat, sudan grass, alfalfa, volunteer oats, first - year sweet clover, and rye grass. Pall rye is generally drilled early in September. Last year it was drilled in ground from which corn had been removed for silage the first of August. In average years it is sown in early plowed stubble ground. Sheep Grazing After Cattle on Rye Usually about one bushel of seed is sown per acre, but due to the </seg>
            <seg id="p219">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION dry season only one-half bushel per acre was drilled In the fall of 1934. This was in two fields. One field was pastured off in the late fall by cattle and horses. The other field was pastured off in January, first by cattle and later by sheep. A few sheep were again turned on this field late in March. The cattle were turned on the rye the middle of April and continued there till about the 1st of June. Sheep and horses were also pastured on this rye. The stock was changed back and forth from one field to the other, thus giving the rye a chance to grow. The rye was plowed under the first of June. Half of this ground was drilled to sudan grass, using 20 pounds of seed per acre, June 9th. The remainder of the ground was planted to hegari July 1st. This was used for ensilage. Sowed Wheat in Sweet Clover Sweet clover had been sown with the oats in the spring of 1934, using 10 to 12 pounds per acre. Due to the drouth we did not secure a good stand of clover, however, as we needed the pasture we drilled fall wheat in part of the field late in March, at the rate of one bushel per acre. This wheat did not grow much because of the dry weather till after the rains started in May. From then on it made a very rapid growth. By the middle of June it was 15 inches high and very thick on the ground. Cattle and horses were turned from the rye on to this field of wheat and sweet clover. They grazed chiefly on the wheat. The wheat died down the last of June, after the rains stopped and the weather became hot; however, the stock continued to graze on the wheat till it was all eaten. The sweet clover was not clipped, and of course became very tall and stemmy. Another field was drilled to sweet clover along in the spring of 1934. A fairly good stand was secured on this field. It furnished considerable fall pasture in the fall of 1934. Stock were turned on this field June 1st. This field was rotated with some permanent pasture. These fields of sweet clover were pastured until they were plowed under for fall wheat. Sudan and Alfalfa for Summer Pasture The sudan grass was allowed to grow till it was two feet high. The cattle were turned on it the middle of July. From this time until frost the last of September, it was pastured almost continually. From August 20th to October 1st, alfalfa, from which the first crop had been removed for hay, was used to supplement the sudan grass. </seg>
            <seg id="p220">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE From October 1st until the forepart of November a large amount of pasture was obtained from volunteer oats and third year sweet clover. Ten pounds of sweet clover and 12 pounds of rye grass were drilled on a five acre field last April. This grew very fast and by the 1st of July was 30 inches tall. Because of a surplus of pasture during June, this was not pastured. The rye grass seeded and came up volunteer in the fall. When this was about three or four inches high, 30 ewe lambs were turned on it. They obtained over two months pasture from it. Sweet clover is used for a two-fold purpose. First as a soil builder, and second as a pasture to take part of the burden off of the perman - ent pasture. Also, by using it as a pasture we get a cash income, indirectly of course, from the land while it is in sweet clover. Sudan grass has its place in the rotation because it furnishes abundant feed during the hot and dry part of the pasture period. The longer the pasture season can be made, the less the cost of cured feed and the less the labor cost of caring for livestock during the course of a year. BROME FOR BEEP By JACOB SAL.TZMAN, Fillmore County State Winner 1935 Nebraska Pasture Contest We hear questions about brome such as, what is bromegrass? Where did it originate? How long has it been in this country? As Mr. Bowman said, it probably has to be acclimated, and maybe there are different kinds of seed. We hear different stories about it. The only basis from which I can talk is the experience I have had and know to be true. Some seed companies advertise it as Hungarian brome. Others say it was imported from Russia many years ago. I shall read what a few of the seed companies have to say: "Bromegrass is vigorous, hardy, with strong creeping roots. It is especially valuable for poor soil, for hay, for pasture, as it withstands heat, drouth, cold, and outyields most other grasses. Is useful for sowing on steep hillsides; it forms a very firm sod; keeps the soil from being washed away, and the grass makes an early growth. It Is about three weeks earlier than any other grass, and remains green until December or real hard freezes. It stands the closest cropping without injury. This grass grows from three to four feet in height. It yields an enormous crop of excellent hay. The best crop is cut when the grass is in full bloom." </seg>
            <seg id="p221">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION I find this to be a true statement with reference to bromegrass ac - cording to my experience. It will grow in poor soil where many other species will not grow, and will stand extremely wet or dry weather. I sowed my first bromegrass nine years ago in the spring of the year, seeding half a bushel of oats, a little sweet clover, and about ten pounds of brome per acre. You can sow all the way from ten to twenty pounds per acre. If thin at first it will soon thicken up. We have been told to bow it early in the spring on a firm seedbed. Give the field a little discing if your ground is heavy, harrow it well so the tiny root can get a good start before the warm spring rains. If it gets a start, it will live through the summer regardless of how dry it is. I think fall seeding is satisfactory, but we do not lose as much time in seeding in the spring with oats. We prefer mixing in some alfalfa and sweet clover also. That is a real mixture. There are many ways of seeding, but it is pretty hard to sow broadcast and sow lightly. And if brome is planted it withstands under my conditions and kills out other plants. I have spent nine years trying to find out more about the grass and I am well pleased with it. I have a letter from a seed company saying that fifty-three years ago they imported some from Russia, sixty thou - sand pounds of brome and for a number of years the demand increased to about a half million pounds in a half year, and then the demand dropped off. People were anxious to raise grain and plowed up all of their grass. Even in the sandhills they had to plow up good grass which they wish they had back. I sowed some brome in the spring of 1933, and when the drouth came along in 1934 I thought it would die because I sowed it with sweet clover and oats. The oats died and about half of the sweet clover. The brome got a start early in the spring and lived through and made nice pasture this spring. I harvested twenty-five bushels of oats per acre so - it really was not time wasted. I let it grow then that fall until later in the season. We had a hailstorm before the seed was ripe and got ninety per cent loss on it. But it was just real pasture after that hailstorm. When July and August came along it was too hot and dry and nothing grew. We had some rains later in August and it started up. I took the cattle off, gave it a chance to grow because it was the first year and I didn't want to be too hard on it. The next spring it came out surpris - ingly well. We can have a little more pasture and a few more cattle and produce and consume a little more of the grain we raise. If the land can be farmed, let us start a new pasture and then break up the old pasture and keep up soil fertility. I don't believe I can put on as much growth on the cattle with corn as I can with brome. In this way it saves high priced feed. </seg>
            <seg id="p222">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE USING ALFALFA AND BROME IN PASTURE MIXTURES By T. B. BOWMAN, Albion Alfalfa was Introduced in Boone county in the early nineties, and bromegrass (Bromus inermls) about 1900. We found that the brome did better as time went on, due, I think, to it's becoming acclimated and to the improvement in our methods of handling it. In raising brome, first of importance is to get good home grown seed; next is to prepare a good seedbed, and then to have favorable weather conditions. In planning a pasture, I prefer to make long range plans as I know I shall need good pasture in six, eight, or ten years just as it is needed now. So I prepare the land to raise hay for the next two to five years. Then it makes a good pasture for four or five years longer, which makes a convenient and economical hay and pasture program. We are engaged primarily in raising horses, and consider the first cutting alfalfa and brome the very best horse hay obtainable. The first cutting grows taller than the alfalfa, but the second is not so tall. We usually leave the third for winter pasture. Brome may be sown with alfalfa at any time of the year, but I prefer to sow it in the spring or fall. For spring sowing I prefer to double disc a stalk field and then work it down with a harrow. Then sow the seed and harrow or roll it in, leaving the ground well packed with the seed in shallow ground. In spring seeding, two to three pecks of oats or barley may be sown with the pasture mixture for a nurse crop, and this should be cut for hay while in bloom so it will not sap the ground. This makes very good hay. For fall seeding, two pecks of wheat or rye may be sown with the mixture. This makes excellent hay if cut early. The ground should be plowed early and shallow, after which it should be thoroughly packed with a harrow or roller. A well packed seedbed is very necessary at all times for light seed. The borne seed may be sown by hand or sown with an endgate seeder if a man stands near with a green stick to assist the seed in feeding down. Heavy seed like the 1935 crop will sow fairly well in an endgate seeder. It is a good idea to mix about one and one-half quarts of sweet clover with every bushel of alfalfa. The sweet clover dies at the end of the Becond year, leaving the soil loose and in better condition to take water. The brome thrives on the nitrogen produced by the alfalfa and sweet clover. </seg>
            <seg id="p223">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS 1 ASSOCIATION Broine Replaces Thin Alfalfa Stand If it is desired to use the land for pasture in two or three years, sow about eight pounds of alfalfa and fourteen to twenty pounds of brome per acre. If you do not expect to pasture for about six years, you may sow 'more alfalfa and less brome. The brome will not kill the alfalfa. It spreads from seed as well as roots and fills in the thin places when the alfalfa dies out and so you have grass instead of weeds. Brome starts as soon as the ground is thawed in the spring and grows as long as it has moisture. It is usually about two or three weeks earlier than alfalfa, so by the time the alfalfa is big enough that it might bloat the cattle, the brome grass is big enough for them to eat. The cattle like the bromegrass a little better than the alfalfa, so there is very little danger of bloat in cattle if they are kept full of the mixture. This pasture mixture will pasture twice as many horses or cattle as bluejrrass or prairie grass on the same number of acres. Many of the bluegrass and prairie pastures were killed by the drouth of 1934. It rained on August 25, and before October 1 the bromegrass was large enough to pasture and it made good early pasture in the spring of 1935. Bromegrass is very efficient in preventing erosion and very good for washover land because it will grow through several inches of mud. Question: How would bromegrass do in the western part of the state? Mr. Bowman : I think it will do all right where it has moisture. Probably it would be a little hard to start on land that would blow. It would probably be better than any other cultivated grass except possibly crested wheatgrass. Question: Would it be all right to scatter the seed now on pasture that has died out? Mr. Bowman: I would rather say not. It is better on land that has been worked into a good seedbed. We haven't been very success - ful in putting it on old pastures unless the pasture is plowed. Question: Does it make a good growth during dry months? Mr. Bowman: It stops growing in the summer. Question: How many years is it good for? Mr. Bowman: I have one field eleven years old. I have seen it as ■old as twenty years. I have one field eleven years old that we pastured some in the spring and right over the tops of the hills grass grew from two to three feet high. Then it didn't grow very much until rain in the fall, when it started growing again. </seg>
            <seg id="p224">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE NORTHERN NEBRASKA PASTURE COMBINATIONS By WALTER R. CHACE, Stanton, Nebr. This talk will be a discussion of possible pasture combinations that are practical in northeastern Nebraska. Due to the common practice of over-grazing,, and more especially because of the drouth of the last few years, our pastures in northeast Nebraska are mostly in very poor condition. What are we, as farmers, going to do about it? We have three courses that might be followed, namely: (1) We might plant entirely new permanent pastures. (2) We might try to rejuvenate the old ones. (3) Or we might plan a new system of combinations. It is on this last point that I am going to give you some of my experiences. How many of you find that at some time during the summer you are almost without pasture for your livestock? It is to do away with this hazard that a combination of temporary and permanent pastures has been worked out on my farm of 480 acres. Possibly such a scheme is not so practical on the average quarter section, but I believe it could be used to advantage. The plan adopted is to use a combination of four pastures that are accessible to the buildings and any one of them can be used without the others. For instance, from a lane leading from the buildings, gates could be opened into any field desired. The diagram on next page illustrates the respective fields. and the crops sown on each one. The general idea is this: rye pasture is used early in the spring and at all times (except in rainy weather) up until it starts to shoot stems, which generally occurs some time in May. Since the sudan grass is not planted until June, I have been using a flller-in to cover the period between the rye pasture and the sudan pasture. Small Grain for May and June Pasture This year I experimented with all three of the small grains men - tioned trying to determine which one made the best temporary pasture. I planted all three side by side in the "C" field and watched the cattle to determine results. They seemed to prefer the rye that was planted in the spring, but it did not make as much growth as the oats or barley. Next they preferred the oats, and last the barley. The barley, how- </seg>

As soon as this pasture has been utilized, if there is a good stand of sweet clover it csLn be left for late fall pasture, or it can be plowed up and put to late corn or sorgo. Lastly, the sudan pasture is used during the hot dry months when most permanent pastures are not much good, but be careful that the gate is permanently closed after the first heavy frost. Use Permanent Pasture While Soil Is Very Wet The permanent pasture fills a much needed place in this combin - ation in that it can be used during rainy weather when livestock would ruin temporary pastures and it can be used whenever the other pastures do not dovetail together, or need a week's rest to get a new start. In conclusion, I believe that the time and effort expended in putting </seg>
            <seg id="p226">REPORT OK NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE in these temporary fences and work of preparing the different pas - tures pays big dividends because you are almost assured of continuous good pasture and a much larger number of livestock can be carried per acre of pasture. SOME SUCCESSFUL, PASTURE PRACTICES I HAVE OBSERVED by ARTHUR PETERSON, Assistant Extension Agronomist Today, I should like to give you some of the results of the 1935 Pasture Contest. This Contest was started last spring. The purpose of the Contest was to give publicity and to call attention to the need for better pasture management. It was also hoped that some beneficial information would be obtained on various carrying capacities of different pastures, both temporary and permanent. The Pasture Con - test of 1935 has now been brought to a close, and the information gained from it is available. In the first place, let us review some of the highlights of this enter - prise. Four hundred and twenty-six farmers representing fifty-two counties were entered in the Contest. These four hundred and twenty - six farmers entered in three divisions, namely, Division I — Temporary Pastures; Division II — Rebuilding of Permanent Pastures; and Division III — Seeding New Permanent Pastures. Those farmers entered in Divi - sions I and II completed their reports this year. There were two hundred and fifty-one farmers who completed reports in the divisions named. One of the highlights of the 19!! 5 Pasture Contest was the finish-up banquet held at Omaha, December 17th, at which the county awards and state awards were made. In Division I, one of the outstanding temporary rotations used was that of rye, sweet clover and sudan grass. From the temporary pasture reports, we have gathered the data on how many farmers used rye for pasture, how many used sudan, how many used second-year sweet clover, first-year sweet clover and other temporary pastures. We have also made a summary of the time that they started pasturing and the time they concluded pasturing these various crops. The sum - mary of the Pasture Contest may be obtained by those interested from the Agronomy Department of the University of Nebraska. From data gathered in this contest and from previous experiences of farmers we find that one of the main points in the management of permanent pas - tures is to give the pasture some rest in the spring. \ Rye is very valu - able in case a farmer is attempting to do this. From our data in the Pasture Contest, we find that the average date that farmers pasture rye is April 1st in eastern Nebraska, and that they can carry cattle on rye pasture from this point on until around July 1st. However, we find that it is quite a common practice for farmers to pasture their rye </seg>
            <seg id="p227">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS 1 ASSOCIATION" until the first part of May, when their second-year sweet clover is available, and go ahead and harvest the rye crop from their rye pas - ture. This can also be done with wheat if Hessian fly is not a problem. Second-year sweet clover again proved to be outstanding in carrying capacity during the months of May, June, and the first part of July. We find that a number of contestants that ranked high in the contest used second-year sweet clover for pasture during May and part of June and then in many cases were able to harvest some seed from the sweet clover. Notable cases are those of Mr. Joe Sedlak of Shelby, Nebraska, and C. W. Bergh of Plainview, Nebraska. Both of these men, in my opinion, have outstanding examples of temporary pasture rotations, and in both cases, these men pastured second-year sweet clover and also harvested a good crop of sweet clover seed from it. Second-year sweet clover is, of course, better adapted to the eastern third of the state than to the western part of the state. Kuiiy Seeding of Sweet Clover Better In spite of the difficulty which farmers have with sweet clover causing bloat, we find many of them using it in Nebraska. During the two years 1934 and 1935, some farmers experienced difficulty in getting a stand. Those that did get stands, however, found that sweet clover is one of the most drouth-resistant plants in its second year of life that we have. It also produces a high yield during the period of growth when it is being pastured. One of the best examples of seeding sweet clover under difficulties that I know of in the Contest, was that of C. W. Bergh of Plainview. Mr. Bergh lives on a farm in Antelope county, which, like many farms in the northern part of that county, is very sandy. Most of his neighbors have given up growing sweet clover because of their inability to obtain stands. However, this year Mr. Bergh had a fine field of second-year sweet clover, planted in the spring of 1934 from which he harvested seed after pasturing it for a considerable period. He also had in his stubble field, this fall, a very excellent stand of sweet clover planted this spring. The two principles - which he practices and which I believe are largely responsible for his success are (1) he plants the sweet clover on top of the ground by - broadcasting the sweet clover with a drill as he plants his small grain: (2) he seeds his sweet clover very early in the spring. In the Contest, we found that those who planted their sweet clover either the latter part of March or early in April had much better success than those who planted later. Some farmers had fall planted sweet clover which behaves as second-year sweet clover the following season. Seed Sudan Ijiiter Sudan grass was used in the Contest largely as an emergency pas - ture. It proved to be drouth-resistant, and for this reason it has a </seg>
            <seg id="p228">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE place in Nebraska. We found that some of the men in the Contest are planting sudan in rows for pasture, some of them planting it with a •corn planter, leaving it the width of the planter row apart; others are splitting the rows, making them half as wide as the corn planter rows. This seems to me to be especially satisfactory in the South Platte territory. To my knowledge there is no one in the Pasture Contest ■who experienced difficulty with prussic acid poisoning from sudan grass. We also found that in the contest those farmers who delayed planting their sudan grass until around the first part of June and then gave it a good start, usually delaying pasturing about five weeks, had a much better pasture than those men who started pasturing earlier ■or who attempted to seed early in the spring. Sudan grass, being one •of the sorghums, needs a very warm seedbed, and for this reason should not be planted early in the spring. I think that most any farmer •can afford to have a few acres of this crop to use for an emergency pas - ture. If he does not need it, he can harvest it for hay and forage, or in some cases harvest it for seed. One of the important problems of pas - ture management that we should emphasize is the fact that most farm - ■ers do not provide enough pasture for the number of livestock they attempt to carry. In other words, they base the amount of pasture that they need on the good years, rather than on an average or poor year. And, after all, the man who has pasture in a poor year is the one who usually gets the greatest returns from his pasture ground over a period of years. Legumes and Grasses for Mixtures In eastern Nebraska, first-year sweet clover in the stubble furnishes considerable pasture. We find that in most of Nebraska, especially in northeastern Nebraska, it is a general practice among farmers to use their stubble ground for pasture. In certain sections of Nebraska, such as Gage county, we find that sweet clover does not on the whole do as well as in some other sections, partially due to the fact that the soil being of a glacial type is slightly acid. However, in that section, we also find that Korean lespedeza has some possibilities. It is inter - esting to note how widely Korean lespedeza is being used in Missouri. However, from results in this state, it is not as valuable as sweet clover, and except in the southeastern part of the state we are not recommend - ing it for pasture mixtures. A few farmers in the Contest used alfalfa for pasture. It is rather surprising how many farmers have used alfalfa, and many of them with good success. We find, of course, that alfalfa is as dangerous or possibly more so than some of the other legumes. However, in Lan - caster county we have Otto Becker, who has pastured alfalfa for ap - proximately thirty years. In pasturing alfalfa, as in pasturing sweet clover, certain precautions seem to decrease the amount of bloat. For </seg>
            <seg id="p229">NEBRASKA CUOP GROWEKK' ASSOCIATION instance, it is very risky to turn the animals on when they are empty. For this reason, those farmers who pasture legumes such as sweet clover or alfalfa usually attempt to have the animals well filled when they first start them on this pasture. Some farmers use grasses with alfalfa pasture, such as bluegrass; however, since bromegrass out - yields bluegrass, we suggest that they plant bromegrass with their alfalfa. We have heard today from Mr. Bowman whose experience in the use of alfalfa and bromegrass as a pasture mixture is very interesting. Another factor of importance in the question of bloat is that the animals have easy access to a plentiful supply of water. Some farmers also emphasize the point that plenty of salt should be easily available to the stock. Alfalfa pasture proved to be very valuable in an emergency in the year 1934 and in some cases in 1935. I predict that it will increase in popularity in this state. In rebuilding permanent pastures, some farmers in the Contest seeded into their old pastures, and many of them brought their old pastures back by merely giving them a rest. We have discussed the use of temporary pastures, and it would seem that one of the principal purposes for temporary pastures would be to give the old permanent pastures a rest so that food storage in the roots can be increased and from this standpoint their use and economic return made greater. One of the greatest sins that I found committed by farmers in the pasture work, and I think most of them will acknowledge it, is that they over - pastured their fields. This, of course, can be avoided by providing larger pastures or by supplementing permanent pastures with tem. - porary pastures. Rebuild Pastures with Clover and Orchard Grass Contest results indicate that seeding sweet clover into permanent Ragweeds shoulder high in a southeastern Nebraska blucgrass pasture which was killed out by the 1934 drouth. This will be a worthless field until steps are taken to re-establish pasture grasses. </seg>
            <seg id="p230">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE HOARD OF AGRICULTURE pastures is one of the best ways to improve them. Sweet clover seems to catch better and I believe will prove more satisfactory in rebuilding and providing feed in pastures than any other crop. It increases the nitrogen content, and as you know, the nitrogen content has a stimula - tive influence on the growth of grasses. It would be my opinion that in these pastures where sweet clover has been established, the grass in 1937 and 1938 will increase in stand and be much more vigorous. To some extent, I think alfalfa can be used in rebuilding old permanent pastures. . One of the outstanding grasses we found this year that caught easily in spite of the dry weather in July and August, was orchard grass. This was somewhat surprising since orchard grass has been generally recommended for shady places. However, in several cases in the pasture content, I can show you illustrations where orchard grass and sweet clover were sole survivors of a rather complicated mixture. Orchard grass in its ability to catch seemed to be superior to bromegrass and bromegrass far superior to bluegrass. Orchard grass, being a bunch grass, will also withstand considerable drouth. However, it is not as palatable as some of our other grasses. It has also proved to be satisfactory in shady places. At Tekamah, Ne - braska, on the farm of Viggo Kjelgaard, orchard grass was planted in a grove. This grove was so dense that previously nothing but weeds would grow. Mr. Kjelgaard now has an excellent stand of orchard grass which improves the appearance of the grove and also provides considerable pasture. You have heard considerable discussion here today by men who have grown bromegrass. It hardly behooves me to add anything to the things that have been mentioned, except to say that I "second the motion." Bromegrass should increase in popularity in this state be - cause it will outyield bluegrass and other tame grasses that we now have for pasture. I believe one of our best pasture mixtures would be bromegrass, alfalfa, sweet clover, and orchard grass. The propor - tion of these and their local adaptation will vary, of course, with the section of the country and also with the type of land on which it is to be used. And now in closing, I should like to make a few suggestions on pastures based on information gained from the 1935 Pasture Contest.,,. In the first place, I believe that our pasturing season can be greatly increased by using temporary and permanent pasture to greater ad - vantage. For example, if farmers plant rye fairly early in the fall, they have some chance of getting a little fall pasture from the rye. At any rate, they should have pasture from the rye by the first of April. They could then use their rye pasture through the month of April and a part of May, and if they wished, could harvest a fairly </seg>
            <seg id="p231">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION good crop of rye from the pasture. During the month of May, most farmers have used second-year sweet clover to some extent. In fact, we find that it is the practice of some farmers, especially in the northeastern part of the state to pas - ture second-year sweet clover for the first part of May, then plow it up and put it into corn. I believe, in the ordinary year, that this will work out satisfactorily. Second-year sweet clover will carry a con - siderable number of cattle through May, June, and early July. White sweet clover will carry for a longer period than yellow, although it will not reseed as readily as yellow. The best practice might be to use rye in the early part of the year and sweet clover if needed. However, during the period of the last part of May and through June, the use of the permanent pasture, either bromegrass or bluegrass is to be recommended. I think then, that during the dry part of the summer, we should plan on using sudan grass in this pasture rotation which I am describing. Sudan grass planted about the first of June should be available for pasture about the middle of July, and from then on through the month of August should provide sufficient pasture. Through the last part of August and September a good pasture can be produced from first-year sweet clover. By the first part of October and part of November a farmer should have rye pasture if it is planted early. Then I think that rather than use the permanent pasture growth in the fall, like many of us do, it would be a good practice to allow the permanent pasture to grow up and use it for winter pasture. In this way, I believe that it is possible to have a pasturing season in Nebraska from the first of April until at least the last of November and possibly into December. I believe the possibilities of pasture management have only been touched and that we will find that farmers will increase the amount of pasture days that they receive from their farms by such methods as I have indicated. Through such a contest as we have had this year, interest in pasture management will be created and new pasture grasses and legumes will probably be dis - covered. If we can accomplish nothing more than to bring to the at - tention of farmers the importance of proper pasture management and the advantages of making their plans for the future, I think our work has been worthwhile. I appreciate the cooperation of those who have worked with me on the 1935 Pasture Contest, and I certainly hope that the Contest will be continued in 1936. </seg>
            <seg id="p232">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE SUMMARY OF THE 1033 NEBRASKA ANNUAL PASTURE CONTEST ARTHUR PETERSON and P. H. STEWART Nebraska pastures were in a serious condition in the fall of 1934 as a result of both continued drouth and general overgrazing. Although the whole state was affected, the bluegrass pastures of the eastern sec - tion were hardest hit. With these facts in mind a pasture contest was being tentatively planned for 1935 by the Extension Agronomists when they were ap - proached by the Omaha Chamber of Commerce relative to a cooperative project on the pasture improvement work. After a series of confer - ences with the Agricultural Committee of the Omaha Chamber of Coommerce plans were devised for the first Nebraska Pasture Contest. In cooperation with the interested agencies such as the Omaha Chamber of Commerce and the Nebraska Crop Growers' Association, a circular outlining the contest and containing timely pasture questions and answers was prepared. 55,000 copies were printed and distributed. This circular was sent by the Federal Land Bank to all its borrowers. The Burlington and Union Pacific railroads and the Fairmont Cream - ery Company also distributed quite a number. The state pasture committee consisting of E. C. Scheidenhelm, Extension Dairyman; Walter Tolman, Extension Animal Husbandman; Dr. F. D. Keim, Agronomist; P. H. Stewart, D. L. Gross, and A. W. Peterson, Extension Agronomists; acted as judges in scoring the vari - ous reports. A. W. Peterson acted as field representative of the com - mittee and together with agricultural agents and county pasture com - mittees visited pasture contestants.

Leonard Loftis, Herman Observations in Division I The winners in Division I used combinations of temporary pastures including such crops as rye for early spring pasture, second year sweet clover for early summer, sudan for midsummer and first year sweet clover and rye for fall pasture. By using this kind of a rotation these winners were able to pasture more than two head per acre for a period of six months. Several harvested seed from their surplus second year sweet clover. Quite a large number harvested some rye after pasturing it in early spring, while others cut part of their sudan for hay. The important thing is that they had more pasture than they actually needed and in case of an emergency such as drouth could have used it. Bloat is always a problem when pasturing legumes. In spite of this a few of the contestants actually pastured pure stands of alfalfa. </seg>
            <seg id="p234">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Some of them report that this has been their practice for as long as twenty-five years. Most of them pasture the alfalfa when it is fairly mature during the months of July and August. By using grain or hay as supplementary feeds the danger of bloat is reduced. Never turn - ing the animals on when hungry, providing salt and an easily accessible water supply are mentioned frequently by farmers as helping to pre - vent bloat. Dry feed such as straw or hay seems to be of some value. It is also suggested by farmers who have tried it that combining a grass and legume cuts down on the bloat danger. In this connection an inter - esting practice was followed by a few contestants. In the fall they seeded into their first sweet clover field, about 1 bushel of rye to the acre. The next spring they had pasture about a month earlier than they would have had from the sweet clover alone. Then when the second year sweet clover came on, the combination of rye and sweet clover tended to reduce bloat. This practice should be tried by more farmers in the eastern % of the state, when trouble from sweet clover bloat is most likely to occur. Full Planted Sweet Clover Sweet clover planted in the fall of 1934 was observed in some of the contestant's pastures. In 193 5 it developed as second year sweet clover and provided a lot of summer pasture. This practice appears to be practical, because if the spring seeding fails, a fall planting may be tried. It also adds to the value of sweet clover for fall seeding in pasture mixtures. The sweet clover should be sown at the time alfalfa is normally fall seeded in order to become well established before fall growth ceases. Crops Used Of the 80 farmers entered in Division I, 63 used rye, 49 used sudan, 29 used first year sweet clover, 26 used second year sweet clover, 20 used oats, and 15 used winter wheat.

            <seg id="p235">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION I was 262. This is equivalent to carrying 1% animal units per acre lor six months. Compared with this the 20 high ranking contestants had an average of 477 pasture days per acre or the equivalent of 2 2/5 animal units per acre for a period of 6 months. Observations in Division II Working Old Pastures Before Seeding Rebuilding of old permanent pastures was attempted by 170 farmers in the contest. There were a number of points brought out by these farm demonstrations that are worth noting. One important question often asked is should an old pasture be worked before seeding into it? Seventy-one of the contestants who seeded made no land preparation before seeding their pastures. Thirty-one farmers disked their pastures once, 19 disked twice and 3 used a spike tooth harrow to prepare a seed bed. In general the farmers that worked their pas - tures in one way or another got better stands of the new grasses and legumes. Working the old pasture sod seemed to benefit rather than harm the old stand of grass. Therefore, on the results of this year's contest, working the pastures before seeding with some implement like a disk seems advisable. Research work in other states bears out this recommendation. Seeding Grass and Legume Mixtures Of the thirteen different kinds of grasses and legumes seeded, two appeared outstanding in their ability to catch in old pastures. They were orchard grass and sweet clover. Sweet clover also adds nitrogen, a valuable element to stimulate grass recovery. The table below gives the results: So.

John DeWitt Roseland, Nebraska 4. L. R. Eby Hartington, Nebraska These tests were seeded at the rate of 15# of legumes and 20# of grasses per acre. The spring seeded tests were observed in order to get some idea of stand and seedling appearance. Later these tests will be pastured to observe palatability, adaptation, etc. Here again orchard grass and sweet clover showed superior stands the first year. Delayed Grazing Seventy-two of the 170 farmers in Division II delayed grazing; 9 did not pasture at all. In many cases delayed grazing is all that is needed to bring back the permanent pastures. In the contest, this proved especially effective on native pastures and is highly recom - mended for the South Platte territory where as yet tame grass seed - ings have not proved very practical. It seems from the results of this contest that using fall rye for early spring pasture to relieve permanent pastures and give them a chance to get a good start is good pasture management, Many contestants went further than this and used a field of sudan to supplement permanent pastures through July and August. In the South Platte territory some farmers tried seeding sudan in rows as much as 42 inches apart, the idea being conservation of seed and planting the seed in moist soil. No definite conclusion can be drawn, but this undoubtedly has possibilities in a drouth year and may prove practical since the sudan can be easily harvested as a forage crop if not needed for pasture. </seg>
            <seg id="p237">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION Mowing Pastures Ninety contestants mowed their pastures at least once. Where new grasses had been seeded into old pastures it proved disastrous to 'the new seedlings to mow weeds during the hot part of July and August. Several excellent demonstrations of the effect of date of mowing were observed. In general it would seem advisable to mow pastures about the middle of June. Ordinarily, many annual weeds are in bloom and several pasture perennials are low in food storage at this time so that a mowing is effective in destroying both of these types of weeds. From a practical standpoint it can be said that the pressure of farm work often delays mowing, causing neglect of pastures. However, there are probably times when mowing the pasture pays bigger returns than other farm work. Some of the contestants also showed good results by mowing their pastures again in late August. Brome Grass and Alfalfa Of all the established grasses in eastern Nebraska pastures, brome grass showed outstanding qualities. It proved drouth resistant, cold resistant and also seemed to be able to stand flooding for short periods of time. In yield those farmers using it rated it well above bluegrass or native pasture. Its main weakness seems to be "sod binding." Contestants felt that this could be overcome by disking, manuring or seeding in legumes. It appears that sod binding may be caused by a lack of available nitrogren and the methods mentioned above should help in overcoming this condition. From observations made in the pasture work this year it is suggested that brome-alfalfa mixtures be given further trial. There is very little doubt about the yielding ability of such a combination. Alfalfa should help the carrying capacity during July and August and should delay the "sod binding" problem. Alfalfa may cause bloat, but it is thought that the presence of a large per - centage of Brome (at least 507c) will minimize this danger. Further observation of this combination should be made. Judging from past experiences of farmers, there is little doubt, but that Brome will crowd out most grasses and legumes.

            <seg id="p238">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE stations and the U. S. Department of Agriculture have been carrying on experiments in gardens and field plots. Progress has been slow until recently, however, owing in part to lack of public interest and support. Of the 1,100 different kinds of grasses native in the United States some 4 00 have probably been grown in grass gardens and field plots for observation sometime in the last forty years. Of this number, seed of only two is available in commercial quantities today. These are slender wheatgrass, best suited to conditions in the northern Great Plains, and western wheatgrass which is an ideal hay grass for certain areas of heavy soil in the drier parts of the central Great Plains.

Present Needs for Large Quantities of Grass Seed of Species Adapted to the Great Plains During the last three years the program of national conservation has focused the public attention on the need for conserving our soils and the need of solving the problem of land taken out o£ crop production. Since it has been found at several of the state and federal soil con - servation experiment stations that soil loss from erosion is at a mini - mum under a cover of grass or a combination of grass and trees, there has been a growing feeling that much land too steep or too poor for profitable cultivation should go back to grass or trees. In the eastern, half of the country and probably as far west as the eastern one third of such Plains States as North and South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, and Oklahoma, either trees, shrubs, or grasses whose seed is com - mercially available can be used effectively in the soil conservation program. However, there are vast areas in the western sections of the Plains States where only a very limited number of kinds of trees and shrubs can be used and a still more limited number of grasses whose seed is commercially available. Research at the Northern Great Plains Field Station, Division of Dry Land Agriculture, U. S. Depart - ment of Agriculture, Mandan, N. Dak., and at the Agricultural Experi - ment Stations of Montana, N. Dak., and Wyoming has shown that crested wheatgrass, slender wheatgrass, and brome grass fulfill most of the grass seed needs of the program of soil conservation in the northern. Great Plains. These three grasses have some value as far south as Nebraska, but none of these is suited to the long hot dry summers ot the southern Great Plains, or the Southwest. Since some of the worst wind erosion in the last few years has been in just those areas where seed of well-adapted grasses is not available, several agencies of the U. S. Department of Agriculture have been active in developing an adequate seed supply of certain of the more promising native grasses of the Great Plains and the Southwest. A start on developing an adequate seed supply of native plains grasses was made in 1934, but since this was one of the driest years in history little progress was made. The summer and fall of 1935 was unusually favorable for a crop of native grass seed and at the end of the season the grass unit of the nursery division of the Soil Conserva- </seg>

Since most of these grasses, with the exception of western wheatgrass, had never been harvested in large amounts before, the cooperation, ingenuity and labor of a large number of men was used. The machinery used in this harvest varied with the type of seed harvested. Combines and headers were used for the most part but binders, mowers, and power seed strippers were also used. t^WSfewr* l mxJ**^~WwW^'~^^B0**^ ■-■ -•:'■•-•■-■ - I These power grass strippers were built for the soil Conservation Service by Miles Minehan, Amelia, Nebraska. They were particularly useful in harvesting seeil of the bluestems, switchgrass, and grama. In Nebraska, harvesting operations were carried on at Oshkosh, where 4,300 pounds of alkali dropseed were obtained, at Morrill where 1,020 pounds of Indian rice grass were harvested and in the vicinity of O'Neill, where 58,776 pounds of seed of 13 kinds of native grasses were harvested, mostly big and little bluestem, blue grama and switchgrass. During the last two years the Soil Conservation Service has also been active in collecting small quantities of seed and plants of a large number of native grasses and growing them in test nurseries throughout the United States. Even though the results of these tests are still preliminary, many possibilities have become apparent. For instance aX the Ames, Iowa nursery it was found that slougbgrass, a very tough- </seg>

Four phases of the plans to develop more and better grasses for Nebraska so far as the wider use of native grasses in Nebraska is con - cerned, there are four clearly denned phases. The initial one will be the establishment of an extensive testing and demonstration grass garden at Lincoln and at North Platte similar to the one recently discontinued at Ames, Iowa. During the coming spring and summer, some 325 species of grasses will be grown for observation. Plants which have the best hay, pasture, and soil conservation values will be selected and their seed increased for testing in the several problem areas of the State. A second phase of the program will be the adequate field. testing of the most promising species developed at the Lincoln and North Platte nurseries.

The third phase in which the Soil Conservation Service and the Division of Forage Crops and Diseases, U. S. Department of Agriculture and the Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station will cooperate is the development of a state-wide program of selection and propagation of locally adapted varieties of perennial hay and pasture grasses. As a part of this phase selections and tests will probably be made of brome grass, blue grass, meadow fescue, red top, big and little bluestem, .switch grass, Indian grass, blue grama, and western wheatgrass. The fourth phase will be the development of adequate seed supplies of selected strains of these grasses and their introduction to farmers and ranchers throughout the State. The mechanics of finding the easiest, cheapest and best ways of increasing adapted strains will be part of the work of the Soil Conservation Service Nurseries while that of introducing new and better varieties will be left to other agencies. THE PART OP GRASS IN THE HUSBANDMAN'S PROGRAM By DUNCAN MARSHALL, Toronto, Canada I am afraid anything that I have to say about grass and pastures would perhaps scarcely apply to some parts or districts of the state of Nebraska. For, after all, the question of raising grass or producing pasture depends to a great extent, as you all know, upon the soil and climate. There can be no doubt that grass is the greatest plant. With - out grass there would be no farms. Without grass there would be no animal husbandry or food for human beings. Grass is the essential thing on the farm. In Scotland they are getting away from permanent pastures alto - gether, and men investigating there the last few years find that it is better to have a rotation with grasses and with pastures as with every - thing else. There used to be a pride in England and Scotland that land that had been down to grass for one hundred years, and that these fields had been pastured continually for that length of time. So far as grass in Canada is concerned, I have come to three or four very definite conclusions about it. One is, that when you are going to seed down a pasture, you should have your land better prepared for that than for anything else. You know there used to be an idea in •early farming in certain localities by those who had never been on a farm that when a field got so poor it couldn't grow mullen, they would seed it to grass and waste two or three years trying to get a stand. </seg>
            <seg id="p243">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION I had a chance to observe the very opposite of it. My father was a Scotch farmer who came to Ontario, and if there was any land that he wanted to get in the very best possible condition it was the land he was going to seed to hay or grass. He would spread all barnyard manure he could and he always fed grain to everything that was on the farm so he had a generous supply of it. The land to be seeded was prepared and properly enriched. And he sowed the kind of grass that would keep the weeds from growing and would give results. In England and Scotland they are getting away to some extent from permanent pastures. There is one crop that has done that, and that is wild white clover. I have found no one here who grows it successfully. I think perhaps there are some parts in lower New York or Virginia where it may be grown. I have tried it one or two or three times without success, but wild white clover is the greatest pasture grass in the world. Talk about gray or blue or other kinds of grass, but they don't amount to anything compared to wild white clover. I am not depreciating for a minute the value and importance of science in agriculture, because it is the foundation of all the progress and all the success we have made. The men who gave Marquis wheat to the Dominion made it the greatest gift that was made to agriculture in our country, at least. So every once in a while men discover some of these things — and it takes quite a while to discover anything worth while — but when they do, it is great value to agriculture. In England and Scotland they try to produce as much beef and milk on the grass as possible. A Scotchman will tell you when they are able to pull their own feed they are the most valuable. He tries to arrange his plans in order to have most of his cattle fatten on the grass; and I have seen steers putting on 3 Vi pounds per day on a grass pas - ture and not getting any other feed but what they pulled themselves. Wild white clover is a sort of straw, very fine affair, running along the ground. As a matter of fact, it is so fine that when it first comes up you have to get down on your hands and knees to hunt for it. In sowing 42 pounds to the acre of grass, no farmer in England sows more than 2 or 3 pounds of wild white clover. While he sows only 2 or 3 pounds of wild white clover and the grass is down for 3 years, the wild white clover will have taken everything. The seed has sold at perhaps very excessive prices. I bought a quarter of a bag from a man when I was in Scotland on one of my trips over 15 years ago, and I don't remember quite how many pounds were in it, but it wasn't half a bag and it cost me $92. You are talking today about dry pastures. Some people have been speaking about permanent pastures. T. A. Russell who is well known at the International Show, has been a distributor of Shorthorns for </seg>
            <seg id="p244">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE many years. He has solved this problem so far as his purebred raising is concerned. He grows a lot of alfalfa, sometimes mixed with alsike and timothy, for his hay. He cuts some of it from one or two fields as early as he possibly can, almost before it is in bloom and it makes the best kind of hay. The other pastures dry up and he turns his cattle onto this second growth of alfalfa. He never has any difficulty with bloat. It is important that cows should milk. Some say this method of pasturing has given milk for his purebred calves in finer fashion than anything he has yet discovered in the Province of Ontario. I lived for years in western Canada and in the district where I lived we were not bothered with pasture as there was plenty of open prairie. "We had dry prairie hay. It looked like there would be no nourishment in it at all. Of course the prairie pastures were all right if you had enough of them. It compared well with the finest grasses that we could find. And dur - ing the eighteen years that I was farming in the province of Alberta I had a sufficient amount of this kind of pasture; in fact, most of the hay to winter my cattle was cut off of prairie of this kind. The country was only sparsely settled and as a result no artificial pasture was necessary. In southern Alberta, you will all remember Mr. George Lane, whose name was known in the Percheron world both in Canada and the United States, for at one time having the largest herd of Percheron horses anywhere — over 250 breeding mares on the Bar U ranch. He plowed his prairie land near the buildings and put down bromegrass pasture for his horses. He was very successful and had the best kind of pas - ture in a semi-arid land. He found these pastures for his cattle, parti - cularly for his young stallions and one- and two-year-olds, the best pasture he could get. Without grass it is very difficult to do any farming of any conse - quence whatever. Farmers in certain sections of the prairie land in our country engage entirely in wheat farming. But wherever you get into anything in the nature of mixed farming which means livestock, it is necessary to have grass and hay. Our experience in England and Scotland and Canada now is that, with the exception of a low lying field that isn't adapted to the growing of grass, it is advantageous to have a rotation of grasses as well as a rotation of grains. Somebody said it was a good plan to keep your cattle off the grass too early in the spring, and with him I most heartily agree. My father never turned a beast out before the 24th of May. It didn't make any difference how high the grass was, that made no difference. The 24th of May was his day, and the grass was always high enough before they went out so that they could always get a good bite at the bottom. </seg>
            <seg id="p245">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS 1 ASSOCIATION I was over there in 1930 and he was paying 25 pounds an acre rental for grass pasture. That is ?125 an acre for the summer's rent of a grass pasture, and he was making money out of it, if you please. He had just leased a new field of about 40 acres before I arrived there and I asked him why he needed that. "My calves will never be fitted for sale in October if they don't have plenty of grass. I leased it because the man was going to cut the grass. I don't want it cut." There is scarcely a day in Scotland when it doesn't rain some. It ■doesn't rain the same there as it does here. Here it has no sense at all, it just pours down so it washes away the earth from the roots of the grass and flowers and shrubs. And sometimes after one of these rain - storms the condition is really worse than before. The rain in Scot - land falls like a gentle benediction, maybe fifteen minutes, in a sort of mist. Then it will clear up. You will forget that it rained when you look lip at the hills and lakes, and then after a couple of hours, a cloud will come and it will rain again. You will be out without a coat but it won't make any difference. Some days it takes it into its head to rain often, but it never teems down there like it does here. In that country they can grow grass in abundance. The great live - stock men, raisers of purebreds mostly, say they have better live - stock if they always fit them on the grass. William Duffy's sale was always in October. The calves were brought in from the field the day of the sale; they were not haltered and tied in the barn at night, but are always on the grass. William didn't mind paying a few pounds extra for a bit of extra pasture because he had a group of calves that were well worth the money. When it is well worth a man's while to furnish grass like that to his purebred cattle, we can have some idea of how valuable it will be. We don't need to feed it in such abundance to commercial cattle. Cattle that are coming in to Aberdeen were selling at 90 shillings a hundred weight. If you divide four into 90 that is 22 !£ cents a hundred weight. And these are not show cattle, these are the ones to go to the butcher. So the history of these men and the history of their confidence in grass. I have been where there were 90 purebred Ayrshire cows kept. They never milked for more than 40 weeks in the year and they milked it all on the grass, and only just at the start and maybe a little at the windup they were given a little bit of grain. But the Scotchman's idea is that he must milk his cows and feed his beef as well as he can on the grass. All of these men are tenant farmers and they have to pay the rent or get off the land. And when they are up against that kind of a proposition, paying every 12 months, not every 10 years, they make an effort to do the job. Sometimes I think the tenant system isn't bad. It is a case of the survival of the fittest. If he can't make a go of it on the farm </seg>
            <seg id="p246">REPOKT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGklCULTURE he goes to the town, becomes a merchant or lawyer or doctor and he - does pretty well at that kind of thing; but he gets off the land and allows somebody to come on it who can pay the rent and he stays there. I wouldn't give you any statement as to what kinds of grass to sow or how to sow them in the state of Nebraska, having no knowl - edge of conditions here. In the province of Ontario we have worked out a system. Research work on grasses has made more headway The research bureau is working on it. Men have given huge fortunes of their private money to keep research alive. At the Highland Show you will see one of the finest exhibitions, because, while it is a little bit of a place, mostly hills, lakes, rocks, and scenery, with just a few valleys, yet it has produced for the world— Clydesdale horses, Ayr - shires, and Shorthorn cattle, and they have beaten the world in Shrop - shire sheep. Other varieties too have come from England and Scot - land; the best Yorkshire pigs that can be found are in the lowlands of Scotland. Under conditions where only a handful of people are able to engage in the business of farming, they have made livestock a success, and where a man has made livestock successful you can be sure he knows something about grass, for it lies at the very foundation of this success. Grass Is not only at the foundation of all farming but it is at the foundation of all humanity. Agriculture can well afford to spend a good deal of time on this. There is nothing of more benefit to the farmers of Nebraska, to the farmers of any state in the Union, or Canada, than diligent research work to point to them the grasses that will make their farming the most successful and the most profitable. RESERVE ROUGHAGE WHEN PASTURES FAlIi R. R. THALMAN, Department of Animal Husbandry Much has been said during the past two years upon the subject of pastures and farm planning. From the present proposals before Con - gress regarding land utilization, it appears like a great deal more will be said in the future. A study of farming practices is now being made throughout the principal farming states. In some states this study is nearly complete and already recommendations regarding future agricultural practices are in the formative stage. The proposed program is directed toward a cropping system that will build up and maintain at high levels of productivity the farm lands of this country. It is also proposed that many acres of marginal land will be withdrawn from cultivation and will be used as grassland. More acres will also be turned to the production of hay, silage and fodder crops, with grain — especially corn and wheat, taking some reductions. The question before the farmer is what effect will this have upon established agrl- </seg>
            <seg id="p247">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION" cultural practices and how can these new acres of grass and forage crops be converted into cash. Livestock Turn Grass Into Cash A program of this sort means but one thing — an increase in the number of farms supporting livestock. Grass is admittedly one of the best livestock feeds known to man, but it is also one of the most use - less crops where no livestock are available to use it. More livestock upon farms means better farming and a more stable agriculture, the latter being necessary to the continuous welfare of the nation. Live - stock has long been the balance wheel for agriculture in the European countries, and it has through centuries maintained the productivity of the soil. Soil erosion, floods, dust storms, and soil fertility, have made Americans conscious that a livestock program is necessary in this country. Many of our American farmers are, however, not livestock-? minded men. Upon thousands of farms, the only livestock to be found consists of one or two milk cows, and a team or two of horses. Cash grain farming is the rule upon these farms, and these are the units upon which a soil rejuvenation policy is most needed. One of the factors responsible for this condition is the alarming increase in farm tenantry. Upon tenant farms a stable agriculture is difficult with so large a percentage of farm operators not knowing how long they can remain upon a place, and with no assurance that they will ever owjn the farm upon which they are living. The result is a literal exploitation of the soil upon that farm. Any correction of this condition under present leasing systems seems to lie principally with the land owner. This may entail longer leases, more careful selection of tenants, an educational program, or more careful supervision. At any rate, a great many of these farms will support more livestock, especially a cow herd or a farm flock of sheep. The income from home use and the sale of livestock products should more than offset the cost of maintenance. Further, the future of the farm's productivity would not be in jeopardy. The greater acreages of grass and roughage crops upon farms brings the cow herd into prominence because of the cow's ability to utilize large amounts of such feeds. It is not improbable that many farms, at least tenant farms, will consider the use of a strain, or breed, of cattle that will produce a reasonable amount of milk and an ac - ceptable beef carcass. On other farms, a cow herd for beef production only might be maintained. Where a small amount of capital is avail - able, cattle of the stocker and feeder class might be carried through certain seasons either upon a contract or outright purchase basis. In the case of the cow herd, maintained either for milk or beef production, or both, the plan would call for the utilization of as much </seg>

All or a part of the grain would be available to fatten the calves for market. On farms other than of the range type the animals fattened should be in market - able condition at the youngest possible age. If creep feeding were prac - ticed, the calf would be ready for market before or soon after his first birthday on the farm. Since he utilizes his grain more efficiently at this age than at any other time in his life, the expenditure for high priced feed would represent the minimum. The farm cow man cannot compete with the rangeman in the production of feeder cattle and therefore cannot produce yearling or two-year-old feeder steers. ' ■ J' . ' . ■ ■ .

Silage Increases Returns Per Acre The wintering of stock calves for sale to feeders during the spring months holds possibilities for a limited number of farmers. This plan involves obtaining good quality stock calves in the fall, wintering them upon roughages produced on the farm and marketing to feeders the following spring. It is doubtful if it pays to summer them on grass unless they are to be fattened on that farm. Several years' experiments at the University of Nebraska have shown that a calf will gain from 1.5 to 1.9 pounds per day upon silage and 2% pounds daily of alfalfa hay or 1 pound daily of a good protein concentrate. A calf will eat from 30 to 35 pounds of silage daily. Feedfer calves costing 8 cents could be sold for 8 cents the following spring and return from 6 to 7 dollars per ton for the silage consumed, after paying for the supplement. One acre of corn making 6 tons of silage will feed three steers approximately 5 months. At the above figure a gross return of from 36 to 42 dollars per acre would be realized or </seg>
            <seg id="p249">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION the equivalent of 72 to 84 bushels of 50-cent corn. The reader of this article will, in considering the livestock busi - ness, probably remember the drouth of 1934 and the many starving animals of that summer and winter. If so, he is probably happy that he had no livestock or at least but a few of them. Fortunately, 1934 drouths do not come often and perhaps when the next one comes, if it is not £00 far away, he will be prepared for it. Most of the livestock liquidation in 1934 could have been prevented had be planned a year or two ahead. Success in the stock business is dependent, to a con - siderable extent, upon careful planning. Too many of us feel that the hay and grain should be gone when grass comes. Feed was gone by grass time in 1934 but there was no grass — the result is well known. Silage as Feed Supply Insurance Professor H. J. Gramlich has often spoken about having a feed reserve on hand for such emergencies. A sounder policy for the live - stock man was never proposed. It is necessary to the livestock pro - ducer, and represents life insurance to his animals and financial insur - ance to himself. Many thousands of acres of corn and sorghum crops were left standing in the field last fall because no grain was produced. Recent experiments at the University show the feeding value of this stover fed as silage to be 75 per cent as valuable as 35-bushel corn for stock cattle. A few of the acres of weedy corn seen growing on both sides of the road last summer would also have made a silo full of feed which could have been used to advantage the past winter or it could be used any time when needed during the next 10 or 15 years. Feed shortages, both grain and roughages, are the worst enemy of the livestock industry and such shortages are not by any means confined to drouth years like 1934. Every year sees some part of the Corn Belt suffer from this enemy. Each time crops fail, hundreds of calves, lambs, and pigs go to market half-fat and bringing half prices. A grass program for the farm looking toward soil conservation and a stabilized agriculture cannot succeed in the absence of a livestock program. The latter cannot succeed unless plans are so laid that the business can continue from year to year. A feed reserve is the answer to this problem. When accomplished, good feeding methods, efficient production, and good livestock management will result. The farming business is then more likely to be a stable, profitable, and continuous enterprise. </seg>
            <seg id="p250">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE HOW CORX VARIETIES AND HYBRIDS YIELDED THE PAST SEASON T. A. KIESSELBACH There is a growing satisfaction in making these progress reports on hybrid corn. Each year's tests bring added confidence that we are on the right track in corn improvement. In fact, hybrid corn has passed the experimental stage and great enthusiasm prevails among corn growers for Its use in commercial corn production. One need but see a good hybrid growing in the field in comparison with standard open pollinated varieties to become thoroughly sold on its advantages. Superior yield, fewer barren plants, stronger and stiffer stalks, less down corn at husking, greater uniformity, and better grain quality are among its special attractions. All of these superior characters were in full evidence in 1935. General Plan of the Tests Corn growers have had fine opportunity this last year (1935) as in other recent years to observe their own varieties in comparison with the best commercial hybrids assembled from all parts of the corn belt, and with a number of promising experimental hybrids which have not yet been released for general production. Uniform yield tests, containing 34 hybrids and varieties, were conducted in five different localities of eastern Nebraska on the farms of cooperating farmers. Seed of the cooperator's own corn was also added to the collection. These tests were carefully planned and carried out in cooperation between the Agricultural Experiment Station, Agri - cultural Extension Service, the local county agricultural agent, and the farmer on whose land the crop was grown. Hundreds of farmers visited the test plats during the season. In order that all varieties and hybrids in the tests be given an equal opportunity, they were planted at a double rate per acre and thinned uniformly in the seedling stage to the desired stand. Each lot was planted in four different places- of each field and the results are based on the averages of all duplicate 3-row plats. Two of the replicate plats were cropped at the rate of 3 plants per hill and the other two at 2 plants per hill. The shelling percentages and moisture content were determined and yields were calculated for shelled corn containing 14 per cent moisture. In addition to these cooperative tests, corresponding plantings were made on the Experiment Station farm at Lincoln, together with about 200 additional experimental hybrids. The tests on the Station farm failed in 1935 because of severe drought as did all tests in 1934. </seg>
            <seg id="p251">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION Average Yields During 3 Years Before examining the results of all of the lots of corn tested in 1935, it would seem of special interest to observe the yields of five of the most important hybrids which have been tested for 3 years. The 3-year summary reported in Table 1 illustrates well the possibilities of hybrid corn in Eastern Nebraska. These five double crosses are all well recommended and have very good average performance records. They have all proved so productive and attractive that it has not yet seemed possible to definitely distinguish between them as to their relative merits. In this summary, Table 1", the hybrids may be com - pared with the extensively grown standard open-pollinated variety known as Krug. Krug has proved to be one of the most productive varieties over a period of years. As an average for the three-year period, 1932, 1933, and 1935, the yield of these five hybrids averaged 7.0 bushels per acre greater or 15% more than that of Krug. During the two years, 1933 and 1935, they surpassed the Krug 10.1 bushels per acre or 23 per cent. Three of these hybrids carrying Nebraska numbers are now being grown by Nebraska farmers as certified hybrids. Without doubt a 15 per cent increase is well worth while and an investment in hybrid seed at a reasonable price should prove profitable. While the amount of increase from any given hybrid varies in different Table 1. — Comparative yields of 5 recommended hybrids and Krug corn in Experiment Station and cooperative farm tests during 3 years 1932, 1933, and 1935.

            <seg id="p252">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE " at a price of $7.00 per bushel. Where ordinary corn yields 42 bushels per acre, approved hybrids should yield 49 bushels on the basis of a 16 per cent increase. Thus a dollar invested in such hybrid seed should bring in 7 bushels more corn. Through cooperative arrange - ments with the experiment stations of other states and the U. S. De - partment of Agriculture, the Nebraska Station has the seed stocks required to make any of these five hybrids. The Experiment Station hopes to be in a position to supply any seed stocks developed publicly in this country that are required in the production of desired certified hybrids. Yields in 1035 Now that we have discussed the performance of five outstanding hybrids that have been tested over a three-year period, it will be of interest to observe the yields of all lots that were grown in cooperative tests this past year. The air-dry yields of shelled corn per acre are given in Table 2 for each test and the average of all five tests. These tests were located on the farms of the following farmers who are inter - ested in the cause of corn improvement: (1) Honor Ochsner, Madison Co. (2) Amos Gramlich, Sarpy Co. (3) Ernest Peterson, Dixon Co. (4) John Moseman, Burt Co. (5) Arch Hosterman, Nemaha Co. In addition to the farmers' varieties and the Experiment Station hybrids from Iowa, Illinois, and Nebraska, commercial hybrids were included from Iowa and Illinois. It will be noted that as an average for the five tests, the nineteen highest yielding lots were hybrids. Although Iowa 13 ranked highest in yield it is not recommended because of somewhat inferior grain quality. Footnote to Table 2.

As seen in the summary at the bottom of the table, all hybrids out - yielded all the varieties by 6.1 bushels or 14%. The five best hybrids averaged 9.0 bushels or 21% more than the five highest yielding vSrlGtlGS. ! With respect to the open-pollinated varieties, attention may especi - ally be called to the low yield of Cattle corn. This variety was distinctly the lowest yielder of the five cooperative tests as it has been in other tests during the last half dozen years. The conclusion has been reached that although there is a considerable acreage of this variety grown in Nebraska, normally it yields considerably less than well selected types of Reid and Krug. It is suggested that growers of Cattle corn might well try some Reid. Krug. or hybrid seed in comparison with the Cattle corn It is not known why this variety should consistently yield less than others, but it is possible that this has resulted from a very narrow line of selection (approaching inbreeding) in an effort to fix ear and kernel characteristics. Adaptation of Hybrids ». Suitable hybrids are now definitely available for the eastern third of Nebraska and the irrigated land of Central Nebraska. Hybrids adapted to the dry lands of central and western Nebraska have not yet been established and efforts to develop suitable hybrids for such territory are still in the experimental stage. In the meantime it is suggested that standard local varieties of recognized adaptation be grown in those parts of the state. The hybrids now recommended for eastern Nebraska appear to have a rather wide adaptation and are being grown with satisfaction from as far north as Dakota county to Johnson county in the south An effort is being made to establish a somewhat larger and later ripen - ing hybrid for the extreme southeast, and perhaps a slightly earlier one for the extreme north. If the Nebr. 463 does as well in 1936 as </seg>
            <seg id="p255">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS 1 ASSOCIATION it did in 1935 (Table 2), this hybrid will be regarded as more nearly meeting the requirements for extreme 1 southeastern Nebraska as it is somewhat larger and later maturing. Under conditions of certified seed production where the seed stocks are of known origin and identity, one need not be concerned as to the source of seed being a factor in the adaptation of the hybrid. Any given hybrid will have identical inheritance whether the seed is produced on upland or bottom land, dry land or irrigation, or north, south, east, or west within the region of seed corn production. Naturally the seed quality may differ with the locality or conditions of produc - tion and a buyer will wish to give consideration to the questions of seed quality, such as maturity and viability. Because of the constancy of the heritable characteristics of hybrid corn, the question of change of adaptation does not arise as it does with open-pollinated varieties. In closing, two points should perhaps be stressed. All hybrids are not equally good, and one should depend upon local experience or dependable counsel in deciding what hybrid to plant. Second genera - tion seed of double-cross hybrids usually yields 15 to 20 per cent less than the first generation seed, and naturally should not be used as a substitute. To get maximum yields, therefore, plant only seed pro - duced directly in a natural-crossing field according to approved pro - cedure, and avoid picking seed from the resultant crop. PRODUCING H Yimi I) SEED CORN OX NEBRASKA FARMS By AMOS K. GRAMLICH, Ft. Crook, Nebraska Hybrid seed corn was first used on our farm in 1927 and has been used every year since, except one. The question of whether or not it is worth a considerable cash outlay each spring has long since been dispelled from my mind. When the Agricultural College first released parent seed in 1933 for the production of hybrid seed corn, enough was secured to plant a three-acre patch. Late planting and hot weather during July cut the yield and only twenty bushels of graded seed was produced. In the spring of 1934 a twenty-acre field was planted and after paying all the expense for seed, inspection fees for certification, and detasseling, a decent crop of fodder was not raised. In 1935 enough parent seed was finally obtained to plant an eighteen-acre field. Some of the seed was three years old and it seemed advisable to delay planting until May 20. Excessive rains delayed planting until June 6. Late plant - ing and hot weather at tasseling time cut the yield so much that only sixty bushels of graded seed was obtained from the eighteen-acre field. To date our experience with producing hybrid seed has not been </seg>
            <seg id="p256">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE very profitable. I do not mean to be discouraging to the beginners in hybrid seed corn production. It is not a get-rich-quick game, but does promise to pay well to the producer who will start in a small way and give it the careful attention it demands. Before attempting to raise hybrid seed the producer must take into consideration at least four things, namely, available parent seed stock, available isolated fields, available labor for detasseling, and available equipment for drying and grading the crop after it is grown. Seed Supply At the present time there is only one seed company in Nebraska attempting to develop its own hybrids. Most farmers, like myself, do not have the ability, training, or time to develop their own inbred lines and parent stock. They must depend almost entirely on seed distributed by the Agricultural Colleges. Selection of a Field After the seed supply has been alloted, a field of proper size should be selected. To be eligible for certification in 1935 fields had to be at least 25 rods from other corn, or if 10 male buffer rows are planted adjacent to other corn, the isolation distance could be reduced to 20 rods. The field should be of good fertility as the production cost per acre is very high. It is not necessary, but advisable, that the field had been planted to some crop other than corn the year before. This eliminates the danger of volunteer plants. A level field will greatly reduce the danger of losing seed because of heavy rains. Planting Usually the seed is planted, two rows of male and four rows of female. It is very necessary to keep an accurate chart of the field so there will be no confusion at detasseling time. Listing is a good way to plant as the seed is all put in clean ground and there is less danger of volunteer plants in the rows if corn was the previous crop. Listed corn usually does not grow as tall as checked corn which means that the tassels are easier to find and pull at detasseling time. If the planter is one with; easily removed boxes, it is advisable to have two sets of boxes rather than dumping the boxes each time parent seed is changed. In emptying the boxes great care must be used to remove all of the kernels, especially those that may work back under the retarding brushes. Dctassding Detasseling comes at a very busy period for the farmer-producer if he has small grain for harvest and alfalfa hay. When the first tassels appear it is the signal for daily rounds of the female rows pulling all </seg>
            <seg id="p257">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION tassels with as little Injury to the plants as possible. Daily detasseling may be necessary for 8 or 10 days after which it may be possible to work every other day until all tassels have appeared. This year, be - cause our corn did not come into tassel evenly, one man on a slow mule was able to handle 18 acres on all days except three when other help was provided. Using a slow horse has some advantages. The man is up out of the heat between the corn rows, and there he can easily see tassels as soon as the central stem breaks out of the curled leaves. This is an especial advantage on windy days when the leaves are in - clined to blow over and cover the tassel. In an ordinary year, one man could handle possibly 4 acres on all days except 3 or 4 when tassels are coming out at a rapid rate. A thorough job of detasseling is absolutely necessary. To be eligible for certification the field must be inspected twice without previous notice to the grower by a rep - resentative of the Nebraska Crop Growers' Association. If more than one per cent of the tassels are found shedding pollen at any time, the seed cannot be certified. Harvesting Care should be exercised in harvesting the crop to see that female ears are kept separate. A two-row mounted picker is ideal to use be - cause ears on the ground are not gathered. If dependable hired labor is used they should be paid by the day to relieve the desire to get a big load without regard for the proper ears. Storing, Processing and Selling The cost of production of hybrid seed is several times higher than ordinary field corn. To prevent freezing damage or loss of the crop, it should be immediately dried to 16% moisture in an ear corn drier, then shelled and dried to 12% or 13% in a shelled corn dryer. It will then stand any temperature below freezing. In some seasons the corn might be satisfactorily air dried but the danger of damage is too great to warrant the chance of losing so costly a product. Grading may be accomplished with any of the commercial ma - chines on the market but they are expensive to own. In most cases it will probably be more economical to have it done on a custom machine at some seed house. Most large hybrid producers treat their seed before sacking for shipment. In the light of experience this practice seems advisable for some states, although our own Experiment Station has not found it beneficial. The finished product should be sacked in one-bushel clean cotton bags and properly labeled and sealed. At the present time there is no problem connected with selling hybrid seed as the demand is far in excess of supply and the interest </seg>
            <seg id="p258">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE runs high. It is possible, however, if plenty of parent seed were available and too many producers entered the field, that expensive educational and advertising campaigns would have to be launched. In conclusion I would say to those who contemplate producing hybrid seed, first, be sure you want to enter the field and that you have the proper preliminary knowledge. Then enter in a small way and feel your way before expanding too rapidly. PRODUCING HYBRID SEED CORN ON OUR FARM By E. G. STECKLEY Mr. Chairman and members of the Crop Growers 1 Association: Mr. Stewart asked me to tell how I produced hybrid seed on my farm I think he should have asked me to tell the trials and trouble that I have had in producing hybrid seed. I have been producing hybrid seed for three years. The first year I had a yield of about 20 bushels of ungraded seed to the acre. Last year I put 50 acres into the silo and this year I produced about 35 bushels of ungraded seed to the acre. Producing hybrid seed on the farm can be divided into three parts. First, the procuring of the parent seed; second, the planting and de - tasseling; and third, the picking and caring for the seed after it is picked. I ; '■■ ■■ In most cases I have purchased my parent seed stocks from the University of Nebraska, but sometimes they do not have a large enougli supply to enable me to plant as much as I think I can handle. When I am unable to get enough from the University I try to find some pro - ducer of hybrid who has the parent I want and whose seed can be certified. This year it was impossible to find enough of the female parent for our hybrid #238, and that is the reason there is so little on sale for the coming season. The listing of parent seed is much more difficult than listing regularly graded corn, and almost always takes a special plate that you cannot buy, but by experimenting you make one that does fairly well. Parent seed seems to be made up of large round kernels or little kernels that go through the plate two at a time. I might say here that I farm entirely with a tractor and tractor machinery. I list two rows of the male and four rows of the female. I have two sets of boxes for my lister and have the number of the corn printed on the top of each box so that I won't mix the two. I carry all four boxes on the lister by having a small crate wired on the back of the lister. I make a full round with the female corn and then slip the male corn boxes on </seg>
            <seg id="p259">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION and make a half round. At each end of the male rows I drive little stakes so that I am always sure which are the male rows. After listing I am always glad to see the corn up, as usually I have used all of my seed and if I get a poor stand nothing can be done about it. This year we had an eight-inch rain on a small part of my field before it came up and there was very little corn produced on those acres. The cultivating of hybrid seed is just the same as with any other corn, except that at the end of each male row I get off the tractor and place the little stakes so they can be easily seen. In producing two different hybrids that have the same male I use different kinds of stakes for the male rows in each hybrid. DctiiKscling Must Be Thoroughly Done The next job is detasseling, a job that my wife always likes to see coming. For her, it is just the same as having threshers. For four - teen days Sundays and week days are the same. The tassels begin to show about the 12th of July. At that time one man walking fast can cover 1G acres in one day. The tassels come out very fast and in a few days I find I must have a man to every three acres of female corn. This will continue for about 10 or 11 days and then taper off just as it began. Every tassel must be pulled out on the female rows before it sheds any pollen. It is much easier to cut them but it is impossible to get all of the tassel that way, and the little that is left will do as much damage as a whole tassel. After the tassels are almost gone I send the men through with corn knives and cut all suckers on the female rows that have not yet tasseled out. The male parent of #238 tassels about four or five days after the female and I am anxious for good weather so the pollen will fertilize the ears of the detasseled corn. Hybrid seed usually matures a little earlier than other kinds of corn and can be picked sooner. But this year it was late. I always use a two-row corn picker to pick my hybrid seed. By using this machine I do not get any ears that might be on the ground and could have come from the male rows. I put all the hybrid seed in a crib by itself away from any other corn. This year due to the moist air and very poor drying conditions, it was necessary to make a dryer in another crib and move the hybrid seed there. It is drying very well and I am now picking it over and shelling it by hand. There are a great many ears this year with bad parts on them. All of this is being pinked out by hand. It is quite a job and takes a lot of experienced help. I am reducing the moisture to about 15% and then it will be graded, sacked and ready to ship. There is one thing about producing hybrid seed on the farm, and that Is from the time you list the corn in May until May of the next year, you always have some kind of a job with this seed. </seg>
            <seg id="p260">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE PLANS, POLICIES AND FOUNDATION SEED DISTRIBUTION FOR HYBRID SEED CORN PRODUCTION ON NEBRASKA FARMS IN 1036 By P. H. STEWART Dr. Kiesselbach has reported to you the results of the 1935 corn variety and hybrid tests and has discussed the general characteristics of hybrid corn in comparison with open pollinated varieties. After more than twenty years of experimental work, it can now be said with - out contradiction that we have hybrids that will outyield our best pollinated varieties approximately ten to twenty per cent. In addition to the production of higher yields, these hybrids are very desirable from the standpoint of stiffness of stalk, freedom from suckers and dis - eases, and general quality of grain produced. The fact that farmers have come to appreciate the superiority of the better hybrids is re - flected in the greatly increased demand for hybrid seed this fall and the general interest evidenced in foundation seed stock for the produc - tion of hybrid seed. While better hybrids no doubt will be available In the future, we are agreed, that at the present time we have hybrids producing higher yields and sufficiently attractive in other respects to justify their use instead of open pollinated corn. The release and distribution of corn hybrids presupposes that an adequate testing and culling program has been carried on to de - termine the best hybrids and their adaptation to various parts of the state. In Nebraska, we attempt to secure this information by means of adequate tests at Experiment Stations and carefully hand-planted and thinned plantings in replicated plats on farms in various parts of the state. Shall such tests be restricted to the hybrid productions of state institutions, or shall commercial hybrids being offered for sale also be included? If commercial hybrids are included, shall we require that the firm file a report showing the lines involved? Unless this is done and this particular hybrid should prove to be superior, can one justifi - ably recommend it, not knowing from season to season what it con - tains or whether it contains the same lines each year as grown in the yield tests from which recommendations are made? Although in the past these commercial lots have been included in the Nebraska tests, we have the feeling that we shall not hereafter include them in outstate cooperative tests unless we have a signed report (which would be held confidential if desired) as, to the inbreds and com - binations involved. Hybrids which, during two or more years of testing, show the most desirable characteristics and which produce the best yields of high quality grain are considered for increase and distribution. </seg>
            <seg id="p261">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS 1 ASSOCIATION J Will Farmers Use Hybrids The widespread use of hybrid seed by Nebraska farmers will depend largely upon the following conditions: (1) It must consistently yield at least 10 per cent better than open pollinated varieties; (2) it must be available at reasonable prices; and (3) it must truly be a hybrid and as represented with reference to breeding, otherwise fraud and misrepresentation will cause its ruination. I The price of good hybrid seed depends on a number of factors such as the amount of seed available, its superiority over ordinary varieties, and the general care which growers have given to the production of well-detasseled and carefully isolated fields. It is hard to state definitely what a reasonable price would be but it seems likely, as more seed becomes available, that the price for reliable hybrid seed will be reduced considerably from the present price scale. The amount of hybrid seed which we can produce depends largely upon the amount of foundation seed available for the production of commercial hybrid corn. We have found in Nebraska during the last three years that the building of adequate and dependable seed supplies is one of the most troublesome and important problems connected with commercializing hybrid corn. Inbrcds For Increase For instance, how shall the inbreds be handled? Shall the Experi - ment Station retain full control of all inbred seed stocks or shall they be distributed generally to growers who may increase them from year to year, complying, of course, with certain regulations in case of certification. Our contact with Nebraska hybrid corn growers in - dicates that they prefer not to concern themselves with the increase and production of inbred seed stocks, but choose to purchase either inbred or single-cross seed for commercial hybrid seed production. It is the present plan of the Nebraska Agricultural College to re - tain the ownership of all inbred seed stocks originating at this institu - tion. These inbred seed stocks will be sold to growers who wish to produce F, single cross seed, but the inbred seed crop is to remain in the custody of the Nebraska College of Agriculture. It is proposed that in order to be certified, all inbred seed stocks must be distributed through the Nebraska College of Agriculture, rather than by growers. Such a plan of distribution would permit growers to produce F, single cross seed and it would also permit them to grow all of the in - bred seed they want for their own use, but it would avoid having inbred seed stocks handled from grower to grower in general seed traffic throughout the state. In cases where commercial seed firms develop their own inbred </seg>
            <seg id="p262">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGKiCULTURK " \ seed stocks, then these would be eligible for certification so long as they were used on the farm of the originator, but traffic in inbreds would not be permitted for the production of seed under certification. It would seem to be the function of the College of Agriculture to develop, sufficient seed stocks for hybrid corn increase, but the Institu - tion should not develop the growing of seed stocks to the point where It is entering into competition with farmers and others in the seed business. By retaining ownership and the distribution of inbreds, the College of Agriculture could control the purity of seed stocks, but the work of preducing F, single-cross and advanced generation single-cross, as well as the commercial hybrid seed would be left largely in the hands of farmers and growers. I ■ ■ - Just what prices would be charged for inbred lines and paid to the grower for the inbred seed that he might produce would of coarse vary with the development of hybrid corn and the amount of seed stocks available. Probably prices for such seed stocks will have to be set from year to year for each inbred and single-cross as circum - stances may require. Certification Necessary Protection Restrictions as to traffic in inbreds and the other regulations per - taining to the production of hybrid corn, to the uninitiated, may seem somewhat unnecessary, over-strict and arbitrary. However, we feel that the successful development and widespread use of hybrid corn depends on a thorough system of seed certification and record keep - ing. Because of its very nature and composition, hybrid corn must have the assistance and protection of inspection and certification work to avoid the pitfalls of misrepresentation. We believe that rules governing the certification of single-cross seed stocks should be even more strict as to isolation and detasseling than those regarding com - mercial hybrid seed. Whet constitutes good isolation for natural crossing plats? In the more level, windy prairie states devoid, for the most part, of timber, do we need greater isolation? The appear - ance of some white kernels in certain lots of yellow hybrid seed leads us to believe that we need more data on this point. Price of Foundation Seed Stocks The question may be asked as to what price should be asked for inbred single-cross or double-cross seed. It is our feeling that the cost of foundation seed should be high enough to pay the production and handling costs of seed produced under the most carefully con - trolled conditions. The additional cost of a few cents per pound on foundation seed is of little importance to the hybrid seed producer. He is more concerned with good quality, purity and dependability, </seg>
            <seg id="p263">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION together with sufficient amounts of seed to meet all of his possible needs. High prices for inbred and single-cross seed, provided they are not actually prohibitive and excessive beyond reason, will attract producers and assure a supply of seed to growers who want foundation seed but cannot now find a sufficient supply. j us t what there prices should be, may no doubt vary with local and state conditions from year to year. I have already mentioned the importance of a strict certification system in the development of a hybrid corn program. At this time the word hybrid" is being used rather loosely and in some cases inten - tionally so in the sale of corn. We know of certain instances in the state where variety crosses are being sold as "hi-bred" corn or as so - called Mule corn. Such variety crosses are not true hybrid seed and should not be confused with hybrids. A state law defining and pro - tecting the term "hybrid corn" would be desirable. The state of Iowa has a law which seems to fit the situation very well. It is brief to the point, and reads as follows: "Be It Enacted by the General Ass.mbly of the State of Iowa-" Sect.on I. It shall be unlawful for any person, firm, corporation or its asents or representatives to sell, offer or expose for sale, or falsely mark or tag, within the state of Iowa, any seed corn as hybrid unless it represents the first generation of a cross between strains of different parentage and involving inbred lines of corn and/or their combinations." "Section 2 The cross mentioned above shall be produced by cross fertiliza - tion controlled either by hand or by detasseling at the proper time." •Section 3. Every violation of the provisions of this act shall be deemed Mm T^ P unlrt "tole &gt;'&gt;• * fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100) or imprisonment for thirty (30) days in the county jail or both. The department of agriculture through its duly authorized agent or agents may institute proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction to enforce this act." South Dakota also has a law much like the Iowa law, defining and protecting the term "hybrid corn". A number of states, such as Illinois, Ohio and Wisconsin, have regulations passed by the State Department of Agriculture restricting the use of the term "hybrid" and authorizing its use when it applies to specific situations. Up to this time it has been impossible to produce sufficient seed stocks to supply all of those wishing to produce commercial hybrid corn. The 1934 drouth ruined the prospects of building these up to a considerable amount. The 1935 season was none too favorable and consequently at this time the amount of inbred and single-cross seed is very small in the light of demands for this. The following amounts are available at this time and at the prices indicated. We will take applications from growers who wish some of this seed and when such applications are on file, they will be gone over by a committee from the Department of Agronomy and allotments made to the applicants. Unfortunately, there is so little seed that </seg>
            <seg id="p264">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE undoubtedly many growers will be disappointed, but the seed will be distributed as impartially as possible, with the hope that in 1937 or at least by 1938 ample supplies will be available.

The annual meeting in the Plant Industry building was called to order by Mr. Bert Mott in the absence of President Thompson. The minutes of the 1935 meeting were read and approved. The report of the treasurer, P. H. Stewart, for 1935 was read and approved. Moved by Dr. T. A. Kiesselbach that a committee be appointed by the President to promote proper legislation for the protection of hybrid corn. Motion carried. Mr. Bert Mott, chairman of the resolutions committee, composed of Anton Frolik and C. G. L. Schlechte, read the following resolution: "Whereas, a survey of the Nebraska 1935 corn crop indicates that there will be a serious seed shortage in many Nebraska counties. This varies apparently from complete failure in certain counties to as high as 50% satisfactory for seed in other areas. Reports indicate that in some counties there is still In storage a considerable amount of 1932-33 corn, much of which should make satisfactory seed. In cer - tain counties there appears to be sufficient old corn on hand to plant as much as 50% of the normal county corn acreage. Therefore, be it resolved that the Nebraska Crop Growers' Asso - ciation request the College of Agriculture to give wide publicity to the seed corn situation, to the end that Nebraska farmers may be warned of the situation, advised as to proper testing practices and assisted in securing supplies of adapted seed. • Motion carried. The following resolution was also read by Mr. Mott: "Whereas, the great and supreme Ruler of the universe has in His infinite wisdom removed from among us one of our worthy and esteemed fellow-laborers, August H. Biermann and, whereas, the long and Intimate relation held with him in the faithful discharge of his duties in the Nebraska Crop Growers' Association makes it eminently be - fitting that we record our appreciation of him; therefore, Resolved, that the wisdom and ability which he has exercised in the aid of our organization by service and counsel, will be held in grateful remembrance; Resolved, that the sudden removal of such a life from among our </seg>

MEETING Held in the Dairy Building College of Agriculture University of Nebraska Lincoln, Nebraska WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 8, 1936 PRESIDENT H. F. BRANDT, Beatrice SECRETARY L. K. CROWE, Lincoln MR. H. P. BRANDT: Folks, I am sorry to have kept you waiting, but the roads were quite' slippery this morning, and I drove very care - fully. We will now go ahead with the meeting and the first thing on the program will be a talk by Dr. L. VanEs, of the Animal Pathology Department, who is known here and also internationally. Dr. -VanEs. DR. L. VAN ES: Mr. Chairman and Friends. I notice by the announcement on the program that I have to speak about a new menace in the dairy industry in the shape of mastitis. I do not agree with that statement because the mastitis problem is not a new one. I would like to say also as an introduction to my subject, that if mastitis is a manace, the breeding of better dairy cows must be a menace, because it is the direct result of improved breeding of dairy cows as far as production is concerned. Nature introduced the female of the bovine animals for her pur - pose. In the early days the development of the udder was just enough to feed the calf for the necessary period of time. By selective breed - ing we began to improve these animals' skeletal frame and produced an animal of large body and large udder, and the udder has become so large that it is exposed to injuries and other calamities, while it produces these larger quantities of milk which place it under a very severe strain. It stands to reason that the present organ that is producing to its total capacity is under a more severe strain than in the old days when the cow had a small udder well proportioned to her body and the secretion was not so high as now. So, I don't want to speak of it as a menace, but I want to speak of it as a thing you </seg>
            <seg id="p289">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION dairymen will have to face. I want to help you cope with it and to keep it at a minimum. In the first place, I believe, we should define what we mean by mastitis. Mastitis simply means "an inflamatory disease of the udder". Mastitis, or inflamation, may be caused by a good many different causes. Some of these causes we need not discuss because the mastitis we are considering is a more or less specific disease so we will leave the others without mentioning them at the present time. There are several changes in Mastitis that show considerable variation. In the first place, you may notice that the milk secretion is not normal. You may not be able to recognize this at first, but a more scrupulous examination will show that there are foreign elements in the milk. It will be flaky or lumpy. Oftentimes this will appear in the form of slugs. That is, I believe, the first thing you will notice when the cow's udder becomes diseased. In the most accute cases you may notice that a cow milking a certain quantity will fall behind, and you may notice that there is something wrong with the milk. In some cases there will be a yellowish liquid showing that the udder has been damaged and you will recognize that this is not milk. Then you may notice a change in the udder. The cow will refuse to eat and will run a high temperature and these will, consequently, be shown in the average case of mastitis or the cow who produces flaky milk or milk with slugs. Then you may notice it when you feel the udder with your hands. The teats are filling with scar tissue and a pus-like matter will come out. When you let the milk stand in a bottle it will form a sediment in the bottom of the bottle that is readily perceptible. That is always a phenomenon that you should consider seriously. Then you find another thing that goes along with this is that the udder does not hold its form, while the udder in its normal state has the same form, definite slope from front to back, but at a time like this the udder tissue is probably being eliminated as far as production is concerned. There are many causes for mastitis. It may be caused by specific organisms and one of those organisms is known as streptococci. Streptococci can be readily found in most accute cases, but it is always present, though at times, perhaps for a week or two, it cannot be found. There are many species of streptococci and some of those which do not cause mastitis may also be present. It is well to rec - ognize either of these even though they may not be the mastitis organisms. - I forgot to mention another change in the milk. There is a chemical change in the milk particularly in regard to the increased alkali con - tent. This is revealed by the brom-thymol test and by the increase in chlorine as indicated by titration with silver nitrate. The Swiss dairy- </seg>
            <seg id="p290">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE men usually determine this by tasting the milk. I wouldn't want to advocate this practice though, because some of these organisms produce septic sore throat in humans. It is generally true that mastitis is more or less generally distri - buted in many herds that are still producing well. In going to buy dairy cows, more or less sight unseen — you are running the risk of setting your herd afire with mastitis, because that disease is more or less generally distributed at this time. How does this come about, say in a herd that is sound and all at once mastitis appears in it? How does it come there, you ask. Generally by the introduction of an infected cow. The infected cow is the introducer of the disease into the herd and stable and from there on it will be distributed. The disease is such an infectious one and can be easily carried by the hands of the milker or the milking machine. After an infected cow is in - troduced, the chances for infection among the other animals are very good. It is true that in a good majority of the cases the disease finds its way into the udder from the teat. It may be that the cow picks up this infection in some feed and it is transmitted through the blood stream. These cases, however, are rare. There are many times when the milker will not milk dry and- sometimes a small amount is left, and I think in a good many cases a certain amount of milk remains. Furthermore, the milker will leave the teat wet. Milk is a fine culture medium for streptococci. That is another reason why you should never milk on the floor. The cow lies down on this wet floor and the teat comes in contact with the floor, and the streptococci may be present there. Taken this way with a suitable body temperature, these organ - isms multiply rapidly. They are like small marbles, then these spread into a string of marbles. Sometimes the strings are short and some - times they are long. This infection may take place and you may not notice it for three or four months. The very cow stable will be. in - volved and favor the spread of infection. Stable hygiene plays a big part, but I need not tell you that, as practical dairymen. Another thing in connection with the stable that must always be considered is that a cow that lies down on a filthy floor comes in contact with deadly diseases. The floor should always hold good clean bedding so that the cow can in no way become injured. It has been observed many times that most diseases occur in filthy and less sanitary stables and that is why we say the mastitis problem is most severe in the larger herds. Although small herds are not exempt, the greatest mastitis problems come in the larger herds. In the large herds the milking machines figure as a means of spreading mastitis and is least noticed because the milker comes in less contact with the udder than if he were milking by hand. When </seg>
            <seg id="p291">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION milking by hand it is easier to detect a change in the udder. After an infected cow has been milked by the milking machine, mastitis will spread more rapidly in the herd milked by that machine than others milked by hand. I do not say, however, that the milking machine can not be operated in such a way as to make it harmless, but in many places more has to be done than is done now. Less than a year ago I had the opportunity to see a milking ma - chine (Roto-lactor) in operation back in New Jersey. I thought I was in dreamland when I saw this outfit. There are two hundred fifty cows and the cows and machines are examined every day. At a given time a cow goes onto the milking machine and at a given time taken off. All the apparatus is then dipped into hot water and sterilized, then taken out of the hot water and put into a cold water bath so as not to scald the cow's teats. You have to see such a thins to ap - preciate it. Another thing that I want to bring to your attention is that when you are unfortunate enough to have an infected cow in your herd, that infected cow should be forever barred from the use of a milking ma - chine. That cow should always be milked by hand. Kven then the milker who milks the cow may transmit the disease by his hands. I remember one time when I was milking cows I went from one cow to another without washing my hands and some did well if they washed their hands before breakfast. That was all perfectly legitimate in those days. However, it does not go with the high class stock which we now have. Our best dairy cows come from that fine breeding that is being done today, and we want to protect them. Supple hands and good judgment are required of a good milker. Another thing that depends upon the milker is that he milks completely. That is one means of preventing mastitis. The udder should be cleaned before the milking is begun and cleaned after the milking is finished. Another thing to beware of is milking on the floor. That is about the worst bad habit I know. I know of an incident where only three teats on th« cow were good and the milker milked the fourth on the floor. If the bad teat should be milked, and it should in most cases, the milk should be received in a separate vessel and should never be milked on the floor. In the case of infected cows in the herd, the good ones should be milked first and the infected ones last. There is another thing that some of you may have observed, and that is the kind of help you may have — the kind that milk only in - cidentally. You have a very good dairy cow, but the milker complains that this cow is a very hard milker. This type of person is bad to a good cow. You want to watch the proceedings of that milker be - cause the chances are he will not milk very completely. He gets fati - gued and does not get on. Then watch him in some other things. </seg>
            <seg id="p292">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Even I, in my innocent days have been guilty of trying to save a little labor by taking a wire nail and dilating the opening of the teat. Some of the fellows used to use straws and in so doing have pretty nearly ruined some good milk cows. The use of any teat dilator is as danger - ous as a loaded pistol in the hands of a monkey. More cows have been ruined by the use of teat tubes. In my experience as a veterin - arian I have found that sometimes you have to use these tubes, but in that case the whole procedure should be put into competent hands, and always beware of the teat dilator and milk tubes unless in the proper hands. When using these, rub on alcohol and then wash the milk tubes and boil them for fifteen minutes and be sure to have your hands clean. I know all this sounds fussy and maybe you think it is too fussy for practical use. A certain amount of surgery must be brought into the stable, and in the majority of cases of these tough milkers a surgeon can take a small knife and go up through the teat canal and by the use of this small screw-like knife cut the opening larger. One precaution you must remember and that is to make the incision come to the point of the teat, otherwise the milk will go every - where except in the pail. Always remember that when the milking is done, you should wash the cow's udder and dry it because it must not be left wet. Each cow should have its own cloth and the cloths should be sterilized and kept in clean places. I know that sounds fussy, probably too fussy for many of you, but that is an idea that 1 am trying to bring before you — be clean and be careful. There is another thing I want to bring before you and that is the replacing of your stock. Observe the owner of a fairly good sized dairy herd. He desires to buy some new stock or replace some in his herd. He visits auctions and sale barns and other places to get those cows. The introduction of a cow into your herd without know - ing anything about her, is a mighty dangerous thing to do, in these days. It is as dangerous in this day and age as it was back fifteen or twenty years ago when you couldn't buy ten cows such as you would desire in your herd without getting tuberculosis. The better plan is to buy young heifers, preferably unbred, and let them grow up under your own care and management where you know what they are. It is difficult even by a scrupulous examination to detect the infected cow. I appeal to your breeding sense to detect these things and do the best you can. Mastitis more generally affects the back quarters more than the fore quarters and generally follows an excessive rainy season. It is also more common among the older animals rather than the young stock, though some mastitis has been found in heifers. Always see that you retain your desirable females and let them grow up, then you have a chance to start off with a clean slate, and there is little danger in connection with young animals. Retain your young animals and as much as possible make your replacements from them, thereby safeguarding your own herd. </seg>

Sometimes you skip a milking or maybe two, and you may have an acute flare-up on your hands. You want always to practice sanitation but practice it economi - cally. It does no good to practice it to the extent that you run vourself in the poor house, then your economy does no one anv good. Don't forget the stable hygiene. That part is vitally essential. Make it a S5S Wa n h y0UF handS " etWeen eaCh mllking 3nd be S " re to sterilize the milking machine. Watch for flakiness in the milk, also for pus m the bottom of the vessel. Watch the cows and have them tested. You may find you have an undesirable cow on your hands. Watch that cleanliness after milking. You remember they used to cure everything with a salve that you rubbed on— much of it was very stinking stuff too. That has been done away. There is no cure for mastitis, but cleanliness will help to check it though complete recovery chances are very doubtful. Disinfect the udder and keep it clean Sometimes this inflammation is not generally distributed through the udder but is more or less localized. Then is the time to act If you see a little fiakiness in the milk, do you do something about it? Don't endanger the remainder of your herd. Strip that cow and rub her udder, then strip her again. Be sure you leave nothing there for more infection to form. Take these facts and watch your cows. I wduld be glad now to answer any questions that you may have in mind at this time. MR. BRANDT: We thank you, Dr. VanEs, for this fine talk and now Mr. Crowe has an announcement for us. MR. L. K.

BRANDT: We will go right on with the program and next •will be a talk by Dr. Downs, of the Dairy Husbandry Department. I think he needs no introduction to you people. Dr. Downs. DR. P. A. DOWNS: In this study no attempt was made to study the whole milking but rather the complete secretion of the individual quarters of the udder. This was accomplished by the use of both milking machine equipment as well as a four-compartment pail so that the milk from each quarter could be kept separate without alter - ing the regular milking process. The preliminary study of 36 different animals in this manner indicates that there is great variation in the amount of milk produced by the different quarters of the udder at a given milking. The tabulation of results obtained from cows that have had no garget history indicates that the hind quarters consistently gave more milk than the fore quarters at the same milking. Fresh cows ap - parently showed greater variation than did cows further along in lactation. When the production of the hind quarters was taken as 100 per cent, it was found that the average of eight animals in normal lactation was 57.2 per cent for the right front and 5G.2 per cent for the left front quarters. The study of 26 animals, which have had garget history, showed great variation in production. Percentage production of front and roar quarters showed reduction as great as 90 per cent when compared with production of the corresponding quarter at the same milking. The amount of reduction apparently depending upon the extent of the disease and condition of the udder. While the fat content of the milk varied greatly from quarter to quarter, no definite trends could be observed. Studies of the production of a cow being milked three times a day were made for 30 consecutive days. One quarter showing an active case of mastitis (garget) showed marked reduction in flow and in general a lower percentage of fat in the milk produced. The produc - tion of the quarters showed marked variation in production from milking to milking. Extreme variations of 5.5 pounds to 1.5 pounds at the following milking and 6.7 to 2 pounds were noted. The vari - ation seemed to be consistent in all quarters for that particular milk - ing. The percentage of fat varied greatly, showing a trend toward the highest percentage of fat in the largest amount of milk usually following a milking of low production with low percentage of fat. The quality of milk as shown by appearance, pH ( Brom Thymol Blue Test), leucocyte count on original milk, and presence of strepto- </seg>
            <seg id="p295">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION cocci in incubated samples, showed great irregularities during the 3 0-day period. The quarter having active mastitis showed definite changes in pH varying from 7.2 to 5.5 which seemed to occur in waves from one extreme to the other while in the most active stages, and then remaining between 6.5 and 7.2 while in the less active stage. In the other quarters a variation of pH from 6.5 to 6.7 was noted but was not consistent from milking to milking. The active quarter showed high leucocyte count and streptococci in the original milk. The number of streptococci present during the most active stage in - creased and decreased in number periodically as did the leucocyte count. In the less active stage the streptococci count was less than 10,000 per c.c. but they were found periodically in the incubated samples. In the quarters that were infected but showed no signs of garget, there was no consistent result either of leucocyte count or streptococci count in the incubated samples. Neither the Brom Thymol Blue Test nor the streptococci count in incubated samples showed the presence of the infection at all milkings. MR. BRANDT: The next thing on the program is a talk by Mr. Davis of the Dairy Department and I am sure he is another who needs no introduction to this group. He will talk on "Progress in Dairy Experiments". Mr. Davis. MR. DAVIS: Experiments are designed to solve problems and problems may be defined as "felt difficulties." There are to be sure, a vast number of problems to be solved and only a few can be under - taken. In discussing the experimental work in progress at the Dairy Husbandry Department of the University of Nebraska, I will mention briefly the reasons why the particular experiment or experiments were undertaken. Observation, discussion with other breeds, and a quarter of a century of experience has convinced me that one of the most serious problems facing the dairyman and the dairy cattle breeder is main - taining regular reproduction in a dairy herd. Cows must be bred and must calve with some regularity or the profits from the dairy are re - duced. Members of Dairy Herd Improvement Associations can bear testimony that it is extremely difficult to keep the herd breeding regularly year after year. The usual trouble as it is casually analyzed is that the cow does not conceive; she conceives and either absorbs the foetus or aborts; or the bull is not potent. To find out about bulls, the data for more than 30 years has been carefully tabulated to determine if possible, if there was any effect of age upon sureness of conception. The bulls were classified as to their years of age and the females were classified as to their age as well as season of the year, so that now </seg>
            <seg id="p296">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE there will shortly be available a vast amount of data as to the effect of age of animals upon conception. Already studies have been made of contagious abortion and the losses that Bang's disease causes. The problem is how to get the cows to conceive regularly. One of our studies is of the potency of dairy bulls. The potency is determined by examining the semen under a microscope and determining by examina - tion the number and activity of the spermatazoa according to an arbitr - ary scale. This involved establishing some new techniques for ob - taining samples. Such examinations revealed to us that certain bulls were not potent although quite active in every way. That necessarily made it advisable to develop means of bringing back potency to the bulls, but how? Exercise has been recommended and doubtless is effective, but how effective is not known. Exercising bulls, necessarily involves either rather expensive equipment, or a considerable amount of labor, or both. A bull exerciser is a costly piece of apparatus, and labor to lead a bull is frequently not available. The restoration of potency was, therefore, approached through the use of hormones. Hormones may be crudely described as chemical substances that stimulate body reactions. Searches have shown that in the urine of pregnant females of some species of mammals, is a sex stimulating hormone called prolan. In our laborities extractions were made and prolan in a reasonably pure form prepared. This is injected into the gluteal muscle of the bull in a series of injections lasting over a week. The results so far have indicated that prolan does restore bulls to potency, and one old bull has been restored twice. Not all heifers conceive at the first or even the second service. In fact there is very good evidence to the effect that an appreciable percentage of heifers are very difficult to get with calf. Examinations as to disease condi - tions and manual examination of the ovaries per anus indicated that many heifers are apparently normal yet they. do not readily conceive. Why? To test the effect of prolan and of wheat germ oil (a very potent source of vitamin E) as compared with no treatment, three lots of heifers have been selected. ■ In each of the lots are balanced heifers (usually half sisters of about the same age) so that comparable results as to the effect of the treatment may be obtained. Within the breed, the same bull will be bred to the balanced heifers in the three lots. It is hoped that some additional light may be shed upon the breeding problem by these experiments. Calf raising has always been a problem. As dairying has developed into an industry, efforts have been directed toward raising calves with less and less milk and under more artificial conditions. The results have been that calves have often made fair to good gains in weight, but became quite susceptible £o various ailments, such as pneumonia,' in - digestion, scours, etc. A casual survey of the calves raised by dairy - men will indicate that many lack thrift, are "puny" and "runty". A </seg>
            <seg id="p297">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION study ol the food supplied to these calves indicates that it was ade - quate in so far as protein and total nutrients are concerned. What then was lacking? That is what we are trying to find out. Two balanced lots of calves were selected and started at birth. One group received whole milk plus cod liver oil and grain and hay, while the other group received skim milk plus vitamin A and D concentrates, (a commercial preparation which contains very definite quantities of these vitamins) and grain and hay. Two young bull calves were fed only skim milk plus grain and hay. The weights and the measure - ments of these calves have been taken at definite intervals. It is hoped that this may throw some light on the subject of calf raising and may indicate whether calves can be raised successfully without whole milk. In recent years there has been aroused a great deal of interest in soft curd milk. Soft curd milk may be defined as milk, the curd of which when it coagulates forms a soft, easily broken curd, as com - pared with milk that forms a rather 1 stiff, hard curd. Studies in the medical field have indicated that soft curd milk is much more easily digested by invalids and especially by babies that may have any digestive troubles. Soft curd milk does, therefore, have a commercial significance. In our work, the effort has been made to study the effect of different milkings, different cows, different breeds and seasons of the year upon the curd character. It is hoped that knowledge may be gained in that way as to what affects the curd character. With a larger understanding and appreciation of the role that the vitamins play in human nutrition, it becomes possible to deduce that these food accessory factors may be of much more importance in animal nutrition. It is generally believed that dairy cattle receiving a normal diet have an abundance of these factors in their food supply. With the constant efforts of man to develop a higher producing animal and the tendency to herd animals together and feed them more con - centrated feed, there has developed such troubles as irregularity of breeding, uneven milk production, irregular percentage of butterfat, etc. To illustrate, a cow makes a good record, is dried off, and when she freshens again shows little evidence as regards swelling of the udder. In fact, after she calves, the cow produces little or no milk. There are no pathological symptoms, and no mastitis. What is the matter? It is evident that there has been a disturbance of the physi - ological function but what is the disturbance due to is not known. Many farmers noted that during the last drouth and for months there - after, the percentage of butterfat was greatly reduced. This occurred in the University herd which was fed the same feeds (doubtless the quality was different) before and after the drouth. Thinking that this might be due to the lack of vitamin A, studies are being con- </seg>
            <seg id="p298">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ducted as to the vitamin A content of various kinds of silage, or rather, various methods of putting up corn fodder for silage. This year the vitamin A content of ordinary corn silage; corn fodder to which molasses had been added as it was put into the silo, called molasses silage; and corn fodder to which mineral acids were added at the time of siloing, called A.I.V. silage, were studied. This is one step to determine the vitamin A content of the entire ration. Herd records of all kinds are valuable sources of information. Studies have been made of the gain in weight during pregnancy for the Ayrshire, Guernsey, Jersey and Holstein breeds as affected by the period of gestation. This may seem to be a lot of useless information, but it will likely prove useful for two purposes. First, it will establish a standard rate of gain, will show the losses that occur at parturition, and will make possible more accurate experimental control when pregnant animals are used. Second, it helps establish when and how much gain occurs during pregnancy as separated from growth. Studies are being carried on to determine what influence age, growth, number of milkings, and pregnancy have upon the milk pro - duction, and the rate of decline of milk production. It is a well known fact that milk production increases after calving and finally reaches a high point after which it gradually declines. Some people have be - lieved that for a normal cow, there •would be a very regular curve, de - pending upon various conditions such as those mentioned. The fact of the matter is that one organization has stated that knowing the date of calving, the high point of milk production, and the date that a cow was served, that one day's production of milk would allow for fairly accurate estimate, by means of calculation, of the entire produc - tion for the lactation period. This theory may be sound or it may not. At least, we hope to find out some facts about the matter. For many years in the attempt to improve the dairy herd, a plan for line breeding has been carried on. This plan for the Holstein breed is based upon the maintaining of several related families and line breed - ing, and interbreeding these families. From time to time, out-crosses have been introduced by bringing in bulls. These sires have in every instance been related at least distantly to our own animals. All of this has been carried on with the hope of eventually developing a pure line for high production as well as animals of acceptable type. In this work it has been possible to develop a five generation group of Holstein females that test approximately four per cent fat. Studies have been carried on as to the nature of mastitis, what it does to the udder, how it affects milk and fat production, and possible methods of prevention or control. The dairy herd, in so far as milking cows are concerned is divided into a herd that is free from the disease, </seg>
            <seg id="p299">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION a herd that is but mildly affected, and a badly Infected herd. Each herd is kept separate and the possibilities of eliminating mastitis by segregation are being tried. Growth studies of a fundamental nature have been in progress for about 14 years. In these studies each calf dropped on the farm is weighed at birth and within a few days after birth is photographed on both sides, and a series of measurements taken. These are continued each month along with weights and photographs, so that the complete history of the animal as told by weights, measurements, and photo - graphs is available for each animal. These data are useful in establish - ing normal growth, but in addition make it possible to determine the relationship of various skeletal measurements to weight, show in a pictorial way the development of the udder, and many other things. The department is constantly trying to improve on methods of manufacturing dairy products. Just at present experiments are being ■carried with the purpose of developing a cream cheese that will be more uniform and will keep longer. The experiments have progressed far enough that it is believed that a publication is warranted telling of the new methods. Cheddar cheese is a product that is produced in Nebraska and has been of a very uneven quality. Poor milk supplies, unfavorable weather conditions and various factors have been contributing factors. Quality cheese can be produced, it is believed, under even unfavorable conditions and the methods of doing it are being experimented with. Then too, Cheddar cheese is now canned, ripened in the can, and marketed to the consumer in that container. For more than a year experimental work has been carried on with canned cheese and it is believed that this method may offer a means for Nebraska cheese makers to produce a high class product. In conducting experimental work it has been the constant endeavor of the department to attempt to solve the more important problems of the dairy farmer and the dairy manufacturer in so far as the equip - ment and the personnel would permit. Some of these experiments are of short duration and yield rapid results, while others require years of study before results are available. True research is the constant search for facts that will benefit mankind. Discussion after Mr. Davis' talk. QUESTION: What does your vitamin concentrate consist of? ANSWER: It is a concentrate made from cod liver oil. QUESTION: Were these calves about the same age when started? Looks like that bull calf might have been a little runty. </seg>
            <seg id="p300">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ANSWER: No, they are approximately the same age and of the same size. That bull calf has made a very remarkable growth. To be frank with you, I did not think he would live. The Jersey breeders, however, probably wouldn't agree. QUESTION: Is it your opinion that the small one will likely not be as large as the other one on the right? Was he stunted any in growth ? ANSWER: I don't know, though it is true that males grow faster than females. QUESTION: Did the small calf have any whole milk? ANSWER: Only three days with his mother. QUESTION: What is the cost of feed for these calves? ANSWER: Well, figure it up. They had around 8G0 pounds of whole milk, 1150 pounds of skim milk and a gallon of concentrate at $3.35 per gallon.

The committee representing this organization would like to see the program for the eradication of Bang's disease and mastitis continued and have a greater percentage of our herds on test. The State Dairy - men's Association can aid in this program by furnishing information to farmers and dairymen with reference to these two diseases. In the past the Nebraska State Dairymen's Association has spon - sored 4-H Club work and aided materially in its growth. The last few years the premiums for 4-H Club work in dairying at Nebraska State Fair have been severely cut. The committee feels that the State Dairy - men's Association should make every effort possible to have the pre - miums on exhibits for 4-H Dairy Calf Clubs restored or increased this next year. The Nebraska State Dairymen's Association favors the continu - ance and increase of Dairy Herd Improvement work. Herd Testing, and Better Sires Contests. The committee wishes to thank the Breed , Associations for their efforts the past year and hope they will continue their cooperation. The committee also appreciates the assistance of the National Breed Asso - ciations and their representatives, Mr. Holden of the American Guern - sey Cattle Club, Mr. Idtse of the American Jersey Cattle Club, Mr. Heiser of the Holstein-Friesian Association of America, and Mr. Conklin, Aryshire Breeders' Association.

Mr, Cook. MR. COOK: In introducing these two boys, I am going to take a minute to tell you a little bit about what they are doing Tn their work There has been a feeling among you for some time in regard to the quality of milk and cream that comes in to the market. The e fnaVTf, CatUe ° U lmnd tO lnCleaSe Ule qUality of CIeam a"* elim - inate all this poor cream and butter. So we thought we could start hte ~' thl r ° USh °- « club boys. We got Doctor Downs to come to Hamilton County last summer and we talked this over. We had about four teams that became interested in making a demonstration on cream quality. There are a lot of phases on the quality of cream We had a number of suggested demonstrations to work on but the boys were all interested in how to determine quality cream and he effect of having that on the market. With the help of Doctor Downs hese boy S worked up this demonstration and put it on at the county fan and won first place. Then they came to Lincoln to the State Fair and won first place there. That allowed the boys to go to St as°a whnL hi H U ! C dem ° nstration created ™«&lt;=h interest and enthusiasm a new tvn ,% *" Wer ?. placed at the end of the list because it was a ne* tjpe of demonstration.

And now, I want to introduce to you Ivan Stauffer and Robert Cornelius who will present this demonstration for you DEMONSTRATION— Cream Quality and How to Determine It. mnrnT^ T™ giVe US yOur a "^tion for a few minutes this 71 fw ? 7 , R ° bert C ° rneHUS aDd l ' Ivan Stauffer ' of a 4-H i dairy club at Phillips.

ROBERT: About eighteen months ago out of a clear sky, the </seg>
            <seg id="p304">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE food and drug administration of the U. S. Department of Agriculture seized and condemned several cars of butter in the east. The price of butter at that time was such that the loss on each car was about $35,000. Naturally, the industry woke up in a hurry and sent com - mittees to the administration in Washington to see what it was all about. They found that the food and drug administration had per - fected a new filter test for butter by which test they could determine the amount of extraneous matter in butter. By extraneous matter we mean all foreign materials. Incidentally, they found that a number of industries other than dairy were being cleaned up in a like manner — the salmon, blueberry and apple industries. The committee found that the food and drug administration, through microscopic examin - ation of the extraneous matter in the butter, was fully aware that at least 90 per cent of the extraneous materials were in the cream when it left the farm. The administration has made it plain to the com - mittee that they are not going to help so far as the farmer or cream producer is concerned. That is up to the producers. Further, they have made it plain that although creameries were ready to perfect new methods by which the extraneous matter could be removed from the cream, that was not enough. The food and drug administration insists that the manufacturer shall not buy cream that contains an excessive amount of extraneous material. When one stops to consider that in 1933 there were about five million farms in the United States which produced cream for butter making purposes, one can realize what a gigantic task the butter manufacturer has before him. The farmers are somewhat behind the rest of the cream manufacturing divisions in realizing their responsibility in putting clean cream upon market. We shall now enact for you a scene showing how this pro - gram of cream quality will influence butter consumption. IVAN: Hi, Bob, where have you been all this time? ROBERT: I've been right in the middle of harvest and haven't been in town for two weeks. IVAN: This cream must be a little old. See that white mold on top? ROBERT: You're not going to taste that stuff, are you? IVAN: Sure. I have to in order to grade it. By the way, do you know that the government will now only allow buying cream on grade? ROBERT: No. I haven't been in town for some time. IVAN: Well, the government won't let cream that is moldy or unclean be used for butter-making purposes. So we are buying on grade. </seg>
            <seg id="p305">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION ROBERT: Grade, what do you mean by that? IVAN: Grade is determined by the amount of sediment, the flavor and acidity of cream. This sample that I am taking from vour can will be used to tell whether it is clean and sweet. That can of cream is moldy, unclean, and is sure off flavor, so I can't buy it You see what that sign says? , ROBERT: Oh, well, if you don't Want it I'll take it over to Tom's station and sell it. He'll buy it all right. IVAN: Wait a minute, Bob. We have to get this straight You see that is a can of illegal cream and we are required by the State Department of Agriculture to take the name and address of each per - son who brings in a can of illegal cream. You will hear from this later unless I permanently discolor the cream. ROBERT: Now, wait a minute. I don't want any State Depart - ment getting on me. Is there any way I can get this straightened IVAN: Well, I can put some of this red dye into the cream so no one else will buy it. Then you can take it home and feed it to your hogs. That will save you a lot of trouble. ROBERT: Well, you do that and then tell me how I can have better cream next time. Second Scene (Robert brings in a new clean can of clean cream, yanks off the cover and greets Ivan enthusiastically). ROBERT: Ivan, look at this. Well, this is some different. I had some of it on my oatmeal this morning and it sure was good 1 ou won't have to hesitate to taste this. IVAN: It sure looks nice. Let's try the sediment and acid tests on it. This is good clean sweet cream and it is worth five cents a pound more than your No. 1 sour. ROBERT, You know, Ivan, I got to thinking on the way home the other night that it is a darned shame that a farmer produces cream that he won't eat on his own farm. If it isn't worth anything to the farmer can we expect a creamery to make it into butter that the public will eat and come back for more? Looking at some of the filthy cream I have brought in here the past year, you couldn't blame anyone for wanting a substitute in place of butter made from that stuff. IVAN: That is right, Bob, and here are samples of two kinds of butter. Take them home and try them for yourself. If more of the </seg>
            <seg id="p306">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE cream producers would just get that idea into their heads, there wouldn't be any butter sale problem at all. ROBERT: No thanks, Ivan. We have plenty or this kind at home and I don't want the kids to taste the other or it would be no more butter for them. Well, I must be going up the street and get some groceries. I will be back after my check and can later. IVAN: All right, Bob that will give me a chance to make the test and get your check ready. '■:■■■■•■'.. So the scene closes with the moral expressed — don't expect other people to eat butter, and want more, made from cream you wouldn't relish yourself. We will be glad to try to answer any questions that anyone has related to our demonstration. MR. COOK: They have asked me to say a few words regarding one of these boys, in view of the fact that he is only here for today and will be unable to attend the rest of the meetings and the dairy banquet, since he has examinations to take, play practice, play basket - ball, and a few other things. Robert Cornelius has been chosen as the Hamilton County 4-H club champion and also the champion among the Holstein calf clubs of Nebraska. Bob has not been in club work very long but is beginning to build his own herd. He took hold of this demonstration work this year and you can see what a record he has made in that. He came to the State Fair and received some valu - able experience. Last year he was champion showman. Bob has a well-rounded program as he has been chosen as 4-H club champion for 1935. I'll ask him to say a few words. Robert Cornelius. ROBERT CORNELIUS: My father and other 4-H club members persuaded me to join the club. My father gave me a heifer with the understanding that the first calf was his. She is now grown up and I have a herd of three cows and I hope to keep up in the club work for awhile. MR. BRANDT: We will go on with the program now and Mr. O. E. Reed will speak to us. I will ask Professor Davis to introduce Mr. Reed. MR. DAVIS: I want to introduce to you a man who was an in - structor when I was in college and who was very kind to me in those days and has oftentimes helped me out. He is now connected with the Department of Dairying in the U. S. Department of Agriculture at Washington and we are very happy to have him with us today. He will speak on "What's Ahead for the Dairy Farmer". Mr. O. E. Reed. MR. REED: Your chairman has assigned me the rather difficult task of discussing what's ahead for the dairy farmer. It would be much easier to discuss what the dairy farmer has been through. </seg>
            <seg id="p307">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION In fact, although it is always much more IB interesting to look ahead than to look back, I i especially over a disagreeable past, it is essen- M ;^l|l tial sometimes to review the past to set a C™ clear glimpse of what's ahead. ' VUl *?-U * By " &lt;lairy farmer" of course, we mean the y&gt;^'-' JV|£ywl \ man who Is in the regular business of pro - ~'%S^KL fl MM ducing milk or butterfat as a means of mar - j keting the crops from his farm. We do not I Illean the man who normally milks one or two \j j cows for his own family milk supply, but who in hard times turns his product into m market channels. We do not mean the man O. E. REED who ls normally engaged in producing beef, Washington, D. C. but wno ln times oi low Prices for beef turns to milking his cows and to temporary dairy - ing. This shift to dairying during the last few years of the agricultural depression was one of the most important causes of the great increase in milk production, at a time when there was a declining consumer purchasing power and consequently a decreasing market demand for milk. I dare say few of these temporary cow milkers had the equipment, or the kind of cows, or the knowledge necessary to produce a good quality product or to make a profit. It was for them, largely a means of obtaining a cash income at a time when they were willing to trade their labor for any amount of cash, however small. These temporary dairymen, as well as countless numbers of inefficient dairymen of the regular class, not only failed to make a profit for themselves, but they put their unprofitable milk on the market and thus increased the troubles of the more efficient dairymen. This great influx of new milk producers in the industry, together with declining income of milk and butter consumers, created a situa - tion which was difficult even for the efficient dairyman to weather; it was still more difficult for the inefficient dairyman, and the temporary cow milker. As you know, the government through various agencies made strenuous efforts to bring about reemployment in cities and elsewhere, to increase consumer purchasing power. Economists now foresee better business conditions ahead and more money being paid in wages during the winter than was paid out last winter. This should have a very beneficial effect on the dairy industry. Also in various ways the U. S. Department of Agriculture gave attention to the problems of the dairy industry, both directly and in- </seg>
            <seg id="p308">XEPCKT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE directly. Indirectly, as conditions have been improved in other branches of farming, there has been a trend away from milk produc - tion into beef cattle and hogs. The removal of surplus stocks of butter and other dairy products from commercial channels and their distribu - tion to families on relief has been of direct benefit in maintaining prices, and the removal of thousands of diseased cows should also favor the dairymen by reducing the tendency to produce more milk than the country can use at a profit to dairymen. The disease eradication programs and other factors, such as high feed prices, better prices for old cows, and the regular cycle of milk cow numbers have served to check the expansion in numbers of milk cows, which had been going on since about 1928. According to the Bureau of Agricultural Economics, the number of milk cows in the United States is now about 2 or 3 per cent under the number a year ago, and 6 per cent under the peak numbers of two years ago. The number is down now to 184 cows per 1000 people, and that is the average ratio during the last ten years. It is expected that population will increase faster in the next year or so than the number of milk cows, which should further benefit the dairyman. Dairying cannot be conducted satisfactorily on an "in and out" basis, either for the "in and outer" or for the dairy industry itself. But since changes in the economic relation of the various branches of agriculture will likely always occur in the usual cycles, and since such changes will always cause a shift to dairying when dairying is more profitable than beef cattle or hogs or grain production, the regularly established dairyman must safeguard his business by being a more efficient producer of dairy products than the sideline or temporary cowmilker. In his ability to run his business efficiently lies his greatest opportunity for satisfactory profits in bad times as well as in good. In my opinion, nothing is more important in operating the dairy farm on a business basis, or in the most efficient manner, than the keeping of records of production on every cow in the herd, — records of feed cost, income and overhead. It is equally important also, to con - sider not only the herd but the whole farm. Proper records on the herd and on the cost of growing feed will enable any dairyman to build a better herd through selection and breeding, and to . grow or feed the crops that provide the greatest yield of milk producing nutri - ents at the lowest cost. Yet how many farmers who milk cows as a regular dairy business, keep such records of production on their herds? How many farmers know whether they are producing butterfat at a cost for feed that pays them more than if they sold the feed directly on the market? We have evidence from the herd-improvement association records of herds all </seg>
            <seg id="p309">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION over the United States that indicates a great range in the feed cost of a pound of butterfat. Last year we found, for example, that the average association cow, whose production was 322 pounds of butter - fat a year, produced a pound of butterfat at a feed cost of 17 cents. Those association cows whose average production was only 158 pounds of butterfat a year, or the same as the average for all cows milked in the United States last year, produced butterfat at a feed cost of 25 cents a pound. In other words, by selecting, culling, and feeding according to business methods, the average member of a dairy herd improvement association has been able to assemble the kind of cows that will pro - duce a pound of butterfat for 8 cents less feed cost than the kind of cows milked by the average man who does no testing or record keeping. With 809 associations in the United States and the 15,500 mem - bers of these associations setting such a splendid example of the value of testing and record keeping, why is it that any farmer who pretends to make a regular business of dairy farming fails to test and keep records? Why, in fact, should any farmer continue to feed 25 cents' worth of feed to get a pound of butterfat, when he might do as these other 15,500 farmers are doing on the average — that is, feed only 17 cents' worth of feed to get a pound of butterfat. If we consider any man who milks 6 cows or more to be a regular dairy farmer, there are according to the best figures available, about 1,380,000 regular dairy farmers. They milk about 15,850,000 cows, or 60 per cent of all cows milked. Yet only about 12 out of every 1000 such dairy farmers test their cows and keep records. Only 1.2 per cent, in fact. For the other 98.8 per cent of so-called regular dairy farmers, the greatest opportunity ahead is the opportunity to join a dairy herd improvement association. In our experimental work -we have found that pasture and forage crops are the cheapest feeds for milk and butterfat production. In&gt; general it costs less to produce the nutrients required for milk pro - duction in the form of legume hays and grasses than in the form of grain crops. Our feeding experiments have shown that good cows will produce economically on pasture and good quality legume hay, with a limited amount of grain or none at all. Many dairymen could re - duce their costs of milk and butterfat production substantially by giving more attention to the growing of good roughage and the de - velopment of permanent pastures, or growing supplemental pasture crops. Your own state experiment station no doubt can suggest a system of farming to provide year round pasture, or other roughage crops that will provide an abundant supply of good low-cost feed throughout the year. </seg>
            <seg id="p310">REPOf.T OF NEBRASKA STATE BOAKD OF AGRICULTURE Aside from the cheaper milk-producing nutrients provided by legume crops and pasture, these crops are important in the general upkeep of the soil fertility, and in diminishing erosion from wind and water. Farmers throughout the middle west should need no better demonstration of the value of grassland farming than that provided by the drouth and dust storms of 1934. Good soil from western states came all the way to Washington, a dusty and forceful reminder that the 40,000,000 acres plowed up during the war years must be retired to grass for the purpose of conserving our soil resources as well as for reducing surplus grain crops. Erosion on some soils has been sufficiently extensive to practically ruin the land for agricultural purposes. Numerous surveys by the Department of Agriculture and the state experiment stations have provided some very significant data in regard to the losses of soil on land in cultivated crops as compared with that on similar land protected by a cover of grasses and legumes. Substantial shifts back to grass and non-cultivated crops have already taken place in many parts of the country. To make the most of pasture grasses and legume hays they must be grazed or harvested and cured in a way to preserve their nutritive properties and retain their quality. Too many farmers fail to recognize the great importance of high quality in roughage, or the wide range of quality between hays properly and improperly cured and stored. Research long ago established the fact that forage crops are very different in their chemical composition and nutritive value at different stages of maturity. The dry matter of young rapidly growing grasses is high in protein, minerals, and vitamins, and low in crude fiber. As the plants mature, the percentage of protein decreases and that of crude fiber increases. In the Bureau of Dairy Industry, we have shown by actual feeding trials that these changes in chemical com - position are reflected in the quantity of milk produced. Grasses and legumes cut and cured in the earlier stages of maturity are more palatable, contain a higher percentage of protein, and are more efficient in maintaining milk flow than the more mature stages. It is highly important therefore to handle pastures and grass hays in such a way that they may be grazed, or harvested and cured when in their immature or highest nutritive stage. Because of the excellent feeding value of immature pasture grasses, good dairy management requires that some method be adopted for utilizing the grass in its best stage. Rotation grazing in some instances is a practical means of getting greater benefits from good permanent pastures. At Beltsville, we obtained from 10 to 12 per cent greater </seg>
            <seg id="p311">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION returns from rotation grazing than from the usual continuous grazing practice. Under conditions that produce more grass in the early spring than can be utilized by the herd, it is often advantageous to set aside a part of the permanent pasture and cut the surplus grass for hay or for making silage. Good silage can be made from crops com - monly used for hay and grazing, if they do not contain too much moisture and are finely cut and well tramped. Hay crops such as soy - beans and alfalfa may be made into silage when weather conditions do not permit their being made into good quality hay. Many crops will make palatable and nutritious silage also, if properly handled — Sudan grass, Johnson grass, cowpeas, clover and timothy, oats and peas, surplus pasture grasses ,in fact almost any grass or legume or mixture of the two ordinarily used for grazing or for hay. Lately there have been numerous reports of reproductive troubles in dairy herds in this region. There have also been reports to the effect that cows coming normally into milk are drying off more rapidly than usual. I am inclined to believe that these troubles are the result of nutritive deficiencies, and that they are perhaps in some way related to the drouth and its effect on roughage and other feed available for dairy cattle. There are three kinds of nutritive deficiency, besides general starvation, which are likely to occur under drouth con - ditions and which may produce delayed unfavorable effects on repro - duction and on milk flow. These are vitamin A deficiency, protein deficiency, and phosphorus deficiency. Vitamin A deficiency is likely to affect reproduction particularly; protein deficiency is likely to affect milk production; and phosphorus deficiency, both functions. In recent years, we have done considerable research on the nutritive deficiencies of roughage. We find that it is important to use good quality roughage, especially roughage with a high vitamin A activity, because of its beneficial effect on the general health and reproductive functions of dairy cows, and also on the nutritive value of their milk. We now know that vitamin A activity of hays and other roughage is closely associated with the green color of the hay, which indicates that we must pay particular attention to the curing of hays so they will retain as much of their green color as possible. In other words green feed is of the utmost importance to the health and reproductive function of our herds, and it must be provided either by pasture or by feeding properly cured roughage. Many studies have shown that the cost or value of feed is the largest item of expense in producing milk on most farms, with the cost of labor a close second. It is of the greatest importance, therefore, to market the feed through cows that will return the greatest profit or pay the biggest price for the feed. High-producing cows of course consume more feed per cow, but they return more milk or butterfat </seg>
            <seg id="p312">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE per pound of feed than low-producing cows. High-producing cows are more profitable also because they utilize labor more efficiently. One cow producing 500 pounds of butter fat would return much more income over cost of feed than 5 cows producing 100 pounds each, and the good cow would require considerably less labor in care and handling. Even the time required to milk a high-producing cow does not increase in proportion to the level of production. In our experimental work it required about 6 minutes per milking to milk a cow giving 5 pounds of milk a day, and only 2*4 minutes longer to milk a cow giving 10 times as much milk. But how to get a herd of high-producing cows, and I mean cows that are inherently or naturally high producers? High production per cow, obtained by forced feeding, is very different economically speaking than high production obtained from a cow that has the natural ability for high production. My answer is that we must de - velop high producing cows through breeding. And here again it is of the utmost importance to keep records of production on each cow in the herd. Such records not only will enable you to cull out the boarder cows, but they will show you what kind of heifers your herd sire is getting for you. Your "county agents and your dairy specialists from the State College have been stressing the importance of proving dairy sires in herd improvement associations throughout the state. Other states are doing the same. Our records show that of. all the sires in herd improvements association herds ■ that have been proved so far, only one-third were good enough to raise production, one-third lowered the herd production, and the other third left the level of production where it was. These figures give some indication of the chance you take when you select a young untried bull to head your herd. It is much safer to select a young bull whose sire has proved that he transmits high production to his daugh - ters, rather than to use an untried sire, either young or old. In our breeding experiments we are attempting to develop herds or strains of cattle that will approach purity in their inheritance for high levels of production. We are making considerable progress, and we are doing it by using one good proved sire after another, in succeeding generations. Theoretically, we should eventually produce herds or strains of such high degree of purity in their inheritance that practically all the females born in the herd will be high producers and the young bulls can be counted on to transmit high levels of pro - duction to their daughters. Some evidence of the progress we are making may be seen in the results with the Holstein herd at Huntley, Montana. Forty-nine young bulls bred in the Huntley herd, that were sons of 6 proved sires, have </seg>
            <seg id="p313">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION sired a total of 579 daughters in farmers' herds near the station. These daughters averaged 11,227 pounds of milk and 404 pounds of butterfat, an average increase of 1,452 pounds of milk and 57 pounds of butterfat over the production of their dams. It is worth noting that many of these records were made on farms where little or no grain was fed. Although the average production of all the daughters of these 49 young bulls was higher than the average of their dams, that is not the most important part of the story. These young bulls were so uniformly good in their inheritance for transmitting high production, that only 5 of the 49 lowered the average milk production of their daughters, and only three lowered the average butterfat production, and in each case by insignificant amounts. The development of "pure line production" herds will have a far - reaching effect on the future efficiency of our dairy cattle. Progressive dairy farmers and commercial breeders will be the ones to develop such herds and furnish the young bulls or female seed stock for the average farm herd. The Bureau of Dairy Industry this past year in cooperation with the State Agricultural Colleges began a comprehensive survey to de - termine what progress has been made in commercial breeding herds, and in college and experiment station herds, toward fixing an inherit - ance for high levels of milk and butterfat production. This is a part of the organized search for superior germ plasm among all classes of plants and animals inaugurated by the Department of Agriculture early last year. When all these dairy herds have been analyzed, it is expected that dairy cattle breeders will be in position to make more rapid progress in developing "pure line production" herds by concen - trating and extending the use of the superior germ plasm of outstanding strains and herds. And now, let me say a word about the quality of the product you offer for sale. It is well to remember that you are producing a food product, that the care with which you produce it is of much greater economic importance to you perhaps than any direct increased returns you may receive. Failure to produce a satisfactory product from the standpoint of sanitation and flavor may not be visible in your cream check, but the result is there. The creamery man cannot make a good quality of butter from a low grade cream. A great many consumers are influenced largely by the price of butter, especially in times of low incomes. Because lower quality of butter sells for a lower price, they buy the cheaper butter — the butter of inferior taste and flavor. Too often they fail to try the better butter at a higher price, they merely quit using butter of any kind. And your market suffers as a result. </seg>
            <seg id="p314">REPORT Ol" NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE I realize the difficulty and the discouragement of making the extra effort to produce clean, wholesome milk and cream, when you get no more for it than your neighbor who is not so particular. But great progress has been made to correct that condition during the last year or so. Now that the creamery butter industry has taken such great interest in procuring only high-grade cream, and the Federal food and drug officials are cooperating to discourage the production and manufacture of butter from cream that is unfit for food, there is more than moral encouragement available to the dairy farmer who produces a good quality product. Many states have adopted cream - grading laws, and creameries are paying premium prices for quality. At one creamery, in a state in which an extensive cream-quality im - provement campaign was begun three years ago, only about 3 2 per cent of the cream delivered was sweet cream. In 1934 more than 62 per cent of the total amount of cream received at the creamery was sweet cream. The patrons of that creamery received a bonus of $52,500 for producing the high quality cream. In conclusion I want to impress upon you the fact that you are in the business of producing milk, along with about four million other farmers. In one sense, you are more or less in competition with each other. There are two ways to minimize the effects of this competition. Through cooperation with each other, you can take steps not only to market your milk and butterf at to better mutual advantage, but you can make an effort to control surplus production. As an individual, your opportunity to offset the effects of competitive milk production lies in your ability to produce more and more efficiently. Efficiency in milk production, as I have said, requires that you keep records, build up your herd through culling and breeding, and grow and feed those crops that will produce the cheapest nutrients for milk produc - tion. This kind of competitive dairying will do your neighbor no harm, but it will enable you to produce milk and butterf at at the lowest possible cost and therefore increase your net returns. More - over, your efforts will be reflected in lower prices to consumers and an increased outlet for your product. MR. BRANDT: We thank you, Dr. Reed, for that fine speech. And now Mr. Frisbie has a word for us. Mr. Frisbie. MR.

For believe me, you are not l|j:jip|W^K^K||||p| the only ones who have problems in this K^Hfl dairy world of ours. 1 { i ; to' fflJaJPifftK-;^ It has been my good fortune to have visited the great dairy sections of northern DEAN E. L. Europe on three different occasions during ANTHONY tne past twelve years. During these visits, I have lived for many months with the dairy farmers of Holland, Denmark, and England as well as some of their neighbors, and have had an unusual opportunity to observe them in their everyday life and business. Dairying, as we know it, started in Europe many hundreds of years ago. Like our own dairy development, it has been, however, essentially a home or domestic type of development until within recent years. It is still so in most sections, even more so than with us. The great commercial development is to be found largely today in Holland, Denmark and the newly developing sections of Finland, Poland, and Latonia; although there are sections in France, Switzerland and Ger - many where highly specialized dairy development is to be found, namely, in the Roquefort cheese cave sections in France, the con - densed milk and Swiss cheese sections of Switzerland, and certain special cheese sections of southern Germany. Inasmuch as Holland is the oldest dairy section of Europe as well as one of the most happy and prosperous, we will start with a visit to them. Holland, as you know, is situated in northwestern Europe, immediately east of England, north of Belgium and France and border - ing on the English Channel and the North Sea. It is better known as the marsh lands of Europe because it is low, flat, and swampy. It is a little country with water all about it and on it. In the early days, more than 2000 years ago, when semi-barbaric people migrated westward from the ancient sections of Asia and the Orient, certain tribes finally found themselves stopped in their wander - ings by the barrier of the North Sea. These people were pastoral people, essentialy herdsmen. They </seg>
            <seg id="p317">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION built their homes on the higher spots of ground and allowed their came to graze the luxurious grass from the lowlands. Thus this section, from the early day, became a cattle country. They made cheese from their milk which, together with hides, formed their chief item of trade. Here, by their herds and a close study of the opportunities of their land, they became a prosperous and well contented nation, and have succeeded in remaining so even today. Even in the face of the great conflicts which have consumed the interests of Europe for centuries, and especially the past quarter of a century, they have continued happy, peaceful, and prosperous. Because their main sale is cheese and condensed milk, which always by the nature of it brings a low net price for the milk from which it is made, the Hollanders have always had to figure on cheap costs of production. They are the cheapest milk producers in the world. They have solved the problem of producing for the market, let the market be what it may. They have done this by making their production on roughage and pasture which can be grown on their own land at low cost, and de - veloping an animal especially suited to their needs. This is the home of the Holstein cow. For centuries, the Hollanders have supplied the rest of the world with cheese of the highest quality. They have been frugal, hard workers, but most of all hard thinkers. They have met the problem of selling a product at a low price to other people of the world where the standard of living was low, yet producing this product of a quality which would hold their markets against competition and 'Still secure a profit for themselves which has allowed them to pay $800 to $1000 an acre for their land and maintain a standard of living higher than their competitors. For fear some of you may think that this has been done without facing problems, let me say that the problems of Holland dairymen are many and great. First, high land cost, the constant fight against water, poor drainage, disease of cattle, shortage of land that can be plowed, all of these make some of our problems in a new country of abundant Strong land, with favorable growing seasons and condi - tions, look very enviable to our Holland counsins. We have only to go away from home to realize how simple some of our problems are if we will only get to work on them. Due to the increasing nationalism and self sufficing development in many of the neighboring countries where they have sold their products, the Hollanders are faced with the prospect of a decreased market. This means that they already are looking with enviable eyes at our American markets as possible outlets for future produc- </seg>
            <seg id="p318">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE tion. They are possible future competitors of our own dairymen and with their careful study, close cooperation, and low costs, they always stand as a real threat to our American dairymen. From Holland, we will next skip to Denmark as the other great dairy center of Europe. Denmark is a new dairy country, scarcely much older in its dairy development than m^ich of the United States. It is a little country about one-fourth the size of Nebraska, and with a population of three and one-half million people. It is north of Ger - many along the North Sea. It is a flat land of naturally poor quality, being gravelly and swampy, with short seasons and short sunlight and warmth. The Danish people, until about a half century ago, were great grain growers, supplying the industrial northern Europe, England, Germany, Belgium, etc., with its extra grain supplies. With the settling of our great Central West, following the Civil war, we were able to put into European markets grain at a much cheaper cost than could the Danes. They were in much the same fix that we are in today in that they had lost their world export markets for grains as we here in the last few years lost ours. They faced a great agricultural adjustment just as we do today. It was hard times for them for several years, just as it is and will be hard times for us as we make the adjustments now facing us. The Danes in 1870-1900 turned to live stock as a solution of their problems. They found that England, a near neighbor, because of her great industrial development and small acreage of suitable farm land, could use large supplies of butter, bacon, and eggs. These the Danes set about to produce. The story of their struggle to develop a changed agriculture which would allow them to live on their land is a story of greatest interest to our American Dairymen as they have just passed through a shift and change which can serve as an excellent lesson to us in many respects. It was necessary for them to develop a breed of cattle especially suited to their needs. This they have done in the Red Danish Milk Breed, the youngest breed of dairy cattle ir the world, but with the enviable record of being the highest average producing breed of any of the great world breeds. Inasmuch as their market was for butter of high quality, it was necessary for them to develop cooperative crelameries where they could standardize the quality and safeguard the product from the farmer's barn to the consumer's doorstep. Today in Denmark, of the some 1700 creameries more than 1500 are cooperative. </seg>
            <seg id="p319">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION' With skim milk left on their hands, they turned their attention to quality bacon, also for England. This demanded a special type of hog. This they did not have, but also have produced so that today Danish bacon commands a higher price in England than the finest quality English bacon from English Yorkshire hogs. They also seized the chance to supply England with a large per - centage of her fresh egg demands. In this change, largely in the last third of a century, the Danes have changed their agriculture until they produce not only what their own people need but supply Eng - land with more than forty per cent of its butter needs, 35 per cent of its egg requirements, and 45 per cent of its bacon demands This is an enviable record of adjustment and accomplishment. It has not been secured without trials or problems, however. It again has meant close study of the problems, close cooperation of the farmers; in fact, Denmark is the home of cooperation. It has been accomplished against the handicaps of poor land, short seasons, export hazards, and enviable and increasing competition from other countries such as Fin - land, Poland and others also interested in this English market. Danish farmers today have the highest standard of living and prosperity of any of the farmers of Europe. They face increasing difficulty of holding this place. They, too, are finding it difficult to get England to consume as much as they can supply. They have solved two great problems, that of quality production and low costs. They are, too, looking with enviable eyes at our American markets and stand ever ready to flood our markets at any favorable opportunity. England, including Scotland and the Channel Islands, is a great dairy section, essentially however concerned with fresh or liquid milk production. There is, however, in certain parts, a large amount of special types of English cheese produced, largely made on the farms and not in factories. England, because of its peculiar climatic conditions, is the finest pasture land of the world. Much of the dairy production of England is produced on pasture hay and roots. English production is neither so carefully developed as to quality or low cost as in Holland or Den - mark. For this reason, English farmers have difficulty meeting the competition of their neighbors. English farmers are not as good dairymen as either the Danes or Dutch. They are great livestock producers, however. It is to England and English breeders that we owe most of our livestock development. They are the master breeders of the world, and nowhere will better live stock as a whole be found. Now in conclusion let us review the dairy set-up and situation as it stands in Europe today. </seg>
            <seg id="p320">REPORT OK NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OK AGRICULTURE In those countries where dairying has had its most successful de - velopment, we find the highest standards of living, security of people, and general prosperity. Recognizing this, many new sections of Europe, like Finland, Poland, Latonia, etc., are rapidly developing dairy farming. With intense nationalism, self-sufficing and export limitations dominating the center of Europe today, Europe is rapidly approaching the point of burdensome dairy supplies for which they must find a market. With their solution of low cost methods of production and control of quality, they stand as never before as a growing threat against our own American dairymen. Only as we study their methods, under - stand their problems, and match them by our own more efficient methods and practices can we hold our American markets and hope to safeguard our higher standards of living desired by our American dairymen. At this time Professor Anthony showed several slides made from pictures of European dairying. QUESTION: To what extent does the silage spoil when put up that way? ANSWER: Just the outside — about 8 to 10 inches on the top and sides. The top, however, is covered with dirt. QUESTION: Could we do the same thing here? ANSWER: We use silos and have better ways of preserving it here. QUESTION: How does the disease problem compare? ANSWER: Disease is very, very prevalent. There is a lot of tuberculosis — about 50 to GO per cent in Denmark, whereas we hold ours to a low through the constructive program of the U. S. Department of Agriculture and we have many things to be thankful tor. There is much mastitis in Holland. MR. BRANDT: Now, friends, this concludes the program for this afternoon so we will adjourn. ."-,■■■■; Meeting of Nebraska Holstein Friesian Association, held Thurs - day morning, January 9. Dean E. L. Anthony, of the Michigan State College, addressed the meeting on the subject. The Solection of the Herd Sire. MR. ANTHONY: The comments made by Mark Twain regarding the weather, namely, "That while everbody talks about it, nobody </seg>
            <seg id="p321">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION* does much of anything about it", may be very suitably applied to the subject assigned me. The selection of the herd sire is certainly a problem of great im - portance to every dairy herd owner In the United States. How great this importance may be is not generally realized by the average herd owner. Few men stop to consider that the average length of life of the average dairy herd is around fifteen years and that the average herd owner even in selecting a new herd sire each three or four years would only face the problem of herd sire selection less than a half dozen times in his active experience as a dairy herd owner. This, of course, does not apply to every one as herds can be named that have been going for more than a quarter of a century. On the other hand, all of us can recall the countless number of herds we have known that have had less than ten years of active development and have used only two or three bulls. It is an old trite saying that the sire is half the herd. This is without doubt fully true, and if so, then one should spend fully as much time, money, and attention in the herd sire selection as is to be given to all of the female part of the herd. We know that few breeders do this. The lack of study and time given to this important problem in our herd development is certainly one of the major reasons why so little real herd progress is made by the average breeder and why so many disappointments seem to be the lot of so many breeders. Most men fail in herd sire selection because they put too little time and attention to the study of all of the angles of the problem. It is true that they have heard the statement that the sire is half of the herd but they do not fully comprehend what it means. The selection of the herd sire, to most men, is a distasteful job to be finished as quickly as possible. It is also a matter that is never anticipated and adequate plans made in advance. Yet it should be a matter of con - stant study, with plans made far in advance of any change that is to come in the use of the herd sire. It is my observation that many herd sires must be considered but few chosen. There is no better time and money spent than in hunting up the right herd sire. For the last quarter of a century our college folks have taken an active part in advocating the importance in herd sire selection and In bringing to herd owners the principles which must be considered in this all-important problem. Much useful information has been developed and disseminated </seg>
            <seg id="p322">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE through their efforts and studies. Yet when we look over the re - sults of their own efforts to practice what they preach with their own college herds and in their own herd sire selection we find that they have all too little to show in the way of success for their efforts. I know I am damning my own colleagues as well as myself when I make such a statement. I know also that many an alibi and justifiable excuse can be offered by many institutions — lack of funds, changing per - sonnel, changing administrative policies, disease, etc., have all been a part of the handicap of colleges and experiment stations in their failure to show more results for their theories and teaching. Nevertheless I think the indictment stands today that our college folks have been long on theory and advocations but short on execution and results. For this reason I sometimes think it would be better if we college men stayed in the background rather than appear before you on this topic until we have larger amounts of tangible evidence that our advocations in herd sire selection were more generally successful. Bearing this in mind, I hope you will allow me to discuss the matter of herd sire selection with you from the angle of an observer of cases of success and failure rather than as an exponent of any special theory or advice. "We have passed from first one theory to another in our herd sire selection during the past quarter of a century. You all remember full well when it was suicide to select any bull except that his dam had a big seven-day record or was a great show cow. Many are the grave - yards of breeding establishments act up on this program. The next step was the phenomenal year record on the part of the dam as the sure guide post of success, and again many have been the delusions and disappointments, the long prices paid for such bulls and the results secured. * This early emphasis on abnormal records in both show rins and production has in turn been followed by the more recent enthusiasm for so-called "proved bulls". Here again there have been disappoint - ments, although far less so than in the earlier theories. We are just now beginning to talk in terms of a new theory, that of pure germ plasm. It bids fair, I think, to offer us more real progress and assurance in our problem of future herd sire selection than some of our past theories. With so little actual pure* germ plasm about, however, and so little known as to where it is, it is still a future theory or tool which time will tell us as to how much we can make it serve us in our attack on better herd sires. : • While I do not have a fool proof plan or solution to advocate to </seg>
            <seg id="p323">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION you in the matter of solving the problems in herd sire selection, I have for the past twenty-five years been closely connected with several large breeding herds and with assisting breeders in their attempts to Improve their herds.

From this you may be able to figure out what may be some of the useful things to observe in the selecting of a herd sire. (This was followed with a discussion of the selection and results of the use of the following bulls: Leto, Modesty Oxford Majesty, Cora's Cherub of Shorewood, Varsity Piebe LaVertex, Leto's Exchange, Fauvic Prince). Mr. Earl Cooper gave a talk on Holstein Progress. MR. COOPER: We had this morning two real talks by two real men who are closely connected with the business. I spent a couple of days working out my speech. I want to say that six years ago, I was here, and every year for the past five years my Holstein friends and other friends in the dairy industry have invited me to come back. Last year I wrote them and told them I would be their toastmaster in 1930 if they asked me, and here I am; not as close to the Holstein people or the dairy industry as I used to be. This morning I had chosen one of two subjects: "The Selection of the Herd Sire" or "The Value of Continued Testing". Nothing more need be said because the subjects have beon wonderfully covered. As regards the future and progress that we can make in the Hol - stein Breeders Association, one of the most essential things that we must do to make progress is to look back over our breed for fifty years, which we did this summer when we went to Mr. Stewart's place - near Seattle. We saw cattle that really went back to their original strain, a full herd of cattle brought into this country and successfully managed across this land and are now going to the Orient, and during those years a lot of progress has been made. I can well remember when I went into the work as a boy and I can very well remember then the type of the breed. We had then a tremendous amount of slopers — many of them in every herd, and then along came the true type. You all recall what influence the true type had on the breed. Consequently since that time the breed has been bred for type that goes along with the production we want. Needless to say we have a very different looking Holstein than we did in 1921. We have an entirely different looking outlook on i the way of production. We have gotten away from the records somewhat; some people talked about their fifty pound cow and their seventy </seg>
            <seg id="p324">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE pound cow. A Holstein cow could produce that and did many times, but just look at what we have today — long time records including cows that have given in their life time in eight to ten lactations over 800 pounds of fat and 20,000 pounds of milk. That is some real progress in any breed and it is from cows that have that ability to produce over that long period of time that we can determine the animals that can turn out that amount of fat. We pick the Ail-American in football, basketball, and the world of sports. We stamp him the man who has the greatest ability to go through and play the game. So we have animals that are Ail- American in production and show rings. If you will look at the All- American and then look at the records, the All-American Holstein cow has a fat production of nearly 800 pounds of fat in three-time records. She is certainly a cow capable of type and production — a true All-American. Kick, pass, run — and how we are going there as a breed and I believe we are making real progress along that line. Now to talk about something for a little while that I think is essential if the dairy industry is going to make progress. I wish you would have heard Dr. Munn give his speech this year. He is presi - dent of the National Dairy Council, and as usual, he gave his speech to people who didn't need it. He pointed out some definite truths that should be followed if we are going to make progress in the dairy business and that is that there is no use developing better production unless we bring this nation of ours to a greater consumption point. Unless we can strike out as a union of dairymen and raise the con - sumption of every last man, woman, and child in this United States, we have probably enough milk cows for all we will consume. We are not consuming enough. I don't suppose there is an average farm family that is consuming enough milk. Some probably take out their eight to twelve quarts daily, but I can tell a better one than that; in Wisconsin a farmer's family consisting of four children takes out one measly quart a day because they find they can get more on the market for It. These shysters are the ones that aren't consuming their share of the milk. They have got to be told first that if they will consume a proportionate amount of milk in their farm family to - gether with butterfat, butter, and cheese, they will take up all the surplus of milk and we won't have to worry about any surplus in that. Then, we could start on the average city family of five and they are probably using one quart a day, so look at the way we can go. Too, we are not nearly the cheese consumers we ought to be. Our stomachs are supposed to hold so much. We can take those four quarts of milk into our family and we don't need to compete with anything else, that is, not a farm product. We don't need a lot of things we do have, but we cannot get along without the essential dairy cow. </seg>
            <seg id="p325">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION' The number of cows is less and Dr. Munn says he are going back - wards. We must raise consumption and that means consume it our - selves and get other people to do it. We have depended all these years on someone else to sell milk. The dairymen have done very little to sell milk and have been forced to clean out after a time be - cause they didn't do things for the good of the business. Evervbodv has been a booster in consumption— everybody but us. The doctors nurses schools, and generally everyone interested in health claim it is our business to drink milk. There has been no resistance to milk We must launch in to a program as dairymen to build up consumption of milk and other dairy products. Dr. Munn pointed out some great truths. Forty-five million farmers in the U. S. and only m quarts of milk going to the average family of five. Everybody is with you and none to resist you. In six leading women's magazine* for threP months, of the 237 full pages in those six leading women's magazines only thirteen were on milk. This is the problem of the dairy industry To point out a future, milk and dairy products must advertise like cocoa, flour, .salt and other things, must advertise on the radio through the papers and magazines and put it into the homes On» morning recently we had cooked cereal for breakfast. One of our boys sa.d "Phooey". Then he told us he didn't need to eat cooked cereal because, "Dad", he said. "You don't heat coal before you put it in your furnace". He had heard that over the radio. He also listened to a series of talks on vitamin A and was truly convinced that that was a very necessary thing to the diet. However, that illustrates my point about the rudio. We must build up consumption and then we will have no trouble in keeping our production up. Most anyone will agree that we have the cows, the feed, and the men, and it is up to us to build up this consumption where it normally ought to be. Another thing, our future work depends upon all the young people and Nebraska young people, and we had a living example this morn - ing. I happen to be proud of the fact that we started that work when I was with the association who awarded a national prize to the champion entry and young man. I see many of them active in the New England states exposition. One young man who won this is now a deputy in the Food and Drug Department, but he is an outstanding man today in the development of our breed and the dairy industry, so we have that and no one can take away our young people, but it is up to us to help develop them. I see too many faces of the 200 boys and girls at Waterloo saddened, some shed a few tears because they had lost, but in a few cases it was because they had had a rotten animal to start with. There are not so many of those now, but what I mean is developing all breeds and see to it that every boy and girl gets some - thing that is a credit to that breed and I am not worrying about our </seg>
            <seg id="p326">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATIC HOARD OF AGRICULTURE breed or any breed because they will make progress. I am in a position now to look at our own cattle association with - out fear and can talk as I feel because when you are working for an association you are not always free to say what you would like. What I mean is this. Starting with our state associations and carrying right on through to the national association, I would say that we have not mapped out in the right direction for years. I remember this epitaph in a Wisconsin cemetery. "As I am you soon shall he, prepare for death and- follow me". Then inscribed under this was "To follow you is not my intent, until I find which way you went". We are now coming out of a period of five year crisis and we should thank the national association for the things they have done because they have had a lot of things to do. We are somewhere now where we have to select a goal and we are going to do something re - garding milk. We are going to go through with Holstein milk. I believe there are two points we must follow. Those who produce Hol - stein milk in a community and want to, put it on as a separate milk but put it with all the other milk and advertise it for what it is The breed association should, and if it is going in the right direction, con - tinue to supply the breeders with facts and things that will help them Consume milk, back the National Dairy Council, the dairy industry, and the Holstein industry, they are all equipped to help you. The state association has a definite program and you want to carry it to the finish. If I were working in the state association I would have a committee work out a five or six year plan and try to stand by it Include the promotion of milking, testing, and things we must do to make Holstein progress. During the afternoon. I will try to answer any questions that come up, or be like the darkey who came up before the judge for a misdemeanor. The judge asked him if he was guilty and he replied, "Yes, Your Honor, I'm guilty and I wish to waive the hearing." "What do you mean by 'waive the hearing? I don't want to hear anything more about it". Address by Mr. O. E. Reed, before the meeting of the Nebraska Guernsey Breeders Association, Thursday, January 9, on the subject, The Value of Continued Testing. MR. REED: I have had one experience in the past two and a half years that I want to pass on that you might be able to see the value of continued testing. One of the first things that Secretary Wallace did upon taking office was to appoint, a committee on genetics. I do not say much about this because I know so much about it. If he is interested in anything he is interested in genetics. He is a corn breeder, a poultry breeder and a breeder of dairy cattle. He </seg>
            <seg id="p327">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION called the committee the genetics committee of the Department of Agriculture Then he finally saw fit to make a germ plasm survey in he United States and elsewhere in the world, where it might lead to our information. This includes cattle, livestock and cotton We are working on this and have been during these years and hope to have the material for the printer on the 15th of next month, and it will be published in the Year Book for 1936. What is the relation of this to continued testing? When we started out to create this information we went to the experiment sta - tions to find out about this. We found a small number of records on livestock but quite a lot on crops. We had eleven crops and took a survey of some livestock with reference to germ plasm. It so hap - pens that we have done more work and better work with plants than with animals. However, we have a good reason why that is true In the first place, some of our young men have found it easier to make contributions when working with plants than when working with animals because of the cost. A handful of oats sowed will in five years, with any kind of crops, make a whole field, and he can go on and on and put those into crop improvement hands and he has really made a contribution. It is a different matter with livestock. This is shown where we have some results in keeping records. I have been in two or three institutions myself and I know what has been done in other institutions and I know too on this survey that we have gotten a piti - fully small amount of information. One reason is that the feeling is that all breeds must be kept and then the breeders can say, "Oh, yes, my breed is represented at the College of Agriculture". ' That is fine, of course, but do you know that is one of the greatest handi - caps that breeding calls for and that is we haven't got enough room and enough money to keep enough of these animals to get very much done. Disease has killed out some herds entirely and in some in - stitutions we have found good results because they have had enough material to work with. In our government herds we have tried to correct that by taking one or two breeds and some of our institutions have done the same thing and we find that there is a lot of information coming out of these herds. The Holstein people note that one of the greatest differences has been made since they started some line breed - ing and concentrated efforts. These people have had an opportunity to do that thing. What I am getting at is simply this, that the value is in keeping records and then studying these records in relation to this survey. Suppose we have one good lot of cattle. There is among you I think, someone who will ask if a certain animal will produce the kind of an animal you want. You have found that it sometimes is a very different animal than its parents, and it is hard to know what to do </seg>
            <seg id="p328">KEPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE about this unless you have kept records and have studied these records. Then you confuse type and production. I wish we could prevent that. I want type and everyone else does, but these are often con - fused. Of course we must keep up the type and it does not make any difference if we could just keep records to see which way we are going. In this day of economy it takes good judgment that does not forget type, but as yet we haven't the desired type. We've got to tell it and see what it is in that certain line that we want to keep. We must go on and upward in this breeding of cattle. Another thing that has been surprising to me and that is that our breed associations probably have not appreciated this, and I'm talking about the breeders and the value of continued testing, if they are going to appreciate it in the future. This work is getting strongly under way now, and there is a certain few from whom we are getting a lot of really reliable information in regard to this germ plasm work. Seventy-five per cent of all records in herds where we have animals will be records that have been made in the old fashioned cow testing associations. Now that is something to think about. You wouldn't expect that to go out and find most of your high line breeding stock, but some of us who have been in this game for 25 or 3 0 years are not surprised at that thing. It is sufficient to say that these fellows who have been in cow testing or herd improvement work for these many years have good records, and it is also a 'surprise to them that they have these records and that they are as good as they are. For illustra - tion, in Pennsylvania, one man and one woman have kept records for twenty years because they thought it was the thing to do. When they came to analyze these records they have found a wonderful lot of germ plasm there. They didn't know it. They hadn't studied them, and that has been found in many, many cases. We have gotten a lot of information that people, didn't know was available. Let us talk about the records that we now have rather than those in the future. The majority of the progress that have made in the breeding of our dairy cattle is the high animals that we are producing and to these men belong the honor. I could tell members of the Hol - stein Association about the respect for the foundation strain that we think a lot of today; and also the Jersey breeders, the wise ones that have worked for that mark, and I could give you examples and cases and breeders that we talk of today that have respected the real breed - ing progress. I could go into the Ayrshire breed and name the strong breeders and also that wonderful herd of Kimona owned by a man who appreciates the records and the value of continued testing. The man who keeps these records and does the testing will have cows that will give him his reward. I could go into the Guernsey breed and </seg>
            <seg id="p329">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION name breeders who have helped and made contributions to the develop - ment of their breed of cattle, and who believe in the value of continued testing. We might as well come down to facts and think this thing through. If you are a breeder, you must appreciate the continued testing and keep your records year in and year out. There is a lot of disappoint - ment in the breeding of livestock and there is a lot of risk that we have to take, such as disease, contagious abortion, tuberculosis and all of those hazards. Sometimes you think you are making a wonderful improvement— you may be and you may not. Some years the records will be high andsome years they will be low. Men get discouraged and go out of the business. This keeping of records is the all-important thing that you have fussed with and you are now ready to go ahead with a constructive program. Measure inheritance of an animal when you have a test on him. We have just had to discontinue a herd of our own because of a certain disease. If you have a herd and can keep them together, keep records year after year and you can develop those cattle. I had something to do with the establishing of the herd tests among the breed associations, and I am a strong advocate of the breed associations. I'll admit we are slow in making progress, but we are making progress, definite progress, and more definite progress for 1936 than we have ever made in the past. I will say little about the old Holstein records which date as far back as 1893. There were some changes made in 1908 and 1910, and a little progress made from time to time. The old 7-day records were thought to be the thing. In 19 OS and 1910 the yearly records were started though not much progress was made along this line until 1925. Then in 1925 the herd tests came and the 7-day business came to ah end with a bang. We used to run the cow up to 50 pounds and then she would drop like a thud. Now the herd test comes and you will find that this is what happens; it puts all cows on a yearly basis where you will get the value from testing. Our breed associations are headed up. There may be a few things to hold them back, but in general our prospect is upward and onward. I can see a lot in the future for them in a contributing way upon this testing. The testing that is going to bring this about is the continued testing on your farm. Take men who have a little money to spend and want to get a good herd together. They will go to the lowliest of places and try to swipe or "steal" as they say, an animal that has good backing — such as Bob Hagen did with Minerva. He took her, got her in shape and brought her to the National Dairy Show. It was even said that he'd probably have her stuffed after she died and still bring her to the show and take a prize. Bob went into the wilds of Wisconsin to find that cow. Wisconsin does have the good Guernsey herds, wonderful character. I have seen it happen so often — the combining of strains — this fellow and that, and that is the mak- </seg>
            <seg id="p330">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ing of progress and the keeping of these strains. "We are making progress but we will make even greater progress if we will keep to a certain strain. As Dean Anthony pointed out, what makes a good bull is a record. That reminds me of something one of the great breeders told me the other day. Some of the college fellows don't know how to breed cattle. He told me how a certain fellow had this all planned out. They were on a trip and had stopped at a substation for a visit. The young fellow upon seeing a bull remarked that it was a disgrace for the United States to own anything like that. This happened to be the promoter of a great strain, and I have seen it happen so often as Dean Anthony pointed out, it takes a record to show those things. Then he said he came up to the fence and sat upon it and the others were watching to see what he would have to say about the bull. He was an ornery looking critter, but he was the producer of many good producing daughters. Perhaps when we get old like that we can't keep up appearances either. You can know more about your breed in your herd than anybody else if you will keep records on your cattle. We want records that are honest records that you can see and use in the development of your work, and we want continuous records. You may have some records on your cows, but they should be taken year in and year out. If you keep records and keep breeding better cattle, then there will be a beaten path to your door for breed - ing stock. This is something worthwhile to the dairy industry, this building of livestock, and one of the greatest businesses that I know. It has brought an inspiration to make something that will be ideal. We will make progress if you will keep on with your records. There is no short course on these records, and it is not an easy thing to do but it is building for better animals, and if you keep these records they will encourage you. Secretary Wallace, if he has done nothing else in his administration, has made the farmer and the student of agriculture germ-plasm conscious. He has been worthy of the high office which he holds and we have through him the committee who ia working on this great study. And we are finding material in places where we had never looked before, wonderful information that we didn't know about. So people are thinking about it as never before because we are not going to get anywhere with these four breeds of dairy cattle unless we know something about them. The main thing is to keep up and keep these records for better and more constructive breeding. </seg>
            <seg id="p331">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION - STATE FAIR EXHIBIT It is probably justifiable to say that the exhibit of the Nebraska State Dairymen's Association is one of the traditional features of the numerous displays in Agricultural Hall at the Nebraska State Fair. This annual display serves not only to round out the exhibits of this interesting building, but is a means of reaching a large number of people with information pertaining to dairy cattle and dairy products. In the exhibits during the last few years greater emphasis has been placed upon the food value of dairy products and the production of quality milk and cream. With the information constantly before us that our rural and urban populations do not consume sufficient quantities of dairy products, consistent either with food economy or good health, it has appeared desirable to stress this particular phase. Realizing that consumption increases will be greatly retarded unless products of the highest quality are offered to the public, and that quality of the raw material largely governs the quality of the product manufactured therefrom, it has appeared wise to stress this particular phase also. The officers of the association are grateful to the State Fair Board for the new location for the dairy exhibit. Located now, we hope somewhat permanently, in the west central portion of Agricultural Hall the incentive will be even greater to prepare a creditable exhibit. This year the exhibit was completely enclosed with large milk bottles (4 ft. wide and 10 ft. high) in which openings were made suf - ficiently large to allow observation of the educational material attrac - tively displayed behind them. The various sections of this year's display depicted the numerous ways of using butter and its value as a food, the comparative value of oleomargarines and butter as a source of Vitamin A and the method of determining the Vitamin D content of milk. In addition, a revolving table displayed types of display ma - terial which are available from the National Dairy Council and which would be suitable for use in schools. A mechanical display rented from the National Dairy Council depicted the production of milk, the products manufactured from milk and the high food value of these products. The "butter statute" as it has become known, this year consisted of a picture of the famous cow La Vertex Quantity of U Neb. This was shown as a 40 x 50-inch hand colored enlargement in a 10-in. frame of butter resting on a butter easel. This cow holds the world's record for life time milk production, having produced 227,831.8 pounds of milk containing 8.455.5 pounds of butter fat in ten lactation periods. The following photographs more completely describe this year's display. </seg>

When we departed from St. Louis our pleasures were not ended. Mr. Frisbie led our group through the winding, rocky Ozarks. We even ferried across their great lake. No one could participate in such a trip and not feel that every minute was well spent and filled to the brim with something new and interesting. Besides this our team had the privilege and real joy of com - peting with twenty other teams for judging honors. Even though we didn't win any great honors, which I deeply regret, we each have the satisfaction of knowing that we did our best and will take the defeat without squealing. The National Dairy Show had been the goal of our team for years. Now that we have reached this top round of the ladder, I feel that the effort has been worth while, ana that the trip is price - less. We are greatly indebted to your association for making this dream come true. I. hope that the teams of '36 will enjoy and find the trip as worthwhile as we did this year.

Some of the most interesting things to me on that trip were the sight of the Mississippi river by moonlight and sunrise, the demonstrations at the Fair Grounds, the St. Louis Zoo, the Lindbergh trophies, the stay at the Lake of the Ozarks and Bagnell Dam, and picking hickory nuts and persimmons on the way home. For these .memories and many others, we thank you. "Very truly yours, HAROLD BORMAN, Papillion, Nebraska.

            <seg id="p367">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION HOME ECONOMICS SECTION PROGRAM TUESDAY MORNING Mrs. Ernest Overtoil, Presiding Jhe session was opened with two musical numbers sung by the Farm Operators' Glee Club. They were directed by Mrs. Altinas Tullis and accompanied by Mrs. A. L. Frolik. The Glee Club sang "Sing Me A Chantey" by Wessley and "The Blind Ploughman" by Clarke. Following this Miss Hazel Fricke played two violin solos, "Salut a' Amour" by Elgar and "Fras Quita" by Lehar. Miss Marian Hulflsh accompanied her on the piano. At the conclusion of the musical numbers, the women were asked to rise and repeat the collect. "Keep us, O God, from pettiness. Let us be large in thought, In word, in deed. Let us be done with fault-finding and leave off self-seeking. May we put away all pretense and meet each other face to face, without self-pity and without prejudice. May we never be hasty in judgment and always generous. Teach us to put into action our better impulses, straight-forward and unafraid. Let us take time for all things; make us grow calm, serene and gentle. Grant us that we may realize it is the little things that create differences; that in the big things of life we are as one. And may we strive to touch and to know the great common woman's heart of us all; and, O Lord God, let us not forget to be kind." —Mary Stewart. Mrs. Ernest Overton extended the president's greetings to the asso - ciation. President's Greetings Again it is my pleasure to greet you and open this thirty-first annual meeting of the Home Economics Section of Organized Agri - culture. We pause to review the many steps of progress that the home demonstration clubs have taken this past year. Last year with a membership of 19,500 and this year with over 26,000 members is the answer to our question, "Are we progressing?" We realize how it has elevated the American standards of living by first raising standards in individual homes. It deals in a practical way with practical things. </seg>
            <seg id="p368">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE It reaches out into rural sections and through close cooperation with government agencies, urges adoption of methods and equipment that will make life easier and provide more time and leave more energy for other things that are also worth while. Henry Wallace said, "The world is all one piece of ground. All civilized people are a part of an inter-dependent community." These words I found particularly fitting when I attended the National Home Conference in September at Columbus, Ohio. Women who represented rural communities from different sections of the United States discussed their problems and their efforts to raise local and national standards of living through a better adjustment of human relations. These ideals are penetrating into almost every state and are being carried forward. And we felt more than ever that the "world is one piece of ground". The home demonstration extension clubs have increased in number to such a vast extent that the women now feel they have a need for a national organization. Steps were taken at this conference and a tentative constitution was drawn up for a National Home Demonstra - tion Council. This constitution is to be adopted in Washington, D. C. next June at the third annual conference. This organization is to further strengthen, develop, coordinate and extend adult education in home economics through the cooperative extension service; to provide opportunity for homemakers in demonstration groups to pool their judgment of home and community life; and also to offer a means by which homemakers may initiate, interpret, and promote extension projects of national importance in the protection and development of the American home. This in itself is proof, I think, of what the rural women are doing to attain and maintain standards of living in keeping with the rights of the family and community. : ■ We are thankful at this time that tangled paths are smoothing. All of us realize (when we stop to think) that the great things of life are the simple things — contentment, a purpose to achieve and build companionship along the way. Where else can one hope to live this life except on our farms, so near every living, growing thing? Our youth of today will be the citizens of tomorrow. The rural club women have tried to accept this challenge by encouraging and cooperating with the splendid work of the 4-H clubs and their leaders in their teachings of heart, health, head and hand, and to help them hold fast and uphold fundamental American ideals and policies so they can go on to make America greater and more prosperous than ever before. </seg>
            <seg id="p369">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION I know at the end of these three days we will be better friends and that your stay will be of both value and pleasure. Let us use for our slogan: It's the songs we sing And the smiles we wear That makes the sun shine Everywhere. Following tho president's greetings, it was thought best to call the attention of the audience to the fact that several exhibits had been arranged on the second floor of the Student Activities Building. Mrs Overton introduced the various people who were to explain these exhibits. Explanation of Exhibits Muriel Smith: The canning exhibits are on the north side of the room upstairs Last year and this year the Ball Canning Company have conducted the Ball Canning Contest. The contestants' entries have been judged and the prizes awarded. This year there were sixteen entries, which is a nice representation. There was supposed to be in each entry one Jar of meat, one jar of fruit, and one jar of non-acid vegetable. Since it is quite a problem to transport canned material to the contest there was some spoilage. If this happened, there will be only one or two exhibits in some of the entries. Rizpah Douglass: I want to tell you about some other exhibits upstairs. We have four cases. The first two cases are toys which can be made at home You will find most of these toys described in the circular, "Toys You Can Make". These are not only ,for small children, but are suggestions for toys which can be made by an older child, who receives his enter - tainment by making them to give to his younger brothers and sisters. In the corner are other exhibits— little chairs, made out of orange crates, and dolls that have hair made of yarn. An older boy can make these, a boy in the first years of high school. West of these on the south side are two other cases. One of them contains inexpensive, decorative objects. The prices range from nothing or ten cents to about one dollar. These are pretty, yet in - expensive things. Many were purchased at the ten-cent store.' Homes can be made very attractive with things like these. In the next case is the antique exhibit. An antique is not an antique </seg>
            <seg id="p370">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE until it is fifty years old. These are all numbered so you can look at the number on the antique and see the description of each 'on a placard placed on one side of the case. Another case is reserved for antiques brought in by the women. If you tell us about them, a description will be put on the placard about them- also. We will be glad to have you tell us what you would like in the plans for these exhibits next year. Allegra Wilkens: You have heard about the exhibits to the north and to the south. Now you will hear about the exhibits on the east side of the room. We have tried to arrange the exhibits so they will be easy to see. These are the 4-II exhibits. This is a good time to plan for the 4-H club work for this year. There were 19,000 boys and girls enrolled for club work last year, and I think there will be an even larger enrollment of the boys and girls this year, for there are many who have never had the advantage of club work. The girls' exhibits are on display upstairs. There are no boys' ex - hibits. The clothing and girls' room exhibits are specially good. All of these things went to Chicago, and some of them brought home blue ribbons. The complete outfit for the girls' style show is here. The cotton school dress, children's garments, little boys' suit and little girls' dress are also here. Exhibits came from every side and section of the state. This shows there is a good representation. Just the things that went to Chicago are on display. Will you look over the things and see the type of work the 4-H club workers are doing? Jessie Greene: The 4-H club Ball Company canning contest exhibits are also in the case east of the other canning exhibit. The ten entries of the 4-H girls are here. The names of the counties will be placed on the jars so you can see what counties are represented. On the other side of the case is the 4-H canning exhibit which was sent to Chicago. The jars look very well to have had a trip to Chicago and back. Two blue ribbon entries are there. The five-jar exhibit of fruits and the five - jar exhibit of vegetables were in the blue ribbon group. Some of the jars also took white ribbons. </seg>
            <seg id="p371">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION DYEING FOB ROOM IMPROVEMENT 4-H Girls' Room Team Demonstration DOROTHY AND PAULINE KEMPCKE Good afternoon, folks! We've been dyeing for room improvement and we will now show you some of the tricks of using dye. We are members of the Cozy Corner Girls' Room Club of Elk City. 'This is my sister, Dorothy Kempcke, and I am Pauline. We have just completed our sixth year in club work and our leaders are Mrs. Byrel Morris and Miss Bernice Abraham, both of Elk City. Last year we began improving our room. We chose cream and cherry for a color scheme, so we plalnted the floor a deep shade of red, the woodwork cream, reflnished the furniture with walnut-stained varnish, and selected this wall-paper for the walls. We wanted organdy bows of a deep shade of cherry for our cream colored curtains. If you have ever tried to buy organdy in dark shades, you will know what we encountered when we tried to get some dark enough. Then ■dye came to our rescue. Why not purchase white organdy and dye it the desired shade? Then to match colors for other articles, it was necessary to dye other materials. So today we are going to show you the three methods of dyeing that we used in improving our room. They are boiling, tinting, and salt water boiling. Boiling a dye in material makes the color a permanent one, and we will demonstrate that method first. Tinting and salt water boiling will then follow. First dissolve the dye in a little hot water. Then wet the ma - terial thoroughly so that it will take the dye evenly. If it is soiled, it should be washed before you attempt to dye it. Fill a pan with enough hot water to cover the material without crowding it. Then strain the dissolved dye through a cloth to prevent streaks. Put in the dampened material and stir through the dye solution until it begins to boil. Any container that is large enough to hold enough water and is not galvanized may be used for dyeing. Galvanized vessels sometimes rust and in this way spot the materials. Then, too, chemicals used in galvanized vessels sometimes affect the color of the dye. This has started to boil now, so I'll add salt to it to set the color. For one gallon of water use two tablespoons of salt. In the small amount of water we are using, we need less salt. Never use iodized salt, as it rusts and discolors the material. Continue boiling for twenty minutes, stirring it the entire length of time. By keeping the material moving, it will not become streaked. Time will not permit me to boil this that long so we have here a piece of burlap that has been boiled for twenty minutes, and I will now rinse it. Then I will lift the material out of the hot dye bath into a pan containing </seg>
            <seg id="p372">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE clear, cold water and rinse It thoroughly. This water Is colored, so I'll rinse the material again to prevent the color from running. If the second rinse water is colored, rinse it again. When the water runs off clear, wrap the material in a towel to partially dry. Never hang it in the sun to dry, as it will dry streaked. Then iron it on the wrong side while it is still damp. This helps to set the color. Sum - marizing the reasons for streaked results we have: Insufficient amount of water, Dye not thoroughly dissolved and strained, Failure to keep the material moving, Not rinsing in cold water until the water runs oft clear, and Hanging it in the sun to dry. This is how the finished product looks. Dorothy will now tell you about greying and mixing colors. When Pauline made her hooked rug she wanted a border of reddish brown for it, so she mixed a small amount of red dye with the brown dye. I am going to show you how she mixed the colors for it. We have already dissolved and strained our dyes and have put them in these jars. A small amount of red dye is mixed with the brown dye and is added to the hot water. Then we take a piece of material and test it to be sure we have the correct shade. Notice that this piece of material is wet so that it will take the color evenly. One must re - member that material always appears darker when it is wet. Boiling a piece of material in the dye bath makes it darker, so a person would naturally expect the test material to be lighter than it would be when completed. I find that this is not quite dark enough, so I'll add more brown dye. When mixing colors, one cannot expect to have perfect results the first time. Here is the piece of material I dyed reddish brown. It is not always necessary to use color remover to change a color. For instance, blue and yellow make green. This chart shows how we changed a piece of blue material to green by boiling it in a yellow dye bath. If a yellow-green color is desired, one would use more yellow dye in the dye bath than one would if a blue-green color is desired. Red and blue make violet. Pink is a lighter shade of red, so I am going to change this piece of pink material to lavender by dipping it in a blue dye bath. Pink is a delicate shade and requires very little dye. If one grows tired of this year's pink dress, it may be changed to lavender for next year's wear. Or it may be changed to peach by boiling in a yellow dye bath. In some instances, you may feel that a color in its natural shade is too bright. You may tone it down to a certain extent by greying it. To grey a color add the compliment of a color, which is the color </seg>
            <seg id="p373">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION' ■opposite it on the color wheel. For instance, the compliment of violet is yellow. Here is a piece of violet material that we greyed by boiling it in a yellow dye bath. The compliment of red is green. Notice how we dulled a bright shade of red by boiling it in a green dye bath. I am going to take this piece of bright red material and grey it by dipping it in a green dye bath. Here is the piece of red material I greyed. Other colors may be greyed by this same method. Pauline will now tell you about tinting. When we purchased the voile for our curtains, we felt that it was not as creamy a shade as we wanted it to be to harmonize with our wallpaper and to produce a sunny effect in our northeast room. We remedied this by tinting it with yellow-colored dye. For fourteen yards of material we used one-fourth cake of yellow-colored dye. The material is prepared for tinting just as it is for dyeing. Put the dis - solved dye in the hot water and then stir the dampened material in it until it is a shade darker than desired because all colors appear darker when wet. The dye bath need not boil for tinting. Then rinse in clear, cold water until the water runs off clear. Roll up in a towel and iron on the wrong side while still damp. After we have laundered our curtains several times more, we will probably notice that they are beginning to get paler in color. When they do, we can retint them by this same method at the same time that we launder them, only a smaller amount of dye will be necessary the second time. Why not tint faded lingerie by this same method and make it look like new? Since it requires no boiling, it does not harm silk and it only takes a short time. Dorothy will now tell you how we made our dresser scarf and table cover fast color by boiling them in salt water. When we made our dresser scarf and table cover, we wanted them to be the same shade as our curtains so we tinted them that same shade by the method that Pauline has just explained. Dresser scarfs and table covers need laundering more often than curtains do, so they really should be fast dyed. But we thought if we boiled the material in the dye bath, it would be too dark or wouldn't match. So the safest way seemed to be to tint the material first and then make it fast color. I am going to take this piece of material Pauline has tinted and make it fast color by boiling it in salt water. Always use two tablespoons of . salt to one gallon of water to set the color. Again we caution you against the use of iodized salt. One must be sure to keep the material moving the entire twenty minutes that it is boiling. Since our time is limited, I cannot complete the boiling of this piece of material. This is our table cover that we made fast color by this method. It was formerly pure white. This concludes our demonstration on the three methods of dyeing: </seg>
            <seg id="p374">REPOUT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 1. Boiling, as we did in the tiebacks to our curtains and as we did in our rugs. 2. Tinting, as we did in our curtains. 3. Salt water boiling, as we did in our table cover. We hope that we have made everything about dyeing clear to you, but perhaps we haven't, so if there are any questions, we will do our best to answer them. Mrs. Overton then introduced Mrs. Roy L. Cochran, the wife of the Governor of Nebraska. "Mrs. Cochran has been interested for a long time in furthering the library facilities of the rural people. Last year a law was passed providing for funds with which to start. Mrs. Cochran will explain the plan that has been formulated to do this." THE NEBRASKA LIBRARY SITUATION MRS. ROY L. COCHRAN Horace Mann has said, "Good books are to the young what the warming sun and refreshing rain of spring are to the seeds which have lain dormant in the frosts of winter." It is a matter of practical wisdom for the state to recognize the fact that it owes more than an elementary education to its boys and girls. If during the child's life in the elementary school, he has access to a library and is taught how to use the books from that library, it is possible for him to continue his education by his own efforts, even though further formal schooling is denied him. jgr - -j j£^_ ,4, A REGIONAL ffTBjl^^^k Every year hundreds of boys and girls are graduated from thn state normal schools and the state university, as well as from other colleges. ' During their high school and college years they have been taught to work with books as their tools. After their graduation they </seg>
            <seg id="p375">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION go back to their community and usually find very few tools with which to work. But less than 15 per cent of our young people ever go to college. Many are even denied the privilege of a high school education. With a well developed state library system which cooperates closely with the rural schools, the boys and girls can be so trained to use library books that the 85 per cent who are denied the opportunity of a higher education can still, by their own efforts, obtain a good education. Continued access to library books provides the best means in the world for adults education and for wise use of leisure time. We recognize now that education is not a process which is com - pleted in youth, but a continuous process which is never finished. Adult education is a potent force in the development of family, com - munity, and state. It means higher education for adults at home and throughout their lives. It will be made possible for all with the public library as the great central agent around which schools, study clubs, reading circles, extension teaching, museums, and individual readers must cluster. In Governor's Cochran's budget message to the legislature, he said, "In considering the responsibilities of this state as to matters of educa - tion, I believe that we should give consideration to education in a broad sense, keeping in mind educational service to all of our citizens and not limit these advantages to those who may avail themselves of a higher education. It is with this thought in mind that I recom - mend appropriations for vocational education and the Nebraska Public Library Commission. In connection with the Nebraska Public Library Commission, I recommend the passage of pending legislation which will amend the present library law and make more effective its pro - visions. In case these recommendations are carried out, it is hoped and expected that this will lay a foundation for expanding the library service so that all rural communities may eventually be served." "Education in a broad sense" suggests that this opportunity for developing the power of thought and acquiring useful knowledge as well as the pleasure of reading be made accessible to the average person by means of adequate public library service. The boy or girl who cannot afford to go to high school or college and the men and women who thirst for knowledge should be encouraged and directed by librarians who are trained for that work. Thirty-four years ago the Nebraska Library Commission was estab - lished. It was the duty of this Commission to aid in the establish - ment of libraries in the state, send out boxes of books to schools, clubs, and individuals who requested the same, and to stimulate, in every way possible, the interest of the people in state and library work. The Commission is composed of five members, four of whom are ex-offlcio. </seg>
            <seg id="p376">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Two years ago the legislature discontinued the former Library Commission and placed the library under the supervision of the uni - versity librarian, and called it the Nebraska Public Library. Such a small appropriation was made for its maintenance that the work was badly curtailed. The fiftieth session of the Nebraska legislature passed a law, Senate File No. 272, which provides for the re-establishment of a Library Commission, but with this difference: the new Commission has no ex-offlcio members. It is a non-partisan Commission of five members, representing the Congressional districts of the state. These members, appointed by the governor, will in the future serve five-year terms without pay. One new member is appointed each year. The first duty of the new Commission is the selection of a well - qualified executive secretary, for a four-year term. Only an experi - enced, trained librarian can qualify for this position. The first official action taken by the new Library Commission upon its organization was to re-appoint Miss Nellie Carey who has in the past so well and faithfully served the Nebraska Library Commission. The experience of the past has given Miss Carey a thorough knowledge of the library conditions of the state and makes her invaluable in any plan for more extensive service. In the meantime her re-appointment assures the continuation of the library service which has been given in the past as the broader service of the future is gradually developed. The other duties of the Commission are as follows: 1. To give as much library service throughout the state as possible with the funds available. 2. To supplement the book needs in libraries already established. 3. To supply library service for the rural schools of the state. 4. To promote adult education. 5. To plan, encourage, and assist in the formation of county and regional libraries and to develop graually, in the state capitol, a non - fiction reference library which will be at the service of every person living in the state of Nebraska. The law provides that provision be made for the Nebraska Public Library Commission in the Capitol. These rooms should be ready to be occupied by the first of the year. The quarters which Miss Carey now occupies in the basement of the Social Science Hall are entirely inadequate to house a state library. The companion bill, Senate File No. 273, is an enabling act which permits the citizens of a county, if they so desire, after due notice has been given in the newspapers, to establish county or regional libraries, provided the county board has been authorized to do so by a vote of </seg>
            <seg id="p377">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION the majority of the electors of any county voting upon the subject at a general election. The county board will comprise the library board of any county voting for county library service. If several counties go together to form a regional library, one member from each county board will compose the library board for the regional library. The county or regional library board may determine the location of the library in some centrally located town or county seat. Any established town library which so desires may become a part of the county or regional system. The town library board need only make a request to county or regional board to be included in the county or regional library district and pay the same levy for library purposes as the larger unit. If the town library board wishes for any reason to withdraw from the county or regional system they may do so by notifying the county or regional library board. If they choose to withdraw or if they stay out in the first place, they are taxed only for their local library and not for the larger system. This law further provides that county or regional libraries can disestablish in the same manner in which they are established. Nebraska contains 77,520 square miles. It is about fifteenth in size out of the forty-eight states in the union. It is twenty-five per cent larger than all the New England states put together, and there are six counties in Nebraska which are larger than the state of Rhode Island. County libraries are today in operation in about two hundred coun - ties in the United States. Even in far-off Hawaii we find a county library service modeled largely upon the California system, and the idea of library service has also been transplanted from California to Great Britain where it is being developed with great zeal. The earliest county library legislation, as has been previously stated, ap - peared in Indiana in 1816, at the time of the adoption of the state constitution. But the great bulk of the county library legislation in our country has been passed within the last decade, since the California county library service has attracted the attention of the library world. To develop a system which will bring library service to all of the people in rural Nebraska will require some pioneering work. Cali - fornia now has a very successful county system and some of the eastern states give very good library service. In fact it is said that the United States leads the world in the development of library service. Our problem in Nebraska is to take the best from the already estab - lished library systems and adopt the same with necessary changes and innovations to the conditions in our state. </seg>
            <seg id="p378">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE But here in the very center of the United States, in the heart of the Great Plains region, we have vast areas of land with low assessed valuations, and in most areas scattered population. In this state dur - ing the last two decades, while our population as a whole has in - creased only 5 per cent, the population of our state institutions has increased 70 per cent. Why not spend a small part of our tax money on an intelligent pro - gram of health and recreational activities of which the library is the cornerstone and keep our youth healthy-minded and out of trouble? Is it not more economical and better for Nebraska to help provide for constructive use of leisure time than to build more institutions? Present day conditions give the promise of more leisure time for the average person. Let us make a state library system the cornerstone of an intelligent health and recreational program which will keep our young people healthy-minded and busy. It will be cheaper as well as better for Nebraska to provide con - structive use of leisure time than to put up more buildings at our state institutions to house a rapidly increasing number who have become "a menace to society." The American Library Association says the Federation of Women's Clubs have assisted in establishing more than seventy-five per cent of all the public libraries in the United States. Here in Nebraska the majority of the libraries have been established by club women, and were maintained by the efforts of the club women until they became tax supported. At the present time there are 174 tax supported libraries in Nebraska, with 108 which are still supported by the club women. There are only three counties in the state without local library service. Many of the libraries are small and are having a struggle for existence, but the fact that there are so many libraries scattered over the state shows that the people of Nebraska are library conscious. It is not strange that Nebraska appreciates and wants libraries, as our state ranks second, if not first, of all the states in the union in literacy. We have only four-tenths of one per cent of illiteracy. Ninety per cent of the people in Nebraska are native born. There are only eight and thirty-seven hundredths per cent of our population who are foreign and less than five per cent who are unnaturalized. The average Nebraskan is an intelligent person, but fifty per cent of the people in the state are without local library service. The establishment of 282 libraries which now exist in Nebraska has been encouraged and helped every step of the way by the Ne - braska Library Commission. Because of the lack of knowledge of this work on the part of the public, this department has never received much publicity, and I presume there are people here today who do </seg>
            <seg id="p379">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION not know of the existence of the Nebraska Library Commission. This Commission selected librarians who were able men and women. By dint of hard work and handicapped by small appropriations, they have done a splendid piece of work in promoting library service in the state. J. " i L j j..i i ii7ij9M:iln 40 f ' ■!

At the present time, any school, clubs or individuals who desire books can get the same by writing to her, in care of the Nebraska Library Commission, State Capitol Building, Lincoln. If she has the book or books in the library, she will be very glad to send them providing the applicant pays the transportation charges. Because of the limited appropriation for this work, the service at the present time must necessarily be limited, but she will do the best she can to take care of your book needs. "Economic conditions during the past two years have made more people turn to libraries for information, inspiration, and recreation, so that, notwithstanding a reduced personal and a reduced budget, the Nebraska Public Library faced a constant demand for more and more book-service from the people of the state whose own communities found it impossible to supply their needs. New types of requests came: CCC camps and transient centers needed books for study and recreation; adult education centers, night classes, and vacation study clubs were added to the groups to be served." Let us develop in this state a system which will make more effec - tive use of our existing library resources and broaden this service until it is so widespread that books are circulated into communities which have never before had the advantages of any sort of library service. Every exisiting library in the state could be immeasurably strengthened and helped by this plan. </seg>
            <seg id="p380">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Nebraska is primarily an agricultural state. The census office la Washington, D. C. considers any municipality having a population of over 2,500 an urban population and any town less than 2,500 as rural population. In Nebraska there are 513 incorporated villages, towns and cities,' and of this number only twenty-nine cities are urban centers. Nebraska has a population of 1,300,000, of which 450,000 are the people living in the urban centers. The rest of the state's population, 850,000, which is about twice as many as the people living In the city, represent our rural population. 1 """; "I— rjnri ' n^^fr^# N EBRASK A | ' *,-l— Jk— J I «l distribution or MumoPAuTits j 1 \ HAVING POPULATION I £ • __ _ | I • L Of 2SOO WO UrtR | A H =*V »«"««&lt;■ »»«"«. • • • I I m \ Seventy-eight per cent of the purchasing power of the people in the state of Nebraska belong to the people who are directly connected with agriculture. Nebraska has 7,212 school districts in the state and 6,068 one-room rural schools. The property of the rural schools has an assessed valuation of $11,700,000, and they have a bonded in - debtedness of $550,000. The assessed valuation of the property of the town schools of the state amounts to $40,000,000 and they have a bonded indebtedness of nearly $30,000,000. This means that at the average rate of 4 per cent, the people In the towns of Nebraska are paying over $1,200,000 in interest in school bonds. If the school districts can, in the future, finance themselves on the pay-as-you-go plan, the same as the state does, it is possible to have better schools and an adequate library system without raising the taxes. The sum of $1,200,000, which is at the present time spent for interest, would go a long way toward improving our schools as well as help maintain a system which will furnish books for everyone. The density of population in Nebraska varies from 704 people per square mile in Douglas county to 2 per square mile in Sioux, Cherry, and several other sandhill counties. Two-thirds of the population in Nebraska is found in the eastern third of the state. The average pop - ulation per square mile in Nebraska is 17. This would require a great </seg>
            <seg id="p381">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION shift of population from the one-third of the state which, holds the two - thirds of the population to have our population evenly distributed. Some of these sandhill counties have such low assessed valuations that they are financially unable to provide adequate library service. We have other counties containing rich valley land. For efficient and economic, state-wide library service, you can see that some plan will have to be devised which will provide books for the people living in the sparsely populated counties as well as for those living in the thickly populated counties. In many of the counties, the assessed valuation would not be large enough to maintain a county library system, even though the people desired it. Twenty-five years ago, a man named Gillis was appointed State Librarian of California. He was an able man who had a vision of real library service to the people. His early life was spent where there was a dearth of books. He was a business man with a broad vision and ideals of service. When he became librarian of the State Library, he at once set about to make the California library a library of service to the people who maintained it. A state traveling library system was inaugurated, but this did not solve the question of bringing books to all the people, as Mr. James Gillis wished to see it solved. Laws were passed, then changed and improved until now California has developed a county library system which is outstanding in the library world. I wish to quote the following from Miss Long's , book on Count y Library Service: "The service offered by the county libraries in Cali - fornia so impressed one eastern visitor, who had viewed the wonders of the Yosemite, the grandeurs of the Kings River canyon and the mysteries of the desert, that after a trip through several counties in which he had seen county library branches and stations scattered everywhere in remote mountains and in the lonely cabins in the desert, he remarked: 'Men, I tried for years in an eastern city to get the library to place a branch in a thickly populated section of the town without results. I come out here and find your county libraries placing branches everywhere that people can use them, even out in the wilds. They say that California's scenery is wonderful — I think you have something here even more wonderful than your scenery.' " The big change and improvement in our manner and means of transportation makes possible now a type of library service which would have been impossible a few years ago. Our roads are greatly improved. Almost every family owns a car. Even in the remote sand - hill counties, the automobile is the universal means of transportation. Even the smallest a"nd poorest sandhill county has at least 400 auto - mobiles. There is plenty of money for automobiles; so why not for books? </seg>

There are 400,000 motor cars for these 343,000 families, making an average of one and seven - tenths car for each family. Nebraska has 95,000 miles of road, or nearly enough to circle the globe four times. Of this 7,715 miles are paved or graveled highway. The number of automobiles in Nebraska makes possible the develop - ment of a library system at the present time which would have been impossible ten years ago. Professor Senning of the University of Nebraska who helped the members of the last legislature redistrict the state for the one-house legislature worked with two engineers upon this plan of six big regional library districts. They took into consideration railroad and traffic flow centers. The Library Commission is not sure that six regional library districts are the right number for Nebraska. Some of these districts may be too large and some counties may not wish to be included in a regional district. This is only a tentative plan which was developed because of the need of some sort of definite goal. Comprehensive library service to the rural and small town schools should be the .aim of our regional and county library system. This should be a specialized service to meet the requirements of the school manual. In some places this includes many supplementary textbooks to add interest and information in reading, history, geography, and other required subjects; reference books adap'ted to children in ele - mentary grades, home reading prescribed by some competent auth - ority, magazines, pictures, maps, globes, charts, and frequently stereo - graphs and music records. You can have this service for our schools in Nebraska if you want it badly enough to work for it. </seg>
            <seg id="p383">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION NEBRASKA \i/ V fUW.IC LIBftARV COMMISSION DtVClOPtDINTOACENTRAL *V PCrtPCNCC UBOAI&gt;-&lt; \ Adequate library service depends upon two things — trained - librarians and a big collection of books and magazines which are kept in constant circulation. In establishing a library system, the money should be spent upon these two important factors rather than upon library buildings. When the library service is well established, the buildings can come later. j The most efficient and economical sort of library service is one where the collection of books is fluid — that means constantly changed from one library to another until they are worn out from actual service instead of gathering dust on the shelves of the library after outliving its usefulness in one particular community. Miss Harriette Long, a former Nebraska girl who is State Librarian of Oregon says, "To many people, the word library implies a beautiful building with little thought of the books therein or their usefulness. This idea must be dispelled. A county library is primarily a system of book service, which places books in all parts of the county, where they invite use, and is most emphatically not a collection of books centrally housed, and used only by those who chance to come and get them. A county free library service seeks out the people, learns their tastes and their aspirations and takes books to them in such numbers and of such kind as are indicated by the requests from the community. From the headquarters which are usually established at the county seat, the books when purchased, accessioned, cataloged and prepared for circulation pour out into all parts of the county, wherever they are needed. The aim Is not to build up a large collection at one central spot within the county, but rather to place the books within easy reach of the people. To accomplish this, library service stations are established in the county wherever a group of residents wishes one. The community </seg>
            <seg id="p384">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE needs to determine the cbarcater of the service station. For the larger communities a branch with a well-equipped reading room is estab - lished. For the smaller villages and crossroad stations a collection of books is placed in a store, postoffice, or some other place convenient to everyone. Sometimes home libraries are established in a far-off part of the county where a group of neighbor families shares a collec - tion of books. These distributing points are in charge of some local person who works for some compensation under the general direction of the able and experienced county librarian. The county librarian plans and administers the whole. Through frequent visits to these service points a personal relation between the county librarian and each community is established resulting in real understanding of the needs and possibilities for service. The local agent is in every case the con - necting link between headquarters and the service station, and through his or her enthusiasm and sympathy can do much to make the library the living heart of the community. The book collection at each of these points is a constantly shifting one, and is ;at all times regarded as but a sample of the books the county library offers. The alert custodian makes note of the wish of any patron for a book and eagerly transmits that request to head - quarters so that return mail may see the wish gratified. It is the opportunity to browse among books, selecting at will the books which fill the particular need of the moment, which the county library system offers through its network of branches and stations, some one of which is convenient to everyone in the county. It is, furthermore, the realization that each borrower may request and receive from headquarters the special books he needs, that his choice is not limited to the few books which serve as samples on the shelves, that means much to the book-hungry rural residents. That a book may be sent by mail or an answer to some troublesome question given over the telephone to any county resident, is a service which the county or regional library makes possible. The boys and girls grow - ing up have access to the world of books. The man or woman who wishes opportunity to carry on the education which was abruptly terminated with the seventh or eighth grade finds the county library with its splendid book service a tool ready at hand. For study or for recreation the county library brings to each person in the county an opportunity to get the particular books needed at the time of need. Whether we have county libraries or regional libraries in this state, the method and the system will be the same. The area should be large enough to support a library with a reasonable levy, but small enough to make the personal contacts necessary for good library service. This will require the active cooperation of librarians, library trustees, school authorities, town county boards, and organized groups such as </seg>
            <seg id="p385">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION the P.-T. A., N. E. A., women's clubs and men's organizations. Only by actual experience .can we determine the size of the unit which is large enough for economical library service and yet not too large for an intimate, contact with the people, which is necessary for efficient library service. The method of distribution will be from the central or administra - tive headquarters at some county seat or large town out to the branch libraries and book Btations which may be located in school houses, stores, town halls, postof flees, \ garages, barber shops, or residences, or wherever numbers of people can easily reach them. The parcel post will be used largely in sending out the daily requests for books which are made by phone and mail, and a book truck utilized to change the larger collections of books in the branches and stations. People or groups of people who are interested in library service will not have to build libraries or rent buildings and can spend its money on books and service. The books and magazines will be sent out in varying numbers to branches and stations and part or all of the books will be changed at frequent intervals from one point to another in the way which will serve the greatest number of readers. Two things are necessary for adequate library service. We must have books of all kinds and many of them, but these books must be wisely selected and widely circulated. A wide circulation is as essential as books in a properly functioning library system. It is a mistake to suppose that collections of books, however choice their selection has been, can be live factors in eduction without circulation. Locomotives and automobiles are magnificent creations, but unless manipulated with brains as well as brawn, they are of no more use than a heap of scrap iron. The right book must reach the person who needs it as well as the one who wants it, if the library is to act as an educational leaven. Trained librarians must plan for the administration and constant circulation of library books. It is to be hoped, as the regional system are gradually developed, that the State Library Commission will eventually grow into a reference library to furnish to the regional libraries upon request the non-fiction and reference works which are more expensive and less frequently used. In this way it will be possible to develop a state-wide library system which will place within the reach of everyone any book they may desire, no matter how expensive or unusual it may be.

            <seg id="p386">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE under the leadership and inspiration of the staffs of the regional librarian and the Library Commission. In closing the following brief summary of the accomplishments of the past year in the promotion of library service for Nebraska is aa follows : Adequate library legislation has been passed. A new library commission was established. A grant of nearly $4,000 has been obtained from the federal gov - ernment to equip rooms in the Capitol for the Nebraska Library Com - mission. They are working on this project now. Miss Nellie Carey was appointed to head the Nebraska Library Commission for the next four years. Preliminary work has been done to obtain a gift of a book mobile for the Nebraska Library Commission. Plans are being laid for the development of a definite long range plan of library service. If the leaders in the various counties of the state give this work their support, it will be possible to develop here in Nebraska a library system which is second only to our public school system in educational value. -■'..' WE AND PEACE REV. LEONARD STROMBERG Many are the great problems which have interested humanity in all times. Some of them have been solved in one way or another, but there are still some which seem as nearly insolvable today as they have always been. There will always be problems for mankind to face, because as soon as one is solved, another will show up, and we will work just as hard with it as with any of the former ones. Some of " the old problems which ought to be solved at any time are giving us much to think about. Take for instance the problem of our daily bread. This is as old as humanity itself. We have tried to solve it, are trying today and will keep on trying, and we hope that some day the solution may be found. Nearly all of us work and earn our daily bread, and some have been lucky enough to gather in for themselves altogether too much and live in luxury and ease, when others have so little that it is a ques - tion from day to day what to sustain their life on. Just the other </seg>
            <seg id="p387">NEBRASKA HOME KCOXOMICS ASSOCIATION day I read in some paper about a family, so poor that they did not even have a little coal for Christmas, and a baby froze to death in that cold home, when all around people had heat and food and every - thing they could wish for to make the holiday happy and bright. As long as such things exist we have not solved that problem of daily bread. We have the problem of health, if I may call it so. Ever since Illness beset humanity, there have been persons trying to find a cure for this or that ailment, but even if the medical men and surgeons have succeeded wonderfully, there are still many problems unsolved. We have learned much about the human body and its ailments and in. many ways how to fight illness successfully, but with all scientific re - search and all human thinking employed, we have not yet been able to - find a cure for all sickness. Probably this problem will never be solved,, for it seems as if new ailments appear nearly as fast as cures are found for old ones. There are many other problems which could be mentioned illustra - tively, but we will turn to the one before us, the problem of peace. As a fundamental question on the subject we could ask this: Is it possible for humanity to achieve and keep a lasting peace throughout the whole world? Only thinking of it and discussing it might bring us into some heated argument — and there is no peace. Nearly all of us hate war; we do not even like to think of it. And still, the news in which people today are most interested is the news of the Ethiopian war, and the very dangerous situation in Europe at present. However peaceful our mind may be, when it comes to the question of war, feelings are easily stirred up, and people are taking sides, as we did in the great World war some years ago. War is one of the greatest calamities in the world. Fear and selfish - ness started it; fear and selfishness are keeping it up. In the pre - historic times self-protection probably had much to do with it. Man had to protect himself from wild beasts, and, as"7Tiate- ran on. from beastly men, or perish. In the olden times men glorieS in war (some people do so yet) and educated the young men for itl A wrong con - ception of life and its meaning not only made it possible to see a cer - tain glory in war, but also made it the greatest honor to be a soldier. When you study ancient history, most of it is a history of great wars, and even when you get down to modern times, the niost important part of it seems to be the history of the great wars, the biography of great warriors, successful generals, who have been able to kill, destroy others, gaining some selfish objects for themselves. We have not yet outgrown the barbarism of ancient times, have not risen above their false ideals, and humanity suffers for it. We might be awakening just now. Some signs seem to indicate it, but we are yet far from being </seg>
            <seg id="p388">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE UOARD OF AGRICULTURE wide awake In this respect. Still our hope is that humanity as a whole shall truly wake up and be able to see the futility, the foolishness of war: As long as selfish ambition and the dishonest wish to acquire by armed force that which does not belong to us is prevalent, there will be danger of war at any time; and as long as confidence is lacking be - tween nations and distrust and hatred prevails, men will go to war. And as long as the present state of mind is kept alive, nations will pre - pare for war, not counting the cost. &lt;Great peace movements have been started time and again and 'especially during the last decades, but none of them has brought the desired results. They do show, however, an awakening to a better understanding among people. The reason for their failure might lie in the fact that they have not required enough. A peace movement :that does not include real disarmament is not enough for the world. Such a disarmament does not mean that a country should be altogether -without means to take care of eventualities within its own borders, but it should require that no armies, navies or air fleets should exist for -war with other nations. As long as the world is arming, there might "be a war at any time. But were there no means of war, it would be possible to settle disturbing questions peacefully before any nation were ready to strike. Several disarmament conferences have been held, and there is one in session in England just now, but to no avail. It seems to be navies the nations are especially concerned about, but after each such con - ference, the shipbuilding has been greater than ever, and larger and larger armaments required. It has not been so much the question of reducing armies and navies as the question of the right ratio between the nations. Each one of the great powers seems anxious to be the best prepared and have a little more than the rest of them. No, we repeat it, as long as the nations have no faith in each other, and as long as there is hate and selfishness and false ideals about war, we cannot abolish it, cannot look for lasting peace. The very fact of preparations for war bears in itself the seed of new wars. What position then, ought we to take to this tremendous question? We are a peace-loving nation a great number of our citizens declare positively against all wars, and the pactifists are not few. Should we, then, as a peaceful and peace-loving nation disarm to show the world what we want and what our convictions are? For my own personal part, I hate war, and I think it is the greatest crime on earth, and I would protest to the uttermost, were we to go to war again, and ■especially if we were the aggressors. I would with all my power preach Against an aggressive war. But at the same time I am aware of the fact </seg>
            <seg id="p389">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION' that Jf we were attacked by any foreign power and our country were in danger, if an enemy came trying to destroy it and our homes and families, I would be more than willing to go and fight, even to death, to protect all that which is dear to me. And as I feel in this respect, 1 am convinced every true citizen feels, whatever they may call them - selves and whatever their convictions. And still we would love peace and believe in it. Our pacifist friends have often suggested that we disarm, thereby to show the world the right way to peace. Of course that would be one of the greatest gestures in that direction that could be shown, but the question would be as to the practicability and wisdom of such a move under present conditions. This great nation alone, without any means of protection, when all the world is armed and ready to strike at any moment would be an easy prey for others. It would be the height of foolishness for us to take such a step. If we could depend on the friendlness of the other nations, or if the rest of the world would disarm at the same time, there would be nothing against the proposition, but as it is, we must have some preparations for defend - ing ourselves. There is a grea. Movement for peace among the students In colleges - and high schools jusi low. The last month of 1935 saw several very great conferences of such students, one in Columbus, Ohio, and one in Kansas City, Missouri, where the questions of war and peace were discussed. The students were required to take an oath not to take part in any way in which our country may become involved, even If. it be a defensive war. Naturally this met with opposition from some of. the students, but many took the oath, probably not thinking of what It meant. Making the country perfectly defenseless would be a terrible crime. The attitude of the students who took the oath was far from right and in. no way patriotic. To protect one's country, one's home and family is a holy duty, and only a coward would refuse to do it. But when it comes to aggressive war, the students are right, because we. should never start a war with any enemy. What should we do, then, to keep peace and to establish peace among - the nations? First of all, let our nation take its stand, as it has, for peaceful negotiations in all international questions, trying to pacify all con - cerned. It may not bring all the results wished for, but it will help in a way. Then, when new peace conferences and disarmament conferences are held, let us send such representatives as will diligently work for a decrease in armaments and for settling troublesome questions by arbitration. As it has been in the past, we have sent militarists to </seg>
            <seg id="p390">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE speak for us, and the influence of the great armaments and munition - making corporations has been strongly felt. It is not for finding a right competitive basis for armaments that those conferences are held, but to find a way of disarming the world and making war more im - possible than it is. Then let us inaugurate a new system of teaching our young people, by setting up before them ideals of peace instead of ideals of war. "We must admit that we have glorified war and war heroes too much in the past, and if the growing generation shall be able to see things from the standpoint of peace, it must be taught to do so. If the young people are educated to see the beauty of peace and the horrors of war, they will also be able to do great things for peace. The communistic propaganda in the world is in nowise healthy for the peace among people. The preaching of revolution, the working on the masses for a bloody overthrow of present governments and the present systems and the taking over of government by the proletariat do not help to drive the danger of war from us, rather the other way. We should not allow the communist propaganda to go on in our country, as it is doing. Even if our present system is far from perfect, and if there are ever so many opportunities for something better, that better - ment should be done in such a way that peace and happiness among the people could keep on undisturbed. But to obtain lasting peace within a country and between nations takes something more than the things I have mentioned. There is, according to my own humble opinion, only one sure way in which to reach it, and that is by accepting the ideals of Jesus Christ, the ideals of love for God and man. When the majority of the human family has accepted that love and commenced to live it, then it will also be possible to have peace in the world. When I say the ideals of Christ and His love, I do not mean Christianity as it appears to us today, because the Christian church as such has failed sorely. Had the Christian, or as they are called Christian, countries really had Christ's ideals and love, the great World war would have been an impossibility, and the present war going on in Ethiopia, would never have started. Still we shall not give up hope for a better day to come, when Christianity shall not be only a confession for many, but real life for all, and then lasting peace will be possible. If we, who can comprehend this today, will start out living Christ, others will follow, and even if it takes a long time, eventually we will reach our goal, and peace shall be ours. </seg>
            <seg id="p391">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION TUESDAY AFTERNOON MISS MARGARET FEDDE, Presiding Marionette Show A marionette show, Nutcracker Suite, was presented by Nevada and Geneva Wheeler. Margaret McGregor and Eudora Mallory fur - nished the music. Miss Fedde introduced each of the girls and told how this was a hobby of theirs. The Nutcracker Suite was the opera chosen, and all of the women were keenly interested. Following the show. Miss Wheeler showed the different kinds of dolls, how they were made and how they were manipulated. She also told the cost of the different dolls, which in most cases was very little or nothing at all, since the clothes were made of scraps of cloth, fur, lace, or crepe paper. After the show, Miss Fedde turned the meeting over to Mary-Ellen Brown. Miss Brown asked the new county chairmen to take the chairs in the center front which had been reserved for them; then the old county chairmen were asked to sit at the right, and the county home demonstration agents and state specialists at the left of them. COUNTY CHAIRMEN RECOGNITION MARY-ELLEN BROWN Before presenting the new county chairmen of the project clubs to Director Brokaw, may I add my bit of appreciation for the work which you have done and will continue to do in the future. We are always glad, Director Brokaw, when you come to take part in the program to say "Thank you" to these women who have carried on project work, because it is this valuable leadership of the past which is making possible the thing which is happening in Nebraska. This year we are having project work not in forty-six counties, but in eighty - one counties. That is what the new law has done for us. Let's make the most of it while we have it. This morning Mrs. Overton told you there were 19,505 women enrolled in project work last year. We must have more than 6,000 new members than we had last year at this time. We can't tell you what the exact number is today. So many enrollments are coming in every day that we can't keep up with them. Why do they come? Because you project leaders are doing such a fine piece of work. You are keeping people busy with something worth while to do, so there isn't time to find fault and gossip. I want to tell this group of new county chairmen who have never received the pins before, that we are not giving the pins at this time. </seg>

            <seg id="p393"/>
            <seg id="p394">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The committee in charge of the recognition felt it would be fine if we would have the pins presented at the Achievement Day in your own county when your own groups will be there, instead of presenting them at Organized Agriculture. So your pins are not going to be given to you this afternoon, but something else which you will cherish as much as your pin. I want to say to the new county chairmen that we knew they all couldn't be here, but we knew there would be a pretty good number of them here. At the end of this year, there will be 272 women who have received the little gold leadership pin at Organized Agriculture In Nebraska — 272 outstanding women. They are busy women, but we all know that it is the busy people who find time to do these extra worth while things which add to the joy of living. You have been busy in your homes, for you have had the food to buy and prepare for the family, you have kept the house clean and sanitary, you have pro - vided and cared for the clothing of the family, you have looked after the health of the members of the family and perhaps have even cared for sickness outside the home. These four jobs are big enough for anyone. Besides these, you have had gardening, canning, dairy, family relationship, child training, entertaining company and all sorts of things which have kept you as busy as can be. On top of all that, you have had time to give to those in your community. Many of you have been project leaders or president of your local clubs and because you did a fine piece of work in your local club, you were asked to take a bigger responsibility and probably many of you have been club chairmen and then were asked to become the county chairman. When you were project leaders you took time to attend the leaders' training meetings. Then you went home and studied the lesson and prepared the demonstration material. After this you gave of your time and thought and energy in presenting the demonstration to the local club. A good many of you have not only been project leaders, but you have been 4-H club leaders and you have had a part in Federated Women's Clubs, P.-T. A., Sunday school and other church activities. You have been giving of your time in many ways and in many places. There is no end of the things you have been able to do. You must be good managers to do all of these things. We are right in the age when we need leaders as we have never needed leaders before. If we are to have our government run sanely and if we are going to produce the best kind of family life, we are going to need leaders just like you to help us along the way. You have gone a long ways, but there is much ahead of you yet. We can't do the big job alone and we will need much help. It is a pleasure for me at this time to present to the Director, the one to whom we all look for direction in our work, those who are to receive the recognition for the first time. We wish the whole sixty - one could have been here. </seg>
            <seg id="p395">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION LEADERSHIP RECOGNITION DIRECTOR W. H. BROKAW This has been a disconcerting week, but there are some things which come Into one's life that add to the happiness and sunshine, and this is certainly one of those occasions. I think the past months, yes, two and one-half years, have been some of the most interesting years in my life. It has been a privilege to have known a leadership that has been developing through the years and what these leaders have been able to accomplish. It has been worth something to know the loyalty that one may have within his own service and to know, how well people have learned to do that thing which means most to all — an unselfish leadership in the interests of agriculture and the home. First, might I say that all of the members of the Extension Service have more than risen to the expectations that I might have had of them in the years of the past. It has been a trying time to all of us. It has also been trying to them. I have seen many of our fellow workers worn out and tired out mentally and physically,- almost down and out be - cause of the happenings in the past, yet with the courage to go on and still believing in their cause. The finest thing that has come has been the way in which these farm men and farm women have responded to the worst crisis we have ever known in agriculture the world over. If there has been anything worse or more trying, at least history does not tell it to us. Because of the great responsibility in doing these things, I have had but little time to work with the women's groups. But I have been looking forward to the week when the women have an oppor - tunity to meet together. Last week I had the privilege of meeting leaders from each county in the state of Nebraska, for no county failed to send less than seven leaders, and I wish there could have been more. This is a demonstra - tion of what working toward a common goal may mean. Eighteen years ago we could never have visioned such a group of people — people with such an earnest desire to do the things in the interest of their home and their community. But while all this has been going on, you folks have been carrying on those things essential within the home. For all the things which, have been worked out and all effort which has been put forth, has been done with but one thought in mind and that is that the home may give to the family and on-coming youth those things which will insure building foundations for a great nation. One of the pleasures that comes to me is meeting with the Master Farmers. Another joy in my life is knowing those women who are giving unselfishly of their leadership in home demonstration work. I have had the pleasure of seeing a great many of you during these years and knowing you, and of seeing your efforts culminate in some- </seg>
            <seg id="p396">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE thing worth while. It is gratifying to include the work in eighty-one counties rather than the few counties we had a few years ago. It is building soundly something which is of value. It is building the type of a trained leadership that will not result in failure. The greatest trial is when they see some of their efforts thwarted. There is no nervous temperament displayed in groups of this kind, so we are particularly proud of a group like this. And while the men have been carrying on the piece of work they have been doing and developing in this state, the greatest undertaking we have ever had, we are seeing new leaders among the women of the state and we hope with that sort of leadership to carry on in these months to come. It is going to be my privilege to read to this group the charge. Before doing so, I would like to read the names of the leaders. Mrs. Estey Ernest, Kenesaw* Mrs. T. M. Harrington, O'Neill Mrs. R. G.

            <seg id="p397">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION An Appreciation of Leadership Your friends and neighbors have chosen you county chairman of home demonstration project work. They believe you to possess that ability to serve and that spirit of self-sacrifice so necessary for success - ful leadership. By this choice there devolves upon you that duty of inspiring your fellow workers with a loyalty to service and a desire for achievement of those things in home making and home life that are necessary for better agriculture and more complete living on Nebraska farms. Your selection was an honor and privilege, but it also implied duties to perform and obligations to fill. Your regular duties have not prevented your meeting these tasks and we recognize that only busy people are successful leaders. By a faithful performance of your duties, you have inspired a con - fidence in you and a friendship for you that can only be secured by having been a friend to others and by a faithful performance of obliga - tions assumed. One is not worthily a leader who is not doing all in her power to enlighten her community by becoming, in so far aa humanly possible, an example of right living and service to others. While the work you have done and the goals achieved are highly -commendable, you have but entered into this field of leadership so essential to agriculture's welfare and to national progress. Others may assume in the coming years your tasks of the present, but leader - ship accomplishments imply growth of the individual and point the way to broader fields. Do not misunderstand, the leadership in any field though it may appear to have greater possibilities for accomplish - ments, is no more essential than the proper leadership in your own field. Your community, your county, your state, the nation, are observing the character of your service. They will expect much of you and in this we are sure they will not be disappointed for into the hearts of all humans there has been implanted, and it depends only upon proper cultivation for growth, that desire for leadership so essential to an occupation such as ours and to the welfare of a Christian nation. In reading to you the charge, it seems to me that it gives somewhat the thing which you exemplify and we are hoping that it is some inspiration to you to have this appreciation of leadership, because we recognize in you a potential leadership within the state and we do appreciate what you have given to Nebraska. It is now my privilege to hand to you a copy of this appreciation of leadership and we hope </seg>
            <seg id="p398">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE that it -will mean a great deal to you. Following this, Miss Brown introduced Miss Ella Donaldson, presi - dent of the Home Demonstration Agents' Organization. Miss Donald - son said: In behalf of the Home Demonstration Agents, I wish to express our sincere appreciation of the work that you as leaders are performing in your own counties. I think the spirit of leadership that you have entered into, and many of you have carried to completion, is well put in this wonderful poem, The Bridge Builder. May I read that for you now. An old man, going a lone highway, Came at the evening, cold and gray To a chasm, vast and deep and wide Through which was flowing a sullen tide. The old man crossed in the twilight dim, The sullen stream had no fears for him. But he turned, when safe on the other side, And built a bridge to span the tide. "Old man," said a fellow pilgrim near, "You are wasting strength with building here. Your journey will end with the ending day. You never again must pass this way. You have crossed the chasm, deep and wide. Why build you the bridge at the eventide?" The builder lifted his old gray head. "Good friend, in the path I have come," he said, "There followeth after me today. A youth whose feet must pass this way. This chasm that has been naught to me, To that fair-haired youth may a pitfall be He, too, must cross in the twilight dim. Good friend, I am building the bridge for him." — Will Allen Dromgoole So to you as leaders in your counties, we wish to present a token of appreciation for the efforts you have put forth in building the bridge of cooperation and we hope that your services will ever be a joy to you and to your respective counties. Miss Donaldson and Miss Stanek then presented each county chair - man with a red or white carnation. Miss Brown then asked the past county chairmen to stand, then the county home demonstration agents, state specialists, project leaders, presidents, group chairmen and 4-H club leaders. The rest of the </seg>
            <seg id="p399">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION audience then stood and everyone joined In singing "Follow the Gleam." Ceres Clnb Tea After the recognition the new chairmen were asked to form a re - ceiving line, headed by Miss Mary-Ellen Brown, Miss Margaret Fedde, Mrs. Roy L. Cochran, Mrs. E. A. Burnett, Mrs. W. W. Burr, and Mrs. W. H. Brokaw. The Ceres Club served tea following the reception. WEDNESDAY FORENOON MRS.- ERNEST OVERTON, Presiding Mrs. Overton opened this session by introducing Mrs. George Barney who talked on "Interpreting for the Deaf". Mrs. Barney's parents were both deaf, so she grew up helping them to hear and understand. She talked particularly about how one interprets for the deaf at funerals or at church. Mrs. Barney has attended Mothers' Vacation Camp and the women enjoyed her very much. Last September a group of Nebraska women attended the Rural Home Conference at Columbus, Ohio. The women enjoyed the meet - ings very much and received considerable inspiration and good from them. Miss Evelyn Wolph, one of the delegates, told about the trip and about some of the talks which were given at this meeting.

In 1326, under the leadership of the County Life Association, a email group of women, sixteen in number, from various sections of the United States, spent three days in Chicago, discussing the desires of farm women. Mrs. Nelson Berger of Nehawka, Cass county, was one of these women. Mrs. Berger was at that time president of. the Home Economics Section of Organized Agriculture. I have heard Mrs. Berger tell of this meeting many times and I am sure that you, too, will enjoy a fev* thoughts from her. Mrs. Berger: "Agriculture is not the whole of rural life. The great rural interests are human interests, and good crops are of little value to the farmer unless they open the way to a good kind of life on the farm." These are the words of the president, Theodore Roose - velt, expressing his belief in rural life when he appointed the Country Life Commission in 1909. Sixteen farm women and eight leaders of other organizations at - tended this conference. Everyone attending was or had been a home - maker. They were typical American farm women. This conference met March 8-11, 19 26 at the Edgewater Beach Hptel, Chicago, under the joint auspices of the American Country Life Association and the Farmer's Wife magazine. Mrs. Charles Schitter of Missouri, herself a farm homemaker, was chairman. She opened the meeting by propounding the question, "What do farm women want, or what are farm women thinking about?" For three days, the twenty-four farm women representing the four quarters of the United States, pondered the question and thrashed it out heartily and with vision and good will. I will try to list some of the varied "wants" of the farm women which were brought into definite notice at this conference: 1. More libraries. 2. Better movies. 3. A bank account. 4. To be classed as women of ability and understanding, not as "farm women". 6. To learn the poetry and charm of life. 6. Recognition of the value of our work. 7. Better educational advantages for our children. 8. Good roads and other means of contact. </seg>
            <seg id="p402">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 9. Beautification of farm homes. 10. Loan funds for girls who wish to enter college. 11. Latest equipment in our homes so we can have some leisure time. 12. Cheaper linoleum that will last just as long. 13. Adult education. 14. Closer cooperation between town and country people. 15. A chance for hobbies. 16. Good music. 17. An intelligent understanding of the importance of agriculture on the part of both town and country. 18. A greater joy in our job. 19. More home demonstration agents. Never before that time had there been a meeting of greater signifi - cance to the farm home and to country life. Never before had such a group of women come together, never before had points of view of organizations interested in rural life been coordinated with the thinking of farm women in a similar discussion. Miss Wolph: Thank you, Mrs. Berger. In November, 1934, through the courtesy of the Country Life Asso - ciation, with the cooperation of the United States Department of Agri - culture, over three hundred rural homemakers from twenty-four states met at Washington, D. C, to discuss the same vital subject. This was the first national Rural Home Conference. The meeting at Columbus was the second national Rural Home Conference. More than four hundred rural women from twenty-two states were present for this meeting — many of them had been at the Washington meeting in November and had lost none of their enthusiasm. Miss Grace E. Frysinger, Senior Home Economist, Extension Ser - vice, U. S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, D. C, was general chairman of this conference. Those of you who have seen and heard her at Organized Agriculture know how capable and charming she Is. She has a very pleasing personality and is very gracious in her manner. I am sure that her acquaintance would be worth much. All of the meetings were held in the Ohio State University buildings. The Rural Home Conference was the first day of the convention. Dr. Carl C. Taylor, president of the Country Life Association and Dr. George W. Rightmire, president of the Ohio State University, extended greetings. Mrs. Edward Young of New York, who represented the International </seg>
            <seg id="p403">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION Organization of Farm Women, brought a message, "Hands Across the Sea", from country women of other lands. She states that "Women' of other lands are trying to solve their problems as we are . . . many organizations of women are founded on religion . . . rural women are - hard at work for world peace." Throughout her message she made us realize that country life and country living the world over have practically the same problems. An interesting feature of this conference was the type of program and the system of the discussion's. "Services Essential to Effective Rural Living and How to Get Them" were presented by rural homemakers who lived on farms and spoke from fact and not from theory. These services were listed under eleven topics and presented by women from nearly as many states. "Health" was presented by a South Carolina woman. "He who has health has hope — He who has hope has everything." She urged the correction in childhood of defects which handicap' later life and emphasized the need of cooperation of rural schools in regard to contagious and infectious diseases. "Religion", as discussed by an Ohio farm mother, is a vital subject. She stated that religion is the cornerstone of a happy home. The auto - mobile, the radio, and the growing lack of interest in religion are im - portant factors in the problem. A farm woman from Mississippi, in her southern dialect, presented the subject, "Leisure Time Activities". The South has much leisure time. If we have leisure time, are we going to waste it or will it be an open door to a world of new experiences, thoughts and interests? The "Housing" problem was led by an Indiana mother who urged a more ideal rural home life. "No one needs electricity more than the farmer," stated the Wis - consin delegate. "We want electricity for all rural America. We cannot but wish for something. We must demand it — and it must be an intelligent demand." The country has not had its opportunity for books and magazines for "Reading". An Ohio woman told of the auto trailer, equipped with shelves, which had carried thousands of books to the farm homes around Springfield, Ohio. "Rural Credit" was ably given by a Virginian. Too much credit is as disastrous as too little. </seg>
            <seg id="p404">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Mrs. Overton most ably discussed "Taxation". Many remarked that the young Nebraskan not only had one of the best articles, but she also presented it in the best manner. She said, "Our children hear too much today of what the govern - ment owes us and not enough of what we owe the government." Mrs. Ellsworth Richardson of Iowa talked of "Citizenship", and the larger duties confronting the farm wife today. She emphasized training in the home, and the need of organization and cooperation. Perhaps a number of you have heard or read of her. I have seen ler name mentioned in several farm papers this winter. She is national ■vice president of the newly organized Associated Women of the Ameri - can Farm Bureau Federation. She has snappy brown eyes with a •certain magnetic quality about them that makes you listen to every word she says. She believes that women speaking with one united ■.voice can do things for rural living. A Georgia representative gave a most worth while discussion of '"Cooperative Endeavors". She named a number of agencies that con - tribute to better living but stated that home demonstration work with. 4-H club work was the greatest cooperative endeavor. A young woman from Kansas, the mother of two children, pre - sented "Education". She emphasized the need of good rural teachers. Let us make America an ideal land in which to bring up our children. All of these discussions were given before the entire group. Fol - lowing this there were discussion groups for these same topics with a chairman, a secretary, a discussion leader, and summarizer. The summaries were reported back to the entire group. The entire con - ference was summarized by Dr. Manny, U. S. Department of Agri - culture. Could anyone wish for a more thorough study? We were much impressed with this system and I know that the committee who planned your program for today trust that you, too, will be pleased with it. The remainder of the convention was held with the American •Country Life Association. There were representatives from many organizations and professions of rural America, all working for the "building of a rural civilization finer than any the world has ever known". Very interesting, forceful and carefully prepared speeches were presented by nationally known men. It was indeed a rare privilege and inspiration to hear such men as: Carl C. Taylor, president of the American Country Life Association; Brooks Hays of the Resettlement Administration; Louis H. Bean, U. S. Department of Agriculture; </seg>
            <seg id="p405">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION' Chris L. Christensen, Wisconsin College of Agriculture; Nat T. Frame, field secretary of the American Country Life Association; C. J. Galpin, honorary president of the American Country Life Association; and many others equally as well informed and interesting. The American Country Life Association was organized in Baltimore in January, 1919, by one hundred seventy-five . delegates, representing thirty states. It helps people and agencies whose purpose is rural improvement and works largely through other organizations or in cooperation with them. The great common objective is an effort to make life in the rural community more adequate, more worthy, more interesting and more beautiful. We left Columbus early Sunday morning, returning a more southern route. The winding roads, beautiful hills, trees and rocks made a most picturesque drive through southern Indiana and Missouri. There was not the result of sufficient rain as we had seen farther north, but the scenery was wonderful. Autumn was painting her colors and nature was at her best. Such scenery is hard to present on the canvas. The quantities of bittersweet, the various shapes and sizes of woven baskets and the piles of melons all "For Sale" told us the occupations of these "hills people." t The two nights on our return were spent at lovely tourist homes. What an experience! Meeting women from so many states, , hear - ing what other people are doing — north, east, south, west, listening to and thinking with those who are intensely interested in the better - ment of rural America, the making of new friends, the giving and doing for others — all these will be pleasant memories. We realize that the world is large, but our aims and ideals are much the same. "If we all stood alone in the battle of life — What a dreary old world this would be! Life is sweet just because of the friends we have made And the things which in common we share; So we ought to live on — not because of ourselves — But because of the people who care. It's the giving and doing for somebody else, On that all life's splendor depends; And the joy of this world (when you've summed it all up) May be found in the making of friends." Are we not all working for the betterment of home and community — for a greater America? Let us trust that there shall be an increasing number of those vitally interested in the welfare of rural America and that all organ- </seg>
            <seg id="p406">REPOKT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE lzations shall -work together for its betterment. May we realize that only with united effort can much be accomplished. The character of a nation depends upon the character of her people. Good thoughts will produce good character. Are we giving to our boys and girls all that is good in training for character and citizenship? Our future citizens certainly deserve the very best we have to give. If posterity Is to be proud of our achievement, let us give the youth of our country all that is noble and true, thus making them citizens that shall "build a rural civilization finer than any the world has ever known". The trip and the conference were worth much to me. I shall ever hold pleasant memories of the week with Mrs. Wallace, Mrs. Overton and Miss Brown. If any of you have the opportunity to travel with Miss Brown, don't hesitate. I can assure you that the gain will be yours. Her ideas and her ideals will be an inspiration to you to live a more abundant life. To the Extension Service, to the state leader of women's work, Miss Brown, to the Cass county home agent. Miss Baldwin, and to any others who may have influenced this trip, I wish to say "Thank you". If at any time I may be of service to any or all of you, I shall be glad to do whatever I am able. May I leave with you the message of this little poem: "So long as there are homes to which men turn At the close of day; So long as there are homes where children are, Where women stay, If love and loyalty and faith be found Across those sills, A stricken nation can recover from its Gravest ills. "So long as there are homes where fires burn, And there is bread; So long as there are homes where lamps are lit, And prayers are said; Altho' a people falter through the dark And nations grope, With God Himself back of these little homes We still have hope." The following committees were appointed at this time to report at the business meeting on Thursday morning, January 9, at 10:15. </seg>

MILDRED INSKEEP MORGAN It is indeed a privilege, I consider it so, to have been invited to be with you these two days. I have always wanted to have this privilege to be present at some state gathering of women such as yours, and this is my first chance and I am delighted to be here. There are several reasons why I have wanted this opportunity. First of all, I believe, is because I was born on a farm south of here where the Blue River empties into the Kaw. I was related to almost everyone in three counties around there. I remember when I was a girl my mother used to say to me, "We think it is safest for you not to say anything about anyone around here because if they are not related to you on o'ne side of the family they are on the other." Last summer when reports came in from that country about the dust storms, the lack of rain, and then too much rain, it seemed almost impossible that it was the same country in which I had lived. It was not just reports that were coming in to us, but reports of people we knew, people about whom we cared tremendously. It was that sort of thing and what those things meant to the people we know, what such </seg>
            <seg id="p408">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE a catastrophe meant to a planned college education, and because of the richness of some of the experiences of mine with these people that it is more than a privilege for me to be here. We visited my mother's home this Christmas. It was a hazardous trip but it was worth it. I am thinking of some of the families with whom we visited when at my mother's home and know that some of the stories told are true for we saw the actual cases. We were delighted that we could be there and get acquainted again with a nephew who was at one time the son of a wealthy farmer. We were glad to see what he was doing in working his way through college at Manhattan. We saw the niece who is taking a business course and working her way. We say another nephew who is carrying on in a splended way. All these people showed me the quality of life which I expect you meet every day. In thinking about that experience I have a feeling that maybe you can tell me a great deal about how we can help our children grow up rather than I tell you because there are some things which we can think through together. It gives us a great deal of confidence to know that perhaps we are on the right track. So what do we mean to grow up in this year, 1936? I think we have done a marvelous job of helping our children to grow up physically. After my family and I came back from abroad and returned to the Middlewest (not my husband for he was born in the South), I had the feeling that I had never seen healthier children and young people than we had here. Our sunshine and our knowledge of food makes it possible for us to help our children to grow up physically, but I do not believe we are doing as good a job in helping our children grow up emotionally as we are physically. What do I mean by growing up emotionally? I believe it is the ability to live with poise and with a certain buoyancy. It is to face one's limitions and to make the most of one's assets. It is to make one's decisions in the light of the facts rather than what one dreams one would like to have come true, to be accepted and liked by one's group because of one's charm and thought for others and finally to have real self-respect and regard for one's self and one's ability and not having an excess amount of it. I believe this is emotional maturity. Let me give you some examples. I have worked a great deal with young high school pupils. They do not live long with you, with their teachers, nor with their contemporaries without knowing whether they are grown up or not. I have heard them say that Miss so and so, who teaches English, or Miss so and so, who teaches mathematics, just blessed a boy out the other day. It was not his fault, but her indigestion, or because she was not invited to a party, or was not elected by the school board. Maybe she is suffering from the loss of sleep. These young people know what it is to be emotionally grown up. They are very sympathetic many times. </seg>
            <seg id="p409">NEHKASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION I have met at summer conferences a good many young people. They have come to talk to me about conflicts in their homes. They were trying to find a way of working it out, as these conditions have existed for a long time. Many of them would say, "I don't believe we have gotten along so very well in the family. The whole economic arrangement has made it difficult for the members of the family to bear the strain." I notice in the last few years that we have been worried, that we have had a terrifflc feeling of insecurity with financial burdens, not knowing whether we would lose our land in the spring or whether we would be able to raise the interest, and all this has ground into our spirits so that we do not have much buoyancy of spirit left. I have found in working with camps that young people can outdo a spoiled child. They can do it in short order. The person who always wants to be the center of the stage or the girl who plays up to the boys can be brought out of this very quickly in a camp. In one of the camps I attended, one of the girls asked several of the boys at the breakfast table to peel her orange for her. The next morning she tried it again and they would not do it. She was amazed because they did not do it. She did not do her kitchen duty, nor would the rest help her do it. She soon saw that the people who were making a hit in that camp were the girls who did their share of the work, who could swim or play tennis. She suddenly realized about the third day that her tactics were not working, for she said to one of the adult leaders, "I am losing my public." The leader Baid, "Yes, you are losing your public and you probably will have to use some other method to regain it." She was the spoiled kind and the young people of her kind took it out of her. That girl grew up in those ten days. But the boys and girls who are shy, timid, or who are not sure of themselves present another problem. They think the things they do are not as good as those done by others, yet are miserable because other people do worth while things. These people will not enter into an activity. A girl will say, "I don't like swimming. I can't swim quite as well as Susie. I do want to make an impression on John." So she stays out of the water. It is these people who are finding it difficult to grow up. We cannot praise too much if it is absolutely sound. I am sure that most of the mothers I know do not say anything when things go well; but when things go wrong they do much talking. Sometimes children brag when they are not sure of themselves. They brag to cover up their timidity. They would not brag if they didn't have to do so. If people have to talk about their achievements, they are the ones most insecure in those achievements. We should give people the assurance they need. I believe that we do not give the people who are growing up in our families enough security. We are living in a very complex world, much more complex than in the world in </seg>
            <seg id="p410">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE which we grew up and in the one in which our parents grew up. We see the world with the eyes with which we grew up. Why is It -we are so anxious for our young people to grow up? I think that our young people ought to be free to tell us about their world and we ought to be free to tell them about what we think of it. Together we can come to some conclusion which is neither ours nor theirs, but by work- Ing together we do much wider living than we do now and we find that we would keep alive in two generations and we will help our children to grow up in a way in which they are not growing up now. A lot of people, because of the lack of poise, are breaking under the strain. Our mental sanitariums and hospitals are overcrowded because of the strain under which people are living. The finest thing you can give to your children is not to have the land passed on to them, not to give them anything in the way of material gain and satisfaction, but to bo live with them that they come out emotionally mature people and able to stand the strain which comes to them. How can we help our children to grow up? I believe we can help our children to grow up most by our achievement of a calm and buoyant spirit. As women we are taking it much as our right to get nervous. We should not get irritable and nervous as we do. In a research study which has been done with over 8,000 school children, it was found that the children who said their parents were "nervous, seldom or never", were the best adjusted of the group. Their parents did few things they did not like. The children in this group of 8,000 best adjusted persons like to confide in their parents. They like both parents equally well. Sometimes we as mothers feel proud that the children like us better than our husbands. We shouldn't feel this way. We should share our joys and sorrows. It was also brought out by this study that the par - ents of these best adjusted children were living together, separated neither by death nor divorce. They had not been punished by their parents during the past week. Their parents had not been ill during the past year. In order to help our children to grow up we must start the process when very young. A child can be spoiled very badly during the first year of his life so that much re-education would need to take place before he could live a satisfying life either to himself or to others. It is true you may say, "Well, it doesn't mean so much. He is just a baby." You will find when he is grown he is still a baby. When a child is born way down the line after the other children, it has about one chance in 500 of not being spoiled. He will love being the center of attention. That child cannot grow up without being spoiled. Then, too, we hold on to the last child. I remember in one high school two boys came to me. These two boys were football players. Their families would not let them date. </seg>
            <seg id="p411">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATipX They were both big enough to walk out and date if they wanted to do so. This is the tale they told me. The first one said there were five men in his family and he was the youngest one, so his mother wanted to keep him at home as long as she could. They said it was because of his football training that they wanted to keep him home. The other boy said he was the only child. He said he cared a lot about his parents, but he didn't want to sit around with their friends all the time. He said he got along: better with the older people than he did with young people his own age. We can make children of too much im - portance or we can let them get away with eating just what they want. When they are grown men they will be spoiled in their eating habits and will have trouble with their wives. There are grown men who are just as spoiled in their eating habits as little Willie. We can also say this is true of sleeping habits, elimination and playing. The same is true of children who play alone. There is a difference between children who play alone and those who play with other children. If they learn to play with others before they start to school, parents have done a great thing for those children. When she started to nursey school, our little daughter wasn't usea to having someone knock her over the head. But she soon learned how to take care of herself in this school. You don't need to send youi children to nursery school, but get groups of children together in the community from time to time. If they have a chance to play with children of their own age, it will make a great deal of difference in how they give and take. And another thing, it helps them to do things for themselves. There is an age when children long to do things for themselves. This business of taking time and of having patience to show a child how to tie her shoe laces means, that you are doing something very priceless. In the nursery where our daughter attended, they had a child they did not want to advance from the four-year group because she couldn't do things for herself. They found that she was getting all her satisfac - tion from having people wait on her. The family had a taxi bring her to school, and the taxi driver had to carry her into school or she would just sit down on the curb and not go in. The school authorities found that at home she was carried from room to room. Think what her husband will have to do if she doesn't change. A great deal of education will be needed to bring her up. I am giving extremes in order that you may see things more clearly. We need to understand the following adjustments which an adoles - cent needs to make in order to grow into a well adjusted adult. I think I will state these and then explain them. First, a boy or girl wants to become a person in his own right, not </seg>
            <seg id="p412">KEPOKT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE leaning too heavily on his parents either for moral support or emo - tional backing. Second, a person wants to be accepted in a friendly fashion by one's own age group. One wants to be accepted, not left out of the group. One wants to feel that he or she is not too different. Third, adolescents want to achieve a wholesome relationship with the opposite sex. This is of fundamental importance and our chief way of dealing with it at present is by fear or letting chance take its course. Fourth, adolescents want to achieve a realistic attitude toward the value of work and of money. Fifth, to achieve a philosophy and a workable religion of one's own (not taken over bodily from one's parents) by which one determines one's standards of action and by which one lives one's life day by day. . ■ ■ ■ The first one, to become a person in his own right. There is the example of the two boys, the parents holding them in the nest and not letting them make contacts with other people. It is so easy to do that. Usually we feel that we want our young people to depend on us. We should be proud to let them make a decision for themselves. We should say to them, "I congratulate you on making this decision." But we want to feel the sense of importance. I know a grown woman who cannot buy a dress without someone being along. We should never be afraid to let the young people stand on their own feet. If they make a mistake, don't say, "I told you so." Don't rub it n. I have read much about the 4-H club work. It seems to be doing so much good along the line of training the young people to do things for themselves. Second, to be accepted in a friendly fashion by one's own age group. You have no idea of the feeling high school persons have when they feel they have a group to which they really belong. Don't have them hurry back home without some chance of belonging to some club, for that is the way they make their friends for themselves. Encourage them to do something whereby they stand out in a group. If you can possibly help it, don't let them get their status from the way they dress or the way they get themselves together. That is not a very sound basis. You can help them to make the most of their assets. Third, to achieve a wholesome relationship with the opposite sex. I shall speak more on this subject this afternoon. Fourth, to achieve a realistic attitude toward the value of work and money. We have a housekeeper in our home all the time In order to make it possible for me to do my work. She has every Tuesday, </seg>
            <seg id="p413">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION Thursday, and every fourth week-end off. Then we have a student come in. We try to have the same one every time but sometimes that is impossible. I have been amazed at the things these university students could not do. We have taught Beveral of them to cook. It has been quite painful. The girl who was in during the Christmas holidays was one of this type. I asked her if she would finish the ironing. There were only a few things. She said she would be de - lighted to try, but her mother would never let her do it at home be - cause she couldn't do it well enough. One of the wisest things my mother ever did was to step out and let us take turns at housekeeping in the summer. We didn't learn to sew. That took too much good calico, muslin, etc. But we did learn to cook. The adolescent person must plan his work. The value of knowing how to work means planning it. Another thing we need to know is the value of money. By research I have found that children need allowances for spending money. Now I am certain that allowances should take into account things they have to buy to clothe themselves, otherwise they think that money is for fun, and father foots the bills. We do not learn the use of anything except by using it. I am most certain that high school people need to have money in their own hands to know how to use it. How are they to get that experience? We do need to spend some money on these children if we possibly can. Begin keeping accounts to find what you spend on them and let them begin spending it on themselves. Look over the accounts to Bee what It has been used for. The child needs to know what you have spent on him. Let him spend the money himself. He will take more if he has a certain amount to spend, but he will realize that money cannot be spent twice. So long as you hold the purse strings, he thinks it can be done. The owning of money is a very important thing if you can arrange it, but do give the young people a chance to know how to use it and use it wisely. You have a chance of letting them earn their own money on the farm. The earning is a very important thing as well. Fifth, to achieve a philosophy and a workable religion of one's own. Sometimes we get off on the subject of religion when a group of my husband's young friends come to the house. One boy said his mother thinks he has none just because he thinks differently than she does, just because he does not follow the family thought. 1 He may have a fine workable religion. Young people think that they have no religion. In reality, it is just that they do not think in the same terms as their parents do. Many of them have a workable religion, but do not realize it. We are to blame. We are not willing to have them call it religion. The way they live their life, the things by which they are making their standards, that is religion. The way you live your life and the things </seg>
            <seg id="p414">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE to which you give yourself reservedly is religion. I have heard young people remark that they can't say that to their parents. Because of too much criticism, they are afraid to say what they think and what they feel. The topic, Essentials for Effective Rural Living, include in part the topics used in the program for the Rural Home Conference in Columbus which Miss Wolfe described in her talk. The women who gave these talks were asked to tell their ideas of the parts these essentials play in effective rural living. ESSENTIAIiS FOB EFFECTIVE RURAL LIVING Health MRS. ALVIN GARD Last year at the meeting of the Home Economics Section of Organ - ized Agriculture, Miss Clare Rausch told you, "The people of America are said to be health-minded. We are said by some to know more about health than any other nation. One hears talk about health on all sides." When I attempted to find the references so kindly suggested for this topic and was unable to locate the proposed material, either locally or at our county seat, I began to wonder, "Are we as health - minded as we ought to be?" Too, I became about as excited as a young wife. Her husband being ill, she tried to take the patient's temperature and, greatly excited, sent their doctor this urgent message: "Dear Doctor: Please come at once. My husband's temperature Is 136°." The physician replied: "Dear Madam: The case Is beyond my skill. Send for the fire engine." When regarded as an essential for effective rural living, health must be considered from a different phase than we have considered it in the past. Our children are our chief concern. Some day they will be the citi - zens of our communities. We shall want them to be the best kind of citizens in a community — clean, healthful and beautiful. How are we going to achieve such a goal? Individually we can do many things to keep ourselves in health, but when we have done all that we are able to, there remains much that must be done by the cooperation of all of us. Health and its pro- </seg>
            <seg id="p415">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION tection cannot be left altogether to the individual because everyone does not take pride in personal cleanliness. Country folk can get more sunlight, more fresh air, more good food and exercise than the city dweller. On the other hand, some health authorities say that we who live in the country are likely to be care - less about the water we drink, careless about the milk we use, careless about flies, also. Do you agree? If our communities are to be the healthful places for living that we desire them to be, there are some particular rules of community health that need to be considered. These are: protection of the water supply from pollution, safe disposal of garbage and proper disposal of sewage, guarding against flies and mosquitoes, and protection of the milk supply by getting milk from healthy cows and handled by clean people. The control and prevention of disease merits our attention also. There is no reason for thinking that diseases will come anyway and that all we can do about it is simply make the best of it when they do come. We parents should realize the importance and necessity of early immunization of our children against all contagious and infectious diseases by the use of the accepted methods now known to modern medicine. For example, about 5,000 children died of diphtheria in the United States last year — 5,000 unnecessary deaths in view of our present knowledge of diphtheria prevention. It is a good thing to know enough about diseases to know how to avoid them. If care is taken to prevent sickness it saves time, money and lives. Likewise, when diseases do come, we should know how to check their spread. Quarantine regulations are one of the safeguards of health when combating the contagious diseases. Every community ought to have a department of health, a board of health, or a health officer to protect its people. We should learn some - thing of the duties of the public health departments and cooperate with them. A state health department is given the authority to do for villages and rural districts what the city health officer does in the larger cities. Our federal government maintains a Public Health Service. Do you know what this national department contributes to our welfare? Our Department of Agriculture has a special division known as the Poods and Drugs Administration which enforces the laws respecting the sale of food, medicine and drugs. Are you aware that the United States Chamber of Commerce has </seg>
            <seg id="p416">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE for the past several years been conducting a sort of contest on com - munity health? Every year each local Chamber of Commerce is re - quired to answer questionnaires pertaining to the different phases of health activities of each community. What methods should be employed to secure better health condi - tions? Although many laws are passed to protect the community, every citizen has to help. Adults may study the causes and prevention of diseases. They might learn what laws should be made to safeguard the health of the community. We might think that only those who vote are citizens. This is not true. Children are citizens just as much as their parents, although they do not have all the privileges that adults have. Boys and girls in school can be taught the reasons for good health habits and how to form them. Our children, through proper hygiene lessons, will learn just what they might contribute toward keeping their community healthy. Already children throughout the country are doing their bit for better community health. In many places children at school have made food analysis and inspection for their own homes. In some instances, children have made a detailed report of the milk business in their communities. In Sioux City, Iowa, children took part in a Get-More-Sleep program. Georgia has a Junior Public Health Organ - ization. ,, In some communities school children have rendered a big service by making sanitary surveys, one of the most successful of these being undertaken in an Arkansas county. A community civics book listed some fine questions. How would you answer these queries? "What has been done by your school, or any society with which you are connected, to improve the health of your community in general?" "When you discover some condition in your community which Is dangerous to health, what ought you to do about it?" . "Can a community determine whether its people will be healthy or not?" "To what extent does the health of your community depend on you?" Cleanliness, orderliness, wholesome living — these make us strong and healthy and our community a pleasant place in which to live. Sir Richard Baker says: "To gather riches, do not hazard health, For truth to say, health is the wealth of wealth." </seg>
            <seg id="p417">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION RELIGION IN THE HOME MRS. VENICE EDMONDSON - -i . Homemakers! What a thrilling title and what a great responsi - bility! A homemaker should provide for the fullest development of each personality within her home. It is her duty not only to care for the physical and mental growth of her children, but also for the spiritual as well. She must bring God into their lives so that their entire per - sonalities are dominated and motivated by His spirit. Before the advent of the Sunday School the religious education of the children was carried on within the family circle, but since that time parents have turned more and more of this duty over to the organization of the church. The results have not been so good and I am not criticis - ing the church. The short time they have the children under their supervision is not adequate. The spiritual training should begin when the child is very young, preferably while he is still in his cradle. As you tuck him in at night, kneel and thank God for the privileges of motherhood and ask Him to direct your efforts as you train your child in habits that will bring the Christ-like way of life to him. Very soon your mood of devotion will be shared by the little child and after a time he will say his prayers for you and you for him. You will then have trained him in the prayer habit and also established a beautiful confidential relationship between you. When he is young, do not worry about the teaching of formal religion, but teach him to see God in all that is about him; in the beauties of his creations, in the pets and animals about him, and in his association with others. Take him out under the stars and tell him what the scientists have learned about the universe. Then read from your Bible what ancient men thought about the stars and God. Show him the beauty of the landscape in every season of the year, the rainbow, the sun set, the falling snow, the rain and lightning: all God's gifts of love. Let him listen to an egg in which the chicken is picking and let him hold a newly hatched chicken in his hand. Show him the beauty and perfection of the little thing and remind him that it, too, is God's creation and something for him to love and protect. Teach him to protect and care for his pets and other animals on the farm. His joys in living will be greatly increased. Rural children, because of their close contacts with the reproduc - tion of animal life, will, while quite young, ask questions concerning birth and if the proper confidential relationship exists between you and </seg>
            <seg id="p418">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE your child, lie will ask you. Be prepared to tell him the story of life in a beautiful and honest way, making it an opportunity to draw him nearer to the Divine Creator. There is much material available, so that no mother need be unprepared. In your own home, set a good example of Christian cooperation between the members of your family and the people of your neighbor - hood. Teach your child to look upon all as friends, even those of other races, because they, too, are God's children. Do not pass on to him any prejudices of race, creed or clan. And remember, homemakers, that religion is caught and not taught. In closing, I would like to leave some questions for your considera - tion between now and the round table discussion this afternoon. 1. Do you allow Saturday night entertainments and Sunday morn - ing chores to interfere with regular Sunday school and church attend - ance? 2. Are you developing Christian leadership in your family? 3. Are you teaching the Bible .in a way that will bring conflict in your child's mind when he studies some of the sciences? READING MRS. G. I. MURRAY Reading, one of the fundamental needs for better rural living, has been neglected in the stress of the past few years, but the rural mother is realizing that she must assume the responsibility of a reading program for her children. First, let us consider where reading really begins — the rural school. The pre-school child has been read to, but now he takes up reading for himself. He has a natural curiosity and a desire to find out things for himself. Here reading is one of the 3 R's — in fact the basic R for all other studies, and if the child can and does read understandingly, his education becomes a joy. This does not mean reading as a study alone, but as a means toward satisfying his curiosity and acquiring informa - tion, and only in the 'land of books' can this be found — the school library — which at most has been a haphazard collection with little thought as to the various child's needs. Nebraska has taken a very definite step in this direction through the Rural School Library Law, passed in 1930, which provides that each district use the sum of $5.00 per teacher per year for the pur - chase of library books, these to be purchased by the board. A read- </seg>
            <seg id="p419">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION Ing committee of the Nebraska State Teachers' Association each year prepares a list of books reviewed by these educators and recommended for rural school grades. Most county superintendents use this list in their suggestions to the board for purchase of library books. In the past five years, do you know what books have been added to your school library? Have they been purchased mostly to satisfy the Interest of a few in the school, or purchased with a view that In a few years a splendid library of travel, history, adventure and fun will meet the needs of all the grades of the rural school. I believe this library a splendid opportunity for the mother to help direct the child's reading and create a desire for the best in liter - ature by her knowledge of the books accessible to him. A few minutes taken to read parts of the child's book, then discuss a character, a situation or the author with him, is more than repaid in the develop - ment of his reading habits. If books and their discussions are part of the rural child's school and home life, the problem of questionable books and magazines is greatly lessened when it becomes necessary for the child to stay in a town or city for his high school training. There the public library is at his service, with all manner of reading material for his school reference work, and innumerable fine books for his leisure time. How better can his evenings be spent than in reading? He brings home a new outlook and a broader vision which naturally proves a stimulus for the family reading. The first need then for reading in the rural home is vocational, or that reading the farm family needs in order to understand the Im - proved practices in home life, crops, soils and live stock, and through discussion create the desire to carry these out for better farm living. Certainly the boy and girl have a renewed interest for farm life, if .they are shown that they, the future farmers, will have a part in this planned development. The second need is inspirational, or that reading the farm family needs in order to contribute its share in community life. The reading of periodicals, books and references for use in program and discussions in Parent Teachers Associations, church, project clubs, 4-H clubs, and other community clubs comes under this classification. The third need fs recreational, or that reading which the farm family does for fun and entertainment, which includes winter time leisure reading for adults, Vacation reading for children and general reading for all. A great deal has been accomplished to increase this reading through book reviews and book clubs of various types. One type of book club I wish to describe apA in which I am </seg>

            <seg id="p422">KEI'OKT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE fortunate enough to take part in is a group of eight, each of whom pur - chases a book particularly interesting to that family, read it and pass it along. In this way, each family becomes the owner of one good book and has the privilege of reading seven others. An envelope ac - companies each book, into which a small contribution is placed by each reader, which provides a nucleus for next year's new book. There can be no pleasure greater than the ownership of a good book to read and re-read and to be looked forward to by the children in turn, and passed on for others to enjoy. Summing up rural reading, we have three objectives for the rural mother to consider in her program — education, inspiration and recrea - tion, but with present limited finances how and where is she to ob - tain the material? A request to your local county agent, or to the Agricultural College Extension Service will bring bulletins on any phase of agriculture or better home living. The State Library Commission has a list of references and books available on request, but this supply is limited and must serve the state. There are also some traveling libraries, but they also reach only a small part of the rural readers. This lack of available material makes this a community problem rather than an individual one, the need of rural library service. Again Nebraska is forging ahead with the 1935 county or regional library law, with plans for the extension of library service to rural people. Since we are the people who will benefit most by this law, we should interest ourselves and our community toward obtaining this service. We are very fortunate to have as our reading round table chairman, Miss Nellie Carey, Executive Secretary of the Nebraska State Library Commission, and as a guest, Mrs. Roy Cochran, who has been a tireless worker for reading improvement in Nebraska; I know we will benefit greatly by their explanation and discussion of the problem. LEISURE TIME ACTIVITIES MRS. CLAY WALLACE This subject, "Leisure Time Activities", has very properly been given a place as one of eight essentials of effective rural living. Until a comparatively recent time, leisure as a part of the rural homemaker's life was given little consideration because it simply did not exist. Her life was an endless succession of work; "a woman's work is never done" ■was commonly accepted as fact. </seg>
            <seg id="p423">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION Educators and others interested in the improvement of rural conditions have recognized this as a serious condition and have taken steps to correct it. Labor saving equipment in the home has been urged with a view toward making the work easier and thus releasing time for other pursuits. All recognize that there is much more to the job of homemaking than merely keeping house, preparing meals and sewing, to say nothing of the other endless demands such as the care of chickens and garden. A woman, tired to the point of exhaustion with these things, has little left to provide for the spiritual uplift of herself or her family. To the true homemaker, there is much of creative work in the performance of these tasks, but neither creative work nor drudgery can be endured without respite. As human beings, we need reasonable recreation. So I believe we must arrange our program to provide a certain amount of leisure time, which will supply pleasure and inspiration. To use this leisure wisely is the next consideration. The selection of a hobby Is one solution. The word itself suggests play — relaxation of body and mind. A hobby is the thing we like to do — it claims our interest. Many women through their hobbies find enjoyment and diversion; they develop self-confidence and poise. A mother needs to select a hobby for herself because the wisest possible use of leisure apart from recreational needs is to devote it to creative activity. It is soul-satisfying to do those things through which one may express her own personality in the form of some product which bears the stamp of her own hand and brain. Some of the following popular arts attract the interest of women r music, drama, folk lore, games and sports, literary pursuits, home and countryside beautiflcation, handicraft, painting, sculpture and allied arts, exhibits, conservation of records, and treasures, art in work. Rural people are finding additional homemade happiness in avocational activities. These endeavors are of value as new and varied ways of using human time and energy. To quote from a recent magazine, "The happy person is the one who dies with hundreds of unfulfilled wants, yei. whose curiosity and joy in living increased with the years." The common interests of the rural family represent one of its finest assets. Parents today are confronted with a real problem in meeting forces which tend to draw young people away from the home for entertainment. As one speaker at the Columbus, Ohio meeting said, "Home is becoming a garage and filling station." Parents need to develop in the minds of their children certain qualities which will enable them to use their leisure time wisely. Under proper guidance, good reading habits may be established. Through glee clubs, band and other musical organizations, music is doing much to provide both </seg>
            <seg id="p424">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE recreational and creative opportunity. These and other Inner rescources can be developed In young people so that they do not have to seek the external and temporary for enjoyment. From the August 31, 1935 number of the magazine, School and Society, I find this statement: "Recreation and leisure time have not only been commercialized, but have fallen into the hands of the most commercial, the least social, the most unscrupulous and the least moral group in our modern society. And the commercial group has turned the period of relaxation, the most fertile of all fields for culture and refinement, into a field of Idle dissipation." We need to guard against the tendency to seek excitement and self-indulgence in order to kill time and break the monotony. Such a tendency leads to the condition that everything is monotonous that la not exciting. The cultivation of hobbies is a suggested remedy here also. Dramatics furnishes recreation and an opportunity for develop- ' ment of talent as well as a source of entertainment in community gatherings. The community is just a larger home and our influence and interest must go out and beyond our own four walls. We must help our young people to find satisfaction in homemade Jobs, in creative work, in experimental farm and home activities. Old and young need the contacts which come through good whole - some play. It has been said, "Play makes the child into a man and keeps the man a child, growing and improving all his life." The rural home then becomes a vital source of strength and stability in the de - velopment of our whole community. ELECTRICITY MARY PARTINGTON There are approximately only a little over ten per cent of the farms in the United States that have been electrified. Why? Is it possible to make electricity practical on the farm? Here are hampering conditions: 1. Expense. Charges for energy are far higher than those of the city dweller. 2. Additional expense for installing rural lines from farm home to the current-bearing line. The already burdened farmer cannot afford such private extension. 3. Lack of finances by electric companies. </seg>

Simple block rates — having price per kilowatt drop sharply in second and following blocks of schedule. 3. Minimum monthly bill should not exceed $3.00 or $3.50 and this sum should include enough current (40 to 5.0 kilowatt hours) for ordinary lighting and minor household appliances. Projects will vary according to cost and number of consumers. 4. Customer contracts for rural service with monthly minimum guarantee should have definite termination for such guarantees, such as three years. 5. Areas with three or four customers to the mile should be built without customer contributions. 6. Rules governing extension should be phrased so that customer can understand them without an interpreter. The important requirement of the present and future REA is plan - ning.

Money for such workers to buy food — the farmers' products. 4. Economic and cultural betterment of rural life. EDUCATION MRS. L. J. SIERK In a philosophical sense, education is the natural inheritance of every individual, since he is impressed and developed for good or evil by all with which he comes in contact. Everything he sees, feels, hears and does influences action and forms tendencies. According to this view, education begins with parental influence and is a continuous process. The true aim in education deals with the physical, intellectual and moral. Physical culture should train the body that it may be strong, healthy, vigorous, graceful, skillful and responsively active to </seg>
            <seg id="p427">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION the will. Intellectual culture should engage the mind with and de - velop the love for knowledge and prepare for regular practice in the use of knowledge. Moral culture should strengthen the conscience and will by the formation of habit in carrying out pure feeling and good thpught and implant self-faith as the result of faith in our Lord. The manual, "Rural Education Moving Forward," by Director of Rural Education in Nebraska, Miss Cliloe Baldridge, which is in the hands of every Nebraska teacher and superintendent, is issued with the hope that it will prove useful to school officers, patrons and teachers. The Nebraska program is based on the rights of the develop - ing child and the eleven objectives in rural education are, namely: 1. For every child an education which, through the discovery and development of his individual abilities, prepares him for life. 2. For every child social experiences. 3. For every child understanding and the guarding of his person - ality as his most precious right. 4. For every child promotion of health, including health exam - inations, health instructions, a health program and wholesome physical and mental recreation. 5. For every child education for safety and protection against accidents to which modern conditions subject him. 6. For every child spiritual and moral training that will enable him to stand firm under the pressure of life. 7. For every child an appreciation of good music and the joy of singing. 8. For every child such teaching and training as will prepare him for the rights of citizenship. 9. For every child a school that is safe from hazards, sanitary, properly equipped, lighted and ventilated. 10. For every child good books and good magazines. 11. For every child a community which recognizes and plans for his needs, protects him against physical dangers, moral hazards and disease; provides him with safe and wholesome places for play and recreation.

The home should be interested in the public schools and also in the schools of the public. Some of the agencies for public education for our young people out - side of our public schools are: churches, church schools, public libraries, 4-H clubs, Smith-Hughes courses, Boy Scout and Camp Fire Girls groups, Junior Red Cross, and wholesome playground activities. Since we agree that education is a continuous process we will name some of the agencies that are essential today for effective rural living for the adult: church, church school, public libraries, study clubs, home demonstration clubs, Farm Bureau home projects such as home beautification and public speaking for farm women, extension bulletins, night schools, daily press and good magazines. Just last week I read of a new type of school. Through a $2,000, - 000 gift made by Lucius Littauer, Harvard university is to have a school to train men for public service. Certainly government is a matter of sufficient importance to warrant establishment of schools to train persons in the art of governing. Under our democratic system, we do not expect or require that our candidates or executives have special training for administrative experience. We pick our officials largely on the basis of their reputation for integrity and personal suc - cesses. The Harvard school is an interesting experiment and a needed department in education. In the June, 1935, issue of the American magazine was an article, "Education on the Auction Block" by Thomas M. Johnson who says that thousands of students in the United States are putting them - selves on the auction block of higher education to be sold to the highest bidder. The bidders are colleges and universities, through their presi - dents, deans, registrars, professors and traveling salesmen. Kid - napping of students from one college by another has become so fre - quent that educators are crying out against it. As homemakers we should use our influence to put an end to this practice. We hope that the committee appointed to investigate this unfair solicitation of students is successful in checking this method in colleges that make a practice of trying to thereby increase enrollment and also bid - ding on athletes. Students who want an education today have a better opportunity than they have ever had in the history of the nation. </seg>
            <seg id="p429">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION COOPERATIVE ENDEAVORS MRS. W. H. SWARTZ A little more than one hundred years ago, there were some weavers, who on looms set up in their own homes, manufactured fabrics for sale. The steam engine was invented and as fast as weaving machines and steam engines to turn them could be made and installed in factories, these weavers were displaced by machines. Through no fault of theirs, more and more of them were thrown out of work. A group of them drifted into the habit of gathering at the ale house at Rochdale in northern England and talking over their hard luck and discussing the disadvantages of machine production, even as we do today. Mr. James Lawrence of the University of Nebraska says: "Sometimes these discussions end in just talk; while at other times, out of the sword play of argument, may come an idea which will grow and develop into something." One evening in the ale house there was a little more than the ordinary drowning of woes; and one of their number, Charles Howarth, stayed after the others had gone and sat down and figured just how much their number had spent for ale that evening. As the story goes, he found that the money they had spent would have bought a roll of butter, a bag of white flour, seven loaves of bread, or a half a load of fire wood. He talked with his neighbors and out of their talks they developed an idea. Briefly this is what they did. They pledged themselves to each save two-pence, or 4$ a week. When they had saved 28 pounds, about $140.00, they started a little coopera - tive store and "Cooperation was on its way." This story of Rochdale is a true story. Please hold its main features, for out of it grew intri - guing stories and great results. When Mr. Cowden of North Kansas City went to the fourteenth Congress of Inter-National Alliance in London in 1934, his party were going through Rochdale and someone said, "There It is! There it is! The first Coop Store." At this same congress, a polite Japanese gentleman rose to tell that the farmers in his country had a cooperative for the warehousing of silk worm cocoons. A delegate from Iceland reported to a coopera - tive to pipe hot water from their hot springs to their homes and to their green houses. England is ahead of us, in that instead of dividing all the profits of their stores, they saved a little (as did the weavers) and used it to build up gradually factory products for their stores — clothing, shoes, boots — from Alpine boots to babies' sandals — store fixtures, milk crates, soap, lubricating oils, eye glasses, paint, leather goods, cutlery, rope twine, drugs, coal, washing machines, radios. Our own Mrs. Ruth Bryan Owen reported when she went to Den - mark as Minister that the Danish people were prosperous and con- </seg>
            <seg id="p430">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE tented. How does that happen? Didn't they have a World war? And a depression? Have they better soil? Are they more capable than we? Here is the story. One hundred thirty-eight years ago the Danish farmers were serfs, sold with the land, like the buildings and cattle. Their forefathers had been slaves for six hundred years. Then in 1788 they were liberated by Prince Regent Frederick. They started on their climb to independence where forty per cent of the people owned eighty per cent of the land and where the soil was poor, thin and unproductive. When the cooperative idea reached them, seventy-five years ago, they banded together to help themselves through group marketing. Through cooperative marketing, cooperative credit, cooperative education, the Danish farmers have made themselves the most wealth-holding, the most land-owning, and the best educated farmers in the world. During this same period in 1788 when the Danes were liberated from slavery, we in the United States were ratifying our bill of rights, our constitution, which gave us liberty of choice and liberty of action. And we were starting to farm the largest amount of untouched fertile farm land in the world — land, free for the taking, or at a very low price per acre. Starting with almost universal land ownership, American farmers have gone down hill for the ensuing one hundred forty-seven years, until they are the most wealth-losing, land-losing, and intelli - gence-losing farmers in the world. That is, during the same years in which American farmers have gone down hill, Danish farmers through cooperative marketing, cooperative credit and cooperative education have lifted themselves from the very bottom of the hill to the very top. All but five per cent own their own land. They are the richest, best educated, most contented farmers in the world. This story I quoted from Dr. Macy Campbell of Iowa State College. How about Nebraska? Must we sit in the ale houses, trying to drown our troubles till they learn to swim? Or wail about the ma - chine age, while we accept charity? Not unless we wish. There are laws authorizing and encouraging cooperative organizations. There are one hundred years of success and failure to guide us. There are trained managers and advisors. Cooperative endeavors will solve our problems. I wish the round table this afternoon were a general ses - sion; it seems so important to me. I hope you will come! </seg>

            <seg id="p432">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE or college, we were through with education. Now we have come to see that education is more than book-learning. We expect our schools to place in our hands the key to the storehouse of the world's knowl - edge — that is, the ability to read and interpret the printed page. Through this ability, education can become a continuous process, lasting through life. Adult education is as old as Aristotle, the Greek philosopher, but we are now facing the greatest revival in adult education in the history of the world. This adult education movement is one of the most signi - ficant in the field of all education today. Besides our great instutions of learning which are stressing education for the adult, we have hun - dreds of civil organizations, women's clubs and church societies all giving valuable instruction. All of these aids with our libraries, news - papers, magazines and the radio make it possible for every intelligent being to continue his education and inform himself in almost any sub - ject in which he may be interested. Margaret Slattery, author and lecturer of Boston, in an address before the National Education Association, said: "The United States of America has but one serious menace at the present moment. That menace is not to be found primarily in any political party nor even in the unemployment and poverty we have reason to fear, nor in gangs who challenge our system of government. That menace is ignorance. If we are to be good homemakers, we must first inform ourselves before we can intelligently assume our duties as citizens or take the responsibility of directing our youth. Our first responsibility as a citizen is to familiarize ourselves with the constitution of the United States as well as our own state constitution. We should understand just what rights and privileges are guaranteed us by "the American Bill of Rights". We owe it to ourselves and to our families to under - stand better the fundamental ideas and principles of government upon which this nation is founded. It is hard for the woman of today to realize that there was a time not so long ago when we did not enjoy equal political, industrial, and educational opportunities. We can scarcely realize that we did not have the right of franchise, but as far as a vote in our country's affairs were concerned, we were placed on the same plane with the unfortunate inmates of the asylums and penitentiaries. We cannot fully understand the significance in our present day status until we read the stories of the lives of some of the courageous women such as Susan B. Anthony who was a nationally known figure in the movements for anti-slavery and total abstinence before the Civil war. Then after the war she waged a determined fight for woman's suffrage. ■ </seg>
            <seg id="p433">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION Another noble character was Anna Howard Shaw, a great friend of Susan B. Anthony, who was the first woman ordained to the ministry only after a long struggle against opposition from her brother ministers She was also a strong supporter of th,e suffrage movement. It was through the tireless efforts and tenacity of purpose of these and many other brave women that we stand today on an equality with the men of our country in intelligence, our right of franchise, our right to a place in the economic world, the world of professions, literature science and politics. It is through these rights that we now have such nationally known figures as our own Ruth Bryan Owen, Foreign Minister to Denmark, and Mrs. Bertha Landis who was elected mayor of Seattle the eigh - teenth city in size in the United States, not as a woman's candidate but strongly supported by the men on the platform of "more busi - ness and efficiency in city government and a sane enforcement of law not a frenzy of reform." With our rights as voting citizens, we also carry a grave responsi - bility. We should be greatly concerned that this voting privilege is exercised by so few of the womanhood of the nation. We should feel that through our understanding of public questions and by exercising our right of franchise is the only way to bring about better politics and cleaner and wiser government. It is our duty as homemakers not only to inform ourselves on the political parties and platforms upon which they base their appeals for our votes, but we must see that the youth in our homes have the proper literature to read and the proper training so that they too may have an understanding of our problems and the ability to think for themselves as a guarantee against propaganda. Beside making a study of the national, state and local laws and teaching our families respect for law observance and law enforce - ment we should be concerned with all of the influences in the community which touch the lives of our youth. Our recreation centers should be the type that have wholesome influences. We should be interested in and give our support to such organizations as the 4-H clubs, Boy Scouts, Campflre Girls and other worthwhile groups. We should be especially concerned with the types of movies and the programs which &lt;:ome into our homes through the medium of the radio. Can you feature what it would mean if every woman in every woman's organiza - tion today would unite against the advertising of liquors and cigarettes •over the radio? We, as. homemakers, need to make a careful study of all major problems ficing the American citizen of today. There is no doubt that </seg>
            <seg id="p434">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE organized women will wield a great influence in this coming campaign or any movement which they get behind. We need to be able to exer - cise our rights sanely and wisely. These problems should be a challenge to us and we should not fail to give the study of citizenship a definite place in the splendid program set up by the rural homemaker.

            <seg id="p435">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION PREPARING OUR YOUNG PEOPLE FOR MARRIAGE (The following resume was prepared from notes taken from the talk given by Mrs. Mildred Inskeep Morgan) There were two questions in the question box which I am going to take a few moments to answer. The first question is. "Do you think there is more opportunity for cooperation with the parents and children in the farm home 2n in ifthe f a f" 1 ' d ° th ' nk there iS be " er C0 °P er ative opportunity n the farm home. It is so very easy to spread out in an urban situa - tion, but we can keep our families together on the farm and there are more th ngs to do. There is a real opportunity on the farm if we act rightly, it seems to me. There is a more cooperative unit there. How - ever, in the research that has been done it has been found that there is less talking things over between the children and their parents of the rural districts than in other situations. I do not know who made the research but that is the conclusion. The gap between adolescent children on the farm and their parents s greater than it is between urban children and their parents I think it is a matter of our doing our part, perhaps of keeping up our - selves with the things which our young people are doing, to know more about the world in which they are living. I will say more about that tomorrow morning when I talk about the role of the mother in the home. • n \nT Sii ° n IS: " H ° W Can We overc °™ the silly fad of letting little children wear rolled stockings in the winter time'" It depends upon horn much heat you have in the home. It is all right for them to wear less when in the house and more when they go out They are better off in a generally heated house but if the heat in the home is uneven it is much better to have them wear stockings If they have snow suits when they go out it is probably better that they be dressed that way. I do not suppose it could have been done when you and I were that age but you know what fads will do! The con - clusion would then seem to be that it does not matter much if the house is generally heated. Another mother said to me, "What would you do if your son insisted on going without a hat? I know it is wrong and this year I began to harp on it again. Finally he said 'Let's ask a doctor about it and 1 11 do what he says.' I don't know whether he had talked to the doctor before or not. but the doctor said that as long as he started In the season bareheaded and went through without wearing a covering it was all right, but that it was not wise to wear a stocking cap one day and nothing on his head the next day." So let's go to a scientific source about the best thing to do </seg>
            <seg id="p436">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Now let us discuss this matter of preparing our young people lor marriage. This fall I was speaking to young college people in Oklahoma and Texas. One Saturday afternoon I arrived in Dallas, Texas, at the Southern Methodist University. I was met at the station by some young people who said my first meeting that evening was to be with a group of young people who never date at all. I thought that was rather dif - ficult and when they said they wanted me most of all to talk about choosing a mate, that made it even more difficult. But the more I thought about it the more convinced I was that it was more logical perhaps to go to someone who was of an entirely different tempera - ment than trying to find someone of the same temperament and discuss this problem with them. There are factors that are more important than whether your mate and you should be alike, whether you have the same color of eyes, and the same color of hair. Perhaps one should start far back of the ulti - mate time of choosing your mate. It really begins way back there when we are born. Some mothers met me at the door as we came in, and they told me they had come to find out how their two-year-olds could be married off. One mother had a child two and a half years and another four months. I told them they had arrived at the right time. Frankly, I do think we should begin there. I believe that we begin to prepare them rightly or wrongly for the business of marriage almost as soon as they are born. As I know young people, as I converse with them, as they ask ques - tions, as we talk back and forth, it is amazing how much their home situation has influenced what they are doing and what they will do. The relationships of the father and mother in that family have colored what they are doing in that family. Some young people say to me, "No, no marriage for me. I have seen that it didn't work. It has been too hard on mother." Or, "Father has not had a chance. There has been too much dickering in our home." If you find that people have been doing queer and very unfortunate things in the realm of sex, you find as you trace it back with them that the same idea of sex has been a festering sore in the family rela - tionship back of them. I was interested and grieved to find out about some things a number of high school boys had been doing who came to talk to me. "And how," I asked, "how did you happen to begin this thing?" It had no relation to things in a sexual way, yet it was rather terrific. What were they doing? One boy said, "My family clamped down on me on every score but this is one thing they don't know about and I am going to do as I please." I can't tell you what this did to me from </seg>
            <seg id="p437">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION' that standpoint. I don't feel that one is privileged to go in and look up these families but I did look up this family and checked on what they said about the severity of the attitude of their parents, and found that there were dictatorial fathers in these families from which these people came. People's attitude toward marriage or sex is colored by the attitude in that family circle. There are many people who are doing .a fine job of marriage these days. They are perhaps not doing what their parents did but they are doing a fine job of living. The stability of our young well-poised individuals can be traced to the family situation that I spoke of this morning, where the father and mother are cooperat - ing, where the children feel that technically their home is a coopera - tive unit, that home is a place where love exists and the mother is not considered just the housekeeper. The mother is far more than the housekeeper, she is the pivot around which the whole institution re - volves. She should not only be loved but respected. She is not just a handy person to have around when some laundering needs to be done. She is quite a key person in the whole scheme of home life The attitude of the father toward the mother Is important. In a study of 8,000 marriages among educated people it was found that 47 per cent of the marriages were successful when the wife was the dominant figure in the marriage; 53 per cent of the marriages were successful where the husband was the dominant figure- and 87 per cent were successful when it was a cooperative effort between hus - band and wife. I think these figures are significant for all of us and especially in preparing our young people for marriage. Our young people should be able to remember the best in the home situation and carry it on. Our children will observe and absorb many things when very young, and we should not wait to begin this business of training for marriage until it is quite late in life. Our little girl does something we have been trying to get her to do for a long time and we are happy and think she is smart; but the next day she does some - thing abominable and we ask her, "Where did you get that idea?" And she says, "Mother does that," or, "Daddy does it." You see they don't absorb just the good things you want them to get, they absorb just as easily the things you do badly. You may often think that these are your little own pet nuisances and no one need to pay any attention to them; that you are going to keep them your self But that one weakness of yours may be the very thing those little folks will take up first! In a study of students and the kind of homes they would like to make, the same thing is true. They don't want to copy the home where the father Is dominant. They don't like the homes where the </seg>
            <seg id="p438">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE mother is dominant. They want to copy the homes where the coopera - tive idea is dominant. In this matter of preparing our children for marriage there Is the attitude of the parents toward sex itself and toward the sexual rela - tionships between husband and wife. Your thought and emotion around the subje2t of sex has a great deal to do with preparing your children for marriage. If you have the feeling that underneath it is a little base, that it is a little off-color rather than a normal beautiful thing, your children are going to absorb that from childhood on. I was visiting in the home of a friend one day. She was not ready to come downstairs yet, so her four-year old son was entertaining me, and he got a book off the table on "Growing Up", and said: "What do you know, Mrs. Morgan, I was no bigger than that little white spot when I began to grow up, and look at me now!" He knew about grow - ing in his mother's body. He saw nothing wrong in it. He saw only romance. That was just as normal as it possibly could be and will be if we do answer our children's questions about sex wisely. Now a lot of us have children. Perhaps we have not talked to them yet. What are we going to do now? I do not know, only I do know there are some very fine books on the market which are well written. If you have any hesitancy on how to answer their queries, get hold of a good book and then when they approach you, you may just say, "I have found this book and I think it has in it some of the things you would like to know. Perhaps you would like to read it." It seems to me that we must break through because time and time again high school girls come to the point where they stop talking things over with their mothers because they have a sense of shame after having obtained their sex information from some other source than at home. Confidence should be cultivated and respected be - tween children and their mothers. We also need to really think or cultivate patience in regard to sex. We have Inherited an idea about sex that it is not spoken of in best society. We have the idea that it must be suppressed and so we have suppressed it by fear and ignor - ance rather than by psychology. There are not many young people who do not want to look ahead ten or fifteen years to a fine successful life. If you can hold before them a goal of a very happy and successful marriage probably most of them will see the way for them to go. I have watched the throw-back that we have among the young people today and feel that some of them at least are the throw-back of our attitude towards sex. Some of our young people are getting informa - tion that is certainly not the best. I wonder what we are doing about the </seg>
            <seg id="p439">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION books our children are reading. I wonder how many discussions are along the line of books. We discuss many other things but we are fearful of that thing of sex in books. One time about a year ago I had Mr. Morgan's University class out and they were talking about books they had read. "What do you think about such-and-such a book on sex?" It was a very good one of its kind, but most medical men do not consider it sound. Nearly every senior girl in the university received a copy of such a book. The girls were addressed — Mrs. So-and-so. The boys also received them. Some book concern had gotten the senior student list and had sent literature regarding this whole subject, so you see our young people are often innocently getting information from the wrong source, and people like us should get the right information to them. If everyone, however, is being silent on the subject of sex, the young people get rather distorted information. Another thing in a lighter vein is the teasing that we give young people. 1 don't know why we tease, but we do, and in so doing our young people become self-conscious. Why tease our children? It is an important time in the process of growing up to be at ease with the opposite sex, yet we tease them about it, and spoil the whole thing. Can't we see the importance of avoiding just that? Children go through an age in the middle grades when they have no interest in the opposite sex. It is at this age that the boys feel the girls can't do this, and can't do that. And then soon they go to the other extreme and are intensely interested in each other. We have all seen the influence with in a group or clique of girls or boys. You may see three boys who are chums. One of them wants to date the girls but doesn't quite have enough courage. If the three each ask a girl and all go out together they overcome their shyness. By the time they reach this stage of interest in the opposite sex, when they are most impressed, when they need guidance, some people say they would feel much safer in sending the daughter to a girls' camp rather than to a camp where there is a mixed company. I do not think this is sound. Frankly, they need the training in this business of becoming at ease in each other's company. They need to be helped through this silly stage. Our job as parents is to recognize that stage when our child is in it. Get the young people together and give them something to do. It is our job to see that they have a chance for social things. Make it so attractive in your home community by cooperating with a few families that they will have a good time right there. Don't let them go off and pay a big price for movies or dances. If the dining room table is too good to play tennis on, get rid of it. We must give them something to do, games to play, things to do, charades, dramatics, radio — let them play in the same room. Roll up the rugs and let them </seg>
            <seg id="p440">REPOUT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE dance. Give them an interest right then and there. Fill their hands and their mouths with something. Thus they will develop a very fine attitude toward each other. I never go to a high school but that the freshmen group asks ques - tions by the dozen such as when should a girl be allowed to begin dating. People are different, communities are different. The development of young people is different. People have different ideas. Some girls have said, "Just because my oldest sister did not date until she was eighteen my parents won't let me." How do you think a youngster would feel if her father told her she was not to think of boys until she was eighteen, but to keep her mind on books? The father could tell her what to do but he couldn't keep her from thinking what she wanted to. But he is fighting for time. How would you accept it? It is just like this. One young hope - ful said, "If you are exposed to whooping cough and you took it, your family would say, 'Don't whoop! don't whoop!' But I say, 'Tend to the whoop if you have it.' " If they do have it I believe it is ab - solutely essential to let them have group dates. Meet it half way. Bring the group together or work with some of the other parents whom you want in on it. We ourselves must help guide this group. Don't let commercial entertainment do the whole thing. Provide some entertainment so they won't need to spend so much on gasoline and movies. I like to have them have a greater variety of things they take part in themselves that do not take them so far away from home. One mother said, "I am glad Mary is not as silly as Helen, the next door neighbor's child. She is boy crazy. Mary isn't thinking of dating." I met Mary four years later. She really liked the boys in college but they left her alone. She was thinking a lot about boys but she was so timid and so shy in the presence of boys, no boy could get interested in her. They didn't know how to act with her. Don't get me wrong. I don't mean to rush out and push your daughter on all the boys that come along. I mean that we must help our shy daughter to get into a group where she will become more and more at ease with the opposite sex, and we should do the same for our sons. I know older boys and older girls whose lives are miserable failures because they have not made a wholesome relationship with the opposite sex and I find that young people who are indulging in the most petting are not the sophisticates but those young people who have not been asked and who have wanted a date so long that they will do anything on that date so that they might be asked again. They would give their souls for another date. Our new theory is that we give our young people a chance to be together and that we give them scientific information and wholesome </seg>
            <seg id="p441">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION recreation of which we are a part. That is the thing we need in homes, schools, churches, and In communities for it is going to do more to pre - pare people for marriage than anything I know. I said this morning that if we had emotional maturity in young people the world over we would not have one in six marriages go on the rocks. That situation wouldn't exist if we are emotionally mature people when we marry. These marriages start out in high hopes. Marriage demands emotionally mature people. You can't act like a ten-year old and have it hold today. A husband can't throw a tantrum like an eight-year old and get away with it. His family won't stand for It. We must endeavor to prepare our future homemakers ade - quately and this preparation must begin early. "' Every year in our freshman groups we get into a discussion of the relations of men and women. We are all interested in girls having a much more modern view of what they would like to have their home life be than what their home life is at present. The boys haven't thought as much about this as the girls. They have not considered what a cooperative relationship would be in their home. Boys want very modern girls to date but when they marry they want to box them up in four walls. They don't want to let them out, like a canary in a cage. The girls don't like it. They don't know whether love is worth it or not. They want to be growing, but not so many of the men realize it, not so many of the freshmen boys do. One girl said, "Why you won't give us as many free days as the maid has." The wife needs to get away from twenty-four hours of routine with the children, but this young man did not realize nor understand it. He wanted her to sing all day and have things nice for him. But he was not thinking of cooperative relationships. Another thing, this long economic stress has meant postponement of marriage which I am sure some of your children are facing. I have the greatest sympathy with those young people. I think you should do everything you can to help them. You may not have been in the same situation at all. We are not helping the situation much when we say to wait until they finish college. </seg>

The Committee recommended that a summary be presented for each group for the benefit of the members of other groups. The summaries were as follows: HEALTH MRS. WALTER ARMSTRONG Health is an essential for effective rural living, for without health one cannot enjoy the other things. This group felt that the average person is only generally informed on health laws and conditions in the community. We need more definite information to be of real help in the home and the community. The state health appropriation for Nebraska is only $5000. This amount is less for promoting community health than for any other state in the Union. Perhaps we are not in need of as much health work as some other states, but we do have health problems. There </seg>
            <seg id="p444">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE is no state law that will permit the county to set up a health unit if the county is health-conscious. There is no state help available at the present time. Some help has been given by the FERA and PWA, but this is not a permanent program. The passing of the Social Security Bill does set aside a small amount of money that can be used in promoting health in the county. Therefore a county that wants a county health program should take advantage of this opportunity and make the best use of the money. All counties are not ready for health programs, but a few are ready to serve as demonstrations to show what can be accomplished by county and state cooperating. Those that are building toward a county health program can begin through their schools. To do this we need the cooperation of everyone in the district. And when we find someone opposed to county health, we should put forth an effort to convince them of its value. A health program can be helped by select - ing progressive and influential people for the school board who are willing to support such movements. Many people now feel that we have a state law which provides for physical examinations in the schools, but this is only an inspection which may be given by an untrained person. It provides for a check on vision and hearing. This is good as far as it goes, but in no way tells whether the child is physically fit to be in school or not. Most doctors are community-minded and are willing to give a thorough exam - ination for a comparatively small fee. In some communities this has been brought about by having progressive members on the school board. The committee thought it advisable to have some women on the school board. In some communities some public-spirited woman has as her hobby community health and brings about some worth - while improvements. Immunization of children is often thought of as a community prob - lem, but should be at least partially up to the parents. After all, this fee would be much less than a doctor bill. P. T. A., Kiwanis and other organizations give community pro - grams on health. It was suggested that doctors give help at these meetings by informing people about the health conditions of their communities. It was also suggested that the hygiene teacher be on the program and tell what she is trying to teach in the way of health. Another possibility for promoting community health is to cooperate with community organizations. The community should be informed and cooperate with movements such as tuberculosis eradication. Another point stressed was diet and personal health. We can learn to like the foods that are good for us. </seg>

By what process can we make effective thisreligon? By helping to develop religion in the home. By teaching so™ T 5°!* glVe , nesa so that th *y do not fight so much.

We know that family worship has been neglected-asking grace at the table, asking a blessing and thanking God for the daily benefits hat come to us. Our Shepherd dog shows more appreciation and gratitude for his food than some people do at the table. "Do we parents have enough religion in our homes?" No it is lacking In the average home. All were agreed that religion was caught and not taught. Religious training is essential in the home- Sunday School and church are not enough. ,,v T» S T b0Uld "? ourselves ' " Do ™ **ve enough religion in our own lives? Do we think of growth in spiritual life as something confined just to younger years, or is it something we can develop all through </seg>
            <seg id="p446">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE the years?" Children will not grow spiritually in a church in which the older people do not grow. It was decided by the group that it is essential for one to grow or develop in spiritual life. The first contribution of religious life to children must come from their parents. Can we build the kind of home atmosphere that can overcome any outside influence? This cannot be done entirely, but the influence in the home is far greater than outside environment. Children will make contacts with other children who are outside the church. Our responsibility is to help the members of the neighbor - hood and put into the lives of those children not having the right en - vironment the ideals we want to see in our own children. , There should be more cooperation between church and school. In some communities the heads of schools cooperate beautifully with reli - gious organizations. "Does the church in your community make as adequate a contribu - tion to community life as you would like?" In many instances the church in a community is composed mostly of women. Maybe the women have taken too active a part in church affairs, although I be - lieve this failure is due to the fact that the men haven't taken an active enough part. The remedies suggested were that homes should be more spiritual and men should become more interested in church life and not leave the responsibility just for the mother. One of the greatest problems in churches of today is keeping boys fifteen years and over interested in Sunday school. It was sug - gested that this difficulty might be overcome if more good consecrated Christian men would teach these boys. One of the reasons why men do not come to Sunday school and church is because of the leader. There are few really good leaders in rural communities and that is a real problem. Sometimes young people who come back to their rural communi - ties from college find the religion in their home communities too narrow. We need to make a different appeal to young men and young women, for they have a different vision of life. I should like to close this summary by reading a poem. The Kneeling Camel The camel at the close of day Kneels down upon the sandy plain To have his burden lifted off, And rest again. My soul, thou, too, shouldst to thy knees When daylight draweth to a close, </seg>
            <seg id="p447">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION And let thy Master lift thy load And grant repose. Else how canst thou tomorrow meet With all tomorrow's work to do, If thou thy burden all the night Dost carry through? The camel kneels at break of day To have his guide replace his load, Then rises up anew to take The desert road. So thou shouldst kneel at morning's dawn That God may give thee daily care, Assured that he no load too great Will make thee bear. READING MRS. E. E. HARTZ Reading is an essential for effective rural living. The fine address on county and regional libraries by Mrs. Roy Cochran and also the paper read Wednesday morning by Mrs. Murray brought out the objectives of reading. Why is reading one of the essentials of effective rural living? Reading offers opportunity for absorbing and digesting information. Sometimes it is necessary to read things again and again to get the meaning and thought. The radio does not supply sufficient informa - tion. Do you agree with the statement made by A. B. Bryan in an article published in the Library Journal for June 1, 1934, that "the reading farmer is the leading farmer?" Most of us agreed that he was. A farmer must keep up-to-date. Conditions have been such that many farmers have dropped subscriptions to the daily newspapers, but they will take time to read weekly and bi-weekly newspapers which sum up the news. The following quotation has been taken from a Wisconsin bulletin, "Rural Organizations and the Farm Family": "The more organizations a farm family belonged to, the more reading. There is an increase in the number of books read and the number of subscriptions to periodicals. The members of the family wish to keep up-to-date and to seek material for programs and projects and an interest is developed in other things because of exchanging ideas with other folks; they become connected with organizations through reading." </seg>
            <seg id="p448">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE What type of reading material are farm families interested in? There is a very definite vocational need. Also farmers should seek the basic why of government affairs. Newspapers are not sufficient because of political views. It is necessary to seek unbiased opinion through books and other periodicals. Miss Carey stated that libraries are prepared to meet requests but that there have not been as many requests as there should have been. Some suggested sources for read - ing may be found in "Guide to Literature of Rural Life" by the Federal Council of Churches; "Dramatics for Farm Folks," published by the University of Illinois; and "Community Meetings" published by Iowa State College. There is also a recreational need. Periodicals contain book read - ing sections and women form reading circles and learn of books in this way. A county or regional library can be had if voted upon. This would he an advantage even if there is a community or township library be - cause It gives opportunity for a wider collection of books. In many places a town library is supported by taxes. Rural people may obtain service if they pay a charge, which is usually about a dollar This is higher than that charged in larger city libraries, but the service is good and rural people may take out a considerable number of books. LEISURE TIME ACTIVITIES MRS. G. R. EVELAND Planning for the use of leisure time is one of the most important aocial trends at this time. We realize by the large group of ladies that attended our round table discussion and the fine response that many are interested in this topic. The first question asked was: "Why the great interest in leisure time activities?" The reasons are: 1. Greater interest in well-balanced life. 2. Differences in point of view in regard to leisure time. 3. Coming of modern conveniences Ifor the home and machinery which released more time for both men and women. 4. Greater desire to keep self, family and community up-to-date. 5. Desire to be active and not grow old. Our second question was: "How can we get time for leisure?" The responses were: 1. By budgeting time and wise planning. Make the schedule fit the person and not make the person fit the schedule. 2. By cutting out non-essentials. 3. By securing family cooperation. </seg>
            <seg id="p449">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION The third question on what to do with leisure time for the nome - maker herself was divided into three groups: A. Rest and relaxation Reading Listening to music Napping Friendly conversation with neighbors Letter-writing B. Hobbies, Recreation and Creative Work Gardening — indoor and outdoor Handwork as quilting and knitting Collecting poems, recipes, etc. C Education and Culture Music Reading Dramatics Some suggestions on what to do with leisure time for the family were - 1. Reading aloud 2. Playing games 3. Picnics and camping 4. Family hospitality 5. Observation of anniversaries, etc. There was not enough time to discuss community leisure and we recommend that as a topic for future discussions. Suggestions on how to use leisure more wisely are: 1. Choose a contrast to regular work. 2. Follow or develop special interests. 3. Select activities according to seasons. 4 Select a variety which will ofTer to us the newest field of experience. RURAL ELECTRIFICATION - MRS. "WALTER McKIBBEN ™ n T , he RUrSl ElectrIficatl °n Administration has set aside $100 000 - 000 for financing this project. $2,500,000 of this amount has been ear-marked for Nebraska if they want the project. This money is to be loaned to districts in this state for the construction of high lines the purchase of meters and construction of 150 feet of line from high line to house. An effort Is being made to get this distance increased since most Nebraska farm homes are more than 150 feet from the road. The dust nuisance is largely responsible for this greater distance. These loans are to be amortized at 3 per cent over a period of 20 </seg>
            <seg id="p450">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE years. Additional money will also be available for 5 years at 4 per cent for the purchase of appliances. Applications for loans to finance the construction of these lines must be made by either organized cooperatives, or if none exist, by districts which can be organized under a state law enacted seven years ago. A petition for the organization of a district must be signed by at least 15 per cent of the voters at the last general election. If the loan is made, the lines will be built under the supervision of the federal government. In Nebraska we will have three sources of electrical energy — Tri- County, Sutherland, and Columbus projects. But the current from any of these will not be; available for at least one year. Therefore, the government insists that the district have a very definite contract with some concern which can supply current at a reasonable cost for at least one year. The government feels that the cost of this current should be less than 2&lt;f per kilowatt hour. This requirement is the thing which is causing the difficulty. In most cases the price quoted by local companies is in excess of 2&lt;J. One other step which the government is taking to help this move is the setting up of some sort of an organization through which the costs of wiring homes may be held at a minimum. They feel that homes can and will be wired at a cost of $25.00 to $40.00. The work in these districts will all be administered locally, but will be under federal supervision. Reports will be sent to Washington at regular intervals, and in case difficulties are evident, no doubt an inspection and suggestions for improvement will be made. This appears to be an opportunity for agriculture to get electricity at a very reasonable rate. Naturally the cost per kilowatt hour will decrease as the quantity used increases. Therefore, to get the most for one's money, it will be necessary to study the possible uses of current on each farm. EDUCATION MRS. FLOYD COPPLE Education is growth. Education is development. Education is life. Education is the production of useful changes in human beings. Education is a cooperative enterprise. The school, in our judgment, is the biggest enterprise of the state, county, and city. One-fourth of the entire population of 1,377,963 of Nebraska, is going to school. About 100,000 of these are rural boys and girls attending country schools. </seg>

And (11) for every child we must have a community which recognizes and plans for his needs, protects him against physical dangers, moral hazards, and disease; provides him with safe and wholesome places for play and recreation; and makes provision for his cultural and social needs. School officers' convention, Patron's Day, all-day community programs, Parent-Teachers' Associations and community clubs are valuable for bringing about harmonious coopera - tion. ! COOPERATIVE ENDEAVORS MRS. CASSIE RUPP Cooperation, like charity, begins at home; however, our project club women do not wish to stress only project work but are glad to cooperate with the groups of our neighborhoods such as schools, churches, and civic organizations. The group felt that there was a need of making a study of coopera - tion from a business standpoint and the available material for study included the circular on "The Philosophy of Cooperation" by J. P. Lawrence which is in interesting story form; also a new book, "Fresh Furrow" by Burris Jenkins; and the Consumers' Guide, put out by the Consumers' Council at Washington, D. C. In order to build a really effective cooperative, we must leave a part of the dividends in that organization to build it up, rather than to draw out the entire amount. It is especially important that we build our local cooperatives in such a way that they will be closely tied up and a part of the central, national, and also international cooperatives. In the latter there are at least 40 countries represented. Roger Babson says: "Potentially the consumer movement has enough votes, enough money, and enough economic soundness to split things wide open. As the leaders of such crusades well know, if con - sumers ever become organized and go into real action, our present re - tailing, wholesaling and producing systems might be blown to bits." When you Btart your cooperative endeavors, you may feel for a time that it is a hopeless task; however, if you keep everlastingly at it, you will achieve results. I have enjoyed this little poem by Douglas Malloch: "The hills look hard and steep and high And often we behold them with a sigh. </seg>
            <seg id="p453">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION But as we near them level grows the road, We find on every slope, with every load The climb is not so steep, the top so far, The hills look harder than they really are. And so with troubles, though seeming great That men complain, and fear and hesitate, Less difficult the journey than we dreamed It never proves as hard as once it seemed There never comes a hill, a task, a day, But as we near it, easier is the way." CITIZENSHIP MRS. RAY ROSENBAUM All other essentials lead up to this last, but not least, good citizen - ship. Good citizenship embodies all these others. The dictionary gives the following definition: "A good citizen Is one who enjoys the protection of government and in return owes allegiance to that government." In talking about our philosophy on good citizenship, we decided that our ideas of allegiance differed from those of our parents. Some of the suggestions given on good citizenship are: 1. We should use our privilege as voters and all go to the polls to vote, but do our own thinking and not follow that of our husbands or ancestors. j 2. We should investigate the candidates before we vote as to their character and their policies. 3. We should study the political issue rather than the party Parties are needed, however, for tbTer^must be some organization to put forth the group standards. 4. Voters should give thought to the individuals rather than to vote a straight ticket. Quoting Mrs. Gainsforth: "Ignorance is a menace to good citizen - ship." In order to be good citizens, we must instruct ourselves and be informed on the issues of the day so that we may inform our children Training for citizenship should begin at the cradle. There should always be cooperation between schools and teachers and the parents There should be more understanding of the work of the school in regard to citizenship such as the Knighthood of Youth Club and 4-H Clubs. </seg>
            <seg id="p454">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE If parents will cooperate with these organizations, the children would grow up to be better citizens. Both sides of a question should be. presented and then the child allowed to draw his own conclusions on subjects which are within his comprehension and about which he is able to make decisions. If we are going to do anything about it, we will have to pull to - gether and organize all of our efforts and work together in unity. SUMMARIZATION OP ROUND TABLES PROF. H. C. FILLEY So much has been said this morning and this afternoon and it has been so well said that I can't hope in five minutes to summarize all that has been given. About the most striking statement which I have heard today, in fact, which I have heard in recent weeks, is this: "Recreation and leisure time have not only been commercialized, but they have fallen into the hands of the most commercial, the least social, the' most unscrupulous," and the least moral group in our modern society. And the commercial group has turned the period of relaxation, the most fertile of all fields for culture and refinement, into a field of idle dissipation." That is a rather accurate summary of our commercial institutions of relaxa - tion and our commercialized amusements of the present time. I like the movies when they are the type of "David Copperfleld," "Little Women", and "A Tale of Two Cities", and some of the others that follow fine books. Only a relatively small part of the movies that we see are of that type. When we do go to see a fine picture, we generally stay until everything is through and we find that they balance up the fine things with something that is quite different. A year or two ago I went to a movie because part of the scene was laid in the University Stadium, where they were having an athletic meet. Joe Brown, who is a pretty good actor, was the hero. He was supposed to be a budding young scientist, but he was a much different student type than I have learned to know in the past forty years. He fell in love with a girl who was of a very different type than Joe. She wanted to see things doing. They found out that Joe could run and there was going to be a big track meet, so he was to run in the track meet. The girl wasn't treating him right and so he was downhearted and couldn't run. The girl came around to cheer him up and brought along some bottles with contents which are supposed to cheer. She gave him several good drinks. When the track meet started, Joe </seg>
            <seg id="p455">449 NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION began running in the wrong direction, but he finally got turned around In the right direction, and ran one race way ahead of anybody else. This reminds me of a small mining town where I was during the Buckard Gold Rush in 1901. It was a man's world. The rate which was charged saloon keepers was only $2.00 a month, so everything was wide open every hour of the night or day except while the polls were open on election day. On the night of McKinley's second election, everything was wide open after 6 at night when the polls closed. Anybody who has lived under those conditions knows when a man is doing what Joe Brown did, when he didn't even know which way he was going, that he couldn't win a race with a mud turtle. It just couldn't be done. The theatre was filled with young folks who were taking It all in. Some of them believed it, and thought it was the right way to get energetic and win races. Our amusements certainly have been commercialized by this group. What can we do? We can offer something else that will keep young folks busy part of the time. We can't keep them busy 1 all of the time, but we can find some things for them to do. Young folks are essentially active, even if they do like to ride automobiles instead of walking. Young folks who have seen movies and plays like to take part in such things. I believe that it is a good thing to encourage amateur theatricals, or dramatics. I think I would encourage the young ladies and men who want to be school teachers to take a few courses in dramatics as part of their education, and I would encourage the school board to hire teachers who had had dramatics. This would be an extra-curricular activity, and would not take time from school. Young folks who graduated from school and who did not go to college or those who have gone to college and who are back home could have a good time putting on some entertainments and getting ready for them. The proceeds could be put into the school library or the town library, for wholesome entertainment also depends upon reading materials. Another amusement developing in Nebraska is chorus and orch - estra music. We may see the day when In practically every county in the state, we are going to have a band or orchestra. We will have just a lot more music in the open country than we have at the present time. But we must have good leaders. We can tie up all these things — recreation, leisure time, and reading. In 1903 in Bancroft, Cuming county, where I was the superintendent of schools, there was a library which the women's club had started. They were fine women and I wish to pay tribute to them for their work. A great many of the books were children's books, but before I left there were 300 volumes of fiction besides the references books. </seg>
            <seg id="p456">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Religion will also enter into the family program. I believe that I would require every minister who went out to preach in small towns of the state to be a graduate of the College of Agriculture so he would know the common problems of the community. He could also make closer contacts with the boys by that means. He should also take some economics and sociology. These would be far better than being able to read the original Bible in Greek. We should provide the right social life and the right leisure time, some spent in dramatics, music activity, reading, etc., and we should have the right leaders for the group as a whole. THURSDAY FORENOON MARY-ELLEN BROWN, Presiding This session opened with two violin solos played by Carl Steckelberg, -accompanied by Mrs. Steckelberg. The selections were: "Romanza Andalusa" by Sarasate, and "Caprice Viennois" by Kreisler. Demonstration: What's in An Egg? Mrs. Clara Gebhard Snyder 1. The egg is a natural package of perishable food. 2. The package, or the container for the egg meat, is made up of: a. The shell, the most obvious mineral part. The shell is porous, so there can be an exchange of gases between egg and atmosphere. The majority of larger pores lie near the large end of the egg. The color of the shell is determined by the breed of the hen, and bears no relation to the inter - ior quality of the egg or to the color of the yolk. The brown shelled eggs are produced by meat breeds, white shells by Mediterranean breeds. b. The cuticle, or "bloom". This is the thin layer of keratin which lies on the surface of the shell. It can be scratched and marred, and is soluble in milk acids. Eggs if soiled, should be wiped with a dry cloth and not washed until they are ready to be used. c. The shell-lining membrane, which lies just under the shall and adheres closely to it. c. The membrane which holds the egg meat — called the "egg pod." This membrane lies close to the shell membrane, but separates slightly from it at the large end of the egg to form the air cell. 3. The egg consists of white, — a thick and a thin layer, — and yolk, which in turn extends to form the "yolk balancers," or chalaezae. </seg>
            <seg id="p457">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION On the top side of the yolk lies the germinal disc. 4. The utilization of eggs to make a Pineapple Fluff Cake - a. Recipe 6 eggs separated ; 1% cups sugar 1 teaspoon baking powder % teaspoon salt % cup unsweetened pineapple juice 1 tablespoon lemon Juice 1 % cups cake flour b. Procedure Separate white from yolks. For separating eggs have them cold, since fat in yolk Is firm and enables the white to separate easily and cleanly, with least danger of break - ing yolks. For beating, however, have eggs, both whites and yolks, at room temperature. Beat egg whites until foamy, and add salt. Addition of salt at this stage improves volume, flavor and texture of foam and cake. Continue beating egg whites until they are stiff when they will hold their shape, still move slightly In the bowl and still look a little shiny. Add gradually % cup sugar, adding about 2 tablespoons at a time, and beat - ing it in. When this has been added set the resulting foam aside. To the egg yolks add the remaining % cup sugar and the fruit juices, and beat until a thin foam is formed and the sugar is dissolved. To the egg yolk mixture add the flour which has been sifted 4 times with the baking powder. Divide the flour roughly into fourths, adding % at a time, cutting it in with 16 strokes of a wire spoon turning the bowl slightly at each stroke. When all of the flour is in, add the egg white. Fold It in with 35 "folding strokes" of the wire spoon. Pour batter into ungreased large (8 inch) angel cake pan that has been rinsed with, cold water. Bake 1 hour in slow over (325 degrees Fahrenheit) Invert cake in pan and let cool for one hour before removing the cake from pan. Rinsing the pan with cold water and removing cake before it is entirely cold help to keep the. - brown crust on the cake. </seg>

            <seg id="p462">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE THE BOLE OF THE MOTHER IN THE HOME MRS. MILDRED INSKEEP MORGAN I am going to take just a few minutes to try to answer questions. It is not fun to answer questions. It is more fun to discuss them. "Please explain how to impress on a boy's mind how to spend money, to stop spending it, etc." Some things you do without think - ing, and that is what was done in this family. Some things that you do are fine, some not so fine. Children say, "Pardon me" when par - ents say, "Pardon me", because they know what it means. It is the same with money. The children are likely to do what is done in the family. If you are sure you want them to try to spend money, let them buy their things. Have them keep accounts. In the discussion groups which we hold in the Universities every year we ask the fresh - men how many of them keep accounts. They groan when you ask them. Almost all of them say they do. Then we ask how many kept accounts before they came to college. Three out of forty is about the range. They say, "Never have we lied so much as in the three weeks we have been in college." "What suggestions for overcoming smart aleckness?" Do you know why people are smart aleck whether they are six or sixty? They are trying to establish themselves to get a place in the sun. If you can feel your own importance without strutting you do not strut. People don't strut unless they have to. If they have a chance to feel their importance in other ways, they won't. Give the youngsters a chance to have a real part in the conversation at the table, in the church life, etc. I think that will be a real point in making a contribution. In reality that is easier said than done. There is quite a long statement from a person who feels she has not grown up emotionally as she asks, "Can one acquire poise and charm at the age of forty-two?" Yes, one can acquire poise at forty - two. We grow all of the time. The very fact that this woman has recognized the fact that she is not emotionally mature shows that she can grow. I wish we had time for a discussion of this, for there is grist for a whole meeting. No one ever acquires complete adulthood. When you really face those processes in which you are acting like a ten- or fifteen-year-old, you are going to get out of it. The facing of it, the recognition of it, instead of hiding it behind you, helps in over - coming it. "What would you consider adequate allowance for a high school boy and also for a girl?" I can't say because I don't know your family budget. I will go over some of your family budgets with you to see how much you spend on these different members of your family. </seg>
            <seg id="p463">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION From that you can figure your budget and see how much each person is allowed. This specialist which you are going to have will help you throughout the year. Your Clothing specialist will know better than I in regard to the clothing budget. I know some friends in my own home town and I would like to tell you what they are doing. Their children may be different from yours, but they are having their children do everything for themselves except their shelter and food on $15 a month. This is clothing, dating, school supplies, school lunches, every - thing on $15 a month. Some of them are working and are getting good results on $10. That means their mothers are a little more clever in making over clothing. When a gift of clothing comes it is appreci - ated. They say, "My goodness, wasn't this fine?" Any windfalls from aunts or uncles are taken with great gratitude because it means another gallon of gas pr a new necktie. It is that kind of thing that counts. "What makes an adolescent argue?" We need to know the dis - cussion group method in family affairs where we really express our opinions. The people who argue are those who are insecure because people feel they must argue in order to establish themselves. It is said there are few occupations where the wife is really needed. More often she is an economical luxury. You farmer wives should be thankful you are really needed. A professor's wife is not an economical asset. She may be a social asset, but there are a lot of jobs where a wife is not needed. Your job is really classed as an economical asset. That is something to think about. You have enough to do, I am sure. I wonder, though, if we feel our work. Do we feel that these things we are doing day after day count as a partnership, as a whole? Do we see it in the family relationship? Do we see it in dollars and cents? Do we see it in better communities? That is where we need to feel our work. We need to feel it within the family circle. The greatest handi - cap is the fact that the mother alone is educated along these lines. More meetings in regard to family relationships should be held with husbands present. If you of the rural districts are not in partnership within your family circle, no one will be. You have the chance, you are both working at the same thing as husbands and wives. Do you feel you aren't appreciated? Do you feel it is a real partnership? Do you feel that all of the extra money that comes in all goes into farm machinery, or does some go into machinery to make your work better? Do we feel that we are really partners in the proposition? We are not so sure. At other times we feel that we have been left out. We want to be more than housekeepers. We want to be homemakers, for that is the more important job. That is probably the reason why I am not on a farm today. That slipped out unawares. As an end in itself housekeeping is not important. Someone can be hired to do it. It is the atmosphere that you create which is important. It Is the end result of the family relationship. How many things there are to watch </seg>
            <seg id="p464">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE or clear up but the result Is important. If we do feel that there Is something wrong, then our role in the home Is not going as it should. Feeling that we are a part In the economical return of the home is very important. Mrs. Shepard told of an experience during the Farm and Home Week in South Dakota. A party which was held at some distance from the campus was given for the farm women. She found out that a number were not going to the party because they did not have car - fare. They had to ask their husbands for carfare. That impressed Mrs. Shepard. She overheard a woman asking her husband for money for the carefare, and Mrs. Shepard stepped up and said to the husband, "Give her a dollar, it won't hurt you." The husband and wife should work together. My mother asked my father for every cent she had. I could never have stood living with my father, although he was a dear, sweet man and husband. I don't think my mother wrote a check until after my father's death. Now she manages my father's property and money even better than he did. People don't borrow from my mother like they did from him. We need to be partners in the whole thing, whether you are on farms or in the city. Out of all the things you do in your home, decide what is the most important. Research has been done to indicate that a good home is not to be measured in an economical status. It is not to be measured in neatness. Maybe neatness has been your God, keeping the back steps clean, or running to tell the children to be sure to wipe their shoes before coming into the house. The good home doesn't mean parental control. It does not mean that your child must do just what you say. Good homes are measured in terms of human responses. Is your family life rich and stimulating? Or are there terrific jealousies? Even in the best of families there are jealousies. Take two children of the same sex and about two years apart in age and study them carefully. There is terrific competition. It doesn't mean that all children of the same family have all the same brain quality. We have friends who have two boys and a girl. The oldest son and the daughter, the .youngest, are quite brilliant; the middle child is not. What a terrible time he has on both sides. He does have a terrible time in the family and the parents do not realize what he is up against. Make it easy for the ones who are having the hardest job. If they don't show off in school records, give them a chance to show off in some other way. Both of these boys were in athletics. One day when the younger group was playing, the older group had finished batting and the older brother had hit a home run. Someone watching yelled to the younger boy when he was batting, "Hit a home run like your brother did." He turned around to the grandstand and yelled, "I'll hit my own balls, thank you." There is </seg>
            <seg id="p465">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION among families terrible competition. It isn't too bad, it is just normal. Make it as easy and fine as you can. Are we as women growing in personality? Do you feel that you are a richer, finer person than you were five years ago? We all look older. I overheard my husband's family talking about me. They said, "My, how she is aging." Do you have things :ome into your lives which make you a better person? Can you say, "I am a wiser person. I have this that I did not have five years ago. I do this better than I did five years ago. I am more clever. I am a better wife. I am doing a better job of rearing the children. I have the .best garden In the community." Don't let five years go by without having some - thing of which you can be proud. It is human to have the feeling of being wanted, to be needed, to be important. Because we have not grown as people in our own right, and this is especially true of wives, we have to get our sense of importance from someone, else — our hus - bands and our children. That is why we hold on ro our children. It is our need of them and not their need of us that makes us do it. We need to think of children from birth on. You have to have a lot of interests of your own else you do hold on them. Don't think I expect you to to throw them off like cats do or push them out of the nest like the birds do. One woman said to me, "I know what you mean. My son came home from college the other day. He said, 'Mother, I've been offered a summer job. I want to talk it over with you.' I said, 'I can't advise you.' He said, 'Mother, I don't want your advice. I want to talk it over with you.' " I think we need to specialize on something outside of our house and our children. Those are the things that will make you grow. Take up some - thing which you are not sure you can do, but that you want like everything to do, something that you want like everything for your children or your children's children. Whether it be a more careful use of leisure time or whether it be a better interpretation of religion depends upon you. It may be better gardens. I don't know what it is. It is some activity outside of your house and your children, and you will be a better person for them if you grow in your own right. Your husband and your children will be prouder of you if you do grow. They take you too much for granted. Don't pick up clothes, let them lie until the members of the family pick them up themselves. I don't believe that young people and husbands are especially proud of house - keepers and laundresses. You need to organize the family so that the whole group does some of that heavy work. Those things make life better, but need to be out of the way so the family can play, to grow. The reason we must manage people all our lives is because we married the man we did. I have a friend who has a young daughter about seven. This friend does quite a few things outside of her home. She is gone a </seg>
            <seg id="p466">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE great deal of the time. She has questioned whether she should do things outside of her homes as she does. One day she had a little tea party for her daughter. When they have these parties they pretend they are Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Jones and each one has children. This parti - cular day Mrs. Smith (the mother) said to Mrs. Jones (the daughter), "I wonder if I am neglecting my daughter because I am away so much of the time." Mrs. Jones said, "I've wondered about the same thing, but I find when I do something very well my daughter is proud of me." I think that may be true in our own relations. About our attitude toward our husbands, I am sure that we have to do more about women and men working together in this field of family relationships. It is not your job alone, as women, to see that the county has libraries, or better education. You won't get them as fast if you try to get them alone. You can do more by converting your husband and your brother-in-law to these things. They may be con - vinced to serve on committees to call on the school board. They may find time to take you out to lunch and after the lunch they go on about their business and forget you. We have to think together as groups of men and women much more than we do. It is not an easy role, this role of wife and mother in the home. You are a sort of Jack-of-all trades and specialists in all, in order to do it well. We have a friend whom we both laugh about. Sherwood Eddy was once asked to speak at a meeting with my husband. The evening he was to speak he came hurrying in at the last minute with a suitcase under each arm. He was always traveling about, and he said it was like fighting on a dozen fronts at once. You, as women, are still fighting on a dozen fronts and do it well, do it with ease and poise. You have made it possible to live a larger life in the community, a larger life in the family circle of which you are a part. Maybe you don't get credit for it. I don't think that makes much difference, just so it happens. That is your reward to know that it is happening. I don't believe we would trade our position if we could for the positions of other people, but I think we can make a lot more of them than we are doing. You have not finished the role of mother when you have done all you can within the four walls of your home. You have to be sure that everybody in the community has fine standards, that the children of the community have a better place in which to play. It is not just mothering within the walls of the home, it is extending that thing to the edges of the community and to the edges of the state. The following questions asked by the audience were discussed. The problem of an only child. It is nothing like the problem we used to think it was. All examples of bad children were pointed to as examples of only children. There are other children who are middle </seg>
            <seg id="p467">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION children who have lots of brothers and sisters who are just as bad. One mother told me, "Our oldest child was an only child for two and a half years. We are having to do a lot of things to make her know that she is not the center of the stage." To have a little competition is a little stiff. It seems to me that you have to supply for an only child some natural competition, some of the natural sharing and opportunity of being with other children. If it means leaving the washing and taking Sally to play, you have to provide this thing of -playing with somebody else. It is that kind of thing we have to share with someone else which happens when the child is alone in the family. It means more planning and talking things over; when the child goes to school he finds he is not so important as at home. He does not have his par - ents on the side lines to tell him how marvelous he is. We have to talk things over. Keep the channel of communication very full and open between yourself and your child. We can do this if we are clever enough. We can make those contacts which are necessary, for I think we need to do this sharing business with the only child. I believe it can be done. I know of many families where they had one child and found it impossible to have another, so they have adopted children and it has been a very fine hobby. THURSDAY AFTERNOON At one o'clock a mass meeting of all organizations was held. The following talk was given at this meeting. UNDERSTANDING OUR YOUNG PEOPLE MRS. MILDRED INKEEP MORGAN ) The thing I am speaking about this afternoon is Understanding our Young People. I want to talk about the need of adolescents. When I was studying in New York a long time ago I came to know a young Southern girl who had two younger brothers. She was always a good friend with the younger brother. They wrote to each other quite often. He would tell about the next older brother. He said his brother was "adolescin 1 worse than ever". We feel that way about young people. We have been brought up to feel that during the period of adolescence, this high school period, we aren't supposed to understand our children. One thing about adolescence which we need to face is that it is really a normal period in the growth of people. The children are with the parents less than before. They have more of a chance to make mistakes than if they were under the guidance of the parents. If you have done a good job of rearing children up to adolescence you will find they are making a fine job of living today. If you made any mistakes in rearing children, it will creep out. It is just a period </seg>
            <seg id="p468">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE where all the training which the child has comes out. We see it much more plainly then. If you as parents have held a hand on your chil - dren without giving them the reason why all the way along, then you find that this is the period when they are taking the bit in their mouths. A young freshman in the University said recently, "It is just terrible not to ask Daddy and Mother what to do in every situation that comes up. There are some things I have to write about, and there are some things I have to decide before I get a letter back. I tell them exactly the decision- 1 have made." This child is still in the Kindergarten and yet she is turned loose in the University and it is her parents' fault instead of her own, so our training, whatever it has been until adoles - cence, is sure to come out at that time. It is a period of coming into your own, standing on your own feet, making your own decisions. A mother says, "My boy stays home at nights." Another one says, "Thank goodness, our girl is not boy crazy," or "My son's only sweet - heart is his mother." By the time a boy gets to be nineteen he should be looking in other directions for sweethearts. We have the feeling that the more closely we can keep our children, the better off we are and the better off they are. The training should be to launch children on their own so if you are suddenly taken away they could go on at eigh - teen. I think we can do it but I think many of us are not doing it. It is too much fun to feel like a God in their lives. Maybe this boy who stays home and reads every night, the boy who stays at home and works by himself all the time, does it as a substitute for the activity with the group. They try to satisfy themselves with high grades at school. They don't get over in their own age group. They take it out by being by themselves. We do not force our children on other groups when it is too difficult but we make it easy for them by trying to make them a member of the group. There are college people who feel that their life is somewhat of a failure because they are not popular with the other sex, but I am saying that because of your feeling about sex itself you have postponed their datings until they are fearful of the whole business and they make it difficult to establish a wholesome relation with the opposite sex. I am sure they need to play under guidance, they need our help. They need a chance to know each other in groups. Have them think through their relations together. They need to talk it over together under guidance. Another thing we need to think about adolescence today is that times have changed con - siderably since we were adolescents. Some say their parents throw it up to them in this way, "I didn't spend that much money on this when I was that age. I didn't start dating until I was eighteen." A girl at a camp at Lake Okiboji expressed her feelings when she said, "I would give anything if my mother were just a little bit modern, </seg>
            <seg id="p469">XEURASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION tout not as modern as some mot hers. It -would make it a little bit easier." I think that is the feeling they have about a lot of us. Research has shown that farm people, boys and girls on farms, are not as close to their fathers and mothers as are the urban children of adolescent age. You may be the people of whom this is not true, you leaders of agri - culture in the state of Nebraska, but it is true in general of farm par - ents and their children. Times have changed since we were our children's age. Do you realize that in 1900 there were 8,000 auto - mobiles in the United States and today there are over 120,000,000. Of course this means that money is spent for gas, for movies, and for food after movies. Can you see what it does? If there are 120,000,000' families having cars, and your boy is not allowed to use your car, it is just as though you cut off his leg. It really is. He is handicapped,, no doubt. What do you say to this? It has revolutionized the whole - business. When I was a youngster we were going some distance when we went ten miles to a party. We could not get out of the range of relatives. I had to be very careful at a party because some relative might tell my mother. There was some relative at all the parties I attended at the time of my youth. Our whole system of relations is changed because we can cover such a long distance in such a short time. It is the speeding up that makes a difference in the way we feel toward each other. We speed up everything we do. We have a sense of speed in relations of boys and girls together. When you and I first started to attend the movies, they were not what they are now. In the first movies there were queer things that accompanied them. After the thing was over there were some words which told what they had said to each other. There was no stimulation in the movies for the young people then as now. Look at what we have now, the excellent tone we have. There is stimulation of both eye and ear. Movies have more influence than anything we can say and believe. Our grand - mothers never saw Clark Gable make love on the stage. The young people think they should do the same thing as they see in the movies. We are letting them go to football games and yell at the top of their lungs. We let them go to the movies. And you and I are not helping them to do anything more natural. You and I have a job and I be - lieve you people on farms have a better chance to do something with them if you start with them young enough. I believe in communities we could create much amusement, a band, or supervised games, folk dancing, all sorts of hobbies, not passively doing the stunt. All sorts of subjects would interest people. We have to start young, catch them at the age of eight years of age. You can start with people at eight years and do a good job of it. There is an awfully good article in Harper's on bad music. It was awfully hard on the neighbors. It did not sound like music some of the time but it afforded that boy somthing to do. I think we could have community singing if we started young enough to interest people in it. Young people need </seg>
            <seg id="p470">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE to have a chance to do things together. Get them interested in cooking' out-of-doors. Don't make all the sandwiches in the kitchen. They like it much better. Adolescent boys and girls want to be around each other, but they do not have a notion what to do. They will in - dulge in petting if they are not creative enough to have anything else to do. One. young man said in a gathering of young boys and girls not long age, "If you really want to do something, find some place where ■we can play and you will find that the walls of the place will be crowded out. Let us help you plan what to do." He finished his statement by saying the reason why there is so much necking today is because it is about the only cheap sport left. That boy is not far from right. We have allowed commercial amusement to take the field. We have done very little constructive work in helping young people by giving time and places to play because a lot of them don't know how to play. Radio has done much the same thing as the movies have done. You can get programs from all parts of the globe. You can get news from the place where it happened. Half of the young girls I know are trying to sing the "blues" because it is the thing to do. It is terrible. If we eternally criticize this generation they in turn go on the defensive. It is the thing to find suggestive, constructive things to do. Talk things over with your children and with the children of your neighbors. You say you can't talk it over with the family, all they do is argue. They ought to see your side. They know what you should do and you are not sure they know all of it. One boy in a group said, "How can you corner your parents and talk things over with them when they are always so busy?" Another boy in the group said, "I help my mother with the dish washing, especially when I have some - thing to talk over, and when you have her tied to the dish pan, she cannot get away for at least fifteen minutes. You can get in a great lot of conversation in fifteen minutes." It is too bad that our lives seem so crowded that our young people do not find a chance to discuss things. Another one said, "I strike Dad after the Sunday dinner when he is all fed up and comfortable. About the only time he relaxes is on Sunday afternoon." They know how to work it. They know when we are in the best mood. When they try and don't get to first base they go to someone •else. We can't be shocked. We can ask took many questions. We have to wait patiently. We cannot preach, rather, I think, you and I have to think back when we were that age. Think back with a glow. You think back when you were a young man, how the first time you asked a girl for a date. Think when you wanted to wear your Sunday trousers to school because you liked Susie Brown. Our young people are trying to find their way over the same path but with much more stimuli. They don't need our preaching but our understanding. If you are a woman think back to the first time the neighbor boy put his arm around your waist. You thought him very daring. You </seg>
            <seg id="p471">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION didn't tell your mother about it. I think children today need our help. They have more stimulation today. One boy said to me, "Mrs. Morgan, you're behind the times. Girls say you have to let the boys neck or you don't get another date. The boys think they have to kiss a girl good-night on the first date. If they don't do it, the girls think something is wrong and don't like it." It isn't the thing they want to do, but they want to be popular with the opposite sex and we have not helped them to think through the fine way of saying good-night, so they are doing the thing they think is right. Give them a chance to think it through. Then in regard to money, they need a new sense of money. They need to know what money is for. You may say, "In our family we haven't had any for the last year." Help them earn it as well. Let them take the place of the hired man. Let them do things to help. Give them a chance of tilling their own soil or of raising their own live - stock. I think there are more chances of doing that on the farm than there are on urban communities. In this connection I always think about my husband telling the story of his chickens. He raised some chickens and had made plans of how to spend the money. When he sold them his father took the money away from him. My husband's father has been dead for years but my husband has never forgotten. Young people need to experiment with the use of money in buying their own clothes. They need a chance of making a choice in their own clothes and knowing that they can't spend money twice. They will be much wiser than if they tried to get money out of you. A young high school boy was not allowed to get his own shoes. His mother went with him. He wanted to go alone. He will soon have to shop for everything he buys for himself and if his mother is wise she will let him start now. Children need to be set on the road to self - correction when they are babies and there is no doubt they will keep in. that road if you keep them doing it. The thing we are to remember is that times have changed. "We may need to do some studying about how they have changed. Family relationships have been left entirely too much to the women. We need to work together as husbands and wives, as fathers and mothers and children, if we expect to improve very much. You need to have respect for the things we say. We can't do it alone, either the man or the woman. We need to do it together. We need do a lot of study on the subject. We need to make it easy for them to talk things over with us. We have to have more confidence in their judg - ment and their goodness. They need a place to play, something that has your approval and that does not cost too much money, and finally be the kind of person you hope that they will be. You must not go into the example business, but be the finest kind of person you can possibly be and keep this path of communication open between your children and you. </seg>

We read in the Agricultural Extension News, the little paper that comes to Jim, about the dates for Mothers' Vacation Camps: Neligh, July 11-14 Chadron State Park, July 18-21 Brewster, July 25-29 ■■ Curtis, Aug. 1-4 You remember meeting my nice neighbor, Mrs. Gray. Well, she came over one afternoon and said, "Jane, let's go to Mothers' Vacation 'Camp." Just In fun, I said, "All right, let's declare a holiday." Then she told me she really was serious and said she would go if I would. Mr. Gray could take us to the park and Jim could come and get us. So that's the way it started. We got up at four o'clock Thursday. There were so many last minute things to do. The Grays came about nine o'clock and when we got bur bedding and suitcases packed in, we were pretty well loaded. The park is about 100 miles from here. We had lunch in Chadron and arrived at the park about 2:30 p. m. There's a main office on the grounds, so we went there, registered, paid our $3.25 and left our 6 eggs and 6 potatoes. Miss Brown of Lincoln, who was in charge of the Mothers Camp, greeted us and made us feel welcome. A camp helper shewed us our cabin. Ours had two rooms; we had the south end and Mrs. Coe and Mrs. Day of Perkins county had the north end. They were lovely and we had so much fun with them. They came 200 miles. I took some pictures with Jim's camera, and when we have the films developed, I'll send you some. We hung up our clothes, made our beds and were visiting away when the six ladies in the cabin next to ours came to call. They were from Morrill County. We chatted awhile and then everybody gathered in the park pavilion. I felt a little lonely at first, but Mrs. C. O. Bruce jand Mrs. Alice Salama Ames of Lincoln had us play some get-acquainted </seg>
            <seg id="p473">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION games and soon Miss Brown blew the whistle and we lined up for "eats". Tables were outloors in the shade and meals were served -cafeteria style. Everybody got acquainted and sometimes we sang while we sat around the table. How we did eat! It was nice to eat someone else's cooking. Everyone washed her own dishes. There ■were thirty-five ot us and groups ol about eight washed at a time. Mter Bupper Mtoa Brown expMnea the camp EiogTam.

I had. the part ot a sophisticated college girl. We also had some training in publicity. I never realized there were so many ways to advertise a thing. The two sides had a contest seeing who could think up the most and best publicity. Of course, we didn't have time to learn our parts, so we read them. For 25£ each we each bought a round sheet of copper and under the direction of Mrs. C. O. Bruce, we hammered it into shape with wooden molds and a wooden hammer. I made two trays. I'm going to use one for a nut dish and the other I think I'll give to Mary for Christmas. v On Friday afternoon we were given a tea at the Chadron Teachers' College. The program was lovely. Summer school was in full swing and the girls were gracious hostesses to all of us. The tea was in the girls' dormitory. I must not forget to tell you about the book reviews Mrs. Bruce gave. She is a very restful sort of person. She reviewed "Let the Hurricane Roar" by Rose Wilder Lane. It's a story of early pioneering. "100,000,000 Guinea Pigs" by Kallet and Schlink made us want to be a little more cautious about the things we buy; "Green Light" was a lovely characterization story. After breakfast the first morning everybody became better acquainted on hearing each one tell about my first , it could be my first anything. Many and varied were the subjects chosen. I .told about my first boat ride. At this period on the second morning inspirational ideas were </seg>

Friday evening was the night of the Hobo Hike. Miss Genevieve "Woodman, one of the camp crew, directed activities. Everybody dressed as "hoboish" as she could and Mrs. Ames gave many demonstrations on how make-up can change a person's looks. There was much merri - ment as the ladies viewed each other in the role of hobo. Dignity was forgotten as with lunches in paper sacks and hung on a stick over the shoulder, we started out. A scavanger hunt added to the fun. Hobo stunts called forth a lot of originality. Prizes were awarded to the three most "hoboish" looking hoboes. Your daughter got a second prize for the next best hobo. It was a tooth brush. Saturday night after our Nite o' Comedy, we all went with Mrs. Bruce on a hilltop just back of the cabin and had a very inspiritational talk about the stars. I was awed and impressed again with the immensity of it all and the Power that can control such a universe. This was our last night in camp and after the camp crew had bid us "good night", we campers decided it would be fun to wait a short time and then have some fun with the crew. One ring leader of the bunch suggested kidnapping them and giving them rides on the play equipment on the children's playground, so we did. Such a noisy, gay bunch of women as we were and the crew enjoyed it, too; at least they were good sports. Sunday was visitors' day. Families began to arrive early and we campers packed our things. Mr. Newton Gaines of the Extension Service gave the talk at the Worship Service. His topic was "The Abundant Life." After dinner we all said "Goodbye" to everybody. We had be - come pretty well acquainted and hated to say goodbye, but it was fine to be going back to our homes and families, too. Mother, I have the best idea. Next year you come and go with me. I'm sure you'd enjoy yourself, and it would be such fun to go together. What a long letter I've written and all about the Vacation Camp! I'm so full of it right now that I had to tell you about it. I found the children and Jim just fine. They seem to have gotten along very well without me, but they gave me the heartiest of welcomes home. On the last page of our camp program was this quotation which I'm going to try and remember: "A placid face and a gentle tone will make my family more happy than anything I can do for them." My best love to you and Dad. JANE </seg>
            <seg id="p475">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION part m 4-H CLUB WORK Interest in 4-H Home Economics judging has grown rapidly.. The training of judging teams has been one of the important activities of •the 4-H Club work. The Home Economics Section of Organized Agri - culture has considered it a worthy use of $75.00 of their allowance to foster this work. Each year an amount has been allowed on the expenses for the trip to the National Club Congress for the eight high scoring individuals who won championship in Home Economics Judg - ing at the State Fair. The eight girls who represented the four judging teams this year are as follows: Baked Foods Alberta Schmidt Marian Shannon Canned Foods Ramona Wood Doris Crawford Clothing Fern Morlok Helen Fredricksen Girls' Room Frances Weides Irene Conner At the National Club Congress in Chicago these girls entered judging contests which aim to train girls to recognize standards in quality, to weigh values of importance, and to give their reasons for their plac - ings. We are very proud of the record these girls made. In fact, we are proud of the record made by the entire delegation representing Nebraska in the 4-H contests. Upon their return from this trip all of the girls wrote interesting letters of appreciation for the assistance from this organization in making their trip possible. Because of lack of space to print all of the letters in this report, one of the eight has been selected as typical. The following is the story of the trip written by Irene Conner from Lexington, Nebraska. The story shows what the trip includes for those who win this honor and privilege of going to the National Club • Congress. ■ Story of My Trip to Chicago My teammate in 4-H Club and I left Lexington, Nebraska, Saturday morning, November 30, all excited about the big trip to Chicago. As </seg>
            <seg id="p476">REPO"T OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE neither of us had ever traveled far by train before, we had our first experience of sleeping in a berth. The constant roar and the chug of the engine were very annoying. Then when the train stopped and started, it gave quick jerks making one think he was going out of his berth. Entering Chicago, we could see from the train some of the slum districts which gave me a bad picture of Chicago. I was greatly impressed by the fifty-mile tour of the city of Chicago. Outstanding places to me were: Lincoln Park, the largest one in Chicago, the ghetto or street market, Chinatown, the Chicago Stadium, and the Lakeside Drive. All judging contests were held the first of the week so that con - testants would be relieved from their work. When my teammate and I were told of our winning first in the girls' room contest, we could hardly believe it. It seemed too good to be true. Because of this victory we were given the honor of talking over the NBC network. We were also entertained at luncheon by the Chicago Kiwanis Club and had our pictures taken many times. We visited the Palmer House through the courtesy of Sears, Roe - buck and Company and were their guests at luncheon one day. For entertainment they showed us interesting pictures of the new book, "Under the 4-H Flag". While in the city, we were also guests of Wilson and Company, one of the largest meat packing plants in Chicago. As they were cele - brating "Thomas E. Wilson Night", their program was varied, con - sisting of. movies, dances, plays, readings and musical numbers. One evening the entire delegation paraded in the arena of the International Livestock Exposition. To me the most interesting buildings we visited were the Field Museum and the Planetarium. The Field Museum contains prehistoric exhibits, of which the cave men were the most interesting. The animals were placed in such a natural position that it seemed as if one were really in the country from which they were taken. We were told that it would take four or five days to see everything which was in this museum. I was astonished at the Planetarium, which reproduces the heavens in motion. So complete is the illusion of the circular enclosure that one soon feels he is sitting in the open spaces looking at the sky. I marveled at the Grand Ballroom at the Stevens Hotel, the largest hotel in Chicago, where the club members' annual banquet was held. </seg>
            <seg id="p477">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION The International Harvester Company gave us a very educational tour through their plant showing us how parts for tractors are made. The Chicago Mail Order House Company showed much hospitality when they were our hosts at breakfast one morning and also showed us through their plants. The style show under the direction of Jane Alden presented by them was very interesting. One afternoon was left open for shopping. During this time the Nebraska delegation visited Marshall Fields, the largest store in Chicago. The night we started home proved very exciting as our train was detained by an accident. A gas tank which had fallen off a freight train ahead of us derailed our engine. Of course we could not go on immediately, but that fact did not bother us because we were still thinking of the good times we had been having. I don't know when I have spent a more worth while week. To all 4-H club members who have not received this trip, I say to try a little harder so that you, too, may share an enjoyable week. </seg>

The hobbies on exhibit consisted of quilts, pillow tops, stones, fancy - work, tatting, netting, crocheting, aprons, cookies, canning, scrapbooks, recipe files, etc., etc. A copy of Mrs. Evertson's talk follows: HOBBIES AXD PASTIMES MRS. FRANK EVERTSON The subject which we are to discuss this morning is Hobbies and Pastimes. And what an interesting subject it is! I am sure that it is a subject near and dear to each one of us and that you are all anxious to tell us about your hobby. We are going to give you that opportunity, but first let me tell you about mine. Some people think that they have no hobby, but upon investigation, we discover that they do — they just call it by a different name. First let us define hobby. One definition in the dictionary says "a favorite pursuit". To my way of thinking there is a difference between hobbies and pastimes. There are a lot of things we enjoy now and then for short periods of time, that we would not choose if it were left to us to make a choice. This I call a pastime. Hobby conveys the thought of choice. In our infancy we learned that a hobby was a wooden horse on wheels or rockers, painted to resemble a real live horse with tossing mane and flying tail. We derived great pleasure from riding our hobbies. Surely you remember. Well, the same definition fits today. A hobby is something we enjoy, really like to do. If there is manual labor connected with it, we do not count it work, but joy, because we relax and forget our troubles as we go galloping on our hobbies. Our hobbies should not only bring joy and satisfaction to our - selves, but they should also be the means of helping to make other people happy. Because we are so different in our tastes for other things, we </seg>
            <seg id="p481">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION naturally have many subjects for hobbies or pastimes. Your hobby might bore me. Likewise my hobby might be distasteful to you. Now let us name over some hobbies which were suggested by the members of the Mothers' Vacation Camp at Curtis. I feel certain that those of you who have been calling your hobby by another name will find it in this list. (List was then read.) Now, friends, whatever you like to do best, whatever is most restful to you, call that your hobby. Don't put it into the cellar or attic, but use it and develop it. Oh, yes, it will develop and grow if nourished by the proper food. Let me show you how a certain hobby grew. This particular hobby I call Diary. He is one of the most difficult hobbies because he requires daily care if he is to grow into a prize - winning steed. But he is worth the effort, I assure you. He is now twelve years old and improving with use, growing bigger and better as the years go by. As a tree shows its growth in years of drouth and in years of plentiful rainfall by its rings, so a hobby diary has a tale all of his own. He must have been born in a bad year, judging from his size. Then in depression years, a ten-cent note book was used; in better years, one bound in leather and costing much more. Because your hobby balks and bucks, don't trade him off or turn him out to die. I made as many attempts to keep a diary as I did to read Ben Hnr before I succeeded. I tamed that broncho and he is now a pet - and-trick horse. When Dad and the children want to know what date, what did we do, where did we go, etc., I refer the question to hobby Diary and he rarely fails to do his trick. Do I have more than one hobby? Yes, indeed. It's a foolish showman who has but one attraction to show and no reserves in the rear. In late years, I have acquired a runty colt which I call Clippings. Some day when I am able to build a bigger and better stable, I hope to see him stand eighteen hands high. Do you want to see him? Here is a photograph. (Rodgers cook book, poems.) Another twenty-year old hobby I have is called Round Robin. He is a partnership hobby — white with black markings. He does not thrive in one pasture, but changes to different ranges as many as eight times in one year. In fact, he is a traveller of wide experience. He can travel much more cheaply than can his masters; that is the reason for his existence. He transports himself from one range to another for the small sum of six cents. He rides the fastest trains and carries many kinds </seg>
            <seg id="p482">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE of messages. His western range is in Kimball county, Nebraska, and his eastern range in south-eastern Missouri. His summer range is in the north and his winter range in the warm and balmy south lands. He was born in Kirksville, Missouri, in late summer of 1915, and became the property of seven teachers' college students and their landlady. Five of the students have married and now have families. Two have remained single and have careers. Our landlady is now confined to a wheel chair and how she enjoys Round Robin and his messages. He sojourns longest in her pasture and is reluctant to leave. We expect the third, yes, the fourth generation to enjoy Round Robin. In the stall next to Round Robin stands his mother, Friendship Letters. She is almost as old as I, but hale and hearty and as eager for a journey as her famous offspring. She carries messages to and from my first school teacher, to former pupils of my own, to distant relatives and friends, letters of condolence and congratulation. Friendship letter, because she is smaller and requires less space than Round Robin, travels for half price when she rides the rails and for ten cents when she boards the fastest air liner to any point in the U. S. A. Quilts is the name of a pinto pony in my stables. He has more spots than a leopard and each spot has a legend connected with it. This bit of blue is a piece of baby's first rompers. This red Mary wore when first she went to school. This stripe is a piece of Johnny's first shirt "just like Dad's". The story is endless and I live over each incident as I sew the tiny stitches. Time passes swiftly. I must blanket and stable Quilts and take up the regular housekeeping duties, but as I work at unpleasant tasks, I am thinking of my hobby and inventing short cuts so that I can exercise Quilts again at the earliest possible moment. Quilts is broad of back and many times I take a friend with me on a jaunt. We sew and chat as we gallop along. (A discussion by the women of the various hobbies which they had, followed.) Oh, how I wish for a camera to record the happiness on your faces! Time has escaped through the window as we went for a canter on our hobbies. Some of us left our work unfinished this morning in order to come here and exhibit our hobbies. Some of us had aches and pains and wondered if we really could get ready and go. These aches and pains were forgotten, weren't they? Yes, all our worries and cares have been cast aside and for over an hour we've been transported to another world where happiness reigns supreme. Now, take your hobbies home and repair them. Give them a fresh </seg>
            <seg id="p483">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION coat of paint and plenty of exercise. You'll be happier and, your family .and friends will be benefited. How many of you are helping your children to get started on a hobby? Does a child need a hobby? Certainly he doesj I know a juvenile stamp collector, a chemist, a poet, a musician. ! They pass many profitable hours pursuing their hobbies while their, friends are killing time on the streets or reading "trashy" literature! In this changing age, when so many of the old ideas are being cast aside, when organized labor says that forty hours per week is suffi - cient for a man to toil, what are we homemakers going to do? Are we going to keep on at the old pace and calmly recite the old adage, "Man toils from sun to sun But woman's work is never done." Don't deceive yourself into thinking you are cheating when you snatch a quiet hour for rest and recreation. If you take a whole day off now and then, it is not for yourself alone that you're doing it; your husband and children will appreciate you the more for it. ■ If you do not have your work arranged so that you can have at least two hours per days for something besides the regular work of a house - hold, you need to reorganize your schedule so that you may have some time for the things that you are most wanting to do. Don't put it off any longer! Look about you and find a remedy! I speak from experience. In our family it has always been con - sidered an impossibility to go to Sunday School, a distance of fifteen miles. For years I accepted this as a fact and stayed home or went visiting. Every Sunday morning an inner voice said, "You should take the children to Sunday School." Another voice whispered, "You could never get to a ten o'clock service." In desperation, I determined to try. It meant doing a few more tasks on Saturday, which was already a busy day, but the children cooperated splendidly and we overcame the obstacles. For five months we have attended and have been absent only three times, and that was because of bad weather. I hope I have been able to help some of you appreciate your hob - bies more. If heretofore you have not owned a hobby, I hope that we have interested you sufficiently to arouse in you a desire to be the possessor of one or more hobbies. A hobby helps us to develop self - confidence and poise and will be the means of your becoming a better homemaker. There is no higher calling. In the women's section in the afternoon Mrs. Clay Wallace, who </seg>
            <seg id="p484">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE lives on a farm near Lexington, told of her trip to Columbus, Ohio, to attend the National Rural Home Conference and the American Country Life Association. She said: ECHOES FROM AMERICAN COUNTRY LIFE MEETING MRS. CLAY WALLACE I was invited to attend the second Rural Homemaker's Conference held at Columbus, Ohio, September 19-22. We left Lincoln September 16 about 2 p. m. in Miss Brown's car. We drove to the home of Miss Evelyn Wolph near Nehawka. She joined us and we went on to Union where we met Mrs. Ernest Overton whose home is near Nebraska City. We crossed the Missouri river at Plattsmouth and journeyed eastward through Iowa to Burlington. From here we went through Peoria, Bloomington, Champaign and Urbana where we stopped for a hurried view of the University of Illinois .campus. It is a beautiful campus, with fine big trees, magni - ficent buildings, the whole campus very compact and imposing. We spent the first night at a tourist camp and the other nights at tourist homes and found rooms that provided all the necessary com - forts such as good clean beds, bath, fresh air, etc. The second night we spent in Indiana not far from the Illinois-Indiana line, and ate our breakfast at Indianapolis. Both mornings we were on the road before six and we drove till dark or a little after. Each of us took a turn at driving so it did not become tiresome to any of us. About twenty miles east of Indianapolis we passed the birthplace of James Whitcomb Riley, but it was not open to visitors so we did not stop. We reached Columbus about 4 p. m. Following a map of the city, we had no trouble finding the campus of the Ohio State Uni - versity where the meetings were to be held. We arrived in plenty- of time to register and receive our room assignments. Our rooms were just across from the campus within easy walking distance. The second National Rural Home Conference was sponsored by the American Country Life Association which meets every year in one of the land grant colleges. September 18 marked the sixty-second anniversary of the Ohio State University as a land grant college. During that time only three men have served as president. Miss Grace Frysinger, from the Extension Service of the U. S. De - partment of Agriculture, Washington, D. C, presided at the meetings. Twenty-two states were represented and 377 were registered for the conference. </seg>
            <seg id="p485">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION The meeting was opened by singing "America, the Beautiful". Pictures to illustrate the song were thrown on the screen. The pictures were not distinct, however, because there was too much light In the room. Dr. Carl C. Taylor, president of the American Country Life Asso - ciation, was not present until later so did not extend his greetings at this time. Dr. George W. Rightmire, president of the Ohio State University, gave an address of welcome. He expressed the idea that it was very appropriate that Ohio State University should be host to this organiza - tion because the federal government through Ohio State University has carried on a very constructive program during the sixty-two years. He introduced the subject of "Population Movement" which was to be the topic under consideration in i the conference which followed the Rural Home Conference. In her remarks, Miss Frysinger expressed satisfaction that in this, the federal government was not asked to do anything, but it was a challenge to the homemaker herself who wished not only to enjoy the privileges, but to share these advantages with others. The theme of this conference was "Services Essential to Effective Rural Living". Each of eleven different subjects was presented by a homemaker from the different states in a five-minute talk. Later in the day, after lunch in fact, these same eleven subjects were discussed in different groups, each member of the conference choosing which group she wished to attend. When the entire group reassembled, the subject was again presented by the discussion leader who summarized the points presented in the discussion group. Each talk was to be based upon experience. I The subject of Health was presented by Mrs. R. E. Rayle, South Carolina. "He who has health has hope, he who has hope has every - thing." Pellagra is a disease prevalent in her state. It generally fol - lows a depression and is due to inadequate diet. Yeast is used to fight it and this was furnished by the Red Cross. They have a nurse in every county. She stated that Louisiana is the only state to give inoculation against diphtheria. Tests for tuberculosis are given to blacks and whites. Some work to combat disease has been done through hospitals on wheels. To guard against hookworm, they urge care of drinking water. Mrs. A. G. Bookwalter of Ohio, in presenting the subject of Read - ing, told of a library trailer which visited county high school towns. They raised the money to provide this trailer service from serving chicken dinners and volunteer service. The trailer was equipped with </seg>
            <seg id="p486">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE shelves. From $3 to $5 were received from each school for the use of" books. A rate of 2tf per mile was charged for the distance traveled. Prom 350 to 500 books were carried in the trailer from the State Library at Columbus. More than 11,000 books were loaned. This service tided over an emergency and created an increased desire for the use of books. "Leisure Time Activities" was presented by Mrs. E. B. Allen, Mississippi. She emphasized the fact that here we are with something in our hands if we want it and yet, what are we prepared to do with that extra hour or hours which we have longed for? Will we fritter them away or will they be an open door to a world of new experiences and interests? With no money to provide outside attractions, their com - munity had worked to develop talent in music through singing and the use of various instruments. To some extent the radio was used also. They worked to encourage the writing of original plays and putting them on in the community. Glee clubs were invited to visit the consolidated schools. Household arts such as rug making, needle - work, quilt making, painting, and other handcrafts were provided for the needs of those who were interested along these lines. Mrs. H. S. K. Bartholomew, Indiana, presented the subject of Housing. She stated that "There is nothing too good for the farm home." Up to this time labor-saving equipment had been considered a necessity in carrying on the general farm work, but a luxury within the house, and only those who could afford luxuries had this equip - ment. Electricity has brought to the farm home the greatest change for bettering conditions. The federal government through the National Housing Act seeks to provide means whereby improved conditions may be made available to all. It does not advocate unwise spending, but a very careful planning of changes. The subject of Electricity was presented by Mrs. Oscar Conrad, Wisconsin. She stated, "No one needs or can make as much use of electricity as the farm family." Through the use of electricity one is assured of increased convenience and satisfaction. Whatever diffi - culties may be apparent can be overcome if the desire to have it is strong enough. Complete cost should be investigated in order that one may not be disappointed in that respect. The farmer should demand that he have the benefit of the lowest rate and cheap money. She emphasized cooperation in building lines to get the best rates. In speaking on the subject of Rural Credit, Mrs. Guy Roop, Virginia, said, "For safe rural living we must have adequate rural credit." The chief concern is for those who do not have resources to secure credit. People need to be informed as to what the federal government is doing in the matter of credit. This matter can be brought to the people </seg>
            <seg id="p487">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION through a community enterprise and effort, finance work centers, and thus bring to the people opportunities for better housing j and other advantages. .; Mrs. Ernest Overton of Nebraska , City, Nebraska, in dealing with the subject of Taxation, told of the contents of the paper on Taxation written by Mrs. S. P. Davis of Syracuse. This paper was an outgrowth of study in Mothers' Vacation Camp. In thinking of taxation we place too much emphasis on what we are paying and not enough upon what we are getting. Since the problems of taxation will be problems for our children to solve, they need to get the right perspective. Our children hear too much today of what the government owes us and not enough of what we owe the government. Mrs. Ellsworth Richardson of Iowa, in discussing Citizenship, told of the larger duties facing the farm wife of today. A few j years ago she had only to mold the emotions and philosophies of heir children, but now she must instill many essential factors into their lives. Not only must she teach them to perfect a philosophy of life, but also they must know how to advance cooperative efforts, to use science, to in - crease income, to improve the use of income, to improve the use of time, and to advance citizenship. I The subject of Cooperative Endeavors was discussed by Mrs. Wiley Williams of Georgia. She suggested that we had an ideal set-up for cooperation in the various channels of the Extension Service. Nowhere is cooperation so important as in the country from the members of the family groups down to the least important and most remote resi - dent in the community. Projects fail because we will not give in, often in some unimportant or minor matter. Mrs. Earl Porter, Kansas, presented the subject of Education. She emphasized the fact that the teacher in the country school should be one who has had experience, who appreciates and is interested in country life and its problems. She should not be, as is too often the case, inexperienced and merely getting experience so she can get into a town or city school system. Education is not only for the child, but for the father and mother as well so that they might be prepared to meet the issues of the day. Religion as presented by Mrs. Meade Ferguson, Virginia, revealed the fact that the rural church is in a sorry plight, whether it be in a richly populated area or in a more sparsely settled region. The auto - mobile, the radio, and a growing lack of interest in religion are the greatest factors in the problem. At this time Mrs. Edward Young, New York, under the title Hands Across the Sea, told of the international organization of rural women </seg>
            <seg id="p488">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE and brought cablegram greetings from Mrs. Watt, president of this organization. She also read a telegram from Mrs. Franklin D. Roose - velt, in which she sent greetings to the conference and regret that she was unable to attend. Mrs. Young said that rural women realize their influence in world relations. It is not enough to be passive, but we must work for world peace and economic security. This organiza - tion is non-sectarian, and non-political, but intensely religious. It is one of the most effective organization for promoting peace and good will. It is growing and extending in - all directions. It has for its ultimate object world pence. At. their last -meeting in London, the organization expressed a desire to come to America, so the Third Inter - national Council of Rural Women will be held in Washington in June, 1936. I chose to attend the group which was to discuss Citizenship. Very interesting ideas were introduced as to the part women should take in creating a higher ideal of citizenship. Intelligent voting was em - phasized. It was suggested that such subjects as health, recreation and citizenship might be studied in project clubs during the months when extension work is not being done. We were told of the Women's Joint Legislative Forum in New York which, meets every week while the legislature is in session, to study bills presented to the legislature. In conclusion, it was stated that poor officers are elected by good people who do not vote. Each one who made a summary for the group expressed the strong conviction that better conditions could be attained if they were wanted badly enough to make the effort to get them. It was indeed a rich experience to think with those from distant places who discussed problems which we are wont to believe belong to our own locality. While in no sense a religious meeting, it was deeply spiritual. One could not but be impressed with the fact that rural women everywhere are taking an intelligent interest in all that affects the welfare of their community, state and nation. Several musical selections preceded the summaries of discussion groups. Dr. T. B. Manny, U. S. Dept. of Agriculture, gave a summary of the conference under the title "We Look Forward". He said coopera - tion, religion and education form the common denominator of the whole thing. The rural family is undergoing a series of changes from a patri - archal concept in which the father was head, to a co-partnership family in which husband and wife have an equal responsibility in the interests of the family. The family is still the most important educational function to children and parents, but forces are at work at the present time which tend to disintegrate the home by diverse interests. Home </seg>

The farm family should demand equivalent opportunities in educa - tion, health, religion, etc. For many projects, it is found that the participation of local workers is more effective than professional leader - ship. He tried to impress this point: what we want very intently we go after. Is a more abundant life worth striving for, or will we expect some agency to provide it? The will to work together will accomplish the more abundant life. That evening we enjoyed a rural home fellowship dinner at Pomerene Hall. Two troubadours with guitars mingled among the guests, leading in the singing. Favors of glass, pottery and apples were provided for guests by near-by firms. The general session of the American Country Life Association was opened with an address by Dr. Carl C. Taylor, President of' the Asso - ciation, on the subject, "What Kind of Rural Life Can We Look Forward to in the United States?" In answering this question, he opened up the subject in a general way, while the speakers following developed various phases of the subject, more in detail. Warren S. Thompson, The Scripps Foundation, Miami University, Oxford, Ohio, presented the subject, "Population Movements Which Affect the Welfare of the Farm Family". The movement of population from the country to the city has been halted during the depression and there is an increasing back-to-the-farm movement. Farm population is being urbanized faster than the city population could be ruralized. Young people refuse long hours and other hardships. It is desirable to move city workers to the more open spaces, but these population shifts present difficult problems to rural America. The commercial value must dominate our rural civilization, or other ideals will be lost. Subsistence homesteads must have a spiritual subsistence as well as a physical subsistence. (Subsistence infers living on the rugged edge of existence.) The C.C.C. boys are fitting into the forestry service, soil erosion work, flood control, etc., and are being fitted for long-time jobs. Large tracts of land are fit only for wild life preserves. The suggestion was made that these should be abolished and a high charge made to those wishing to hunt and fish. Urban couples moving to rural communities are not interested in school, furnish migratory labor, and constitute major relief problems. Sharing oppor - tunities rather than sharing wealth was suggested as a remedy, but no one thing will solve the problem of resettlement. The problem of relief is serious; it has been done on a wholesale scale, while previously it was in a more personal way. We need to sort carefully the people who are physically and mentally Bick as a result of the depression. The American people strongly object to the </seg>

Inferior labor could not be used on the farm because the work is diversified and hence requires skill and brains. It was urged, however, that the farmer adjust his opera - tions so that he could employ his help the year around. Murray Lincoln, Secretary of the Ohio State Farm Bureau Federa - tion, gave a stirring address upon the subject of "Rural Economic Cooperation". "Why must we have hunger in the midst of plenty?" Some think we must go back to the horse and buggy days. We don't -want to go back to the hard days of the past, but we must have the income to keep the new. He urged upon his audience the reading of E. Stanley Jones' book "Christ's Alternative to Communism". Youth of the world are questioning Christianity because of conditions today. He said the A.A.A. is going out of existence because it is based upon political action. Farm organizations must quit talking in terms of their own interests. The remedy of the economic problem is so simple we cannot find it. The conditions have been that industry was taking the cream, labor was insecure, and the farmer was getting the tail end. Two other books he urged to be read are Judge Brandeis' book, "Other People's Money" and Mrs. Sydney Webb's, "The Discovery of the Consumer". In conclusion, he said that we can remake America and the world through the right kind of cooperation. We attended a luncheon on Saturday. Hennan G. James, Presi - dent-elect of the Ohio University at Athens, Ohio, addressed the group on the subject, "The Improvement of Rural Government". He con - tended that county and rural government have not shown the im - provement in the last fifteen years that municipal government has shown. County government is still the dark continent of the govern - ment. The national government has become a much more vital thing to the individual. The county is not a suitable unit of government. It is an historic accident. County consolidation is bound to go on. Adult education is an excellent way to instill the idea of consolidation of counties. The press is a big factor. Prejudice must be overcome before consolidation is possible. With the subject "Adult Education in Rural Life", the speaker, Mr. Ernest Burnham, Western State Teachers' College, Kalamazoo, Michi - gan, said that age was a minor factor to consider. Energy, force and sincerity of purpose opened all avenues to education. Mr. Carroll Streeter, The Farmers' Wife, St. Paul, Minnesota, gave an interesting account of "Experiments in the Reorganization of Rural Health Facilities". He started by saying that we are too complacent about rural health conditions. In our assemblies we pass resolutions that we should have better health conditions and let it end there until next year and repeat the same process. Many Foundations have been </seg>
            <seg id="p491">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION established to promote public health. Two-thirds of those who die in child birth could be saved, infant mortality could be lessened, and diseases such as diphtheria can be prevented. Full time health units for farmers should be maintained. Rural hospitalization is fifty per cent inadequate. The quality of a hospital is important and should be inspected by competent officials. No self-respecting hospital will resent inspection. Farmers are ready to pay for health service, and it is cheaper to prevent rather than to try to cure. Cooperation in the employment of doctors and nurses makes this service cheaper and available to all. C. J. Galpin, Honorary President of the American Country Life Association, addressed the conference on the subject, "My Philosophy of Rural Life". He stated that the farmer must be a philosopher, the farmer's wife must be a philosopher and the farm laborer must be a philosopher to make life in its larger sense. He then denned a philoso - pher as being a harmonizer of the things of life. It is a shock to one to realize that everything has defects. One source of discontent is that each must live his whole life with himself. One must not look into self too much. His interest must center in other things than self. Farmers soften the blows by losing themselves in the things of nature. It is an obligation the rural community owes to the world to send its sons and daughters to the cities to instill and uphold its fine strain, into the city life. He stressed the fact that service to the last man is service to all; the task is not complete until the last man has been reached. During the three days of the conference which we attended there was very little planned for entertainment. Music was furnished at different times by several chorus groups. A light opera, "Trial by Jury" was sung by a county group. The annual banquet of the Country- Life Association was held at the Deshler Hotel on Friday evening. Two fine addresses were given, also music was furnished by the Jackson County Ohio Women's Chorus which was very fine. The conference continued through the next day, Sunday, but we left Columbus that morning. On our return trip we visited the Brown County Forest Reserve in Indiana, at the Indiana State University campus at Bloomington, some of the historic places around Vincennes, Indiana, passed through St. Louis on the first day of the American Legion convention, the University of Missouri, and two other colleges (for women) at Columbia, Missouri; we went on to Kansas City and St. Joseph, crossed into Kansas, and drove through to southeastern Ne - braska to Mrs. Overton's home where we left her, then on to Miss Wolph's home. Miss Brown and I journeyed on to Lincoln. I took a bus at ten that night going to Omaha and arrived home next morn - ing about six. </seg>
            <seg id="p492">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE HOARD OF AGRICULTURE A fine trip was ended and I feel deeply grateful to those to whom I owe this courtesy extended to me. It has opened up for me a vast new experience, not the least of which is this opportunity to visit you in this meeting of Organized Agriculture in our own state. I trust that I have been able to bring you something of the inspiration of the conference in giving us greater confidence in ourselves and in the ability of the women of our nation in being able to solve the problems that confront us. I think each went home with a broader vision of her relationship with the world and a high resolve to do more effective service in her own home and community. The second speaker of the afternoon was Mrs. Elsie Mies of Illinois. She spoke on the importance of homemaking. IMPORTANCE OP THE HOMEMAKER MRS. ELSIE W. MIES We, as homemakers, are inclined not to put the proper value upon our job. For years the census report has listed us with "Occupation — none". We often hear a woman say, "What in the world did she go to school for? She's going to get married. She certainly knows enough to rock a cradle without going to college." Of course we have learned now to know enough not to rock a cradle. A friend of mine came to see me a year or so ago and during the conversation she said she felt so sorry for her uncle. He had sacri - ficed and planned to send his daughter to college and she was a brilliant girl. She made Phi Beta Kappa, stood high in all of her classes and what do you think she's going to do? Get married. Of course the woman expected me to share with her my sympathy for the father. When I replied that I felt there was no place where the brain of a Phi Beta Kappa could be used to better service than in a home, she changed the subject. As a class, we as homemakers have not respected our job enough. A girl who graduated from college married, was not able to go back for a good many years but finally her class was having a special re - union and her family sacrificed so that she could make the trip. She anticipated with a great deal of pleasure the meeting of her classmates. When they had gathered together, each was to tell what he had done and what he had accomplished since leaving school. One was a teacher, one was a secretary, one was a librarian, and one had taken up nursing. The girl who had married was panic stricken. What could she say? And yet her turn was coming and she must make a statement. With knees trembling, she arose and said she hadn't done </seg>
            <seg id="p493">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION anything. She didn't have any job. She was just the wife of a farmer and mother of seven children. I think we'll all agree that she had a job, not only a job that took time and energy, but a job that in importance and contribution to the world was as great and as important as anyone of her class who was there. We should feel big. We should feel that as a class we are an important group — not feel big individually, you and I, but know the importance of our group. Rather I think we should feel humble. Am I big enough for my job? It is pretty hard to get a true estimate alone and It is impossible to get recognition alone. We must see ourselves as a part of the group, as a link in the chain. This can be true only through organization and working together. Just housekeeping is an important job. It is vital to the health and welfare of our families. It requires brain, strength, and ability to plan and use short cuts. Yet the job of homemaking is housekeeping plus and plus and plus. To illustrate, just the job of washing dishes is necessary and must be done well for the good of the health of our families. A woman told me the other day that she had seen some - where that we spend one year in five doing dishes. If we can find a system whereby we can be as efficient and yet speed up dish washing so that perhaps we spend only nine months in five years, the other three months can be given to the bigger jobs of homemaking. It is perfectly possible to be thinking of other things while washing dishes. We may have our minds in the clouds, but I am afraid that they are usually in the dishpan. Dr. Overstreet has said there is no place where knowledge, infor - mation and intelligence can be used to better advantage than in the job of homemaking. But the girl who marries, regardless of how brilliant she is^ is very likely to fixate at the amount of brain power necessary for housekeeping. I believe that a definite plan to avoid this is almost jnecessary, and I know of no better assistant than an organization for homemakers. For instance, there is the job of feeding the family. What to have is a question three times a day and three hundred sixty-five days in the year. This is followed by the questions of how to cook the food and how to serve it. The preparation of food Is a profession at which men and women who are chefs and caterers spend their lives, and yet we must do that for our family. In clothing, what to wear, how to wear clothes, when to wear them, how to make them, or how to buy them constitute a profession to which one could devote his life. And yet as far as our family is concerned, we must furnish this knowledge. In furnishing the home, knowing what to buy, how to make it, </seg>
            <seg id="p494">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE what arrangement should be made, and whether it meets the needs of the family, is a profesalon. Many people devote their lives to becoming interior decorators. I have often wondered if someone with plenty of money needed many brains. If we had the money, we could have an interior decorator come into our homes, tell us what kind of cur - tains to have, what kind of rugs to buy, what furniture was best suited to our home, and how to arrange it. There was one woman I knew who had money enough to have her home furnished in this way. She was very conscientious in doing just as the interior decorator had told her. The Woman's club was meeting there one day. Many of the women had brought bouquets of flowers. It was a gala affair and they wanted the house decorated. There were more bouquets brought than places that the interior decorator had said would be a good place for a bouquet. One of the women who was helping said, "Why not put a bouquet over here?" The lady of the house said, "I don't know whether we ought to or not. The interior decorator never mentioned that a bouquet could go there." Since then, I have been more con - vinced that if you have plenty of money you don't need brains, but I believe if we do the best we can, perhaps we and our family will enjoy the way we work out those problems. For them is created an atmosphere of home, in which we work for personality and de - velopment of character. After the meal is all prepared and on the table, there are such questions as these: Are Johnny's hands clean? Is he eating what he should and eating it as he should? Is the conversation pleasant? Is it conducive to the flow of digestive juices? Are we all happy? Is our home such that we will look back upon it as a place of love and happy memories? We often hear home spoken of today as a place to park for the night and a fining station because our family is so seldom together. The meal should not be a place to remind them of all their faults and shortcomings. When planning clothing for our family, we must decide whether the clothes are becoming, appropriate and within our budget. When we are keeping Mary clothed while she goes to high school, we must see that her clothing is such that she feels and looks like the other girls. I believe that we are helping to furnish her with a poise, a willingness and ability to meet people, that will help her to take her place in the world and give the service of which she is capable and that we would like her to render. If we can do this without making her selfish, we have made a contribution to her character. There is nothing I can think of that quite expresses my opinion of the boy or girl who is ashamed of dad and mother when they are depriving themselves in order to give advantages to their children. But if that happens, who is to blame? </seg>
            <seg id="p495">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION Mary should feel proud of her clothes. But mother should be dressed in such a way that Mary can feel proud of her and her appear - ance when she meets the other girls and their mothers. No matter what we are ourselves, we want our children to be especially fine. We may lecture, we may scold, we may implore them to do things well and be of fine character, thereby feeling that we have done our duty and yet "what we are and what we do Is shouting so loud they don't hear what we say." In the responsibility to our family physicially, Johnny is a big job. By the time we have filled him up four or five times a day from his ears to his shoestrings, kept him covered, his knees patched, and kept him clean behind the ears, it is a big job. Feeding him is more than keeping him filled. We must see that his food is the proper kind for bone building, for development, and for health. Science is taking away the alibis of the mothers. The days are gone when it was legi - timate for our grandmothers to say that a boy was tall and thin, pigeon-breasted and bow-legged. Our grandmothers could say, "I know Johnny is different, but all of his father's people were that way." We couldn't rest on such an alibi if we were to have a child in that condition for somewhere along the line we are sure there has been malnutrition. That child may have had plenty to eat, even his food may have been what a child should have, yet for some reason, either for lack of rest or inability to assimilate, he has experienced malnutri - tion. After Johnny is taken care of physically, we must remember that there is also a moral Johnny and a spiritual Johnny. Our responsibility to these phases of his nature are just as great. So much of the psychological, emotional side of man is determined in the treatment of the small boy that I am wondering if, in years to come when Johnny has a tantrum and is hard to manage, we will also have the alibi that he is like some of his father's people removed, and science will tell us that in his training mentally and spiritually, somewhere there has been malnutrition. A woman's duty as a homemaker has enlarged. What shall I call home? At the present time I live in an apartment. Shall I call one - sixth of that apartment house home? When I lived on a farm, could I think that a fence around four hundred acres of land was my home? Surely with the number of friends that I have in Illinois, I must call Illinois home. And, after all, most of life is friendship. I imagine, if the farm income ever becomes large enough that I can take a trip to Europe I will want to come back, and on the way back when I am entering New York harbor and see there the Statute of Liberty, my throat will fill and I'll say, "It's mighty fine to be home." </seg>
            <seg id="p496">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Then, as citizens, we homemakers have a civic duty to community, state and nation. Our husbands ask us to come in and help them with government housekeeping, for they gave us the franchise. It is a responsibility in which I think we should become informed as much as possible, and willing to do our part. Everywhere is needed efficiency, knowledge, strength, and character to do these tasks which constitute the homemaker's job. More than any group, we are responsible for the environment which will make or mar humanity, physically, morally, or spiritually. I don't believe we can get along alone. We need professional knowledge, inspiration, understanding, professional morals, and the ability to keep out of ruts, which I think can be achieved only through organiza - tion and mingling with the group. A rut, they say, is a grave open at both ends, but we are just as much buried as though it were closed at both ends, and unless something makes us put forth a special effort, we are apt to get into that rut. Homemaking is a job because of its regular routine and multiple duties, with work never really done. It is easy for the homemaker to stay home when the rest of the family goes away, and become an automaton and a convenience. The child and the husband, busy with their outside interests, think of mother as always there, and before we know it we become sorry for ourselves. We feel we are abused. We have been entirely to blame. -And it is a condition which I think we ought to conscientiously and intentionally avoid. If one has any desire to land in an insane asylum, I know of no faster method of getting there than feeling sorry for oneself. I believe that here also working and mingling with the group helps us in an understanding of our problems, not as individuals, but seeing our responsibility and our importance as civic duties, yes, religious duties. We would avail ourselves of every help, every opportunity of authentic knowledge, every important method to make ourselves as efficient as possible, to make us able to do housekeeping well, to re - lease time for the bigger jobs^of homemaking. Through the group we can demand standards for ourselves and our daughters when they come into the job of homemaking. I like to think of extension and extension groups as professional organizations for homemakers where there is offered an opportunity to receive and give, thus increasing our ability to serve. After all, the biggest thing that Christ came into this world to teach was service. </seg>

It has been customary for the President to give an address at the first meeting called but I am saving my speech to present tomorrow morning to the fruit growers. This is the sixty-seventh annual meeting of this Society and it is interesting to note how the type of meetings has changed during those years. The first topic on this morning's program is an illustrated lecture on "Bulbs" by Professor Wiggans. Professor Wiggans. </seg>
            <seg id="p500">UEPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE GARDENING WITH BULBS C. C. WIGGANS The use of bulbous plants for ornamental purposes dates back to antiquity and many references particularly to the lily are found in early literature. In the modern garden dependence upon bulbs for striking displays at certain seasons is almost universal, and the seeds - man or nurseryman has made available a great variety of sorts for such purposes. Recent years has seen a tremendous increase in the use of bulbous species. In this discussion no effort is made to cover completely the bulb field but merely to call attention to a few of the many kinds which may be used. Why grow bulbs? Bulbs are valuable from two standpoints — as garden material and as cut flowers. As garden subjects the so-called "Dutch" bulbs, tulip, hyacinth, narcissus and other spring flowering species are most useful while for cutting purposes, the gladiolus stands supreme. This does not mean, however, that those of one class have no value for the other purpose since both types are used for both cutting and garden effects. Regardless of the particular purpose to be served bulbs do have specific advantages over other plant types. 1st — quickness of results. No other species can be planted and then so quickly reach its height of success. Crocus and daffodils planted in the fall and given per - haps a light winter mulch show themselves in full flower soon after the snow leaves. Tulpis and hyacinths follow a- little later and then come the lilies. Gladiolus in from sixty to ninety days is at its best. No other species, be they annual or perennial, tender or hardy, quite equal the record of the bulbous group. As a second advantage may be mentioned the surety of success. A tulip or hyacinth bulb planted at the proper time will almost in - variably give a bloom, unfavorable weather conditions being always excepted. Each bulb is a complete plant within itself. If given water, it can develop entirely without outside assistance so far as food supply is concerned. Thus they can be grown in sand or moss and bloom satisfactorily, although of course a bulb so treated has little or no value for future years since there is no chance for it to store up energy for the next year's crop. As a third consideration, one may have bulbs in bloom from frost to frost. From the earliest crocus to the gladiolus which is caught by frost is a span of several months and every day of that period can be filled with a display from some part of the bulb garden. This par - ade includes all sorts of subjects from the tiny Scilla to the stately lily which may be eight feet tall and presents a regular rainbow so far as color choice is concerned. In no other class of plants do we find </seg>
            <seg id="p501">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY such a variety of bloom or such a steady supply of blossoms. A little planning will supply the living room with bulbous blooms throughout the winter months also. Finally bulbs are valuable because they cost comparatively little. The price of a rose bush or good shrub will buy a dozen and further - more the woody things are more expensive in time and labor when planting time arrives. Whore should bulbs be used? Bulbs can be had which will fit almost any degree of shade, of moisture and of soil type or fertility. They can be used in the smallest garden or on the large estate, for a spot of color in the shrubbery border or in the formal beds in the bulb garden. Another very desirable use is for naturalizing purposes, —that is the planting of large quantities in locations where it would; seem that they might naturally be found, such as along a stream or in a bit of woods. Such usage is somewhat limited on the average city - lot because of lack of space but even here crocus, etc. may be planted indiscriminately in the lawn near old trees or in other suitable loca - tions. Irregular planting of groups gives a better effect than if they are crowded together too solidly or planting systematic spacing. How to Plant Bulbs. Bulbs as well as all other living plants have their preferences as to soil conditions and exposure. In general they demand good drainage and a fair degree of soil fertility. Few species, even of the water loving sorts will survive if water stands about the roots very long. Slight elevation of the bed will insure at least surface drainage but in extreme cases it may be necessary to introduce special provisions for taking away any excess water. Good soil preparation, of course, pays dividends in increased growth. Average good garden soil probably needs no addition of fertilizers. If preliminary preparations have been properly made the plant - ing itself is fairly simple. In planting two or three things should be kept in mind. First of all they should be set at the proper depth and secondly there should be close contact between the base of the bulb and the moist soil since only through this means is the bulb able to absorb water. A bulb placed so that there is an air space below it is very poorly planted. Depth of the planting depends upon the species and habit of growth and also to some degree upon soil conditions. Generally rather spec - ific planting directions are available in advertising material. About three times the greatest diameter is the recommended depth. This means 4-6 inches for tulips, 6 to 8 for narcissus and even 10-12 for certain lilies. In heavy soil planting depth is less than in the lighter types of soil. Immediate soaking will insure good soil contact and prompt growth. </seg>
            <seg id="p502">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The time to plant again depends upon the bulb type. In the case of fall set bulbs generally the early plantings arb most satisfactory since they permit more time for fall root growth. With spring set sorts succession plantings will give a longer bloom period but the last plant - ing must be set early enough to permit proper bulb maturity before frost if the bulbs are to be used again next year. How to care for bulbs. Ordinarily the hardy bulbs require little attention aside from weed control unless it is desired to change their location. Some bulbs such as narcissus seldom need moving but cer - tain tulip types soon run out — that is, develop many bulbs too small for bloom. On the other hand, tender types such as the gladiolus must be dug annually and stored until the next year. Whenever it becomes necessary or desirable to lift bulbs, nothing should be done until the leaves begin to show signs of maturity or as is sometimes the case with gladiolus, — the frost danger is present. Soil may be left clinging to the bulbs and the whole mass stored away in a dry place. The natural habitat of the bulb is in the soil and the more nearly natural conditions can be simulated the better will the bulb keep. Then before planting, the old stems and leaves may be broken away, together with the smaller bulbs. These smaller bulbs, after one or more seasons in the garden may reach blooming size and become useful again. What shall be planted? The bulbs selected for planting will vary with the desires of the individual. The following is by no means a complete list but is given only as suggestive of some of the sorts which may be used. No effort has been made to mention varieties. Rather the list is confined to types with some comments as to their respective merits. Tulips — one of the most popular. Single Early — one of the earliest to flower — often used in bed - ding work — stems rather short — good for forcing indoors. Double Early. A double flowered type — blooms resemble small peonies — quite short stems — flowers very lasting — also good for forcing. Cottage — follow the single earlies in season of bloom — stems somewhat longer — wide range of color — splits up rather readily necessitating frequent renewal. Darwins — The popular long stemmed long keeping sort — flow - ers are egg or cup-shaped — generally self colored rather than striped. Breeders — similar to Darwins except that colors are mostly bronzy or brown. Old Dutch &amp; Rembrandts — similar to Breeders &amp; Darwins ex - cept that the color has been "broken," "striping" and "feath- </seg>
            <seg id="p503">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY erlng" quite frequent. Parrot — Varieties generally of the Darwin type which develop on weak stems and have much laclnated petals. Very good for cutting since they do not have the stiffness so often associated with Darwins. Lily-flowered — A new type produced by hybridization. The flowers are lily shaped with pointed petals. Mendel or Hybrids — another new type developed through hybridization work. Tulip species — various types useful for rock gardening and for other special purposes. Daffodils or narcissus. One of the finest bulbs to be found for naturalizing. Trumpet Daffodils — trumpet as long or longer than the petals. Yellow or white or a combination of these colors. Large-cupped Daffodils (Incomparable). The cup is shorter than the petals but at least one-third as long. Petals may be white or yellow and some red may appear on the cup. Short-cupped Daffodils (Barri) Cup less than one-third the length of the petals. The petals are yellow or white but the cup may be yellow or touched with red. Large, short cupped Daffodils (Leedsi) Petals are white with a white, cream or primrose cup. Triandrus and Triandrus hybrids — cyclamen flowered type petals reflexed and flowers drooping. Cyclamineus and cyclamineus hybrids. Petals reflexed and trumpets yellow and tubular; very early. Jonquills — clustered, fragrant, bright yellow flowers. Tazetta and Tazetta hybrids — three or more flowers to each stem. Poeticus — snowwhite petals, cup or eye shallow, generally yel - low or yellow edged with crimson. Double varieties — varieties of various above types in which the petals have been increased in number. Narcissus species — includes a number of minor species of rela - tively little value. Hyacinths — A species very useful for bedding because of its short stocky uniform and formal type of flower stem. Avail - able in both double and single forms. Very useful in the border if used in amall groups. Exhibition hyacinths — the largest size bulbs (2% inches or more in diameter). Useful for forcing. \ Bedding hyacinths — bulbs 2 V4 inches in diameter. - Minatures or Dutch Roman hyacinths — just under 2 inches in diameter. Crocus — One of the earliest of the spring flowers — available in a considerable range of colors. </seg>

Leaves and seed pods generally do not develop until the following spring. Minor spring flowering bulbs. These include Chionodoxa (Glory of the snow), Muscari (grape hyacinths), Scillas (wood hyacinths) Galanthus (snow drops) etc. They are quite valuable for their very early bloom and are often used for naturalizing. This is particularly true of the Scilla. Other hardy things such as Ornithogul. Lilies — In the lily group are found some of the most widely grown of all the bulbous species. The old fashioned Tiger lily was a favorite in our grandmothers' gardens and although it has been somewhat replaced by newer sorts it still is frequently seen. Lilies vary greatly in their requirements but all demand special attention with respect to drainage. Frequently when lilies are being planted a quantity of sand is used in the bottom of the hole. The bulbs are sometimes laid on the side but such a practice should be unnecessary. Depth of planting depends upon the rooting habit. For those species that root mainly from the base of the bulb shallow planting is used but deep setting is essential in those cases where roots arise mainly from the stem. No attempt will be made to discuss the various sorts. Much in - formation concerning them is available from various sources, how - ever. Among the sorts which thrive fairly well under our condi - tions are elegans, unbellatum, coral, Madonna, regal, tiger, superbum, etc. This list may be extended considerably by any enthusiast who is willing to give time and attention to the lily group. Gladiolus. The gladiolus is justly one of the finest of cut flowers for summer use. The tall beautiful colored spikes are available soon after summer begins while the early frost will catch the late ones. Gladiolus varieties have improved greatly in recent years. The old fashioned sort has been improved by hybridization and now there are available sorts with ruffled petals, with serrated petals and many salmon, orange and yellow primulinus hybrids. Also sorts which will throw more than one spike — the cut-and-come-again type, are more or less common. New sorts are available from the breeders every year. Varieties are legion and one or more is available to suit any color preference. Gladiolus bulbs are graded according to diameter; No." l's are 1% inches or more; No. 2's 1%-1%; No. 3's 1-1%, etc. Bulb value is not </seg>

As the bulbs grow older they become larger but also tend to flatten out or even became concave on top. Such bulbs are not so desirable as a much smaller, "high crown - ed" bulb of considerably less age. These young vigorous bulbs will start more quickly and produce a more desirable growth than will the older larger ones. Plantings should be made at intervals since varieties can thus be kept in bloom over a much longer period. Four plantings made in April, May, June and July with some early, midseason, and late vari - eties included at each period will give almost four months of con - tinuous bloom. A deep rich soil will produce the finest spikes but gladiolus bulbs will at least bloom under quite adverse conditions it a strong bulb is planted. Tcrnlcr or half hardy sunnm-i- flowering sperirs. There is a long list of desirable sorts which may be grown if given considerable care. Some of these are really not true bulbs but in general are handled in a fashion very comparable to bulb culture. Generally these are much taller and more vigorous than the spring flowering sorts. Among these may be mentioned the dahlia, tuberous rooted begonias, tuberose, caladium, Amorphophallus, etc. These each require their own special care and hence no generalizations are given. They as well as all other bulbs mentioned do respond, however, and give good returns if properly treated. Have you time to tell what is the difference between the Madonna and the Regal lily? MR. WIGGANS: The Madonna lily must be planted and make considerable growth in the fall. It forms a cluster of leaves at the base and, in the spring, the stem comes from this base. The Regal lily is planted in the fall also but does not make any growth above the ground. It comes up in the spring and has grass-like leaves. The blossoms of both are somewhat alike except that the Madonna is white while the Regal lily is red or pink on the outside. Does the Madonna bloom first? MR. WIGGANS: Yes. Madonna blooms in June, the Regal not until later. MR. KUIIIEL: Are there any more questions you would like to ask Professor Wiggans? I am sure everyone here has enjoyed your talk and the slides very much, Professor "Wiggans. The next dis - cussion sounds very interesting. It will be a talk on "Highway Beau - tiflcation" by W. L. Younkin of the State Highway Department. Mr. Younkin. </seg>
            <seg id="p506">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ROADSIDE BEATJTIFICATION MR. YOUNKIN I am here to talk to you on Roadside Beautiflcation. The word Beautiflcation has been generally sidestepped by those connected with this kind of work in favor of the word Improvement — Roadside Im - provement. The engineers have disliked Beautiflcation because of its effeminate sound and in our highway department, the few of us assigned to roadside improvement have been dubbed the "Cosemetology Division". I like the word Beautiflcation. The word Improvement has a broad meaning, can signify a betterment that may not be of beautifying char - acter and fails to catch the ear in the sense that is intended. Beautiflca - tion has a greater publicity value, is indicative of higher aim and car - ries an esthetic meaning suggestive of pleasing reaction to the eye. And when you come down to it, is not the object to provide, through the eye of the traveler, the greatest benefits possible from what might other - wise be waste space between the traveled way and the property line. You are hearing more and more each year of Roadside Beautifica - tion. Without thought on the matter, to most of us this means but one thing, the addition of decorative treatment to the fringes of right of way bordering the roadbed. But it has far greater significance. It stands for improvement along practical lines rather than esthetic. It seeks to curb and eliminate, on the grounds that such elements im - peril driving through distraction, the hideous eyesores that rush in upon our highways immediately following the pulling of stakes by the contractor. It includes cleaning up and conserving the natural beauty of the countryside for the benefit of the pleasure driving public. It endeavors to eliminate the traffic hazard of fatigue by giving the tired driver diversion through enhancement of adjacent surroundings, and to exemplify the greatest points of interest. Only thirty years ago our roads were all country roads. Twenty years before that they were the same roads or trails in the same loca - tion. The man living along these spent his life in making things grow, his wheat, his corn, his cotton or whatever it might be. Unconscious artistry crept into his life. He bordered his fields and roads with trees. Over the span of years his sprouts and seedlings grew into mature trees under which he took time out to escape the summer sun. His sphere of travel was limited to infrequent trips to the nearest town for his mail, to swap his produce for supplies or to take his best girl for a Sun - day afternoon drive. His travel threaded its way through country - side having a charm now reminiscent only of earlier days. All that is changed now — the automobile did it. i </seg>
            <seg id="p507">NEHRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY With the coming of the automobile our spheres of travel spread and we became bolder in speed. Our jaunts acquainted us with the second and third towns beyond. What was the other fellow's town now became ours, his countryside became ours, he became our neigh - bor. We took to journeying so far from home that we began to com - plain because of the time it took even with the automobile and as there was only one way to meet our demands we surfaced our roadbeds. Even this outlived its day and we demanded that old paths be aban - donned and our routes be made as straight and direct as speed and safety would permit. Roads became highways and highways abandoned all considerations but that of speed. Setting and environment were ignored, resulting in location often being through bare open and flat country entirely devoid of scenic charm of earlier days. Accompanying such drastic changes came the influx of people seek - ing to eke out an existance upon the edges of our improvements. The gasoline stations, the hot dog stands, the tourist camps and worst of all the hordes of out-door advertisers. Almost over night these alighted to infest our brand new arteries of gleaming concrete and carefully leveled parkways with endless make-shift delapidated structures pain - ful to the eye. Signs everywhere, signs on the structures themselves, signs so thick as to screen one another. These conditions grow worse as we approach cities and towns. A majority of approaches wind their way through automobile junk heaps, slum sections and wholesale quarters. Our business districts are shadeless, dusty and hideously built. They are filled with bad - looking, off color, carelessly designed buildings with little or no relief of trees or planting. It is the same everywhere you go, they are all alike in their dreariness. Contrast here the beauty of the residence district of any town with the hodge-podge of its business district. But the American City is another chapter and we are getting off the highway. Nevertheless, you have to go through them if you travel. The mutilators of our highways claim immunity on the grounds of private property. It is the same old story. We experienced the same gag from people mutilating our State House and the planting on its grounds. "Who paid for it?" is the excuse. Which leaves us rather aghast. . Who built the highways? Did we not, everyone of us, contribute to their being through the means of some form or other of taxation? Are we to have no voice or consideration in their control? And are we going to continue to keep up and maintain these highways for the benefit of various business operating along them, without exercising . the privilege of restriction. </seg>
            <seg id="p508">REPOV.T OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The United States Bureau of Public Roads advises that the major portion of highway traffic is now recreational. This should be enough of a warning to the despoiler. Prom the pleasure seeker he derives his livelihood. The pleasure class, being in majority, controls public opinion, and public opinion has become strong enough in a number of the states to enact statutes governing roadside business. It is not abolition of the nuisances that the public demands, it is that they clean up, that they meet their obligations in the beautiflcation movement. Service stations, refreshment stands, tourist camps, can just as well be properly designed to play a part in roadside scheme and at practically no additional cost. No one objects to their presence if they are an integral part of the landscape but he does object if they create visual discomfort. One sees many a roadside structure covered with signs; they may be seen about Lincoln. Why would not one sign suffice, and some trees and a bit of lawn. Highway advertising is ridiculous and wasteful. The highways were made for traffic and not advertising. One is almost given to interpretation of the perpetrator's aim in corruption of a well known verse, "He who rides must read". If you travel at a speed of forty miles an hour you have no time to read and if you travel at a moderate pace you are enraged at the marring or obliteration of the landscape. If you do read, the sign becomes a distracting hazard. Several years ago, the president of one of the biggest out-door ad - vertising companies was asked if he could give any figures on returns to his clients from bill-boards under his control. He could not — and I do not suppose there are any means by which this could be estimated. I am sure I have never purchased any commodity because I saw it advertised upon the highway and I doubt whether you ever have. If the business men of • our towns would divert what money they spend on road advertising into channels that would eliminate some of the absurd and disorderly liabilities of their community, I am cer - tain the returns would be more positive and they would show them - selves more progressive merchants and citizens. As I mentioned before the bulk of our traffic is recreational. It is estimated that something over $4,000,000,000 is spent annually by tourists in the United States. During the summer months this runs as high as $200,000 a day in some of the tourist states. South Dakota claims to have derived a $2,000,000 seasonal income from tourists visiting the Black Hills because of the publicity given Gutzon Borglum's gigantic carving on Mount Rushmore. North Carolina claims its tour - ist business its fourth largest asset. There is hardly a state in the Union today that is not a tourist state. Could anything be better proof </seg>
            <seg id="p509">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY of the financial asset we have in our highways? The early roadside improvements were civic undertakings sponsored by real estate boards, chambers of commerce, motor clubs, American Legion posts or garden clubs. These organizations were awake to the business possibilities of having clean, beautiful approaches to their communities. For a number of years these organizations have been working for state legislation governing roadside control and planting. State Highway departments cooperated as much as they were able but laws of most states did not permit expenditure of highway funds for the purpose of roadside beautiflcation. Such is the present situation in Nebraska. We are now sorely in need of state aid for the purpose of acquiring adequate right of way and maintaining of the improvements so generously contributed to by the Federal Government. As early as 1928 a number of the states had well organized activities relating to roadside work. Massachusetts and Pennsylvania at that time had state aid for all branches of beautification. Connecticut had annual appropriations to the tune of $250,000. California had planted 700 miles of trees. Delaware, Missouri, Iowa, Kentucky, Nevada and Michigan all had plans for the immediate future. I mention all this to show the early interest of eight years ago. In Nebraska I might mention the early activities of the Lincoln Garden Club and American Legion, the Omaha Garden Club, American Legion of Auburn, Women's Club of Superior, American Legion of Seward and Civic Clubs of Holdrege, Aurora and Hastings. There were probably many more with which we had no contact. Incidentally, I want to call attention to the wonderful work of the City of Fremont in converting during the past year what was a city dump at the south entrance to town into what promises to be a beauty spot in years to come. In the year 1933, the United States Bureau of Public Roads set up, in its rules and regulations governing expenditures, the stipulation that at least one-half of one per cent of all Federal state allowances be spent upon the improvement of our roadsides. Coming as a part of the National Relief program it had the purpose of aiding all those con - nected in any way with Landscape work. It offered to the nursery - men and horticulturists not only relief from the effects of the depres - sion but also an opportunity to participate in a nationwide movement toward bettering the environment of our highways. No doubt Thomas H. MacDonald, Chief of the Bureau of Public Roads, had a great deal to do with the Government sponsoring this movement. He had always been a champion of roadside beautifica- </seg>
            <seg id="p510">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE tion probably prompted by the realization that conditions adjacent to our highways had created a major problem. The first appropriation to Nebraska amounted to approximately $39,000. This was repeated in 1934 and increased in 1935 to $50,000. In addition to the regular 1935 appropriation, there is also available $73,000 under the Works Progress Administration. I quote here from the rules accompanying the initial appropriation: "It will be required that each state highway department include in its program of construction on the Federal-aid highway system a definite number of projects that will provide for the appropriate land - scaping of parkways or roadsides. Projects of this character should preferably be selected adjacent to the corporate limits of the larger cities in the State, particularly where sufficient right of way is available to undertake work of this character. This work shall embrace the selective cutting or pruning of existing growth, the removal of stumps, dead material, etc., the obliteration of borrow pits, traces of old roads and other construction scars, the flattening of slopes, the rounding of slope sections, the seeding or sodding of shoulders and slopes and the planting of a sufficient amount of suitable material to accomplish a reasonably comprehensive improvement. The planting of trees at regular intervals without regard to their environment or the com - position will not be considered as satisfactory roadside improvement work." Under the appropriation assigned to the State of Nebraska the De - partment of Roads and Irrigation began developing its program of Roadside Improvement. It found that because of the vast extent of Nebraska, approximately five hundred miles in length and two hun - dred fifty miles in width, a wide variety of clime and country was to be encountered. This meant a more careful selection of plant life for different localities and at the same time permitted the use of a greater variety than could be employed in states of lesser size. Considerable study was made on the choice of location of highways suitable for improvement bearing in mind that such should be dis - tributed throughout the state in order to spread interest and equalized the benefits. Improvements on the heaviest travelled roads afforded the greatest opportunity of display, both to residents and out-of-state visitors. Sometimes these were permanent locations of oil or concrete roadbeds and were safe considerations while others which had prospect of change of location in the near future had to be put aside for future consideration. The densely populated districts were served with roads demanding attention in appearance and also were carrying heavy loads of unemployed needing work. Existing physical conditions played an important part in final </seg>
            <seg id="p511">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY choice. Adequate right of way was most important. A major portion of Nebraska highways are located on a strip of land but sixty-six feet in width with but seventeen feet on either side for planting. Unless these are reasonably free from open ditches, uneven terrain and pole lines, consideration is useless. The more recently developed highways, however, have right-of-way of eighty, one hundred and one hundred twenty feet, widths affording opportunities for comprehensive and in - telligent design. Territory having a certain amount of wooded area was naturally attractive and required little work beyond that of clean - ing up and smoothing of scars. Two distinct treatments of design presented themselves, that of avenue approaches to municipalities or the intensifying of open country planting. The avenue approaches receive formal or semi-formal treatment consisting of studied arrangement of the small plant life backed up with rows of trees. The countryside receives treatment of group plant - ing in the effort to create the impression that such trees and shrubs as exist came by their location by nature. This last treatment is most intriguing as it is the one employed in framing what might otherwise be an overlooked gem of landscape. Under the 1934 appropriation the following projects were com - pleted: Homer-Dakota City — 7 miles. Blair-Herman — 9 miles. Omaha-Waterloo — 20 miles. Union South — 3 miles. Lincoln West — 1 mile. McCook East — 4 miles. Bayard North — 4 miles. Scottsbluft-Mitchell — 8 miles. Seward East — 4 miles. The total planting of the above projects Included four thousand trees and thirty thousand shubs. Lincoln West and a portion of the Omaha-Waterloo projects embraced avenue approach treatment, the remainder was open country grouping. Evergreens together with deciduous trees and shubs were planted in the Elkhorn River Valley-Omaha Waterloo project; Seward East; Homer-Dakota City and McCook East. All other projects had only deciduous material. A poll of survival at the end of the season showed a loss of from 6 to 33% among individual projects. I need hardly tell you that those suffering the least contained a per centage of evergreens. Smallest </seg>
            <seg id="p512">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE loss occurred at Homer-Dakota City, the greatest at Bayard or Scotts - bluff. The project at McCook received no attention at all through the summer due to the maintenance crew being busy with the flood situa - tion, yet only a 17% loss occurred. In all cases where loss was heavy a great deal of it was due to tree borers. The trees suffering greatest from the summer heat and drouth were the oaks in the Missouri River section of the state, these apparently suffering from extreme heat rather than lack of moisture. We have but unofficial reports from adjoining states of their survival upon similar projects, which if true, causes us to believe that Nebraska came through far in the lead. During November last the following projects were planted in the 1935 program: Omaha-Waterloo — 4 miles. Falls City North — 7 miles. Holdrege East — 7 miles. Aurora East — 4 miles. Howard Boulevard-Columbus — 3 miles. The remainder of the 1935 and 1936 appropriations will be spent during this year. The XJ. S. Bureau rules permit the inclusion of work upon recrea - tional parks adjoining the highway. To take advantage of this the City of Crawford subsribed a ten acre tract at the opening of Bryan Canyon and the Bushnell Irrigation District, a park site adjoining its reservoir. Recreational Parks lying upon highways and belonging to the Fish, Game and Reforestration Commission are now receiving con - sideration. A portion of such improvements will be contracted for in the coming spring. An interesting treatment that promises to materialize is a series of State Line Gateways embracing a four or five hundred foot parked strip upon the entry of main highways into the State of Nebraska. The grounds are laid out much in the manner of a lodge gateway to an estate, containing portal, resting grounds for the tourist and proper consideration for structure to house state activities when necessary, such as the gasoline tax collectors and state police. Too much should not be expected immediately of the work now being done. Small size stock is being put out to insure a maximum of survival and it may be eight or ten years before the public really has an opportunity to be impressed with results. Nor is it intended that such plant life shall receive garden care after the first several years, but shall be able to carry its own battle after it becomes well established. Nebraska probably does not appreciate its possibilities with regard to encouraging tourist travel within its confines. While it lacks the </seg>
            <seg id="p513">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY attraction to encourage collective gathering such as occurs during the summer months in our sister states of Colorado, Wyoming and South Dakota, it should not overlook the fact that it is an avenue of approach to these states for the Easterner, an avenue through which he must spend at least one day of his travel. Prom the bluffs of the Missouri; through cultivated hills hemmed in with wooded bottom-lands, along the banks of the Republican, Platte and Niobrara Rivers, across the open flat of the wheat lands and the austerity of the sandhills to the pine clad buttes, Nebraska has ample background for beautiful, zoned and planted highways. And it should not overlook the fact that such would be a "stimulus for the purchase of automobiles. If you drive you buy gasoline, and if you use gasoline you go to hotels and on the way you buy soft drinks, cigarettes and a thousand other things." The returns would compensate for the effort in improving our roadsides. Discussion East of Seward, where they are putting trees in groups by the road - side, they are putting them on the shoulder at the edge of the pave - ment. If the road has to be built up again, would those have to be taken out? MR. YOUNKIN: Yes, they would have to be taken out. We con - sider the concrete roadbed as being permanent and, in doing roadside planting, we take this into consideration. At Seward, we would have to acquire additional right-of-way. Trees are planted closer at Seward than elsewhere, are they not? MR. YOUNKIN: I believe so. The later plantings allowed more space. Up our way, one of the worst troubles is weeds along the right-of - way. Why wouldn't it be possible for the road grader, instead of mak - ing a vertical bank against the farmers' land, to make a sloping bank so farmers could cut the weeds with a mowing machine between the fence and road. This would be a big help to the farmer in improving the roadway. Lots of farmers help by planting flowers and trees around their own places as well as along the roadway. The farmers certainly can do things to improve their own places. Let's have a little cooperation so we can keep the weeds down. MR. YOUKIN: I think you will find most of the highways that have that particular condition existing to be old highways. The Federal government does not permit us to install that kind of ditch any more. We are compelled to round the bank even if it is necessary to buy </seg>
            <seg id="p514">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE additional land. Is that on the main highway or on the side roads? State or county roads? MR. YOUNKIN: State highways. Does any state have an appropriation for cutting weeds and taking care of roadsides? MR. YOUNKIN: I do not know. In this state, our maintenance crew does a certain amount of it. In a number of cases, the farmers adjacent do the cutting and they are willing to do it for the cuttings they can get from the right-of-way. Q. It looks to me that if the Highway Department did the cutting, they would have better equipment to work with and could keep all the highways in better condition just as the railroads do. A. Of course, maintenance expense In this state is terrific. We have such a large mileage of highways where there are hardly any people living and the appropriation does not allow keeping them up properly. However, these highway beautification projects will be kept in better shape. Q. In planting evergreens, did they use anything except Juniper? A. Yes. In the Waterloo valley project, Austrian pines were planted exclusively with a loss of only 1% or 2%. Juniper was used on other highways. Q. Whom would you consult in regard to highway maintenance? For instance, we are on Washington Highway No. 73, Douglas county. That highway used to-be maintained by the county but now it is done by the state and we have a seventeen foot strip between the paving and the fence. This strip is nice turf. Two years ago we planted a windbreak on this strip with trees we got through the Extension Serv - ice but CWA workers burned the strip, trees and all, and last winter PWA workers dug a ditch to throw dirt out along the highway and dug up the hollyhocks planted by the World-Herald. A. The responsibility is that of the state. I would like to talk to you more about that later. STATEMENT: I think we should also complain about some of the farmers who sometimes burn the roadside or turn the cattle in and destroy plantings. A. Quite often we have farmers who will cut trees of a roadside planting adajacent to their land for fear the trees will grow up and shade their land.

KIMMEL: I am sure, Mr. Younkin, that you have the thanks of everyone here for your fine paper. We enjoyed it very much. The next discussion on the program is "Nebraska Windbreaks" by Mr. E. G. Maxwell, State Extension Forester. Mr. Maxwell. NEBRASKA WINDBREAKS EARL G. MAXWELL, State Extension Forester A discussion of Nebraska Windbreaks at this time is a timely one, it seems to me, in view of the fact that so many trees have recently been killed by drouth, also because of the great numbers that have been cut for fuel during the depression and on account of the marked increase of interest generally in farm forestry. Tree planting activities in Nebraska in years past gained for the state a nation wide reputation in this regard. Kind of trees to plant, spacing and cultural practices were topics frequently discussed. I was interested recently in looking over some of the early annual reports of the State Horticultural Society and especially in learning of the great amount of attention that was given at the meetings to the matter of forest tree planting in the early years. The annual report of 1902 shows that eight different talks were given on different phases of forest tree planting. That year Dr. Bessey, J. Sterling Morton and other prominent men addressed the meeting on subjects relating to forestry. Frequent references were made to drouth and its effect on tree growth. That was thirty-four years ago and during the inter - vening years millions of trees have been planted over the state, many of them in windbreaks about farm buildings and feed lots to afford protection against winter winds. Nebraska has had for several years a tree planting program and not a small part of this is the planting of windbreaks, shelterbelts and woodlots by farmers in cooperation with the Agricultural Extension Service. In the past ten years 7,327,000 broadleaf forest tree seedlings and evergreen transplants have been distributed for this purpose through provision of the Clarke-McNary Act. During this time the United States Forest Service and the Nebraska Nurserymen's Associa - tion have cooperated with the Extension Service in furthering the tree planting program. This project permits trees to be secured at low enough cost so that anyone can afford to plant. Through this cooperative agreement trees are distributed at cost of packing and shipping. They are not available for general landscaping purposes or to be grown for re-sale. Since 1926, the first year of the Clarke-Mc- </seg>
            <seg id="p516">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Nary distribution in Nebraska, there has been a gradual increase in demand for these trees and for each of the last two years over a million trees have been sent out, most of which have been used for planting of farmstead windbreaks. A good many of the windbreaks to be found growing throughout the state today have been started with these Clarke- McNary trees. When we think of a million trees it seems like a large number but it is only a small fraction of the number of trees planted in Nebraska during the years 1885 to 1890, years in which the largest numbers were planted. According to early reports there were single 'seasons when as many as one hundred million trees were planted. While trees sent out by the Extension Service are being planted mainly for wind protection around farm buildings, field shelters con - sisting of one or more rows of trees on the boundary or across the farm to reduce wind velocity and thus conserve moisture and prevent soil blowing and also to act as a barrier against destructive hot winds of summer are being advocated by many farmers who have had an op - portunity to observe the benefits of such plantings. The damage caused by hot winds and dust storms during the last few years and also pub - licity given to the Plains Shelterbelt Project have had their effect in stimulating interest in plantings of this kind. The surface of the soil is dried out quickly by evaporation. Farmers usually plow and cultivate with the object of conserving as much of the moisture which falls during the year as possible. Anything which helps to conserve the moisture is of direct benefit to the farmer. The windbreak or shelter belt has this effect in a marked degree. The drying power of the wind is reduced by the windbreak very nearly in the same proportion as its velocity is checked. Cut down wind velocity and you reduce evaporation. Tests carried on by the U. S. Forest Serv - ice show that evaporation is reduced as much as 65 per cent in the im - mediate lee of the most effective windbreak. Farther from the trees the reduction is less. Farmers often question the benefits of trees planted next to culti - vated fields and argue that they result in lower yields. This might be true in the case of a single row of big cottonwoods running north and south and through which the wind can pass freely. However, a plant - ing made of one row of low growing trees like Russian Olive or Russian Mulberry and one or more rows of some taller growing species of broad - leaf trees or even a single row of Austrian or Western Yellow Pine, if planted east and west, will prove very beneficial. A long time resident of Nebraska has the following to say relative to the benefits derived from shelter belt plantings: "Our old farm that was homesteaded seventy-five years ago had a windbreak of trees planted clear around 160 acres of it and an Osage </seg>
            <seg id="p517">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY hedge, untrimmed, across it north and south and east and west cutting it up into forty-acre tracts. The first real outstanding service this windbreak did in crop protection, was on July 25, 1894, when we had a hot wind which swept all over this country and which almost ruined the corn crop. Our corn in these protected fields, yielded us an aver - age of 28 bushels per acre. The south half of each field furnished a better yield than the north half. Outside of this windbreak the corn yielded all the way from five to fifteen bushels. This windbreak caused an increase in yield a good many times later on." "There is a farm near Plainview, Nebraska which has a tree claim strip of timber along the south side of 160 acres which in 1918 yielded 35 to 40 bushels per acre of corn, north of this windbreak on about sixty acres, while the rest of the corn which was altogether unprotected by any windbreak only yielded 15 bushels per acre and in the year 1927 similar results were gotten on the same pieces of land. These are concrete cases." "I have noticed this benefit practically every year that there has been any injury to a corn crop for all of the fifty-four years that I have lived in Nebraska." Another Nebraskan relates the following incident. "One time my brother and I were hired to husk corn for a tenant farmer in Fillmbre -county. A Honey Locust hedge bounded the south side of the 60-acre field and, probably because the first few rows next to the hedge showed a very poor stand of corn, the farmer told us to start at the other end of the field to husk his share of 40 acres. We also scooped the corn into the shelter and were paid for a little over 900 bushels. "The next thing we knew, the tenant had skipped the country, hav - ing sold his corn and leaving the landlord's share of 20 acres still in the field. Of course, the owner was wild, but he engaged us to husk the remainder of the corn. We also scooped his corn into the shelter and were paid for nearly 950 bushels — more than the tenant took off the other two-thirds of the field. "Undoubtedly, the tenant thought he was cheating the landlord when he chose the north end of the field for his share because the rows next to the hedge were almost no good; but he failed to look at the rows a little farther out in the field where the corn received the benefit of the hedge shelter." I have had more than one farmer tell me that in 1934 the only corn they had to husk was on the north side of a windbreak or grove of trees. A farmer of Douglas county told me that his crops were always better on the north of his windbreak and stated that some years he was obliged to turn around in his field when laying by corn because the corn in the protection of the trees was ready to lay by several days i </seg>
            <seg id="p518">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE before that farthest from the windbreak. His explanation for this was that the corn in the vicinity of the windbreak was protected from the cold winds which frequently blow from the south during early summer when the corn is just getting started and that the corn furthest from the trees was retarded in its growth as a result of the cold winds. Out in Kearney county last spring I came across a good illustration of the effect of trees in crop protection. Much of the wheat out there was blown out of the ground. Emil Pierson in the southern part of the county had an 80 acre Held of wheat a part of which was protected on the south by his buildings and farmstead windbreak consisting of several rows of Honey Locust trees. Except where the trees and his buildings furnished protection there was no wheat left to cut. Mr. Pierson wrote me after harvest saying "I cut fourteen acres of the field and it made one hundred bushels. There were about eight acres protected by the trees which I estimated yielded ten bushels and the balance of six acres which received protection from the buildings about three bushels to the acre. I believe if it had not been damaged by the rust the wheat that was protected by the trees would have yielded thirty-five or forty bushels to the acre." He said further, "I wish I had more trees." Think what the value of strips of trees would be in stopping snow from blowing off the fields and into road ditches and gullies where the water from this snow is lost for the benefit of future crop produc - tion and where it serves to make deep gullies deeper and swollen streams more destructive. Consider also what a world of difference it would make if our rural schools were protected from the wintry blasts by good windbreak plantings. An adequate planting would certainly result in a saving of fuel to keep the building warm and provide more comfort for the teacher and pupils. A planting composed of a variety of trees properly planted and cared for would have an educational advantage in that pupils would have an opportunity to learn much about plant life and would have a greater incentive to plant trees in future years. Then, too, such a planting might in time serve as a recreational area for the district. There could be no greater satisfaction to the public spirited citizen of a rural school district than to have planted or have given their support and influence in establishing a good windbreak as a protection for the school in their community. We hear it said that trees will not grow in many parts of Nebraska. This is not based on fact. Successful plantings can be found in every county of the state. Many of these plantings have withstood the drouth of the last few years and have produced seed which is used to grow </seg>
            <seg id="p519">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY planting stock that will be equally hardy. Some of the failures of the past have been due to a lack of knowledge of proper species, spacing of the trees too close together, the use of seed from a source which did not provide hardy stock or from failure to conserve soil moisture. As to species to be recommended, that is a little difficult to say as the conditions are so varied over the state. We have, however, been experiencing a drouth that has given us some ideas relative to certain windbreak trees. Broadleaf species which have proven generally successful throughout the state are: Honey Locust, Russian Olive, Chinese Elm, Hackberry, Box Elder, Russian Mulberry, American Elm, Green Ash and Cottonwood. The Chinese Elm on account of its rapid growth, resistance to drouth, freedom from insect pests and its habit of retaining dense growth near the ground has made it extremely popular with the farmers for planting in windbreaks. It seems to be the theory of a great many people especially in the eastern part of the state that Chinese Elm should be trimmed up from the bottom. One of its strong points as a windbreak tree is on account of its dense growth near the ground which breaks the surface winds. The Chinese Elm is the most resistant to iron deficiency or chlorosis of any of the broadleaf trees. This is somewhat important in many places in western Nebraska. The Russian Olive has proven itself extremely hardy and especially desirable for outside rows in windbreak plantings. Both Chinese Elm and Russian Olive may be planted rather close together in the row, say 4 to 6 feet. Another tree that has proven its worth as a windbreak tree in difficult situations is the Honey Locust. I note that this species came in for considerable praise at some of the early meetings of this society. Then there is the Hackberry which is a native of Nebraska and should be. planted in greater numbers. It is very hardy and one of the best of our trees for planting for shade and ornament about the dwellings and should be used more in windbreaks. It is rarely injured by wind or heavy snows. The Caragana which is a tall shrub, if planted close together, 1% to 2 feet apart, makes a good dense hedge for the outside row in the windbreak especially in west and north Nebraska. It is not so satis - factory for the south and east parts of the state. There are many other trees which I have not mentioned that are satisfactory for windbreak plantings. I wonder sometimes why we do not consider more the planting of such things as Buffalo Berry, </seg>

They will not only serve to help break the wind but will furnish pro - tective cover and food for birds and often supply food for the family. Among the evergreens which have given especially good satisfaction are Red Cedar, Western Yellow Pine, Austrian Pine and Jack Pine. Jack Pine is recommended especially for sandy locations. This species suffered severely in the southern and eastern part of the state in 1934 as did the White Pine and Spruce. Red Cedar is not recommended for locations where apple growing is important. In such places the hardier pines will grow and will not be detrimental to fruit trees. Evergreens should be planted on farms in greater numbers because of their distinct advantages over broadleaf species. They are longer lived, give better winter protection, stand hailstorms with less injury and add more beauty to the landscape. This, however, brings up a rather perplexing problem. Farmers say they cannot raise them. Many have tried the Clarke-McNary evergreen transplants with poor success while there are others who have grown them without difficulty. They do require a little extra care and attention especially in the matter of protection from the winds during the first summer after they are planted. Evergreens are slow in establishing themselves, the tops are not cut back to compensate for the loss of roots and unless they are protected, the transpiration of water through the leaves is apt to be greater than the roots can supply and the tree dies. We recom - mend that Clarke-McNary evergreens be set fifteen or eighteen inches apart in a nursery row running east and west. Then take some bur - lap sacks and split them lengthwise, drive stakes extending along the south side of the row far enough away to permit hoeing about the trees and fasten the strips of burlap to the stakes with the lower edge against the ground. This will break the wind and give the trees the protection they need. This protection combined with clean cultiva - tion should produce good results. After two or three years the ever - greens should be moved to their permanent location with a ball of dirt on the roots. Then we have the matter of spacing of trees which deserves serious consideration. I think that generally all over the state trees have been planted too close together in years past. The loss of a great many trees in 1934 was unquestionably a result of over crowding. In the fall of 1934 and spring of '35 one could see many windbreaks and groves of dead trees with only a fringe of green around the outside. In light of the results of the work done by Dr. C. C. Wiggans relative to the effect of trees on subsoil moisture we know that in those groves the subsoil had been robbed of most of the moisture as far down as the trees rooted and only those which could reach to the outside were able to get enough moisture to survive. </seg>
            <seg id="p521">513 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY I know of an 18 row windbreak of Honey Locust in Harlan county which was planted in 1908 six feet apart each way. Many of the trees were 25 feet high and when the county agent and I inspected this planting last summer we estimated that fully 85 per cent of the trees were dead. Here, as in many other cases, the trees in the out - side rows were practically all alive. Many trees died in plantings with some what wider spacings than the one just referred to and if more than two rows are used, a much wider spacing than is commonly used seems desirable if the trees are to survive over a long period. I saw a two-row Russian Olive wind - break that was planted 4x4 feet each way in Perkins county in 1920. It was in splendid condition when I saw it last summer. One row of Russian Olive or Chinese Elm and one row of some taller growing species, preferably of the hardy pines, would form a good crop shelter and since they could be planted rather close, they would not take a great deal of ground from cultivation. If more than two rows of trees are planted, and most farmers prefer and should have several rows, especially for their farmstead windbreak, then they should be planted farther apart. It is felt that rows 20 feet apart with a closer spacing in the row, say 10 to 12 feet, is none too far apart for the western part of the state. These spacings are based some what on recommendations of farmers in some of the western counties. Several demonstrations with spacings of this kind will be made in western and southwestern Nebraska coun-. ties next spring and it will be interesting to watch the results of these through the years. I know of a 5-row windbreak, seven years old, in Cheyenne county, that was planted in rows 18 feet apart and 12 feet apart in the row. It has been kept well cultivated and the trees are about fifteen feet high and in a very thrifty condition. It is a splendid windbreak and the owner is proud of it. This wider spacing will not only insure better results over a period of years and especially in times of drouth but will permit of easier cul - tivation with tractor and disc commonly used in that area. A closer spacing may be used in areas of higher rainfall and where the water table is in reach of tree roots. Rows of 12 to 16 feet apart with a closer spacing in the rows would be preferable to the much closer spacing commonly used. At first thought these spacings may seem to be unreasonable especi - ally in eastern Nebraska but I firmly believe that they will insure better success over a long period of years.

How many applications have you? A. At present we have applications for about 225,000 to 250,000 and we expect to have plenty of trees to supply the demand.

This borer, known as the flat-headed apple - tree borer (Chrysobothris femorata), ordinarily is not severe. I will attempt to tell you in my discussion why It has become so, and then what we know in the way of restricting it. The insect is known in the adult stage as a metallic wood borer. It is a flat beetle, usually about a half-inch in length and somewhat spindle-shaped. It gets its name "metallic" due to the metallic lustre, or reflection, from the body. The back is dark brown, spotted with Inconspicuous darker spots, which under certain light reflections has a brassy or coppery sheen. The under part of the body is bronze. In flight the beetles produce a buzzing similar to that of a bee. Beetles begin to emerge from their galleries in the tree trunks in early May and continue to emerge until the middle of September. The beetles are active, run rapidly, and take to flight readily. They are active during the heat of the day particularly on bright sunny days. They fly readily from the sunny side of one tree to the similarly ex - posed surface of another, the females depositing their eggs in the cracks in the bark. The egg is very inconspicuous. Most of us would not find them on the trees when we do not notice the -damage of the borers until they have the tree nearly killed. The larvae are known by the name that is most commonly attached to the species, viz., flat-headed borer. This name is given them because of the enlarged segment just behind the head which is flattened and has a large flat plate, or shield, both above and below. The head, in front of this segment, is small and black. Just behind the enlarged segment the body tapers off gradually. The </seg>
            <seg id="p525">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY ■color of the larva Is yellowish. These borers certainly do not have any resemblance to the beau - tiful, active, hard-shelled beetle. This is taken care of in the trans - formation stage, known as the pupa. The pupa is usually found deep in the wood of the tree, a whitish, pumpkin-seed-shaped, delicate thing, but showing the legs, wings, antennae, and other characters of the adult through the transparent covering. The life history, briefly outlined, is something as follows: The adult beetles appear from early in May throughout the remainder of the summer, disappearing during the latter part of September. All this time egg-laying is continued. It, of course, is at its maximum about July, when the beetles are most numerous and conditions are most ideal for their activity. Incubation of the egg requires normally 15 to 20 days, depending upon the temperature. Upon hatching from the egg the larva immediately burrows under the bark, where if con - ditions are farovarble, it feeds upon the cambium layer until cold weather. The borers that are practically matured when the weather begins to change in the fall, burrow directly into the heartwood of the tree. In the heartwood a pupal chamber is constructed in which the larva remains until spring, when pupation takes place. Three to five weeks are required for pupation. The younger ones will con - tinue feeding in the cambium layer for some time. A gentleman brought in a bottle of probably 50 such larvae about the middle of November, taken from the cambium of a large maple tree. Although this borer is known as the flat-headed apple-tree borer, it attacks nearly all kinds of deciduous shade, fruit and nut trees. From evidence based upon Departmental correspondence records, 23 •of the 64 reports received during the year 1935 have been on trees other than fruit trees. I question whether this indicates the percent of shade and fruit trees infested. Fruit trees usually receive more attention than is given a grove of shade trees. The latter is usually planted thicker than a stand will permit with a heavy mortality anticipated. The following is a list of trees in Nebraska attacked by the borer in order of abundance of reports in our record file, together with the number of reports. Apple (44), fruit trees in general (where no species was mentioned specifically ( (23), stone fruits (cherry, plum and peach) (7), all maples (13), elm (12), general farm trees (6), ash ( 4 ) , walnut ( 3 ) , pin oak ( 3 ) , hackberry ( 2 ) , and birch and cotton - wood (1) each. The current Farmers' Bulletin on the subject (F. B. 1065) lists: apple, pear, peach, apricot, plum, cherry, quince, currant, "walnut, pecan, hickory, Carolina popular, willow, weeping willow, beech, chestnut, oak, elm, hackberry, sycamore, mountain ash, service berry, bawthorne, redbud, sugar maple, soft maple, horse chestnut, linden, -Japanese persimmon, and boxelder as hosts of the species. Our Ne- </seg>
            <seg id="p526">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE braska list adds two or three species of trees to the host list given in the government bulletin. This would indicate that the list of kinds of trees infested is probably not exhaustive but simply depends upon the development in the tree of the proper conditions for infestation, coupled with adequate observation. Several of the tree species named are not grown in Nebraska, or appear in such limited numbers that if infested the infestations have not come to our attention. The statement made above concerning proper conditions for infestation coupled with ade - quate observation may be illustrated by reference to a statement made by E. R. de Ong in the California Cultivator for December, 1920. He says that drouth and high temperatures in the interior valleys of Cali - fornia have caused orchards in these valleys to suffer from sunburn, this in turn was followed by attacks of flat-headed borers. Mr. de Ong presents what to me is a unique theory of plant physiology in relation to drouth and the borer attack. "Trees suffering from drouth cannot evaporate sufficient moisture to cool their surfaces, hence they sunburn on the side where the sun's rays are the hottest. These areas harden, the sap ceases to flow freely, and growth is checked. This condition favors development of the borer." This same physiological result may be obtained in several ways. Felt and Rankin published an article in the Journal of Economic Entomology, page 45, volume 25, for 1932, in which they describe a condition in flowering dogwood in a drouth-afflicted area in which the bark had been scorched as a result of a slight woodland fire. • The trees were immediately invaded by the flat-headed borer. These statements bring me to a discussion of the conditions which have brought on our present serious borer epidemic. First, of course, is the pyramiding of a drouth condition over the entire Missouri valley region, which has been as severe if not worse in Nebraska than in other of the states affected. Felt and Rankin make the statement in their book on Insects and Diseases of Ornamental Trees and Shrubs that a sudden lowering of the water table in a woodland may cause con - ditions in the trees similar to excessive drouth, and so greatly reduce the vitality of the trees. I could exhibit charts showing the changes in the weather in Nebraska, or for isolated sections or localities in Ne - braska, during the past three or four years to prove my statement re - garding the drouth, but there is no delicate correlation between the amount of borer infestation and the degree of drouth. Consequently little could be demonstrated by such charts, and I feel that there is not a person but will agree that we have been going through a period that will be referred to in history as the great drouth of the 30's as much as it will be as a period of financial depression. I have indicated how drouth conditions and the lowering of the water table will reduce the vitality of trees and make them susceptible to borer injury. There seems to be almost a unified opinion among entomologists that the borer will not, or cannot, injure healthy trees. This preference is shown </seg>
            <seg id="p527">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY in the fact that the adults of the flat-headed borer will visit dead posts stuck into the ground, so much so that some authorities have recom - mended as a control practice in orchards the setting up of posts, to be painted with a sticky material to catch the adult beetles. However, it is reasonable to assume that, in the absence of dead or damaged trees, the beetles will deposit their eggs on healthy trees. The larvae of the flat-headed borer, in order to develop must enter and feed on the cambium, but if this is healthy and full of sap, the borers must turn back into the bark where they die a lingering death or remain for an indefinite period, eeking out a bare existence until for some reason the tree loses its vitality. Then the borer will take on new life and eventu - ally mature. Trees posses the ability, in varying degree, to produce conditions within themselves to resist insect attacks. Good healthy, rapidly growing trees suffer less from insect injury, even though more or less attacked by insects, than do trees of the same kind growing more slowly. Rapid growth has a two-fold action. First, it is due to the thrift of the tree that it is making rapid growth and this thrifty con - dition helps to ward off insect attack, and second, the thrifty condi - tion aids the tree in healing over more rapidly, insect damage that may have been started. The copious flow of sap in fast growing trees enables the trees to withstand insect attack. This flow of sap will drive out, or drown out, almost all of the cambium borers before they can be - come established in the tree. Older trees with well developed root systems, on well drained creek bottoms are least likely to suffer borer injury. Trees that have been growing on relatively low land with a high water table usually have an inadequate root system and are likely to suffer quite severely. Most susceptible of all are those arti - ficially cared for trees in our parkways and lawns, where water is applied artifically only in limited amounts. Trees in the parkways have a very limited area at best from which to draw their moisture. Young newly transplanted trees are most susceptible to beetle attack for several reasons. First, they have not had time to become estab - lished and conditions in them simulate drouth conditions, or the lowering of the water table, as has already been described, and second, such small trees usually have not made sufficient twig growth to cover and shade the trunk and main branches. This leaves these parts ex - posed to the sun and the borer, unless they are artificially shaded. The reactions of insects to light are very similar, to their reactions to temperature. These two factors are usually closely associated. Light is more important apparently than temperature, for the beetles of the flat-headed borer will remain inactive on warm cloudy days, whereas on warm sunny days they are very active. However, the adults of this species are affected by both light and temperature and they are found most active during the hottest part of the day and on the south or sunny side of the trunks of trees. The foregoing state- </seg>
            <seg id="p528">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE merits would indicate that the tree trunk must be unprotected or un - shaded in order to become infested and in fact that is actually the condition which lends itself most admirably to flat-headed borer in - festation. It is not entirely true, however, that shade will protect the tree, or parts of it from borer attack. I can ilustrate this from per - sonal observation. Last summer I was walking home one day when I noticed the sidewalk for a space of six or eight feet strewn with dead bark from a tree. Upon looking about for the cause of the litter, I discovered one of the lower, well-shaded branches of a large elm tree overhanging the sidewalk completely girdled by borers. The wood - peckers had located the infestation and had completely stripped the bark from the limb searching out the borers. I do not know why this particular branch was infested and others on the tree were not. It probably was as well shaded as any other part of the tree. The following example of a planting of seedling soft maples has come under my observation. The owner of these trees, a retired business man, planted them some six years ago. Three years ago the seedlings had grown so vigorously that they had to be thinned, so they were all dug and planted in four rows approximately a half - block long and about four feet apart in the row. Last summer the planting was allowed to grow up to weeds. The city cut the weeds as conveniently close to the south row as possible, but, due to the labor involved, the weeds were, left uncut between the trees. The trees were well cared for at the time of transplanting and though weather conditions were unfavorable there was a very good percentage of survival. There had been 32 trees planted in each row, I believe. There were two noticeably vacant places together in the first row and one dead tree in the fourth row, that I remember, but I was not looking for empty spaces and may have passed up some. Out of the approxi - mately 128 trees originally planted there are still 121 living. • A summary of the borer situation shows that of 28 living trees in the south row, 15 were infested with borers. These 15 trees had an. average of 2.25 borers per tree at an average height in the tree of between 3 and 5 feet. Of 32 trees in the second row, 7 were infested with an average of 1.5 borers per tree, the height ranging above 4 feet. Of 30 trees in the third row, only one was found Infested by a single borer. The north row, or row 4, included one dead tree show - ing a severe borer infestation. Only 4 of the live trees were infested showing an average of 1.5 borers per tree at a height above 5 feet. The most serious infestation was in the south row of trees and here the damage was done fairly low on the trunk. Evidently the south row of trees suffered more from hot winds than did the rows to the north. The cutting of the weeds exposed the trunks to the sun encouraging the borers to work closer to the ground level. Where the- </seg>
            <seg id="p529">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY ■weeds shaded the lower positions of the trunk the beetles worked higher up, where they were in direct sunlight. I have discussed the first of my two major reasons for the borer epidemic we are experiencing, that is, the drouth conditions in its various ramifications, and at considerable detail. The second reason, and these cannot be entirely separated for they are closely associated In many ways, is the great acceleration of the tree planting program during the past few years. This has furnished us with thousands of trees many of which are in an especially susceptible condition for borer damage, as I have previously pointed out. When I make this statement I do not wish you to assume that I am in any way trying to hamper the tree planting program. I am in favor of continued en - couragement of tree planting together with sufficient education or instruction to insure that the trees planted become established, or at least do not become breeding grounds for borers. It is too bad that such a program for tree planting as we have been witnessing in this state should have the brakes applied in the form of drouth and borer injury, effective four-wheeled brakes, I should say. In the case of an insect such as the flat-headed borer, whose life and development are so dependent upon low vitality of the infested trees, it is quite obvious that prevention of attack is much more important than control practices after infestation starts. The most logical method, of course, of preventing attack is to maintain the high vigor of the tree. This can be done under normal conditions by the use of fertilizers, and for our city trees with little growing space, the application of water by artificial means. The most satisfactory way to do this is to plant a few lengths of small tile in three or four places around each tree and water the tree through these tiles. This prevents surface evaporation on hot, dry days and places the water at a low enough level that the tree roots will be reached. It is quite obvious that these recommendations are not adequate for trees either affected by drouth or newly transplanted so their vitality is reduced. Such trees must have artificial protection. Mechanical protectors for quite young trees may be acquired by nailing two boards together in the form of a V, sharpening the two to one point at the end and driving them into the ground on the south side of the tree so that the tree trunk is shaded during the hot and bright sunny part of the day. These boards may serve also as supports for the trees to keep them growing upright. It is unnecessary to say that this method has limited application, both in number of trees to be protected and in height of heading of the trees. For an apple tree that is headed as low as possible it is satisfactory, but in the case of shade trees where the lowest branches are normally 6 feet high or more the practice becomes difficult of application. This practice </seg>
            <seg id="p530">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE purports to prevent borer attacks entirely by shading the tree trunk without the application of anything, either chemical or mechanical, to the tree trunk itself. Certain evidence offered in my paper would tend to prove that this might not be a 100% protection. In this con - nection may be mentioned the planting of young trees in the shade of older ones whenever possible. Another mechanical protection which I would be more favorable to is that of wrapping the tree trunk. The most ideal material for this purpose that I know of would be the burlap-paper sacks in which quantities of fertilizer are sold, particularly to the orchardists in the southeastern part of the state. I have heard the criticism that when these are used they prevent circulation of air around the tree and make conditions ideal for development of the woolly aphis on tree trunks. In that connection I would suggest that the ground be removed to a depth of about two inches around the tree. The protector should reach below the ground line any way. Then, after thoroughly cleaning the tree trunk to assure a good seal, and satisfying yourself that there are no aphids already on the tree trunk, apply a coating of tree-tangle - foot around the tree trunk at the crown, then start your wrapping. This should insure a perfect seal against the upward migration of the woolly aphids. Of course it would be well to examine the tree trunk under these wrappings occasionally during the summer. It is essential •with this type of protector that it be obsolutely free of tears or breaks for the adult borer beetles will locate such places and deposit eggs through them. This has been done repeatedly when only porous bur - lap was used as the wrapping material. Tough building paper has been suggested for wrapping but this would have no advantage over the burlap suggested. It would prevent circulation of air around the tree, be difficult to apply without breaks, would not fit closely, and so on. A paper which might be used is crepe paper of which the crinkles would allow for tight wrapping. It has been suggested that two thicknesses of crepe paper be used with asphaltum between. I believe I would prefer one of crepe paper with burlap, either sewed together or held with asphaltum. While these mechanical protectors are effective, if properly ap - plied, they may be too expensive to be used on more than a few trees. This would eliminate their use on small trees planted in wood lots or shelterbelts, or on very large specimen trees. For such situations a material to be applied to the tree trunk to prevent egg-laying would prove most satisfactory. This embodies the phase of chemical pro - tection and depends upon a material which is offensive to the borer - beetles being liberated from the tree trunk in sufficient quantity to prevent the beetles from visiting those trees. A material has been developed at Michigan which has proven almost 100% effective under their conditions after a test period of several years. Any chemical </seg>
            <seg id="p531">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY will have to be renewed at intervals during the season, the interval depending upon weather conditions. If it rains soon after its applica - tion, it may be washed off the tree and another coating would be needed. Hot weather will cause naphthalene to become more active than it would be in cool, damp, cloudy weather and so it will dis - sipate more rapidly. However, it is under these same conditions that its protecting fumes are most desired. The formula for this repellent wash is as follows: Common laundry soap 50 pounds Water 3 gallons Flake naphthalene 25 pounds Flour 2 pounds Place the soap in the water over steam pipes or other similar slow heat, and allow it to soften for a few days. Use a potash soap which will form a smooth mixture, not a soda soap, since the latter becomes jelly-like. Then place in a double boiler (a medium-sized wash boiler placed inside a large one works nicely) and cook until the temperature reaches 180°F. Stir in the flour and add the naphthalene and bring the temperature to 1SO C F., at which temperature the naphthalene will have melted, the melting point of naphthalene being 176°F.; then ■cool as quickly as possible, stirring the mixture occasionally. Cooling should be rapid to cause the naphthalene to crystalize in as small crystals as possible. You can readily see the possibilities of a mixture such as this. You may have only a few trees (25, 50, or 100) and feel that you ■cannot afford to make up such a lot of material. Neighborhood coop - eration on such a project could undoubtedly be aroused. The material can be made up in the winter time and placed in air-tight containers until time for its use in the spring and summer. At time of applica - tion it should be diluted to the consistency of thick cream and applied in as thin a layer as possible with a paint brush. Another, but probably less valuable wash, though it is also much more simple of preparation, is made in the following way: In 6 gal - lons of saturated solution of washing soda dissolve a gallon of soft soap, add a pint of crude carbolic acid, mixing well. Slake enough lime in 4 gallons of water to form a thick whitewash as it is added to the fore - going, and finally stir in thoroughly a half pound of Paris green. The most difficult problem that we have had to deal with is the problem of control, actually killing the borers after they have entered the tree. Too many people do not realize the importance of tree pro - tection and, after the tree is seriously infested, they want to know what can be done. In the past our chief recommendation was "worm - ing". This consists simply of a mechanical removal of the borers. </seg>
            <seg id="p532">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Such a procedure may prove rather severe to the trees, especially if the operator does not recognize the places where borers have been at work, and must cut and slash over the tree seeking borer excavations. All cuts should be made parallel to the tree trunk. If borers are found, they may either be crushed or moved as they are in the cambium. After they go deeper into the tree, a wire probe will aid in finding their galleries and destroying them, either by mechanical pressure of the probe, or by the injection of a small quantity of carbon bisulphide, or other chemical. But again the mechanical procedure is much too slow where a large number of trees are concerned and entomologists have been searching for a more practical method. Again Michigan has given a formula which, if properly used, will kill the borers without serious injury to the tree. This consists of a wash made of a solution of 1 pound of paradichlorobenzine (dichlorocide) in two quarts of raw cottonseed oil. This material should be applied in sufficient quantity to cover the darkened areas, indicating the burrows of the insect. If it is applied as a wash it may cause injury to the bark. Application should be at a time when the tree is not growing rapidly, either in the early spring or fall. Although the Michigan people claim that this material will penetrate deep enough to kill the borers in their winter cells in the heartwood of the tree, it seems to me that it would be much more likely to prove satisfactory if applied while the borers are still just under the bark. In addition to these control practices and repellent applications it is important to reduce as much as possible the number of borers that reach the adult stage. This can be done by clean culture. Of course where a tree is still living, and has a chance of recovery, save it by one of the methods already mentioned, but dead trees should be re - moved and destroyed. I have had several persons indicate by their queries that they thought since the borers were not in their cambium galleries they were gone and that destruction of the old tree would be of no value. The fact is that the borers have entered the heartwood of the tree and will emerge "en masse" in the spring. Our civilization has as its big mistake the selfish attitude that everything is worthless that. does not contribute directly to our well being. At the present time we are planting millions of young trees as a method of work relief, and to take the place of thousands of old trees that have been cut down. We are also cutting out and destroy - ing woodland underbrush. The cutting of old trees and underbrush removes the nesting sites of thousands of our birds. We have always taken a minor interest in our feathered friends. They have been very good and apparently quite obvious and abundant targets for our firearms. I have heard the statement made that you could not find a bird in Italy, that they have been the targets of guns there for so long that they have practically disappeared, and the ravages of insects </seg>
            <seg id="p533">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY in that country are enormous. We have taken the birds for granted, but we can thank the various kinds of woodpeckers and nickers for a job well done in the past from the standpoint of the control of the flat-headed borers. Of course they are not abundant enough to work an efficient control during an epidemic such as we have just been going through. I understand that the immigrant European Starling usurps the nesting sites of these native birds. Let's watch the Starling. Discussion Question: Is there any period in the life history of the adult beetle when it is vulnerable? MR. ROBERTS: There is no particular time. Adult beetles have a tendency to visit dead trees and stumps to lay their eggs and one might try painting these to attract and destroy beetles. I have here a can of "Tanglefoot" which has been found quite effective for that sort of thing. Q. What about whitewash? A. It has no value. Anything used must be a material which has a repellant effect on the beetle. MR. HOPPERT: I disagree with that statement, Mr. Roberts. Whitewash is of value in reflecting the sun's rays and thus keeping the cambium from being killed by alternate freezing and thawing in winter. This injury is usually called sun scald and occurs generally on the southwest side of the tree. Whitewash reflects the sun's rays and keeps the bark from thawing on warm bright days. Indirectly then whitewash tends to prevent borer injury. STATEMENT: I have had some practical experience. I white - washed some of my trees and some I did not. The whitewashed trees survived but many of the others did not. MR. ROBERTS: It probably had some value in that the borer naturally went to the trees that were not whitewashed. In the afternoon the Horticultural Society gave its allotted time to the Federated Garden Clubs of Nebraska. Mr. C. C. Wiggans of Lin - coln, presiding. MR. WIGGANS: We have asked Mrs. A. C.

            <seg id="p534">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE a flower show whether It is large or small because we know that the flower show is the peak of the activity of the entire year. The flower show not only creates a friendly and cooperative feeling in the com - munity but establishes a center of interest for the home and the community. The flower show is the most worth while, most con - structive, most beneficial both to the individual and the community of anything which the club can promote and when the homes are im - proved, the community is improved too. Every community needs backers and publicity for improvements and beautiflcation and they receive their first awakening at the flower show. People are seen at the show with notebooks and pencils taking down names and varieties of plants and ways of arranging them. All should receive new and correct ideas. Of course, there is lots of work to putting on a flower show. It takes an unlimited amount of time, but what is worth while in this world that doesn't take lots of work and time? We must always keep in mind that the object of the flower show is to encourage everyone to have a garden and to beautify their homes and com - munities. The show must be planned with this in mind. First of all, it is essential that we have unity. The keynote to success is co-operation. While the greatest responsibility falls on the manager of the flower show, it is necessary that every member give full and unbiased co-operation. We must have unity. There are certain appointments necessary to put on a show whether it is large or small. I have prepared what I call a list of the most essential chairmen and committees which should be appointed. First, General Show Manager. It is not necessary that this be the president of the club but it is customary for the ! president to ap - point this person. This is no place for a jealous or critical person. In selecting, be careful to get the right person for the place. For chairmen and committees, do the same. The following are the nec - essary committees: Schedule Committee Publicity Committee Judging Committee Registration and Entry Treasurer General Information •'. ■.'■-■: Staging Committee .. ■.. '_ Courtesy Committee Hospitality Committee Section Chairmen Now, I will take these different committees up separately and out - line the duties of each. Schedule Committee. Some sort of a schedule is necessary. You </seg>
            <seg id="p535">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY can have these mimeographed and should Include the rules which will govern all the classes which you intend to show. They may be divided into sections and those sections into various classes. Should be worded clearly and easily interpreted. This same committee takes care of premiums or the soliciting of prizes to be used. In selecting premiums, we do not believe in cash premiums but we do think that people who are interested enough to grow perfect flowers and help make a good show should be rewarded. Something pertaining to gardens makes a nice premium, plants or things used with regard to plant growth. We held a spring show. If possible, it is nice to have several dur - ing the year, perhaps a tulip show, a lilac, iris, peony, midsummer or late summer show, etc. The general principles apply the same to all. The classes to be used in this schedule depend upon what you have to display. If you have someone in your community who is especially fond of iris, make plans to include all classes of iris. Perhaps you have only a few classes. Arrange your schedule accordingly. Do the same with other flowers such as peonies, etc. Classes should cover forms, types, etc. Have classes for the various kinds of garden flowers blooming at the time of your show. Try to arrange for a class that could be used for any flower that might come in. Committee on Publicity. The chairman of this committee should be very wide awake and able to write up good information and get it to the newspapers. There are posters and various ways of getting the show before the people. Committee on Judges. This is rather a delicate problem. The judges must be well informed on the subject. The flowers must be labeled with closed tags so you get an unbiased opinion. The judges should be given a schedule beforehand so that they are familiar with all classes to be judged. At the time of the show, a secretary should be provided for each group of judges to record their awards but the secretary must be silent and have no voice in the judging. Committee on Registration and Entry. This committee has great responsibility and must have a world of patience. If the show is large, they must have plenty of helpers. This committee prepares the entry tags and receives the entries, labeling them properly, they also look after the identification of entries. One person may be appointed for this. People are interested in knowing the botanical names as well as the common names of flowers. Treasurer. The treasurer takes care of ticket sales and the ad - missions. Perhaps your club treasurer may have time to serve on this committee. Some people object to charging admission. I think it is wrong to put on a show without charging for it. Lots of work is re - quired and they should contribute to the expenses by paying a small </seg>

They should be stationed at the show to give put information and should take care of the attendance registry. We found from our registration that we had representatives from thirteen states and one from South Africa. Staging Committee. This is the big job. It may require several sub - chairmen, according to the size of the show. They must, among other things, arrange a proper background. The exhibits show up much better with the proper background. There are various ways of handling this. Two sub-chairmen might arrange for — General Decoration: Their duty is to make bare and unsightly . spots look well. Many flowers are brought in which are not entered but which may be used for decoration by this committee. I '•■•" General Labor: If your group is small, you may not find it necessary to hire any help. When the show is large, this is nec - essary and this committee takes care of that. Under this commit - tee come the tables on which to display the flowers and the con - . tainers for the flowers. These containers should be uniform, if possible. Milk bottles are sometimes used. There has been some objection to this but they are uniform at least and vases are not. This committee provides water for these containers. Someone should be appointed to make emergency runs. Perhaps some truck - ing has to be done, sometimes a watchman is necessary. Committee on Courtesy. This committee is important. They are just around the show and when people are confused, someone steps up and tells them where to go and what to do. A part of the commit - tee are called "Greeters". Their duty is similar, they mingle with the people at the time of the show and answer questions and help them to enjoy themselves. Committee on Hospitality. Most of the members are on this com - mittee. It is the very essence of the show. In Chicago, for instance, while attending their flower show, we were very tired and weary and someone stepped up, greeted us, and asked us to have a cup of coffee. We appreciated this so much and shall never forget that particular thing in connection with their show. A place may be arranged where people may sit and rest. Don't fail to have a "Hospitality Room" with a hostess in it. Your show should just ooze with hospitality and a feeling of good will. Section Chairmen: We will take the iris section. Arrange this according to how many you expect to show. Have correct classes in order to make it easy for the judges. Do the same for the various flowers. </seg>
            <seg id="p537">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY Arrangement section: This does not mean artistic arrangement, just arrangement. We need to study this more than any other one thing. Remember the arrangement must he simple as sim - plicity is the first essential to beauty. Containers should be ap - propriate to the flowers shown. Baskets are passe. They should never be used. Our judging sheets were as follows: 25 points for Distinction 25 points for Perfection of Arrangement including proportion and balance 20 points for Relation of Material and Container 20 points for Color Harmony 10 points for Quality and condition of material. General Management: Provide a place to hold the show. Should draw up a plan such as will produce the best general effect as you enter the room. This is very important. Each exhibit should be so arranged to give it the best advantage possible. Some people want a mass of color, some are interested in individual flowers, some in table arrangement, some in ways to use plants and flowers in an actual planting. If you have actual plantings, use great care in the construction of these gardens. Require that the plan to be used be censured beforehand to see that seasonal com - binations are correct, etc. Insist upon neatness and finish, never allow anything artificial such as artificial grass and green sponges for trees, etc. These gardens, If properly planned, are the most practical and instructive thing in the show. The tables to be used for specimen flowers must be covered. A white covering is very poor as it spoils the general effect. Black may be used but some incon - spicuous color is better. A lesson on the proper cutting 1 of flowers always proves popular at a show. This might include no|t only proper cutting but also the care of the flowers after cutting for best results. Always be conscious that your show is a civic affair, that it is a benefit to the city and the community and do not hesitate to ask the assistance of your business men, especially florists and nurserymen. At the close of the show, there is still a lot of work. There must be a committee for systematic dismantling. The water proof paper used in the show may be rolled up and used from year to year. Containers must be stored. The flowers must be disposed of in various ways, sometimes they are sold but more often they are given to hospitals or acquaint - ances who are ill. I have tried to give you what I thought was most important in managing a flower show. In closing, I will give you the thing I give my club — the spirit of the flower show lies in your spirit in bringing </seg>

Let beauty be our watchword. ■ MR. WIGGANS: I am sure if we all worked as hard as Mrs. Nelson that we would have a lot of successful flower shows in Nebraska. I now want to call on Mrs. Baker, member of the youngest garden club in the city of Omaha, for a report of her club. MRS. BAKER: I am so happy to have an opportunity to talk about .our club because we are not a year old, and feel that we have accom - plished a great deal. We have thirteen clubs in Omaha and every one of them has been so perfectly fine and assisted us in every way to get started so when I speak in a "braggy" way, the other clubs are not envious of us but treat us as their child. We have 120 members and 93 of those do not belong to any other club. We organized in Febru - ary last year in the Miller Park pavilion. We meet once a month at two P. M. and open our meeting by a salute and pledging allegiance to the flag. We have five officers, a publicity chairman and a courtesy chairman. We have a penny march to make a fund for cards and flowers. We also have a historian who keeps account of all activities. We have a membership chairman and a committee who calls every member about every meeting and asks for report of illness, etc. The Chairman of Hostesses has the care of property such as dishes and such things left in the pavilion. Twelve ladies act as hostesses for each meeting and each serve but once. We have a committee on constitution, a program chairman with two other members to assist, and we publish a year book. Each month's program is carried out according to the month and flowers for that month. For instance, in February we had a colonial garden and the flower of that month was the primrose; in April we stressed Arbor Day and the flower for that month was daffodil, etc. We have an exchange of flowers among members which has been helpful and a social hour at each meeting. We hold one picnic and one pilgrimage each year. We have a guest speaker and one or two members on every program. We study flowers in season and held a flower show in September. We studied rock gardens and arrangements, winter bouquets, planting and care of bulbs and we entered the Park Department contest. We carried on several civic enterprises, helped flood sufferers, etc. MR. WIGGANS: I am sure such a report will inspire other clubs in their future programs. Are there any other matters that need the attention of our group? Is there anyone who has anything to say for the good of the order? </seg>
            <seg id="p539">NEBRASKA STATIC HORTICULTURE SOCIETY Question: This afternoon there seems to be two distinctive ideas, one is to have one strong club and the other is to have several small clubs. Which is right? MR. WIGGANS: It all depends on your club objectives. The small club is of value mostly to the individuals, the large club to the com - munity. Omaha has that problem solved. They have a council of all clubs and yet they have the individual clubs. Are there any other things? Question: One of the outstanding objectives of the National Federa - tion is eradication of bill-boards and roadside beautiflcation. Could we have some information in our bulletins and any material that we can use in our individual clubs along this line? A few years ago, we went to the Atlantic coast and when we came back to Nebraska, we were ashamed of our highways after seeing the eastern highways. Such a campaign of roadside beautification has been started in Omaha and it seems to me to be a worthwhile project. Could we not get all clubs to thinking about this? MR. WIGGANS: According to Mr. Younkin of the State Highway Department, who talked this morning, such material will be available but, if it is delayed too much, it may not be of much help. With re - spect to the situation in Nebraska in comparison with eastern states, we must remember that our permanent road program is much younger, than theirs and we can hardly expect the same things they have ac - complished back there. The idea of improvement is undoubtedly a coming thing. I believe that the start -which has been made by the Highway Department in this state has been prompted to some degree by Garden Club people. </seg>
            <seg id="p540">RETOr.T OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE WEDNESDAY MORNING SESSION January 8, 1 !&gt;:!&lt;&gt;. Plant Industry Building — First Floor I MR. KIMMEL, President: If the meeting will please come to order, we will start our program. It is customary for the President to address the Society at the beginning of these meetings so if you will bear with me for a few minutes, I will give my talk here. First, I want to thank the Society for the privilege and honor of being President during the past year. It has been a pleasure to serve in this capacity and I hope I have done some little good. The activities of the Society for 1935 need not be given at this time as you will hear them in the Secretary's report. Another y&amp;ar has gone by .since our last meeting here. It is time to take stock ;of our position in the apple industry and decide whether or not we are satisfied with the results we have obtained this past year: or for the past three or four years for that matter. With our work and investments counting for very little, it is logical that we take some definite steps to help remedy this situation. The most important step which I am going to bring to your attention is not original with me but was recommended by your President, Loy Franklin, in 1931 and by your President. Mr. Banning, in 1934. The first step in re - lieving our unfavorable situation would be a Nebraska Grading Law. With such a law, it would be possible to stop unfair practices such as unfair comparing of prices from one orchard to the next without con - sideration for" grades: and misleading advertising. Many leading apple states have a Grading Law. It is now time that Nebraska follows suit, j At the beginning of a new year, it is a common practice for in - dividuals, business firms or corporations to plan what they expect to accomplish in the coming year. It is my suggestion that the Horti - cultural Society set up a target at which to shoot. This target could include INCREASED MEMBERSHIP in the Society, | further ELIM - INATION OF CEDAR TREES, and more CONCERTED ADVERTIS - ING. But along with these other things, it must certainly should include the UNIFORM GRADING LAW. With a target, it will be possible for succeeding Presidents of the Society to do some construc - tive work; more than just presiding at the meetings. There has been a place made on our program this afternoon for the discussion of a Grading Law and it is the earnest request of your President that every one be present for this discussion. The first topic on our morning's program Is a talk by Professor Tocum on "Why Fruit Cracks". Mr. Yocum. </seg>
            <seg id="p541">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY WHY FRUIT CRACKS Fruit cracking is a common experience with many kinds of fruits, as apples, peaches, plums, cherries and grapes. It has been unusually severe on apples in this section the last two seasons, especially on Stay - man, Winesap and Jonathan. This cracking takes place just before harvest time as the fruit is maturing. The explanations given for this phenomena have been rather gen - eral and indefinite in the past. Rains following drought periods cause renewed growth of the fruit and cracking often results. We have thought that the skin and outer tissue became fixed or set by drought and were not able to expand normally when the fruit began to expand. While this explanation may not be altogether wrong, still it does not tell us much regarding the internal conditions which predispose crack - ing, nor the external environmental conditions which induce cracking. . The experimental work and the explanation of cracking which I wish to review for you, is not mine. Full credit is given to Leif Verner of the West Virginia Experiment Station for a very fine piece of work, "A Physiological Study of Cracking in Stayman Winesap Apples". This is found in the Journal of Agricultural Research, Aug. 1, 1935. Any fruit grower would find it well worth while to read the entire article. But since you are not apt to see the article I wish to summarize it briefly for you. Careful observation has shown rhat cracking is extremely variable from season to season, in different orchards and varieties and even from tree to tree. Verner measured environmental conditions very carefully to see how they were related to cracking of fruit. After measuring rainfall, soil moisture content, air temperature, and the evaporating power of the air he concluded that "while weather con - ditions exert a major influence in the cracking of apples, it is apparent that physiological conditions within the tree or fruit, not directly related to current weather features, are also influential." From an analyses of the data several interesting things are found. There seems to be no relation between air temperature variations and the occurrence of cracking. Soil moisture content also showed no re - lation to cracking. He secured wide variations in soil moisture by sheltering the soil under a tree with a tarpaulin. After keeping off rainfall for several weeks this area was flooded. This sudden in - crease in soil water failed to produce cracking. Irrigation of trees during drought periods also failed to cause cracking of fruit. Heavy straw mulch also had no apparent effect upon cracking although it did increase absorption of rainfall and check evaporation. Rainfall did not affect cracking through the wetting of the soil, although it did have an influence in another way. During rainy pe- </seg>

            <seg id="p544">REPORT: OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE riods the leaves and fruit are more or less completely covered with water. It was thought possible that direct absorption of water through the leaf and fruit skin may be directly or indirectly influential in causing tissue strains that lead to cracking. To test this some fruits and foliage was protected from wetting by rain by covering a large branch with a tarpaulin when rain occurred. The fruits on this sheltered branch cracked just as badly and at the #ame time that fruits on adjacent unsheltered branches cracked. Another large branch on a Stayman tree was bent down into a barrel of water so that all the fruit and most of the foliage was submerged. This experiment lasted for four days and in that time severe cracking occurred on the submerged fruits, while on the normally exposed fruits there was no cracking. Other fruits were removed from the tree and kept under water for two days. The stems and calyx end of these fruits were sealed with paraffin, and the fruits were weighed before being sub - merged. After two days they were wiped dry and reweighed. The results were similar to those obtained from submerging fruits which were attached to the tree. Much cracking resulted and the badly cracked fruits showed relatively large gains in weight. From this and other experimental work and from a study of the weather data it was found that whenever transpiration, or water loss from the leaves and fruit, was stopped or was negligible for six hours or more, cracking of the fruit developed. Periods of rainfall which kept the foliage and fruit wet for several hours, and during which time the air was nearly saturated with water, caused cracking. How - ever, periods of high humidity without actual rainfall reduced evaporation of water to almost nil and cracking of the fruit followed. Periods of rainfall or high humidity which lasted for only a short time did not cause cracking. It seemed that about six hours of high humidity was necessary to produce cracking. Since there is so much variation in cracking even on one tree, it is evident that cracking of individual fruits must be determined not only by weather conditions but also by some internal conditions effective within the fruit when the weather is favorable to cracking. A study of the fruits was therefore made in an effort to determine the conditions ■within the fruit which were correlated with cracking. It was observed that in a great majority of cases the cracking began in a region marked by some abnormality or modification of the outer tissues of the fruit; that is, in regions of russet, scab lesions, sunscald, or unusually high coloration. These modifications were usually found on the side of the fruit that had been most exposed to sun, wind, and spray injury. It seems that the immediate mechanical cause of cracking is a form of tissue strain which develops in certain areas of the apple. The skin and tissues just beneath the skin are stretched excessively be- </seg>
            <seg id="p545">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY cause of enlargement in deeper lying tissues beneath this area. When weather conditions are suitable for cracking, it seems that the weakest surface areas are ruptured when the pressure outward exceeds the stretching ability of the outer tissue. So the formation of a crack is determined partly by the strength of the outer tissue of the fruit and partly by the amount of pressure exerted beneath. It was observed that, among trees and branches otherwise similar, cracking was more marked and more extensive when the foliage was sparse than when it was dense. This difference was perhaps related to the greater occurrence of sunscald, russeting, and intense coloration in the fruits of trees and branches with poor foliage. An effort was made to arrive at a better understanding of the varia - tions in pressure which develop in different parts of the apple. It is known that cell sap of concentrated solution has a greater pulling power for water, or will take up more water than that of weaker solu - tion. By freezing methods the investigator determined the density of the cell sap from, different regions of the same apple. Many compari - sons were made especially between samples from regions under normal skin and other samples from regions underlying areas of high colora - tion, sunburn, or russet. In some cases cracking had occurred and the comparison was between the tissues under newly developed cracks and sound areas of the same apple. Results were obtained from 52 different Stayman apples from 8 different trees. The tissues sampled from beneath modified or cracked areas of the fruit showed decidedly higher pressure values in almost every test than was derived from beneath sound and unmodified areas. Since high color, sunburn, or russet have been found to induce crack - ing, this remarkable internal pressure relation supports the idea that cracking results from excessive enlargement or excessive tissue pres - sure in local regions of the fruit. If other conditions are the same regions with high sap concentration should absorb more water, and so enlarge more rapidly than neighboring regions of lower sap density. Therefore the parts of the fruit which are marked by high color, sun - scald or russet cracks more readily not only because the surface may be weaker but also because great pressure is exerted beneath. When weather conditions provide a saturated atmosphere for several hours, the tree can easily get all the water it demands because little water is lost through the leaves. At such times the regions of the fruit with the highest concentration of dissolved materials, especially sugar, swell more and if the surface is too weak to withstand the strain, cracking results. The author does not give any means of avoiding cracking. But with a much better understanding of the causes of cracking some means may be worked out to reduce this sore trial of the fruit grower. </seg>

Does that explain why orchards in eastern states on the poorer soils have more cracking? MR. YOCUM: Yes, I think that would explain it. The same might apply to hilltops. Of course, on hilltops we would have a shorter period of high moisture saturation and this should cause the fruit to suffer less from cracking. . Q. Do these findings apply to all varieties of apples? A. Mr. Verner studied only one variety but our experiences have shown it would apply to all. We have seen it on Jonathan, York, Wine - sap, Black Twig, Wealthy and others. ' Q. What degree of humidity would you consider saturation point? A. Practically 100%, when no water is being given off at all. I believe' the air .is never quite saturated, but perhaps 98%. MR. F. SHUBERT: Mr. Yocum, do you have any remedy for this? We have a Staymen orchard at Shubert and we were under the impres - sion until just now that rains caused the Staymens to crack badly. They are very fine trees and they do that every year. The fruit is of very little value at picking time on account of this cracking. Is there a remedy? A. We used to think that with a uniform growing season we would not experience cracking. No, I do not have a remedy. Of course, if we would plant our Staymens on hilltops where we would be less apt to have a saturated atmosphere that might help. Development of moreleaves and foliage might help also. Q. Would an extra quantity of nitrate help? A. Yes, I think so". Of course, it would prevent high coloration and, therefore, less cracking. MR. KIM MEL: Some years the grapes crack badly. If the weeds were kept down and the vines well up on the trellis, would there be a tendency to reduce the cracking? A. Yes. The circulation of air between the vines would be better, and more evaporation would take place. Q. Would the planting of a cover crop such as clover help any by making the evaporation more even? i A. No, I can't see how that would improve the situation. In fact it might tend to aggrevate the situation by retarding circulation. </seg>
            <seg id="p547">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY Q. It seems to me we can't control the moisture but is there any ■way we can control the density of the sap? A. No, I don't believe we can. Q. In the east where they have 40 and 50 inches of rainfall in a season, do they have the same trouble? A. This report came from West Virginia and they seem to have a great deal of trouble with it there. MR. KIMMEL: Last year Jonathans and Missouri Pippins cracked badly around the stem. High coloration would not affect that. Q. This is a little off the subject but just what caused all the rus - set on the apples last season? A. Possibly the high humidity in the spring. We had quite a wet period when the fruit was small. Q. Do you think what we called frost injury might have been caused by humidity? A. We had little frost injury last spring. Q. How can you distinguish between these? A. It is hard to do so. Frost injury is usually in bands or streaks, the other type Is more generally diffused over the fruit. STATEMENT: Mr. William Porter of Nebraska City has had good results with Staymens and has not had any great difficulty with crack - ing except in the last two years. His orchard is on a hilltop and I wonder if the circulation of the air there might not have some bearing on this. MR. KIMMEL: I am sure all of us have appreciated Professor Yocum's talk very much. The next discussion is "Codling Moths in 1935" by Roscoe E. Hill of the Department of Entomology. Mr. Hill. THE CODMNG MOTHS IX 1035 By ROSCOE E. HILL, Department of Entomology. For the past eight years, the Department of Entomology of the Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station has carried on rather inten - sive studies of the broods of the codling moth at Lincoln. The original purpose and the continued purpose of this annual study is to gather data which may be used by the applegrowers of Nebraska as a basis for a better spray program. A good spray program, as you know, is one tn which there is a high degree of synchronization between the various </seg>
            <seg id="p548">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE sprays and the most susceptible periods in the life cycle of the codling moth. With each succeeding year the data gathered from the study of this pest emphasizes more strongly than before that the data of any. previous season or seasons cannot; by itself, be used as a satisfactory basis for the spray program that is to be followed for any single year. No two seasons are alike with respect to codling moth activity. As you no doubt remember, the 1934 season was marked by un - usual drought and heat throughout the country. These rather extreme conditions had a marked effect on the codling moth life cycle. Any one interested in the, effect of the drought on the codling moth should consult the article on that subject prepared by Professor Swenk, and published in the last annual report of the Nebraska Horticultural Society. The past season (1935) found the environmental conditions very much different and consequently the codling moth, through its life cycle, reacted quite differently to these conditions. It is my aim today to summarize briefly the codling moth life cycle as we found it in 1935 and to compare the data to some degree with that of previous years. I believe it will not be necessary to go into details concerning the definitions of life history terms, as these have been explained rather thoroughly on a previous occasion, and I Imagine most of you were present at. that time, or if not, that you are more or less familiar with the terminology. Mr. Hoppert tells me that what the entomologists call the "spring brood" the apple-growers in this part of the country call the "first brood", and our "first brood" is known by you as the "second brood", and so on. I had thought of using these terms as you know them best, but in view of the fact that the previous work on the codling moth here has all been recorded otherwise, I feel that it may still be best to use the entomological terms. A change now might only add to the confusion.. The most obvious and probably the most important thing noted in the 1935 codling moth season, as far as the apple-grower is concerned, was the "recovery" on the part of the pest. As you will see from data to be presented, the codling moth came out of its 1934 "depression" in great style during the past season. One of the noticeable results of the drought of 1934 was the great decrease in the codling moth popula - tion. This fact was brought out by the small bait trap catches late in the season and the scarcity of hibernating larvae under the bands in September and October and then again by the rather light flight of spring brood moths as shown by the bait and light trap catches of the past season. However, after considerable search upon several different days, overwintering larvae were collected from beneath the bands and placed in the cocooning racks by the middle of October, 1934. Of these, 33, or 22%, died during the past winter. This was rather </seg>
            <seg id="p549">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY a high mortality, though when compared with the mortality of 28% for the same period in 1933-34 is found to be somewhat lower. This difference is to be expected when we remember that a "wet" fall and winter favor the codling moth and a "dry" fall and winter is detri - mental or tends to increase the percentage of mortality. The fall and winter of 1934-35 was much more favorable for the survival of the hibernating codling moth larvae than was the same period in 1933-34. This fact can be made more clear by reference to the following table showing the relative mean humidity at noon, the mean monthly tem - peratures and the total monthly precipitation for the past two years, and by noting in each case the normal for the same periods.

This makes a total of 48' larvae to die, or a total larval mortality of 32% of those collected in the fall of 1934. The first of the larvae started pupating in the insectary on April 23, the peak was reached over a month later when 12 pupated on May 30. The last of the spring brood to pupate did so on June 24. This was a relatively early and long pupal period. Pupation was induced in April by the rising temperatures, but the cool, wet period during the month of May held the rate of pupation down and therefore prolonged the entire pupal period. With the exception of May, 1931, the precipitation for this month in 1935 was greater than for the same period in any year since 1909, and the mean monthly temperature of 56° has only been lower once in the history of the station, and that was in 1892 when it reached the low point of 54°. Of the 102 larvae which pupated, representing </seg>
            <seg id="p550">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 65% of the total number collected, 9, or 8.82%, died before producing moths. The remaining 93 pupae produced spring brood moths, these representing 91.18% of the total number of pupae. These 93 moths represent 59.18% of the total number of larvae collected in the fall of 1934, making the total mortality of the spring brood larvae and pupae 40.82%. The total mortality for the larvae and pupae was almost 83% for the same period in the 1933-34 season, or in other words only 17% of the individuals going into hibernation lived to produce moths. If we assume that the insectary conditions are a good indi - cation of conditions in the orchard, we may conclude that the small and greatly reduced codling moth population of the 1934 season came through the winter and spring in relatively large numbers (almost 60%) and served as the starting point for the building up of a large population of first brood moths. The average pupal period for the 93 spring brood moths was 23.3 days. The first moth of the spring brood emerged in the insectary on May 28, while the last moth to emerge did so on July 5. The first moth was captured at the bait trap on June 4, or almost a month later than in 1934, and 8 days later than the latest previous date (May 27, J.931). The peak of the spring brood emergences occurred In the insectary on June 19, when 12 emerged, although there were 9 em - ergences on each of three previous days — June 14, 16 and 17. At the bait traps the peaks of abundance of flying moths occurred on June 11 and 12. The length of life of the 53 female spring moths varied from 7 to 25 days, averaging 12.7 days, and of the 40 male moths varied from 5 to 20 days, averaging 13.2 days. This was a more or less normal life span for this brood. Eggs of the first brood were first deposited on June 10 by the spring brood, and the last ones deposited on July 6. The 53 female moths laid 2,740 eggs, of which 684 were laid on leaves kept in the jars for that purpose, and of these 684 eggs, 534, or 76.46%, hatched. This is a relatively high per cent of fertility (in fact, highest recorded here for the brood), and from this we are able to account, in part, for the heavy flight of first brood moths which came some time later. The first eggs of the first brood hatched on June 18, and the last one on July 8. The females of the spring brood laid an average of 51.7 eggs apiece, and from each spring brood female 39 first brood larvae de - veloped. A total of 940 first brood larvae were collected under the bands in the orchard between July 1 and August 3, with the peak coming on July 20. Of these 940 larvae, 36, or 3.83%, died as larvae, and 893, or 95%, pupated. Pupation of the first brood began July 4 and ex - tended until August 25. This was a more or less normal pupal period for this brood. Of the 893 pupae, 66, or 7.37%, died during the pupal period. The remaining 827 of the original 940 first brood larvae </seg>
            <seg id="p551">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY produced moths, this representing 88.08% of the total number of larvae. During the 1934 season only 45.32% of the first brood larvae collected produced moths. Thus we find a rather low larval and pupal mortality for the first brood (the lowest recorded here) — this also helps to ac - count for the large flight of the first brood moths. The average pupal period for the first brood moths was 8.9 days. The first moth of the first brood emerged on July 11, and the last one on August 28, in the insectary. This was again nearly normal. The peak of first brood emergence occurred in the insectary on August 2, although there was a smaller peak July 24, while at the bait traps the peaks of abundance of flying moths occurred on July 23 and 30, and August 9. The length of life of the 339 female first brood moths varied from 2 to 34 days, averaging 8.1 days, and the 490 male moths varied from 1 to 34 days, averaging 7.4 days. Second brood eggs were first deposited by the first brood moths on July 13, and the last ones were deposited on September 24. This seems to be the longest egg-laying period for this brood recorded here since the beginning of this study in 1928. This activity was prolonged no doubt by the period of cool, wet weather which came the last week of August and the first part of September. From the 339 female first brood moths, 29,582 eggs were secured, of which 3,459, or 11.68%, were laid on leaves. This is an average of 87 eggs per female. The period of heaviest egg-laying was from July 23 to about August 11. Of the eggs laid on leaves, 1,946, or 56.25% hatched. These hatched between July 19 and September 16. Although the egg-laying period, as we have already noted, extended to September 24, the late eggs of this brood were infertile and did not hatch. When the egg mortality is deducted we find that from each first brood female about 49 second brood larvae developed. A total of 793 second brood larvae were collected under bands in the orchard between August 4 and September 3, chiefly between August 11 and 24. Of these 793 larvae, 18, or 2.27%, died as larvae, while 370, or 46.53%, pupated. Of these 370 pupae, 19, or 5.12%, died in this stage. Pupation of the second brood larvae began on August 6 and extended to September 7. This again seems to be about normal for the codling moth in this section of the country. Three hundred and forty-nine, or 94.88%, of the pupae produced second brood moths. The average pupal period for this brood was 13.8 days. Pour hundred and five of the 940 second brood larvae went into hibernation or overwintered. Although over 300 larvae were collected after September 3, none of them pupated. The first moth of the second brood emerged on August 16 and the last one on September 17, in the insectary. The peaks of the second brood emergences occurred in the insectary on September 6 and 13. </seg>
            <seg id="p552">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Also at the bait traps, we got one peak on September 6 and the other on the 12th, or one day sooner than In the Insectary. The last moth was captured at the bait traps on September 30, although the traps were attended until October 11. The length of life of the female second brood moths varied from 2 to 40 days, averaging 16.4 days, and the male moths varied from 3 to '46 days, averaging 20.3 days of life. The eggs of the third or wintering brood were first deposited on August 20 and the- last one was deposited on October 3. The 157 female second brood moths laid 17,767 eggs, of which 3,510 were laid on leaves. Of these, 2,721, or 77.52%, were fertile and hatched. The average number of eggs laid by each female of this brood was 113, and as 77% were fertile, each female may be said to have given rise to about 87 larvae, but it is very unlikely that a very large per - centage of the larvae hatching during this hatching period (August 2 7 to October 6) developed sufficiently to overwinter successfully. The data I have presented seems to show that the past season (winter months of 1934-35 included) was a highly favorable one for the codling moth in southeastern Nebraska. Although the spring brood was greatly retarded by the cool, wet May, the weather condi - tions of the latter part of June, throughout July and most of August and September were quite favorable for codling moth development. The high temperatures of the latter part of June and of July speeded up the codling moth life cycle so that in most respects the first brood appeared in, numbers at about the normal time. The cold, wet period during the latter part of August and first of September practically arrested moth development and the emergence and flight of the second brood occurred later than normally. Of the years during which this study has been in progress, the 1931 season most nearly resembles the 1935 season. Here again the spring brood was relatively late getting started, due to cool temperatures dur - ing the month of May. The weather conditions of June and July were similar to those of the past season, and the peaks of both the spring and first broods occurred at approximately the same time in these two years. In 1931 the second brood was earlier because of the con - tinued favorable weather conditions in August. In closing, I might say that all indications seem to point to a heavy flight of spring brood moths next season. The indications of this as I take it are: 1. The late activity of the moths in September and October. 2. The large numbers of larvae that went into hibernation. On January 4, I made a rather superficial examination under the burlap bands about eight trees in the college orchard, and counted </seg>

These figures are rather significant when compared with the total of 150 larvae that were secured only after considerable search in the fall of 1934. 3. The favorable weather conditions that have obtained to date — especially during October and November when the precipitation — was above normal for this period. Such conditions send the larvae into hibernation in a condition favoring survival. Therefore, it appears that the apple-grower would do well to try to achieve a high degree of effectiveness from his early sprays, as this will be the paramount factor in determining whether the next apple crop will or will not be a "wormy" one. We can only hope that most of the moths will come out of hibernation at nearly the same time so as to concentrate the broods and thus somewhat simplify the spray job throughout the whole season. Discussion Q. What would be the effect if the thermometer went down to -20° or -30° this winter? A. I think there would be some benefit from it. DEARLE BAKER: May I ask again your date of the peak of the first group? MR. HILL: August 20th. Bait traps July 23rd, July 30th and August 9th. The real peak came on the last five days. DEARLE BAKER: Our peak was between your dates. In your spring emergence, your peak was three days ahead of ours but your second one was just about with ours. PROFESSOR SWENK: The point brought up about winter survival should be emphasized. The codling moth larvae are prepared to with - stand low temperatures. MR.

            <seg id="p555">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY REPORT OP THE SECRETARY E. H. HOPPERT Winter Meetings. The activities of the Nebraska Horticultural Society for 1935 began with the annual meetings held at Lincoln, January 2, 3, and 4. The Proceedings were published in the sixty - sixth annual report which has recently been distributed to the mem - bership of the Society and to the various libraries of the state. Dur - ing the business session the Society passed a resolution asking the State F. E. R. A. officials to sanction an orchard sanitation project in those counties where commercial orcharding is an important industry. Orchard Sanitation Project. The Secretary conferred with the State Works director, Mr. Carnahan, following which a definite sanita - tion project was submitted and approved. Then the project was ex - plained to the county F. E. R. A. directors in Otoe and Richardson counties. Nemaha and Cass county orchardists would have co - operated in a similar undertaking but these two counties had no county F. E. R. A. set up. Under the cooperative agreement the orchard owners or operators were to furnish the tools for scraping trees, removing dead limbs and dead trees. They were to instruct the workers in the details of these various operations and to furnish a supervisor for each crew. The workers would be transported to and from the orchard by the county office and they would be paid out of F. E. R. A. funds allotted to the county. The purpose of the work was to remove hibernation places and breeding places for insects like the codling moth and plum cur - culio; trees harboring diseases like blister canker, black rot, blotch, cedar rust, could be treated or removed. The work was not to be confined alone to commercial orchards. A survey was, to be made of all the home orchards within a radius of two miles around commercial orchards. The owners of these smaller orchards were interviewed and their cooperation secured where possible. The sanitation project was adopted in Otoe and Richardson coun - ties as previously stated. By the middle of April approximately 1600 acres of orchard were treated. This acreage comprised between 70, - 000 and 80,000 trees. Work was provided for about 40 men in each of the counties for about 2% months. The F. E. R. A. workers did not replace regular orchard help to any great extent. They did things that probably would have been neglected or put off until more pros - perous times. The regular help was busy with the regular pruning work. It is difficult to estimate the benefits accruing to the orchards from this sanitation project. There is no question, however, that it </seg>

The Board at its meeting in June discussed the matter of cooperating with our neigh - bors and decided to sponsor one-half day session. Since moisture studies in orchards were rather new it was felt that this subject would be of interest to orchardists in our sister states. It was decided there - fore to have Dr. C. C.

            <seg id="p558">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE pression. The per capita consumption of apples on the other hand, has shown a steady decline. The medical profession, home economics teachers, etc., have helped to make citrus fruits more popular. But the constant advertising of citrus fruits has had much to do with the popularity of these fruits. The American Pomological Society has sponsored a new apple advertising organization called the "National Apple Institute", organized to sponsor increased use of apples. The Board in its June meeting voted to support the new organization with a contribution of $50 to help get the program under way. Later it Is hoped the growers will see the advantages of such a movement and give it their financial support. The National Apple Institute (H. E. Barnard, Secretary, 225 Wein - mer Bldg., Indianapolis, Ind.) has been sending out news items, radio announcements and recipes. It needs the active support of the growers to accomplish what it set out to do, namely to popularize apples among the consumers. It is hoped that our Nebraska orchardists will help with their financial as well as their moral support. CHAIRMAN KIMMEL: What is your wish regarding the secre - tary's report?

            <seg id="p560">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE MR. SIMPSON: Nothing especially new. MR. HOPPERT: Perhaps we can talk more about the codling moth. Let's hear from some of you who used oil last year. LOY FRANKLIN: I believe it was fine. To me it appeared that the worms were really stopped after the oil spray was applied in August. MR. HOPPERT: What kind of oil did you use? MR. FRANKLIN: Orthol-K. I used it at % % and put on two applications, using Lead Arsenate with it, 2 pounds to 50. MR. HOPPERT: Some have been using tar soap flakes in the late cover sprays as a spreader. Ordinarily, there is lots of drip but with the use of these flakes, there is very little. The soap causes the spray to adhere to the fruit and makes an even covering. Some states are using what they call "spreaders" but experiments don't seem to in - . dicate that they are very effective. I wonder how many felt that the control measures were more ef - fective this year than in 1934. GROWER: My experience was that in 1934, it was almost im - possible to control the worms. The early broods this year were very easily controlled. In the Weaver orchard at Shubert the young trees were sprayed only once and we found Ganos that had 5 to 8 stings but not a single one had gotten into the apple. Evidently, the one spray was sufficient. The wet season was unfavorable for worms and then we got good control from spraying. DEARLE BAKER: I thought we had better control this year than the last two years. Of course, we couldn't compare 1935 with 1934 but comparing with 1.933, the rainfall was about the same. I had good control on Ganos and Ben Davis this year but I think we did not use a strong enough application of oil on the second brood. As it was, we only got about 40% or 50% effect. Naturally, we got lots of stings. On one tree a year ago, we counted the worms under the bands. We counted 700 worms under the first band. We used two sets of bands and counted over 400 under the second band. This was in 1934. This fall we counted the same tree and had only around 300. This proves we are getting control. Q. When are bands put on? A. The first week in June to catch the first brood. Q. How long will the first brood of worms be coming out? MR. HOPPERT: That varies considerably with the season. If the weather holds them back, they may come out all at once. Some- </seg>

            <seg id="p562">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON SESSION January 8, 1036 Plant Industry Building — First Floor Meeting called to order by President/ Mr. Klmmel. MR. KIMMEL: There are only a few here but it seems best to go ahead with our program. We have first Professor E. S. Fullbrook of the College of Business Administration who will talk on "Advantages of Standardizing Products for Market". Professor Fullbrook. MR. FULLBROOK: You will notice that the topic that has been assigned to me is one that deals with thei general advantages of stand - ardizing goods for market as applied to any commodity. I know nothing in particular about apples but will discuss the topic in general. Discussion ■ MR. KIMMEL: Are there any questions you would like to ask Professor Fullbrook? GROWER: Five, six and seven years ago, people were much inter - ested in buying first-class apples and willing to pay the price but since the depression they seem to be willing td buy a grade of apples which are poorer. We are almost forced to make that sort of a pack. Should we follow the original standard year after year or make the pack that people want? MR. FULLBROOK: The problem that you speak of is one that is found throughout the field of production and distribution. Retail and department stores say the same thing. During the depression, peo - ple wanted something at a low price and sacrificed quality to get it. If people insist on buying a lower grade of merchandise, you can fur - nish it to them but label it as such and still maintain your old standard quality. I do think it is desirable to keep the standard that has been set. If standards are changed every time that economic conditions change, then your standards lose the thing that they are expected to accomplish. MR. KIMMEL: The point is, as I understand you, if we are mak - ing a #1 Pack, to keep that pack the same year after year; but if people want another grade, make that but sell It for just what it is, a combination pack with cheaper grades mixed in. MR. FULLBROOK: Yes, do not change your grade that has already been established. If inferior merchandise is sold as standard merchandise in depression periods, then the confidence of the buyer in the standard brand is undermined. Q. It is difficult to standardize a pack of apples. You have such </seg>

People buy so much by appearance and are willing to pay a little bit more for it. I am not at all familiar with the grades used in apples It is true in some fields that standards set have been rather what the growers would like to promote rather than a practical one. It should be a practical one that can be measured up to. I think it is going to be impossible to get away from the fact that apples standardized ac - cording to a definite standard will still make it possible for some to of c^lor PrlCe thEn OthelS&gt; P ° Ssibly beca «se of that matter qualUy a °°aln° U "^ Pe ° P ' e *"' ** t0 "^ P ° lnt ° f W&amp;nting high A. Oh yes, it is coming right now. Dealers say people are al - ready begining to want better merchandise. MR KIMMEL: Thank you, Professor Fullbrook, for your splendid talk I wish all of our fruit growers could have been here to hear it Grading and standardizing are things we are going to consider very seriously in the next few years. I will now turn the meeting over to Mr. W. B. Banning for a Round Table Discussion of "Grading and Marketing Problems". MR. BANNING: Chairman, Fruitgrowers:— The Nebraska fruit growers have many problems. It is no easy matter to grow good quality fruit. But it seems even more difficult to market that fruit , f fc ' a ir T 1Ce - M ° St ° f these t'ouWs can be laid directly at the door of the Nebraska growers. We have no system of grades and no system of marketing. We allow our market to be taken from us by fruit from the south and from the west. That ought not to be the case We grow as good apples as they do anywhere else and they have as good flavor; yes. even better than the western apples. Nevertheless, our market is taken away from us right under our noses by these other sections. Professor Fullbrook mentioned one of the principal reasons namely standardized grades. Nebraska growers evidently believe in </seg>
            <seg id="p564">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE rugged individualism. Because each grower seems' to put out a grade or series .of grades different from his neighbor. One grower will use the letters of the alphabet, another will use numbers. Then some others use words like "Commercial", "Fancy", "Utility", etc. If this is to continue then by all means send your code to the buyer so he knows •what you mean by the number, letter, or word. It would be much better if all of our growers would use the same letter, number or word for similar grades. Let's get together and straighten this out. Two years ago I introduced a grading law in the legislature but some of our own fruit growers objected to it so it was killed in the House committee. I know we will get what help is necessary from the whole - salers for George Burt and Mr. Staley of Lincoln have told me that they are in favor of such legislation. I know we are at present the dumping ground for the culls from our neighboring states. During the past fall I have had my inspect - ors at ports of entry along the state line examine each load of fruit among other things. It is surprising how large a per cent of these loads that come in are the cheap grades. That may not be the fault of the growers entirely. I presume it is largely because the trucker is anxious to handle cheap apples. If they are not washed then we send them back because we have regulations permitting us to do that. If they are washed and are not above the tolerance in residue then we have to let them in. If now we had a grading law applicable not only to imports but also to our own growers, then we could legally keep these culls out. MR. KIMMEL: What should we do about it? Do you think Ne - braska should have a grading law? MR. BANNING: Yes, I certainly do — if marketing conditions are to improve. I would like to see the growers get together, talk these matters over and then decide on what the specifications for the various grades should be. The new legislature doesn't meet until 1937 but in the meantime I shall try to establish rules in Nebraska so that out - siders have to comply with them. It is largely the small grower in this state who is responsible for advertising low grade apples as "Fancy" or "Extra Fancy". His fruit must be graded the same as that of the larger grower. MR. KIMMEL: I talked with Mr. Lobenstein who was formerly Extension Horticulturist at Kansas regarding the Kansas grading law. (The bill introduced by Senator Banning was*-modeled after this law.) The Kansas law is virtually inoperative because the enforcement of its provisions is left in the hands of the local county attorneys. Mr. Lobenstein felt that the Kansas law would be much more effective and highly satisfactory if the State Department of Inspection had charge of its enforcement. </seg>
            <seg id="p565">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY MR. BANNING: The Department of Weights and Measures would handle the enforcement in this state in connection with the ports of entry inspectors. There would be no new enforcement crew necessary. GROWER: I think there should be an effort made to simplify the grades. We have been using somewhat similar to the Federal grades but have been calling them "A", "B", and "C". I don't think we need a lot of additional grades like "Utility", "Domestic", etc. If the apples run unusually well colored we could call them "Fancy". There cer - tainly should be no more than five grades. MR. BANNING: That would be about right. Usually we have need for only three grades but it would be all right to have two addi - tional ones to provide for years when we have unusually good quality or unusually poor quality. A grower, to stay in the business, will have to sell his apples when scab or hail hits his crop. GROWER: I don't think we should always condemn the trucker. Trucking has become a definite mode of transportation. It has much to recommend it. Of course there are some bad features about truck - ers. But why condemn the whole class. It looks as though our mar - keting problems have changed considerably since the truck came in. Now we'll have to adjust ourselves to the times. Let's make it much more difficult for him to dupe the public by buying culls and selling them for "Fancy". Perhaps we can drive the shyster out of that business and develop our markets to better advantage through the good business-like trucker. MR. HOPPERT: This proposed bill should provide that the packages must carry the name of the orchardist who packed the apples, whether grown in this state or in some other state, — the grade and the minimum size. Then if any one is to blame it will probably be the grower. Another thing that might appear on the basket, particularly for the extra fancy grade, is the approximate number of apples con - tained in the basket. Many retailers of fruit sell the fancy eating apples by the dozen and with the number indicated the grocer could readily determine his selling price by the dozen. Those growers who have grading machines could easily do this by counting the apples in 5 or 6 baskets. Q. What about apples sold in bulk? A. If they are bought in bulk from the grower and then sold in bulk to the consumer the only thing to watch is that the retailer does not misbrand. If they are sold as fancy then they would have to conform to that grade or the seller would be committing a mis - demeanor. The various terms used would be denned in the law and growers and retailers or wholesalers who sell apples would have to •conform to it. If apples are bought in bulk and repacked they would </seg>
            <seg id="p566">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE have to be so labelled because they must contain the name of the grower if sold in closed packages. Q. How about selling these loose bushels containing only 38 or 40 pounds? Many stores advertise these loose packs as bushels. Since they contain 6 to 10 lbs. less than packed bushels naturally they can sell for 15 to 20% less and still make the same profit. A. We have been checking up on such practices. This matter can be handled under the present law. Q. Do you think it would be advisable to use in addition to the required marking a brand of our own? A. Yes, if you have a large orchard and wish to develop a name for your own orchard. Q. Do you favor a record system for each truck load the grower sold? A. Yes. A certificate showing just what the load contains signed by the orchard manager or his representative would be a fine thing. If some of you want to get together and work out some rules to follow I will be willing and ready to cooperate any time. Until we can get this in shape for a law, we can use only the rules set up by the Department of Agriculture. Q. If 75% of the growers agreed on a packing standard, would your Department have the authority to carry it out? A. We would try and I believe it could be done. If you want to appoint a committee to agree on grades, I will be glad to call them into my office and help work it out. MOTION: Mr. President, I move that the President and Secre - tary of the State Horticultural Society be authorized to appoint a com - mittee of fruit growers to work with Mr. Banning to standardize packing. MR. KIMMEL: Is there a limit to the number to be on this com - mittee? STATEMENT: No, whatever number seems necessary. MR. KIMMEL: It seems to me we should limit the number to three, five or seven members for better work. S STATEMENT: I will amend my motion to read "not more than seven members". Motion seconded, and carried. MR. RABEN: Why does the state have to be in competition with commercial growers? The state uses more fruit in their institutions </seg>

            <seg id="p568">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE THURSDAY MORNING SESSION January 0, 1 ?»:»&gt;. MR. KIMMEL (President): The meeting will please come to order. The first talk on this morning's program is by George Marshall of Arlington, Nebraska who will talk on "Experiences with the Dam Lister". Mr. Marshall. MR. MARSHALL: Mr. Chairman, Gentlemen. If it had been Clayton Watkins who had gotten out the program, I would have thought he gave me that subject on purpose but as long as it was Mr. Hoppert, I decided he only wanted me to do his swearing for him. No one has had much experience with the dam lister as yet. We have had ours only one season and, at the College at Ames where we got the idea, they had used it only a short time. It is a very simple machine, simply a pedal wheel which drags behind the lister and, after the lister has planted the row, this pedal, being attached to lugs on the lister wheel, trips over every two feet and drags up the dirt and makes a little dam. It was originally made to use when planting corn and the idea was to hold the moisture that fell and let it soak into the ground. Mr. Collins at Ames told me he got 9 0 bushels of corn to the acre where this was used and 40 or 50 bushels elsewhere on the farm the same season. The next season they used it, it was very dry and no difference was noted. ■ ■ i We had been hunting for some Implement for the orchard that would hold the water where it fell. We had tried a scraper and a plow but this was slow and therefore too expensive. When we heard of this "Dam Lister", we went over to see it work. We thought it would be just the thing for our orchard. They were using it in the field and we took some notes and measurements and came home and made the machine which some of you saw at our place. Ours is really simpler than the one at Ames. Ours trips every one-half round of the wheel by means of a little lug on the axle. It is simple and it is effective and, from the orchard standpoint, I think it is the only thing we have ever found that is practical. The California machine, "Killefer", makes about 9,000 holes to an acre. I saw it work at Albion but it costs too much. I also thought it pulled too hard. An ordinary tractor would not pull it. They had a large Caterpillar on it. It was well made but had lots of machinery to it. It looked like it might turn a 1*A" or 1%" dashing rain but it didn't "honeycomb" the ground enough to suit me. The one at Ames was more what I wanted. It could be put on a 2-row lister. They have one in Kansas which drags independently behind a single row lister, I believe. </seg>
            <seg id="p569">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY Some of these fellows who have studied moisture in the ground found that very little of a rain soaks into the ground even if it is a slow drizzle. A year ago last summer, we lost trees here and there through our orchard and when we came to dig around them we found that where they died the ground was dry two or three feet down but it was motet elsewhere. It was the contour of the ground which held the moisture in some places although we couldn't notice so much difference n contour. What we have to work out is somthing to keep the mois - ture right where it falls; then it is distributed evenly and I believe we will find that the same amount of moisture will do a whole lot more good than it has in the past and we will also save the soil from When we first came to this country, many of our little creeks ran all summer long because they were fed by springs. As more of the ground was cultivated the creeks were filled up with washed dirt and the ""&gt;i8ture lost by run off, which previously was caught by the native sod and fed into springs. Present conditions, I believe, are a result of that I believe 95 % of those springs are gone. You young fellows can hardly believe that. The management of the soil has done that and nothing else. We are getting about the same amount of rainfall we used to Records show that it doesn't vary much over a long period of time but, after a series of short rainfall years, these things are more noticeable. With no surplus moisture, these dry seasons put the finishing touches to wl T e * t \ TM"r h3S C ° me - Wh6n We mUSt flgure out something. We want to talk about it and think about it and, I believe, it is up to the orchardlst as much or more than to the farmer to figure out some way to save these trees. This "Dam Lister" is cheap, practical and may be used to plant corn as well as cultivate the orchard. Discussion Q. Do you think it would work everywhere? I was afraid to break up my ground in the orchard for fear it would wash. MR. MARSHALL: We had only one dashing rain after ours was put in last year so I can't be sure but it didn't wash to speak of that time. Of course, in some places in the draws it washed some but not as much as where we didn't use the machine. The water seemed to lay just where it fell. I think if we cultivate the orchard, it would be well to cultivate with some such machine. With a soil like ours it will absorb a lot of moisture if it comes slowly but a dashing rain is lost. I am sorry that we did not keep more data on this but we are sure it is a practical, usable thing and we intend to keep it in use In the spring, as soon as we can get around to it, we are going to start it and use it all summer. Q. What about getting in to spray? </seg>
            <seg id="p570">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE A. I haven't figured that out yet. Q. What would you think of listing every other row, particularly across the hills, leaving one row in which to drive the sprayer? A. That would be much better than not using it at all. Q. How many times do you cultivate during a season? A. Depends upon the season and how falst the weeds grow but twice anyhow. This machine, of course, will cover up a lot more weeds than an ordinary cultivator. Q. With a rough surface such as this lister leaves, the weeds couldn't be mowed, could they? A. No. Use the lister again. Q. How does the ground have to be prepared to use it the first time? A. No preparation necessary, just ground that has been in cul - tivation before. Q. What about big weeds? A. It will work wherever a two-row corn lister will work. Q. Doesn't it choke up? A. No, not at all, it rolls over the weeds. It might not create a complete dam where there were heavy weeds but it wouldn't choke up. One of the important things, of course, is to create a complete dam. I think the paddle should be plenty wide and take dirt off the sides instead of the bottom of the ditch. Q. How does it work for corn, George? A. I didn't hear this year from Ames but Collins, the man who had used it the seasons before, was well pleased with it. Q. I mean in the way the corn is planted. You can't plant corn on top of that dam. A. Oh, No! . The corn is planted before the dam is made. You simply add this paddle wheel behind on ordinary lister and the corn is planted just as before. The number of lugs on the wheel governs the spacing of the dams. When the corn is cultivated, of course, the dams are torn down a little each time and by the time the corn has been cultivated three times, they- are all torn down. In an orchard, of course, you split your ridges each time and do not tear down the dams. </seg>
            <seg id="p571">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY MR. KIMMEL: I am sure all of us have enjoyed this talk and I think we will have to follow the suggestion to give more serious thought to holding moisture in the orchards. Our next talk is "Borers and Red Spiders" by Raymond Roberts of the Department of Ento - mology. MR. ROBERTS: Gentlemen, I feel very much out of place here this morning discussing a subject before a group of men who have had actual, practical experience with these problems and to try to tell you something about how to do things which you have already figured out for yourselves pretty well. Perhaps the best thing for me to do is to merely open up the discussion and then give you a chance to exchange ideas. THE RED SPIDER (TETRAXYCHUS TELARIUS LINN.) A Paper Presented to the Fruit Growers' Section of the Nebraska Horticultural Society. By RAYMOND ROBERTS, Department of Entomology. There has been a great deal of misunderstanding in the literature written on red spiders. Such is usually the case with minute animals that are very common and also very injurious. This is accentuated by the multiplicity of food plants of this cosmopolitan species, as well as the variability of its own color and markings. It is sufficient for the purposes of this paper to say that whenever the under surface of the foliage of plants is covered with a fine web and very tiny vari - colored mites are seen crawling around under this webbing, the species is our common red spider Tetranychus telnrius. The color of red spiders varies from very light, almost transparent, through almost all shades of yellow, green, red, orange, and to almost black, with spotting of various degrees on the lighter colored speci - mens. It has been suggested by some authors that the percentage of red individuals increases in the fall and that that is a hibernating type. The spots are caused largely by food in the digestive tract. The common red spider is an imported species, having undoubtedly been brought into America quite early from Europe. Since that time it has spread until now it is to be found generally over the United States and well into the southern provinces of Canada. It is also pretty widely distributed over the entire world. The red spiders are small and quite delicate, but can move quite rapidly and cover considerable distance in migrations from plant to plant. They also pass from tree to tree where the trees are so close together that their limbs interlace. It is questionable, though, whether these are important means of dispersal. Probably the most common </seg>
            <seg id="p572">REPOUT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE means of long distance dispersal is on the feet and legs of migrating perching birds. The spiders will readily crawl onto the feet of a bird that has alighted in an infested tree. The bird may almost immedi - ately take flight and fly for hundreds of miles before alighting and allowing the spiders to find a new host. The very extensive host range makes it possible for the establishment of such spiders on almost any plant upon which they find themselves. Wind and air currents are by no means negligible methods of transportation of such small animal life as the red spider. They may be whipped up off of the leaf surface and carried great distances in the upper air currents before they finally are dropped in some entirely new location. Spiders may be washed off of their host plants by torrential rains and carried for some distance to be left high and dry in a new situation, and while rains and regular washing with cold water are recommended for their control, the same procedure may aid in their dispersal. Commerce is also a serious, probably the most serious, source of spread of the spiders. I •'. ■ The spider winters in this state as adult hibernating spiders. These leave the annual and herbaceous perennial hosts in the fall and seek out protected places, cracks in the soil, brush piles, the under sides of stones, and so on, but especially on the trunks and larger branches of trees, under the loose bark and in cracks, and about the crown of the tree. They come out of hibernation during May or June and soon begin spinning the characteristic web. Within this, eggs are deposited, each female producing over fifty eggs. The eggs hatch in about three days and the spiders are adult in about ten days. Males are smaller than the females. The little spiders just hatched have only three pairs of legs, later producing the fourth pair. These are produced when the spider first sheds its skin. This is done as among insects, several times during the process of development. Previous to moulting the spider sticks the legs to the leaf surface by a short spun thread. Thus with the legs spread out and attached to the leaf surface the spider goes into a quiescent period, which lasts for several hours. It requires about fifteen days throughout the summer to complete a generation. When weather conditions are proper, it does not require much time for the spiders to become sufficiently abundant to do con - siderable damage. The common red spider feeds on a variety of host plants, or the eccentricities of the spider outbreaks may be due to different species. Normally the spider devoted much of its attention in Nebraska to the evergreens, and if any plants are severely infested it will show up on these ornamental trees first. During the summer of 1935 numerous reports came to our office of red spider infestation on many deciduous plants and trees, but the evergreens were relatively uninfested. Host plants include evergreens, especially the cedars and spruces, deciduous </seg>
            <seg id="p573">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY trees of all kinds, including both orchard varieties and ornamentals, fruit, shade and nut trees, shrubs, perennials and annuals, vegetables, and common weeds. They seem to prefer the more pubescent type of leaf, such as apple, phlox and bean among widely divergent types of plants. Without further discussion of the particular identity and food habits of the species, we may proceed with statements of control, for if the spider can be controlled in a certain way it really does not matter so much about its specific identity. The 'red spider seems to be quite easily killed by most insecticidal, arachnicidal or fungicidal applications to the plants. Even sprays of cold water applied regularly will reduce the numbers of red spiders materially. The principal materials that have been recommended for application as an arachnicide are sulphur, lime sulphur, lye sulphur, kerosene emulsion, glue, paste, and pure water sprays. Oils and alkaloid insecticides have been used but have not given as good results as some of the other materials which have been reported to kill as many as 99+ per cent of the spiders. It would seem, then, that there must be some other cause for the difficulties of its control. It has been suggested that during the period which the red spider is quiescent (preparatory to moulting) it is practically, immune to arachnicidal ap - plications. It might be most interesting to discuss spray applications for the control of the red spider in relation to the history of that practice, or chronologically. Certain very brief experiments were carried out in 1908 by Mr. H. M. Russell, on the control of red spiders in Florida. His experiments included, first, a spray of lime sulphur at the rate of 1 lb. of lime and 1 lb. of sulphur to 25 gallons of water. The plants sprayed were beans which seemed to be especially infested. The results after six days showed a 67 per cent kill as compared with check plants. In the second experiment a lye-sulphur spray was used, consisting of Vfe pound of lye and 1 pound of sulphur to 40 gallons of water. The re - sults were cheeked after two days and showed a 98.4 per cent kill. Then pure ground sulphur, 1 ounce to the gallon of water, was used and showed, after two days, a 91.7 per cent kill. His last experiment was with kerosene emulsion (1 part of stock emulsion to 10 of water). The following day he counted a 95 per cent kill of spiders. He made the statement that in a few days the rainy season set in and within a week there were no spiders to be found. His results show a per cent of effectiveness inversely proportional to the length of time after the spray application that the check was made. He stated that none of the materials used injured the plant foliage. The next important discovery was recorded by Mr. W. B. Parker in a Bureau of Entomology circular in which he reports the results of </seg>
            <seg id="p574">REPOUT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE tests of flour paste. This material was first recommended as a spreader for contact insecticides with which soap could not be used. It was used and proved satisfactory for that purpose, at the rate of 4 pounds of flour cooked into a paste, then diluted with 100 gallons of water or spray solution. Red spiders were found to be stuck to the leaf upon the drying of the paste, and a kill of 99.8 per cent to a perfect kill was recorded when the flour was used alone at twice that strength. This did not kill the eggs, and it was recommended that the application be repeated after about 10 days. In 1924, Mr. E. R. deOng published results of the preparation of colloidal sulphur and gave methods for the preparation of this especially actlve sulphur for spraying purposes. The finely divided particles it sulphur easily combined though, and he had some trouble from that cause. The colloidal sulphur was much finer than the commercial - ly ground sulphur and was much more active, killing spiders at lower temperatures. Glue or gelatin was used in the material to retain the colloidal properties. The plant extract "Derrisol", 1 part to 400 parts of water in com - bination with "Penetrol" at twice that strength, was recommended and gave good results. This combination has later been recommended with the "Penetrol" reduced to 1-200. In 1931, Alexander and Young recommended a commercial colloidal sulphur, stating that 2 pounds to 100 gallons of water gave excellent commercial control. At slightly greater strengths, a 100 per cent kill resulted, but it injured the plant foliage slightly. This was on greenhouse plants. The latest arachnicidal application which has been recommended and approved is one of dormant oils to kill the overwintering egg (of some spiders) and mites, but with a pink or calyx spray of lime sulphur, which single application proved to keep the pest in check for the remainder of the season in Washington. Mr. Hutson (1933) did work with reference to the control of red spiders on cane fruits that is almost a summary of all work previously done. His sprays included glue, oil, nicotine, pyrethrum, derris, and soap, and combinations of these materials. All sprays killed from 50 to 70 per cent of the spiders present with a single application, but after 7 to 10 days little or no difference could be noted between the mite population on the sprayed and the check plots. This again shows apparent results with a single spray soon after application with a loss of effectiveness within a few days. This cannot be entirely accounted for in the migration of the mites from plant to plant to equalize the infestation, nor can it be accounted for in a greater rate of increase among the mites left on the sprayed plants. It must be due to some </seg>
            <seg id="p575">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY factor not thoroughly revealed so far in the studies of the mite biology. Mr. Hutson further states that when spraying was done three times at 5-day intervals, all of the materials and combinations, except pyrethrum, were efficient sprays. Summer spray oils at 1 per cent strength proved quite satisfactory. Summarizing all of the evidence accumulated on chemical applica - tions for the control of the red spider, and reports of checks on the experimental procedure, it appears probable that the problem is one of time and method of application of the material rather than one of specific materials used, since practically all of the materials from pure water to oil sprays proved effective. This leaves an open field for research, which will be made more difficult by the eccentricities of the spiders, such as peculiarities in the developmental stages, diversity of types, multiplicity of food plants, and so on. Control can be accomplished by two or three applications of any of the arachnicides named above, timed at about 5-day intervals. Glue and flour paste seem to be as effective as lime sulphur, colloidal sul - phur, or oil sprays, and where these are not needed for their fungicidal value, or against sucking insects, may well replace them. The possi - bility of damage from these materials alone or in combination is slight. It is not desirable to follow lime sulphur with oil until it is fairly sure that the sulphur has been completely washed off of the trees. If oil is to be used for the control of sucking insects later in the season, one spraying with paste or glue in the first cover spray might prove advantageous. Since the red spider winters in hibernation as an adult, clean cul - ture to remove protection is advisable. This recommendation is in line with that for the control of the codling moth. The same clean - up practices will serve for both. If there is a limited coverage for the protection of the spiders, many of them will go under bands placed on the trees for the codling moth larvae. If these have been treated, red spiders will be killed in large numbers. It is very unfortunate that work has been done and publication made of the use of Selenium as a substitute material for sulphur in the red spider spray. It is unfortunate, for someone may see this work and decide to try the treatment. Selenium in very small quantities in the soil is taken up by the plants and forms toxic compounds which prove fatal to experimental animals within a few weeks. In slightly greater quantities it stunts and finally stops plant growth. </seg>

Was the species of spider found on the apples and raspberries the same as was on the elm? A I don't know but I presume it was the same. q'. When the spider turns red, is it in the adult stage or due to </seg>
            <seg id="p577">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY climatic conditions? A. I think due to seasonable conditions. STATEMENT: On some trees I examined, I found green ones on the trunk but red ones gathered at the base of the tree. MR. ROBERTS: I presume this cluster at the base of the tree is a wintering or late season stage. Q. Would you recommend an oil spray for evergreens? A. It has been used but probably not so strong. MR. WILLIAMS: We find soil conditions make a difference. If there is plenty of moisture, there seemed to be no damage from oil but, if the trees were dry, we had burning. I thought they absorbed too much oil residue in an effort to get moisture. We also found that the addition of fish oil soap made it more effective. Q. Will ordinary soap do the same? A. Well, fish oil soap is cheap and that is why it is used but other soap would probably work just the same. Q. What about adding nicotine to the oil spray? A. The addition of Nicotine Sulphate would not have enough additional advantage to equal the extra cost. In cities, where you have water under pressure, just washing the trees every few days is a very effective measure of control of red spider. Q. Since they are a hot weather insect, would colder water be more effective? A. It would be difficult to get very cold water to the trees. By the time it was broken up into a fine mist, it would be the temperature of the atmosphere. Q. Could lead arsenate be used with lime sulphur and destroy the codling moth at the same time? A. Yes, they could be used together. Q. If the red spider is a crawling insect and goes down to the base of the tree in winter, why couldn't we control it by banding? A. That is one method that is recommended to a certain extent. Bands put on primarily for codling moth were effective in destroying spiders as well.

            <seg id="p578">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE believe it destroys some spiders. Q. Since experiments show that glue spray, ordinary bone glue dissolved in warm water, is 98% effective why not use just that? A. The only benefit from that would be to stick the spiders down and thus destroy them. It would mean spraying oftener for the eggs are not destroyed and it would be necessary to spray every two or three weeks to destroy the spiders hatched after each spray. Q. What is your opinion of sulphur dust? We have used it on evergreens very successfully. A. The chief difficulty would be to get the dust to the spiders through the web. A spray using 300 pounds pressure will destroy the webs so that the spray can reach the spiders. MR. MARSHALL: Does sulphur put on in a liquid form do more injury than used dry? MR. HOPPERT: Yes, if the humidity is high, you are likely to get burning. Liquid lime sulphur is one of the most effective ma - terials for red spider control but it is dangerous to use in hot weather when the spider is most likely to be serious. The wettable sulphurs are efficient for control of red spider and are much less likely to injure the foliage. MR. ROBERTS: The chairman says I have about ten minutes left so I would like to give you a few things in the way of control practices of the flat headed borer. I discussed this topic in considerable de - tail at the Tuesday session and if you are interested in this matter it might pay you to review this discussion. I'll take time now only for the high spots and then answer your questions, if you have any. Briefly the life history of flat headed borer is this: The adult is a brownish beetle about a quarter inch in length. I have here a mount showing the adult and several larvae of different ages. I'll pass these out so you can study them. The female beetle lays eggs usually on the sunny side of trees on larger branches and on the trunk. The eggs hatch into flat headed yellowish grubs that bore into the cambium and feed there until they become about an inch long. Then they burrow into the heart wood of the tree and hibernate. In early spring they pupate and change to beetles. Emergence begins about the middle of May and may extend to the middle of August. There is little likelihood of your being able to control this fellow </seg>
            <seg id="p579">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY by working on the beetle, of course it is good practice to remove ana burn dead trees and dead limbs on live trees. That will reduce the numbers somewhat. This insect lives in various forest trees also and in shade trees so there is always a chance of borers getting into the orchard. You needn't worry about borers getting into vigorous trees. The eggs that are laid on such trees may hatch but the borers are drowned when they try to get into the cambium. It is the weak trees and the newly transplanted trees that are most susceptible. These need to be treated in such a way as to make them vigorous if possible and then they need to be protected from having eggs laid upon them. Repellent washes are recommended in Michigan. I have a circular giv - ing directions for this wash which you can have. Wrappings are very effective particularly if the borers are kept away from the tree. Many of you have fertilizer sacks. They can be cut into strips and tied securely around the young trees. Q. Why not use old tar paper as a wrapping? MR. ROBERTS: The difficulty is that the trunk of the tree is quite irregular and tar paper has no give so you could not get a tight wrapping. STATEMENT: I have had a bad time with borers on my young trees Now, they are going to some of the larger trees. A. Conditions due to drouth have brought on this borer epidemic and once we get normal rainfall again and the trees have an oppor - tunity to get into normal condition, we will not have so much borer injury. Mr. Bare thinks this may last for ten years but I am more optimistic. I believe it will work out in two or three years. • Q. By the time you see a place where borers are working, is it too late to do anything about it? A. They may be dug out by mechanical means or a wash applied. Q. During rapid growing period, is it dangerous to apply this wash ? MR. ROBERTS: The wash is harmless to the bark of the tree but it would injure the leaves. MR. WILLIAMS: What are you going to do this year with your trees, Mr. Hoppert? MR. HOPPERT: Those that were injured badly last year might as well be taken out. The others will take care of themselves.

THE RED SPIDER ON APPLES By HOWARD BAKER, Associate Entomologist, Division of Fruit Insect Investigations, Bureau of Entomology and Plant Quarantine, U. S. Department of Agriculture During the last two years mites, commonly called red spiders, have been present in large numbers and have caused serious damage in a number of apple orchards in northeastern Kansas and northwestern Missouri. In many instances the mite infestations have developed to serious proportions and have caused much, damage before they have been noticed. The appearance of the mites in such enormous numbers and the serious injury they have caused, together with the fact that the recommended control measures have not in all cases given the degree of control expected, has been responsible for the develop - ment of a considerable feeling of apprehension in the minds of many growers concerning the future importance of these mites. The efforts of the St. Joseph, Mo., field laboratory of the Bureau of Entomology and Plant Quarantine have been devoted almost exclusively to the problem of codling moth control, and it has not been possible to give much attention to the red spider. I will, however, present information on this pest, gleaned from publications on the subject, together with the observations we have been able to make from time to time. There are several species of mites that may infest apple and other fruit trees, but the one responsible for the serious damage in this sec - tion during the past season is without doubt the common red spider, </seg>
            <seg id="p583">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY known to entomologists as Tetrnnychus telnrius L. This mite is widely distributed throughout the United States, but usually occurs most abundantly in dry or semiarid regions or in seasons of drought. It has been reported as attacking a wide variety of plants, including both wild and cultivated flowers, truck crops, vines, bushes, shrubs, and trees. Fruit trees, especially the apple ,pear, and plum, are among the most favored hosts. The mites feed by inserting their beaks into the leaf tissues and withdrawing the contents of the leaf cells, including the chlorophyll. Affected leaves become mottled in appearance, turn brown or bronzed, and may dry up and drop. The red spider ordinarily feeds on the underside of the leaves, but when abundant may be found in large numbers on the upper side as well. As the infestation develops, a fine web is spun over much of the underside of infested leaves, apparently serving largely as a protection to the mites. The damage resulting from a red spider attack, especially if it is light to moderate, is often difficult to measure. In cases of severe or heavy infestation the damage may be measured directly in impair - ment of the ability of infested leaves to function properly; in heavy to almost complete defoliation, which may result in forcing out a late growth of new foliage; in weakening the tree; in loss of crop through dropping or failure of the fruit to size and color normally; and in almost certain failure of the tree to set much, if any, crop the following year. In the Missouri River Valley certain apple varieties have suffered more injury from red spider attacks than others. Of the commonly grown varieties, those most often seriously injured have been Wine - sap, Delicious, York, and Missouri Pippin, while the one least injured has been Ben Davis. Varieties such as Jonathan, Grimes, Stayman, and Black Twig have suffered an intermediate amount of injury. No one variety has been the one most severely injured in every in - fested orchard. Winesap may suffer most in one orchard, York in another, Delicious in another, and so on. The full grown female mite is not over about one-fiftieth of an inch in length, while the male is considerably smaller. The feeding mites vary considerably in color, but are most commonly greenish to yellow or straw-colored, while the hibernating forms are usually orange or rust colored. In this region under outdoor conditions the red spider passes the winter in hibernation in the adult stage. It may be found in every conceivable situation' on or about an apple tree. Apparently only the females go into hiberation for, out of several thousand specimens </seg>
            <seg id="p584">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE forwarded to Washington for determination of species, no males were found. Similar observations have been made elsewhere. In the spring the surviving mites migrate into the trees, first attack - ing the foliage on the inside of the tree nearest the ground and later ex - tending their operations to the whole tree. The first eggs appear to be laid about the time the foliage is well developed. \ As with many other insects, the number of eggs laid, the length of time required for them to hatch, the period required for the de - velopment of a generation, and the number of generations a season depend upon weather and food conditions. It is probable that there may be about six or seven generations a year in the Missouri River region. Many workers have observed and reported that the most rapid multiplication of this species occurs during periods of high temperature and low rainfall, and that cool, rainy weather is deterimental to the pest. It appears probable, however, that enough red spiders are present in most orchards most of the time to result in a serious out - break whenever conditions become favorable. In the recent situation in this section, it is quite evident that the mite population was so great following the hot, dry summer of 1934 that unusually cool and wet weather during April, May, and June of 1935 could not prevent a serious infestation from developing during July and the early part of August, when temperatures were sufficiently high and rainfall suf - ficiently low again to favor the pest. It has been demonstrated that the red spider can spread by crawling, and can be dispersed by wind, rain, birds, on the clothing of workmen, etc. It has been reported that a red spider will stand sub - mergence in water for considerable periods, and that heavy rains which beat many of the mites to the ground result in their being carried long distances, where some are able to revive and start new infestations. As an indication of the possibility of dispersal by wind, large numbers of mites have been captured on sticky surfaces placed as high as 5 0 feet in the air, and as far as 650 feet from infested orchards. The most promising time to attempt control of the red spider is -during the growing season after it has left its hibernation quarters, but before it has built up its population to outbreak proportions. Outbreaks usually occur during July or early in August. Control should be attempted, therefore, during May and June, and perhaps early in July, and should be aimed at preventing a severe infestation rather than reducing one after it has developed. The application of sulphur dust, sulphur sprays, and oil sprays are the measures usually recommended for controlling the red spider -on fruit trees. In the Pacific Northwest it has been reported that </seg>
            <seg id="p585">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY sulphur dust controlled this mite very well In a single test, that sum - mer strength lime-sulphur killed most of the mites but very few eggs, and that oil sprays gave very good results, killing practically 100 per cent of the mites and most of the summer eggs. In this section, a more careful application of the sulphur sprays applied for scab control, particular attention being paid to covering the lower, inside portions of the tree and the undersides of the leaves, should aid materially in retarding and reducing early-season red spider development. After the danger of scab infection is over and it is safe to apply oil sprays (at least 2 to 3 weeks after sulphur has been used), the application of one to three sprays of a summer-oil emulsion at from 0.75 to 1.00 per cent actual oil should result in holding red spider infestation to a minimum. These sprays may well be combined with the regular first-brood codling moth cover sprays of lead arsenate. The use of oil with lead arsenate in the first-brood cover sprays should not seriously complicate the problem of spray residue, if the grower is equipped with effective machinery for residue removal. Attempts to control red spider infestations once they have reached outbreak proportions have not been altogether satisfactory in the experience of most growers. In this section, outbreaks usually occur during periods of high temperature in July or early in August. Oil applied at this time is certain to complicate the spray residue situation, but, if the infestation is to be combatted, the application of a summer - oil spray containing from 0.75 to 1.00 per cent actual oil is the most suitable measure now known, both as to effectiveness and safety to fruit and foliage. Sulphur sprays applied under the conditions usually existing at this time are likely to cause injury to both fruit and foliage, and are not so effective as oil. Dormant-type oil emulsions should not be used under any circumstances, for they are little, if any, more effective than suitable summer-oil emulsions and are much more likely to injure fruit and foliage. It is almost impossible to secure complete control of a severe in - festation with one application of spray, but the thorough application of a suitable oil spray will so reduce the mite population that severe injury may be avoided. Examination of foliage collected from heavily infested trees which had been thoroughly sprayed with a summer-type oil emulsion showed that about 80 per cent of the mites remaining on the foliage were killed. This probably represents the minimum degree of control obtained, for, unquestionably, large numbers of the mites were knocked from the trees when the spray was applied. Examina - tion of leaves from this same block one week after the spray -was applied showed that there remained an average of slightly less than 1 mite per leaf, that there was an average of 5 to 6 mites per leaf on a </seg>
            <seg id="p586">REPORT OI" NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF ACRICUI.TUKE few trees sprayed somewhat differently and on which 58 per cent control was obtained, and that leaves on unsprayed trees in another section of the orchard were swarming with mites and suffering severe injury. Since this species hibernates in every conceivable situation on or about an apple tree, it is unlikely that the application of dormant control measures could give effective control, although the number of hibernating red spiders might be reduced considerably. However, cer - tain measures commonly used during the dormant season for combatt - ing other insects when they are present would help to reduce the number of hiberating mites. Such measures would include (a) apply - ing a dormant-oil spray such as is used for control of the San Jose scale, (b) scraping off and burning all loose bark, as is done to prepare trees for banding for the codling moth, and (c) cleaning up and burning leaves and trash, as is done for the apple curculio. It is very doubtful that it would pay to apply any of these measures especially for the red spider. There is much concerning the development and movements of the red spider in the recent outbreak that we do not understand. Some orchards were severely infested while others were not, though the former were apparently just as well or perhaps better cared for. Some orchards developed an infestation on a few trees which did not spread, while in other orchards an infestation starting in the same way spread out to damage a considerable acreage, or perhaps the whole orchard. Some orchards receiving a maximum number of sulphur sprays for scab suffered as great or greater injury than others receiving a mini - mum number of sulphur sprays. Some orchards in which oil sprays were applied in the regular cover sprays for the codling moth suffered severe injury, while others suffered little or none. Some of the differ - ences observed between orchards and mentioned in the forgoing observa - tions might be explained by (a) variations in the degree of the original infestation, (b) variations in the abundance of predators and parasites, (c) variations in the timing of the regular sprays in relation to mite development, and (d) wide variations in the thoroughness of spray applications. Only a detailed study of the red spider continued over a period of several years could furnish . the evidence upon which to attempt a more complete and satisfactory explanation of the differ - ences noted between orchards. No attempt will be made to predict what the red spider will do in Missouri Valley orchards next year and the years following. The species has been present, however, for many years, and outbreaks have occurred only occasionally, after which there have usually been periods of years in which little or no damage has been evident. One encouraging factor has recently been observed. Examinations </seg>
            <seg id="p587">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY of hibernating mites at intervals throughout the past few months have revealed the fact that a disease is reducing their number far more effectively than any remedy that could be applied during the dormant period. This disease, as yet unidentified, was first observed attacking the mites which sought hibernating quarters in cracks and crevices in the ground. Later it was found attacking mites in damp situations and, more recently, it has been found attacking them quite generally in all situations. It remains to be seen what effect this reduction by disease will have on the abundance of the red spider next year. SOIL MOISTURE AND ITS RELATION TO ORCHARDING C. C. WIGGANS Horticulture Department, U. of N. There is an old saying "You never miss the water until the well runs dry." We all have realized that the past several seasons have been drier than usual but until we began to see our trees wilt and then had to harvest the small sized fruit, we gave little thought to the problem as to where or how the tree can secure enough water to survive such conditions. In Nebraska perhaps a keener appreciation of what probably was happening in our orchards developed a few years ago when the first report of agronomical investigations of the subsoil moisture situation in an alfalfa planting was made available. Very clearly it was shown that a planting of alfalfa on yirgin soil produced well for a few years, regardless of seasonal rainfall, but then the production declined and became directly proportional to annual precipitation. Tests showed that the roots penetrated to depths of 25 feet or more and that the soil was dried out to the same depth. A second fact which stimulated our thinking further was a knowl - edge of how far and how fast an apple tree root can develop. In an investigation dealing with ne,wly set Delicious trees, the entire root system of several trees under various types of soil management were dug at the end of the first growing season. Others were dug after the second season and still others after the third. To our very great surprise these roots were found to have penetrated in three seasons to a depth of 16 feet or more and to have a spread of perhaps 20 feet. Although the trees tops were not much higher than one's head, there had been a tremendous development under ground. Following this as a lead during the summer of 1934 an effort was made to determine the extent and density of the root system of a 17 year old Jonathan tree. These trees were spaced 30x33 feet. One </seg>
            <seg id="p588">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF Ar.RICL'LTl'RE quarter of this area was dug out, by three foot sections, and root counts made at varying distances from the tree and at various depths. Digging continued downward as long as roots were found. When the job was completed we had a hole 15x16 1&amp; feet and 30 feet deep. Further depth penetration had been prevented by an impenetrable shale layer. Roots were found all through this area. Even with such limitations each tree was drawing upon a volume 30x33x30 feet for moisture and food supply — a total volume of approximately 1000 wagon loads. Whether roots might have gone deeper provided suitable soil conditions had been present is merely conjecture but there seems little reason to believe that they would not have done so. With these facts in hand, the next question to be answered was, what effect is such widespread deep rooting having on the moisture content of the soil. Obviously the only reason for the observed rooting habit must be an effort to supply the moisture needs of the tree since there would be little or no need or possibility for minerals or nitrogen to be brought up from such depths. Consequently soil samples were collected from various points and from varying distances from trees of different ages and varieties. Such samples were secured by using a standard steel soil sampling tube. This was driven into the soil, i lifted with a pump jack, the soil core removed, and divided into one foot sections, which were preserved in tight containers. Such samples were taken to the laboratory, weighed, dried and then weighed again. Weight loss was used to measure the water content. This was then calculated as a percentage of the dry soil weight. Thus we were able to determine the soil moisture content of various portions of the root zone. When considering soil moisture one must always bear in mind that not all the water content of the soil is available for plant use. A plant will die from water starvation even though a considerable per - centage of water remains in the soil. This unavailable water is called by various terms such as wetting percentage, hygroscopic coeficient, etc. and the amount depends upon soil texture or soil particle size. The finer the soil particles are the more water they will hold against the pull of plant roots. In this discussion the term hygroscopic co - efficient is used. The soil in the area when this work has been done is classed as "loess" — the same sort as is found in the hills along the Missouri and Mississippi rivers. Under normal conditions the water holding' capacity of this soil is around 25%. If more water is added after this point is reached what is already present Is simply pushed down deeper or else the additional water gets away as runoff without ever really entering the soil. The hygroscopic figure varies from about 10 to 12%. Thus it will be seen that the available soil moisture is ap- </seg>
            <seg id="p589">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY proximately 15%. In loess soil available water averages 2 — 2M inches of water per foot of depth. These figures represent the reserve which should be in the soil at the time the orchard is planted. Without this reserve orcharding, or indeed any crop production would be a hazardous undertaking unless one were assured of a supplemental supply. The first soil samples were taken at the University Fruit Farm — our experimental planting located near Union, Nebraska. The results of the first determinations were startling to say the least. These trees were 17 years old and planted 43 trees (30x33 ft.) per acre in one part of the orchard and twice that thick where fillers had been used. In the latter case the trees are about 22.3 feet apart. In the filler black samples were taken as near the tree as possible and in the middle of the intersection approximately 15 feet from the tree, while in the permanent block, the sampling stations were located at the tree, midway between trees (15 feet from the tree) and in the middle of the intersection (22.3 feet from the tree). From the moisture percentages obtained through these determina - tions was then subtracted the hygroscopic coefficient percentage. Disregarding the figures for the upper five feet, the moisture content of which must be considered transitional — that is subject to replenish - ment by rains or removal by shallow rooted crops annually — it was found that approximately 85% of all available water had already been used in the filler block and about 65% in comparable location (15 feet from the tree) in the permanent block. In other words these thickly planted trees, "8 6 per acre, had in seventeen years used 60-70 acre inches more water than they had secured from seasonal rainfall by withdrawing this quantity from the upper 30 or 35 feet of the soil. From now on these trees must depend almost entirely upon seasonal rainfall since there is no other water available for them. The soil in the filler block is dry all the way down while in the permanent area conditions are not quite so bad. There is little question, how - ever, but that even 43 trees per acre make a severe drain upon soil moisture. Perhaps right here lies the explanation for why apple trees in our territory do not live as long as the same varieties in other more humid regions. This explains, I believe, why we have few 40-50 year old orchards in Nebraska — most of them are 15-20 and as yet have not used up all the reserve moisture. Our first orchard crop came, grew, used up all the water and passed on perhaps during a drouth period. The third or fourth orchard crop is now growing in Ne - braska and perhaps also in northeast Kansas and northeastern Missouri. With these results as a starter samples were taken in other or - chards of different ages and spacings. From a 30 year old orchard near Shubert some 65% of the available water had been used while in an </seg>
            <seg id="p590">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE adjoining 7 year old planting only 5 % had been lost from a comparable location. A very interesting thing was brought out in a sample from another 7 year old planting belonging to the same owner. In this case the orchard had been planted on an area which had already produced one crop of apple trees. Ben Davis trees set in 1890 had been removed in 1922. The soil had been used to produce ordinary farm crops until 1928 when it was again set to apples. In this area 30 % of the available water was gone in comparison with 5% from the virgin planting. This surely indicates the folly of trying to introduce replants to fill vacancies in an old orchard and also of trying to plant another orchard on ground where one has been produced unless there is a longer interval than 7 years. In another orchard near Shubert 80% of available moisture below 5 feet had been used in 17 years and only about 5% in 6 years in an ad - joining planting. In this particular location there had been no influ - ence on the moisture content below the 20 foot level — due undoubt - edly to the presence of a soil layer into which or through which the roots could not go. As in the previous case this indicates that for the first few years the tree's demands have little effect on the total available water supply. However, samples taken near the tree do show that depletion has begun and as time goes on the drain becomes heavier and heavier. From the facts given above one begins to wonder whether the explanation given for the decline of the earlier plantings is a valid one. Diseases are usually mentioned but it seems very probable that moisture deficiency may also have been a very potent factor. A tree weakened by lack of water will more quickly succumb to the ravages of canker, etc. Where the soil layer available for water storage is only 18-20 feet thick, naturally orchards cannot be expected to last as long as where 40 feet or even more of soil is available for root use. In 1935 the work was continued mainly on the University Fruit Farm. Results showed that the driest area, considering all depths, is near the tree — the wettest the farthest away. Apparently then a tree begins to draw on subsoil moisture' at any time after planting when surface water is short. Depletion occurring at this time becomes progressively worse as the tree ages and extends both downward and laterally. In the permanent planting the relative usage of water at 1.5 feet, 15 feet and 22.3 feet from the tree were 47, 36 and 25%. These figures are based on averages of about 25 samples and probably give a better picture of the actual situation than the figures given for the first sampling. In a nearby 19 year orchard samples were taken at the tree and from the intersection. At the tree approximately 60% of the available water had already been used and about 35% at the intersection. When </seg>
            <seg id="p591">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY single samples from Grimes and Blacktwig trees are compared the Grimes area has already given up 80% of Its available water and the Blacktwig about 35%. This indicates that possibly varieties may have different water requirements which in turn may explain why some varieties are shorter lived than others. Figures for the Jonathan are close to those of the Grimes and those for the Winesap are com - parable to those of the Blacktwig. The next question which comes up is what can be done about all this? Can depletion be prevented or if it occurs can a depleted supply be built up by proper management? We believe that there are soms very definite things which can be done. In the first place never plant an orchard where one matured and then died or on an alfalfa site, unless you are sure ample time has intervened to allow for moisture replenishment. In the next place forget all about compass direction and plant rows on the contour. Contour farming does check runoff — in fact a little care from the orchardist may prevent it almost entirely in his planting. If all the rainfall can be gotten into the ground there probably is enough to grow good trees for a long time. However, if our rainfall is 30 inches or less and, as has been estimated, 1/3 is lost by runoff and another 1/3 by evaporation other than through the trees, the remainder is just not enough to support the tree properly. As a final step don^t plant too many trees per acre. Unquestionably fillers, in a region where rainfall is deficient, do lessen the life span of the orchard. If a certain number of trees must be used they should be scattered over more territory. That some of the above suggestions are practical ones can be in - dicated by some further results obtained during the past season. Near Union is an area from which an old orchard was removed several years ago. Today that soil is just as wet down to a depth of 20 feet as is soil which has never grown trees. Below that level it is still dry. In Arbor Lodge State Park at .Nebraska City is a white pine grove set in 1890. In 1934 many trees, particularly in the center of the area, died either from lack of water or extreme heat or both. In December, soil samples showed that between 5 and 25 feet there was very little available moisture. A year later moisture had been replenished to a depth of approximately 14 feet. In the meantime runoff and evapora - tion had been prevented by the needle cover and there had been little or no demand by plants for soil water because of the death of most of the trees. Undoubtedly in soils where water penetration occurs much more slowly, such as those found even within forty miles of the Mis - souri river, this replenishment process will proceed at a greatly re - duced rate. In such areas the Interim between orchard crops or in fact </seg>
            <seg id="p592">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE any other deep rooted perennial will necessarily have to be considerably greater than in the River Hill area. • On the University Fruit Farm is a vineyard now some 12 or 14. years old. A portion of this vineyard has been mulched with straw for ten years or long while some nearby rows have been kept under clean cultivation. Soil samples taken at various times between De - cember 1934 and December 1935 show that in the mulched area there is npw as much or more soil moisture than in an adjoining field where only annual crops have been produced. On the other hand something like 50% of all available water below 5 feet has been used in the cultivated portion. Apparently, therefore, the mulch by preventing all runoff and surface evaporation has been able to so conserve rain - fall that the needs of the plant have been supplied without depletion of the subsoil moisture supply. While mulching has its drawbacks and in some cases may even be out of the question for orchards this test at least gives a suggestion as to one solution. Still another possibility may lie in the use of the basin lister. An attachment placed behind an ordinary lister makes dams across the lister furrow at specified intervals. Some orchardists are already using this contrivance with the idea of preventing runoff by holding the rainfall in these small basins until it soaks into the ground. Its use also presents some practical difficulties so far as other orchard operations are concerned but even so it should not be dismissed too lightly. Something of this sort may be the way out of the difficulties of the hill orchard men who cannot now contour their planting or cover it with straw. We, in Nebraska, appreciate the fact that we are at an extreme point in the orchard business so far as precipitation is concerned. South and east of us there is heavier rainfall but even so perhaps many Kansas and Missouri and Iowa and Illinois orchards are suffering too. Some of our oldest and most productive orchards are located on second bottom where undoubtedly they receive some runoff and probably also send roots down to the water table. Just what soil samples from this territory will show is a matter of conjecture since none have been taken there as yet. My guess is that these trees are still well supplied with water or they would not be so large or so productive. Still another interesting observation was made in connection with the root study mentioned in the beginning. In the fall of 1934, when things were very dry, the active root tips were very deep. Last spring (1935) after the upper several feet had been filled up again with water, the active tips were in this region. Consequently, it seems only reasonable to believe that the deeper roots draw actively on sub - soil water only when it is not available to those near the surface. If all or most of the surface water can be saved for the use of the tree </seg>
            <seg id="p593">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY there seems little reason to believe that it will be Insufficient. As a final suggestion to the apple growers on the River Hills through this territory, may I say that I believe you should use every means at your command to save surface water for tree use and it may even pay to pump water from creeks or ponds back on to the orchard site where or when such supplemental water is available. UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Bureau of Plant Industry THE ORCHARD SOIL MOISTURE PROBLEM IN THE MISSOURI VALLEY By J. R. MAGNESS, Principal Pomologist, Division of Fruit and Vegetable, Crops and Diseases Beltsville, Maryland I am very glad to be here this afternoon and to follow Prof. Wiggans' excellent discussion on soil moisture. He has given you some basic information on Just what the orchard soil moisture situation is in this particular territory. He has pointed out the fact that any soil will take up and hold against gravity only a certain amount of water, the amount varying with the nature of the soil. He has also shown that a portion of this water that may be taken up by the soil is un - available for plant usage. He has shown that under the manage - ment practices that have been used, the reserve of moisture in the soil in this territory is gradually used up by mature orchards and that as the trees have become older the reserve moisture available for their use has gradually become less. In this particular territory along the Missouri River you are more fortunate than most fruit growers in the United States in having a soil that will store a tremendous amount of water. Prof. Wiggans has made an estimate that in these loess soils you may have stored when you plant an orchard as much as 60 or 70 inches of water that will ultimately be available to the trees. That is a tremendous reserve as compared with what we have in most orchards in the United States. Few orchard sections have a soil as deep and as retentive of moisture as you have here. Many orchard soils are not over 2 or 3 feet deep in - stead of 30. If you have an orchard on shallow soil, and there are some such in the states represented here this afternoon, then a large water storage reserve is not available and your orchard is dependent upon get - ting rainfall at close intervals during the growing season if your crop of fruit is to develop satisfactorily. On such deep soils as are used for </seg>
            <seg id="p594">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE orcnarding in this section, however, it is possible to have sufficient water in the soil in the spring to carry the trees through the summer in fairly good shape even though no additional rainfall occurs. As Prof. Wiggans has pointed out, however, as the orchards have been handled the great reserve of moisture available when they were planted has gradually disappeared so that at least in some cases by the time the trees are 30 years of age this moisture reserve has become prac - tically exhausted. From that time on, therefore, the trees are de - pendent primarily on the amount of rainfall that they get each grow - ing season, and this is too irregular and uncertain to carry them satisfactorily. Behavior or the Tree under Reduced Moisture Supply When the whole root zone of the tree has moisture available, the trees are in the optimum condition from the standpoint of moisture supply. As more and more of the root zone is reduced to the wilting percentage (the point below which the trees cannot absorb water) the amount of water available for the tree or the rate the water can be supplied to the roots is gradually reduced. What is the effect of this reduced rate of moisture supply on tree functioning? To discuss this point it is necessary to review the question of just how food materials are formed in the trees. As most of you know, the food from which the fruit is manufactured is built primarily in the leaves. In the leaves of the tree we have water from the soil coming into contact with carbon dioxide which is present in small quantities in the air. In the presence of the green coloring matter in the leaves and with the energy of sunlight, this carbon dioxide and water are combined to form simple sugars. From these sugars are built most of the tissues that make up the tree and the fruit. Leaves of an apple tree are complex structures. On the under sides of the leaves we have literally thousands of small pores, termed stomata by the botanists. These pores have the power of opening and closing. They normally close at night and open when sunlight strikes the leaves in the morning. They remain open, in the case of apple trees, until a certain deficiency of moisture develops in the leaves, at which time they close and are likely to remain closed throughout the rest of the day. Water vapor is given off from the leaf to a considerable extent through these pores, and the carbon dioxide from the air also enters . the leaf largely through them. When these pores are open we there - fore apparently have a maximum possibility for the entrance of carbon dioxide and the building of sugars. With uniform conditions of temperature and humidity, the num - ber of hours per day that these pores stand open is closely correlated with the amount of the root zone that has moisture available. It is </seg>
            <seg id="p595">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY also correjated with the temperature and relative humidity of the air. With a given soil moisture condition these pores remain open a shorter time on very hot, dry days than on cooler and more humid days. On fairly open soil, apples apparently do not suffer measurably for water as long as most of the root zone is above the wilting per - centage of the soil, in other words, as long as there is some available moisture throughout the root zone. As a portion of the root zone becomes dried down to the wilting percentage, the water supply to the tree is reduced and fruit growth rate is reduced. As more and more of the root zone becomes so dry that the roots can not absorb water, the condition is finally reached that stomata fall to open, the leaves wilt, and fruit growth ceases. Normally, with ample soil moisture, the growth rate of apples is nearly uniform during the period from about 6 weeks after full bloom until harvest. If there is ample moisture and foliage is healthy, winter apples during this period will grow about 1 per cent of their final size per day. If during this period, however, there are times when the growth rate of the fruit is reduced because of moisture shortage, the final size of the fruit will be reduced accordingly. Drought con - ditions apparently do not greatly affect the season of maturity of the fruit, but they do affect very materially the size, color, and quality of the fruit. When water is restored after a period of shortage, for example as a result of rains or irrigation, it is remarkable how quickly the growth rate of the fruit will be restored. If the trees have not suffered to the extent that the leaves have dropped, then when moisture is re - stored the growth rate of the fruit will be practically as rapid as though no deficiency had occurred. However, the reduced growth rate for a period during the growing season will result in a corresponding reduced size at harvest time. The final size of the fruit will be de - creased in proportion to the length of time and the severity of water shortage. If there is a water shortage at the end of the growing season or when the fruit is maturing on the tree, the color of the fruit will be dull and lifeless instead of the bright red that is so desirable. So far as fruit-bud formation is concerned, the evidence would indicate that water shortage does not prevent fruit-bud formation. In fact if water shortage occurs early in the season when fruit-bud formation can be influenced readily, it tends to increase fruit-bud formation rather than decrease it. Consequently, following a drought which comes during the first half of the growing season, we usually have a heavy blossoming the following spring rather than a light one. </seg>
            <seg id="p596">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Under conditions of extreme drought, as we have indicated, the total food materials formed in the leaves are apparently distinctly less than under conditions of ample moisture supply. This results not only in decreased size of fruit but also in greater susceptibility of the trees to winter injury. Consequently there is much greater danger of loss of trees during very severe winters following such drought conditions than following seasons when the soil is amply supplied with moisture. Thus it is apparent that if the trees are to be vigorous and healthy and if fruit of good marketable size and quality is to be grown, ample available moisture' must be present in the orchard throughout the growing season. The Moisture Requirement of Fruit Trees ■ A very important question to consider from the standpoint of your orchard management program is how much water is required to carry - apple orchards through a year. This of course varies in different parts of the United States and with the summer temperatures and humidi - ties that prevail. The hotter and drier the territory the more water will be used by the tree to carry it through a season. Rather careful ■ experiments in different parts of the United States would indicate that mature orchards under the conditions prevailing in the Missouri Valley will use about 4 acre inches of water per month during the season when the leaf area is fully . expanded and somewhat less during the period that the foliage is developing. In this section we have about 5 months which would approach full usage of water and perhaps an additional month when the trees would be requiring some water. I believe we can safely assume that trees should have from 20 to 24 inches of water per growing season actually available to the trees in order to function at ' the optimum in this section. Weather Bureau records indicate that {the average annual rainfall in this section ranges from 30 to 35 inches! per year. While variations of course occur rang - ing all the way from 20 inches during dry years up to 40 inches in wet years, it is apparent that if all the water that falls could be con - served the orchards would usually have sufficient water to produce good fruit. It is apparent, however, that under actual conditions existing in this section a considerable amount of the rainfall is lost and never becomes available to the trees. Weather Bureau records also indicate that most of the rainfall in this section comes during the summer months with May, June, and July the heaviest rainfall season. A good deal of the rainfall comes in heavy showers. It is evident that this rainfall must be saved if the orchards are to remain productive. </seg>
            <seg id="p597">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY How Is Water Lost from the Orchard? There are 5 important sources of water loss in orchards. The first of these is deep penetration. This is probably of little importance under the conditions existing here. It occurs only after the soil is saturated with water, when additional water may percolate down beyond the reach of plant roots. This source of loss is important on shallow soils but not under conditions in this territory. The second source of loss is surface evaporation. Regardless of whether the soil is cultivated or maintained in sod, some water is lost by evaporation from the surface after each rainfall period. This loss is higher when most of the rainfall comes during the hot summer months, as in this territory. While it is impossible to entirely avoid this loss, certain treatments will minimize it, as will be mentioned later. The third source of water loss is surfuce run-off. With rolling orchard lands or orchards planted on rather steep slopes and with the rain coming at times in very heavy showers, the loss from surface run-off may be very great indeed. This loss must be prevented if sufficient water is to be stored in the soil, under conditions here, to grow orchards satis - factorily. I believe estimates indicate that in some cases as much as 50 per cent of the water that falls on these soils may be lost by surface run-off. A fourth source of loss of moisture is evaporation from weeds, .gross, or cover crops that may be growing in the orchard. All plants evaporate water from their surfaces. Therefore any cover crop ma - terial growing in the orchard will result in considerable water loss. This can be minimized by keeping grass sods and similar crops mowed during the growing season. The fifth great source of water loss is evaporation of the wuter from the loaves of the fruit trees themselves. This is the one source of water loss which we can not prevent and should not attempt to prevent. As indicated above, this will account for around 2 0 inches of water per season if the trees are growing normally. While this is the greatest individual source of water loss in the orchard, it is the one source of loss which we should not attempt to curtail. Handling Orchard Soils to Prevent Loss of Moisture Prof. Wiggans has discussed a number of orchard management prac - tices which will tend to conserve water. I wish to emphasize some of these treatments even more. Mulching — Where it is possible to mulch orchards heavily with vegetable matter hauled in from other parts of the farm, this rep - resents I believe the most ideal treatment from the standpoint of pre - venting water loss. Materials used may include wheat straw, corn fodder, and any other vegetable material that is available in sufficient Amounts to form a mat 4 or 5 inches deep under the trees. This </seg>
            <seg id="p598">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE treatment will entirely prevent surface run-off of water. It will keep down competing plant growth and thus entirely eliminate that source of loss. At the same time, as it gradually decays it will add the needed organic matter to the soil. Finally it will reduce surface evaporation to the minimum. Therefore, from the standpoint of conserving mois - ture and also from the standpoint of the general welfare of the trees, there is no treatment that will approach mulching in effectiveness. If mulching is used, however, certain precautions are necessary. The whole surface of the ground should not be covered, but strips should be left between the trees which should be given cultivation in order to reduce fire risk. Also, under mulch there is a tendency for the mouse population to build up, and there is greater danger of mouse damage than in orchards receiving some cultivation. Digging up the ground immediately around the trees for a distance of 2 or 3 feet out from the trunk each fall, coupled with a program of poisoning, will usually take care of the mouse injury problem. The advantages of handling orchards in this way are very great indeed, and where there are avail - able supplies of wheat straw, corn fodder, or similar material we would recommend it highly to apple growers, particularly under your conditions. Prof. Wiggans has discussed contouring to prevent water run-off. Under some conditions this will be extremely helpful, and in laying out young orchards, particularly where there is an appreciable slope of the soil, the planting of trees on contours with the handling of the orchard to keep ridges developed will be a real asset. With care, orchards on steep slopes can be maintained in grass mulch and largely prevent surface run-off of water. While the grass will of course use considerable moisture, the amount used by the sod will be compensated for by preventing run-off, particularly if there is much slope to the land. Under such sod conditions it is necessary to fertilize the orchards fairly heavily with nitrogen. Also, there are • distinct advantages in partially breaking such mulches once a year or once in two years in order to incorporate the organic matter into the soil. If the sod is broken up very early in the spring with a disk or heavy spring tooth shortly after frost is out of the ground, it will quickly become reestablished and form a cover by the time heavy sum - mer rains are likely to occur. If carefully handled, such sods will go far to prevent surface run-off even under the conditions prevailing in this section, and probably represent the best method of handling orchards on steep slopes where mulching is impracticable. In orchards on land sufficiently level that run-off and erosion are not serious problems, moderate summer with a late summer seeded cover crop is very satisfactory from the soil moisture point of view. Such cover crops should be worked into the soil In the spring before they pull a great amount of moisture from the soil. With such </seg>
            <seg id="p599">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY crops as rye and winter vetch, seeding should be in August, and they should be worked into the soil in the spring when they begin to head or bloom. Only light cultivation should then be given until the new crop is reseeded. Such a cover crop system reduces competition of trees and cover crop for moisture to a minimum and is effective on fairly level land, if mulching is impracticable. We would not recom - mend it for sloping sites subject to run-off and erosion. In conclusion we would emphasize the problem of conserving the water supply from the time the young orchard is planted as perhaps the most important single problem in orchard soil management in this section. While the trees are young their water requirement is much less than that of the old mature trees. They will grow vigorously on the water that is available and that which has been stored. The grower may not realize, however, that these trees may be drawing on reserves which may be needed in the mature years of the orchard. They may be withdrawing water from the deep subsoil, as Prof. Wiggans has shown. If every effort is made from the time the orchard is young to conserve and hold all the water that falls, it would seem that the rainfall in this section is sufficient to carry even mature orchards during most growing seasons. The fine water-storage capacity of the soil is a tremendous asset. With a clear understanding of your problem we believe it is possible to solve it so that the orchards, at least on the deep soils adjacent to the Missouri River, will have sufficient available water to produce good crops during even dry seasons. On shallower soils the same principles apply although on such soils the hazards of water shortage during dry seasons will be much greater. </seg>

            <seg id="p604">KET" iKT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE THE RIGHT KIND W, W. DERRICK • ■\Vbe:i we speak of the right kind of meat it doesn't mean much be - cause thv right kind of meat In one section of the country is the wrong kind in another section of the country. However, quality and finish are quite necessary to the right kind anywhere. Finish is necessary because lean meat is not as palatable nor is it as healthful as well marbled meat. This was clearly shown by a study of those explorers who lived an entire year on meat. It was my good fortune to make a trip back east last fall and I ■want to take time now to point out some of the things I saw. In Boston I found that the market takes a lot of heavy cattle. When these big cattle are slaughtered they bone out the cuts with a large per - centage of bone and this boned meat is sold as roasts and the like. Of course this meat sells for more and it is worth more as approximately 20&lt;7c bone waste has been removed. While they can handle big cattle in that manner the smaller cattle which most markets demand could not be handled in that way. One day we went down to the docks and watched the fishing boats unload their cargo of fish. It really was quite a sight and later we visited a nsh market and watched the auction of the catch which the boats had brought in. The fish were sold sight unseen as the saying goes for at least there were no samples or indications of what was changing hands. This is quite a marked contrast to the buyer of live - stock who looks every animal over very critically. A great deal of fish is eaten in the east where it is readily available and it is even encroaching into this section. I don't have a bone to pick but fish is a substitute for meat and will take the place of a certain amount of our livestock products. Visiting Xew York I was very much surprised at the number of cattle that are slaughtered in the city. These cattle are bought in Chicago and shipped to New York to be slaughtered rather than being slaughtered in Chicago and shipped to Xew York because the Jewish trade in Xew York demands fresh beef. Xot only must it be fresh but it must be Koshered. or slaughtered according to Jewish religious practices. Xot only is this meat inspected by the regular Federal inspector but also by a Jewish Rabbi who is even more particular than the government inspector and so the meat he declares unfit for the Jewish trade goes back into the regular channels of meat consumption. </seg>
            <seg id="p605">NEBRASKA LIVESTIJCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSMOATIOX Because the meat in the Kosher trade must be fresh, we saw buyers right down on the killing floor buying carcasses as soon as they could see what they were like. While in New York we saw cattle that had been raised and fed in Nebraska and they certainly looked fine. There were also cattle from the Carolinas and Virginia but they lacked a lot of having the quality and finish of our Nebraska cattle. We found this true all down the east coast. The cattle lacked the quality and finish of our middle western livestock. Quality in meat poes a long ways in selling it. In one eastern in - stitution we saw rail after rail of fine quarters that were to go out as boned cuts because they had the quality and finish to make them the right kind. ' 1 . - THK CONSUMER'S MEAT DOIXAR MRS. H. .1. GRAMLICH A hundred years ago woman's ability as a homemaker was measured largely by her ability to do things with her hands. Most of the serv - ices of the home were rendered in the home and the task performed by the homemaker herself. She made the clothes — in most instances, spun the thread and wove the cloth from which these clothes were made. Vegetables were grown, dried and stored and in some in - stances canned for winter use. The year's meat supply was, to a large extent, produced on the home farm: it was butchered at home and with the help of all members of the family circle, was cured and put away for use In the months to come. The handling of money by the house - wife was almost an unknown procedure. The few things that must come from without the home farm resources, — coffee, tea, sugar, spices and such, were usually a result of exchange of produce or bartering by the head of the house — woman's ability to drive home a true bargain was not then known or at least not acknowledged. The years have brought many changes in our routine of living and our ideas concerning the function of the home and the status of the homemaker herself. No longer is she considered general craftsman of the home. Her position has become that of general manager — one might almost say general financier. Now more than two-thirds of all goods sold in the retail stores are bought by women directly and the sale of the other third influenced directly or indirectlv bv the </seg>
            <seg id="p606">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE judgment of women. I probably am safe In saying that your wives buy 98 per cent of the socks and ties which you wear and that most of you take your wives along If you are buying a new hat or suit. I wish the rule worked both ways. Seldom can I lure my husband into a store to pass judgment on a garment for myself. The amount of money spent by women during the course of a year exceeds $21,000,000,000. It Is her task and responsibility to see that this sum is spent wisely and to the best advantage for members of the family for whom she is purchasing agent. The woman of 100 years ago has emerged from her place of obscurity and today she occupies a role of importance and security in the eyes of retailers and merchants who stand between her and her pocketbook. A recent packer publication had an italicized headline, "Our Big Boss, The American Housewife." It is true that the housewives have advanced many ideas and suggestions that are being heeded by meat producers and meat packers. What are the things which influence the housewife most when she goes to the market to buy meat for the family? Normally, three things — suitability for the menu which she has In mind, quality and price. During recent yeai*s, I have had Interesting experiences in planning and buying food for large church groups. Always the menu circled around meat. I think that is more or less true with all meal planning — whether at home or abroad. If the circumstances elect a heavy meat, lighter salads, desserts, etc. follow and vice versa with a lighter meat. In planning meals for the church dinners, It was generally under - stood that If men were to be present, we must have no hamburger, meat loaf or meat disguised in any form. Men like the real thing and plenty of it. Always then, it must be a meat unto itself; beef, pork or lamb, occasionally chicken but not often. Chicken seems to be a woman's delicacy. In purchasing our meat we were, as I have already intimated, guided largely by quality. At the same time, price played an important role^ We tried to figure our cost on the basis of ten cents per serving or less. This period of church activity that I mention was previous to the present high meat prices. At that time lambs were selling low and often found a place on our menus. Even the prize roast ribs of beef and baked ham too were favorites. Now times have changed. People insist on paying less for church meals and the price of food is higher. Still the same thought prevails — "We must have good meat or the men will not come". In discussing the possibilities with a committee for a church dinner for 300 only a few months back, one lady said with a real positiveness that with pork as high as it was at the time we must not even think of serving pork. I wondered, at the moment, if she had made a full comparison </seg>
            <seg id="p607">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION" of prices and values — for other meats were high also — or if her deci - sion had come as a psychological reaction to newspaper comments on meat strikes in Detroit, processing taxes, etc. However, we reached a happy compromise through that old standby, round Swiss steak. Now, too, in planning church dinners, because meat is higher, we look about for cheaper vegetbles, salads and desserts. Cabbage has been elevated to a more important role in replacing Brussels-sprouts, buttered new peas, and delicious fruit salads. There are tricks in all trades and when men are not included in the groups to be served — hence their pleasure is not the foremost thought in mind — women have ways of extending meat flavors that can ease the tension of the purse strings and give fairly satisfactory re - sults. Recently I was asked to serve a church cafeteria luncheon in the cheapest way possible. Since no men were to be present, I de - cided that meat loaf would fill the bill. I purchased 18 pounds of ground beef and 5 lbs. of pork at at an average cost of 14&lt;? per pound, totaling $3.50. To these 23 pounds of meat I added 3 pounds of un - cooked oatmeal, 1 % dozen eggs, a gallon of tomato juice, some onion and other seasonings. The oatmeal, of course, absorbed moisture and increased noticeably the volume of the meat when it was a finished product — namely, 10 good sized meat loaves. The cost, including the oatmeal and seasonings, totaled approximately $4. SO. These meat loaves cut into 160 servings and sold at 5 cents per serving. You can figure for yourself that Old Man Depression was not threatening the church at the time of that luncheon. Perhaps someone is wondering just what is traveling through the housewife's mind when she purchases meat for her own table; almost the same things that I have described in the above paragraphs. We wish to please members of our family in a satisfying economical man - ner. I find that men, whether at home or away, prefer meat that is not of the ground-up, added-to, made-over, or extended variety. The younger generaation, however, have a particularly strong liking for the hamburger type. Less than two weeks ago I called the family to dinner and had on the table a choice rolled rib roast. Lois, our daugh - ter of ten, gave a fleeting glance at the meat platter and said, "Mother, why can't we ever have something good? Why can't we have weiners, or sausage, or meat loaf or hamburger?" Our daughter's distaste, rather her taste, for meat is a standing joke in our family. With her father particularly interested in animal husbandry work and his years of service with the National Meat Board, one would expect that he would have instilled into his offspring some fondness for meat. A few years ago when Lois was about seven years old, just able to read, we were on the highway and met a live stock truck. On the front end was a placard, placed there probably by this National Meat Board of which I speak. With a quick glance Lois read the placard "Eat </seg>
            <seg id="p608">REPOUT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE More Meat" and turned quickly to her father and in fleeting words said "Not me, Daddy, they can't make me eat more meat". So you see my husband has yet certain educational propaganda which he must, " in some manner, carry over to members of his family. However, we have the two extremes. We have in our home a little niece who is about the same age as Lois. Were Barbara Jean given her choice she 1 would limit her diet almost entirely to meat, baked potatoes and milk. Consequently, there is need for guidance in the appetites of both children. Lois is not alone in her liking for hamburger. The di - rector of our college cafeteria for university young people tells me that hamburgers are a universal favorite with her patrons. With these things in mind the thoughtful housewife must serve various kinds and classes of meat. Price, as well as the children's tastes, have been a factor in recent months in causing Mother to per - suade Father frequently that hamburger and meat loaf are not to be wholly tabooed from the family table. As a result, ground meat sales have increased enormously — from two to three times the usual amount. One of our local meat dealers told my husband that during the harvest season, meat loaf had almost entirely taken the place of beef roasts formerly served to the threshing crews. This bears out the statistical facts that hamburger sales last year went from double to triple their usual amount. Because Mrs. American Housewife is keenly alert to the job of spending and saving she has certain very definite things in mind when she enters the meat shop. She buys meat, not only for its food value, the protein it contains, but for its palatability and flavor, and for the stimulating effect it has for the other dishes being served with it. It was Shakespeare who said "I am one that am nourished by my victuals and would feign have meat". Usually, I think, we buy the best meat we can afford, interspersing after special indulgences with cuts of lesser costs. That means T-bone steaks only occasionally because of the large amount of bone which I is a part of this aristocratic cut. Personally nothing seems to me so delicious as a well-aged T-bone steak from a perfectly fitted animal. I look forward from fall to fall to the sale time of the 4-H baby beeves and the delicious steaks which these carcasses afford. In selecting beef we prefer the beef with the bright red color, the lean generously flecked with fat, the fat portion creamy and firm in appearance. This marbled fat is produced in properly fed annuals — animals fed corn and not too much grass. For best flavor we like animals not too young. Veal is par - ticularly lacking in flavor and does not give the satisfaction that comes from eating more mature meat. There is talk that the younger car - casses offer a greater surety of tenderness but I heard a gentleman say recently, "I would rather chew a while if necessary and get the, flavor". </seg>
            <seg id="p609">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION Fortunately, or unfortunately, it Is beyond me to say which, many public institutions are using the very young meat animals because of tenderness, which as I said eai'lier, is almost a surety but which is greatly lacking in flavor. Mr. Gramlich and I recently had a striking example of the contrast of flavor between meat of the veal type and the beef from animals which had matured a few months longer. We were with friends for dinner and on the table was served a luscious beef roast which had weighed before it went into the roaster probably twelve or fourteen pounds. It had been cooked with a long, slow heat. The meat was placed in the oven at 1:00 and served at 7:00. It lacked nothing in tenderness and deliciousness of flavor. The next evening we were at dinner in a semi-public eating house. There we were served broiled veal steaks. The meat was so white and colorless when it came to the table that at first glance it was difficult to tell whether we were being served beef or pork. As the dinner progressed, one of the guests made so bold as to ask for a bottle of steak sauce in order that he might give added zest to his serving of meat. Needless to say in my husband's and my minds there were thoughts of the delicious beef served the evening before that had come from an animal probably 14 to 18 months of age. The housewife prefers meat that comes from animals 12 to 18 months old and experience has taught her that proper cooking will bring out any needed tenderness. I mentioned earlier that T-bono steaks were an occasional luxury in our home. Someone is asking what meats most frequently find their way to our table. I am fond of the flavor that comes with highly finished meat but because of pocketbook limitations, must most frequently purchase the cuts that are not heavily coated with fat. This, I believe, is generally true with most house - wives. The large circle of fat in the T-bone steak is almost entire waste when it comes from the broiler to the table. The round, fat flecked steak from the same animal is almost all edible meat and pound for pound provides more food value at a lesser cost even though the round and T-bone retail at the same price which they do in many smaller shops. The flank steaks offer a good value for everyday meals. To be made tender, they must be cooked long and slowly. There is absolutely no waste and the flavor is delicious. Shoulder cuts also serve many useful purposes. In buying meat for home my procedure is much the same as I practiced when buying for groups in the church. I must buy good meat — meat to please the man of the house and at a total cost that will satisfy the purse. At home I feel that if I have spent more than 10 cents per serving for meat I have been extravagant. Because we must have meat, when buying in an era of high prices, I am more care - ful to buy the leaner cuts and cuts with a small percentage of bone. </seg>
            <seg id="p610">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE I spend more time and thought when meat prices are high In develop - ing tenderness of the cheaper cuts through proper methods of cookery. Boiling beef, pot roasts, and stew meats are coming more to the front. A meat retailer recently told me that he attributed this trend not only to an effort to reduce meat cost but as a result of the almost unlimited quantities of fresh vegetables accessible on our markets today. With fresh vegetables fairly reasonable, it is possible to serve a most appetizing boiled dinner if skillfully prepared. The boned, rolled rib roasts will always be a favorite of mine for company meals and for the family as frequently as price will permit. Rolled ribs from a well fed animal are so juicy with fat and well flavored that no tricks in cookery are necessary to make it the king of roasts. Should any be left it can be warmed easily in its natural state or is delicious served cold — a factor not to be overlooked. A friend of mine who buys for a large family recently told me of some of her practices in buying meat. Within the last two weeks she purchased almost a whole pork loin at 17 cents per pound. From the lower part of this loin she cut a section which she used to boil with vegetables, from one end she cut pork chops for a dinner and used the remainder for a pork roast to be served warm and later sliced cold. Had she purchased the chops as chops they would have cost 29 cents per pound, hence buying the piece as a whole was quite a saving. A favorite purchase of beef by this same friend is to buy a large rump, the tougher part she grinds for hamburger, the side that has come from next the round she cuts off and prepares as Swiss steak. The part that is left after being cooked long and slowly comes to the table in the form of a delicious beef roast. Here again a considerable sav - ing is made because the meat is pm-chased in a large piece. This friend might make even a greater saving by purchasing a large chuck roast; she would obtain almost the same variety of servings by grind - ing the section near the neck, slicing Swiss steaks from the opposite side and roasting the remainder. The percentage of bone in the chuck is much less than in the rump, rump averaging about 24 per cent bone — almost one-fourth, while chuck averages about 17 per cent bone or about one-sixth. Frequently we are deceived in buying meat by, failing to be "bone-conscious". Spare ribs are a striking example, at present the retail price is 21&lt;i per pound; this sounds like a good buy but to figure the actual price per pound one should multiply by two because spareribs are 50 per cent bone. Even more might be justly added be - cause of the great shrinkage in cooking due to the large amount of fat. I have but briefly mentioned methods of meat cookery. Judging from my own home experience I feel that it is not to any great pur - pose to dwell on ways and means of cooking meat when talking to a group of gentlemen. I judge that you gentlemen are much like my </seg>
            <seg id="p611">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION husband — if the meat comes to the table attractive in appearance, flavor and tenderness you do not question the whys and wherefores as to how it was done. I cannot resist, however, showing you this meat thermometer and suggesting that as a matter of economy you make your wives birthday presents of ones similar. By cooking meat slowly, from 300 to 350°, oven heat, much better results are obtained than when meat is cooked rapidly. This meat thermometer, inserted properly, tells exactly when the product has finished cooking. The more tender roasts should be placed in an uncovered roaster and no liquid added. By adhering to proper temperatures there is much less loss due to shrinkage. A recent interesting experiment was carried on; two practically identical 14 pound beef roasts were taken from opposite sides of the same animal. One was roasted at a low tem - perature and removed from the oven when the meat thermometer registered that it was well done. The second roast was cooked at tem - peratures from 350 to 475°, and cooked a much shorter time. When both roasts were weighed the first one had shrunk only 1 lb. 14 oz. while the second one cooked at high heat had shrunk 5 lbs. We usually figure three servings to a pound of beef, the difference in these cooked roasts was approximately three pounds or really a difference of ten servings. So I say again, buy your wives meat and oven thermo - meters and you might even linger in the kitchen sometimes to see that they are being used. , Women have developed certain ideas regarding the care and handling of meat that undoubtedly add to the cost of meat but which give satisfaction in service rendered and for which we are willing to pay. Housewives want the retail meat store to be a modern one. It must have refrigerated cases and a wide selection of products on dis - play. They want the store at which they trade to be bright and at - tractive in appearance and to contain all the modern conveniences which insure sanitation and cleanliness. Housewives, if they do their purchasing personally, rather than by telephone, like to have stores conveniently located. This accounts for the fact that there are now far more neighborhood retail stores than in years past. The stores must be accessible either for herself or for the children whom she may send to make the purchase. Another thing which the housewife is insistent upon is honesty in advertising. Because she herself is not always able to go to market and must direct the purchase through some member of her family, she likes to have faith in the merchant with whom the purchase is to be made. Recently Mr. Gramlich and I noticed an advertisement of a store in a neighboring city. The store was one of the chiseling type. Pork chops were advertised at 20 cents per pound. No qualifications were made in the advertisement. Mr. Gramlich knew that pork loins were selling at the time at 22 cents per pound wholesale. We happened </seg>
            <seg id="p612">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE at this particular time to be in this neighboring city and made it a point to drop into this store and note the progress in the sale of pork chops. We noticed in the case two piles of chops, one pile of chops from very fat rangy hogs, most undesirable in appearance. We asked the price and it was Quoted as 20 cents per pound. Further on in the case were some fairly good chops priced at 28 cents per pound. While we were standing there, a little girl, probably 12 years of age, came in and ordered a pound of pork chops. The clerk took chops from the better pile placed them on the scales and told the girl he had 30 cents worth and wanted to know if that was O. K. She gave her assent, paid for the package and went on her way. The unfortunate thing is that probably the mother did not have in her home a pair of scales and most likely she will be laboring under the illusion that she bought her pork chops at 20 cents per pound. I say that we demand honesty in advertising. Perhaps that will soonest come if the housewife herself stays keenly alert to methods of merchants of good standing with whom she deals, and is not too often tempted by what appear to be bargain prices in stores of questionable standards. Recently I had an experience in our own city of Lincoln. A new store had just come into being. The prices seemed so very attractive that I bought more than I had intended to when first entering the store. Hamburger was selling at 10 cents a pound. The standard price was two pounds for 25 cents. Apples were 6 pounds for twenty - five cents when everywhere else the price was 5 pounds for a quarter. Potatoes sold at an equally attractive discount. Red grapes were two pounds for 15 cents when the market price was 10 cents per pound. Other prices seemed attractive likewise. When I reached home and opened my packages to give the dog her share of the two pounds of hamburger, it occurred to me that the amount seemed small. I placed it on the scales and found that I was one-fourth pound short. That aroused my indignation and I weighed all the packages to find each in turn from four ounces to one-half pound short in weight. I was provoked at myself for having diverged from a well authorized store of good standing and indignant that I had been tempted by the flare of what seemed unusual bargains. Hastily, I gathered all the bundles together and went back to the proprietor of the store. I had all the weights written on paper and asked him to place the packages on the scale in order that I migh verify the things I had to tell him. No argument ensued. He simply restored my money and I gave him the packages but I left the store with the firm resolution that it was best to trade with merchants of an established reputable standing. I am glad to have met with a group of producers of good meat. It is good to live out here in the open West where things are in the process of being grown. As all of you know, the states west of the Mississippi raise approximately % of our nation's meat and the more </seg>
            <seg id="p613">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION densely populated regions farther east eat nearly % of It. It is an interesting experience to poke about among the shops of our eastern cities, and to see there the beautifully finished beef that we know has come from our western country. Mr. Gramlich and I had a pleasant experience last June in New York City. "We went to the Hotel New Yorker in celebration of our twentieth wedding anniversary. After a most delicious dinner, Mr. Gramlich asked the floorman as we were leaving the dining room if he knew what beef he was serving. The floorman though a moment and said it was Atterbury beef from Dakota. "Atterbury!", exclaimed Mr. Gramlich, "Atterbury! You mean from Nebraska, don't you?" With a confused look the man responded, "Nebraska, Oh yes yes, Nebraska". I presume that when one has lived always in New York City, Nebraska, Dakota, Iowa and Kansas are probably much one and the same but to Mr. Gramlich, Atterbury meant only Nebraska because Mr. Atterbury is one of our outstanding beef producers from the western part of the state and he had topped the Chicago market every week last spring with his finely fed beef animals. It made us feel good to realize that out home this fine deli - cious beef which we had so enjoyed was being produced and we were glad that we came from the state where things live and grow even in spite of an occasional drouth year. THE RETAILER'S JOB P. L. VAN WAGENEN Mr. Chairman; Professor Loeffel; Ladies and Gentlemen: I have been asked to discuss the subject "The Retailer's Job". In - asmuch as my experience has been in the buying and selling of meats, I will endeavor to discuss it from that angle. Being with the Safeway organization for several years, I may from time to time refer to our companies policies as regards Producer and Consumer. Modern meat merchandising is a big subject. Naturally, I am going to discuss it entirely from the retailer's view-point. Our company does not do any slaughtering and we are not packers, as you recognize the term. All we have to do is sell the meat to Mrs. Jones after all the in - between steps have been taken. Of course, if any of those steps have been wrongly taken; if any faltering or careless steps have accumulated; if any wasteful methods have accrued; if any greed or selfishness has raised its ugly and costly head any place, of course, we, the retailers, get all the blame from the consumer, suffer the boycott and get so many mental kicks in the </seg>
            <seg id="p614">REPORT OK NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE pants, it's no wonder we can't sit down, stand up, walk, think or talk, without unconsciously dodging and wondering — what next? Understand, we are not discouraged. We just want to get all the cards on the table — face up. We want to definite the situation. Definitions are often enlightening. One time I heard a speaker define -what a banker was. Ever hear it? Well, he said, "A banker is a man who will loan you an umbrella when the sun is shining — and take it away from you when it starts to rain." Remember now, I said some - one else defined a banked that way — not I. Besides, I can't be sure who is in the audience. Modern meat merchandising encompasses much more than a flashy tiled' meat case. Bricks and mortar, cans and packages, weiners and tenderloins, clean smocks, sharp tools and trained meat cutters are not sufficient to insure successful retail operations. The illusive something that makes this entire operation "click" is more precious than gold — and a lot harder to get. It's the plan behind the fixtures, the goal clearly visualized by every interested mind. It's the organiza - tion team spirit, determination for honest results that finally ma - terializes intelligently coordinated, resultful sales activity. This is where we come into the picture. History, in the meat business, shows that for all these years since fresh meats became significant, very little actual work has been done on the highly important job of better retail selling. You as producers have done remarkable work in development of better types of meat animals. Your schools and interested agencies have carefully studied feeds, pastures, stock varieties, tubercular control, range preservation, etc., serving to developing better animals. When the animals left your hands, the packers went to work. Through research, modern engineering and practical knowledge, they have developed the curing and processing job to a high point. They have developed their buyers and their wholesale salesmen to the last degree so that up to the time the carcass lands in the retailer's hands, we find a very thorough job has been done in production and process - ing, but who — who please — has worried much about selling the con - verted article? There has been much talk about doing something but little action has actually materialized. Yours is not an over-produced Industry. You seldom have a sur - plus. Beef prices being high, though, has caused much switching in retail buying to cheaper substitute foods. How are you going to get back this volume? The obvious answer is — ADVERTISE, and I see that Fred Hobart, of Pampus, Texas said in the November American Cattle Producer that you should charge from one to two dollars a car </seg>
            <seg id="p615">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION for an advertising fund. I'll bet that was not a too popular suggestion, but it's a practical solution anyway and should merit your careful con - sideration. Nearly all the leaders who express themselves on your problem agree. President Freeman of the California Cattlemen's Association said at their convention at San Francisco, "The problem of the farmer is to get his products to the consumer at prices that consumers can afford to pay." This suggests the desirability of using the facilities of the chain store or any other agency that can really furnish low-cost distribution. President Franklin D. Roosevelt said, "Our present problem is not how to produce but rather how to distribute goods." This also sug - gests that modern systems of retailing should be encouraged in the matter of distribution. Harper Sibley, President of the U. S. Chamber of Commerce, said three weeks ago at San Francisco, that the Hawaiian Islands, were nearly ideal for cattle raising. There the cattle have no diseases, no lump-jaw or T. B. You never have to buy feed for there is plenty of pasture. The only trouble is — there is not any market for the product — no one can use it without tremendous shipping charges. Again, may I say it looks like the modern American retailer with multiple outlets and low-cost distribution is your natural alley and yet it seems at times the producer and the retailers are total strangers. Isn't it tragic? Think of all the millions of dollars invested in the meat business from ranch to packer to retailer, and yet we are jeopardiz - ing all of it because we don't know each other and act as if we didn't want to know each other. We are like a pugnacious kid with a new pair of pants. He is proud of them but he will knock the block off of anybody who mentions that they are new. Everyone is proud of the accomplishments of the past in the meat industry, but why should we try to knock the block off of anybody who leads out in the obviously necessary and plainly practical plan of wanting to sell beef as cheaply as possible and yet realize a net profit, to the end that greater and greater consumption may be encouraged and builded, and greater and greater market outlets thereby furnished? Yet it is being done every - day. Yes, we are still strangers but think this over. It's an old estab - lished principle of distribution that "The producer receives for his product what the consumer pays, less the costs of distribution." Think that over for a minute, "The producer receives for his product what the consumer pays, less the costs of distribution." If that be true, and no one can truthfully say that it is not true, then isn't it to your advantage as producers, to join hands with those retail agencies which have low-cost distribution facilities readily available? Our company, and others like us, are indispensable in your business picture. </seg>

            <seg id="p618">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Every retailer's first thought is to keep his store profitable. No one can blame him for that. There is an old adage which says, "A man is judged by the company he keeps." I would change that slightly and bring it up-to-date by saying, "That a business man is judged by the company he keeps — solvent." This brings up the subject of selling as practiced by our cornpany. The facts following are not recited from a historical standpoint. They are given to portray an example of modern high geared, coordinated selling. They are offered in the hope that the plan may give a prac - tical idea of how meat consumption can be increased, as your industry or as any similar retail companies, can go to the expense and trouble that Safeway Stores has in this expensive but resultful plan. In a nutshell, our plan has demonstrated again and again that meat sales can be increased, without cutting price, even when weather, market supply, price and general economic conditions are unfavorable. Let us set up a little scenery as a back ground for the campaign which we conducted last fall to increase beef consumption. The situa - tion called for prompt action. Markets were flooded with drought stricken cattle. Prices were sinking rapidly. Newspapers were filled with discouraging stories about the half-starved cattle which were I being slaughtered. Terrible pictures of boney, gaunt, skinny cattle greeted you from every movie, in every magazine, from newspapers front pages and the radio carried dramatic sequences that turned peoples stomachs against eating beef. We didn't wait for our beef sales to stop before anything was done, we didn't appeal to the producer or any association for funds or ideas. "We did not solicit any stock raiser for aid in any way. We took the bull by the horns ourselves. We dispatched bulletins to ! our operating heads in twenty-one states. Special banners were prepared and shipped to all stores. ! Sales meetings were called and our twenty thousand employees were enthused to tackle this big job. Special ad headlines were rushed to more than eight hundred newspapers and a nation-wide campaign to stem the tide of disaster for beef producers was launched with a bang. Thirty-four hundred retail markets started talking about "good beef". The slogan adopted was "Good I beef is still available", and ads ex - plained that although drought conditions had seriously affected the cattle industry, still, due to the splendid facilities of the modern packer, the prime beef was still to be had and consumers could buy with no fear of getting starved animals.!

It was bought through the regular channels and every executive was directed to sell this good meat on a profitable basis. The campaign was a big success, when conditions are allowed for. In six days we sold 2,655,105 pounds of beef, and realized an actual sales increase of 43%. When twenty thousand trained salesmen tackle a job together — something has to move — this time it was six thousand cattle. This huge movement into immediate consumption of tons of beef, stimulated the market for a time, but the big result was that people were induced to try meat again to see that it was still good and to quit taking so seriously the terrible stories that they read. We are proud of the results achieved by our boys behind the counter who through their combined interested efforts into this event and who through word of mouth relieved the fear that was in the peoples mind. The entire campaign was profitable to all concerned. We paid the going price for our supplies. We can't set markets and we don't set markets. Supply and demand does that. We control no source of supply In any commodity, but we do have distributional facilities ready at all times to promptly function on any worthy activity. An even flow of merchandise from the ranch to the table should be your goal — not gluts or shortages. We are trying to help accomplish that ambition and we believe that in multiple store merchandising lies your best highway, to a fulfillment of your distress. Nation's Business Magazine, in May, 1935, referred to our campaigns as the most prac - tical kind of farm relief. Campaigns of this nature are conducted throughout the organiza - tion on many farm commodities. Secretary of Agriculture Wallace, in his annual report to the President recommended "an increase reduction of the spread between farmer and consumer prices." We submit, ladies and gentlemen, that our system of merchandising is builded and conducted in strict ad - herence to this policy. Right today we have in progress our fourth annual campaign to increase the consumption of beef. The week of January 6. These things, surely are evidence of our sincerity in behalf of American Agriculture. Producers, distributors and consumers should work together on problems of national significance. In closing, we want to express our sincere appreciation for this opportunity to tell you of our past and present efforts to increase the consumption of beef and other farm commodities. Let's not be strangers anymore. Let's work out — together, a better future for production and distribution In this good country of ours. </seg>

WATERBURY, : Manager, Armour and Company, South Omaha, Nebraska, Jan. 7, 1936 at the Annual Nebraska Live Stock Breeders and Feeders Ass'n at Lincoln, Nebr. The invitation of Professor Loeffel to appear on your program was especially interesting to me, as I feel that we are in a period of evolu - tion in consumer's taste for meat that is going to have a very definite effect on the live stock and meat industry during the next decade. The subject assigned me for this talk was "The Kind of Meat We Like to Handle", but in a sense this simply means the kind of meat which the consumers prefer. We like to handle any livestock which can be processed into wholesale meats, but we naturally do not like to handle animals which the consumer is unwilling to purchase or animals which cost producers more to make ready for market than they will realize. If I can say a little something which will help some feeders to realize that the price we can pay for cattle is determined by the price con - sumers pay for meat and if, further, I can give them an idea of what that consumer likes, I think my address will have served a useful purpose. This past year the housewife's dollar has had to buy a larger amount of meat than could be purchased in the higher priced grades, and as a result the consumption both of sausage and hamburger has increased tremendously. In the future we must keep in mind the fact that the ability to market the most expensive cuts is only possible in all sections of this country when those cuts are small or medium In size. The average family budget does not permit expenditures for heavy, rich cuts of beef that retail at prices above 35 cents a pound. If this quality of meat is to be consumed, it can only be purchased in small quantities. Modern dietary habits no longer require the large quantities of food at one meal that were characteristic a quarter of a century ago, and the old-fashioned fifteen to twenty pound roasts of beef are relics of the past. In part this change has come about from the decrease in number of people doing heavy manual labor, but in larger part, it is a direct result of the change from private homes to small apartments. The electric grill and the gas plate used in many families are not designed for preparing large meat cuts. Because of this type of retail demand GOO to 700 pound heifers sell at far better prices in relation to the cost of production than fat steers weighing 1200 pounds or more. The big steers produce cuts for outlets whose num - bers are restricted — hotels, clubs, restaurants and public institutions — while their use in private homes is even more limited due to the amount </seg>
            <seg id="p621">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION of trimming of cuts to make them attractive for family use and the expense thereby incurred. One important outlet for the forequarters of heavy cattle is the sale of Kosher beef, the hinds being taken by buyers for hotels, institutions, etc. In fact, there is sufficient demand from this better trade to use all the cuts from heavy cattle at a good price as long as the proportion of such steers slaughtered remains around 10 to 12 per cent. On the other hand, the lightweight heifers and steers of corresponding size produce cuts which the average home can use readily and for which a much broader demand exists. Over a period of years American tastes have changed from heavy cuts of Beef, heavy hams and big joints of mutton, to steaks, chops, lightweight hams and legs of lamb. We have come to describe certain classes of cattle, lambs or hogs as being the "chain store" type. This is simply another way of saying that they are suitable for the average home, and certain types of stores are catering more directly to the demands of the housewife than some of the old type marketing facili - ties formerly did. Probably the most characteristic feature of this demand is the light-weight already referred to. This demand is, of course directly contradictory to the desire of livestock men for large framed, quick growing animals that will handle large quantities of feed and will convert these feeds into meat at low cost. Consequently, in meeting this demand for light weights, producers must try con - stantly to improve the efficiency of feed utilization by small animals and at the same time maintain rapid gains. In cattle there have been several attempts to solve this question. Right after the war animals of dairy blood, supplied the demand for light weights, while others marketed were some of the smaller-framed cattle of the South, and still others were half-fattened cattle of larger build. In some respects baby beef has been a solution, but true baby beef is expensive to produce and does not have the mature flavor that the epicure desires. Too frequently it is neither beef nor veal. Half fattened cattle still further lack flavor, because their meat has not ripened during the limited feeding period. The solution of this problem of making small sized, well flavored beef cuts has not yet been reached. Approximately 60 per cent of the carcass beef business in finished steers and heifers now calls for cattle weighing from 900 to 1050 lbs. Probably the ideal steer of the future will weigh less, perhaps 800 to 1000 lbs. He must be fat and certainly must be well finished by the time he is two years of age. Cattle of these weights will pro - duce cuts of the size most widely desired by consumers, providing they have the proper conformation and finish. In spite of the fact that the annual value of livestock and meat in this country exceeds the value of the output of any other industry, the importance of the beef cattle business based on per capital live- </seg>
            <seg id="p622">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE stock population, or per capita beef consumption, has been declining steadily since 1890. Part of this decline has been overcome by the increased slaughter of dairy animals. By this practice, the cull dairy cows and the dairy calves, both of which are by-products of the dairy industry, supply the demand for the cheaper quality of beef and for most of the veal. Plain grass-fed range cattle can no longer compete economically with the dairy cattle for this trade in the cheaper grades of meat. The dairyman sells his animals for what he can get since original cost has usually been obtained from long before marketing through the milk and butter they produced. Cattle population has never been stationary. Just now we are in the reduction stage, but we are very near the bottom. These variations in the cattle population during the past fifty years have occurred with sufficient regularity that both cattlemen and packers have been able to use these swings of production for forecasting the future supply of slaughter animals. These swings have continued for seven to nine years in each direction. Had it not been for the drouth and the government program of cattle purchase, cattle production would have been at a peak this year. However, 1934 disturbed the regular cattle cycle and the reduction of between seven to eight million head in cattle population during 1934 brought the industry to a position much like the trough of the production cycle. The 1934 calf crop from approximately a peak population was sufficiently large to offset part of the losses due to the drouth. However, there is no question but that the general trend has been downward through 1935. As yet I have not seen the Government's estimate of cattle popula - tion for January 1, 1936, but even though it should prove to be the low point in cattle population for the current cycle, it is not likely that it will drop under the low population of 192S. On the first of that year cattle numbers were estimated at 57 million head. Last year the estimate was bO'/fc million. Recently the Bureau of Agricultural Economics reported the outlook for a slight decrease in Cattle num - bers as of this date. Nevertheless I suspect that there will be around 60 million cattle on farms and ranches when the estimate comes out, unless the base for estimate is changed on the strength of the 1934 census. If this is done, of course, revisions of the estimates back - wards will have to be made as well. We may expect a relatively small calf crop in 193G due to the large proportion of she-stock in the 1935 slaughter. For the first nine months of 1935 cows and heifers averaged 52.5 per cent of the federal in - spected slaughter as compared to an average of 44.7 per cent for the six years following 1928. Fortunately this unbalanced slaughter of females does not come from the range country. There has been a heavy movement from the important dairy states and from the south, </seg>
            <seg id="p623">609 NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION whereas marketing from the north central states, except Kansas, nas been considerably below that of 1934. Livestock markets' receipts from the far west have been relatively small, except in the state of California. Responsibility for the heavy slaughter of cows and heifers lies In large part in the disposal of cattle reacting from the tuberculosis test and also of those showing a positive response to the tests for con - tagious abortion (Bang's disease). A less important factor in the heavy slaughter of 1935 was the importation of cattle from Canada and Mexico. While practically all of the Canadian cattle and most of the Mexican cattle have gone to the block, there is an appreciable proportion of Mexican feeders still in the feed lots. The exact numbers are difficult to ascertain. One of the most hopeful signs In anticipation of improved beef for American consumers is the interest stimulated in purebred animals for breeding purposes. There has been an increase of 25 to 40 per cent in the sales of registered breeding animals of the principal beef breeds. To me this seems to assure that many of the herds decimated or even destroyed by the drouth of 193 4 are being rebuilt with foun - dation animals of much superior quality to those replaced. Prob - ably there has never been a time in history when range herds have had a similar opportunity to cull their breeding stock, and at the same time introduce well bred foundation animals on so large a scale.. The quality of the livestock marketed in years to come will indicate whether or not this opportunity has been grasped. In recent years there has been a great deal of interest in meat grading, with especial reference to beef. Housewives have usually found more uncertainty in the quality of beef they have been buying than in any other class of meat. In common with many people we be - lieve that grading and stamping beef might remove a certain amount of this uncertainty. However, meat grading is a difficult operation and any of the systems which have been proposed will be difficult to administer. It has taken Armour and Company six or eight years to put into effect the wholesale grading we now use and it is necessary to visit our graders at least once a month to check their ideas and keep their concept of our standards uniform. We object to a compulsory system of Government grading because we feel that the establishment of such a system would retard the flow of meat into consumption. Especially do we believa this would be true with the consumption of the lower grades of beef. This kind of meat will always be coming to the market, and it certainly would not help its distribution to put a brand on it that would stigmatize it by calling the attention of the purchaser to its inferior quality. We believe that in many sections of the country where it is difficult to produce </seg>
            <seg id="p624">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE prime and choice animals, due to the small amount of grain available, the livestock producers would be seriously disappointed if a compulsory - grading system were to be established. Especially in the grass country will beef breeders find that their cattle will not grade as high in the beef as their breeding would seem to warrant. We feel certain that Government grading would develop a tendency toward poor workmanship on the part of packers, because once the Government grades is on the meat the packer who can cut corners and who can deliver product within the grade at the cheapest price will have an advantage. In, such cases less attention would be given the meat after it was graded. For this reason we believe that compulsory meat grading would react against the morale of the packing industry. Before closing I should like to say a few words about the pork and lamb end of our business. Hogs and pork are really the base for packing house operations, and the fundamental factor in packer's profits. The fact that periods of large production and periods of large consumption do not synchronize makes it necessary for the packer to carry large quantities of Pork from the one period to the other. This in the early history of the packing business was usually profitable. However, in later years it- has been an extremely speculative process, quite as frequently resulting in losses as in gains. Nebraska hog men, as well as most others, have reduced their breeding herds to a very low point. This has cut our rate of slaughter nearly in half and has caused unemployment in the packing industry in Omaha as well as in other packing centers. These conditions will last well into next summer, but after that the Government estimates an increase in hog marketings. The rate at which the different pork cuts are purchased when offered for sale readily indicates the sizes and kind of cuts which house - wives prefer. In turn the packer buyers look for hogs which will pro - duce cuts of those desired weights and a price discrimination is made against hogs which do not meet the requirements specified by the con - sumers. We find that consumer preference demands that bacon should average around 2 inches thick and be 8 to 10 inches wide. If it is under an inch thick or more than 2% inches thick or over 12 inches wide, it must be discounted sharply. Bacon to produce the best frying result must not be too lean. If is too lean it is tough and stringy, if it is overly fat there is too great waste in the frying pan. The ham that is needed must be plump and short shanked, not too lean, nor overly fat. If the light average ham carries over an inch and a half of fat or a 16 Ib. ham carries over 2 inches of fat at the center of the ham, that ham must be skinned. I might say in passing, however, that Ne - braska and nearby territory uses practically no regular hams. By regular I mean hams that have not been skinned — and Nebraska does </seg>
            <seg id="p625">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION not get as good flavored hams as those territories that take hams with the fat on. A good ham, like a good piece of beef, must have streaks of fat running through' the lean or it is dry and tasteless. Loins and shoulder cuts are the principal pork products sold fresh. Loins may weigh from G lbs. to 22 lbs., but the 8 to 10 lbs. and 10 to 12 lbs. loins that will throw four or five chops to the pound seem to have the preference. The quality of pork preferred by house - wives affects the price of hogs. Hogs fed on meat meal and dairy products with small grains, will yield the meatiest carcasses. Their fat will be firmer than obtains by any other method of feeding. Hogs which are corn fed at the end of 24 to 36 hours in the cooler are per - fectly firm and can be made into cuts that will satisfy the trade from the standpoint of appearance as well as flavor. Hogs that have been fed whole soy beans or have not had anything but grass will not firm up in the cooler regardless of how long they may be held there. As a result the cuts are flabby and soft, the fat is yellow and the meat is stringy and coarse. Such cuts must be very heavily discounted and if too soft and flabby must be trimmed out for sausage. The lard is soft and oily and doesn't satisfy the trade. With the hog population on farms so low at the present time, it should be easier to effect changes now that will improve the type of hogs that reach the packing house in the future. However, when the market asks for hogs that will produce better hams, loins and sides, and less lard, it gets a supply of thin, underfinished hogs, whose in - ferior products more than offset any advantage gained from the reduc - tion in the lard supply. On the other hand, when a highly finished: hog is in demand we usually receive a supply of short, chuffy hogs whose carcasses carry too much fat in proportion to lean. The Danes seem to have solved this problem and as a result Danisli bacon on the English market commands a good premium. Their hog carcasses are firm, with a high percentage of lean to fat. They have developed a type of hog which matures fairly early and their hogs are slaughtered at a weight of 170 to 210 lbs. or 220 lbs. This type of hog does not lend itself to the consumption of corn that we produce In this territory, but we must be thinking of producing a hog that is somewhere between the Chuffy type that develops too much fat and the Big hog type which produces an unfinished product when marketed at weights that are satisfactory to the consuming public. The Big hog type develops a ham that is quite unsatisfactory because of its extremely long shank and thin body. It does produce a good grade of bacon but the hams are quite unsatisfactory. I want to say just a word about soft pork and to warn hog feeders against feeding whole soy beans to hogs. Soy beans are not grown ex - tensively in Nebraska as yet, but the acreage of soy beans in the corn </seg>
            <seg id="p626">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE belt is on the Increase. We have noticed more soft hogs right along with the increase in soy bean production. Results at several Agri - cultural Experiment Stations have shown that pork produced from hogs fed whole soy beans as a source of protein to balance their corn ration, will invariably be soft. When hogs of that kind come to market we cannot distinguish them alive, but they simply do not become firm when dressed. The bacon is limp like a dishrag even at refrigerator temperature. The lard from hogs fed whole soy beans is soft at ordin - ary temperatures and is difficult to dispose of due to its oily appear - ance. The problem of utilizing soy beans as a hog feed is solved when the oil is extracted and the soy bean oil meal is used for feed. The kind of hog that is most in demand, therefore, is one that will produce an attractive side of bacon and a plump ham at a live weight ranging from 180 lbs. to 240 lbs. The hog must have had proper feeding to produce cuts of the highest grades. Nebraska lamb feeders are to be commended on the fine lambs they finish for slaughter, but the state of Nebraska certainly does not eat much lamb, if we are to believe the retailers to whom we supply meat. Why would it not be a good idea to eat more of this Nebraska-produced lamb right here in Nebraska? The eastern markets we supply require lambs that are fat, well covered over the back and loin, and lambs with plump legs. The live weight should range between 80 and 90 pounds in order to produce the size of chops and legs of lamb that the eastern housewives ask for. And now, just a word about the care of lambs in the feed lot. Barb wire fences do considerable damage to many lamb fleeces. If lambs ; could be bought with clean fleeces free from burrs and trash they would return a better price to the feeder. Lambs should have shelter which should be kept dry, for lambs with wet fleeces are likely to de - velop colds. Wet surroundings lead to discoloration of the skin and flesh and lower the value of the meat. In closing I feel that I cannot emphasize too strongly that success in the future for the live stock and meat industry lies in an intelligent study of consumer demand and the adoption of measures to adjust production and processing to meet this demand more closely. Meat is not the only protein food available to the average' family and if meat is to maintain its position it must be produced efficiently in order that prices will not turn buyers to some other product, for meat still has a stronger appeal to consumers than competing foods. This is a big undertaking and will require the devoted attention of producer, packer • and retailer to yield success. Yet I am sure that if this problem can be solved, American producers will do their part, and I believe that all of us will take steps to avoid reducing the United States to the same </seg>
            <seg id="p627">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION level of meat consumption that exists in the older established nations. We have a real task to perform and I know we will attack it willingly, hopefully and effectively. OUR TASK H. J. GRAMLICH As animal husbandmen we are responsible for the breeding, care and management of livestock. We are producers of a commodity which constitutes one of the major food products of the human race, namely meat. Sometimes we devote so much energy to the animals which we have under our guise that we fail to look to the ultimate designation of the products which they produce and consequently do not have a complete picture of the business in which we are engaged. A live - stock man must not only understand the problems of breeding and feeding farm animals but must ever keep a clear picture of the uses to which the products are put and so plan his operations as to provide for the buyer that which is desired by him. Marshall Field once said in addressing a group of his employees that "Right or wrong, the customer is always right". This statement by the great master merchant was based on a life of experience in the mercantile field and certainly should not be overlooked when we are thinking of the business in which we are engaged. It has been said that it is easier to row a boat down the river than up the stream. This we know to be true. Undoubtedly it is better to give people what they want than to try to make them take what they don't want.- Cattlemen producing beef for commercial markets are confronted with the problem of knowing what the trade wants and then endeavor - ing to produce the same upon an efficient basis. The great mass of buyers have been inclined to call for comparatively small cuts of beef. This means carcasses of young animals. The 1400-pound bullock which produced an 800-pound carcass has had his day. At a time when there were fourteen saloons in every block in Chicago, hunks of beef from big steers of this type made ideal roasts for insertion in the free sand - wiches which went out with steins of beer. That day has passed and today the clamor is for the tidy 700-to 900-pound bullock which pro - duces a 400.- to 500-pound carcass. To be sure the east wants a per - centage of heavier carcasses, however, the demand from that quarter is restricted and when there is an oversupply of heavy cattle, there is prone to be a distressed market. Those men who follow the practice of purchasing calves and holding them through the greater part of a year </seg>
            <seg id="p628">REFORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE j before shipping as fat bullocks seem to have found how best to produce choice to prime steers weighing 1100 to 1200 pounds and producing TOO- to SOO-pound carcasses. In August there usually is a supply of three-year-old grass steers carrying a good deal of flesh which can be put in feed lots and in the short span of 60 to 90 days made into a fairly satisfactory grade of beef. This practice seems to have a place and is recommendable. in fact, it offers a chance to make a fairly satisfactory grade of beef. This practice seems to have a place and is recommend - able. in fact, it offers a chance to make a fairly quick turnover and not Infrequently is quite remunerative. ■ ■ ■ ■ As breeders of cattle we hate to admit that there is a place for the dogy steer, however, experience has shown that in the spring | there is usually a shortage of cheap beef. A feeder can buy during the fall an assortment of odd shaped, freak colored, mongrel cattle at a terrific reduction in price and following a comparatively short winter feeding, find a rather healthy market for the bullocks. These little social misfits of the bovine world carry more age than their weight might indicate. In a way they constitute the survival of the fittest. Most of them have not had much of an opportunity. When exposed to an abundance of silage and some concentrated feed they make a sur - prisingly quick about face and when they reach a fair degree of finish they make decent looking specimens and produce carcasses for which there is quite a realiable demand. Such carcasses are usually available from one to two dollars per hundred cheaper than carcasses produced by well bred cattle possessing much more quality. If the trade wants such beef between February and May. it is our task to see that it has . it. In the spring there seemingly are never enough cows to go around. Some means whereby thin heifery cows can be carried through the winter on roughage and sent to market during the March to June period must be worked out. That again is part of our task. Usually cows during this period sell at sufficient premium to justify playing for the market. The producer of cattle should strive to grow the best. In the main this is what he has done and he has accomplished his purpose quite satisfactorily. This is attested by the uniformly high quality to be found in droves of cattle shipped out of the sandhills of Nebraska and other great range producing areas. The man who is running a cow herd should always have as his goal the production of the best. The feeder located in the Corn Belt or tributary thereto finds that his task is to take the cattle which he can procure and try to have them ready at a season when they are most apt to be .welcomed by the packers who are the mouthpieces of the 127 million souls who hang their hats within the boundaries of the United States and call themselves Ameri- </seg>

In other words the packer -will pay a premium for what the housewife insists upon having when she goes to the retail market to buy meat. During recent years heifers have acquired a considerable degree of popularity, especially those which are fattened at light weights. There is an all-year demand for the well finished little heifer weighing arounrt TOO pounds and producing a 400-pound carcass. There is a somewhat less reliable demand for the heifer weighing from 800 to 900 pounds as she not infrequently is a little wasty in the beef and is subject to discrimination. Heifers which are known to be surplus and which cannot be retained for breeding purposes should go to the feed lot at a comparatively young age. If purchased at weaning time they can be carried through the first winter on silage hay and cake and made ready for a midsummer market by feeding rather liberally on grain for 60 to 90 days or they can be put on a full feed of grain at weaning time and made into creditable beef in from 5 to 7 months. The Nebraska Experiment Station has done considerable work in the fattening of heifers and steers. We have found consistently that heifers do not gain as rapidly as steers but that a larger percentage of the increased weight on heifers consists of fat. In other words, they are ready for the butcher sooner than steers of similar age. Steers are rather prone to grow and it is difficult to put a high degree of finish on a steer under 900 pounds live weight. Usually a heifer of similar age, breeding, and feeding to a steer will posses a comparable finish at from 100 to 150 pounds lighter weight. Prior to a quarter of a century ago most of the sheep which went to market were yearling and two-year-old wethers, supplemented by old ewes. There was considerable objection to mutton produced by these animals. The American housewife found that her family don't care for it. consequently she refuses to buy. Sheepmen soon learned that the people who objected to mutton could easily acquire a fondness for lamb. As a result during recent years the range sheep business has been placed on a 100 per cent lamb production basis. Lamb is about as much of a delicacy with many people as fried chicken. The big old ewes that must go to market are worked off into a class of trade, which through familiarization with the class of meat produced by the same kind of animals in their native lands of Europe, has developed an appreciation for the products. As long as these old sisters are sold for what they are. they do no particular harm and those who have a yearning for lamb experience an increased fondness for the same. In the United States the per capita lamb consumption approximates 7 pounds. We are one of the low nations of the world in this respect. In many the consumption is vastly larger. One of our tasks is to con - tinue developing an appreciation for lamb and work toward an increased consumption. </seg>

            <seg id="p632">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Pork always lias been classed as the poor man's meat. Usually it is the most reasonable which we can procure. It is popular with most people. Fortunately practically all pork is tender. This may account for part of its popularity when compared to beef where the occasional injection of a steak from an old cow that has roamed the ranges for a decade causes a dissatisfied customer, who in the end winds up with the resolution that he will buy no more beef. During the past year pork has been very high. It has really been the highest meat offered by the retailer. Prior to this period of high prices, pork sold dreadfully low. I recently noted some price lists of Lincoln retailers in December 1933 and am reminded of the time when pork chops retailed 3 pounds for a quarter, lard 6 pounds for a quarter and other pork products on about the same basis. During that period prices were too low, far below the cost of production. At this time pork is a little too high. There is a limit to the purchasing power of our patrons. One of our tasks is that of getting the meats which we produce to the average customer at a price which he or she can afford to pay. All of us would be better off if the price level might be stabilized. I realize that this would be a very impractical thing to do and that it probably will never occur. Nevertheless, if a price range could be established which would permit the grower and the fattener of the animal to have a fair return and at the same time permit the meat to be sold to the consumer at a price which he can afford to pay, we would do a good turn for every person affiliated with the industry. These dreadfully high markets, alternated by periods of abnormally low prices, cause grief to grower, feeder, railroad, packer, retailer and customer. Fortunately no synthetic product has yet been produced by the scientist to take the place of meat. I doubt if one will ever be forth - coming. Again, we are fortunate in that we produce products which have a taste with an appeal. Our customers like what we have to offer, therefore, I believe we are in a business which is fundamentally sound and one which will play an important part in the further development of this nation. </seg>
            <seg id="p633">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AXD FEEDERS ASSOCIATION' A FARM FliOCK SURVEY CHARLES ROCHFORD During the last two months, I have been traveling over the eastern half of Nebraska talking with the owners of farm flocks of sheep. Rather than try to give you a summary of the survey I will tell you of some of my personal observations and experiences over and above the survey which we are carrying on. One of the most striking features of my talks with farmers is that nearly all of them said that sheep had made them money during the past depression years. Some went so far as to say that sheep were the most profitable livestock they had kept in recent years. If that is true, then why aren't there more sheep on Nebraska farms? My curiosity became aroused and I decided to see if I could find out why there were so few farm flocks in the state. From what I have learned in my contacts with county agents and farmers I would say there were several factors which tend to hold down the number of sheep on Nebraska farms. In the first place there is an old prejudice against sheep which has carried over from the time of the sheep and cattle wars over the range. A more potent factor is the fact that sheep are just a little different than any other livestock and so must be handled in their own particular way for success. A man •can be a very good cattlemen and be able to raise hogs with great success and yet be a failure with a band of sheep until he gains a little experi - ence in their management problems. As a result of this difference many men have gone into the sheep business and been very unsuccess - ful. Because of their lack of experience and knowledge in handling sheep they get off to a bad start in selecting poor stock and then lose many during the winter, have bad luck at lambing time and do not break even on the sheep for the year's operations. As a result these men are badly discouraged with sheep and proceed to discourage their neighbors also. Right along with lack of experience we find that many places are not properly equipped for sheep. If sheep are to clean up the after - math in stubbles and stalks and take advantage of all pasture available the farm must be fairly well fenced. It takes much tighter fence for sheep than it does for cattle and many tenant places do not have suffici - ently good fence to enable the farmer to keep sheep even if he does want to. Of course there must also be shelter especially at lambing time but this is not so much of a factor. Right along with that is the disadvantage of the sheep man who is alone in a community. Where only one man in a whole community keeps sheep he is much more likely to have trouble with sheep killing dogs because he </seg>
            <seg id="p634">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE will have to combat the problem alone. Obviously his neighbors who have no sheep will not be much interested in how much their own dogs or anybody else's dogs roam the country and so he must light them alone. Where there is only one man in a community with a few sheep he often times has difficulty attracting a shearer in to shear them and they run on into the summer without being shorn or the owner must take time off from his farm work to do it himself. Marketing is also frequently a problem with a man who only has a few sheep and has no neighbors who have lambs ready to go on the market when his are ready. This results in too heavy a lamb which is not a market topper. So much for the reasons we have so few farm flocks in Nebraska. It has been my observation that most of the spread of farm flocks of sheep in this state, or at least in the counties I have visited, has been done in a large part by a few sheep minded individuals. In nearly every community where there is any number of farm flocks I have usually found some one man who has been raising sheep quite a long time and it has been through his experience and guidance that the others have entered into the sheep business. In some cases this man is in the purebred business and perhaps has seen a greater market for his breeding stock by encouraging his neighbors to raise sheep. Others are only commercial lamb raisers and have passed on their experience to farm flock beginners helping them to get started on the right foot. Of course there are other factors which have aided in the increase of farm flocks but I do not feel that they have had the influence that a relatively small number of sheep minded men have had. As Mr. Alexander has mentioned, only about seventy-two per cent of the native Nebraska lambs that go to market are good enough to top the market for the day. If the other twenty-eight per cent is to be brought up to this standard there are several better practices which many Nebraska farm flock owners should adopt. One of these is the use of a good purebred ram regardless of the kind of ewe stock they are using. A farmer may start a flock with a very cheap bunch of ewes but it will not take him long to improve his ewe flock a great deal if he consistently uses a purebred buck. At present it is sometimes hard for a small flock owner to find a good ram and the result is he picks up anything that he can get cheaply while for just a few more dollars he could have had a much better ram which would have added a great deal to the value of his lambs. Right along with this is the matter of when to breed or rather when to lamb. There are really only two distanct methods or types of lamb production. One is the practice of lambing early, self-feeding the lambs and getting them on the market either for Easter or at least by the first of June. The other method is that of lambing late and taking </seg>
            <seg id="p635">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION* advantage of the warm weather and the good spring pasture for putting fast economical gain on the lambs and then selling them as grass fat lambs or feeding them for a time before marketing. Too many farmers do not follow either method but allow the ram to run with the ewes the year around and as a result have lambs dropped from the middle of winter to early summer. Obviously it is much harder to give a bunch of lambs of mixed age the right kind of care and the result is that when the farmer markets he has some runts, some not docked or castrated, one end of the bunch being too heavy, the latter ones being too light. The result is that the average lamb raiser has only about seventy per cent market toppers and the rest bring him a lower price because he has neglected a few little details of proper management. During the first part of the survey I found very few farmers who dipped their sheep and most of them said they had no need to dip as they had very few ticks and those they did have did npt do any damage. As a matter of fact they very nearly had me believing that they did not need to dip. However, when I got up into the vicinity of Carroll, Nebraska I found a group of farmers who had been dipping their sheep for the last two years and I found them very enthusiastic about the practice. Since these men have rid their flocks of ticks they have noticed so much improvement that they wonder how they ever got along without doing it before. The ewes are more thrifty and do better and are not rubbing off their wool as they formerly did. Another practice which has been neglected on most farms is that of drenching for stomach worms. Most farmers do not realize what a menace this parastite is. They do not realize that sheep which are run on the same ground for long periods year after year are almost certain to be wormy. Although the farmer does not know his lambs have stomach worms, the feeder buyers, from past experience, know they are present in native lambs and as a result will not bid up as high . for thin native lambs to feed as they will for thin western lambs which are almost certain to be free of the parasite. Although I feel there is a place on most farms for a farm flock of sheep, I would not advise any one to jump into the business without some experience with a few ewes or at least some background of prac - tical information. I do feel that the farmer who starts in slowly and builds up both numbers and quality to fit his own individual farm set-up and uses good practical management in handling his flock is almost certain to have reasonably good success with sheep. </seg>
            <seg id="p636">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE A PROFITABLE SIDELINE K. C. FOUTS The recent upturn in the fat lamb market has restored a good deal of long suffering confidence in sheep raising on the Nebraska general ' . farm. It is some additional satisfaction that the restoration of good prices is the result of a stronger demand for both wool and flesh. While we usually think of sheep raising or feeding as a major activity when watching the market, the so-called general farming area of Nebraska doesn't respond to market fluctuations very closely in carrying the farm flock. Our general farms are primarily homes and operations are planned to suit the individual members of the family as well as the particular type of farm operated. There are some rather definite conclusions to be drawn from observ - ing farm flock owners over a period of years. The man who stays by sheep year after year is rather certain to be a man who likes and under - stands his animals. For the man who is indifferent usually runs afoul of some of the rather certain misfortunes to overtake the careless owner of sheep. The man who knows his sheep usually has fences in good repair. He has changes of pasture for his sheep that worms do not catch up with his flock. He has adequate, although not neces - sarily expensive shelter. And he is sure to have a dog-proof, enclosure to which the flock is brought at night so that he as well as the sheep, may rest in comfort. I have observed a number of men go into sheep and for a few years make good returns for the effort expended. Then something goes wrong. Management to prevent worms has been ignored and the flock goes to pieces. And then some morning several sheep, badly torn, are piled up in the fence corner dead, while a few may be scattered about. I can recall several instances where dogs in one night have done much more damage than the cost of an adequate sheep fold let alone a season's profit. Then there is the small flock, too small to command attention. I can see but one advantage in having two or three to ten sheep about. And that is that the growing boy or man may learn to observe the habits of sheep more closely by becoming well acquainted with the sheep as individuals so that they quickly observe any change in the behavior of any one j3heep. In dealing with 4-H club boys, we encourage close observation of the few individuals that all phases of sheep behavior may be quickly recognized and properly understood. With the habit well established of detecting anything wrong with a single individual, the foundation is laid for the making of a careful shepherd of a large flock. Outside of this, the small flock is a nuisance. Then we find a too common attitude that a small flock of sheep can </seg>
            <seg id="p637">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION' be used as scavengers. They are supposed to glean a living from fence rows, the roadside, and about the yards. This sort of flock can usually be identified by long tails, neglected shearing in the spring, and burry, dirty fleeces. This flock usually lasts until the dogs have a night out or until the sheep are included as boot in some trade. After making too many of these observations, the true animal husbandman is not hard to recognize in a single glance at the flock. The farm operated by a family in which a general love and under - standing of livestock is found with sheep having a place in the program, will usually have sheep for years at a stretch. The flock is large enough to command attention, usually 25 to 40 breeding ewes and a good buck at the head of the flock. The ewes have character and evidence of the master's idea of type. Early in the spring the clip is taken from the sheep instead of left hanging on the gates, fences, and shrubbery in bunches. Lambs are docked promptly. Of recent years we have observed a tendency toward early marketing of lambs. As a practice fitting in with the general farm operation, this permits attention when there is not much field work to do and the lambs are gone before the heavy work comes on. I realize the later lambs going to market this past fall proved the better deal but I doubt that it is the better practice in the long run. The two crop plan, wool and lambs, makes the income from the farm flock attractive. With early lambs and the usual shearing, some income is received at a time of the year when there is not ordinarily much to sell. Make this ewe and lamb program a part of the farm business. Some would call it a sideline. The nuisance flock may be a sideline but the farm flock that is a full unit of 25 to 40 in size, be - comes a worth-while part of the farm business offering pay for work at a time when time and effort cannot be turned so readily into cash on other farm activities. Now we are hearing a great deal about land utilization.. I do not believe many folks will deny that much of our Nebraska land needs a change in management. The farm flock certainly fits into a program of land retirement. Increased interest in the farm flock may well go hand in hand with the movement for improvement of Nebraska pas - tures. Our economists tell us that the farm is today the greatest stronghold of that necessary unit of society — the home. The farm flock, in its requirements of food, shelter and understanding care may be emblematical in that the flock master in his work finds a parallel to the true spirit of home. </seg>
            <seg id="p638">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE FARM FLOCKS I HAVE SEEN D. D. WAINSCOTT Although Cass county is not outstanding as a sheep producing county, it does have some very good farm flocks, some of which are pure - bred Shropshires and Oxfords. I believe much of this development in the farm flock situation has been due to our County Fair. We usually have about sixty entries. The fair provides a good place for the sale of rams which our purebred breeders bring into the fair where anyone interested in buying can get a look at the best bucks raised in the county. Last year at the fair I was talking to a man who had ten or twelve bucks for sale when a farmer walked up and said he wanted to buy one. The owner told him the price and invited him to take his pick of the bunch. The farmer looked them all over and picked out the one with the least quality, longest legs, and not much of any - thing good about him and said that was the one he wanted. After the purchaser went away I remarked to the owner of the bucks that the farmer certainly did a poor job of picking a choice out of the bunch. The owner replied that this particular man always did, and that he was his best market for the tail end of his ram stock. It seems to me that the difference between success and failure with sheep lies in doing a few little things at the right time. Some success - ful sheep men that I have observed are very careful to select a good buck of the type they want. I think this is a point on which much good can be done in teaching the essentials of good type, quality, and character. The more successful men I have observed usually flush their ewes on a good patch of rye pasture and also paint the brisket of the buck when he is turned in with the ewes so that they know when the ewes will lamb and which are the barren ewes. Another prac - tice of our better farm flock owners is the feeding of silage during the winter months. Their sheep seem to be more thrifty and do better on this feed which is very economical to feed. Many farmers fail at lambing time. The man who saves all of his lambs is the one who comes out better in the end. Exercise is very important and the man who feeds his ewes a quarter of a mile away from the place on a hill and does not feed them too much corn will have much less trouble at lambing time and come through with a larger percentage of lambs saved. Some of our farmers lamb early and then self-feed their lambs for an early market while others lamb late in the spring, pasture the lambs through the summer, and then fatten them in the cornfield in the fall. I've had a good many discussions with farmers about the merits of lambing early and late and perhaps I am wrong but it is </seg>
            <seg id="p639">-NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION my belief that by lambing early they get a better price for their lambs and In addition do not have to pasture the lambs through the summer and take the chance of their getting worms. I am firmly convinced that there is a place on many farms for a small flock of sheep and I make the prediction that it won't be many years till we will see a considerable increase in farm flocks of sheep. HOUSE BREEDING PROBLEMS W. W. DERRICK The horse breeding problem is really quite an important one Now that there is a very good demand for horses and they are bringing good prices many men want to get back into the horse breeding business As the saying goes, they want to get in while the stream flows fast. For a good many years there was very little interest in horses and their numbers declined rather rapidly. Since horse prices have taken such a change, the situation is entirely different. Price has given it a different complexion. Assessors' reports for the year April 1 1934 to April 1J 1935 show that horses three years and over declined 'o 7% hones two years and under increased 13%, whjle yearlings increased A\%. This change of complexion in the horse situation has made a great difference in the stallion population. It is much more concen - trated and stallions more available than they have been for quite some time. We used to have men bring mares in seventy-five miles to get them bred. One man brought mares from across the Kansas line for several years because he said there was no good stallion any closer than ours here at the college. When prices got so low farmers just quit breeding their mares and the stallion owner went out of business. Just here the other day I went out in the country with a fellow and he bought a pair of fillies and paid four hundred dollars for the pair That is a good price for horses but there always have been high prices paid for good horses. Of course there were a good many horses that won t bring much of a price but they could hardly be called horses Here the other day a chap came along and I took him down to the horse barn and showed him around and he asked me what I would take for a twelve-day old colt we had, I didn't want to sell the colt so I priced him at two hundred dollars. And just that quick he said "Sold, and if this mare has a fllly next year, I give you two hundred fifty for it when it is nine days old." With prices like these many farmers don't have money to buy horses and they are going to get along the best way they can with what they have. </seg>
            <seg id="p640">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE We get a lot of letters here asking about the different breeds and one thing and another. My advice is to get the breed you like and the one that fits best into your farm program. About this matter of color, I would just like to tell you what Mr. Duncan Marshall said about color when he was here the last time. Mr. Marshall said, "A good bull is always the right color." And that is just about right although I find the blacks and grays the hardest to sell. There just doesn't seem to be the demand for them that there is for the other colors. I find that jacks are very scarce and it wasn't so long ago that you could hardly give them away. There have been some importations of jacks from Spain. Maybe some of you read of a shipment that just came over a short time ago. Regardless of what breed you raise or whether you raise horses or mules, breed them right and then use them to get the most horse power you can. And by that I mean the big hitch. That is the multiple hitch. You get away from the side draft, it works so much nicer, and is so much easier on the horses. I know you will like it. We hear a lot about planned use and the return to more pasture and roughage being used on the farm to prevent erosion and maintain the soil fertility. This new program fits right in with the use of horses on the farm. Raise your own pasture, raise your own roughage and feed it to the horses and you won't have to pay out the cash for power. There is just one last thing I want to mention and that is parasites in horses. Particularly the bot fly. For the past several years the bot fly has been playing hob with our horses. Not only are they a terrible nuisance in the field but they sap the very life out of the horse when he becomes heavily infested. The time to treat horses for bots is right now. Keep the horse off feed and dose him and you'll get rid of the bots in his stomach and you won't have the flies next summer. A TEN MHjIiION DOIiliAR LOSS DR. W. T. SPENCER The topic assigned to me by the Program Committee, "A Ten Million Dollar Loss" refers to the annual loss to the industry from deads, crippled, and bruised animals, during the process of marketing. This amount was taken from a report of losses for the year 1933. On present market values of livestock, these figures would be much larger, perhaps fifteen million dollars would be a conservative estimate. This </seg>
            <seg id="p641">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION is not a new problem. Various committees representing livestock marketing agencies, transportation companies, and meat packers, have been for a number of years actively working to redxice this loss. Much effective work has been done. In order to better coordinate these various activities, there was organized in 1934 a National Live Stock Loss Prevention Board. This board is made up of representatives of producers, shippers, livestock exchanges, meat packers, and transportation companies. The object of the organization is to initiate and encourage education and research, to correlate and coordinate present activities and information, to secure new data, to disseminate correct information and to promote practical and proper methods of reducing and eliminating preventable livestock losses during the marketing process. Mr. H. R. Smith of Chicago, a former Nebraskan, and at one time head of the Animal Husbandry de - partment of this college, is the manager of this board. Regional man - agers are located at the principal midwestern livestock markets. Most of you here are familiar in a general way with losses incident to production of livestock. This production loss in most cases is in young animals in which comparatively little expense has been in - volved, but losses in transit are mostly the finished animals which represent a heavy expense in feed and labor. This loss in transit, a great deal of which is a hidden loss from injured and bruised animals, is not generally known to the public — it amounts in the aggregate to four million pounds of beef and five million pounds of pork that is totally condemned annually in United States inspected plants as an inedible product and may be used only for tankage. This meat for tank - age is worth about a quarter of a cent per pound. In addition to this nine million pounds of condemned meat, there is two and a half-million pounds of beef, and five million pounds of pork, that must be trimmed from around these bruises and may be converted into hamburger and sausages' at a substantial reduction in values. In order to acquaint the public with this condition, bruised meat exhibits were displayed at Organized Agriculture last year, at the Iowa and Nebraska State Fairs, at the Ak-Sar-Ben Livestock Show, and in the lobby of the Livestock Exchange Building at Omaha during the year. I am sure that these exhibits we're helpful in acquainting the producers and shippers with this loss. Following the meeting at Omaha, Mr. Banning, secretary of the Department of Agriculture for Nebraska, wrote me in part as follows: "Truckers, as we know, and also a great many farmers, are in - clined to treat an unruly animal rather roughly when loading. I know that I, myself, have to plead guilty in the past to the same thing. It is perhaps that this came from the reason that I did not </seg>
            <seg id="p642">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE understand the great losses that occurred from handling stock in this manner." Like expressions were made by many who viewed these exhibits. During the time that this Board has been functioning, a great deal of statistical information has been gathered as to the amount of loss from deads, crippled, and injured animals, and the cause. Information has been obtained from packers on specific shipments where extensive bruises were found after slaughter and where ownership could be de - termined. These reports have been followed up with a personal letter to the owners or shippers advising them of the condition of the animals upon slaughter, and asking for any information that could be given that would help to locate the cause and place the responsibility for these bruises. The information collected indicates that the bruising occurs all along the route, from the loading at farms to the killing floors of the packing houses. Rough treatment by kicking, blows from clubs, whips, etc., while loading and unloading, and slamming of gates against the animals when cutting and sorting are causes of most of the bruises. Many of these bruises apparently of long standing in - tiicate that a great deal of it occurs at the time of loading on trucks at the farms. Losses in transit from deads and cripples is now around three million dollars a year. These figures are far below what they were five years ago. The railroads have been giving much attention to improving methods of handling livestock in transit. It used to be a common practice to feed heavily just before loading livestock destined to market. This caused, in many cases, excessive losses. Overloading also was responsible for heavy death losses and excessive shrinkage, sometimes amounting to two or three hundred pounds per car of hogs. Information has been given by the livestock agents of the railroads to shippers how to prepare animals for shipment, and instructions issued to railroad employees that careful inspection of cars and loading chutes be frequently made and faulty equipment that would be apt to result in injury to the animals be taken care of properly. Station agents and other employees have been instructed to see that proper bedding with material suitable for prevailing weather conditions is supplied. A bedding of one inch of sand in summer time has proven to be one of the best methods of bedding cars for livestock shipment. In the winter time, a thin layer of sand over the bottom of the car to which is added two or three bales of straw makes a good cold weather bedding. In extreme cold weather, several railroads have recommended papering the stock cars with a tar or building paper up as high as the animals in the car. This is done to prevent the cold drafts from chilling the animals excessively. During hot weather, at frequent intervals, hog shipments by rail are sprinkled with water. This has been found very effective in preventing death losses. </seg>
            <seg id="p643">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION More than one-half the animals received at the public markets today are brought in by truck. The records available indicate that a considerable larger percent of the injured animals received at the market centers are animals that have been trucked in. Investigations at the unloading docks found that the trucks hauling livestock were not standard in body height. The truck floors, in many cases, were not in line: with the unloading docks. The livestock unloaded over such docks had to, be pulled up over the end gates or were required to jump down ;onto the loading docks, depending upon whether the truck body was above or below the loading dock. This was found to be re - sponsible for many injuries and bruises. Mixed shipments of animals in trucks without partitions is perhaps the cause for more deads and injured animals than any other one thing. An example is a letter just received a short time ago from Mr. Ed. Kunkel, head hog buyer for the Cudahy Packing Company of Omaha, in 'vhich he writes as follows: "Oni! of the boys in my department observed a consignment arriving at the unloading chute this morning which is an example of the damage resulting from mixed shipments by truck. "The shipment consisted of 5 cattle, 4 calves, 1 hog, and 3 sheep. On arrival, the shipment contained 1 crippled steer, 1 crippled can - ner cowl, 1 lamb crippled and the hog was dead. A wild steer tied at one end probably did most of the damage." This is a typical report of many such cases as are received almost daily at any livestock market. Investigations have demonstrated the lack of proper facilities on farms for loading livestock. A drawing for a practical, adjustable, portable, loading chute for farm purposes has been prepared and made available for distribution. The men handling livestock on the public markets have recognized for many years the. importance of careful handling of livestock. The drivers and handlers of livestock on the public markets employed by commission! men and stock yard companies are men of experience and are required by strict rules of the companies to treat and handle live - stock humanely and carefully. At frequent intervals, information is passed along to these men about this loss, to keep them mindful of their responsibility in this problem. This loss is a heavy tax upon the industry and one that can be greatly reduced if all agencies concerned in the marketing and processing of livestock will see to it that all animals in their care are handled properly and carefully. </seg>
            <seg id="p644">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE EFFICIENT HOG PRODUCTION WM. J. LOEFFEL The topic which has been assigned me is susceptible of a number of interpretations. We might launch into the discussion of the use of protein supplements or into a discussion of ways and means of eliminating the losses in shipping which Dr. Spencer has just mentioned. I have chosen to assume an entirely different tack however. The Minnesota Experiment Station has recently issued a bulletin (No. 320) entitled "A Six Years Study of Crossbreeding Swine". This bulletin has brought forth some very heated discussions and I can think of nothing which would probably create more interest at the meeting today than to review briefly the results reported in this publication. For years livestock producers have recognized that by crossing separate breeds that a certain amount of stimulation or "hybrid vigor" is imparted to the first cross. We have consistently told producers, "cross breeds for market if you want to but sell all of the pigs. Under no circumstances use the crossbred gilts for breeding purposes." The startling thing about the Minnesota experiments is the fact that they tell us that the crossbred gilts can efficiently be used for pork produc - tion and in fa&gt;,t that the crossbred gilts are distinctly superior to the original purebred foundation stock. The investigations were carried on over a period of 6 years at 2 of their experimental stations, a total of 1535 pigs having been in - volved. All pigs were fed in an identical manner so that the results are comparable. Three groups of pigs were produced. First as a basis of comparison there were the purebreds which were used as founda - tion stock, next was a group of pigs resulting as the first cross between two purebreeds, secondly there was a group of pigs designated as the 3-breed cross. Let us suppose that a Poland China boar were mated with Duroc Jersey sows and the resultant gilts mated with a Chester White boar. This would give us a 3-breed cross. The last group was' known as the backcross pigs. Let us suppose that a Poland China boar were mated with Duroc Jersey gilts and the resultant pigs mated back to a Duroc Jersey board. All three hybrid groups were superior to comparable purebreds. The first cross and backcross groups were approximately equal in superiority to the purebreds but both were excelled by the 3-breed cross. The crossbred sows were superior to purebreds for producing pigs. </seg>
            <seg id="p645">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION The resulting pigs benefited as much from being out of crossbred sows as they did from being crossbred themselves. The three items of comparison that are of most concern to the com - mercial swine producer are: The increased litter size and weight at weaning, the decreased time necessary to reach market weight, and the decreased feed necessary for a pound of gain. The crossbred litters averaged from % pig to *&amp; pig larger at weaning; on the average, each pig weighed from 5 to 7 pounds more at weaning and the litters weighed from 39 to 96 pounds more than the purebreds. The crossbred pigs reached market weight of 220 pounds from 17 to 22 days earlier than comparable purebreds, and they reached that weight on from 27 to 36 fewer pounds of grain. • I ■"■' : •■■■■■■ THE DUAL-PURPOSE COAV AND THE DISTRIBUTION OP FARM CAPITAL A. "W. MEDLAR There are two bases on which we may develop a dual-purpose cow. Either base may be a good sound economic plan and may be profitable to any individual farmer. The one plan is to develop a breed of cattle which under general farm conditions and care will give a moderate amount of butterfat and also produce calves of good market quality. There are already such cattle developed and so far as we are able to judge the farmers who own them are doing about as well as any other farmers in their community. The second plan is one of breeding and management. It consists of the selection of good milk cows and the mating of them to good beef sires. This second plan is not in general thought of as using dual-purpose cattle. There has been but little work done along this line, but some good results have been obtained. The milk cow must not be too sensitive so as to require special care, and the sire must be one which is propotent in color and conformation. Instead of having to maintain separate herds to keep up such a plan it is only necessary to use the surpluses from beef and dairy herds. I know there are some places where this would not be popular and there are areas in the state where it should not be tolerated. It would be inexcusable to follow such a plan in the sand hill, beef region or within the dairy areas near the larger </seg>
            <seg id="p646">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE towns and the cities more than to a limited degree. There are, how - ever, hundreds of farms in the state where the income from the farm would be materially increased by such a practice. For results possible on fat cattle prices I refer you to work done at the Sni-a-bar ranch. In Nebraska farmers have not yet reached the state where it pays to cultivate soil intensively. They have not yet accumulated sufficient capital so that interest rates have dropped too low. Labor is their most important factor in production. Therefore, farmers are always planning how to make a small investment and then secure a reasonable return from the enterprise. The labor returns may be low per hour. But the use of their labor on the enterprise brings in a considerable income through the year. The milk cows on the average Nebraska farm is a good example. She isn't worth very much — from $20.00 to $45.00. The average farm can carry five or six head of tolerably good cows on an investment of $150 to $300. These cows eat but little saleable feed. They utilize but little labor at a time when the main enterprises of the farm require labor. It requires a very small investment for shelter or for storage of their feed. They readily replace themselves for the heifers can be fed on the same class of cheap feed which the cows use. There are many years when damaged grain or hay can be utilized only by this class of livestock. The year 1934 was a trying year for most crop farmers. It put most farmers to the test of their ability to figure a way out of a difficult financial situation. Farm account books from five Nebraska counties furnish a good study on the milk cow situation. There a total of 167 farm reports in these five counties. The following figures show the number of farms, the investment per farm in all cattle, the total dairy sales, and dairy sales per cow.

            <seg id="p647">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION It will be noticed that, based on the total Investment in cattle, farmers receive as income from 30 per cent to 60 per cent annually. This may seem like a high rate of income, but we must remember that it represents not only capital income but labor and by-products as well. The point which should be emphasized is that by making an invest - ment the farmer utilizes what would probably have been wasted and has an income equal to from one-third to two-thirds as large as his investment. Another phase of this problem may be shown by comparing the investment in cattle with the income from cattle. This study should be based on only livestock investments and income.

The figures show that from 36 per cent to 47 per cent of the livestock investment is in cattle and that about 36 per cent of the income from livestock came from the cattle. The figures further show that when the dairy sales and the sales of young stock are both considered it often happens as in Hamilton county farmers receive as income 98 per cent of their investment. They received 90 per cent in Clay and approximately 70 per cent in Perkins. I believe it is fair to say these farmers in the main are using cattle as dual-pur - pose animals. They do not produce a very good feeder calf nor very much butterfat per cow. It might be pertinent to add another one of my beliefs, namely that farmers might add from $2.00 to $8.00 per cow or from $15 to $50 per farm by using a good type of beef bull. The last phase of this problem which will be presented is a study of individual farms in Hamilton county. Twenty farms were selected and divided equally into farms having eight milk cows or less and those having nine or more. The table is shown to call attention to the rela - tion between investment and income per milk cow. Cows were low priced in the spring of 1934 and butterfat prices ranged from about 16 to 24 cents per farm. There is one farm in each group which sold fluid milk and this will account for the very high income per cow on these farms. </seg>

The income for butterfat ranged from $26 to $79 per cow and the one farm selling fluid milk received $102 per cow. Remember these are only dairy sales and do not include the calf sales. It is evident that the farmer who valued cows at $31, each, and re - ceived $102 income from each priced his cows too low. On the other hand the farmer who valued cows at $40 and received only $26 income had priced his too high unless he produced unusually good calves. In the second group cows per farm ranged from 9 to 20. Their value ranged from $20 to $65 and the income from 21 to 66 for butterfat and 127 for fluid milk. Here again we find some difference in the farmer's estimate of the value of his cows. The farmer selling fluid milk had probably given more thought to his problem. He priced his cows the highest of all and received the highest return per cow. His cows were priced at three times the value of the lowest and his income </seg>
            <seg id="p649">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION was two times as much as the income from the lowest. But there was another herd which was priced at one-third the value and yielded only one-sixth as much income. In both groups there are numerous herds which yielded 100 per cent on the investment. In fact there are only two cases which fell below that standard. FEED UTILIZATION WITH GENERAL PURPOSE CATTLE E. M. BROtTSE Before going into the discussion of feed utilization with general purpose cattle, may I give my idea of a general purpose cow. I have been told by the dairyman and the beef-cattle man that there is no such animal. For them there is not because they are specialists and should have a cow bred for their special purpose. The high producing dairy cow is of little value to the man not adapted to dairying. For him the general purpose cow better fits his needs. This cow is one capable of producing five or six thousand pounds of milk and still furnish a desirable carcus for the block. I am sure that there are general purpose cows but I am not so sure there is a breed of general purpose cattle if we define such a breed as one in which there is a balance between their milking and beef characteristics. The present statis of our so-called general purpose breeds is some - what similar to a see-saw with beef propensity on one end and dairy on the other. A few breeders have obtained a fairly consistant balance between the two characteristics. Coming back to the topic of feed utilization, I find it difficult to discuss without stepping over into the other speakers' territory, bo ask their pardon. At the Valentine Substation, we have done some work with general purpose cattle. In 1925, ten head of grade Shorthorns were purchased from a couple of local farmers. These cows were run in comparison with our purebred Holsteins on a basis of feed utilization for milk production. I am sorry now that comparative data on market value was not also obtained for the cows and their offspring. At the present we are conducting more work with general purpose cattle in which both milk and beef producing qualities are being considered. When we did our first work, the average production of the Hoi- </seg>
            <seg id="p650">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE steins was 12,000 pounds of milk and 455 pounds of butterfat. The average of the Shorthorns was 6465 pounds of milk and 259 pounds of butterfat. The two herds were managed the same and given the same kinds of feed. The grain mixture containing from 14 to 16 per cent protein was fed at the rate of one pound to three of milk. Silage was available for most of the winter periods. The dry roughage consisted of prairie hay and alfalfa. The pasture was sandhill range, which was nothing to brag about as a dairy pasture. Since we wanted a record of all feed, exclusive of pasture, the cattle were not allowed to salvage the ordinary field waste. Up our way, the general purpose cow is perferred to the dairy cow as a field salvager. The farmers say that a Holstein.will starve to death if forced to rustle. Perhaps the cows they have had experience with were on relief before they got them. It did not take our red cows long to discover that there was not any need to leave the barnyard except for a little walk. Where a record was kept of the feed consumed, exclusive of pasture, some interesting data was secured. In general the Holsteins consumed more feed, produced more milk and returned a greater profit above cost of feed on that basis. On a production basis of 455 pounds of fat the Holsteins utilized 9.5 pounds of grain, 11.9 pounds of hay, and 11.8 pounds of silage to produce one pound of fat. The Shorthorns on a 250 pounds fat basis utilized 9.1 pounds of grain, 15.8 pounds of hay, and 15.8 pounds of silage for each pound of fat. Figuring grain at $1.50 per cwt. hay at $6.00 per ton and silage at $5.00 the feed cost, exclusive of pasture, for the Holsteins would be 20.1 cents per pound of fat and for the Shorthorns 21.4 cents. That is not such a bad showing for the red cows when compared with high producing Holsteins. My next thought was what the com - parative feed utilization would be were the fat production about equal. The data for the five highest producing Shorthorns averaging 319 pounds of fat showed a requirement of 8.4 pounds of grain, 16.6 pounds of hay, and 14.7 pounds of silage, which figured at the above prices would cost 20.5 cents per pound of fat. I also went back in our Holstein records when our herd average was below 300 pounds of fat. A three year average showed that 9.3 pounds of grain. 13 pounds of hay, and 20.9 pounds of silage was utilized in producing one pound of fat, the cost of which would be 21.9 cents. </seg>
            <seg id="p651">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION While this data covers an average of several years there are some factors such as time of freshening, supply of silage, and pasture con - dition which affect the feed consumption. In the utilization of feed from a butterfat standpoint there was but little difference between the breeds if production was about the same. The Holstein, however, did make a more economical use of their feed in producing 100 pounds of milk. With the 12,000 pound aver - age for Holsteins and 6465 for the Shorthorns, the difference was around 10 cents per hundred. Where the volume of milk was about the same the difference in cost was only a few cents in favor of the Holsteins. Their chief advantage is in their volume of output. Last July we took over a herd of Red Polls that the U. S. D. A. had at Ardmore, South Dakota. At present it appears that only a few head will measure up to our 6000 pound production goal. We still have four Holsteins at the Station and have been making some comparisons on feed utilization. We had good range this fall and did not feed anything except grain until about the middle of October when silage was added. By Novem - ber they had practically stopped grazing and were consuming around 60 pounds of silage per day. Up until the 21st of December silage was the only roughage fed. The Holstein's were eating 67.2 pounds per day and Red's 68 pounds in December. The feed utilization during November was 11.9 pounds grain and 69.3 pounds silage for pound of fat for three Holsteins and 9.1 pounds grain and 71 pounds of silage for the three best Red Polls. The aver - age production of fat was about the same. Due to the short time this test has been under way we cannot draw definite comparisons. As a result of all of our work it is my opinion that unless a farmer is a dairyman and has a dairy herd averaging 400 pounds or more, he would probably be better off with a general purpose herd. SOME PRODUCTION" PROBLEMS WITH DUAL-PURPOSE CATTLE PROF. P. A. DO'WNS Questions connected with dual-purpose cattle should be of much interest to the average western farmer. The question of the value of </seg>
            <seg id="p652">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE dual-purpose cattle has been discussed pro and con by both the beef cattle people and the dairymen and is often looked upon with disfavor by both groups. I wonder sometimes if much of the discussion is not carried on without a clear conception of just what is meant by the term "dual-purpose cattle". ' According to Webster, the word "dual" means two-fold or double, while the word "purpose" means, the object, effect or result aimed at, intended or attained. In light of our present division of the cattle busi - ness, that is, the Beef Industry on one side and the Dairy Industry on the other, the term would mean cattle that both produce beef and also give milk, but it fails, however, to define the degree of perfection in either case. As the degree of perfection is approached in either di - rection one might say that an animal either becomes a beef animal or becomes a dairy animal. One might argue that there is no such thing as a dual-purpose animal. That an animal that is being milked is a dairy cow, but when it is fed and fattened it is a beef animal. In other words, the inter - pretation of the term "dual-purpose cattle" depends on the person dis - cussing the situation. It is very evident that through the hundreds of years that cattle have been bred and selected, certain groups of people have selected for certain characterists. In the case of beef, the cow has in some cases been selected to the point of a high degree of perfection in re - gard to production of beef and the production of a similar type calf. Often in these cases the cow has lost her ability to produce enough milk to raise her calf satisfactorily. On the other hand, the dairy cow has been bred to produce much more milk than is necessary for her calf, but does not have a carcass that is readily fitted for market. The dual-purpose animal, in my mind, is the animal that has not been developed to either extreme, but rather rests at a happy medium between the two. In my own mind, I sometimes wonder if we have not gone too far both in the development of beef types as well as dairy types. For instance, how long would the extreme type of beef cow reproduce and perpetuate herself if she did not produce enough milk for her calf. The extreme type is the creation of man and must be maintained by man. It is not a natural situation and seems to me would tend to revert to the normal if nature was allowed to take its course. In the case of the dairy cow, the carrying of a calf and the produc - tion of large quantities ot milk takes vast amounts of food material out of the body of the cow. She must eat large amounts of food and after she is not able to maintain the proper balance of nutrients so that a normal reproduction is maintained. Her vitality becomes lowered </seg>
            <seg id="p653">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION' and she is subject to disease. In this way nature here again has a tendency to step in and hold man from going too far in this idea of excessive production. As I said before, is it not possible that we have gone too far and lost sight of the fact that what we need both in the case of beef as well as dairy cattle is economical production and a perpetuation of an economical animal from one generation to the next. Just what kind of an animal this should be is difficult to say as it depends upon the point of view. From the standpoint of the beef man, one might say that the ideal cow is one that is a good beef animal and also gives plenty of milk to feed the calf. A dairyman might say that it is a cow that gives plenty of milk and at the same time would be satisfactory for beef. Those interested in the development of an animal that approaches the ideal beef and dairy cow combined have had their eyes upon the animal that evidently we refer to today as the dual-purpose cow. It is very evident that there ate certain limits that accompany this group of cattle because if you get too far in either direction one gets out of the dual-purpose idea and becomes either beef or dairy. But when all is said and done, the majority of cattle in our state do not meet the ideals of either group of cattle. The average beef cow does raise a calf and many give more milk than is required for that purpose. This is shown by the large amount of cream that is produced each year in our state. It is not produced by cows bred to produce milk, but rather beef cows that produce much milk. In terms of the dairyman one might call them low producing dairy cows. The census figures of 1930 show 3,151,987 total cattle in the state, 621,456 cows and heifers milked in 1929; 316,319 beef and dual-purpose cattle. At any rate cream is produced and in the end, we eat the carcass. They may not have been an ideal animal and you can call them what you will as far as name is concerned, but they have served a dual- or general-purpose. Animals that can produce a calf, give more milk than is necessary, and at the same time have a carcass that can be used for beef is surely an economical animal in the long run. That being the case, is it not possible that more thought and attention should be given to the selection of this type of animal in our state? In the generations to come our farmers are going to be called upon to produce economically. We have vast acres for cattle, plenty of feed in normal years and will no doubt always be a large producer of butter - fat. More economical production means greater profit for our farmers. Not in a few herds, but throughout the mass of cattle that are milked throughout the state. Is it not possible that through selection and the use of suitable sires the average production could be materially raised without injuring beef values? </seg>
            <seg id="p654">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Another problem before the farmer who is milking cows is that a good quality product should be marketed. Clean, fresh cream is essential for success In competition with other states. This can easily be obtained by ordinary care. That also presents another problem and that is the system of marketing cream. This, however, will no doubt right itself with more economical production and no doubt will result in either the milking of more cows per farm or at least the production of more fat per farm, and allow some system of frequent delivery to be practiced. Another factor that should also be kept in mind with this type of cattle is that usually animals are kept on the farm for shorter pe - riods than in the case of ideal dairy cattle. This is a material aid in the control of such diseases as abortion and mastitis. Common sense methods of feeding, use of home-grown feeds will do much toward economical production which is in the end the keynote to a successful agriculture. </seg>

            <seg id="p656">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE FEEDING WITH A LEAD PENCIL M. A. ALEXANDER The livestock feeder needs to equip himself for his business just as completely as the surveyor, lawyer, dentist, or any other professional man. The lack of proper equipment is just as ruinous to the livestock feeder as it is to the professional man. - Much of the feeder's equipment can be obtained at practically no immediate cost to him. The Bureau of Agricultural Economics, U. S. Department of Agriculture, issues monthly a bulletin called "The Agricultural Situation". It contains a brief summary of economic con - ditions with special articles on agricultural products. A year's sub - scription is 25 cents. It is a good barometer for the feeder. The same bureau publishes an "Outlook" for each new year. This is usually available the last month of the old year. Feeders have free access to published data from their own state Experiment Stations. These may be data on feeds, ration comparisons, crops, soils, diseases, feed preparation, production, and other subjects all of vital importance to the livestock feeder. Pushing the pencil to accommodate all the available information on the proposition under consideration and to estimate the cost and return of the proposed undertaking will eliminate a great deal of pushing on the fork handle under conditions that are not likely to make the enter - prise a success. FEEDING GRAIN SORGHUMS C. E. AUB.EL Kansas State College In talking with livestock feeders in different parts of the country where they do not raise sorghums, it has been my experience to find that when the name sorghum is mentioned these livestock men in - variably want to know what sort of a feed it is, and so I wonder if I could not best begin my talk by defining the grain sorghums and differentiating between them. Especially, I should like to consider the merits of those sorghums that the feeders in this state are most likely to come into contact with. </seg>
            <seg id="p657">641 NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AXI) FEEDERS ASSOCIATION The most common sorghums are the kafirs, canes, milos, and feteritas. These are not all the sorghums by any means. A complete list of the varieties would run into the scores. As livestock feeders you are unlikely to be interested in near all of them. You will be interested first of all in those that will provide you the best grains and perhaps you will want to know of some that have a good forage value. As far as the livestock feeder is concerned, the sorghums are divided into two groups. First, those known as forage sorghums, and second, those known as grain sorghums. The first group is made up mostly of the so-called canes. There are many of these, the most common of which are Kansas Orange, Black Amber, and Sumac. They are dif - ferentiated from the sorghums in the second group in that they have tall stalks with an abundance of sweet juice. The yield of seed, how - ever, is low and it is generally bitter and unpalatable. Consequently the canes offer little in the way of a grain feed. They do, however, furnish excellent roughage for silage or dry fodder. The second group, or grain sorghums, are the ones that are of inter - est to the livestock man. This group comprises the kafirs, the most common varieties of which are the Blackhull, Pink, and Red. Kalo is a hybrid derivative. The varieties in this group are noted for their short, thick stalk, broad leaves. They are more or less juicy and sweet and the most important thing of all they have a heavy yield of palatable seed. A variety of sorghum of much importance and one that is well known is Atlas. This sorghum is a cross between the forage and the grain sorghums, namely Blackhull kaflr and Soulless cane. It has a palatable seed though not as abundant as the kafirs, a sweet growthy stalk, and In fact combines most of the good qualities of the two groups. It is grown extensively and is well known particularly as a silage crop. Among the grain sorphums are found two other general types. They are Milo and Feterita, both of which are used extensively as grain in feeding. They differ mostly from the kafirs in that the forage produced is inferior. The grain produced, however, is often abundant and palatable. Millet is another grain very commonly referred to as a sorghum. This is especially true of Proso or hog millet. Strictly speaking the millets are grasses, with much finer growth than the sorghums. There are two classes of millet — the foxtail and Proso. The former is strictly a hay crop which has small seed. Proso, however, is grown as' a grain crop and thus enters into the feeding operations of livestock. Summing up, the sorghums of greatest interest to livestock men are the kafirs, including milo and feterita because heavy yields of </seg>
            <seg id="p658">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE palatable grain are produced by them. We are less interested in Atlas and the Millets because the best grains for feeding are not produced from these crops. And we have little interest in the canes because they are so bitter and unpalatable. Having classified the sorghums and considered those that are most likely to be of value as a grain crop, the next thing to discuss is their potential feeding value as compared with corn in livestock feeding. In livestock feeding, the value of any particular feed is, generally speaking, determined by the amount of digestible nutrients it con - tains. And since corn is the grain most commonly fed to livestock and the best known because it is palatable and because there is gen - erally an adequate supply of it, and also because it furnishes an abundance supply of energy for fattening and maintenance, I think jse can get at the potential value of sorghum grain for livestock pur - poses by comparing it with this grain. Some analyses of some of the different grains have been recently made at the Kansas Agricultural Experiment Station, and when con - verted into the digestible nutrients we find that corn has 7.8% protein, €6.7% carbohydrates, 4.3% fat; whereas kafir has 7.8% protein, 57.1% carbohydrates, and 2.7% fat. Cane has 7.0% protein, 52.1% carbohydrates, and 3.1% fat. From this it is seen the sorghums do not rank quite as high as corn in digestible nutrients but almost as high. On the basis of this information it is likely that the kafirs would not produce quite as good results from feeding as would be produced by corn. There is, however, another point to be taken into account in con - sidering the relative efficiency of different feeds when studied from their digestible nutrient content. By this I mean its palatability. Even though two feeds may have the same relative amount of digestible nutrients, when fed to livestock, one of them may not be equal to the other because one is more unpalatable than the other. It his been estimated that this factor reduces the feeding value of many of our best sorghums by at least 4 or 5 per cent when compared with corn. Some sorghums, as those' with the bitter seed, may of course be so : unpalatable that stock will not eat them at all, even though an analysis will show them to rank very close to corn in their content of digestible nutrients. With this understanding of the relative value for feeding of the sorghum grains when compared with corn, let us consider some actual feeding tests when fed to livestock. A feeding trial conducted at the Kansas Agricultural Experiment Station with fattening calves, showed that one pound of ground kafir had practically the same feeding value as one pound of ground corn. In this test calves weighing approximately 450 pounds, fed 180 days </seg>
            <seg id="p659">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION on ground kaflr, cottonseed meal, alfalfa hay, and silage, gained 424 pounds with an average daily gain of 2.35 pounds; while those fed ground corn and. the same supplemental feeds and roughage, gained 431 pounds with an average daily gain of 2.39 pounds. With fattening lambs it is much the same story and experimental feeding tests show that Kaflr may be substituted for corn in a grain ration. There is probably more sorghum grain fed to swine than to other classes of livestock. When experimental results are considered, it is found that hogs also will utilize these grains almost as efficiently as corn and that ground kaflr, feterita, or milo is worth about 90 per cent as much as corn for fattening swine. In the winter of 1930, Atlas sorgo was compared with corn as a grain for fattening hogs. In this test 70-pound pigs fed 110 days on ground Atlas gained 182 pounds at the rate of 1.66 pounds per day. The corn-fed pigs gained 188 pounds at the rate of 1.72 pounds per day. The Atlas was readily consumed by the pigs and was considered to be worth 93.5 per cent as much as corn. In spite of the fact that the sorghum grains have practically the same feeding value as corn, there are certain rules that must be fol - lowed in order that livestock will most efficiently utilize the nutrients. First. It is very essential to feed a protein supplement with sor - ghums, just the same as it is essential to feed one with shelled corn. In fact more tankage is needed with sorghum grains than with corn. As has been seen from the composition of sorghum and corn, it is relatively low in protein and high in carbohydrates. This neces - sitates a balancing by the addition of some protein supplement such as tankage, skim milk, Trinity mixture, or the like. Second. Since the grain sorghums are hard and comparatively small and not easily masticated, they should all be ground for hogs. They should not be ground too fine but well crushed. This applies particularly to hogs, through which a large part of the whole grain will pass undigested if fed unground. The value of grinding kaflr was. demonstrated in a test when pigs fed ground kafir, shorts, tankage, alfalfa hay, made an average daily gain of 1.4 pounds and required 534 pounds of concentrates for 100 pounds gain. While others, fed whole kafir instead of ground kafir, gained only 1.15 pounds and required 34 per cent more concentrates for each 100 pounds of gain. Third. It is perfectly safe to self-feed the sorghums, free choice, together with the protein supplements. Hogs will not over-eat any more than they would over-eat on self-fed corn. </seg>
            <seg id="p660">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Fourth. Many hog feeders like to mix the sorghums with other grains, as with ground wheat or ground corn. This plan is quite all right and hogs will do well on such mixtures. A protein supplement should be mixed in also or self-fed separately. There are two other methods of feeding sorghums that should be mentioned. First, the matter of feeding in the head. Experiments that have been conducted with pigs in feeding kafir in the head show that slightly smaller gains are made than on ground kafir, but the gains were as cheap as on the ground kafir because the cost of threshing and grinding was eliminated. No doubt kaflr heads gave better re - sults than the threshed kafir because in picking the grain from the heads it was chewed up more thoroughly than was the threshed grain. Many hog feeders believe that soaking the hard grains of sorghums -will add to the palatability and feeding value. Generally speaking, soaking is not to be recommended. It is a poor substitute for grinding. I have said little so far regarding the comparative feeding value of Milo, Feterita, and Cane compared with Kafir and corn. In general, however, it may be said that Milo and Feterita are generally a little better feed than Kafir, being worth up to 95 per cent as much as corn. Kafir is the least valuable of the three sorghums, generally being worth about 90 per cent as much as corn. The cane seed from the sweet sorghums is not as palatable to hogs as the grain sorghums. In three trials at the Kansas Agricultural Experiment Station, pigs fed cane seed with a protein supplement gained 1.2 pounds daily compared with 1.6 pounds when corn was fed instead of cane seed. The cane seed then was worth only 63 per cent as much as corn and only about 70 per cent as much as kafir. Mixing cane and corn will provide a fairly good ration and the pigs will make rapid gains, but the relative value of the cane seed will remain the same. Cane seed should be ground when fed to hogs. In conclusion, I would like to mention a palatability test on the sorghum grains that was made recently at the Kansas station.

This mixture was later modified by certain substitutions or additions and we heard of "Big 11", "Big 13" etcetera supplemental mixtures for swine. These mixtures were effective and under price relationships existing from 1920 to about 1931 were economical, especially under dry lot and poor pasture feeding conditions. During these same years various supplemental blends were used in the rations of fattening cattle. The close price relationships, how - ever, that usually existed between the protein feeds of vegetable origin and the fact that the protein mixtures of blends seldom surpassd the best single protein feeds in effectiveness did little to increase their popularity. We heard little about meat meal tankage as a protein supplement for cattle prior to 1930 and not much more until 1933. It is true that a few feeding trials had been carried on to show that this animal product could be used in the cattle fattening yards, but very little was actually fed in the feed yards of the Corn Belt until its price dropped to or even below the level of several of the protein feeds of vegetable origin. The favorable price relationship and the fact that the dry rendered process tankage was available in much larger quantities than it had been a few years ago stimulated the rise of this animal product in the ration of fattening and other cattle both at the experiment stations and in the feeding yards. The dry rendered tankage had proved to be a more effective protein supplement for swine than the wet rendered product. It had some - what less odor and was therefore supposed to be more palatable to cattle and sheep. The Ohio Station had had good all-around results when a blend of protein feeds and minerals, carrying approximately one-third dry rendered tankage had been fed to fattening cattle. This Station, therefore, recommended this blend as an all-purpose protein supplement for cattle. It was made up as follows: Dry rendered tankage 30 pounds, soybean oilmeal 30 pounds, cottonseed meal 20 pounds, linseed oilmeal 15 pounds, ground limestone 2 pounds, special steamed bone meal 2 pounds and common salt 1 pound. During the past two years, the Minnesota, Illinois and Iowa Stations have reported work with dry or both wet and dry rendered tankages for fattening cattle. These tankages have been fed alongside of both linseed oilmeal and soybean oilmeal. In general the steers fed tankage have made about as much gain as those fed the good vegetable source protein feeds, but in some cases the tankage fed steers have apparently had less finish and therefore sold for less money per hundredweight. It seems that the method of processing tankage makes little difference </seg>
            <seg id="p663">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION in the effectiveness of this animal product as a protein supplement for cattle, for in some trials the wet has made a better all-around show - ing while in others the dry rendered product has been ahead. In the light of our present knowledge it seems that a high quality meat meal tankage is about on a par with our best protein supplements of vegetable origin and that it may be advantageous to make use of this animal product in the rations of the fattening cattle whenever it can be purchased for a lower price than such feeds as linseed oilmeal. Future trials and experiences may prove that certain blends of supplemental feeds may be more effective sources of protein for cattle and sheep than the old standby, linseed oilmeal, but so far this has not been definitely demonstrated. Some of our other protein feeds or blends of feeds give practically as efficient results as the linseed oilmeal and when they can be purchased for less money will give more economical results. Price relationships, therefore, should always be considered in choosing the protein supplement for the cattle yards. The rapid expansion of the soybean as a seed crop in Iowa as well as in some other parts of the Corn Belt during the past decade has been responsible for marked changes in the protein-buying habits of many of our feeders. The growing of soybeans for seed has given us a home-grown feed that is relatively high in protein. A ton of the common varieties of soybeans carries practically as much crude protein as a ton of old process linseed oilmeal. Unfortunately these same soy - beans carry from 15 to 20 per cent of oil which has proved to be a distinct disadvantage, particularly when used in appreciable amounts in the rations of growing and fattening pigs. Young growing pigs fed sufficient soybeans along with corn grain to furnish the needed proteins will produce soft carcasses and therefore a low grade of product. Whole soybeans are a fairly satisfactory source of protein for brood sows, and when supplemented with a good mineral mixture and some alfalfa meal or hay, are an efficient supplemental feed for the pregnant and suckling sows. Growing and fattening pigs, fed on high class pastures, make a fairly satisfactory showing when soybeans are fed. The quality of the pork, however, is very likely to be de - leterlously affected. Soft pork will surely result if the pasture supply is not plentiful and high in quality or when soybeans are depended upon as the protein supplement for pigs fed in dry lot. Soybeans are more effective sources of protein in the rations of fattening cattle and sheep than in those of swine. A daily allowance per lamb of from 0.1 to 0.2 pound of whole or cracked soybeans has been an effective protein supplement for fattening lambs. Soybeans are not quite as effective a source of protein for fattening cattle and there Is considerable lack of uniformity in the results obtained in different years and at different experiment stations. </seg>
            <seg id="p664">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Fattening cattle fed soybeans in considerable quantity over a long feeding period will usually not consume as much corn or other grain as cattle fed some of the other good protein supplements. This is to be expected since the high oil content of the beans will replace some of the corn carbohydrates. Where soybeans are used as a protein supplement for cattle on a long feed, it seems to be good practice to use the beans in the first part of the period, and when the cattle tire of them change to another protein supplement. Some packer buyers have reported cases where cattle fed soybeans kill "dark" with a soft yellow fat. Work at the Iowa Agricultural Ex - periment Station does not bear this out, since carcasses of steers fed both soybeans and soybean oilmeal have been on a par as far as firmness of fat and color of the beef is concerned with those of similar steers fed linseed oilmeal. In fact, carcasses of steers fed soybean oil in considerable quantity showed no indications of softness of fat or dark color of lean which could be attributed to the oil feeding. Soybean oilmeal, a by-product of the soybean oil industry, has rapidly come to the front as a protein supplement for all classes of livestock during the past several years. Soybean oilmeal is not a parti - cularly new protein feed, for a limited supply has been available for some yeai-s. Much of the earlier work showed it to vary considerably in effectiveness. The variability of this feed, the rather limited supply and the fact that it was usually priced about the same or even a little higher than linseed oilmeal limited its use, particularly in the cattle rations. The bulk of the soybean oilmeal produced prior to the last five or six years was used in rations of fattening swine. The value of soybean oilmeal varies to a considerable extent, being dependent upon the process used in its manufacture and especially upon the temperature used in the processing. Proper heat treatment is very important particularly in the preparation of a soybean oilmeal for swine. Soybean oilmeal with a raw bean taste is much less palatable and likewise less effective as a protein supplement for swine and prob - ably cattle and sheep. There are at the present time three standard methods used in the processing of soybeans and the preparation of the soybean oilmeal. These methods are the solvent, oftentimes called the new process, the hydraulic and the expeller methods. The processes vary in the method by which the removal of the oil is effected. The cooking temperature and the length of time the soybean oilmeal is heated vary with the processes and in the different processing plants. The solvent process soybean oilmeal has been available a relatively short time, hence it has not been tried in experimental rations as often as the hydraulic and expeller types of soybean oilmeal.

            <seg id="p666">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE FEEDING SMAIjIj GRAINS M. L. BAKER Under normal conditions, the feeding of small grains is not of much general interest in Nebraska. Conditions during the past few - years have created quite a lot of interest in the subject and there are always some operators who are interested in it. A few years ago we did some work at the North Platte Substation using wheat and rye for fattening calves. Because of that, or because it is a relatively harmless topic, I am usually elected to discuss the feeding of small grains at these meetings. I trust that you will not blame me for this but assess the blame where it rightfully belongs on those who prepared the program. Most of you will find little that is new in what I have to say. Corn is and should be the great American feed. Supplemented as it can be in our part of Nebraska with alfalfa, it leaves little to be desired as a cattle finishing ration and of course goes hand in hand with swine production throughout the nation. Wheat may be substituted for corn with very good results. For fattening hogs, coarsely ground wheat is fully equal to shelled corn and will often prove as much as ten per cent more efficient. There is less advantage in grinding wheat when the wheat is self-fed than when hand-fed. Like corn, it should be fed with high protein concentrates, but especially in dry lot feeding less of these feeds will be required than with corn. In my opinion soaking wheat or other small grains for hogs serves only one useful purpose and that is to provide the feeder with employment. For fattening cattle, coarsely ground wheat can be used to replace up to two-thirds of the corn in the ration without adversely affecting the quality of the ration. In fact we have fed calves on wheat as the sole concentrate with very good results. Such calves gained as well and sold for as much as similar calves finished on corn, but we considered that they carried somewhat less finish than the corn-fed calves. Wheat may also be used for fattening lambs. Whole wheat is almost as palatable for lambs as shelled corn, but worth only 85 to 90 per cent as much. Ground wheat is not so palatable and hence is not easy to feed. A mixture of ground wheat and ground corn con - taining as much as 75 per cent wheat will produce as rapid and as eco - nomical gains from the standpoint of feed consumed per unit of gain as corn. In order for the feeding of this mixture to be profitable, wheat must be slightly lower in price than corn. Barley is a crop which has been receiving more and more attention in Nebraska during the past few years. Because of its high percent- </seg>
            <seg id="p667">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION age of fiber, its feeding value varies considerably with its weight per bushel. For fattening hogs, ground barley is worth about 85 per cent as much as shelled corn when both are fed with high-protein supplements. Ground barley is about 6 per cent more efficient than whole barley. For fattening cattle, ground barley is worth about 85 to 90 per cent as much as corn. Barley is highly prized by some successful feeders as a part of the grain ration for fattening cattle. It is used extensively for feeding lambs in some sections of the country and is worth about three-fourths as much per pound as corn for that purpose. It does not pay to grind barley for lambs. Oats are grown extensively in Nebraska and are justly prized as a livestock feed under certain conditions. As a rule, however, they are high in price when compared with other grains and are not as indis - pensable as is sometimes supposed. It seems probable that not more than one-fourth the grain ration for either fattening cattle or hogs should consist of oats. In this proportion, ground oats of good weight are worth about as much per pound as corn. In larger amounts the value of oats drops rapidly. Oats may be used to a greater extent in the ration of the breeding animal than for fattening stock. For lambs, oats should comprise not more than one-third the ration and are worth about 80 per cent as much as corn. Probably in smaller mounts they have a somewhat higher value than this. Oats are usually fed whole to sheep. They should be ground for hogs and for fattening cattle. Rye as a crop is usually sold in this state. In many sections of the state it is doubtful if this is good practice. Coarsely ground, It may replace one-half the corn in the ration for fattening cattle and hogs In this proportion it is worth about as much per pound as corn in the cattle ration and from 80 to 85 per cent as much as corn in the swine ration. It may be fed satisfactorily as the sole grain to hogs on pasture and is worth about 80 to 85 per cent as much as corn when fed on pasture with a protein supplement. Whole rye is fully as valu - able as whole wheat for fattening Iambs or approximately 90 per cent as valuable as shelled corn. It is not advisable to grind rye for lambs. A limited amount of experimental work indicates that two pounds of ground wheat, oats, rye, or barley, are equal to from three-fourths to one pound of cottonseed cake when fed to calves being wintered on carbonaceous feeds such as silage or wild hay. There are some minor grains which receive some attention under Nebraska conditions. Work done at North Platte indicates that ground proso or Hershey, or hog millet, as it is variously called, has about the same value as ground rye for fattening hogs. Dr. Aubel of the Kansas Station has discussed the grain sorghums in which there is considerable </seg>

For some time to come, we shall feed corn when he have it, and can afford to feed it. Properly used, the small grains offer reasonably satis - factory substitutes for corn and may at times lower the cost of livestock gains appreciably. In feeding them, the characteristics in which they differ from corn should be considered; they should be properly supplemented for the class of stock to which they are fed; it should be remembered that wheat, barley, and rye, are not as fool-proof as corn; and mixtures containing them should be evenly mixed. FEED DEFICIENCY PROBL.EMS IX NEBRASKA WM. J. LOEFFEL I have no hesitation in saying that the outstanding deficiency in Nebraska hog rations is the lack of protein. Pigs are produced pri - marily on cereal grains all of which are low in protein. If we give a mechanic enough engine parts to build 100 engines and only bolts enough to build 50, then 50 engines is all that he can construct. We have many pigs with the inherent growth ability to gain 1.4 pounds a day. Many of these pigs are getting enough protein only to gain .75 pound a day and, therefore, .75 pound is all they are gaining. The protein is a limiting factor in growth. The word protein comes from the Greek and means "of first importance". Those of us who have been intimately connected with nutrition investigations are coming more and more to realize how important a part protein plays in growth and health. Protein is abundantly supplied in the dairy by-products, the packing house by-products such as tankage, the milling by-products such as shorts, and the oil meal by-products, linseed, cottonseed and soybean oil meal. To a certain extent, pigs may utilize the protein in alfalfa hay and alfalfa pasture. Because of its bulk, however, this feed can ■ be utilized to supply only a part of the protein requirement of the pig. Young rapidly growing pigs, pregnant and nursing sows have the greatest need for protein. In the case of fattening hogs, protein is im - portant not only from the standpoint of building up the pig's body but also to stimulate the appetite and digestion. Sometimes people get the idea that when you are feeding a little tankage to pigs that they </seg>

I have seen the feeding of a small amount of tankage actually double the rate of gain. I do not want you to get the idea that tankage is the only protein supplement for there are many other splendid ones. I use it for my illustrations, because we have done more work with it and its ready availability and uniformity make it exceptionally useful for our experimental work. In our dry lot feeding work where tankage is self-fed, a pound of or 1'" OnTT "'T r rePlaCeS in the »«**»&gt;*°&lt;* of 6 pounds o com On pasture, I have seen a pound of tankage replace only 4 pounds of corn. These figures mean that under the conditions sug - gested you can afford to pay from 4 to 6 times the price of corn per pound for a pound of tankage. The higher the price of grain, natural" the more you can pay for the supplement. A year or two ago we were growing out some pigs on pasture. We were feeding these pg S on y a half ration of corn.

This mixture is inexpensive and con - tains all of the elements which are likely to be lacking in mature pig rations. There is another type of mineral deficiency which is becoming of Increased importance. This is the lack of iron and copper in the rations of suckling pigs which brings about a condition known as anemia. It is encountered in young suckling pigs, particularly where the clean ground system of management is being followed and the pigs farrowed on concrete which has been thoroughly cleansed. For - merly, pigs were farrowed on the dirt. The young pigs could root in the soil and in so doing secure the iron .and copper which are nec - essary for the formation of red blood cells. As we kept on producing pigs on the same soil it became infested with parasite eggs and per - meated with disease germs so that it was no longer possible to produce healthy pigs in the old hog lots. Then came the clean ground system. The concrete farrowing pen replaced the dirt pen. The concrete was cleansed and scalded with lye water. The sow was scrubbed before she went into the farrowing pen. The newly farrowed litter was kept in this concrete pen for varying lengths of time. There was no op - portunity for them to root in the soil to supply their needs for iron and copper. The pigs failed to grow, they seemed to shrivel up, their hides wrinkled and appeared to be too big for them. Close examination revealed that the gums were pale. The pigs began to die. Autopsy re - vealed a thin watery blood, enlarged hearts and frequently pneumonia. Milk is the normal feed of the young pig. It is a splendid feed rich in everything that the young growing animal requires except iron and copper. Regardless how much of these elements we feed a sow, she cannot secrete them in her milk. Therefore the only opportunity of getting iron and copper to a pig is by direct feeding. A water solution of copper sulphate and copperas (iron sulphate) may be administered as a drench to every pig daily. This is quite a "chore" so several of our experiment stations have suggested mixing the copper-iron solution with syrup and painting it on the udder of the sow twice a day. Thus, as the pigs nurse they get their iron and copper. Here also numerous difficulties are encountered. Many sows with newly farrowed litters object very strenuously to this procedure. When it is done successfully the bedding sticks to the sow's body. Dr. Graham of the University of Illinois has suggested a very simple solution of placing a chunk of un - contaminated sod in every pen. The young pigs can meet their re - quirements for iron and copper in this way.

            <seg id="p672">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE On the other hand, the development and maintenance of a stable agriculture in Nebraska will depend largely on the conservation and wise use of our soil and water resources. If this principle is accepted, soils unsuited to arable farming should remain in grass or other uses, and all cropping and cultural practices should be adjusted to maintain these basic resources. Livestock production, in turn, will be guided by crop production and other economic factors. Soil Areas Proper and effective land use depends in a large measure on a general recognition of soil and climatic factors. Soil is not merely the material of the land regardless of depth. It is the surface portion and is slowly formed from the underlying material as a result of weathering processes. It is, therefore, the end product of the parent material, the environment under which it develops, and time. In view of the fact that years are required to develop productive soils, their wasteful depletion may become a serious menace. Vvery extensive information has been developed in Nebraska con - cerning soil resources. The Conservation and Survey Division, Uni - versity of Nebraska, in cooperation with the Bureau of Chemistry and Soils, United States Department of Agriculture, has published de - tailed soil survey reports and maps or completed field work for all Nebraska counties excepting eight in the sandhill region. Seven general soil areas (Fig. 1) may be located and described on the basis of topography and origin of the parent material or mantle rock. The glacial soils are developed on glacial drift or the material carried by the two great ice sheets which at one time covered the eastern one-fourth of the State. During later periods this glacial material for the most part was covered with windblown or loessial material. Glacial soils have developed on the drift which was left uncovered or exposed as a result of erosion. The most extensive areas are found in southeastern Nebraska with smaller areas outcropping elsewhere in the glaciated area. In general, glacial soils are not considered as desirable and productive as loessial soils developed under similar topographic and climatic conditions. Loessial soils are developed on the windblown deposits or loess material. Due to the wide range in topographic and climatic conditions under which they have developed, they may be differentiated into sev - eral soil series. Some of the most extensive and productive soils found within the States are of loessial origin. The residual soils of the high plains are developed on bedrock of </seg>

The various Tertiary formations consisted of clay silt, sand, and other debris carried in from the highlands to the west and north. Wherever the mantle rock is sufficiently deep, extensive areas of relatively productive soils have been developed. Shallow soils bedrock outcrops, and rough broken land, however, are rather common to the high plains area. The sands and sandy soils of the sandhills, owing to their resistant nature, have not made much progress toward soil development The sands in these areas, which have been developed in the main from Tertiary deposits, shift about in dune formation whenever the vegeta - t on is destroyed. The mantle rock, in general, has developed con - siderable depth. The soils in the outwash plains are developed on sands and other mater a of glacial, Tertiary, and alluvial origin. In addition, these materials are. more or less intermingled with windblown or loessial deposits. The bottom land and bench soils are developed on alluvial or stream deposits. The older benches and terraces within the loessial area are frequently capped with the windblown material. Based on the nature of the parent material (i.e., whether it is of loessial. glacial, residual, or alluvial origin) and the soil profile (i e depth of surface soil, organic matter content, etc.), sixty-four soils have been named, described, and mapped in the various county soil surveys. The soils in these various series are commonly differentiated nto two or more types based on textural differences such as fine sandy loam silt loam, clay loam, etc. Approximately 275 such soil types have been described and mapped. In many instances, these soil types have been further differentiated into phases such as basin, flat, rolling stony, alkali, etc.. making a total of more than 400 soils. ■ In order to further evaluate these soils and land-use problems, the soils as mapped in the field have been placed in five broad groups based on their general inherent productivity and use capabilities.

After the soils were thus classified, the general productivity of the soils in Groups II to V were evaluated in terms of Group I as 100 per cent. Using these valuations, estimated percentage area under cultiva - tion by soil groups, and average county corn yields, corn yields have been calculated for each group of soils.

In general, the soils in Groups I and II are well suited to cultivation. In some instances the bottom land soils in Group I may not, as yet, be well drained or they may be subject to overflow and somewhat variable with respect to underlying sands and gravels. Group II soils consist, in the main, of the more level to rolling upland soils. Under proper farm management practices and erosion control methods on the rolling upland soils, it is believed that a high percentage of these soils may and should be retained in cultivation. Due to lower produc - tivity and generally greater erosive qualities, the soils in Group III should be cultivated less extensively than those in Group II and, in turn, soils in Group IV less than those in Group III. It would be dif - ficult to justify the cultivation of any soil in Group V except for limited feed crop production, and then only if more productive land is not available. 1 The maps in Figures 2 and 4 and the data in Tables 1, 3 and 4 were developed cooperatively between the Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station and various Fed - eral agencies engaged in land utilization research as a part of the 1935 Regional Planning Project. </seg>

            <seg id="p677">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION It may be expected, therefore, that the most serious and extensive land-use problems will be found in connection with the soils of Groups III, IV, and V. Such soils, improperly used, frequently become marginal or sub-marginal. Under proper use, however, they may be conserved and the return on the investment may be as high as that from soils inherently more productive. It is rather commonly believed that the more inefficient farmers tend to migrate to the poorer or so-called marginal land. This is probably true to a greater or less extent, particularly where such soils occur in relatively small areas and are more or less intermingled with more productive soils. Such tendency may be due to failure of the inefficient farmer to compete successfully with the more enterprising and efficient farmer for the more productive land, or it may be due to over-estimating the value of land or the uses to which it is adapted. Such soils, since they are less productive and more restricted with re - spect to use, probably require more ability on the part of the operator for their successful operation than more productive soils. Problem Areas Farmers, in the main, recognize soil and climatic limitations and have used or would use their land accordingly if it were possible to do so. Land-use problems are commonly associated with soil and topo - graphic conditions and are found wherever proper adjustments to these conditions have not been fully made. Areas characterized by rather distinct land-use problems because of certain soil and topo - graphic factors are shown in the Preliminary Problem Area Map, Fig. 3. The seriousness of. the water erosion problem on the silty and clayey soils of the rolling to rough uplands is not generally appreciated. Similarly .overcropping and grazing is resulting in serious wind erosion in certain sandy and loamy soil areas. It will be necessary to introduce rather extensive changes in present cropping and cultural practices to correct such land-use problems. It is to be noted that the major sand - hill region is not indicated as a problem area. Although land-use prob - lems resulting from overcropping and grazing in this area are rather common, the area for the most part is being properly and carefully utilized. The Soil Conservation Service recently completed a reconnaissance erosion survey of Nebraska with respect to type, degree and extent of erosion. The results of this survey are summarized in Table 2. It is estimated that twenty-five per cent or more of the acreages reported in Table 2 have been affected by the type of erosion indicated. The </seg>

Although considerable variation usually exists within such areas, certain dominant types of farming may be described. As a part of the Regional Planning Project of 1935, the Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station, in cooperation with various Federal' agencies engaged in land utilization research, made a further study of type of farming areas in Nebraska and developed preliminary cropping recommendations designed to maintain soil productivity. Earlier maps developed by Hedges and Elliott (Nebr. Agr. Exp. Sta. Bui. 244) and by Elliott (based largely on the 1930 U. S. Census) were used as a basis in developing the new map. Areas of similar physical condi - tions were also determined from a study of county soil survey maps and the generalized areas shown. in Figs. 1, 2, and 3. In addition, a further Btudy of Federal and State Census data was made on both a county and minor civil division basis in order to measure trends and existing practices. In a number of instances, particularly in critical areas, field schedules pertaining to farm organization were obtained. The revised type of farming area map, Fig. 4, follows natural boundaries </seg>

            <seg id="p681">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION as closely as county and township lines will permit and at the same time probably measures more accurately the existing types of farming than either of the earlier maps. County and state lines seldom follow natural boundaries. Since type of farming areas tend to follow natural boundaries, such "areas may be expected to extend across county and state lines. Careful con - sideration was given to inter-county and state relations in the 1935 Regional Planning Project. The type of farming areas, bordering the state line (Fig. 4) were found in each instance to extend into the adjoining state or states. The type or types of farming and the names used in the legend accompanying this map are carried forward from the Elliott 1930 U. S. Census map and are descriptive of the location and characteristics of the areas. Since the areas on this map follow natural boundaries more closely than on the original map, the area descriptions in some instances may not be fully applicable. Cropping Recommendations The first step considered in developing the cropping recommenda - tions for the various type of farming areas was to evaluate the per - centage farm area under cultivation in terms of soil conservation and economic farming. To aid in this evaluation, a soil classification table similar to Table 1 was prepared for the various type of farming areas. What are believed to be conservative estimates were then made of land that should be retired from arable farming and returned to per - manent pasture or devoted to other uses. These estimates approxi - mated 12 per cent of the crop land or somewhat over two and a quarter million acres. The second step was to set up cropping systems for the land to remain in cultivation. Such recommendations were based on past practice, soil conservation, and good farm management. Basic data pertaining to the 1929 and recommended cropping systems, together with the percentage changes are summarized in Table 3 for the State as a whole. The cropping recommendations are also considered very conserva - tive. They are based on the crop year 1929 and in some instances the proposed changes have already been introduced to a greater or less extent. It is to be noted that rather marked decreases are recommended for the major grain crops. Increases are recommended for certain crops, however, such as sorghum, primarily for the sbuth central areas, and rye for sandy soils. Although rather marked increases are recommended for the tame hays, particularly in the eastern sec - tions, the increases are not as great as would be desirable. Greater increases were not recommended because growing conditions over </seg>
            <seg id="p682">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE much of the State are not favorable for the varieties of legumes and grasses which are available. It is believed, however, if the proposed cropping changes are adopted and at the same time accompanied by proper cultural practices, that considerable improvement in rotations and soil conservation will result over present practices.

System I attempts to measure an immediate effect of the cropping recommendations, whereas, System II measures the long time effect with some allowance for improvement in cropping practices and a return to average carrying capacity of the land returned to permanent pasture. As may be observed from Table 4, there would be no decided change in production of total feed units (a five per cent decrease in the short time period, followed by a slight increase over the base period) under the recommended cropping systems. The change in type of feed produced, however, would be more marked. During the base period, the grain crops comprised approximately 64 per cent of all feed units, whereas, under the recommended systems they would constitute ap - proximately 55 per cent. It is recognized that any marked change in amount or type of feed units produced will have an effect on livestock production. Due to the many production and demand factors which are involved and various price relationships, it is difficult or impossible to supply valid esti - mates of the effect that the recommended changes in the cropping system would have on livestock production. If a rather marked shift is made from grain to hay and pasture crops, it would appear that livestock feeding and production might be affected in one or more of the following ways (1) shifts made in the feeds similar to those made in crop production, (2) to continue feeding </seg>

In conclusion, it would appear that a sound land-use program should be given first consideration. It is evident that certain changes must be made in cropping and cultural practices if a permanent and stable agriculture is to be developed and maintained. Such changes obviously would be made gradually permitting parallel adjustments in the livestock enterprises. CATTIiE MANAGEMENT IX AREAS SUBJECT. TO OCCASIONAL DROUTH R. R. THALMAN, Lincoln During the course of the program this morning you have heard five or six speakers talk on the subject of pastures and pasture grasses. There has been a great deal of encouragement to Nebraska farmers to plant more of their acreage to grass. I am wondering if all of us are aware that any pasture program which is put into effect on any farm involves livestock, principally cattle'. It should also be remembered that any livestock program which is started on a farm is not a day </seg>
            <seg id="p685">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION by day or a season by season project. Livestock must be taken care ot and fed every day, year in and year out. While the winter feeding problem is usually looked upon as the greatest in the handling of live - stock, we should not lose sight of some of tbe problems which arise during the summer months. What has been said regarding pasture grasses and the cultivation and seeding of pasture is all well and good but there come times in this state when anything that man can do will not provide a good stand of grass. Probably the greatest injury to a livestock farmer comes during that time. Most men provide feed for the winter months and depend upon grass to carry their stock through the summer. When the grass fails they are left with a group of hungry animals for which feed must either be purchased immediately or the animals sent to market. If pastures over a large area fail, everyone knows what happens to the value of starved out livestock when the market becomes a general dumping ground. Nebraska is a state in which a large portion of it is subject to drouth. Almost every year some part of the state sees a dry spell during the summer months when pastures fail com - pletely. It is during these times that the livestock farmer either makes or breaks himself. Unless he is prepared for a possible grass shortage during the summer, he must go out of the cattle business when these drouths occur. I think it would be well to keep in mind that any pasture program involves the use of livestock and they in turn a program which would provide feed any time during the year if necessary. This reserve supply of summer feed, I believe can best be supplied through the use of silage. I could cite a great many farmers running a herd of cattle who have made the statement that they would have been out of the business had they not had a silo full of ensilage during one of these summer dry spells. For southeast Nebraska I am inclined to think that more farmers should plant a small acreage of their farm to one of the cane or sorghum crops purely for a supply of forage. These crops withstand drouth much better than corn and outyield corn for silage approximately two to one. A few acres in a crop of this kind should provide enough silage to carry the stock through the winter months and also provide a reserve feed supply for a possible shortage during the summer. With the trench silo proving so popular in the non-sandy areas of the state, I do not believe there is much excuse for a man not having an extra silo full of ensilage which he does not use during the winter months. A good slogan for the livestock farmer might be "A Second Silo on Every Farm". If the feed carried over during the summer is not needed, it will be available for the next summer or whenever it is needed. It is absolutely necessary for a man handling livestock to look farther into the future than just through the winter. </seg>
            <seg id="p686">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AN OUTSIDER'S VIEW Talk given by MR. DUNCAN MARSHALL at the ■ Nebraska Livestock Breeders &amp; Feeders Ass'n. Annual Meeting, January 8, 1836 In our country we are making considerable effort to eliminate disease from livestock. I think everybody who raises livestock of any kind realizes they must have them healthy. After all, the good live - stock man or boy is he who, when we are walking through the stable, can tell immediately whether a beast is ailing or not, or off its feed, or whether some care or attention should be given to it. That is the kind of man who is valuable. All the boys in my family are not endowed with that pecularity. I have three boys. Just one, the oldest boy, when he was a very small lad, when we walked through the barn could come back and tell what should be done to some of the cattle. The other boys do not have the "seeing eye". Perhaps that sort of thing Is where the statement originated: "The eye of the master fattened the ox." So the man who sees what is .going on is the valuable kind of a man. You have just heard a discussion about bot flies and their elimination from horses. We have done a little work on it in Ontario. I happen to have a paper in my grip showing that last year we found we treated 94,763 horses, by actual count, in Ontario for bot fly last year. That is not the whole number treated. There are a great many farmers who have been having veterinarians doing it or doing it themselves over a period of years. But under the direction of the Department, we had on farms where treatment had not been administered before, almost 95,000 horses treated. We did this in conjunction with treatment of cattle for" heel fly. We have this under way in better fashion. Last year 33 of our counties in Ontario ordered the treatment of all the cattle in the county for heel fly. Some people weren't willing to cooperate; if he wasn't we just said we would go on treating his cattle for him, and permission was never refused in any case. There is an organization between the Department of Agriculture of which I have charge, and the county council. We ask the county council to pay for the material required for the treatment, and then we arrange to have it purchased at very close wholesale prices so that the cost of treatment per animal is a trifle. We give the district agri - cultural representative who works through my department an extra </seg>
            <seg id="p687">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION man, or maybe two, lor a month or two when this treatment is being applied, so he has help enough to go about the county and super - intend the dipping or whatever you choose to call the application of this material for the killing of heel flies. We have the evidence in the counties, 33 of them in the last year where this work was conducted, and this year we hope to conduct it In every county in Ontario. We have evidence of the elimination entirely in cattle running through the field no matter how hot the weather was. When the treatment was applied for two years in suc - cession, we can say the 'heel fly is gone. ■ j We are treating a third year just as a precaution, particularly if this county is adjoining some other county in which the treatment has not been carried out. This year we hope to have the whole province under treatment for heel fly, and that two years from now heel fly will be a thing of the past. This means that the cows will give more milk and fatten better on grass. A friend of mine, Jimmy Walker, said ours is a poor country in which to raise cattle, the heel flies eat them up in the summer and the lice in the winter time, so the cattle must continually fight some pest. Consequently we are trying to introduce a treatment for lice. I had bought a bunch of steers, sent them to my brother. I hap - pened to remark that I had sent along a package of dry remedy and it is something to kill lice. He said, "Do you sprinkle the cattle in the barn every winter with this stuff?" "We certainly do. What is the use of having lice eat them up when you are feeding and fattening them?" I can tell just as soon as I go into a barn whether or not the cattle are bothered with lice. There will be perfect silence if they are not, but there will be plenty of chains rattling if they are. This is sold in this country, but in the winter time when you are either too lazy to wash them or when you don't care to apply any liquid to them, this remedy will save the cattle from lice. Lice seem to lie around the barnyard, waiting for the winter to come. There is no way of getting rid of them except treating them every year. I didn't hear the talk about Bang testing in Nebraska. I was hoping perhaps that I would hear something of that because we are going through the spasms of that in the province of Ontario. In the history of tuberculosis testing we find that the farmers paid for it. It is quite true the government recompenses them to some extent, but farmers had to take very heavy losses in testing during a time when the test for tuberculosis was inaccurate. There was a time </seg>
            <seg id="p688">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE at the start when any number of cattle were destroyed and there was no sign of T.- B. when they were examined afterwards. I believe the testing for tuberculosis is now as nearly as possible 100 per cent perfect, Bang's disease testing is not 100 per cent perfect, and I wonder if it is 50 per cent. We may test for Bang's disease and the cow will show reaction; she has a calf or two and then the disease seems to go down. We test again and she shows no distinct reaction and then perhaps she will go along for four or five years, and then for some reason or other, possibly because the disease is in the stable, it will light up again and she will react. We are going fairly slow with Bang's disease business. We had a regulation posted in Canada which I succeeded in having rescinded, by which every diseased beast that reacted should have a big "B" put on her cheek with some kind of acid so it would show plainly when the cow was in the field. In other words, they wanted to get the black - guards, and no government was prepared to pay any compensation. I have no grudge against individual surgery. They will organize to have as many tests for particular cattle long before the test are any ways correct and the farmer has to pay the shot. At a recent conference I succeeded in getting the federal minister of agriculture who has just newly assumed that position as a practical farmer in western Canada to rescind this as I didn't think any farmer's beast has any right to be marked for Bang's disease until there is at least a reaction. He believes it should have a second chance, as the test is very far from accurate. So I think so far as Bang's disease is concerned, we should move along and we should give the farmer at least a run for his money before we destroy his cattle. I do know that contagious abortion is a dangerous thing to get in a herd, but 20 years ago when I was buying a lot of cattle, in trainloads, purebred cattle, I used to go around every barn and field on a farm where cattle were that I was buying and I always have quietly counted the cows and calves, and if there were about as many cows and calves, I bought. If there seemed to be a shortage of calves and a lot of cows, I had reason to go away from the place without making a pur - chase, and in that very simple way I managed on my own farm to keep clear of the disease. I think that people should be very careful in what they buy. I don't object to a man when he is making pur - chase of breeding stock, demanding any test for disease. You can get disease fast enough without buying it. There are a few things you should not buy in the world. That applies to the farm. You can find bad land on your homestead without paying good money for it. </seg>
            <seg id="p689">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION Cattle are the same as the Scotsman says of the horse. "If he is good enough, he is good enough. If he is not sound in the feet and legs he is not good enough. If he has a lot of beef to carry on his badly con - structed legs he is handicapped. He would be better off without so much beef, unless it is in a country where they eat horse." While a good beast is never a bad color, you can breed enough with - out buying them, and when you go to buy livestock of any kind to improve those you have at home, be sure in the first place they are healthy, and be sure in the second place, they have no very objection - able features. Every time you bring poor characteristics into your herd you are running risk of propagating and multiplying them. I have no objection to men who are going to sales of purebred cattle demanding a test for Bang's disease and T.B. The test for T.B. has got so accurate now it is practically 100 per cent. We are at the present time In Ontario testing all the cattle in a large number of counties, particularly the counties that supply milk to the cities. There is a de - mand from milk companies for milk from cows that have been tested for tuberculosis. The demand for beef is good at the present time. I had all my cattle tested for tuberculosis and had no reactors. The government of the Dominion has tested over 12,400 of these steers, only 6 reactors in the 12,000. The fact is that one man might get the whole six and it would be a bad job for him. These are the things the government can do that will be of benefit to them and what they deserve to have done. It is a case of eliminat - ing disease from our livestock. When we have our foundation and all our breeding stock, when we have disease eliminated from them, and taken care of sanitary conditions, livestock will thrive better, our cows will give more milk, and there will be more profit to all farmers who are breeding purebred livestock. We are trying to establish disease-free areas as that is the only condition under which the government will pay. I am interested in the man who is breeding grade cattle. The purebred fellow can generally take care of himself. There are ten grade cattle breeders to one purebrd. The purebred raiser has no market until we have good grade farmers and men who are anxious to improve the standard. If you raise the standard of commercial cattle, whether they be milking cows or beef cattle, if you raise the standard, that is the end to begin with. If you can raise the standard of commercial cattle, there will be good prices for purebreds and make more profit to the man who is feeding them. </seg>

            <seg id="p699">Timely Problems of the Potato Producer and Suggestions Concerning Their Solution W. T. YOUNG, Jr., President I believe the most important thing in the mind of the Potato producer today, is what to do in order that he shall be sufficiently compensated to continue in the industry. Scientific methods of production have been proposed and practiced with satisfactory results. Grading and packaging are being improved upon each year. A more efficient transportation service has been developed in the past few years, but no control over the volume of .production, the quality to be shipped or a method of orderly market - ing has been effected. Why should we create an overabundance of crop, depleting our soil and eventually destroying ourselves the producers, or eliminate a number of producers of potatoes by the in and out methods of farm - ing followed in the past, causing in some years an undue scarcity and high prices bringing want to those least able to bear it. In as much as the volume of production of potatoes is very largely governed by weather conditions, lets provide a method of control to become effec - tive afler the crop is produced by grade and size limitations of potatoes marketed in interstate commerce and by a diversion plan subsidized by our present available import excise taxes. An attempt of the United States department of agriculture last fall to establish a marketing agreement and order regulating the handling of potatoes with the idea of a subsequent diversion plan of eliminating second grade potatoes, coupled with a frost scare, no doubt had a major part in temporarily advancing prices to a point where a reasonable return to the potato grower was realized. As soon as the general buying trade realized that this plan was not being adopted, they refused to buy quality potatoes and insisted on buying low grade potatoes at a low price which in turn soon lowered the price on all potatoes placing the entire crop on a very unprofitable basis. The prices were maintained at a loss level to the producer until the major portion of the crop had been marketed and a shortage of available supplies from this section became apparent. I believe that if this marketing agreement an order been established and a very limited amount of the low grade potatoes been diverted to stock feeding purposes, that we in this section would have main- </seg>
            <seg id="p700">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE tained the fall advance through the entire season. This would have in turn given the consumer a better quality potato at very little addi - tional cost. Due to the fact that transportation and handling charges exceeded the value of the potatoes and remained constant during high and low prices of the commodity. I would suggest that the Potato growers of this section take nec - essary steps cooperating with the United States Department of Agri - culture to establish marketing agreements and orders for this sec - tion and then extend aid and solicit cooperation with other territory having a common trade territory. When is a potato a seed potato? Let's sponsor a law determining a seed potato? A REVIEW OF THE DISEASE PROBLEMS CONFRONTING THE NEBRASKA GROWERS OF CERTIFIED SEED POTATOES 1 R. W. GOSS Dept., of Plant Pathology, University of Nebraska The disease data presented in Tables 1 to 5 have been compiled from the inspection records of all potato fields entered for certification in Nebraska during the years 1931 to 1935 inclusive. The two field inspections listed in the tables are made at the most favorable time for disease readings in each individual field. The first inspection is made during the early stages of growth when conditions are most favorable for the detection of mosaic, while the second inspection is made during the last part of the season when diseases such as Fusarium wilt are most severe. The bin inspection is made before the tubers are sorted for shipping. The certification acreage is devoted exclusively to the Bliss Triumph variety, with the exception of a few fields of the Irish Cobbler and Early Ohio varieties. While the numbers of acres or bushels inspected are listed in each table, the percentages are not calculated on an acre or bushel basis, but rather with each field entered for inspection as the unit, regardless of the size of the field. Fields varied from 5 to 100 acres, with an average of around 20 acres per field. It must be remembered in examining the tables that the percentages given do not indicate the total amount of disease occurring in these • "Published with the approval of the Director as Paper No. 174, Journal Series, Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station. </seg>
            <seg id="p701">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION fields. Many Infected plants are rogued out before the Inspections are made and those fields having more disease than the rules allow are rejected and do not appear in subsequent inspections. Because all of these fields are planted with either certified or foundation-stock seed potatoes and have seldom been planted to potatoes during the previous three or four years, the amount of disease is undoubtedly much less than occurs in the average commercial field. With these facts in mind, a critical examination of the data pre - sented in the tables reveals a number of interesting points regarding the relative prevalence and severity of the various potato diseases and their yearly variation resulting from weather conditions and other factors. The first five diseases listed in the tables are all virus diseases or combinations of such diseases. No attempt is made in the inspection records to differentiate between all of the types of mosaic. "Mild mosaic" in reality refers to mosaics that have only a slight effect on the plant and probably includes some crinkle or leaf-rolling mosaic. "Rugose mosaic", as here used, simply refers to the more severe types of mosaic or combinations resulting in severe symptoms. "Curly dwarf" indicates combinations of virus diseases resulting in severe •dwarfing and usually contains spindle tuber or unmottled curly dwarf as one component.

            <seg id="p702">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE It can readily be seen from the tables that rugose mosaic, unmottled curly dwarf, and curly dwarf do not occur in many fields, nor is there any serious amount in the few fields that are infected. Leaf-roll and other virus diseases not listed in the tables are even less prevalent. There are two good reasons for the scarcity of these diseases. It has been found that the insects that transmit these diseases are not found in great abundance in the dry-land sections of western Nebraska. This fact is further substantiated by the low incidence of these diseases in uncertified fields where roguing is not practiced, as compared with other parts of the state. The second reason is that these diseases have a severe effect upon the plant and are easily detected and removed from the field before much spread occurs. Mild mosaic is found in a larger number of fields, although the percentage of infection per field is not very great. The same state - ments made above regarding insect transmission would apply to this disease. In addition, the effects on the plant are so slight that they cannot be observed easily during periods of hot, dry weather and may thus escape detection. It is for this reason that a southern test plot, where cooler weather prevails during the early growth of the plant, is required for all Nebraska certified seed so that seed stocks containing excessive amounts of these milder forms of mosaic can be eliminated. The influences of weather conditions, not upon the occurence of this disease but rather upon its detection, are reflected In yearly variations in the percentage of fields infected, and in the variation in the number of fields found in the two inspections in any one year. An examination of the tables readily shows spindle tuber to be the most important of the virus diseases in this state. This is un - doubtedly due to the greater number of different insects that can trans - mit the disease and to their greater prevalence. Mechanical trans - mission by cutting knives or planting machines is also a greater factor than with the other virus diseases,- many of which are not known to be transmitted by these methods. In addition it is often difficult to detect spindle tuber in irrigated fields when there is abundant soil moisture, while in drought years, such as 1934, it is often impossible to distinguish spindle tuber from the stunted healthy plants, and as a result plants escape detection and this is reflected in the increased amounts present the following year. There were more fields rejected because of spindle tuber in 1935 than in any of the previous four years. The drastic roguing of infected plants and the elimination of many infected seed stocks some years ago reduced the amounts of this dis - ease to a point where many growers, particularly the new growers, have been lulled into a sense of false security. It is a disease that can increase so rapidly that both growers and inspectors must be constantly on the alert if we are to prevent a recurrence of the con- </seg>

Black-leg 1 is not a serious problem in Nebraska and only occurs in the low portions of a few fields. The term "Fusarium wilt" 1 as used in the tables refers to both the vascular type and the root and stem rots causing wilt. In the bin it refers to either stem-end rot or vascular discoloration. This disease is one of the most common ones in our potato fields, usually being found in 80 to 95 per cent of the fields, and results in serious losses both in the field and in the harvested crop. The average infection for the five years was about 3 per cent of the harvested crop, even after severe roguing had been practiced in the fields and after the most severely infected fields had been rejected. While this disease is often considered to be favored by high temperature and low moisture, it can be noted from the tables that the lowest amount of tuber infection occurred in the drought year of 1934. It has been the general experi - ence in this state that the greatest amount of infection occurs in the years most favorable for potato production. Unfortunately no specific remedies are available. Land which has produced severely infected crops should be avoided, and the later dates of planting usually re- Table 2: Summary of disease records 1932 Nebraska Potato Certification Inspections First Second Bin 483 fields 443 fields 362 lots 9,659 acres 8,742 acres 470,425 bushels Fields Aver, per Fields Aver per Fields Aver, per Disease infect. infect, infect, infect, infect. infect.

The most satisfactory control would be the use of resistant varieties, and investigations along this line are being started. Early blight 1 is usually not of great importance, considering the ■whole area, but may be very severe in some individual fields, parti - cularly those planted early and under irrigation. The disease may also cause considerable loss in storage. Tuber infection is most severe when an infected field is harvested during dry weather. The trouble may not appear until some time after harvest, and certified seed is not permitted to be shipped immediately after digging, because the dis - ease may appear later in transit or storage. It has not been con - sistently severe enough in the past to warrant the expense of protective sprays. However, as this disease is most troublesome in the same areas that are afflicted with psyllids, it is possible that the lime-sulphur sprays recommended for the control of this insect may also control early blight. Experiments on this point are being conducted. Rhizoctonia' causes its chief damage in this area by the production of the black sclerotia on the tubers, although in cool, wet springs considerable damage may occur in the form of sprout injury and stem lesions. Infected seed can be satisfactorily treated by any of the mercury treatments, but a great deal of infection arises from the soil. Rotations of at least four years are recommended. Under irrigation the disease has been more severe following beets and is greatly decreased by four- to six-year rotations following alfalfa or by applications of manure. Common and pitted scab 3 are caused by an organism that is ap - parently present in all soils in this area, and more severe in some soils than in others. Because of the presence of the parasite in the soil, seed treatments are not always satisfactory, although the hot formalde - hyde treatment has consistently increased the yield of apparently scab-free tubers in our experiments. The same recommendations given for the control of Rhizoctonia, as regards rotation and crop sequences, would also apply for scab. The best remedy for the scab problem would be the use of resistant varieties but unfortunately none of the known resistant varieties are adapted to this area. Breed - ing work is being started in the hopes of developing a satisfactory resistant variety for western Nebraska. This disease, like Fusarium wilt, is often thought of as being greatly favored by warm, dry weather but as with the wilt it can be noted from the tables that scab was of less importance in the dry year of 1934 than in any of the other years. This conforms with general experience in this area. 1 Alternaria solan i. * Rhizoctonia solani. 1 Actinomyces scabies. </seg>

However, as most of the growers know it by this name and as no descriptive name has yet been offered, we will use this term for the present. The tables reveal an apparently alarming increase in this disease during the past year but whether this is due to an actual spread of the disease, to its con - fusion with other troubles, or to a greater alertness on the part of the inspectors is open to question. The condition as it exists in Nebraska is not a new one. We have been observing these abnormal plants for at least 15 years but until the past three or four years they have not occurred in large enough numbers to cause us any great concern. In recent years, however, the occurrence of this trouble in seed stock shipped south has occasionally caused trouble and has led us to a closer study of the problem. The term "hay-wire" could and undoubtedly has been used to cover a multitude of abnormal conditions of unknown origin. In our certification work, however, it has, for lack of a better term, been used to designate a certain recurring symptom com - plex that I will attempt to describe. The disease usually occurs in tuber units. Normal-appearing tubers from apparently healthy plants, when grown in sterilized soil in the greenhouse, have produced the disease in units.

The same lot of seed planted in Nebraska, however, may show only the usual traces of the trouble. This disease is characterized by late emergence or missing hills, and sometimes the dormant seed pieces produce sprout tubers. The plants are severely dwarfed and with a rosette appearance due to a cessation of the terminal growth, a shortening of the internodes, and an increase in number and development of axillary shoots. The leaflets are usually rugose, erect, stiff, rolled, pointed, slightly yellowish and often with a purple coloration at the tips and margins. Petioles and stems may show swellings at the nodes with a red or purple pigmentation. Some - times aerial tubers are formed in the leaf axils. Tubers are lacking, or few, and set close to the stem. In many instances the underground stems appear perfectly healthy; in other cases, especially in the later stages of the disease, the underground stem may be completely rotted from the seedpiece to the surface of the ground and there may be a necrosis evident as a brown necking in the pith of the stems at the nodes. Cultures made from such necrotic areas have failed to reveal any pathogenic organisms. An additional symptom noted in a few plants growing in the greenhouse this year is a blighting of the terminal leaflet that extends a short distance down the stem, accompanied by the death of the pith in the stem, and this results in a hollow stem Table 4: Summary of disease records — 1034 Nebraska Potato Certification Inspections First Second | Bin 421 fields 293 fields 314 lots 9,162 acres 6,248 acres 319,849 bushels Fields Aver, per Fields Aver per Fields Aver, per Disease infect. infect, infect, infect, infect. infect. field field field Per Per Per Per Per Per cent cent cent cent cent cent Mild mosaic 1.7 0.1 5.5 0.2 Rugose mosaic 4.8 0.1 5.8 0.3 Spindle tuber 33.5 0.5 26.0 0.4 34.2 0.1 Unmot. curly dwarf 0.7 0.1 1.0 0.1 Curly dwarf 0.2 0.1 0.3 0.1 Black leg 2.6 0.1 1.7 0.1 0.6 tr Tusarium wilt 64.6 0.6 90.5 1.4 81.5 2.0 Early blight .... .... .... — - 2.9 tr Rhizoctonia .... .... .... .... 32.9 1.4 Common scab .... .... — — 43.5 1.3 Pitted scab .... .... — - — - 3.5 0.1 "Hay wire" 6.7 0.1 17.1 0.3 </seg>

It can readily be seen that the above de - scription, or at least portions of it, would fit any one of a number of well known diseases. On the other hand, none of these diseases is known to cause all of the above symptoms. One difficulty encountered in the study of this trouble has been the lack of tuber production by affected plants and the variable results obtained by planting the few small tubers occasionally obtained from such plants. Tubers sent to Lincoln from western Nebraska or from Louisiana obtained from plants suspected of having "hay-wire" have often produced either healthy plants or plants of the spindling-sprout type but without the usual symptoms of the trouble. These weak, spindling plants have produced tubers that have given rise to healthy plants the following year. Many of the characteristics of this disease, particularly its occurrence in tuber units from tubers that appeared healthy, indicate in combination with the symptoms and the absence of any pathogene, that the cause was probably a virus and possibly of the leaf-roll type. The failure to perpetuate the disease by tubers, however, threw considerable doubt on this theory. Another explana - tion of this lack of perpetuation, and probably the correct one, is the probability of inaccurate diagnois in the plants sent to us, which may have been suffering from some other malady such as Rhizoctonia, Psyllid yellows, Fusarlum stem-rots, or other diseases producing some- Table 5: Summary of disease records — 1035 Nebraska Potato Certification Inspections First Second Bin 538 fields 506 fields 400 lots 11,087 acres 10,480 acres 961,387 bushels Fields Aver, per Fields Aver per Fields Aver, per Disease infect. infect, infect, infect, infect. infect. field field field Per Per Per Per Per Per cent cent cent cent cent cent Mild mosaic 13.1 0.2 15.6 0.1 Rugose mosaic 4.8 0.1 2.7 0.1 Spindle tuber 50.0 0.4 49.8 0.3 52.5 0.5 Unmot. curly dwarf 1.5 0.1 0.6 0.1 Curly dwarf 3.2 0.1 1.0 0.1 Black leg 10.8 0.1 3.4 0.2 1.3 0.7 Fusarium wilt 20.6 0.2 77.8 0.9 97.8 2.4 Early blight 0.2 .... 2.0 .... 7.7 0.6 Rhizoctonia .... .... .... — - 33.5 2.6 Common scab .... .... .... — - 61.0 6.1 Pitted scab .... .... .... — - 35.2 6.0 "Hay wire" 47.4 0.3 42.3 0.4 </seg>
            <seg id="p708">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE what similar symptoms in certain stages of their development. This Is further borne out by the fact that during the past year a few tubers selected from "hay-wire" plants have produced spindling sprouts which after about a month's growth started to develop the leaf symptoms of "hay-wire" in the apical leaves. This was the first direct evidence connecting the spindling sprouts with common symptoms of "hay-wire". During the past ten years over a hundred attempts have been made to transmit the disease by juice inoculations or by the "tuber-plug" method but all have been unsuccessful. This past winter inarch grafts were made from several plants showing symptoms of "hay-wire" to healthy plants, which soon developed similar symptoms with a cessa - tion of treminal growth, a rolling of the leaves, aerial tuber production, and excessive pigmentation. Repetition and confirmation of these exploratory tests will be necessary before definite conclusions can be drawn, but the rather meagre evidence now available would indicate that we are dealing with another virus disease or a combination of viruses. Many of the characteristics are similar to those of leaf roll, but it is apparently distinct from that disease. It might well be termed "dwarf leaf-roll" or "rosette". Judging purely from circumstantial evidence, the disease is possibly transmitted by some insect. The very slow spread of the trouble would indicate that probably only one insect is involved and that this insect is not very prevalent in Nebraska. On the basis of the present informa - tion it should be rogued out of fields whenever it appears. Before closing I wish to make a few remarks concerning Pysllid yellows, sometimes known locally as "purple-top". While this is not included in the tables we do have some data from the certification records concerning its distribution and prevalence that would be of interest to you. At the time of first inspection only 16 out of 538 fields were found to have plants with symptoms of this trouble. By the time of second inspection 128 fields out of 506 were found to be affected. One hundred and twenty of these affected fields were in Kimball, Scotts Bluff, and Banner counties. The other eight fields were found in Box Butte, Morrill, and Sioux counties. There were no affected fields found in the other four counties of the certification area. The highest percentage (65 to 68 per cent) of fields affected was in Kimball and Banner counties where the trouble was more common and more severe than in Scotts Bluff, where 23 per cent of the fields were affected. In the latter county 9 5 fields were given a third inspection, at which time 40 per cent of them were affected. It can thus be seen that this trouble, which causes practically a total loss of affected plants, has become a serious problem. In the three counties most severely affected, control measures, that is, the application of sprays, have become essential. </seg>

WERNER, Department of Horticulture University of Nebraska 1 After a lot of potatoes has run the gamut of two or three field inspections and one bin inspection, the owner still has the obligation of doing more or less grading if the stock is to qualify as certified «eed or if a satisfactory price is to be realized for the potatoes as table stock A study of the certification inspection records for the last five years show that the potatoes which do NOT meet the requirements of a U. S. No. 1 grade or Nebraska Blue Tag grade constitute at least 10 per cent of the total crop of a grower and often involve over 6 0 per cent of the crop. Each year such potatoes have amounted to 28 to 46 per cent of the total crop produced by all certified seed growers Handling this quantity of defective potatoes is an expensive matter! This is not. new information to certified seed growers who have had the task of meeting grade requirements for certification. Perhaps an analysis as to the nature of the defects may be of value in determin - ing what steps could be taken to reduce this loss in sorting. Still more useful would be information concerning some dependable method for preventing the production of such defective potatoes, many of which can be salvaged for some purpose, but some of which eventually represent a total loss and all a partial loss. Detailed data for a number of years are presented in Tables 1 to 6 and serve as the basis for the following discussion. Mechanical injury has been the major trouble in all except the drouth year of 1934, when there were slightly more bushels of under - sized than of mechanically injured tubers. Mechanical injury is a serious trouble where there is much moisture at digging time and potatoes scuff and crack easily, or when the soil is very dry and hard, in which case clods and bare digger rods cause serious trouble. Although this matter has been gone into quite thoroughly at numerous times, further discussion is still warranted because of the seriousness of the situation. Percentages of mechanically damaged tubers were high in 1928 and 1931 because of soil that was not only dry at digging time but hard and cloddy as a result of pounding summer rains. (Table 1). In 1931 when there was little summer rain and no severe downpour in Kimball county, the percentage of damaged potatoes was lower than In other counties. In 1928 damage was less serious in Box Butte than In other counties because of a rain shortly before digging, which 'Published with the approval of the Director as Journal Series No. 185, Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station. </seg>
            <seg id="p710">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE softened the ground, whereas in Scotts Bluff the same results were secured by irrigation. In 1933 mechanical damage was high in Box Butte, Sheridan, and Dawes counties because of heavy rains in late August and again in mid-September. These promoted rapid tuber growth late in the season. In Kimball and Banner counties, there was considerable late August rainfall, but September rainfall was less, but the potatoes were still quite tender. The low percentage of damage there is attributable to the very thorough management of several large operators who had a number of fields. The excessive damage in Scotts Bluff resulted from too much late irrigation, complicated by late rainfall. The low percentages in 1929 in the Kimball-Scotts Bluff territory was due to the maturity of the tubers, the vines having been killed there by cold in early September. In other regions, although tubers were very tender the damage was low because the soil was moist, thus sticking to the digger rods and acting as a cushion at digging time. In 1934 damage was relatively low because of the extreme drouth that caused potatoes to be very much tougher than usual at digging time. Apparently the eccentricities of climate are so great that they cannot be depended upon to be of much value in most years, to avoid mechanical damage to tubers. At least it is becoming more and more evident that very careful methods of harvesting are essential in every season and that each season a different group of causes may be re - sponsible for damage to the tubers at harvest time. Climatic condi - tions are more likely to bring about undesirable conditions at digging time in some regions than in others, and in these less favored regions harvesting precautions become all the more important. The eventual solution of this problem depends upon the develop - ment of a variety which will be less susceptible to cracking and that will produce tubers on shorter stolons, so that they will not be cut so easily in digging, and also- one with ability to heal wounds very quickly. However, until that variety is a reality much can be ac - complished by very careful harvesting methods and by providing con - ditions most favorable for healing any wounds that may have occurred. It is now thought that the surface of tubers should be DRY when, going into storage then a high humidity and fairly high temperature should be maintained for the first few weeks of the storage period after which the customary low temperature should be used. Off-type tubers constituted the second most serious grade defect in most seasons. These off-type tubers consisted of undesirably elongated, knobby, or "bottle necked" tubers, or tubers with growth cracks. Most of such defective tubers were the result of growth being renewed after it had been checked once. Generally drouth, frequently accom- </seg>

The dry land farmer might conclude that he can do nothing about these rough potatoes if they are the result of irregular growing conditions. However, even on dry land something can be done. A crop rotation can be used which will insure a supply of subsoil moisture in the third to fifth foot where the roots can reach it in late summer when the moisture in higher levels may have been exhausted. Late planting so as to produce the entire tuber crop after hot weather is one of the most certain control measures. In an earlier publication' we have shown a direct relation between delayed planting and improved tuber shape and reduced percentage of cracked or knobby tubers 1 . Some off-type tubers are due to growing potatoes in a soil that packs easily and becomes very hard after a driving rain. Elongated tubers are sometimes produced in either hot or excessively moist soils. There are times when, in spite of his best efforts, the grower can do little to avoid off-type tubers. Scab seems to have been the third factor of general consequence in causing potatoes to be below grade. In some areas it is often the most important factor; in other areas it is seldom of much consequence. Throughout the five years considered it has been responsible for an annual grade loss of 2 to 5.5 per cent throughout the entire territory. It was generally most serious in the Box Butte-Dawes area and least in the Kimball-Banner area. In Scotts Bluff it was very serious some years and of little consequence in others. The best methods that can now be suggested to avoid trouble from scab are the use of a soil on which scabby potatoes are not produced, the use of relatively long crop rotations, and the medium to late planting (June 15-25). Damage from flea beetles in the form of "beetle tracks" or "pimply" potatoes is sometimes serious; in addition scab infection is sometimes possible because of the flea beetle damage. Late planting has been found a reasonably satisfactory method of control. Where this does not suffice spraying with lead arsenate is the best method to resort to. Oversized tubers are generally not a serious matter on dry land except in very moist years. In other years their occurrence can gen - erally be attributed to poor stands. These poor stands may be due to many things but very common causes are poor soil preparation, dry or hot soil at the seed-bed level, small seed pieces, or improper handling of seed at planting time. When soil moisture is abundant oversized tubers are very likely to result if seed pieces are too small or too few in number. If potato plants are subjected to drouthy conditions 1 H. O.

            <seg id="p712">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE during the early part of their life, the first tubers will be few and then if moisture is abundant later they will be excessively large and gener - ally rough. Late planting is a very effective means of avoiding over - sized tubers. In other words, the production of oversized tubers is to a large extent due to things that the grower does at or before planting time. Undersized tubers are a relatively minor factor except In the very dry years. Over a period of years more undesirable potatoes seem to have been produced by planting too few bushels per acre than by planting too many. Psyllids working on the potato vines cause various undesirable tuber conditions. They may cause the development of numerous small, dark-red tubers or frequently very rough and knobby tubers. This pest is very destructive in some areas. It seems to be p'resent in most of the areas, being especially serious in the Kimball-Banner and Scotts Bluff areas. Damage is always apparent earliest and is most severe along the edges of a field. Late-planted fields seldom suffer much loss from this pest. It can be controlled reasonably well by spraying two or three times with lime-sulphur at the rate of 1 gallon to 40 gallons of water. In some years serious loss occurs because of lesions developing on the tubers in the early part of the storage season, as a result of in - fection by the fungus causing early blight (Alternaria). The method generally recommended for controlling this disease is to spray the vines a number of times with Bordeaux mixture. As yet we have not had enough experience with this method in western Nebraska to permit us to make specific recommendations. This disease is more likely to be prevalent in irrigated than in dry-land regions, though in the latter it may be common in seasons with humidity above the average. Trouble from it is also generally avoided by late plantings. Over a period of years careful potato growers all have lost some potatoes because of frost. Even this loss might be reduced somewhat by cultural practices. With the Triumph variety there is likely to be much less damage from any frost than with the Irish Cobbler and with both of these varieties much less than with the Early Ohio. Deep planting brings about an increase in the depth at which tubers are set. While this may complicate digging it is a worth while practice, especially when one realizes that stands are generally better with deep than with shallow planting. Deep plowing, especially with heavy soils, will probably provide more favorable conditions for stolon growth at the deeper levels, and stolons may not be forced to grow so close to the surface as in compact soils. In hot weather many stolons continue to grow for a considerable time without setting tubers. Frequently they grow upward instead of horizontally or downward, so that finally </seg>
            <seg id="p713">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION when tubers are found they are found to be very close to the surface. Many observers believe that with early plantings tubers are generally nearer the surface than with late plantings. With any planting method much protection can be secured by throwing a high ridge of dirt over the row about the middle of September or when frost damage appears imminent. In conclusion it seems permissible to say that the grower can pre - vent or avoid much of the excessive loss that many still encounter because of the high percentage of potatoes that must be sorted out. This involves the use of the best production and best harvesting methods. Damage from practically all of the fungus and insect pests, scab, early blight, flea beetles and psyllids is largely avoided by reasonably late planting, i.e., June 15th to 22nd. At the same time this generally results in fewer oversized or rough and off-type tubers, and the shape and color of the tubers will be better than with early planting. However, such late planting involves the grower in a greater frost risk because of delaying harvest and may cause him to have tubers that are very delicate and very likely to crack at harvest time. This cracking can be minimized by constant attention to all details at haryest time so as to handle the tubers as carefully as possible. Crop rotation is of consequence in pest control and may be a factor in con - trolling tuber size and type. Plowing and planting depth are of much importance in the matter of frost control. Spraying may have to be resorted to for some pests but will be less necessary if early planting is avoided.

            <seg id="p719">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION MARKETING A SUPERIOR BRAND OP TABLE POTATOES FROM THE XORTH PLATTE VALLEY WM. MORROW Sales Manager, Nebraska Certified Potato Growers Cooperative The data presented to yoa by Dr. Werner, showing the sorting per cent of potatoes in the Valley, the cause of the sort out and the chance of eliminating a great deal of it, will serve as a very good introduction to the remarks which I can make relative to marketing superior table potatoes from this territory. Each year, we see a great many potatoes at harvest time which appear to be beautiful potatoes as they go over the digger. A short while later, on examining the bins of potatoes as they lay in storage, it seems almost impossible to find potatoes that will grade up, without a heavy sorting, into a fancy U. S. one package. In many bins it would prove impossible to put up an attractive package, regardless of how many potatoes were discarded. No grower can expect to produce fancy potatoes every year. In spite of the most approved practice, factors such as water shortage, extreme heat, pests, and others beyond the grower's control, will spoil the crop some seasons. We do have those growers, however, who have excellent potatoes nearly every year. We also have those growers who have very common quality, regardless of how well they might have been favored during the growing season. The percentage of excellent quality potatoes that are available for market during the winter is far too small in comparison to the percentage that are in the ground at harvest time. Too many potatoes are bruised, cut, smashed, feathered and otherwise damaged, from the time they are lifted out of the ground until they are in the bag and on their way to market. Careful, intelligent handling, can avoid most of this damage. Many growers have consistently demonstrated that so much of it can be avoided that the potatoes are nearly U. S. one after laying in storage until January and that the few potatoes that must be sorted out to make an especially good package are usually off-type, knobs or other such culls that are readily marketable because of their utility and keeping quality as number two grade. Proper attention at harvest, insuring good quality without too much expense of grading is important if putting up better quality is to show a profit. Unfortunately, there is very little incentive under present market conditions, to exercise the caution necessary to insure excellent quality, except for the producer of certified seed and most of the good care - ful growers in the Valley are now seeking compensation for their extra effort by certifying their potatoes. This year certified seed pro - duction was pretty thoroughly overdone. The same Is true of non - certifled seed potatoes. Every state producing the Triumph variety </seg>
            <seg id="p720">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE in the main crop sections, is making an effort to produce the very best of certified seed potatoes. Nearly every dealer, in all of these states has a brand under which he attempts to market the best of non-certifled potatoes. In no section, do we have any effort being put forth to de - velop. Identify through a brand, and protect the brand, on a quality table Triumph. The field is wide open. The grower who is not certifying his potatoes and who produces exceptional quality gets very little if any more for it than the grower with the ordinary commercial package. The reason for this is that the good package has been too much of an exception. The buyer can not convince his customer in some distant market, that he has potatoes out of Nebraska that are superior to the ordinary commercial or partly graded package so characteristic of most of our shipments Some - times a small premium can be secured, but the trade as a whole doesn't expect quality and will not pay a substantial premium. They buy their cheap potatoes in Nebraska and their premium potatoes elsewhere. Is it impossible to get a justifiable premium for high quality table stock if we produce it and protect it against competition from Inferior grades? We wrote to several of our seed customers who also bought Nebraska table stock last fall and received various kinds of replies A few of them were of the opinion that a good premium could be obtained provided the table stock was consistently good but that they had found it impossible to get a continuous supply of good quality table stock out of Nebraska. Others told us that their customers gave price. first consideration, that they wanted cheap potatoes, and they could not get any premium for the better graded stock because of cheaper prices on Nebraska potatoes offered by competitors. A very few expressed the opinion that they could sell a good brand of Ne - braska table Triumphs at a satisfactory premium. ! The proposition did not appear encouraging but we decided to experiment. It looked as though we had more certified seed than we could hope to sell at a premium and that some of It would have to be sold as table stock anyway. We adopted a brand and used all possible precaution to ship only the best of U. S. No. 1 grade potatoes under that brand. We arranged with a few customers to supply them with this brand. Some of them agreed to pay a nickle per hundred - weight premium. Others would pay no premium at all. We were optimistic enough to believe that if these customers just got one car of these potatoes, they would be more than willing to pay the premium on the next. We were disappointed. When repeat orders came in, we were unable to improve our price position. By the time we had supplied a third car to these customers at a slight premium or none at all, we were pretty thoroughly discouraged. We had not only been unable to pay the grower much of a premium </seg>
            <seg id="p721">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION for his potatoes, but we had not been able to get our cost out of the potatoes. We had donated the expense of hunting out, buying, super - vising grading, telegrams and other items incident to shipping. We decided to continue the business long enough to use up the sacks we had on hand, then abandon it. Right then, things began to happen. It seemed to take about three cars in a territory to get the final customer, the housewife, appreciating the product and demanding it. Our connections no longer objected to paying a premium and that premium gradually increased until in some instances we were not eve:, asked the price at which we would ship. No two potato years are alike. Our results this year must be considered purely experimental. We were not able to give the deal the time it deserved nor were we equipped to handle it to the best possible advantage. Plans had not been made ahead of time and we did not have a justifiable volume of business nor a steady supply. An occasional car was shipped that was not up to the high standard we had set and that would kill the advantage gained by previous ship - ments and take about two more cars at a small premium before the buyer's confidence was re-established. We selected only a few cus - tomers to distribute our potatoes but we could not keep them sup - plied. The proposition was an exploration into a new field. In spite of our mistakes, our hit and miss operation, our inability to keep a supply always available, we received some handsome premiums. One car sold for more than we comd possibly get for certified seed at the time. Several cars sold very close to the nremium Idaho potatoes. We feel encouraged. We believe that there is a demand for good quality, well graded table stock, and shipped under a brand that is protected, and that poor quality is never shipped under such a brand. It is first necessary to produce that quality. Triumphs are produced so that bin-run stock can easily be graded into a good package, and a well planned marketing program is followed, it seems quite certain that a premium can be secured for a superior grade of table stock marketed out of western Nebraska. PRACTICAL CROP ROTATIONS FOR IRRIGATION POTATO FARMERS LIONEL HARRIS Acting Superintendent, Scottsbluff Experiment Farm The favorable results of crop rotation are pretty generally known and enjoyed by at least the best potato growers.

            <seg id="p722">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE length. They have obtained higher yields and a better quality product from good crop rotation practices. A knowledge of the principles underlying crop rotation is the best argument or reason to justify and encourage the practice. These principles have been established as a result of an increased under- Standing of what takes place in plant growth. The early Romans observed a definitely favorable response in crops planted after Lupine, a legume, but were unable to explain the cause of the improvement. Since that time the chemical elements have been isolated and the im - portant part they play in plant growth has been determined. Bacteria capable of utilizing nitrogen from the vast reservoir in the air have been isolated. Certain of these bacteria have been found to be associ - ated with legume plants. Hence the importance of legumes in cropping systems. Other elements found to be most important in plant growth have been, phosphorus, calcium, iron, and potassium The soil is the only source of this plant food. Crops like alfalfa and sweet clover, which are deep rooted, bring up these elements from considerable depths, and when these crops are plowed under as green manure, a portion of this plant food is laid near the surface where it is available for shallower rooted crops. When green matter decays in the soil, acids are secreted which work on the soil particles breaking them down and liberating otherwise unavailable plant food. Green matter also serves as food for the great numbers of bacteria which are very essential in maintaining the soil in the best condition for plant growth. These are a few of the fundamental principles underlying the practice of crop rotation. Other benefits of crop rotation such as better distribution of labor, control of diseases, eliminating the risk connected with one crop farming, etc., are more obvious. A number of crop rotations have been in progress at the Scotts Bluff Substation for the past 24 years. I shall discuss several types of prac - tical rotations for potato farmers on the basis of these experiments. A good crop rotation includes more than one crop, and while emphasis may be placed on potatoes, yet all crops involved must be considered im - portant if the farmer is to achieve success in his complete farming operations. A good potato farmer is also a good alfalfa, corn, sugar beet, bean, hog, and dairy farmer. I shall first discuss some rotations which have been found to be definitely unprofitable. Planting potatoes on the same land every year cannot be recom - mended. The plot which has been cropped with potatoes for the last 24 years at the Scotts Bluff Substation is at the present time producing no marketable potatoes, and has not done so for a number of years. Good potato yields were obtained for the first few years after </seg>
            <seg id="p723">705 NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION the virgin sod was broken up in 1911, but since that time the yield has steadily declined. The same thing is true in general of the simple two or three year rotations where no alfalfa or sweet clover is grown or manure applied. In rotations where the yield of potatoes and all crops in the system, have been maintained or increased, manure has been applied or alfalfa or sweet clover has been grown in the cropping system. The chances of increasing the yields have been greatest where both treatments — applying manure and growing alfalfa or sweet clover — have been Involved. Omitting the results of the first six years (because the long rotations require 6 years) the data for the next 18 show the beneficial effect of manure and alfalfa in the following fig - ures: The 18-yr. average increase yield of potatoes due to manure was 105.0 bushels and to alfalfa 133.8 bushels. These are increases over yields obtained in rotations not receiving manure or growing alfalfa. For sugar beets the increase due to manure was 8.39 tons an acre and to alfalfa 5.63 tons. The figures for oats were 22.8 and 33.8 bushel* respectively. The increased yield of corn due to alfalfa was 24.7 bushels and the increase yield of wheat was 9.9 bushels. A good rotation for a potato farmer involves three important fea - tures: 1st — manure, 2nd — a legume crop, and 3rd — the proper length. From the standpoint of disease control the rotation cycle should include 5 or 6 years. Various types of rotations are being conducted at the Scotts Bluff Substation and the results of the following types may be of some value to potato growers with varied interests. Type 1. (Six year rotation) 24-year average yields 1 — Alfalfa seeded alone. 1.0 tons 2 — Alfalfa 4.8 tons 3 — Alfalfa 5.7 tons. 4 — Potatoes 316 bushels 5 — Oats 74 bushels. 6 — Beets Manure, 12 tons an acre 18.5 tons Type 2. (Six year rotation) 16-year average yields 1 — Oats-alfalfa 62 bushels 2 — Alfalfa 4.0 tons 3 — Alfalfa 5.3 tons 4— Alfalfa 5.3 tons 5 — Potatoes 327 bushels 6 — Beets 16 tons Type 3. (Seven year rotation) 1 — Oats-alfalfa 69 bushels 2 — Alfalfa 4.4 tons 3 — Alfalfa . 4.8 tons 4 — Alfalfa 5.0 tons </seg>
            <seg id="p724">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 5 — Potatoes 302 bushels 6 — Beets 15.3 tons 7 — Beets Manure, 12 tons an acre 17.9 tons Type 4 (four year rotation) i 0-year average yields 1 — Oats-sweet clover 59 bushels 2 — Sweet clover pasture with sheep 3 — Potatoes 348 Bushels 4 — Beets 15.8 tons Type 1 is a good 6-year rotation including both alfalfa and manure. Alfalfa is seeded alone. The advantages of this practice are that generally it is easier to obtain a stand, and the damage from grass - hopper attacks is less. In another rotation exactly like this one except that it receives no manure the yields of all crops are somewhat less. The 24-year average yield of potatoes has been 20 bushels less; of beets 4.5 tons less; of oats 5.0 bushels less; and of alfalfa 0.2 tons less. In another rotation in which neither manure or alfalfa are included the average yields of potatoes, beets and oats have been 132 bushels, 8.5 tons, and 28 bushels respectively, less than the yields shown in type 1. In a 3-year rotation which does not grow alfalfa but receives a yearly 12-ton application of manure the yields of potatoes, beets, and oats have been 56 bushels, 1 ton, and 8 bushels respectively, less than in type 1. ./.'.■ Type 2 is a six year rotation wherein alfalfa is seeded with oats as a nurse crop. The advantage of this is that good crops of alfalfa are obtained in three years whereas in type 1 good crops are harvested in only two years. A potato farmer who is also interested in dairy or sheep feeding will want to plant his alfalfa along with a grain crop and he may want to substitute corn for beets. A 12-ton applica - tion of manure on the beet crop is recommended for the practical application of this rotation. In planting alfalfa with grain as a nurse crop caution should be exercised regarding the time of planting. Grain crops may be planted considerably earlier than alfalfa without danger of frost injury. Alfalfa in the two leaf stage is sometimes damaged by severe late spring frosts. Type 3 is a 7-year rotation for a farmer who wants to grow a large acreage of beets and a moderate acreage of potatoes and grain. The 2nd year beets receives manure, and the effects of the manure can be noticed in the yield. The value of this rotation from the standpoint of the potato farmer who is troubled with diseases Is its length. Type 4 is a rotation including sweet clover as the legume crop in place of alfalfa. This rotation is valuable for a potato grower who is also interested in sheep. It produces no forage and consequently would not be practical in conjunction with a dairy. The sweet clover has maintained a good yield of potatoes, and the pasturing operation </seg>

Ewes bought in the fall and pastured together with their lambs the next spring and summer have in good years yielded a profit of from two to three dollars per head after charging twenty dollars per acre for pasture. As many as twelve ewes and their lambs per acre may be pastured on a good stand of sweet clover. , SEASONAL USES OP WATER BY POTATOES AND OTHER FARM CROPS UNDER IRRIGATION By LESLIE BOWEN, Assistant Irrigation Engineer, Bureau of Agricultural Engineering, United States Department of Agriculture. There are many factors which affect crop production. Lyon and Buckman in their text "The Nature and Properties of Soils," state that "productivity is a product of texture, structure, organic matter, mois - ture, available nutrients, soil reaction, weather, plant diseases, care of farmer, etc., etc." Some of these factors such as fertility, diseases, and moisture (under irrigation farming), are to a large extent under the control of man. Others, such as weather and climatic factors are not. Consequently about all one can do is to practice such methods of farm - ing as will be most favorable under existing conditions and be con - tented with such course as nature may follow. Volumes may be written on each of the above mentioned factors. For this paper we must confine ourselves to a brief discussion of mois - ture (such as may be supplied through irrigation and rain) and its effects. That moisture is essential to all life, all will agree. With plants, water is the common solvent of plant food, and it is by this medium that they obtain the necessary elements for growth. With the general run of farm crops there is considerable variation as to the period of use and the total amounts of water required for each. Numerous - are the factors affecting moisture requirement of plants and the rate - of use of moisture by plants. Only a few of the more important factors,, such as the soil, water supply, climate, and kind of crops, will be mentioned in this discussion. Soils. Perhaps the greatest single factor Influencing the water require - ment of the crop is the soil. Agriculturally, soils may be classified as organic or inorganic. Organic soils are those made by plant remains, such as the peats and mucks, while the inorganic soils are those made by the various minerals. In nature there is no such thing as complete </seg>
            <seg id="p726">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE uniformity of soil. Variations exist in depth, in size of particles, in compactness, permeability, amount of organic matter, and the position of the water table. Some soils such as the gravels and sands which -consist of coarse particles, are usually loosely compacted, and as a rule are highly permeable to water. Such soils as the clays and loams and finer grained soils, being more tightly compacted, are less permeable. Indeed, some of the clays are so tightly compacted as to be almost completely impermeable to water. The soil acts as a reservoir in which water is stored between irri - gations, for the use of the plants. Storage, or water-holding capacity of soils varies. The capacity per unit volume of coarse-grained soils, such as gravels and sands, is not as great as that of the finer-grained, heavier soils, such as the clays and loams, because of the smaller pro - portion of pore space between the coarse soil particles. Fine grained soil several feet deep may be slow to fill, but when filled it stores a large amount of water, while coarse-grained soil such as sands pro - vides little storage. In theory at least, water requirement for a crop grown on light sandy soil should be no greater than if it were grown in a heavy clay. However, on sandy soil more water is applied and the waste is larger because of greater soil permeability. Sandy soils soon fill, and when too much water is applied the excess drains downward beyond the root zone of plants. On the lighter and more porous soils, as sands and gravels, it is advisable to make light frequent irrigations, in the interest of econ - omy of water. So as to wet the soils rapidly, runs should be short and streams as large as the topography will accommodate. With the heavier soils, runs can be longer and applications can be heavier but less frequent. The position of the water table controls to a large extent the man - agement of irrigation. Very frequent are the cases where the produc - tivity of the soil has decreased from year to year because of a gradual rise of the ground water and the accumulation of alkali salts. Many are the instances — and we have them in this valley — where farms highly productive in the early stage of irrigation development are now reduced to water-logged areas, supporting chiefly cat-tails, bull rushes, tules, and other water-loving plants. Because of their muckiness many acres in such areas are scarcely good even for pastures. •Climate. Hot, dry climates, with long seasons of growth, require consider - ably more water for crop production than is necessary where the cli - mate is more temperate and the growing season shorter. </seg>
            <seg id="p727">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION Water supply and method of delivery. In areas with an abundance of water there is a tendency on the part of the users to pay little attention to the amount of irrigation water applied. This results in excessive irrigation of many acres. Then too, as a rule, where delivery to the various farms is made by small streams of continuous flow, there is a likelihood of greater water waste, than if delivery on a rotation basis is followed. The economy and effects of rotation upon greater crop production were very pronounced in the Platte Valley during the dry years 1934 and 1935. Indeed, through these two seasons the practices employed in the management and distribution of water and the results obtained proved what could be accomplished with a limited supply of water when managed properly. Kind of crop and stage of development. Crops differ not only in their total seasonal water requirements, but also in their requirements as to time and frequency of application. The farmer who grows only grain needs large quantities of water for short periods, usually during June and early July, and then he has no further use for water until the next season. Likewise, the farmer who grows only beets or potatoes needs large amounts, but later in the season. With alfalfa, heavy uses are made through the season if the crop is to produce its yearly maximum. By diversification of crops it is possible to reduce the peak demands for water on any particular project. The water "uses" or requirements for alfalfa, oats, sugar beets, and potatoes, as determined by studies made during the past four years, are shown in figure 1. In these graphs are shown both total seasonal use and the depth from which the water was taken. The seasonal use curves for beets and alfalfa show irregularities. The depressed segments are undoubtedly attributable to some unusual condition, such as disease, defoliation, or insufficient moisture. With beets, during three of the past four years we have had leaf spot, a dis - ease affecting the leaves of the plants. The effects of this disease are most apparent during the month of August. This disease together with insufficient moisture undoubtedly is the cause of the depression in the curve of seasonal uses for the beets. With the alfalfa, defolia - tion, or cutting of the crop, and shortage of moisture are perhaps the cause for the drop in this curse. Technically, if crop cuttings were made on the same date and moisture was available at all times each year, there should be three distinct peaks showing in the alfalfa. Because of the effects of drought and other causes the third growth peak was apparently ironed out and consequently does not show. </seg>

            <seg id="p729">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION • Under irrigation farming the type of : soil should govern the ■quantity of water applied at any single irrigation, while the kind of crop and its stage of growth, climate, and availability of water will govern the frequency. Since soils vary greatly in their capacity to hold water, irrigation practice should vary somewhat. The sandy soils, such as those comprising the bench land in the North Platte Valley, will hold, as a maximum following irrigation, some 3.4 inches of avail - able water in the upper 2 feet. In the upper 4 feet some 8 inches can be stored. These figures represent all water between the lower limit wilting point and the upper limit field capacity. In actual farming practice it is not advisable to permit the mois - ture to become depleted to the wilting point, as such a depletion will naturally retard growth. A better practice would be to irrigate at times when there is at least % inch of water available for each foot of depth. Allowing only % inch of available water for each foot, then by irrigation we should apply to the surface 2 feet some 3.4 minus 1, or 2.4 inches. Likewise in the upper 4 feet, by irrigation we should apply some 8 minus 2 or 6 inches. Under furrow irrigation, water enters the soil at the rate of about 1.4 inches per hour for potatoes and about 1.6 inches per hour for beets. Lateral movement is slow and consequently a large proportion of the water goes downward. When flood irrigation is practiced, this rate increases to about 3.5 inches per hour. From the graphs indicating the depths from which the moisture Is extracted, it is seen that the greatest moisture changes occur in the upper two or three feet of soil. With all crops except alfalfa, fully 8 0 to 90 per cent of the total water used is taken from the upper three feet. It is the opinion of the writer that if the upper three feet of soil is filled with water at each irrigation there will be sufficient down-drainage of moisture from this upper stratum to supply the plant wants at the lower depth. Consequently it is not necessary to fill the «ntire soil mass 4, 6, or even 9 feet deep, as has sometimes been done. To keep moisture in the upper stratum,— the zone where plants ex - tract the most water — implies that irrigation should be light and frequent. Under flood irrigation this is comparatively simple. With tow crops, the task is more difficult. Seemingly with row crops, especially with potatoes where deep furrows are used, there is exces - sive pentration downward, long before the surface foot is properly wet. Slow lateral, movement together with the deep furrows between rows is undoubtedly the cause of this action. There is not much we can do to hasten the lateral movement, but it may be that by decreasing the ■depth or increasing the number of furrows, or by a combination of the two measures, we could better control the moisture spread in the surface layer, and greatly reduce the losses due to excessive percolation. </seg>
            <seg id="p730">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Measurement of irrigation water. So as to assist the farmer or the water user to know the quantity of water being used during an irrigation, or for how long a time a given stream should be run so as to supply a stipulated quantity, he should have a knowledge of the terms commonly referred to in measurement of water. Water may be measured while it is in motion or while it is at rest. If the measurement is made while the water is at rest, as in tanks, reservoirs, and lakes, units of volume, as acre-feet, acre-inches, gallons, or cubic feet are used. If the measurement is made while the water is in motion, as in rivers, canals, ditches, pipe lines, or flumes, units expressing rates of flow, as cubic feet per second, gallons per minute, acre-feet per day, and acre-inches per hour, are used. The following are definitions of a few common terms: Acre-foot — The volume of water sufficient to cover an acre 1 foot deep. It equals 43,560 cubic feet; Acre-inch — The volume of water sufficient to cover an acre 1 inch deep. It is equal to 3,630 cubic feet or one-twelfth acre-foot; Cubic-foot per second (c.f.s.) — The equivalent of a stream 1 foot wide and 1 foot deep, flowing at the rate of 1 foot per second; Gallon per minute — The equivalent of a stream which would fill a gallon measure once each minute of time. In the discussion of water problems it is frequently necessary to - change from units of storage to units of flow or vice versa. Since there is a definite relation between these units we may indicate some - of those most commonly used: One cubic foot per second (c.f.s. = 7.48 gallons per second, or = 448.8 (approx. 450) gallons per minute; One cubic foot per second =3600 cubic feet per hour = .992 (approx. 1) acre-inch per hr.; One cubic foot per second =1.9834 (approx. 2) acre-feet per per 24-hour day. To exemplify the usage of the above terms and conversion units a few problems involving their use are given: Problem 1. How long a time will it take to apply a 6-inch irrigation uniformly spread over a 15-acre tract of. alfalfa, if the size of stream used is 3 cubic feet per second? Solution. The total water required is 15x6 = 90 acre-inches. A stream of 3 c.f.s. = 3 acre-inches per hour. The time required is 90 divided by 3 = 30 hours. Problem 2. Brown has a pump which discharges 450 gallons per minute. If he spends 2 days (48 hours) in irrigating 10 acres of po - tatoes, what average depth in inches does he apply to each acre? </seg>
            <seg id="p731">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION Solution. 450 g.p.m. = l c.f.s. = about 1 acre-inch per hour. The total water applied equals 48x1 = 48 acre-inches. Since the water is spread over 10 acres, we have 48 divided by 10, or some 4.8 inches upon each* acre. Problem 8. How much land will a continuous flow of 2 5 c f s 5 mODths if each acre must nave an average depth of Solution. 1 c.f.s. = about 2 acre-feet per day 2.5 c.f.s. = 2x2.5 or 5 acre-feet per day. 5 months at 30 days per month = 150 days. Total days times rate per day = total supplied, therefore (150x5 = 750 acre-feet). Depth on each acre is to be 2 feet. Then 750 divided by 2 or 3 75 eriod "" er of aeres covered b y this 2.5 c.f.s. in the 5 month In this area, (the Scotts Bluff district) under the government ditches, irrigation water is usually measured to the farmers by means of trapezoidal-shaped weirs. These weirs, for the most part, have 2 foot crest lengths. Streams of water are frequently referred to by farmers as gauge readings on the weirs. To reduce these gauge read - ings to streams of cubic feet per second (c.f.s.) and the equivalent depth in acre-inches, Table 2 should be of assistance. Values shown in this table are based on the following formula: 1 x t d = depth of water in inches o. — — where cj = size of head in c.f.s. A . A = area in acres t = time in hours. </seg>

O. WERNER, Department of Horticulture University ot Nebraska During the last six years the mean annual yields ot the 36 crop - rotation plats at the Box Butte Farm 1 have varied from 21.1 bushels per acre to 260.3 bushels with a six year mean of 110.0. If the yields of 1930 are omitted from comparisons, because the previous crop was the same (corn) in all plats, and because yields were extraordinarily high the annual means ranged from 21.1 to 128.2 bushels per acre, with a five year mean of 80.4 bushels. (Table 1). Relation of time and amount of rainfall to yield. The highest yields were produced in 1930 when the precipitation occurring before planting was the heaviest recorded for these 6 years. This was followed by a very heavy, well-distributed rainfall during the growing season (Table 2). In 1930 there was no cumulative soil moisture deficit, the effective precipitation during the twelve months prior to planting having been 18.3 inches, considerably above the average for these six years (column 2+ column 8 of Table 2). The lowest yields in all crop treatments were secured in the drouth year of 1934, when the average total yield was only 21.1 bushels with NO crop in some plats. That year the total effective rainfall prior to and during the crop season was only 6.36 inches (Table 2, Column 7). (Effective rainfall is figured here as not less than 0.25 inch of rain in one day or two consecutive days.) In 1935 the pre-planting precipitation was about the same as that prior to the 1932 crop period (the second lowest year). The 1934 yields were disastrously low be - cause there was no effective precipitation during the entire growing season after June 16th except for one rain of 0.52 inch on August 10th. As a result of this drouth and the unusually high temperatures the scant moisture was quickly exhausted and in most plats the plants made no top or tuber growth after the early part of August. The 1933 crop was slightly above what might be considered a good average crop In this locality and yields were second highest for the six year period.

This was apparently due to the lack of any effective rainfall from planting time till September 1 in " 35 ;^:' n 1933&gt; aUhOUgh there Was no effective ral^all from May 24th till August 1st, a very timely rain of 0.79 inch on August 1. supplemented by another of 3.12 inches on August 26-28 and 0 76 inch on September 12, saved the situation and a good crop was pro - duced. The late August rains came so rapidly in 1933 that "run-off" was excessive and the accompanying hail seriously retarded the plant growth; a smaller amount of rain coming more slowly at this time would undoubtedly have resulted in increasing yields more than did these August downpours. Undoubtedly the yield of the 1930 crop was greater than that of 1933 because there was more August and September rain that came in such a way that it could soak into the ground and also because soil moisture conditions at planting time were somewhat better. The crop of 1931 was less than that of 1933, probably because of ess pre-planting precipitation and less summer rainfall. Although he early summer drouth period started about three weeks later in S^en^er £2£' " C ° ntinUed "" AUgUSt 6 ' *™ «" The relation between rainfall at various seasons and crop yields may be summarized as follows: The rainfall from the previous fall to planting time seems to have been of prime importance in the production of high yields of potatoes, as shown in the 1933 season. Crop produc - tion possibilities were still further enhanced if an additional two to f ™ ° f precIpltatlon o^urred during late July and early August as in 1930. If a large amount of rain fell before planting time an average crop could be produced without any rainfall of consequence during the growing season, as in 1935. However, slightly better yields were produced in another season when total soil moisture content at Planting time was much less but moisture was supplied at the crucial time in early August (1931). Crops were very unsatisfactory when there was a shortage of rainfall before planting time as in 1932 and if under such circumstances, rain did not occur in July or August as in 1934, the crop was practically a failure. In two of the six years (1932-1934) the lack of rainfall during the previous growing season was undoubtedly a factor in causing low yields, because the soil moisture was then more thoroughly depleted than in other years and it was not replaced before potatoes were planted. When spring rainfall was heavy, as in 1935, the drouth of the previous year was not an important factor. </seg>

The potato yields in the season of 1934 serve admirably to illustrate this relation. From October 1, 1933, to May 31, 1934, the effective precipitation was only 4.13 inches. It is not likely that all of this precipitation soaked into the soil, for 2.88 inches fell as snow in December and January and a considerable Table 3.

During the previous growing season (June 1 to Sept. 30, 1933) the effective precipitation was 4.97 inches, which was only about an average amount, and most of this fell in two torrential rains and the run-off was excessive. In 1934 there was a light rain of 0.44 inch on June 5th, only one week before planting, and another of 1.25 inches four days after planting. As a result of this very timely precipitation excellent stands resulted In all plats. However, the amount of moisture in the soil at planting time was: actually not very great. It varied considerably in the different rotation plats because of the effect of the previous crops on the moisture carry - over. After the early June rain the surface foot of the soil contained only one-third to one-half of the moisture it was capable of holding where potatoes followed wheat. The second foot contained still less and below that the soil was dry, so far as water available for crop production was concerned. Two days after the mid-June rain of 1 25 inches, and about one week before most of the potato plants emerged the available moisture in the top foot of the plats following wheat was increased to about 75 per cent of its available field' capacity and the second foot to about 4 0 per cent, but below that there was little if any difference. The top five feet averaged only 30 per cent of the water it was capable of holding (Table 4, column 10). The situation was somewhat better in the plats following corn and still better following fallow. In the plats following corn the top foot contained almost as much as it could hold, the second foot had over 50 per cent of its capacity, and the third foot little less. The 4 th and 5th feet contained only 30 to 35 per cent of their capacity in fields 1 and 2 but 62 to 74 per cent in Field 3. The top five feet of soil in the plats in the rotation where corn had been grown in 1929 and 1933 was filled to 54.6 per cent of capacity (Column 1. Table 4) and where corn had been grown in 1929, 1931, and 1933 it was up to 56 1 per cent of its capacity (Column 12). In the plats following fallow the mid-June rainfall could not percolate as rapidly as in the other plats, because there was less unoccupied space in the various soil levels! Consequently on June 18th there was still some free water in the top foot, which by a day or two later would have soaked into the second foot (Column 12). All five feet of the fallow plat contained more moisture than similar levels in any of the other plats. The average of the top five feet in the three fields showed that they contained 72.4 per cent of the moisture they were capable of holding. </seg>

The very definite nature of this correlation is brought out </seg>
            <seg id="p740">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE by the graph In Figure 1. The yields were lowest following wheat, next lowest following corn where there had been only one corn crop, and second highest where there were two corn crops in the rotation. After fallow the yields very distinctly higher than any others (Column 7, Table 2). Disappearance of Soil Moisture During the Crop Season The crop seasons of 1934 and 1935 were excellent ones in which to study the disappearance of moisture from the soil. In both years there was little rainfall during the growing season. In 1934 there was little rainfall prior to planting and the soil moisture content varied considerably as a result of the previous crop in the rotation. In 1935 the copious spring rains almost equalized the moisture content of all plats. Season of 1034 When potatoes followed wheat (Rotation 52) practically all avail - able moisture was withdrawn from the top two feet prior to August 6, 1934 (Fig. 2). This meant that almost all available moisture in this plat was gone for at the beginning of the growing season there 1 was practically no available moisture in the 3rd, 4th, and 5th feet. The rain of 0.52 inch on August 10th arrived after a, prolonged drouth just in time to prevent the death of the potato plants. This prolonged the life of the plants till September 1st, when a rain of 0.3 inch supplied some moisture to the top foot and maintained the life of most of the plants a few days more. The potato plants in these plats were very small. In Field 1, where the yield in this rotation was 5 bushels, there was more moisture thruout the season than in the other fields. The water that disappeared from these plats during the growing season amounted to 72 per cent of the total amount stored at the beginning :of the season (Table 6, Column 2). When corn preceded potatoes (Rotations 51 and 54) there was more moisturein the top two feet of soil than following wheat (Table 4, Columns 2, 3, 4). In the 3rd, 4th, and 5th feet, in which there was practically no moisture following wheat, there was a considerable amount following corn. The moisture in the soil in these lower levels . amounted to about one-third of the field moisture holding capacity, except in Field 3, where it was up to about two-thirds of the capacity (Columns 11 and 12, Table 4). Although moisture disappeared very quickly from the top foot, it did not disappear as rapidly or completely as following wheat and was removed even less rapidly out of the second foot (Fig. 2). The moisture in the third foot remained practically undisturbed till July 23rd, but between then and August 6th about half of the available moisture was withdrawn from both the second and third feet. From August 6th to 20th little moisture was removed </seg>

By late August much of the foliage of the plants in these rotations had been damaged by the excessively hot, dry winds and apparently other irreparable damage had been done to the plants .as they removed relatively little moisture from the soil during early September.

At the end of the crop season most of the moisture was found to have been removed from the top four feet of soil and very much from the fifth foot (Fig. 5, Table 5). The potatoes apparently removed most of the moisture in the top five feet of most plats. </seg>

Moisture Necessary for Potato Production It is of interest to note that during the season of 1934 the average total amount of water used by potatoes, figured as inches of rainfall, ranged from 2.45 inches following wheat to 3.28 and 3.52 following corn and 4.14 inches following fallow (Table 6) and of this only 0.52 inch fell during the crop season. The water calculated as lost from twelve of the potato plats in the five-year rotations in 1935 was 6.29 inches, of which 1.39 inch fell during the growing season. In 1934 the average yield following corn in the five-year plats was 25.6 bushels, while in 1935 it was 91.4 bushels, or a difference of 65.8 bushels per acre. In 1934 at plant emergence time the soil contained about 4.33 inches of water, while in 1935 it contained about 7.7 inches or about 56 per cent and 100 per cent of the water-holding capacity (based on estimates shown in Table 3) In 1934 a total of about 3.4 inches of water disappeared from the soil, in comparison with about 6.07 inches in 1935. While errors may result from attempts to apply, a mathematical formula to processes that are subject to as many variable factors as is a growing potato plant, a few calculations may be of casual interest in trying to determine the ratio between an inch of water used by the potatoes (or lost from the soil) and the crop of tubers in bushels per acre. Practically no tubers were produced when only about 2.3 inches of water were used (Rotation 52, Tables 1 and 6). By deduct - ing that amount from the total used out of the six plats following corn, there was left a net amount of 1.1 inches with which the 25.6 </seg>
            <seg id="p746">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE bushels of potatoes were produced in 1934 (average of Rotations 51 ■and 54, Table 1). Deducting the same 2.4 inches from the 6.4 inches used in 1935, there remained 4.0 inches, with which 99.8 bushels of potatoes were produced. Consequently for each inch of moisture used, in excess of that arbitrarily estimated to be necessary to grow the vegetative portions, 23.3 bushels of potatoes were produced in 1934 and 25.0 bushels in 1935. EFFKCT OP PRECEDING CROP Five Year Rotations In three out of the five years, the highest average yields were secured when potatoes followed corn (Rotation 51, where corn occurred twice). In one year the highest yields followed summer fallow and in the other year they followed small grain. Lowest yields were produced after small grain in four out of five years. (Table 2). The low yields following small grain were undoubtedly the result of the more or less complete depletion of the soil moisture by the small grain and weeds following. The high yield of potatoes following small grain in 1935 is explained as follows: In the spring of 1935 the soil in all plats was practically filled to field capacity by the heavy spring rains, so that any previous soil moisture differences were thus eliminated. Furthermore, as a result of the severe and prolonged winds and dust storms during the entire winter, much soil was blown off the fallow and corn plats, and these plats were seriously robbed of the most valuable surface soil, much of which was stopped in the small-grain stubble, thus increasing the fertility of such plats. The very rank and dark green growth of spring grain wherever soil had been piled up, in contrast with poor growth and poor color where some had been removed by blowing, was very strong evidence of this transfer of fertile soil. The depressing effect of small grain upon succeeding potato crops was greatest when the previous season was very dry and spring rain - fall was light (1932, 1934). The yield of potatoes following small grain was generally more dependent upon pre-planting rainfall than when following any other crop. For example, in 1933 and 1935 when pre-planting precipitation was greatest, the yields following small grain were very good, and in 1931 when it was intermediate in amount the yields were definitely depressed. A contributing factor to the rela - tively low yields after small grain in 1931 was the plowing under and. decomposition of the very heavy wheat 1 stubble produced in 1930. With a seven-week rainless period following the planting of the 1931 crop, the decomposition of this straw undoubtedly brought about un - desirable moisture and fertility complications. </seg>
            <seg id="p747">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION Following corn, in the five-year rotation during which corn oc - curs twice (51), the yield of potatoes was greater than following summer fallow (53) in four out of five years. But when corn was grown only one year out of five (54) the yield following fallow was always greatest. During the earlier years the fallow land was not kept absolutely free of weeds; consequently there was some dissipa - tion of moisture, which may have been almost as great as that by a corn crop, and there also was a somewhat greater loss of surface soil from fallow land due to blowing. However, it is not likely that these two factors were the sole cause of the reduced yields. A dominant factor was subsoil moisture storage. In 1933 when yields after fallow were less than those after corn in Fields 2 and 3, the percentage of moisture was less than after corn (Rotation 51), especially in the deep subsoil. However, in Field 1, where the yield after fallow was greatest, the subsoil moisture was also greatest. In 1934 when yields after fallow were always highest, the soil moisture content was also higher, with least difference in Field 3, where yield differences were also least. Then in 1935, although the soil moisture content after fallow was greatest, the yield after fallow was greatest only in Field 1. Quite likely this slightly lower yield after fallow plats in spite of higher soil moisture content was the result of loss of fertile surface soil by blowing. Potato yields in the five-year rotation with only one year of corn were less than after fallow in four out of five years. During seasons of ample moisture there was little gained by fallow - ing or planting after corn, but if the season was a dry one, especially if preceded by another dry one, then fallowing or clean cultivation was a very desirable practice. When considering the relatively small dif - ference between the yields in the two rotations where corn preceded potatoes and where fallow was used, and the much greater yield than following small grain, it seems that growing potatoes after clean - cultivated corn is a very practical procedure. In view of the difficulty of maintaining organic matter in dryland soils, an attempt is being made to use sweet clover. Because of the probability of getting poor stands of potatoes following sweet clover in dry seasons, rotations have been included which provide for potatoes to follow sweet clover in one rotation and in another to have a corn crop between. Not much is lost in the way of cost of seed and labor of seeding if the land is too dry for corn and in that event the corn plat will practically be a fallow plot. With potatoes directly after sweet clover, yields of potatoes were less than after small grain in two years, higher in two years, and complete failure after both crops in one year. There was about the same amount of soil moisture at planting time in 1933 in the top two feet as after small grain, but generally there was less in the fourth </seg>
            <seg id="p748">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE and fifth feet. Thus far this has been as poor a procedure as planting potatoes after small grain. When a crop of corn was planted after two years of sweet clover, yields were better than directly after either sweet clover or small grain but lower than after corn, except in 1935 when this was the lowest producing of all the five-year rotations. This reversal in 1935 was probably due to Russian thistles having crowded into this plat in 1933, when sweet clover died out. This growth of thistles, (even though they were clipped) exhausted the soil moisture which was not replenished when corn occupied the land in 1934. As a result of the failure to get a stand of clover in 1933 and again in 1934 the land was fallow during much of 1934, thus accounting for the high yield in 1935 when potatoes supposedly followed sweet clover directly. In 1933 the soil moisture seemed to be a little higher at planting time in the sweet clover-corn rotation than in the sweet clover rotation, but much less than in the other corn rotations. During these five. years the con - ditions have quite generally been unfavorable for these sweet clover rotations. The results indicate that the use of sweet clover is hazard - ous in most seasons because of the dissipation of soil moisture. More time will be required to determine whether the expected maintenance of organic matter will be realized and whether it will render this a desirable cropping sequence. Three-Tear Rotations In three-year crop rotations potatoes yielded more following corn than following small grain, in four of the five years. The one excep - tion occurred in 1935 in spite of the greater soil moisture following corn than following small grain. The blowing of soil from the corn to the grain stubble is very probably the reason for this divergence. From the standpoint of total yield this rotation has been more produc - tive than the five-year rotation with one year of corn but less produc - tive than the one with two years of corn. The yield following beans has generally been between that of the plats following corn and those following small grain. All these facts suggest that the yields were increased as the frequency of cultivated crops was increased. These short rotations have been found undesirable because of the increased prevalence of scab and fusarium on the tubers. When sweet clover was used in two years of a three-year rotation, yields were less than following corn or beans and generally less than in the five-year sweet-clover rotations. When potatoes were planted on the same plats each year, yields were less than following corn and beans but frequently higher than </seg>
            <seg id="p749">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION following small grain or sweet clover. However, this practice is entirely impractical because of the prevalence of soil-borne disease. Concluding Discussion The experimentation of the last six years at the Box Butte farm seems to show that a very satisfactory crop of potatoes can be produced on dry land with moisture stored in the soil, without any rainfall after planting. Apparently 1.5 inches of stored moisture is needed before the potato can produce any tubers, but 5 or 6 inches of stored moisture has produced a fair to good crop, and 7 to 8 inches (about all the soil can store in the top five feet) an average crop. In general the size of the crop in dry years has been directly dependent upon the amount of moisture stored in the soil. Rainfall prior to planting is one of the most important factors influencing potato yields and is of utmost im - portance in view of the uncertainty of the summer rainfall. When preplanting rainfall was low and there was some summer rainfall (as in 1932) there was less chance for a crop than when stored moisture was higher and summer rainfall was low (as in 1935). After dry years more soil moisture was found in summer-fallowed land than following corn. There was practically no available moisture (especially below two feet) following wheat. With heavy spring rains these differences were largely wiped out. In dry seasons potatoes used water from the upper foot or foot and a half during July, drawing upon the lower part of the second and third and sometimes on the fourth foot during August. In September they depended almost entirely upon the remaining moisture in the third foot, and in addition practically exhausted the fourth foot and drew heavily on the fifth foot of soil. Relatively less moisture was withdrawn from the upper soil levels if a supply of moisture was available in the third, fourth, and fifth foot than when these lower levels were dry. </seg>

If you have the whooping cough, or collide with your neighbor's car, or wish to build a house, or get elected to office, I can - not help you. As a matter of course, you would not ask me to serve you in any of these fields because in most lines of endeavor you are accustomed to being served by specialists. I am an economist, and in my discussion of the topic which has been assigned me, I shall endeavor to give you the viewpoint that is held by economists as a group and not the viewpoint of physicians, or lawyers, or engineers, or politicians. I make no claim for originality of either ideas or method of presentation. I shall merely state as con - cisely as I can some of the ideas upon the production of wealth which are almost universally held by economists. "Wealth consists of all useful, material things owned by human beings."* Our wealth consists, then, of houses, factories, railroads, paved streets, automobiles, land, livestock, furniture, clothing, and thousands of other things that someone owns and finds useful. The more of these useful goods that a nation owns, the greater is its wealth, and the more that it owns in proportion to its population, the greater its prosperity. The United States has long been considered a wealthy nation. Even in this year of depression the 7 per cent of the population of the world who live in the United States own about 72 per cent of the total supply of automobiles, about 60 per cent of the telephones, about 33 per cent of the railway mileage and so large a part of such labor saving devices as mechanical refrigerators and power washing machines that it seems unduly boastful even to talk about them. The reasons for the rapid development of the United States as a nation and the rapid increase in material wealth should be known by every school boy. We live in a country which has great natural resources. Not all our soil is equally productive, but nowhere else in the world is that as large an area of fertile land now being cropped as that which lies in the Mississippi-Missouri-Ohio valley. The climate is healthful and we can produce an abundance of food and fibre crops to supply all our needs, and an additional surplus to send to the people of foreign countries in exchange for some of their products which they produce more economically than they can be produced in the United States. * Fairchild, Furniss, Buck. Elementary Economics, Vol. 1, p. 12. </seg>
            <seg id="p751">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION ■ We had originally great forest resources and in spite of our pro - fligate dissipation of our forests, probably enough timber is standing to supply the nation's needs during your lifetime and mine. We have an abundance of coal, iron, copper, aluminum, zinc, and lead. We have a large amount of waterpower as yet but partially developed. These vast resources were here long before John Cabot sailed along our Eastern coast, or DeSoto discovered the Mississippi, or Coronado travelled across plains and mountains in search of treasure. The people of the United States are far wealthier than the Indians ever were because we have made a better utilization of our natural re - sources. Perhaps no country ever exploited its resources as rapidly as has the United States. In the years before the beginning of our present depression the United States produced about 48 per cent of the world supply of copper, 52 per cent of the pig iron, 35 per cent of the lead, 35 per cent of the coal, 67 per cent of the petroleum, 19 per cent of the wheat, 58 per cent of the corn, and 56 per cent of the cotton. Because the United States has produced a large volume of useful goods it has become a wealthy nation. The rapid exploitation rests primarily upon four things — industry, thrift, science, and invention. These four things are determined quite largely by the natural characteristics — by the ideas and ideals of the people who left home and fatherland to make a home in a new world. Most of the men and women who emigrated to the English colonies and those who came to the United States in later years were indus - trious. They were not afraid to work. They wished to better their condition, to provide confortable homes, and to secure an abundance of the good things of life. The men and women who developed America spent! 1 little time discussing such topics as a 30 hour week or old age pensions. They were busy producing in order that all might possess abundance. The word thrift does not imply either parsimoniousness or the hoarding of money. Nearly all persons spend the greater part of their money income, and the thrifty person may spend almost as rapidly as the thriftless. The difference between the thrifty and the thrift - less is not so much in the time of spending the income as in the wisdom with which it is spent and the ability with which property, or business, or time is managed. ' Economists talk about producers' goods and consumers goods. Food, amusements, liquor, and tobacco are typically consumers' goods. They can be used but once, because they are consumed by use. A factory building and its equipment, a carpenter's tools, and the ma - chinery on a farm are producers' goods. They are used to produce food, clothing, shelter and other things to supply our needs. All pro - ducers' goods represent an accumulation of capital. </seg>
            <seg id="p752">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE A thrifty person spends a part of his income either directly or indirectly for producers' goods. He may buy new equipment for his farm or factory which is a direct purchase, or he may invest in a bond issued by some company which requires additional capital in order to enlarge its plant and thus become an Indirect purchaser. When the thrifty person buys consumers' goods he considers service and durability. Whether his investment is direct or Indirect, he has increased the production of goods by increasing the capital used in production. Thriftless persons are usually interested in the immediate present and spend their income as rapidly as it is received for food, clothing, shelter, and amusements. Since the advent of installment buying and other forms of easy credit they often follow the practice of spending their income before it is received. Our Puritan ancestors were as thrifty as they were industrious. They not only worked hard but they spent wisely and managed ably. They built comfortable houses and barns and increased the size of their fields and the numbers of their livestock. They accumulated capital and kept the capital at work. The Dutch settlers in New York and many of the emigrants who came later from Scotland, Germany, Denmark, and other countries were fully as thrifty as the Puritans. The accumulation of capital depends upon thrift. If every person spent his entire income for the pleasures of the day there could be no material advancement. Without thrift there would be no new factories, or equipment, or homes, or highways, or orchards. Someone must postpone consumption of income, in order to provide for future needs, or in the hope of increasing his total income. Thrifty persons are a benefit to a community or a nation. They accumulate the capital that is needed in industry. Their capital provides employment for many persons and enables the thriftless as well as the thrifty to enjoy the comforts and conveniences of present day civilization. The people of the United States have utilized science to increase pro - duction and provide comforts and conveniences which were unknown a century ago. In the agricultural field, the intelligent application of science has enabled us to decrease the cost of producing crops and livestock. We know something about how to control such fungus diseases as potato scab, cedar rust, and ergot. We are also controlling such livestock diseases as black-leg and hog cholera. We have learned how to decrease losses caused by such insects and animal parasites as the codling moth, round worm, and Colorado potato beetle. We have learned many things about the feeding and care of livestock. Animal breeders have given us hogs and cattle that mature more rapidly than their ancestors of 100 years ago and have increased the productivity of our dairy cows. Because of the scientific knowledge and painstaking </seg>
            <seg id="p753">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION care of our plant breeders, we have new and improved varieties of apples, wheat, corn, and many other plants. Invention has proceeded hand in hand with science. Edison gave us the incandescent light, but his invention would not have been possible without his scientific information of electricity. The inventors who have given us the automobile, the steam engine, the grain binder, the mower, the linotype, and the thousands of other labor saving inven - tions have known something of the science or sciences upon which their inventions rest. Because of the extensive use that we make of labor saving machinery, an American working man produces more In a day on the average than a working man in any other country. Science and invention are alike dependent upon education. Our free high school system has been responsible to a greater extent than any other one factor for the development of these two great forces for progress. Without education we would have made little progress in either science or invention. A larger percentage of the youth of the United States are attending high school and college than in any European nation. Not all will become either scientists or inventors, but those who are interested In either of these great fields will have the opportunity to carry on. We are training the men and women of tomorrow who will keep America at the front of progress. If a nation would be wealthy, it must produce abundantly. In order that everyone may have an abundance of the good' things of life, those things must first be produced and then the products which each group produces must be exchanged for the products produced by other groups. The National Bureau of Economic Research has reasonably accurate data upon total national income and upon the income of various groups. The Brookings Institution has recently published two books, America's Capacity to Produce, and America's Capacity to Consume, which furnish additional information. We look back upon 1928 and 1929 as years when most people who really wanted to work were employed. Our national income in those years was the greatest it has ever been. If we include not only the money income which men received, but the imputed income which came from the ownership of homes and from the value of home grown products used in the home, the average per capita annual income for the total population of the United States was about $740 in 1929. This includes wages, rent, interest, profits, fees, and income from every other conceivable source. Most of the persons who fear general over-production assume that </seg>
            <seg id="p754">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE the productive equipment of the United States is only partially utilized ! and that if it were fully utilized it would be possible to produce more commodities than could be used. The truth is that the production possible in 1929 if all equipment had been fully utilized was only about 19 per cent greater than was actually produced. As a matter of course, complete utilization of all equipment is impossible. If meat packing establishments are equipped to handle all the hogs that come to market in December and January, it is obvious that the equipment will be only partly utilized in July and August when fewer hogs are i sent to market. Similar examples, can be cited for nearly all indus - tries. Even if complete utilization of productive equipment were pos - sible the addition to the income would not represent any great abundance. The Brookings Institution estimates that in 1929 there were 11, - 653,000 families with annual incomes under $1500 and 9,893,000 families with incomes from $1500 to $3000. The next group com - prised 3,672,000 families in moderate circumstances with incomes from $3,000 to $5,000. There were 1,625,000 families with incomes from $5000 to $10,000; 471,000 families with incomes of $10,000 to $25,000 and 160,000 families with incomes of $25,000 or more. 1 More than 78 per cent of the families of the United States had incomes I of $3,000 or less in the year of our greatest prosperity. The average ! income of these 21,546,000 families was only $1,433. If each of the families could have increased its consumptive expenditures by $1000, it would have amounted to over $21,000,000,000 and would have ex - ! ceeded our productive capacity. The suggestion is sometimes made that the real trouble is unequal distribution of income rather than too little income. Probably every one will admit that the distribution of income is not entirely in accord - ance with the value of services performed, but merely equalizing income will not solve the present problem. If all income in excess of $3000 had been taken from the families having incomes of more than that amount in 19 29 and distributed among the families having incomes of less than $3000, the average income of these lower income groups would have been only $2,183. The fact of the matter is that we have never produced an abundance of all kinds of goods in the United States. We have produced, in some years, enough wheat, pork, corn, and cotton to satisfy all reasonable needs, but we have never produced sufficient paint, bath tubs, electric refrigerators, two-row listers, silk stockings, tennis rackets, and a thousand other commodities to provide what we consider an American standard of living for all of that part of our population who are willing to work.

            <seg id="p756">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE end of its profitable extension, and that there are some evidence of a backward percolation. It is therefore timely that there should be a stock taking of soil resources. According to estimates made by the Soil Conservation Service within the past four years, the land aban - doned largely on account of erosion that has proceeded beyond the point of practical recovery in the United States is in the neighborhood of 50,000,000 acres. This is an area approximately twice that now under cultivation in Nebraska. We of Nebraska would regard it as a matter of considerable Importance to be retired twice. This land is of course not all in one body nor did the condition occur suddenly. For the most part it is the accumulation of years of uncontrolled erosion, accelerated at times by floods such as occurred in the Republican Valley in 1935. These lands have gone permanently out of produc - tion. There is no comfort in the thought that they no longer compete with those lands it seems necessary to retire in order to reduce crop surpluses. There is, however, another phase of soil erosion loss that is perhaps of greater consequence than the loss of the lands that have been permanently ruined. This involves the lands that are not so badly washed, lands that are still being farmed, but from which so much topsoil has been eroded that they are being tilled with greater difficulty, are producing lower yields, and thus are inevitably bringing lowered returns to the owners and operators. The Soil Conservation Service estimates the area of such lands in the country at 100,000,000 acres, which is four times the area of land available for crops in Nebraska. (Census of 1935) I do not know how much Nebraska's quota of this area may be. We do know, however, that Nebraska has not escaped. Water erosion losses depend upon numerous factors, such as soil texture and structure, slope of the land, amount of and. nature of the rainfall, farming system, and tillage method. In western Nebraska the conditions of limited rainfall and wide areas of comparatively level land contribute to a low rate of removal of soil by washing. On the other hand, the compara - tively light soils, often with a high sand content and not very high organic matter, are easily broken down in structure and thus are easily moved by either water or wind. Also tillage practices such as fallowing to store moisture frequently leaves large areas unprotected by surface cover which further aggravates the condition of easy soil movement. On the whole in western Nebraska, wind erosion or soil blowing is a greater menace than water erosion. There are, however, some com - pensations in wind erosion that water erosion does not have. Water moves and carries its soil load down grade only. Soil is removed from the higer areas and slopes and is deposited on the lower lands or into the streams and out to sea. The deposits on the lower lands are fre - quently of limited value or even detrimental. The higher lands are im- </seg>
            <seg id="p757">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION povertehed more rapidly than the lower lands are improved. The soil that goes down the slope never comes back and the net result is always in the direction of soil impoverishment. Wind on the other hand, deposits its load with much less respect to slope or altitude It is common for the western farmer on a windy day to speak of farms changing hands. While much soil, especially the humus and finer particles, is carried away by wind to other areas and is never re - covered other great quantities circulate and redeposit in the area of origin, or to lesser extent in more distant agricultural areas There is perhaps little consolation to the Plains farmer to know that his good top soil in blowing away may add something to some less fertile area. The loss however, is less complete than though a like amount of soil had been removed by water. of f Th H, J ari( T PhaS6S ° f SOU COnservation ' that »&lt;» the preservation of fertility and the control of wind and water erosion, are interrelated parts of a single problem. That moisture is the chief limiting factor in crop production in the non-irrigated section of western Nebraska and the Great Plains as a whole, no one will deny. It is an old story that when above-normal rains occur and the distribution is favorable crop yields are high, barring of course hail, frost, insect pests and crop diseases. When rainfall and distribution are normal, yields are fair When rainfall is much below normal or poorly distributed, crop yie ds run from poor to complete failure. It sometimes happens when moisture is plentiful that quite good results occur irrespective of the tillage methods employed. These conditions have to some extent developed an attitude of indifference to fertility or to farming prac - tices, and to the conclusion that fertility on western dry farmed lands is inexhaustible. Many early farmers concluded that good yields were relatively certain regardless of method if rain occurred and failure in - evitable if fate brought dry weather. The discovery of the possibilities of fallow changed this attitude somewhat in respect to tillage, but fertility is still regarded by many as relatively unimportant. There are several reasons why it has been possible so largely to gnore the fertility problem in dry farming. The first of these is that in most of our valley and table land soils, Initial fertility is high on account of an adequate supply of the mineral elements of fertility and a sufficient if not high organic matter content developed by the decay of eaves and roots under long years of grass cover. The second factor is a relatively slow exhaustion of fertility on account of the limitations imposed upon crop yields by an inadequate moisture supply If fer - tility were continually used as rapidly as it is In the best crop years or as it may be where supplemental water can be supplied, the story would be very different. At North Platte in 1915 the average yield of oats on the dry land rotation fields was 70 bushels per acre. This was more than double the total yield of the previous five years, which contained </seg>
            <seg id="p758">REPORT OK NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE two total failures and three years of low yield. Obviously there was not much fertility removed by the crop during this five year period. After many years of cropping, many farms are apparently producing as high average yields as in their earlier years. This does not neces - sarily mean that the soil still has as great a store of fertility as it did in the beginning. It means only that there is yet a sufficient amount to supply the limited needs of the low yield for which low rainfall is as yet the primary cause. A third factor that contuses the fertility problem on dry land is the paradox that with a limited moisture supply a certain lowering of fertility may actually increase yields. That Is, grain yields may at times be increased. The first effects of decreased or limited fertility are de - creased vegetative growth. Small grains stool less and are reduced in height, corn stalks are more slender, shorter, and produce fewer suckers. Conversely, high fertility stimulates rank vegetative growth. This increases water requirements and water use, and not infrequently moisture stored in the soil is exhausted before grain production is completed. Thus a fine prospect is at times turned into a complete failure. On the less fertile soils the smaller plants use less moisture during the earlier stages of growth and a greater supply remains to fill out the heads and ears. Retarded early growth resulting from planting in colder soil at the bottom of furrows furnishes a part of the explanation for the superiority of listing over surface planting of corn. Limited fertility may under certain conditions produce similar effects. The North Platte dry land crop rotation results furnish numerous examples of this principle. In one case, two adjacent plats were treated for a preliminary period of 10 years. On one, the land was continuous clean fallowed. No crop was seeded and no 'weeds allowed to grow. On the com - panion plat, rye was grown and plowed under each year. At the end of the preliminary period the total nitrogen content of the top foot of soil was 10 per cent higher and the organic matter content 37 per cent higher where the 10 crops of rye had been plowed under than where the land was continuously fallowed. These plats were then used for winter wheat for a period of 13 years. The average per acre grain yields were 17.8 bushels on the land that had been fallowed and 16.7 bushels or 1.1 bushels or 6 per cent less on the more fertile soil where the rye had been plowed under. The straw yields however show very different Tesults. The average yields were 1,570 pounds on the land having the preliminary fallow' period and 2,180 pounds on the more fertile soil where the rye was plowed under. This is a gain of nearly 40 per cent in straw yield. This heavy straw growth practically every year exhausted soil moisture before growth was complete, and the grain was frequently lighter and </seg>
            <seg id="p759">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION more shrivelled than that from the companion plat. With an adequate moisture supply, it is not improbable that the differences in straw yields would have been even greater and, barring the possibilities of lodging, it is not improbable also that the grain yields on the more fertile soil would have been not depressed but increased in proportion to the straw yield. A similar result was secured from the use of barnyard manure. In a 3-year rotation of oats, corn and spring wheat, barnyard manure was applied at the rate of about ten tons per acre each year as the land was prepared for oats. By this system each plat in the rotation was manured every third year. In the 28 years that the rotations were continued, each 3-year rotation completed 9 cycles plus one year. Each unit of ground in the manured rotation received 9 applications of manure. The results are compared with the averages from three other 3-year rotations having the same crops but receiving no manure. At the end of the 28-year period, the manured land contained in the upper 6 inches of soil 13 per cent more total nitrogen and approximately two tons more organic matter per acre than the unmanured land. The average yields for the 28-year period were when reduced to the com - mon denominator of spring wheat, 12 bushels per acre on the manured land, and 14.9 bushels on the unmanured land, a loss of 19 per cent in grain yield from manuring. The straw-stover yields were however 1,866 pounds on the manured land and 1,793 pounds on the unman - ured land, a gain of four per cent as a result of increasing fertility by manuring. The use of green manures has likewise increased straw and stover yields and reduced grain yields somewhat. In these experiments no materials were added, except the manures, and green manures. Fertilizers containing phosphorus and potassium when used under similar conditions in dry-land soils have not been effective in modifying the reaction of crops as here recorded. These illustrations are given not with the idea of depreciating the importance of fertility in dry land soils but rather to show that grain yields alone may be a very imperfect measuring stick to indicate changes that may be taking place when land is kept continually under cultivation. Organic matter plays a highly important role in dry land soils. Its preservation and restoration are problems of major importance. Organic matter cements the soil particles into granules and helps to pre - serve structure. It aids the penetration of moisture and helps' to bring the elements of fertility into forms that can be used by plants. The lowering of organic matter increases the rate of soil erosion by both water and wind, and increases the draft of tillage implements. Although fertile soils may blow badly when dry if left smooth and unprotected, it is very much easier to control ' blowing on soils that have a good </seg>
            <seg id="p760">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE organic matter content than where this is not present. In 1935 the table land area used since 1905 for dry land rotation and tillage experiments at the North Platte Substation had to be abandoned to make way for a power and irrigation reservoir. In order to secure more accurate information on the residual effects of tillage and cropping practices than were supplied by the crop yields, soil samples were taken from all the plats for determination of total nitrogen and organic matter. These results have not been published or completely tabulated. Table 1 shows the organic matter content of native sod and that of the soils after seven different methods of cropping and treatment. Organic matter was not actually determined in all cases. . Total nitrogen was determined for all plats. In those cases in which both organic matter and nitrogen were determined, the ratios were fairly constant and averaged approximately 18.4 to 1. In this table the figures given for organic matter are calculated on the basis of 18.4 times total nitrogen. The cropping systems and treatments are arranged in descending order of organic matter content or in ascending order of organic matter loss with native sod as the base. Percentage losses are also given. The amounts given are for the upper 6 inches of soil. Most tillage operations are performed upon or within this layer. It is the zone of richest concentration of organic matter and the zone of most active chemical and bacteriological processes. It may not however remain the same zone where surfaces are allowed to wear down by cultivation and erosion or where some protecting influences allow the surface to build up. The rapid removal of any considerable portion of this layer as where fields are allowed to blow continuously for a season or more may effect soil productivity more seriously than many years of cropping. The cropped soils shown in the table had been under cultivation for a period of 44 years. Of this 16 years was general farming mostly with corn. The experimental treatments designated, cover 28 years. Native sod adjacent to the cultivated field had 43,500 pounds or 21% tons of organic matter per acre in the 6-inch layer of top soil. Next to native sod are three 3-year rotations receiving barnyard manure with an average of 34,700 pounds of organic matter in the 6-inch layer. The organic matter loss was 8,800 pounds or 20 per cent. Corn was one of the crops grown in each of these rotations. One rota - tion contained two spring small grains, the other two rotations each contained one spring small grain and one drilled sorghum crop. Well rotted barnyard manure at the rate of about 10 tons per acre was applied to one of the three plats of each of the three rotations each year so that every land unit received manure every third year. </seg>
            <seg id="p761">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION In the two 6-year rotations, with the land in sod half time or three years out of each six, bromegrass was used for the sod crop in one and alfalfa in the other. On account of failure of stands of these crops in some years, the land was not actually in sod half the time. Hay was removed whenever produced so that when sod was plowed on these plats nothing of the above ground parts of the plants was turned under except stubble and lower leaves. • The organic matter loss was 4 per cent greater than from the manured plats. Next in order after the sod rotations is the land continuously cropped with spring grains, oats, barley, and spring wheat. The drop in organic matter loss between this and the previous treatment is slight, being only 1 per cent. The favorable showing of continuous cropping with small grains without manure in rate of organic matter loss in comparison with the sod crop and green manure rotations is probably due in part at least to this land having a protective cover for a greater portion of each season than where row crops are used in the rotation. Plowing under peas or rye for green manure every fourth year which of course involves the loss of the land for one-fourth of the time was 7 per cent less effective. As a means of preserving organic matter, than the application of barnyard manure every third year. In the 3-year rotations of corn and two crops of small grains with - out manure the organic matter loss was 10 per cent greater than where barnyard manure was applied every third year. Under this system of cropping the organic matter loss was 30 per cent in land that had been cropped for 44 years. Where fallow was substituted for corn in 3-year rotations, the loss of organic matter was increased to 34 per cent. This is 9 per cent more than in continuous cropping with small grain. A large part of this loss is doubtless due to exposure to washing and blowing during the fallow season. Some of it is probably also due to oxidation of organic matter from direct action of the sun on unprotected surfaces during the summer months. The heaviest organic matter loss was from land continuously crop - ped with corn. This is 12 per cent greater than from the 3-year rota - tions having 2 crops of small grain and 1 of corn, and 17 per cent greater than from continuous cropping with small grain. The loss of 42 per cent in 44 years approximates 1 per cent per year of cropping. Corn has come to be a well recommended crop in the central Plains not only on account of its value for feed but because it fits well into rotations with small grains. It usually exhausts soil moisture less completely than small grains, and furnishes a cheaply prepared seed bed where winter grains are seeded into the standing stalks or where the stalks are disked for spring grains. However, the mellow surface </seg>
            <seg id="p762">UEPORTOF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE maintained by cultivation through the summer months of greatest rainfall exposes the soil, especially on sloping land, not planted on the contour to heavy loss by washing — and where stalk growth is light or removed for fodder or ensilage, the soil is exposed to blowing for a long period during the winter and spring months. Both washing and soil blowing take place at a more rapid rate as the soil becomes older, as the grass root fibers disappear and the organic matter con - tent is lowered. The results presented indicate that the loss of organic matter in dry farmed soils may be proceeding much more rapidly than is indicated by crop yields. The rate of loss may be slowed up by the judicious use of barnyard manure. The farmer who spreads manure on his land, although he may see no immediate results in increased crop yields and may even at times see grain yields depressed, is still not wasting his time. He is at least building for posterity better than is his neighbor who dumps his manure into the canyons or moves the barn to get away from the pile. The man with livestock in his system of farming of course has the advantage of having some manure to dispose of. The tractor farmer with no manure at his disposal must seek other means of organic matter preservation and restoration. As organic matter in the prairie soils had its origin in grass, it is natural that we should turn back to that source. This is a field of admitted difficulties, and one in which the available information is very limited. The first of the difficulties is the scarcity of well adapted kinds that produce seed in sufficient abundance to be cheap in price. Of so - called tame grasses, both crested wheat grass and bromegrass do fairly well further north, with crested wheat grass coming into the ascendency. The most difficult part of establishing crested wheat grass at North Platte is to get it by the seedling stage. The seedlings will stand low temperatures but at times have been injured during the summer. Bromegrass has been somewhat easier to start than crested wheat grass. The latter has not been grown there for a sufficient time to test its persistance. The seed is still high in price. Considerable recent work has been done in the collecting and testing of native grasses. Many of these produce seed sparingly and that produced is low in viability. With the large amount of work now being under - taken with grasses, it is not improbable that grasses will be de - veloped that are as well adapted to this section as is crested wheat grass to the northern Plains. </seg>

The relocated and reorganized dry land experimental project at North Platte contains more grass studies than were previously in - cluded. In one case a series of plats are being seeded to grass this year to be broken up in successive years, for a 9-year period. In another case a series of plats will be seeded in successive years and the entire series with sod ranging in age from one to nine years broken up at one time. In each case after the sod is broken, cropping will be continued until its effects have disappeared as indicated by crop yields and organic matter determinations. A major difficulty in establishing grass under dry farm conditions is that of finding a time when the surface soil remains wet for a sufficient time for the seed to germinate and become established. Most grass seeds are small and cannot be seeded deeply. Many kinds of grasses germinate slowly. Grasses that may endure a great amount of adversity after becoming fully established require favorable condi - tions during the seedling stage. Repeated seedings greatly increase costs especially when seed is high in price. Seeding on dry soil in the hope that rain will follow is hazardous. A firm seed bed is highly </seg>
            <seg id="p764">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE «ssential. A litter mulch of some sort after seeding may be of con - siderable benefit in holding moisture and protecting seedlings against soil blowing. With seeds that can be drilled, seeding in clean stubble may have some merit. Other methods that suggest themselves in ■connection with the use of fallow are: (1) Early fall seeding with a light cover crop of spring grains that will be killed by freezing during the winter and still serve to catch snow and furnish protection for the young grass plants; and (2) seeding the cover crop in the fall and drill - ing grass into this in the spring. With seed high in price it is logical to prepare carefully for seeding. Also with the limited information available on seeding methods, it is logical to proceed on a moderate scale and expand as practical methods are developed and the possi - bilities of local seed production are ascertained. In conclusion I wish to return briefly to the subject of the relation •of tillage to soil erosion control. We have endeavored to point out the accelerated rate of organic matter reduction and hazards of soil blowing on land in fallow and row crops. Are there any practices that may be employed to reduce these hazards? Among the most important are perhaps planting on the contour or with cross slope listing and strip farming. The average western farmer has the firmly established habit of farming by compass points or section lines. He likes to have his crop rows parallel with the fence rows and all of equal length regardless of slope. This practice has the advantage of making acreages easy to calculate. Sometimes it saves time in turning and in checking up on the hired man to see whether he has done a full days work. I wonder whether these factors really deserve the consideration that has been given to them. Most so-called level lands have considerable slope. During heavy dashing rains the movement of water over the surface may be considerable even though the slope Is not very great. Any arrangement of rows that will reduce the slope and hold the water where it falls until it has time to penetrate will increase soil moisture storage. Improved moisture conditions help to control blowing. When furrows are run across the general slope, it is again important to make an upward bend where ever a gulley Is to be crossed. Otherwise drainage will converge into the gulleys and more damage may be done then though the drainage is kept divided by running the rows down the slope. Contour furrowing should be done with care and the use of a level is essential for best results. A new machine is being worked upon by agricultural engineers to hold water where it falls on the fields. This is the furrow dam or basin lister attachment. This machine if used in connection with con - tour listing should remove the necessity of running the furrows on as accurate levels. It has a soil collecting attachment that dumps at intervals leaving the furrows blocked off in sections or basins which stop or check the flow of water down the furrows and off the field. </seg>
            <seg id="p765">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION In western Kansas it has been shown that listing and middle busting is an efficient method of preparing stubble land for reseedlng to wheat. The lister is also used extensively in preparing fallows. With this basin making attachment, the lister should have added efficiency as a tillage implement. The interest in strip farming appears to be on the Increase. In various places in western Nebraska one runs across farms where it is being tried out. I have recently been informed by the superintendent of the Dry Land Field Station at Havre, Montana, that strip farming in a wheat-fallow system has worked a vast improvement in some of the Canadian prairie stations where soil blowing had almost ruined the industry. In that section strips of wheat and fallow about 200 feet in width are alternated. Frequently furrows are maintained on the sides of the fallowed strips to catch sifting soil and prevent its forming drifts along the sides of the stubble strips. Soil blowing from the fallow is not completely stopped, but the greater part of the sifting particles are caught in the furrows and stubble and is not lost from the fields. To sum up we have attempted to show: 1. That organic matter depletion in dry land soils may be pro - ceeding more rapidly than crop yields indicate. 2. That the most rapid rate of loss takes place on fallow and row cropping. 3. That barnyard manure is more of an asset than a liability on any farm. 4. That regrassing possibilities should be given serious consider - ation. 5. That contour listing has merit on sloping land and that strip - farming is worthy of trial. </seg>
            <seg id="p766">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE POTATO PROJECTS IN SMITH-HUGHES HIGH SCHOOL COURSES JOHN ROTH, Hay Springs, Nebr. In our Smith-Hughes Vocational Agriculture work each student selects his project for home practice work. The student usually selects a type of project in which he is most interested and one which fits in with the home farm program. Best results are obtained when the boy selects a kind of project in which he is really interested. The following crops projects have been carried as home practice projects in our Vocational Agriculture program: Corn Production. Potato Production. Wheat Production. Barley Production. Oats Production. Sudan Grass Production. Cane Production. The size of the crop projects are determined by four factors; seed available, capital required for seed and operating costs, machinery available, and by land available. Potato projects range from two, to ten acres in size. To give you an idea of the nature of the potato project, I will outline the jobs which are studied and practiced. Selection of seed. Treating of seed. Selection and the use of proper equipment. Seed bed preparation. Cutting the seed. Planting the crop. Methods and time of cultivation. Diseases of potatoes. Digging the crop. Handling potatoes at digging time. Storage conditions. \ Grading. Causes of losses in storage. Loading of potatoes in car or truck. Marketing the crop. Keeping records in project book. The student studies each of these jobs. in the class room and in actual practice as far as possible before he starts his projects, and writes plans for each job in his project book. Then in actually carry- </seg>
            <seg id="p767">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION ing on the practice jobs be gets more experience and information about the different problems. You can readily see the possibilities that a potato project offers from an educational standpoint. The student who is really interested can certainly do plenty, both in study and in actual practice of the different jobs. The success of his potato project depends largely on his study of the different jobs or problems involved and on the interest he has in his enterprize. In refering to my project records I have the following in regard to number of different crop projects the past three years. Corn Production 20 Potato Production 20 Wheat Production 5 Sudan Grass Production 3 Barley Production 2 Oats Production 2 Cane Production 1 From this you may place the importance that the potato project lias in our home practice program. Of these twenty potato projects fourteen have shown a profit, while six have shown a loss. Yield per acre and price received as you all know are important items in effecting a profit or loss. In a good many cases, losses can be prevented or profits increased by the proper handling of the job at hand. If the boy did every job in his potato project poorly, he of course could not expect much benefit either in profits or in knowledge. On the other hand if he followed the best practice in each job and studied each situation carefully he should have a larger profit and gain more educationally. In my estimation the Potato Improvement Association can lend assistance to the Smith-Hughes project program by: First: Helping to provide good quality seed for students interested in potato production. Second: Provide this seed at a minimum cost. Third: Encourage the boy to follow the best practices and let him know you are interested in helping him get started in the potato business. </seg>
            <seg id="p768">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND THE POSSIBILITIES OF 4-H POTATO CLUB WORK HASKELL HANKINS, Nebraska Certified Potato Growers Cooperative This past year, the Potato Improvement Association, and the- Extension Service cooperated, and gave some assistance to the 4-H potato clubs. I'm sure the club members and the County Agents appreciated this help, and I feel that this help should be continued. i . The potato club offers its member technical and practical training in all the phases of potato growing somewhat as follows: (1) They are given technical training in their special line of work, and they are given a chance to put it into practice. i (2) They are given leadership training. They learn to "stand on their own feet", and how to stand up for something that they believe - is right, and should be done. That is one of the things that is wrong with our agricultural industry at the present time. There are too few farmers that know the value of organization and leadership. They will let someone, or some other group, cram something down their throats that they do not need, nor have any use for. The only way we are to ever overcome this situation, is to train our farm youth. (3) The club members are taught how to keep records, and the value of the same. A farmer will not have more money in the bank at the end of the year by keeping a record of what he sells, and how much it cost him to grow that particular crop, but it will give him valuable information for the coming year. It will show him what is making money, and where he is losing, or, we might say for the past few years, which crop has been losing the most. (4) The club work affords competition for the members. Each one is given a chance to exhibit his product with the other members. If they win, they know why they win, and if they do not win, they learn why they did not, and they learn many things by so doing. The contest between the members are unlike athletic teams. They are conducted not for the purpose of just winning, but to learn some - thing that will tend to make better farmers, and better homemakers. It is something that they will carry through life. A member who may never have won a first place in a contest may learn as much as if he had won every time that he participated in a contest. They learn- to - lose cheerfully, and win without boasting. We may explain the club work better by giving a brief review of the work that was done in the 4-H potato clubs last year. </seg>
            <seg id="p769">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION Organization meetings were held in four counties of western Ne - braska. Several clubs were organized. The first thing that was taken up was how to conduct a formal meeting properly. The clubs met once a month and discussed the lessons that were prepared by a specialist on that subject. They had demonstrations on the various phases of the work, such as seed selection, seed treatment, and seed cutting. These demonstrations were put on by the club members with the assist - ance of the club leader, and the country agricultural agent. When the potato plants were in condition favorable to detect diseases, there were tours of the club members' fields. All of the club members were there, and many of their parents. The County Agent, and a specialist, showed them various diseased plants, and explained their importance. The club members were given an •opportunity to test their ability to pick out the diseased plants. The various phases of cultivation were discussed. Each member could observe the other members' fields, and learn something that he should have done, or could have done, to produce a better crop. We held county contests to give the members of the clubs an oppor - tunity to compete with each other in the practical phases of potato growing. The contests were divided into four parts: (1) Each member had to present a record of his crop, stating all of his operations, and the cost of each, and cash returns of the crop. ( 2 ) The exhibiting &lt;3t a show sample. (3) Each contestant had to judge two varieties for quality and appearance. (4) They sorted a sack of potatoes, which was judged on the quality of the pack. If they left defective potatoes in the pack, it was marked against them. If they threw pota - toes out of the pack that should have been left in, that also was marked against them. In all the events, most of the contestants were able to score from 75% to 95% perfect. The value of contests similar to the one we held, teaches the future farmers the value of a good product, and how to produce it. The five best show samples in the state contest were sent to Chicago, to compete with the exhibits of other club members from other states. Nebraska won a 3rd, 5th and 8th in the national contest. We felt proud of this, because this was the first time Nebraska was represented there. We were proud that our potato exhibits were recognized for their quality, but we are more proud of the boys and girls that grew these potatoes, and the worthwhile knowledge they received by doing this. The main object is to raise better men and better women, and by -so doing, we will have more prosperous agricultural conditions. The toys and girls have in this club work, the opportunity to make many -social contacts. It teaches them that they do not have to move to the </seg>

MORROW, Sales Manager, Nebraska Certified Potato Growers Cooperative The Hastings Potato Growers Exchange was started in 19 22 and has completed fifteen years of successful operation. This association was the result of initiative on the part of actual potato growers and was in no way a promotion scheme. Very often, co-operatives are started purely as a promotion proposition and nearly as often, those co-operatives fail after one or two years of attempted operation. A demand must exist for the services which a co-operative hopes to extend, and that demand was existing in the Hastings, Florida section due to the nature of the crop and the prevailing method of financing it. Production of potatoes in Florida is costly. Seed must be shipped in. Heavy applications of commercial fertilizer are used, the crop production is hazardous, spraying must be followed and containers must be purchased. The barrel is the standard container in that territory and it is expensive. Financing the potato crop and distribution of supplies was handled by potato dealers who operated on a wide margin because of the risk involved. Growers felt that this system penalized the efficient to adequately cover the risk assumed on the inefficient, and that a co-operative organized to administer these services and sell the crop would eliminate the wide margin maintained to protect the middle man. The Association finances its members, sells them supplies and sells their potatoes. It does not solicit memberships nor conduct member - ship campaigns. The action is entirely voluntary on the part of the grower. The membership contract requires growers to sell through the Association but does not require them to buy supplies from it. All members are charged for all losses on their shipments individually. The membership fee is $15.00, the contract runs for ten years and is re - newable without additional payment. Provision is made in the con - tract for concellation in any one year. The Association maintains a field force and in recent years has built and operated several packing plants which are operated on a self maintaining basis and which growers patronize at their option. </seg>
            <seg id="p771">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION Each days potatoes are pooled according to grade and according to field or warehouse packing. Each morning, a committee consisting of representatives from the Association and the larger dealers in that territory meet and set the prices at which the various grades of potatoes will be quoted for that day. An effort is made to fix prices that will move all potatoes loaded each day. If the price is too high, potatoes do not sell, and a revision downward must be made. If demand is heavier than anticipated, or loadings lighter, prices can be advanced. In order to encourage early buying, the Association guarantees its price for that day against decline but does not guarantee against advances. If prices drop after a sale is made, the buyer is given the benefit of the drop. The Association does not differ from other dealers in its sales prac - tices. An effort is made to sell everything of standard quality f.o.b. shipping point, before shipment is made. Failing to do this, the pota - toes are rolled for diversion and an attempt made to sell while in transit or basis price upon arrival at destination. As a last resort the potatoes are consigned to one of the numerous connections of the Association. All off-grade and number two potatoes are consigned and sold on their merit. Pools are usually closed about three weeks after shipment and growers not in debt to the Association can draw all their money except 10£ per barrel which is held until the end of the season to pay any unexpected losses; A definite program, somewhat complicated but quite certain in re - sult, is followed for the accumulation of reserves. A reserve charge, averaging 8 % is collected from each grower on supplies sold to him, such as seed, fertilizers, and containers. A reserve averaging 6%, in addition to the interest charged, is collected from growers on cash advanced to them and a reserve of at per barrel is made against pota - toes sold for "them. These reserves are accumulated for definite pur - poses such as financing, establishing credit with the outside trade and enabling the Association to pay cash for supplies. A sinking fund, to pay losses in growers accounts is provided from interest earned and profit in selling. Provision is made to prorate reserve accumulations to members after their equity in the reserve reaches a certain maximum. The Association shows a total members' equity of over four hundred thousand dollars and a membership of a little over one hundred. This appears to be a very large surplus, one which would finance the entire crop and permit a 100% loss and might prove a hardship to the average grower. Apparently it is justified or it could not exist in a co-operative association. It may be that a percentage of this reserve or surplus is represented by growers accounts and notes that should not be written off but at the same time can not be readily liquidated. </seg>
            <seg id="p772">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE REVIEW OP THE 1935 CROP SEASON ( ■ ' ; ... By the Secretary During the past year those interested in potatoes have observed or participated in many events of a greatly varied nature. At the time of our last annual meeting — March 1935 — a preliminary series of meet - ings had just been held in Denver and elsewhere by AAA officials for the purpose of i familiarizing potato growers concerning the pro - posed potato stabilization bill —^nown commonly as the Warren Act. Discussion of this proposed act was a subject of much discussion at that time. i ■■ ■ ~ ."■. The meeting on the first day of our annual meeting in March 1935 was very poorly attended because of another very severe dust storm. It being one of a number of storms of that kind which had been occur - ring during the winter even the most courageous potato growers were showing evidence of some pessimism concerning the 1935 crop pro - duction possibilities. Dust storms continued and the drought was unabated till about the middle of April. During April, May and June there was 8 to 10 inches of rainfall throughout all western Nebraska. The soil was filled with moisture to a depth of about 5 feet and the 1935 crop went into the ground under very favorable conditions. During this very favorable late spring weather Congress also passed the Warren Bill and prospects for potato growers were rather bright. However, the passage of this bill certainly "put the potato into politics." Eastern, — and some western newspapers were rabid In their denunciation. Even promises of taming down the provisions of the bill did not appease the opposition. Potato farmers were painted as being worse than cartoonists had ever pictured the trusts in the days of the first Roosevelt. The June rains were the last for many weeks, but they were suf - ficient to produce a good crop. The summer was hot and dry and there was practically no rain of consequence throughout the grow - ing season. In the irrigation districts only 12 inches of irrigation water was available and many growers were fearful concerning crop prospects. In early summer — early plantings were severely damaged by Colorado beetles. Later in the summer psyllids were found in abund - ance in many potato fields, especially in Kimball, Banner, and Scotts Bluff counties. Potato growers started to spray with lime-sulphur and high pressure spray machines were seen for the first time in various parts of the North Platte Valley. The early crop was seriously damaged by psyllids — the tubers being very rough. Rather un- </seg>
            <seg id="p773">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION expectedly this pest did very serious damage to some late planted dry land fields. Control experiments were conducted by the state experi - ment station in the North Platte Valley. At the beginning of the potato harvesting season potato folks and the many friends of the Koehnke family were shocked and grieved to learn of the sudden death as a result of an accident, of our much esteemed former president George Koehnke. At harvest time most growers were pleased with the crop har - vested. On dry land good yields were produced even though there was practically no rain during the crop season. The quality of the crop was excellent with little scab and fusarium. In the irrigated dis - tricts results were very satisfactory and the quality was definitely the best of any crop produced for many years. Because of the lack of late irrigation the tubers matured better than usually and the crop was put into the bin with less than the customary amount of mechanical injury. Prices were very low and this good crop brought cheer only to the most stalwart. During the summer and fall an effort was made to interest potato growers in a movement to start a program for marketing table potatoes similar to that in use by the certified seed potato growers. There was much thought and talk but it seemed impossible to galvanize these into action. During the late fall the Nebraska Certified Potato Growers Cooperative took the initiative and marketed a superior quality of potatoes under a distinct brand. The results secured by it, as re - ported in this program, indicate that there is a very good market for Triumph potatoes of superior quality. Just after potato harvesting the potato growers interest in the political phase of the business was again aroused. A series of meet - ings were held by the AAA to organize growers of Colorado, Nebraska, Wyoming, and Idaho under a Marketing Agreement for the 1935 crop and also to advise them of the plans for operating the Warren Bill after December. Animated sessions attended by Nebraskans were held at Denver and at Scottsbluff. The plan for a marketing agreement was endorsed, but many were dubious concerning the workability of the scheme over the western area where the conditions and interests are so very varied and regions are so widely separated. The idea was never tested, because while the hearings were being held rumors came in concerning heavy crop losses in the fields in North Dakota, Idaho, and elsewhere. Shortly thereafter the price rose rapidly and although it fluctuated during the winter it was reasonably satisfactory. The crop shipped by rail to date (March 18, 1936) has been 8959 cars, one of the largest if not the largest crop ever shipped in western Nebraska. This Increase is largely due to the expansion of the in- </seg>
            <seg id="p774">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE dustry in the North Platte Valley. Incidentally, the very severe winter and deep snow in eastern Nebraska, and throughout the corn - belt states, caused a very greater percentage of the crop to be ship - ped by rail and relatively much less by truck than in other recent years. These extensive shipments probably mean that there may be a shortage of seed potatoes at planting time in June. During the late fall the northeastern portion of the pan-handle potato district got considerable nation-wide publicity through the publication of the much discussed biography "Old Jules" by Mari Sandoz. As people of that district lived through some previous dry years, when the potato crop did not amount to much, and good years have followed, all have reason to hope that we have seen the worst of a cycle of dry years. Had "Old Jules" taken up potato growing instead of or in addition to fruit growing he might have given that other very well known Swiss pioneer from Kimball county some real competition as the Patriarch of the Potato Association. We would then have been assured of many even more animated sessions in past years. When potato farmers were busy in January, shipping the seed po - tatoes to the south the U. S. Supreme Court decided that certain phases of the AAA were not constitutional. Shortly thereafter it was de - cided to abandon the enforcement of the Warren Potato Bill and con - fusion was again coming over the horizon. Present plans now involve the establishment of some form of marketing agreement under exist - ing laws and to bring some benefit to potato growers under the Soil Conservation program. With the arrival of another March and with little rain since June and a limited amount of irrigation water in prospect, potato farmers may again have opportunity to show how much they have learned about producing crops under adverse conditions. Regardless of what this season will be — it may be said of the 1935 season that it wasn't as bad as it was thought it would be and in fact for most growers it wasn't a bad season at all — but a relatively good one. </seg>

ANNUAL DIRKCTORS MEETING March 10, 103G (8:00 A. M.) Directors present: W. T. Young, Jr., President; J. Pedrett, (Vice Pres.); J. M. Tollman, Anton Stenberg, H. O. Werner, (Sec.-Treas.) The Secretary-Treasurer reported that the insurance and taxes are consuming most of the income, beyond cost of actual operation, on the Ford car bought some years ago for the use of the field man. of the University doing potato work in western Nebraska. As a result the income to date has fallen $191.40 short of paying for the car. After considering the state of the Association treasury and the fact that this car is used in work done for the potato growers — on motion by Tollman and Stenberg, it was voted that the directors authorize the conversion of the title of this car to the University if or the use of the Department of Horticulture. After a discussion of ways and means of being of service to the potato industry by encouraging and instructing the younger people, the Secretary was instructed to draw up and submit to the Directors a plan whereby Association funds could be devoted to financing the purchase of approved seed potatoes by 4-H Club members and mem - bers of Smith-Hughes high school classes with potato projects. On motion by Stenberg and Pedrett — the Secretary was authorized to expend not to exceed $150 for the purpose of conducting a seed potato source demonstration plat in the North Platte Valley in 1936. The following motion by Pedrett seconded by Stenberg and passed — concluded the Directors meeting: — That in view of a number of perplexing production problems the Nebraska Agricultural Extension Service be requested to provide specialist service to the potato industry of the state.

            <seg id="p778">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Special note. Immediately after this series of meetings the Secre - tary consulted and wrote to a number of people concerning the pro - posed program of financing 4-H Club members, etc. From various sources it soon became evident that this was not as good an idea as it had at first seemed to be — principally because it would put the asso - ciation into the banking business for which it is not intended, secondly because the necessary funds could be secured by individual arrange - ments locally and finally because another method seemed preferable. Consequently out of the ideas presented the Secretary drew up the following plan and submitted it to the directors and to County Agents in all extensive potato producing counties. 4-H POTATO CI.UB PROGRAM OF THE NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION FOR 1930 I. In November have 3 potato club contests as follows: (a) Cheyenne, Banner, Kimball counties. (b) Scotts Bluff, Morrill, Southern Sioux, Garden counties. (c) Box Butte, Dawes, Sheridan, Northern Sioux counties. In order to attend such contest each club member must have handed in his report at least two weeks before date of same, to the County Agent. At such contest there wi,ll be two competitions: 1. In judging ideal type samples. 2. In sorting 100 lbs. for U. S. #1 grade. Scores shall be computed from a card to be worked out later to in - clude credit for: a. Production history, giving report on methods, yield, and quality. b. Judging in contest. A banquet will be served to all club members who are admitted to contests and to their club leaders by the Nebraska Potato Improve - ment Association. Some outstanding authorities on potatoes will be in attendance at these banquets. II. Awards for meritorious work in 4-H Potato Clubs. A. The highest ranking individual will be awarded a trip to Club "Week at Lincoln in May. B. On the basis of a scoring system to be worked out later 100 sacks (100 cwt. each) of a superior lot of Foundation Seed Stock will be distributed to club members who have scored above a designated minimum. These awards are to be of three classes : </seg>
            <seg id="p779">NEBRASKA TOTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION 1. The highest group, 5 cwt. each. 2. The second highest group, 2 cwt. each. 3. The third highest group, 1 cwt. each. In any case — the members shall have the privilege of receiving these potatoes or of receiving a cash award of similar value providing that the cash may only be used to apply on expenses for a trip to Club week at Lincoln. No member shall receive a trip plus seed potatoes. This plan was enthusiastically endorsed by all county agricultural agents concerned and was approved by a majority of the board of di - rectors. It was therefore declared in force and due publicity was given to the program by the Agricultural Extension Service. ■ ■ ■ ■■**■. After resolutions adopted at these meetings were presented to Director W. H. Brokaw and several conferences were held, arrange - ments were made for the Agricultural Extension Service to employ Haskell Hankins from May 1 to June 30 to organize the 4-H Potato Club work and to Institute a potato extension service program. He is to continue in this capacity beyond July 1 if funds of the Dept. of Agriculture permit. </seg>

The show was held in the new Auditorium at Columbus, Nebraska, and was probably as fine an exhibition as the State Show has had for many years. The entries were by far the best that had been shown for at least five years and the quality unusually good. The attendance made up from surrounding towns and country was one that will be remembered by exhibitors for quite some time. The show room was neatly decorated, there was ample room for single decks, and a large number of commercial firms were rep - resented at the show. One of the outstanding representations was that of the Robbins Incubator Mammoth Incubator which was exhibited on the stage and drew a great deal of comment, for a great number of people had not seen such an immense incubator in operation before. Judging was done by Judge Smiley, and uniform satisfaction was very evident, for there were no complaints of any kind and the job was accepted as being done as it should have been. The Hatchery Class was one of the finest that had been exhibited for many years, and drew comments from everyone attending. The Grand Champion was won by the Benson Master Hatchery of Omaha. In the regular classes, the Grand Champion of the Show was a White Rock Pullet owned by A. H. Cholcher of Elwood, Nebraska, and was a specimen that one rarely sees, and which I believe was the best Cham - pion bird that has been shown for many, many years. The Champion pen was a young Buff Orpington pen owned by John Skinner of Herman, Nebraska. The Champion male bird was a Buff Orpington Cock Bird owned by R. E. Laing of Blair, Nebraska. And of course, the Champion Female Bird was the Grand Champion White Rock Pullet owned by A. H. Cholcher of Elwood, Nebraska, as mentioned above. The Nebraska Poultry Association owes a large vote of thanks to the Columbus Chamber of Commerce and its members. They were unusually courteous in showing the exhibitors, and the many people who attended the show, the best time possible. On Friday evening, the Annual Banquet of the Nebraska State Poultry Association was held at which time the following program took place: Toastmaster — Frank Shonka, Jr. Music during dinner by Miss Marjorie Byllesby, piano, and Mrs. Hedwig Jaeggi Fontein, violin. </seg>
