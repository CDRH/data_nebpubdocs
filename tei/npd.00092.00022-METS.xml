         <seg id="p003">Further Studies of Selected Types of Domestic Gas Stoves I . ARNOLD E. BARAGAR : This bulletin is a supplement to Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Research Bulletin 86. Tests were conducted in the same manner as were those described in Bulletin 86; hence,,no reference has been made to experimental (methods unless a test has not been previously reported. This paper is primarily concerned with (1) a discussion of cooking tops producing excessive carbon-monoxide gas, (2) more data relative to cook - ing-top burner efficiencies, (3) a further discussion of automatic lighters, and (4) a detailtd study of ovens. COOKING TOPS AND OVENS STUDIED The cooking'tops for this study are shown in Figures Ito 6. Five of them were of, the enclosed type with either removable or fixed burner bowls.) All of the tops followed the present trend towards small round burners. A notiieable change on these stoves was the tendency to bring the burners closer to the bottom of the pan, as one means of increasing the efficiency. . ! ' Stove N had'a burner with an adjustable head so that the distance be - tween jthe pan and burner could be varied to compensate for the difference in flame length between natural and manufactured gas. : Cooking tops'K, L, and P were equipped with simmer burners. On tops X and P both the simmer burner and regular burner were lighted when the gas was on full. On stove L the simmer burner was not a part of the] regular burner and simmer burners were furnished on the front burners only.. \ ; . - The ovens were fully insulated; the doors, side walls, back, and top had insulation which varied in thickness from % inch to 2 inches. Usually the back wall was the least insulated. The type of insulation varied from solid-block mineral wool to loosely packed mineral wool and blanket glass wool. All of the ovens were equipped with automatic heat controls. The doors were\well fitted; that is. no large cracks were noticeable but they could not be considered as being tightly fitted. Before any tests were made, the capacity of each cooking top and oven burner, was computed from the total port area of the burner. Every gas burner is designed to burn a certain quantity of gas expressed in B.t.u. per hour. For domestic burners operating on either natural or manu - factured gas theWepted capacity is 20,000 B.t.u. per square inch of port area.. This knowledge was especially helpful in considering the oven burner, because a.burner made for a larger capacity than was needed to heat the oven could not maintain a low oven temperature. In other words, the burner supplied too much heat when operated on the lowest flame possiblle. This knowledge of burner capacity also proved helpful in. con* sidering cooking tops which produced excessive ca.r.bort monoxide, </seg>

For a burner to be | : considered as producing no carbon monoxide, the American Gas Associa - | tiori Testing Laboratory requires that the percentage of CO in the 5 combustion products shall not be greater than 0.08, on an air-free basis, j Applying this requirement to these cooking tops it is evident that stove I L was the only one that was satisfactory for all the burner inputs tested. ¦| , - In attempting to determine the cause of the excessive carbon monoxide, i stove X should be considered first because its surface burners were tested | under so many varying conditions that the results obtained helped in the I analysis of stoves M,.N, and O. The fact that stove X was prpduc^g f excessive CO became evident during efficiency tests with a gas rate of 11 j cubic feet per hour at normal pressure. Analyses of the combustion products &lt; showed them to be heavily laden with CO. In Table lit is evident that f the burner had a designed capacity for at least 10,900 B.t.u. per hour ; and since most burners will consume satisfactorily a quantity of gas greater ,' than the designed capacity, another cause than an overloading of the 1 burner was sought. It appeared that there was a deficiency of air to complete ; the combustion so when some of the samples were collected, the collecting ij hood was raised from the stove. In other tests the fire-bowl was removed. 1 Samples were also taken for various rates of burning the gas.; 1 Stove Pwas not tested completely since it was a' new model of a stove previously tested and our primary interest was in its oven. ¦. . ¦'.: ... </seg>

         <seg id="p009">: Further Studies of Gas Stoves It will be observed that for a gas rate of 6 cubic feet; per hour at normal pressure, excessive CO was produced on stove O. The same type of smothering was evident as for stove K. As an experiment, the grates were built up by welding on to each prong a strip of metal 3/16 inch high. For the built-up grate the analysis of combustion products was satisfactory for gas rates of 6 and 7 cubic feet per hour but unsatisfactory for higher gas rates. While a gas rate of 8 cubic feet per hour adjusted at normal pressure and operated at 1.25 normal pressure was unsatisfactory, it would have been satisfactory at normal pressure as indicated by the results for a gas rate of 7 cubic feet per hour at 1.25 normal pressure. 2 For stoves . M and N the appearance of the flames at 9 and 10 cubic feet per hour showed that this gas rate was unsatisfactory. For these two stoves the excessive CO was due to the inability of the burners to handle properly higher gas rates than 8 cubic feet per hour. Neither burner was designed s to take care of gas inputs for natural gas higher than those shown in s. Table I. ( The percentages of excess air shown in Table 2 were determined from i the percentages of oxygen in the samples of combustion products. $ The combustion, products from: ovens X, L, M, N, and O were i analyzed for CO and the amount of CO air-free was found to be less • than 0.08 per cent. i COOKING TOP TESTS ? Cooking-top burner efficiency.—No efficiencies were determined for ; gas inputs that would produce CO. This is in contrast to the procedure used in the previous study where the standard gas rate was 9,000 B.t.u. per • hour.: The efficiencies for all cooking tops are listed in Table 3. This table : is a comparison of the efficiencies for the various types of burners and , adds to the data already published.: ¦ • The effect upon efficiency of burners being off-center with respect to ; the burner bowl and grate was studied on stove O. When received, all of the burners on stoves M, N, and O were off-center. The burners on M i were left unchanged, those on N were rebuilt in the stove so that they be - ; came centered, and on stove O the two burners on the'left were adjusted &gt;¦ so that they, became centered while the two burners on the right were | made more off-center. Briefly, the results showed that the efficiency of off - | center burners was about 1 per cent lower than for centered burners for j. all pans except 7 and 8,. where the decrease amounted to not more than 4 per cent. It seems that as far as efficiency is concerned, the centering of ; the burner is not of vital importance. From the construction pomt 1 of '. '¦ view it does indicate poor assembling of parts. -.! ; • The effect of increasing the distance between the burner and the top of the grate is shown by the decrease in efficiency of cooking top N for a gas input of 6,000 B.t.u. per hour. It is especially noticeable for the smaller pans. ..: .¦' ";¦ ':.¦:- '" . ¦ \; . ¦;.-. ' .

Automatic lighters.—The requirement that a satisfactory automatic lighter on a domestic gas stove must meet is that the burner flame must ignite within four seconds after the gas is turned on or re-ignite within lour seconds after the flame is blown out during twenty-five successive trials when the operating pressure has been reduced to half normal pressure. In terms of the accepted lighter tests, stove N was the only one that had a satisfactory lighter. The lighter on this stove functioned correctly at half-normal pressure. The burners on stove X would ignite at normal pressure but would not always relight. At half-normal pressure they did not function correctly. Three of the burners on stove L were satisfactory at normal pressure, but would not light at half-normal pressure. The fourth burner did not light in five successive trials of five seconds each at normal, half-normal, and one-and-one-quarter-normal pressure. The rear burners on stove M were satisfactory at normal pressure but unsatisfactory at half-normal pressure. The front burners would not ignite at all. The results for stove O were similar to the others. None of these lighters, except N, could be considered as satisfactory. Jt was iound for two of the stoves that the lighter was improved by increasing the size of the lighter port in the burner. This allowed more gas to enter the lighter tube and apparently the velocity of the issuing gas was increased enough to carry the gas to the pilot flame. However, it was found that what worked in one case might not work in another. In all fairness it should be pointed out that these tests were conducted on only one stove out of the many manufactured by a company and whereas these lighters were unsatisfactory it cannot be concluded that all of the stoves </seg>
         <seg id="p011">Further Studies of Gas Stoves equipped with the same type of lighter would have faulty automatic lighters. However, since the stoves were chosen from open stock, they were considered as representing the other stoves of the same model. Since the automatic lighter was considered only as a convenience feature and not as a necessity, the problem was not investigated further because of the desire to spend most of the time on the study of ovens. OVEN TESTS Check on thermostat calibration.— With a dial setting of 400 as the point at which the dial reading should agree with the average oven temperature, ovens X, M, and O were considered as satisfactory since the • temperatures were 400.6°, 401.7°, and 398.4° F. respectively.

In obtaining data for the cooling curves, it must be remembered that the ovens are not in steady-state conditions; hence the cooling curves can - not be compared directly with the heat-loss curves. However, it is interest - ing to note that as far as general grouping is concerned the relationships in the two sets of curves are similar.

From these data the average tempera - tures for the top, sidewalk, back, oven door, and broiler door were determined. These temperatures are listed in Table 6. A more detailed study was made of oven M. This oven was chosen hecausc it had more external surface exposed and it was also easy to re - move the inner linings so that the insulation could be taken out. It was desired to determine what effect burner design, insulation, and door cracks had upon the performance of the oven and finally to find out how much heat was actually lost from the vent. Heat loss and calibration tests were hrst performed. The thermostat check has been given in Table 4. After the calibration with burner as received from the manufacturer, 36 ports were closed and it will be noticed from Table 6 that the performance was improved inasmuch as a lower oven temperature could be maintained. With this special burner, and the thermostat dial at 250, the loaded oven test was performed. It was found that the temperature was much lower with a heavy load of sand in the oven. The relation between temperature and time when the oven was loaded is shown in Figure 12.

Room temperature was kept as nearly constant at 80° F. as possible and since the total heat loss from the oven was calculated in terms of room temperature as the reference base, the exhaust temperature from the calorimeter had to be at room temperature also. Before the calorimeter was used for the vent-loss determination, it was necessary to ascertain whether the performance of the oven burner was affected by the addition of the calorimeter to the flue outlet either as stack action or as a retarding factor on the exhaust gases. To check the effect of the calorimeter, samples of the combustion products were taken with the calorimeter connected and disconnected from the oven at time intervals as close together as possible between samples. This flue gas was analyzed for COj and 0... and the percentages of CO 2 were calculated on an air-free basis and compared for connected and disconnected calorim - eter conditions. Volume differences of 0.02 cc. could be measured with the burette used in the Orsat apparatus. For all analyses, nitrogen was put in the manifold at the beginning of each test so that there would be no residual gas from previous tests. The results are given in Table 7.

         <seg id="p021">: . , Further Studies of Gas Stoves DISCUSSION OF RESULTS Combustion products. —The data for stove X indicate that some rela - tion exists between the burner bowl and grate, as used on the stove, and the production of excessive carbon monoxide. While the percentage of CO was greater for high gas rates than for low, the gas input was not de - creased enough to make the burner assembly consistently satisfactory. For gas inputs less than 6.000 B.t.u. per hour the rate of heating would be too slow. It is the author's:opinion that the grate prongs were too nearly on the same level with the stove top, and that with pans having a diameter similar to that of the grate the products of combustion could hot escape and consequently there was a smothering of the flame. With the grate and burner bowl as built-in the cooking top, no change could be found that would give results that would make cooking top X satisfactory. •' For cooking tops M and N gas rates of 9,000 B.t.u. per hour or greater produced excessive CO. From the appearance of the flame it was evident that satisfactory primary air adjustments could not be made lor gas rates of 9,000 B.t.u. per hour or greater. At these gas rates the flames were either irregular and wavering or else, they blew from the ports. The remodeling of the grate on cooking top O has already been mentioned. The addition of 3/16-inch in height to the grate prongs was sufficient to make this burner assembly satisfactory for gas rates of 7,000 B.t.u. per hour or less (adjusted at normal pressure) when operated at 1.25 normal pressure. At higher gas rates the flames blew from the ports. Thermal efficiency of cooking top.— These cooking tops show an in - creased efficiency over the cooking tops previously tested. The highest efficiency was obtained with top P where the burner was very close to the bottom of the pan. Next in order was cooking top M. All of these tests show the advantage of having light-weight but sturdy enclosed tops fitted with burner bowls and light-weight grates. The same conclusions regarding cooking tops as published in Research Bulletin 86 apply to these tops. Automatic lighters.— The automatic-lighter tests showed that this part of the stove still needs improvement. Many times the lighters failed to work properly because the gas would ignite at the end of the lighter tube at the pilot, but the flame would not travel back through the tube to the burner. For the burner on stove L which would not light at 1.25 normal pressure (that is, absolute failure in automatic ignition) the trouble was traced to the lighter port in the burner. The position and angle at which the hole was drilled apparently directed the issuing gas in such a manner that free flow down the lighter tube was checked. .^ v For all of the lighters that failed to function properly, no sure method was found that would insure successful lighting of the burner for at least 25 consecutive trials. V. ; Ovens. —The results in Table 4 show the dependence of low oven temperatures upon low-capacity burners and insulation. It is evident from the data in Table 1 that the burner in oven M had more ports than necessary for the size of oven it was to heat. Consequently when the by- </seg>
         <seg id="p022">Acrici ltiral Experiment Station Research Bulletin 111 pass valve was regulated to give the minimum flame possible without extinguishing the flames there was still so much heat being delivered to the- oven that the temperature would not go lower than 301 °F. By plugging 3ft ports and readjusting the by-pass valve to again produce the smallest flame possible, a temperature of 231° F. was attained. Note also how many excess ports were used on the burner in oven O by referring to both Table I and Table 4. The data lor M" show how the oven-air temperature was further de - creased by the removal of all insulation. It is apparent that the decrease was caused by the increased heat loss from the outer surfaces. Referring to Figure 11, suppose that the heat loss of oven M was decreased to a value lower than that of X by better insulation of the oven. It would then be found that the special burner of M" would no longer be satisfactory be - cause the minimum flame would now supply too much heat. It would again be necessary to plug more ports to decrease the heat input. Thus as the oven insulation is improved the burner must be redesigned. That is precisely what was done for oven P. The burner in this oven is an example ol a design which meets the requirements of rapid preheating as shown in Figure 7 and also of maintaining low temperatures as shown .n Table 4. There is still a third factor that will lower the internal temperature of the oven, namely the effect of putting a cold substance in the oven. The thermostat which controls the oven temperature may be located in a place where it is only slightly alTected by the cold load. Thus, while around the thermostat the temperature is such that the controls regulate the gas to give the temperature indicated on the dial, the actual temperatures around the load may be much lower. This is shown in Figure 12 where the oven temperature was 215°-21H° F. with the dial set at 250. When the load was removed, the temperature for the empty oven finally rose to 245.6° F., where it remained. Figures 10 and 11 show that ovens X and L had better heat-retaining i)ualities than the other ovens. The data given by the graph in Figure 11 are the most important because the actual heat loss in B.t.u. per hour tor any oven-air temperature may be obtained from the curves. In con - nection with the graphs in Figure II it is of interest to note the various average surface temperatures given in Table 6. The top temperatures on oven L are not comparable with similar temperatures on the other ovens because the cooking-top burners were immediately above the oven and top temperatures were measured on the cover over the top burners. Also the broiler on stove L was separate from the oven burner; that is, it was a separate compartment opposite the cooking top. Surface temperatures on the sides and back were separated according to the area surrounding the oven and that surrounding the broiler. While these surface temperatures indicate the relative heat loss from the different parts of the oven, they do not give a complete picture of the entire heat-loss areas. This is evident from a comparison with Figure 11. For instance oven X had a lower heat loss than oven L, but the surface temperatures of oven L were lower </seg>
         <seg id="p023">Further Studies of Gas Stoves than those of oven X, indicating that oven L was losing a great amount ot heat at some place that was not measured. Likewise oven O can be com - pared with ovens M and N. Oven L was designated as a fresh-air oven; that is, openings were provided at the rear and bottom of the oven so that fresh air could enter. However, upon plugging these openings with cork it was found that the heat loss was decreased only by approximately 15U B.t.u. per hour. Thus these openings do not materially affect the near-retaining qualities of the oven. The average temperatures for the three planes in the oven as given in lable 5 show that the heat distribution was quite uniform. However comparing individual temperatures with these average temperatures showed the following. For ovens X and L the center of the lower and middle planes was hotter than at the corners. For ovens M and M' conditions were as follows: lower plane, cool spot at left front corner, warm spot at right rear corner; mid-plane, quite uniform; upper plane, cool spot at left rear corner, hot spot at center. For oven M": lower plane, cool spot at left front corner; mid-plane, quite uniform; upper plane, cooler in rear, warm spot at center. For ovens N and ;O the temperatures were quite uniform on all three planes. The effect of, filling the crack around the oven door and removing all the insulation on oven M is evident in Figure 13. The change in surface temperatures is shown in Table 6. These data definitely show the ad - vantage of insulating the oven. ¦¦¦" ;¦. .- • The adaptation of the flow calorimeter as a means of measuring the quantity of heat lost from the oven vent was a method that was con - venient and simple to operate. The accuracy: that may be obtained would depend primarily upon the ability to read small changes in the temperature of the inlet and outlet water. Considering the thermometers used, a vanation|of 10 B.t.u. per hour in vent loss could be expected from the uncertainties in temperature readings beyond 0.1 ° C. This study of heat losses from oven M showed that most of the heat was being transmitted through the side walls, top, and doors Filling the crack around the door made very little difference in the heat-retaining quality of the oven. Thus, to improve the oven with regard to heat loss it would be^ necessary to improve the insulation of the side walls, top, and doors. While no data were obtained relative to the heat loss from the bottom of the oven, it was evident that considerable heat could escape there because ltwas covered only with the broiler drawer. It seems to the author that the heat loss from the present gas ovens is still rather high and that the oven should be better insulated so that the heat necessary to maintain the empty oven would be reduced to at least half the values shown in Figure 11. CONCLUSIONS _ From the detailed study of gas ranges, significant results have been obtained which may be expressed in the form of optimum requirements necessary to insure satisfactory performance for economical operation </seg>
         <seg id="p024">AcRICILTVRAL EXPERIMENT STATION RESEARCH BULLETIN 111 While the stoves were studied with natural gas as fuel, the results are applicable to manufactured and bottled gas because principles rather than individual stoves were studied. Optimum requirements of the cooking top: 1. The top burners should be of the non-clog type and should have a thermal efficiency of 50 per cent when operated with a five-quart aluminum pan having a bottom diameter of 7!4 inches. 2. The burners should have a wide heat spread so that a uniform heat distribution may be obtained with large utensils. 3. To insure high efficiency the cooking top should be the enclosed type having burner bowls as a part of the top. The top should be light - weight but sturdy. The grates should have as few prongs as necessary to support the pan and make contact with the top at only four points. Burners should be centered with respect to the burner bowls and grates. 4. The cooking top burner assemblies should produce no carbon monoxide. 5. To prevent crowding of large utensils, burners should be at least 10}4 inches apart, center to center, when measured across the front of the stove and from front to back. 6. At least two of the burners should be equipped with wide-heat - spread simmer burners built in the center of the regular burner. It should be possible to maintain a low heat with these simmer burners. Optimum requirements for ovens: 1. The oven burner should be capable of preheating the oven rapidly. A satisfactory heating rate would be one that would preheat the oven from room temperature to 500° F. in 15 minutes. 2. The oven burner should be capable of maintaining a constant temp - erature of 250° F. when the oven is empty. i. The heat should be controlled by a thermostat that will maintain temperatures to within ± 2 degrees F. for each dial setting. There should be no backlash in the dial mechanism. 4. The oven should be well insulated so that the heat necessary to maintain the empty oven would not exceed 3,000 B.t.u. per hour at 400° F. 5. The heat distribution in the oven should be uniform. Temperature gradients between different points in the oven should not exceed 10 degrees F. 6. The oven door should be tightly fitted but should not be clamped to make a tight fit. 7. To prevent crowding when the oven is fully loaded with six loaves of bread the interior oven dimensions should be at least 16 inches wide, 14 inches high, and 19 inches deep. Sufficient rack spacing should be provided so that bread on the bottom rack will not touch the top rack nor will bread on the top rack touch the top of the oven. [2J4MI </seg>
