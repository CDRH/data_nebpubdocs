When leather is subjected to heat, a chemical change takes place, al - though no change in appearan.ee may be noted at the time. Leather when burnt becomes dry and parched and will soon crack through like paste - board when strained. This applies to leather both in soles and uppers. When dried, the leather should always be treated with dressing and restore its pliability. Many shoes are burned while on the feet without knowledge of the wearer by being placed while wet on the rail of a stove or near a steam pipe.
