Hoefener By PRESIDENT WAKE: Gentlemen, we have something in store for you that is worth while, right at this time. . • You heard Mr. Truax this morning- for a short time (before the meeting of the County Fair Associations). He has kindly consented to talk to you again at this time. I am not going to take any more of his time. But I take pleasure in introducing to you Mr. Charles Truax of Ohio. • By MR. TRUAX: Mr. President, Mr. Secretary, Ladies and Gen - tlemen — This day will certainly be remembered by me as one of the busiest and most pleasant of my life. Since I arrived this morning I had the pleasure of meeting and having a chat with your governor, who is a member of this Board, and I have had the privilege of look - ing over and inspecting your state house. I want to commend every one who has in any way been connected with that project. In Ohio for the past six years we have been endeavoring to get a similar project under way. We have a state house that was built along in 1870; it is entirely inadequate now; in fact, not large enough to house even one state department. The last three general assemblies have appointed commissions, but no action has been taken. A bill was introduced just a few days ago in the present general* assembly to provide for an appropriation of five million dollars for a new state office-building, I had read a lot about the state house here; I have seen photographs of the building when it was to be completed, but I certainly want to say you are to be congratulated, all of you, the state legislature and all of the men who have taken a part in the completion of this new state capitol. I think it will perhaps be the finest in the United States when it is completed. . ■ Following this visit I was extended the courtesy of addressing your house of representatives and I found them most gracious and </seg>
            <seg id="p016">I REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE responsive indeed. From there I went down to the Rotary club, where I was accorded about thirty minutes to address that group consisting of approximately two hundred men who were there. So I say .this will go down in my life history as one of the busiest and most pleas - ant days. I was glad to come to. Lincoln because of some pleasant past associations here, as I said this morning. I have known your secretary of agriculture, Mr. McLaughlin, for several years. One year I met him in Chicago at the Association of Commissioners of Agriculture. He, I and Commissioner Jones of Wisconsin were se - lected to draft resolutions and when this committee of three met both Messrs. McLaughlin and Jones delegated the task to me, thus proving the old adage that a good committee is a committee of three of which only one functions. Of course, everybody knows your good secre - tary of the fair, Mr. George, Jackson, for wherever I go they ask about George Jackson, and he Us well and favorably known in the fair world. I just recalled a moment ago he used to breed hogs and had twenty-three pure bred hog sales. MR. JACKSON: How do you know I didn't have more than twenty-three ? i ■ ■ ' ' ■. MR. TRU AX (continuing): You bred the wrong color. I recall an occasion at Chicago when George met one of these high-pressure sales - men who wanted to sell him some high-protein superior ready-mixed feed. He went on extolling the virtues of this feed, showing how much more concentrated it was, so the hogs could assimilate it much better, and it was more digestible; gave the hogs much less work than any similar product and took up so much less time and served as a labor-saving device, but George ended the discourse by the remark, "I don't want any of it. What does a hog care about time, anyway?" Now, I want to begin where I left off this morning. I believe I got to the point where I announced my subject as "The Future of the State Fair." I believe at this point I was interrupted to go to your wonderful capitol building and receive the courtesy of addressing your house of representatives. Now, we will resume at that point: • An expression of opinion concerning the future of the state fair or a presentation of what the state fair might be in the future has about five chief features as I have it in mind: First— A brief review: concerning the origin of the fair or exposi - tion. Second — Why does the fair exist today? </seg>
            <seg id="p017">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Third — What is the purpose and mission of the fair? Fourth — Will the fair as we know it. today, be continued as a state and public institution? ... Fifth — What characteristics, changes, qualities and vision will be necessary to keep that fair abreast with the ever-changing and fast - moving world of the future?-. When fairs were first founded travel or transportation was anti - quated and confined chiefly to beasts of burden. Communication was primitive and slow. Clearly because of these handicaps of a growing civilization, the early? fair enjoyed a much more distinctive niche in the progress of that civilization than does the fair of today in our civilization. Fairs and expositions always have been and always will be clearing houses of ideas, presenting a clear exposition of state or national progress and achievement and making possible valuable con - tact, not only between urban, rural and industrial groups, but between the various businesses and professions as well. The early fairs were, perhaps, a necessity because of the lack of transportation or com - munication facilities as we know them more latterly or modernly. Why do the state and other fairs exist today, not merely because of the" survival and perpetuation of an ancient custom and an ancient institution?' No, the fair exists, first: Because it occupies a distinctively valuable place in the field of agricultural education. In the United States as a whole, two thousand six hundred separate institutions attest to the faith of the American people in the county, independent and state fairs and despite Tfie occa - sional observation that the day of the fair is passe, the opposite of this is true, for interest in fairs can be shown to be increasing rather than decreasing. Methods of communication and travel have changed the scene considerably,* and our contacts are much more varied and fre - quent than they used to be in the days when we looked forward to driving to the fair in the buggy or going on an excursion train for the high spots of the year in the way of instruction and amusement. The state fair of today, as much as it ever was, is still a great stimulus to agricultural endeavor. It still makes for progress by comparison of what this man or that man has done as against the achievement cf some one else. It has been figured that approximately eighty per cent of what we learn comes to us through the eye, i. e., what we learn is eighty, per cent visual education. That is the real </seg>
            <seg id="p018">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ' reason why the fail* isj so valuable as an educational institution. It deals not in theory, but in object lessons. As someone has said, "Every fair has its object lessons." Every fair as it presents the' actual article or animal for comparison and study, gives an implied challenge to anyone else to produce as good or better if he can. There are in Ohio eighty-five county fairs and eighteen inde - pendent fairs. ■ • ■ No other single seasonal attraction in my state can compare with the county fair in the amount of patronage it enjoys. More than one - third of the population^ of tti e state, that is to say, more than two million people attend our county fairs each year. The value of the fairs in Ohio, including both county and independent organizations, total $4,200,000. Incidentally, the county fair plans of the country at large have a total valuation of around $170,000,000. In 1928 the gate receipts for our Ohio county fairs totaled approximately $525,000.00. County fairs in Ohio also received from the counties through special levy, a total of approximately $175,000. The various fair boards ex - pended for repairs, improvements or new buildings about $120,000, for advertising, newspaper and general, about $58,000. Total premium offerings were $350,000/ Seven thousand horses -were shown, 10,000 cattle, 10,000 swine, 14,000 sheep, and 50,000 exhibits of -various farm products. • . The average county fair in Ohio was established about 1869, on 41.74 acres of ground in its fair plant, valued at $65,000 as an aver - age of 408 exhibitors, and attended by 20,000 people, and gate receipts of $15,000. From the foregoing it is not difficult to perceive that the county fair is not only a valuable and ever-increasing asset to the particular community in which it is held and upon which it thrives, but also these county fairs may be termed as feeders for the state fair of each respective state. There is the open forum at the county fairs for the battle between those who wish to' compete at the state fair. Here occurs the elimination contests. Those that can stand the acid test at the better and larger county fairs are in turn sent off .to the state fairs for the final and great test. Here it is that, the more prosperous and aggressive exhibitors, boys' and girls' clubs and others, and patrons, become fair enthusiasts and boosters and receive the stimulus and incentive that later sends them on to' the state fair as patrons and exhibitors there. Then again, the fair exists today because agriculture is still the basic occupation in any nation and any civilization. The economic and </seg>
            <seg id="p019">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE '" ■ ■■■■• '••- •'■.-.; ■■■•■/' ' ■ -■".■• k social structure is dependent upon the welfare of agricultural pursuit; laborer, teacher, scientist, poet, — all have to be fed and clothed. Only after successful agriculture, resulting in material well-being, is the leisure and opportunity for the culture and civilization which embrace the higher things of mind and soul to be developed. Because in the colonization and development of any new land, agriculture is the most immediate necessary and convenient occupation, we find invariably a large farming population. That accounts for the larger percentage of the country's population being found on the farm in our own colonial period, say, roughly, three-fourths of the people. Today we find the situation reversed. The professions and trades other than agriculture have been so developed and the immediate wage Teturns, as a rule, so much more definite and attractive, that our towns have steadily drained our rural sections of their greatest resource, its young men- and women. Today, therefore, we discover that the coun - try sections are undermanned, and that in' pljce of an evenly dis - tributed population we have great metropolitan centers of population situated in comparatively sparsely settled agricultural sections. If agriculture is important in the settling of a country, it is also important in tnat country after colonization period. Not only has our population increased enormously, but the individual standard of living has been raised all along the line. The problem is vastly differ - ent; the amount of land is a fixed factor; thejiumber of mouths to be fed is constantly on the increase. Clearly^ie only solution to the problem is better agriculture, making two") or perhaps five or six, • plants grow where only one grew before. The general formula is training; intelligently trained farming, the conversion of farming from a haphazard partnership with nature to a business and a science. In America we have met the question of man power shortage with notable success by the use of agricultural machinery. But there is a limit to the possibilities along this line. Machinery can never take the place of living, breathing, intelligent, energetic, earnest men and women. The problem is still a grave one, as I see it. Agricul - ture, successful, progressive American agriculture, cannot forever stand this constant drain on her youthful man' power. '■* * The hope of our agriculture lies today in. the farm boy and the farm girl. Anything which can be done to demonstrate conclusively to them that the farm offers them a healthier; happier, a more pros - perous life than they may obtain in the cities, makes a distinct and </seg>

' '■ ( REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The state fair of the future must super-industrialize, commercial - ize and amusementize. All fairs were originally conceived for the ex - ploitation of agriculture; that agricultural exploitation must be the fundamental purpose of every state fair in the future, an agricultural educational institution where the farms can display ; the products of the soil, of animal husbandry, the. products of the farm home and of the boys and girls, it must still be a place for the manufacturer, the merchant, the dealer from the town and cities to attractively display his wares and products. The fair will still wield a powerful influence in molding the opinion of its patrons. It will be a valuable medium for the bringing together of the rural trade and urban trade, for a coalition exhibit of the products of the farm and the products of urban industry; for an interpretation of agricultural opinions and urban opinions. This influence can be for good or bad, progressive or retroactive, desirable or undesirable, uplifting or" degrading, depending upon the quality, standard and moral character of the institution. If the exhibit smacks of inferiority, then that effect will hardly be less unfavorable upon the. visitors than upon the exhibitors themselves. If the exhibi - tions do not attract the best citizens of the state, then' that is bound to have an unwholesome effect upon the entire citizenship of that state. The chief articles of food emanating directly from the farm are cereals, fruits and vegetables, the fair must lead in these displays. As bread is the staff of life, so is beef and pork the fuel for sus - taining the fires of human activity, so must we excel in these exhibits. Wool will continue to be the basic material for clothing, therefore the sheep show must be unrivaled and unsurpassed, and since the hcrse will continue to be a big factor in the motive power on the farm and in the city, "and the saddle and fine harness horse a source of recreation for many and the horse races attractive to the fans, these departments must continue to be expanded and bettered. . And yet, because of this very pre-eminent agricultural leadership many people conceive the idea that the fair is only a pumpkin show. They admit we have fine cows, good pigs and wonderful horses, but have nothing to attract the city folks, not the right kind of entertain - ment, diversion or amusement. Hence the admonition to commercialize, industrialize and amusementize. Industry demands more, better and larger exhibits. Exhibitors and patrons alike demand mere breathing space or ground room. | Charge for space must, of necessity,' be higher to balance the in - creased investment in plant equipment.- I see the possibility of higher </seg>

The state fair is the only institution that still presents a $1 50 show for 50 cents. The extra money can well be used for better buildings, equipment, and better expositions. By all means present some new outstanding feature each year. At least give that feature a new name, a new appearance, a new dressing. To compete with the city amusements, we must have entertainment programs, vaudeville and hippodrome acts, j music and races that compare favorably in quality, character and magnitude with those city attractions. They must be attractions with a kick and a punch. No longer does the nation devote its time and thought to the burning social, moral and political issues of the day, while the flame of patriotism mounts to manhood s cheek, red as the fires of Troy. It revels In amusement and entertainment. A well-meaning minister, complaining to the editor of a city paper concerning the publicity given to sport events asked when they would ;give the same amount of space to the churches that they did to the baseball games. The editor replied, "Whenever the churches have to bujld bleachers to accommodate their patrons." Because of historical precedent and the loathness of people or citizens to tear down or destroy an old established institution. Next because of those interested— the various governmental departments state legislatures, governors, state boards of agriculture, secretaries directors and managers— will keep the fires of the fairs of the future burning. Finally, the boys and girls of today who will become the men and women of tomorrow. The 4-H clubs whose symbol is the head, the heart, the hand, the health. If you will pardon the personal allus.cn again, I will say that the Ohio state fair has recognized the very importance of this agricultural progress and for several years has been a leader in the field of boys' and girls' club work. In 1926 two splendid brick and steel buildings were constructed for the bovs' and girls' department. ,The entry list in this department is as large as that enjoyed by any other state fair, and larger than the majority of them. The whole program of boys' and girls' work seems to me to be the best test we have in .interesting our young folks these days on the farm. It is an old observation that the boy who has had instilled in him an interest in pure bred livestock by having his own livestock project, or by being given a financial interest in his father's livestock is not nearly so liable to tire of the farm as the one who is an unpaid chore boy or a farm hand which happens to be in the family. One of the finest ways to interest the farm boy or girl in the value of pure bred livestock and a better agriculture, horticulture, floraculture and farm land is in the 4-H club movement, for in the final analysis farms </seg>

REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE are something: more than mere graneries from which the cities are to be fed; they are reservoirs of citizenship, the bulwark of our national institution and one of the greatest crops produced on American farms year after year had been a surplus of young men, and those young ' men the most forward, the most enterprising, have gone off the farm to rejuvenate the tired blood of the cities. The state fair must help maintain these reservoirs of citizenship, then that citizenship in - turn emanating from those reservoirs will have to maintain the state fair in the future. If for no other reason, the state, fairs of this country will continue to flourish and prosper because of the love, energy and devotion of the men whom I am addressing today, the cause which they serve and the industry which they represent. You fair men have, in addition to your official duties, fostered and promoted the cause of human fellow - ship. Give the public what the public wants. Of course maintain the high educational character of the exposition. In the industrial exhibit, keep abreast with the times. Two successful aircraft shows have been held in Ohio and within a few years this attraction will be a fixed feature of every large state fair. Secure the latest in machinery, | industrial as well as agricultural. But remember, when evening ap - ; proaches, people want relaxation, recreation and entertainment. Build and produce night shows that are meritorious and attractive. Results cannot be expected from night shows that consist only of dull pageantry or a conglomeration of 'mediocre acts. Build and produce night shows that either have a continuity of theme, including high class acts and outstanding features, such as may be found in the best features down town. Pageantry, music, vaudeville, fireworks and the midway, all have their place and will continue to be featured at every good fair. Not one of these, however, is complete in itself without the inclusion of some of the others. In 1926 I produced a musical extravaganza as the grandstand offering with a cast of two thousand, including a sym - phony band of 150 pieces, a chorus of 300 voices, a ballet of 200, ten big-time vaudeville and circus acts, concluding with a spectacular fire - works finale. This was one of the first outdoor productions to be • staged using the spoken word and dramatic syncronization by aid of electric amplification. The same lighting and scenic effects were provided as are found in the best theatres. The worth of the production was attested to by the largest attendance and cash receipts up to that time. The follow - ing year a rodeo and stampede was the featured attraction of the fair and constituted the entire night show at the grandstand. Equipment, </seg>

Two hundred and fifty brcncos. 150 head of wild steers, cows and calves were shipped in from Canada to stage the production. Twenty thousand dollars in prizes and purses were allotted and more than 100 cowboys, the cham - pions of the southwest and northwest, competed for the prizes. The show lasted for two hours of thrills and spills. The ambulance was used at every performance;, fortunately, however, not an accident was fatal. That was what the public wanted — the element of danger, riding; on mankillers and wrestling a long-horned steer, or the wild, horse race provided a kick that the public wanted and the program was interspersed with comedy numbers. One of the advantages of this sort of show is that it can be staged rain or shine. The grand - stand and bleacher seats were filled every night. ■ On three nights standing room was sold in the race track oval and on Thursday night nearly five thousand paid for standing room at $1.00 each. To;al cash receipts were 40 per cent more than the previous record year, and the universal opinion was that the entertainment was an unqualified suc - cess. This year, the night program started with a concert of one hour •by Jchn Phillip Sousa and his famous band of nearly one hundred pieces. Then a colorful and pleasing review by Ernie Young, inter - spersed with vaudeville and hippodrome acts, concluding with a mag - nificent fireworks spectacle by Gordon. As in the previous years, capacity houses were noted each time. Special mention should be given Sousa and his band, who played two concerts each afternoon at the grandstand. Without question, this is the greatest drawing card of al!. For fcur years, a three-hundred-piece high school band has been recruited from nearly every county in the state. These boys are fitted with uniforms, and give daily concerts at noon in the state house yard at Columbus, proving a. great publicity medium, not only during the week of the fair, but during the four weeks of preparation pre - ceding the fair in their local communities. Also the night horse show, vaudeville, circus and hippodrome acts in the coliseum continue to draw capacity houses of ten thousand people per night. Radio broad - casting stations have been in use the. last few years and the amplifica - ticn system was extended this year to include ten stations located in various sections, covering the entire ground. Build this kind of a show, then advertise it, use newspaper space as plentifully as funds will permit, especially in the papers scattered throughout the rural sections of the state. Secure the good-will of the editors, invite their ccoperaticn, . suggestions and advice. Designate one of the days as "press day," give them a, luncheon and a banquet and admission and free access for themselves, families and friends to all attractions on the ground.

Treat the newspapers in this manner and for every dollar expended in paid publicity they will give you three dollars worth of free publicity. Use. outdoor ad - vertising of course, billboards, attractive posters and tack signs. In Ohio we use 10,000 metal arrow signs or indicators that are attached to the 'road markers on the state highway and point the way to Columbus. Our main .highways in all counties are covered in this manner. Six weeks prior to the fair, a "State Fair News" is pub - lished, which goes to a selected mailing list of enthusiasts and boosters for the fair. In this manner exhibits, attendance and cash receipts have been built -up year by year until the maximum was reached in 1928, despite the adverse, economic conditions that prevailed in our agricultural sections. If- my prophecy of a continued deficit and impoverished agriculture should prove untrue, then your troubles will be lessened, your task less difficult. The world likes success, but will' only sympathize with failure. People are not attracted to exhibits of livestock; grain, horticulture when they know that most products come from a losing and impoverished industry. The remedy is obvi - ous — lift the industry on which your fairs are built to the same level of economic equality; to the same high rank of industrial activities and standards of living, then your fairs will progress and prosper. Now, I cannot conclude without taking this opportunity to take up with you some practical problems faced by agriculture, which may be a little away from the subject of fairs, but the interests of agricul - ture are too much interwoven with fairs for them to be very far off the subject. As most of you know, the grand champion steer at the Inter - national Livestock Show this year was produced by a twelve-year old bey living en a farm in Iowa. What an incentive and what a stimula - tion to farm youth of this country to know of this great achievement. I also want to offer a similar credit to my own state. Many of you no doubt know that the world's champion corn grower lives in Ohio, Ira Marshall. His farm is in a county that adjoins mine. Far the past four years his yield of corn has exceeded any. other yield ever pro - duced. Operating a farm of a . hundred and eighty acres that had been an onion farm, breaking up the muck onion soil. In 1925 he had lost his entire onion crop, it being destroyed in. the first week in June by a hail storm. He planted all of that in corn and that year broke the world's repord by producing sixteen hundred bushels of corn on ten acres. In 1926 he ran sixteen hundred and seventy bushels on ten acres. And in 1927 averaged a little less, being around fifteen hun- </seg>

In 1928 he broke his own former record by producing over seventeen hundred bushels for ten acres of land. In addition to that he had one hundred acres of corn on the same farm, in 1928, that produced better than one hundred bushels per acre. In addition to all he has a son now twenty-one years old and a daughter, nineteen years old, who have also been producing record yields. In 1928 the son produced 1,584 bushels on ten acres and the daughter produced 1,540 bushels. Every bushel, of this corn is checked and verified by the officers of the Ohio State . University. They have in Hardin county more than one hundred farm boys and girls who have qualified for the 100-bushel .corn club. To my mind this is one of the finest examples of what results there are before us in the way of being more efficient in farm production. How is it done? First, it is done by finding out about your pure seed corn. Every inch of this ground, after careful preparation, is planted to pure seed corn. Scrub. seed corn occupies just as inefficient and disreputable a place as scrub livestock in that industry. A maxi - mum use of good barnyard manure, the best fertilizer and nitrate of soda. The most efficient farming is sought — this work is done by power farming. I give this as an illustration of what there is in store for the youth of the American farm today. Now, I cannot close without going into another phase of agricul - tural problems. Were not there an extreme economic depression . in American agriculture of recent years we might not have been striv - ing so hard to reach s.ome of these goals. Were it not for this de - pression our fairs would perhaps have assumed more magnitude and taken their place faster' as a large exposition not only showing agri - cultuie and livestock, but of the most progressive thought of the day. In our county fairs and state fairs, undoubtedly the best work of bringing results from the soil itself comes from the boys and girls in the 4-H clubs. I don't want to dwell too long on this subject, my friends, or you may say of me like_, they did of a fellow who once was making a lecture on the evils of Volsteadism, opposing it, of course, and some - one remarked that he was "too full of his subject" I don't want you to say that about me. Nor do I want to be classed with a friend of mine who made quite a good many speeches at meetings like this and at banquets and other occasions. Jn every speech, he made, no matter what the occasion was or what subject was given to him, before he was tnVough he always quoted from Patrick Henry.- One evening they had him on a toast list and they figured they would stump him for once, so they did not tell him what his subject was until they </seg>
            <seg id="p029">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE called on him and then when he was introduced it was announced that he would speak on "Microbes." They figured he couldn't in any way hook up microbes with Patrick Henry. But alas, he started out: "Ladies and Gentlemen, I have been assigned the subject, to tell you what microbes are — they are little bugs walking back and forth in a man's stomach, hollering out Patrick Henry's immortal words, 'Give me liberty or give me death'." So no matter on what sort of an occasion I make a speech I cannot resist an impulse to say something about af»ii culture. So I want to say, before I conclude, that in my judgment American agriculture, financially speaking, is at this time at the lowest ebb in all of its history. . We have heard a lot about farm relief. I suppose there is no one who has talked farm relief more than I have. There • probably never has been a term more used or harder abused than this term "Farm Relief." The farmers of this country are not seeking temporary relief. They are seeking permanent equality with . other industries; an opportunity to share in whatever degree- of prosperity we attain in this nation. The owner of lands wants a dividend each year on his investment just the same as the banker, manufacturer, public utility stockholder, railroad bondholder, all of whom expect and receive a dividend on their investments. • . This morning in addressing your house of representatives I men - tioned the- fact that yesterday there appeared before one of the con - gressional committees a representative of the steel industry of this country. He presented a request for an increase in the tariff on steel. You may remember that two or three years ago, and I am not offering this in a spirit of criticism, but merely to give you a recital of facts, that when the first farm relief bill was passed that it was blocked, but an increase was granted on the tariff for pig iron. Yesterday they were asking for. more tariff and whereas the present tariff is high as we figure it, they want it increased. I am not saying their request is not justified. They will probably get it. They are organ - ized and have influence. But the United States Steel Corporation in 1926 declared a dividend of forty per .cent on their entire investment. They represent an industry of four and one-half billions of dollars. They affect directly only one and one-half millions of people. Yet they get what they ask for. They are already prosperous. ... •'■•'.'■'■ &gt; Two years ago the United States government finished paying the last of the railroad claims, amounting to nearly six hundred millions of dollars. That was done out of the treasury, given to the railroads as a bonus or subsidy to redeem contracts or promises made to them </seg>
            <seg id="p030">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE . during the war, but the railroads affect directly only eleven per cent of the people in this country. Agriculture affects directly and indirectly fifty millions of people. I know our farm population is only thirty-five million now, but I am talking about both the rural communities and the towns under a thousand population. Every merchant, country banker and laborer is absolutely dependent on the farm for his own welfare. So this industry affects at least fifty millions of people. If this industry had been paid out of the federal . treasury on the same basis as the rail - roads were, which affect eleven per cent of the people, we would have had to be paid — the farm industry of this country — more than three billions of dollars and, of course, the farmers are not asking that. - We know that we have the satisfaction of not supporting or re - ceiving any legislation ;that is economically unsound or that is class legislation. But let me [say to you, friends, that every man and. every woman connected with ] or interested • in county fairs or state fairs ought to be active in support of farm relief legislation. ■ Nothing in all the world will stimulate your fairs so much as an increased agri - cultural prosperity. I can remember back just about eight years ago when we had a sort of la land aristocracy in this country, when farm lands were selling for $500 or $600 or $700 an acre. Livestock on the farms, hogs, cattle and other stock were the aristocrats of the pure bred world and were selling for $5000 a head. I know that to be true because I sold some myself at that price. Many head were selling at $10,000, $15,000 to $25,000. Those figures are something to conjure with, my friends. The nation and the world is interested in profits and prosperity in business. The world applauds success. It only sympathizes with failure. Those were days when we had $10,000 bulls and $5,000 boars' on display. Then the city people, the men of capital, of industry, came to our fairs to see those exhibits. In many cases they became interested and they bought such animals; they bought farms. Now since the .depression most of those are down to normal market prices arid those people are not interested in our live-' stock and they are not interested in our farms, nor in pur land today. I don't know what the particular conditions are in your state, but in many states the more land a man owns now it is that much greater liability to him. Isn't that a paradoxical situation? Is it unfair and an unjust situation? For us to know that the real producer, who feeds this nation, who. is the producer of the food that the nation eats; who produces the raw materials from which the clothing of the nation is made; that such producers must continue to produce at a financial loss to themselves, while those who benefit therefrom con - tinue to reap their enormous economic profits. Why do it? </seg>
            <seg id="p031">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OK ACRlqULTURE We produce in this country each year a certain amount of wealth; let's say it is about ninety billions per year. That is a fixed quantity. There is not much less nor much more, taken year in and year out. Now then, at the present time nearly 83 per cent of this wealth is going into the large industrial centers representing only 15 per cent cf our population. In 1920 the distribution of this wealth was evenly divided or proportioned; about fifty-fifty between the agricultural industry and all other industries of the country. As a matter of \ fact and of record the agricultural industry at that time was worth seventy-eight billions of dollars, while all of the other industries of the country were worth only seventy-three billions of dollars. Now the agricultural industry is worth fifty billions of dollars and all of jthe other industries are worth one hundred billions of dollars. So much for this situation. Yet it shows an unbalanced ratio of 15 per cent of cur people securing 83 per cent while the agricultural industry loses the lion's share which properly belongs to it. Just as I said to the Rotary Club this noon, that our great cities are building themselves at the expense of our broad prairies; that the tall skyscrapers of a city like New York are pyramiding one upon another; that they are threatening to destroy a fine fabric of American life — of our agricultural life. They are endangering our citizenship. This is nothing now. Twenty-eight, hundred years ago Solon, a Greek philosopher, gave a warning in almost the same lan - guage as to the danger to. Greek agriculture. One of his statements was: "Agricultural pauperism is a cancerous growth in Greece, and that cancer will pull down the nation with it." History tells the same story, the histoi-y of all great nations is that having subordinated agriculture to industry, the same result has followed. In 1848 Eng - land deliberately subordinated agriculture for industry when she adopted her . corn laws. Today she is sorry of that policy and is burdened with dcleism. . She has her unemployed to feed. In this great era of industrialism our manufacturer can determine his pro - duction' program in advance. He can figure his. costs and carry that program out doivn to the ton, the piece or the pound or to the Ford car. But that, 'the farmer cannot do. He may plant one hundred million acres and get a three billion bushel crop, it; all depends en the season. The manufacturer can determine his production costs in advance, or within a few cents and figure his unit of .production. The . farmer cannot determine his production costs because the season determines both his yield and his costs. The manufacturer can determine his sales and fix his prices in advance and if his sales sort of lag he can force them or maintain his price. The farmer can decide, on all cf the selling prices he </seg>
            <seg id="p032">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE pleases, but finally someone else makes the price at which he sells. The manufacturer can 1 speed up production, he may do something to increase the demand and maintain a higher price or go to some, other market. The farmer cannot speed up his production, but if it falls short or fails he must wait a month or another year before he can plan a new program. I ■ . ' Any time prices are not satisfactory or other conditions are too adverse the manufacturer can shut down his factory and lay off the hands and get rid of the expense, except, a certain fixed overhead. The farmer can do nothing of the sort. His production will be what it will be despite his efforts once the seed is in the ground, so when - ever anyone makes the statement that the afflictions of this ! great agricultural problem can be cured by adjusting the production, by diversification, by better methods of marketing, or better methods of farming, we can simply say that one of two things is true, either he . don't know what he is talking about or for reasons best known to himself he is deliberately trying to deceive the public. So our slogan should be, my friends, "Protection for all or protection for none." ... . . I want to say this, in the past we have petitioned and our peti - tions have been disregarded. We have entreated and our entreaties have been scorned. We have begged and they have mocked. We are through with that; we jhave passed beyond that; and I say to every man and every woman who is interested in the future, in the salva - tion of the American agriculture; to every man and every woman who has their money invested in farm lands as we have; to every - father and mother who have boys and girls coming up on the farm, I say that their slogan and our slogan in the future should be this: "We petition no . more. We entreat no more. We beg no more. We defy. We demand equality for American agriculture with you." By MR. L. E.

' . ■ SECRETARY'S REPORT FOR 1928 As secretary of the State ' Board of Agriculture, according to custom, it becomes my duty to review the work intrusted to us and recommend a course to those to follow. The 1928 State Fair was an inovaticn in many respects. It is indeed a pleasure to know that the new activities and improvements tried out for the first time were all a wonderful success. The new Burlington spur and platform, the many new gates and taxi zone, hooking up all the large buildings with the public address system, the eight'day fair and the circus were all satisfactory and very highly commended by the patrons. Without any question of doubt the past State Fair was one of the most successful from an educational standpoint, ever held in the state., The agricul - tural, horticultural, live stock, dairy, machinery and all other exhibits were in perfect harmony and in keeping with the ideal fair. The educational exhibits were most excellent and demonstrated in such a way that the results of- the exhibit will have their effect upon this and future generations. The citizens of the state appreciate the efforts made to entertain and instruct. The attendance was so large it was impossible to do them justice. While the grounds were full to over - flowing, the patrons were good natured and pleased, expressing them - selves in words and actions that could not be misunderstood. We have gained an enviable record in attendance, being first in per capita attendance, first in daily attendance of any eight-day fair and first in average annual attendance for the last five years of any other fair. .1 . Fairs and expositions have always been classed as great educa - tional institutions as well as outstanding advertising . mediums, and in all of our advertising we put out we emphasized that fact. One of our advertising slogans was, "The Greatest Educational Fair in the United^States." We find this to be an interesting subject with lots of food for thought. In the last few years we have given a great deal of organized thought to this one feature and the more thought we give it, the more we realize that it is just as necessary to educate the patrons of the fair how best to accept the program as it is for us to '. exhibit it. Of course one of the most perplexing problems that con - fronts every fair management today, is how best to stage the exhibits to drive home most effectively the great object of the show. Every department should reach out, inspire and benefit all classes. People are like instruments, they must be tuned and in order for the patrons to get the best results from the exhibits and program, they must be in harmony. So it is necessary to start this tuning process months </seg>

REPORT QF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE , 1|- . ■ ■ ■ before the fair opens; It is not enough to let our people know that you are going to have a fair, but they must be educated to want to come; that alone takes months to do. One of the most important lessons that a fair can teach is the value of persistent effort in striving: toward a goal and the boy and girl or an exhibitor at; any age, who fails to win a prize and yet who has learned this lesson will be the winner in later contests. Failure after failure have been instrumental in the making of many an out - standing character, the fellow who keeps everlastingly at it is the winner in the final analysis. -Some will say the fair only lasts one week in the year; the educational value of the fair extends through - out the entire year. It is at the State Fair where we are inspired for next year; he who has learned by persistent effort will work throughout the year to win and reach his climax at the next fair. It is not always the winner by any means that gets the most out of the competition at the Fair. The loser, if he is a student, will receive benefit in short cuts lor new methods, new ideas, new conceptions, which aro worth more to him than the premium. It is the doing of a thing which counts and the prize won is only evidence that you have made a success. The fair is a test of methods as these can be known only by re - sults. Merchants in our larger cities realize the importance of their display windows, many claiming these display windows must at least pay the rent of the building, so consequently their window decorator holds one of the important positions. We find exhibitors that make our state fairs and pay a substantial rental for - space to exhibit in, then fail completely, for their methods of displaying their exhibit would fail to attract attention. So if state fairs are to continue to be great educational institutions they must teach the lessons of per - sistent effort along- with! new ideas and new methods, they must keep in advance of the times and go hand in hand with the state they represent. You cannot speak of one without advertising the other. It would be a difficult problem to even guess with any degree of cer - tainty as to what proportion of the progress which has been made in Nebraska is due to ttie fairs held in the state, but it is safe to say that fairs have contributed very largely toward the development and no doubt they will take a more important part, in the progress of Nebraska's future. • '-■••■■•• I The following table shows the number of cars from the forty-one foreign states attending the 1928 Nebraska State Fair: </seg>

            <seg id="p041">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE need not, expect a large horse show. The interest in draft horses will never be the same as fifteen years ago, but many are interested as evidenced by the continuous string of people that visited the horse barns daily. Needless to say, the Shetland pony division attracted a great deal of attention and contained many interesting exhibits. There were 44 more entries in the pony division this year than in 1927. BEEF CATTLE '" ■ . **- As a result of increased premiums the - showing of beef cattle, especially Herefords and Shorthorns, was vastly superior to that made during the several years preceding. There were very few poorly fitted animals on display, and the exhibit throughout was such as to attract very favorable comment from the tremendous throngs of people who passed through the barns and witnessed the judging in the Coliseum. The showing of fat steers was stronger than it has been for some time. While there were not as many Aberdeen Angus as there were of the Shorthorn and Hereford breeds, nevertheless there were some high quality animals in the exhibit, and in all classes the champions were very strong. Premiums paid in 1928 compared with those paid in 1927 were as follows: in 1927 cash premiums for beef breeds of cattle were $6,604.00 and in .1928 the premiums amounted to $9,795.00, which was won by twenty-nine Nebraska breeders and twenty-three foreign exhibitors. One of the most pleasing features in connection with the showing of cattle and horses in the Coliseum was the use of the new ampli - fiers. This permitted the promotion of the educational features of the show. The spectators in the Coliseum were afforded an opportunity to understand just what was being done in the several judging rings and called attention to the winning animals in each class. This feature very much appreciated and considerable favorable comment was heard regarding it. ■ * '■' DAIRY CATTLE While the dairy interest in Nebraska seems to be increasing, our entry books do not show that there was any material increase in the number of exhibits. Our books show there were 372 entries in 1927 and 373 entries in 1928. We paid $3,454.00 in premiums in 1927 and $4,310.00 in 1928. There were twenty-seven Nebraska breeders and thirteen foreign breeders exhibiting in this department this year. « . SWINE Nebraska farmers raise _one.-tenth of all the pork raised in the United States and the swine exhibit at the fair this year spoke elo- </seg>
            <seg id="p042">REPORT QF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE quently of the quality that is being: raised in this state. So it is no wonder that the . swine barn was crowded from early morning until night. We heard comments upon the quality of the hogs on exhibition this year, there seemed to be a greater per cent of large hogs than ever before, quite a number weighing 1,000 pounds and over. There were five breeds represented, the Hampshires were in the lead with 225 entries, Poland China next with 216 entries, Spotted Poland China with 190 entries, Duroc Jersey with 182 entries and Chester White with 160 entries. The average of the show was very high and there were, many choice animals bought to go into neighboring states. SHEEP In no department was there so appreciable an improvement both in size and quality of exhibits as in the sheep* division. A new classi - fication and premium list was adopted for this year's fair and this . proved to be exceedingly attractive to sheep men both from within and without the state. As a result, we had the finest sheep show which has ever been held at jour fair. Professor Harry Reed, of the Kansas Agricultural College, who judged both the 1927 and 1928 shows, was very profuse in his compliments regarding the tremendous improve - ment in the show and stated that in most classes he found exceed - ingly strong competition -and individuals of outstanding merit to head the classes. There were 546 entries which drew $2,102 in premiums. The breeders were enthusiastic in their praise for the much needed improvement made in the building and of their treatment by the super - intendent and the Board of Managers. MILCH GOATS After testing the samples of goat milk and being told the advan - tages of goat culture, many people who thought they had a prejudice against goat milk, went away from the goat show with different ideas. The industry is steadily growing all over the country and the number of profitable goat herds is increasing in Nebraska. Thousands of samples of milk were given out each day. POULTRY SHOW We thought the poultry show for last year could not be beat, but it was bigger and better than in 1927. Every standard breed was represented; 1,201 entries were made with over 2,000 birds, and why not? Nebraska is a poultry state and her poultry products produce annually something like fifty millions of dollars. Hence the State Fair poultry show was representative of such an industry. From early </seg>
            <seg id="p043">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE morn until late at night a constant stream of humanity poured through the building. There are probably more people interested in poultry than any other industry on the farm. The turkey production is an industry that is being brought to the front in Nebraska, especially so in western Nebraska. Miniature brooder houses, fences, feeding yards made up a part of the Extension Department exhibit, while enlarged pictures showing the turkey houses and flocks gave an idea of what a real turkey farm is like. ' RABBITS AND FUR BEARING ANIMALS The State Rabbit Association made a very creditable show again this year. It was much larger than previous years. For lack of room in the poultry house it was necessary to take this exhibit to the Sheep Barn. The fur-bearing animals were well represented, there are several fur-bearing animal farms in the state and it seems to be a growing in - dustry in Nebraska. It might be well to classify this industry and offer prizes to encourage this work. . . . AGRICULTURAL EXHIBIT Besides the wonderful display of corn, wheat, big pumpkins and long grass, the agricultural display this year furnished an exhibit of information in such an attractive way that every visitor wanted to stop and study, to look and learn. There was something more than a display of grains, grasses and vegetables, each exhibit was educational in itself, more attention was given to artistic arrangement and to emphasizing in some graphic way the agricultural specialty of each county exhibit. The result was a hall full of interest to the majority of the visitors as well as to those professionals who are interested only in the champion corn, wheat and vegetables. A miniature train in the Dawson county exhibit buzzed busily along all week carrying that county's tremendous export of alfalfa hay. Dawson people knew for a long time that theirs is the largest alfalfa hay producing county in the world and now there are at least 400,000 fair visitors who also know it. Instead of satisfying themselves by festooning a few bunches of alfalfa hay upon the walls of the Agricul - tural Hall for the majority of the visitors to ignore entirely, they made the fair guests stop to watch the little train, then the most of them walked inside the little green house made of baled alfalfa hay and once inside these facts were impressed upon them. 'Statistics show that if all the hay produced in Dawson county in one year were loaded in box ■cars, ten ton to the car, the train would contain 18,000 cars and would </seg>
            <seg id="p044">REPORT OF NKHRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE I - . ' - ■ make a train that would reach from Grand Island to Omaha. We all know now that Dawson county is a hay county. Deuel county is a wheat county, a miniature grain elevator worked at a threshing- day pace all during- the fair and every visitor who strolled along this exhibit stopped before that little elevator long enough to read that in 1927 one farmers' elevator handled more wheat in one day than any other elevator in the United States, 796 truck loads or 47,760 bushels. Those that visited the Agricultural Hall now have a firmly set idea that Deuel county I raises some wheat. A monstrous loaf of bread gracing the mound of golden wheat had the same effect upon the visitors marching past the Kimball county exhibit as a stop button on a city street. They all observed that Kimball county is a wheat county. Many other exhibits should be mentioned, but space will not permit. There were 28 counties competing, their winnings are determined by points and were as follows: Eastern District — Douglas first, 1,571 points; Washington second, 1,489 points; Merrick third, 1,214 points; Lancaster fourth, 1,106 points; Madison fifth, 840 points; Richardson sixth, 483 points. Central District — Adams first, 1,037 points; Kearney second, 1,020 points; Clay third, 843 points; Dawson fourth, 715 points; Polk fifth, 519 points; j Phelps sixth, 486 points; Thayer seventh, 347 points. Western District — Scotts Bluff first, 951 points; Kimball second, 775 points; Sioux third, 761 points; Lincoln fourth, 624 points; Red Willow fifth, 508 points; Cheyenne sixth, 453 points; Deuel seventh, 168 points. HORTICULTURE EXHIBIT &lt; The apple crop was short last year on account of late spring freezes, but it wasn't noticeable in the exhibit A very unusual dis - play of apples was arranged by the State Horticultural Society. A huge ear of corn, each kernel represented by a smooth green apple, was the center of attraction in the fruit exhibit, built around this was a fine display of almost! every variety of apples grown in Nebraska. Orchards in the southeastern part of the state are very profitable where they are properly cared for. If good young healthy trees are set out on good rich soil and cultivated as you would expect to do with other crops, you may expect a good yearly income in a short time; according to Mr. Hoppert, secretary of the State Horticultural Society, an orchard will last for thirty years. The commercial orchards are increasing in acreage in Nebraska, but the home fruit lots are rapidly disappearing. The average farmer feels that it is cheaper to go out and buy a few barrels of apples each winter than to grow them </seg>
            <seg id="p045">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE himself. He finds that spraying and other necessary work in orchard care may come just when he is the busiest with planting' corn, and again in this age where almost the entire farm operations are done by machinery it is difficult to provide men for spraying at the right time of the year. Some commercial orchard owners receive as high as $50.00 cash rent per acre for apple orchards. The apple exhibit at the Nebraska State Pair showed that the growing of fruit in Nebraska is well worth investigation. The grape crop; was one of the largest for years in 1927. Twenty - two cars of grapes went out of the state and no doubt many more were shipped in 1928. The late freeze did not hurt the grapes and the ' abundant rainfall in July and sunshine made a bumper crop. The nurserymen made a very creditable showing and put the finish - ing touch in the center of the Agricultural Hall with a very attractive exhibit of evergreen trees. The exhibit included about 27 varieties of spruce, pines and Junipers. The exhibit was designed by a competent landscape gardner and was intended to show the beauty that could be given to a yard by proper planting. DOMESTIC PRODUCTS The Domestic Products exhibit continues to draw a great deal of attention. The show in this department is a credit to the ladies of Nebraska. There were 1,285 entries of all kinds of fruit, vegetables, bread and cake. This is a wonderfully large exhibit when it is taken into consideration that all boys' and girls' exhibits are displayed in the club building under a different classification. Four hundred eighty - five dollars and seventy-five cents were offered in this department and 88 per cent of all premiums offered were, paid or the amount of $424.50. BEES AND HONEY EXHIBIT This exhibit was moved down from the balcony of the Agricultural Hall to the ground floor. The people swarmed about the exhibit equal almost to the bees themselves around a hive. With the increasing acreage of sweet clover and alfalfa, bee culture is developing in I the , state as was attested by the increased interest by the men and women who visited the exhibit and asked many intelligent questions about bees. The exhibitors in this department understand their bees and took pride in explaining and giving out the desired information. TEXTILES It is very unfortunate that our cramped condition in the balcony of the Agricultural Hall will not permit arranging this exhibit to the best advantage. Those in charge deserve a lot of credit for the special </seg>
            <seg id="p046">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE effort made and the constructive manner in giving out the desired in - formation to the throngs of people that visit this, exhibit. There were 1,823 entries made, winnings $648.25 in prizes. Despite the advent of machine made quilts, pillow cases and fancy needlework, the thrifty housewives will continue to do fancy work. . ■ . ■ FINE ARTS About three-fourths of the west balcony of the Agricultural Hall is given to the display of Nebraska artists. This space was filled to its capacity with an unusually good exhibit of high class work. The interested people passing, by making favorable comments upon tfre various types of work | on display proves that art is becoming a uni - versal interest and a necessity in our lives. i : ■ An attractive prize for the best article in each lot, the first premium articles competing, encouraged the bringing of the exhibitors' best work. This helped to again raise the standard of work in this depart - ment; 890 entries were made, $759.50 being given in awards. SCHOOL EXHIBIT The growth of our educational exhibit demands much more room than it is possible to allow. It now occupies the south half of the balcony of the Agricultural Hall. It is to be hoped that before another fair rolls around we may have a new educational building. It was necessary this last fair, to rope off a part of the promenade on the balcony for the manual training exhibit. There is no limit to the pro - motion of school . work providing we have a suitable building. Too much can not be said for the educational advantages of this exhibit, it is a fair within itself. SPELLING CONTEST This was the third, year for the State Spelling Contest. There were 30 counties represented... It seems to be increasing in interest. Eleanor Wieden of Aurcrawas winner of both the oral and the written contests. HIGH SCHOOL BAND CONTEST While the High School Band Contest does not develop like we would like, yet we feel it is a worthy i cause. -One reason for not get - ting the number of entries we would like is because a number of schools do not engage a band leader during the vacation season. Pawnee City band won first in its class and the championship. I would like to repeat what was said in the Pawnee City paper, which </seg>
            <seg id="p047">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE is as follows: "Pawnee City never put out a better advertisement than the band it sent to the State Fair last week. It is to be hoped that the; advantage now gained will not be lost and that we will go forward to bigger and better musical achievements. A city picnic in celebra - tion of the band victory will be held at the Fair grounds next Tuesday evening." Such things are worth while. The following were the winners in the contest: Class C — Niobrara first, Osmond second; Class B — Fullerton first, Stromsburg second; Class A — Pawnee City first, Seward second; final — Pawnee City first, Fullerton second. ■ •■ BOYS' AND GIRLS' 4-H CLUBS Club work was a big feature at the Nebraska State Fair. It was more than that, it was a school of inspiration. Just one illustration to show the magnitude of finance involved in an exposition of this kind, the baby beeves were the only exhibits sold and were the only ones upon which we could place an actual value. There were 501 baby beeves exhibited and 472 sold, averaging 925 pounds, dressing 61 per cent and selling for an average of $159.09 per head, above the market - ing cost, for a total of . $75,090.00. This . was the largest baby beef sale ever held in America. The grand champion, fed by Frederick Rottler of Madison county, dressed 67 per cent The reserve cham - pion, owned by Louis Harris of Butler county, dressed 66.1 per cent. Sixty-three counties exhibited 4-H Club work, dividing the prize monies. Lancaster county received the largest share, drawing nearly one thousand dollars in premiums. There were about 1,200 boys and girls that made 6,000 entries in stock, poultry, corn and other agricul - tural products, canning, sewing* and demonstrations of all kinds. We found it very difficult on account of lack, of room to exhibit this junior fair, besides building a row of stalls on the east side of the club building, it was necessary to erect several large tents at a cost to the association of $1,030.00. . . WOMEN'S BUILDING AND BABY CONTEST The Baby Health Contest was as popular as ever. There were 226 babies entered in the contest. We are unable to accommodate one - half of the number wishing to enter in this contest. The rest room for mothers for tiny infants and the emergency hospital were well patronized, in fact the Woman's Building with all its activities is giving real service to the patrons of the Fair. </seg>
            <seg id="p048">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE HEALTH DEMONSTRATIONS j. The demands for information on matters pertaining to health far exceeded expectations.! A corps of four physicians were kept busy daily answering questions on hygiene, sanitation and personal health. The northeast assembly room of the Woman's Building was decorated with posters and charts ; which attracted much attention and called for a physician to be in constant attendance to answer the numerous and various questions. At the other end of the room the Nebraska State Tuberculosis Association was given space where there was displayed an interesting collection of charts and posters. A constant stream of people were weighed and measured. In another corner demonstrations of lip reading were given to those of hard hearing. The desire of this department was to ' popularize health and to create the impression that the periodic health examination could and should be made by the family doctor and that an annual physical check-up is just as im - portant as an annual inventory of your business. This, no doubt, ia a wonderful educational department, but it should be segregated from the better baby department until such time that the Woman's Building can be completed with the two wings as intended when the building was built. RIDES AND DRIVES The Shetland Pony {Ride, Goat Drive and Miniature Railroad all did a big business. They all seemed to be loaded to capacity from morning until night. Those operating these attractions were well pleased. DOG SHOW •"'■•■ The Dog Show is handled by the State Kennel Club. The show is held fcr three days, but /was not quite as large as last year. It was a very interesting exhibit;! many of the individuals were among the best in the country. . CAT SHOW The third Cat Show was held the entire week. There seemed to be quite an interest and was a real cat show. This exhibit seems to be crowded for room. I I CANARY BIRDS Certainly the most restful, homelike place on the grounds was with the canary exhibit. The scores of sensitive songsters that are brought in are naturally timid, knowing neither the place nor the at - tendants. It was with some difficulty that the judges were able to get the contestants to tune in at the right time. </seg>
            <seg id="p049">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE STATE FAIR ON WHEELS Thursday's crowd was centered at the grandstand where the prize winners in . all departments and individual entries with all the other state's activities passed before the throngs of people in the grand - stand. The parade started promptly at one o'clock-jind required one hour to pass. It is getting: larger with each succeeding year' and is one of the real attractions of the Fair. AUTOMOBILE EXHIBIT The automobile show this year was crowded with the latest models of practically all popular makes of cars. Crowds were milling through this building all week and there were many exclamations of admira - tion at the beautiful autos shown. Four-wheel brakes and other up - to-the-minute features were standard equipment on most of the autos exhibited. THE TENTED CITY * The camp ground continues to grow. A very noticeable increase was made this year, the grounds being filled to capacity. Many friends and relatives meet there from different parts of the country for a week's outing together and seemed to be out for a good time. The State Fair is the only place where we have educational features and entertainment for the entire family. Every cottage was engaged months in advance and we should have several more. MACHINERY Manufacturers and distributors of farm implements and machinery of all kinds was on exhibition. No part of the State Fair Grounds attracted more attention than the twenty acres of machinery. It was /interesting to note that a very large percentage of the folks listening to demonstrations were young men from the farms, they are on the alert for something which will enable them to cut production cost and save labor. Wonderful progress has been made in the last few years. It is estimated that the man power of the farm has been increased six hundred per cent in the last .twenty-five years. The American farmer owes much of his efficiency and his ability in reducing produc - tion cost to the farm machinery manufacturers and the latter in return owes much to the progressive attitude of the farmer to invest in worthwhile improvements and make use of them. • STATE INSTITUTIONS Seventeen state institutions were crowded in on the balcony of the north side of the Agricultural Hall, very attractive booths were main - tained and a representative from the respective institutions was pres - (2.) </seg>

BUTTER SCULPTURE At the east end of the Agricultural Hall we had, as usual, the very striking piece of butter sculpture. This year it represented the 4-H Club boys and girls of Nebraska. It was estimated that at least two thousand each hour of the day looked upon this exhibit which required nearly one thousand pounds of butter to make. MANUFACTURERS' BUILDING The Manufacturers' Building ' was well filled with the latest im - proved conveniences for the farm and home. We are badly in need of a new manufacturers' building. This building nets us approximately $4,000.00 per year and could be increased double if we had a- suitable building. WHEAT TRAIN The special wheat train which toured the state during the two weeks preceding the State Fair was on exhibition for Fair visitors. The first car contained exhibits showing the benefit of treating seed wheat to prevent smut, another car included exhibits of the recom - mended varieties of grain for use in Nebraska. UNITED STATES SHIPPING BOARD The United States Shipping Board exhibit was located on the first floor of the Club Building and was a very interesting one. The only expense we are put to in bringing this exhibit. is the space which is furnished free. FISH EXHIBIT Almost every variety of fish were on exhibition. The promenade on the outside of the building was crowded from early morning until night. The Public Address system hooked up to this building gave the patrons an opportunity to listen to lectures on fish culture, their habits and diseases. The Department of Agriculture deserves a great deal of credit for this exhibit, it is not excelled by any other state in the Union. PRESS BUREAU The Press Bureau was. moved into larger quarters and did good work, getting out news stories during the entire Fair. USHERS Eighty Hi-Y boys under the direction of the Young Men's Chris - tian Association did. all of the ushering in the grandstand. Their </seg>
            <seg id="p051">REPORT QF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE handling ' of the immense crowds, afternoon and evening, was very satisfactory. They were housed at the Y. M. C. A. and had their meals at the Hi-Y building, being transported daily to and from the fair grounds. These were carefully selected Hi-Y boys, 15 to 19 years of age, from thirty-one different communities. There was an adult leader for each ten boys with the six Y. M. C. A. secretaries in charge. Service to the State Fair was the motive of the boys coming. At the same time they were given a chance to participate in a program of discussions and addresses, hearing some of the leading men of the state. Every boy was given a thorough physical examination on ar - rival. The State Y. M. C. A. arid the Lincoln Y. M. C. A. co-operated in having charge of the boys. HORSE PULLING CONTEST The pulling contest is increasing in interest, every year. For two years the crowd has filled all the seats prepared for them, and have occupied all the standing room. The state record for light teams was set higher again this year, and with record breaking in sight, there is always a thrill. The two classes were filled. Encouragement could well be given to teams coming in from a considerable distance. This contest is un - questionably a good entertainment for our incoming crowds. THE MIDWAY The Nebraska State Fair has taken the initiative in featuring many improvements in conducting a . Fair, but none that had more favorable comment than when all games were eliminated from the midway. We are getting more money from the concessions and much more satisfaction to the Board of Managers. AUTO GRACING Auto racing three days this year continued to draw good crowds. Seven speedway cars with world known speed drivers provided thrills for the spectators for two hours. If we are going to continue auto racing we should build up the ends of the track to eliminate danger and increase speed. - ' HORSE RACING There were four complete racing programs during the week, both harness and running races, and some very hotly contested races. The Racing Commission is responsible to a great extent in the harness racing, especially in the younger classes, the commission offers special inducements to. draw and school colts. </seg>
            <seg id="p052">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE CHICAGO NORTHWESTERN BAND The Chicago Northwestern Railroad Band, consisting of forty-five uniformed musicians, were present for the third time and rendered concerts Wednesday and Thursday, leading the largest parade ever held on any State Fair grounds. This fine band comes to us without any expense on our part. WAR VETERANS The old soldiers, Spanish-American war veterans and the world war veterans were located on the north side ' of the Agricultural Hall under the balcony. This location was very satisfactory to them and added one more of the state's activities to the Fair. EIGHT-DAY FAIR The eight-day Fair is here' to stay.. It will not be possible to dis - pose of the business of the Nebraska State Fair in six days. The estimated cost of the two extra days was $10,360.00. Our receipts for those two days was approximately $18,147.00. The two extra days gives all the activities on the grounds an opportunity to get organized before the rush on Labor Day. ELECTRIC SERVICE I ■ : Our electric department was 100 per cent. It was necessary, or at least we thought it was, to purchase five new transformers on ac - count of the circus, at a cost of $2,000.00. We now have a very well equipped lighting system. WELL BEHAVED There were only three arrests during the Fair. This is a splendid tribute to Nebraska's citizenship when 427,134 persons were congre - gated on about 100 ucres of land in eight days and only three arrests for drunkenness. If our great state is to succeed we must insure the progress of its only outstanding industry, Agriculture. The well fed and prosper - ous nation rules the world, and a neglect of agriculture leads to col - lapse. A barren, uncultivated country produces a people unconcerned in progressive ideas and j is soon populated with an undesirable citizen - ship. After all is said and done, it is the people that count and the per - manent success of the Nebraska State Fair can be attributed to the class of people that the management is catering to rather than any other one thing. The one radical decision made by our Board is </seg>
            <seg id="p053">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE having great influence on other large Fairs and has been instrumental in building up our young people's activities, was when our Board said to the carnival company and broadcasted it to the world, that not a game of any description would be allowed to operate on the Nebraska State Fair Grounds. We received more money from our concessions and have established confidence with our people and since then many fairs have adopted this same plan. Fairs, both state and county, that allow gambling devices to operate at their fair are doing so at a financial loss. Since the State Fair eliminated all games, the number of concessions have increased and we can charge more and collect all. We get a much better class handling our concessions. The best asset any business man can have is satisfied customers and the confidence cf his patrons.. This will apply to fairs as well. The patrons of the Fair have a right to expect that when they pay their admission into the grounds that they won't be robbed by some faker working under a license issued by the fair board. We like to boast of our educational features of the fair; we like to talk about our interest in the young people and their club work; we get out big bill posters depicting our wonderful exhibition of stock, our night show and musical program; but in all my experience in fair work I have never noticed any fair, through the press or pictured on bill boards, stress the fact that all. kinds of gambling and shows of disiepute will be a part of the program. If- we are going to allow them to operate upon our fair grounds then it would be better to ad - vertise it so our patrons would know what to . expect. There should be no place for an immoral show or any gambling device anywhere at any time, much less at the fair which is our school of object teaching. The standard of our citizenship depends upon our obedience to law' and such things are not only illegal, but immoral and the time is here when we must exclude all objectionable shows and violations of law from our fair grounds. It isn't a proper function of state or county government to foster an organization that has for its primary purpose that of lowering the standard of citizenship. Fairs of this country are entitled to much credit in the way of improving our crops and live stock and are responsible to a great extent for the improvement of farm machinery and have made it pos - sibe for me to say that the man power has increased six hundred per cent and they have a great responsibility in the improvement of our people as well. RECOMMENDATIONS I would recommend to the incoming Board the following: That we extend each end of the race track at leapt five feet. It would </seg>

That we raise the price of admission to the grandstand in the afternoon, all fifty cent seats be raised to seventy-five cents. We have two complete programs in the afternoon of racing and circus. We are giving more than we can afford. Our grandstand receipts should be much more. And again, I will also recommend that we endeavor in some way to enlarge the grandstand. Our grandstand receipts were reduced quite materially by not being able to take care of the immense crowds. I am safe in saying we lost one-half. There were many disappointed people, after coming many miles expecting to see the program in the afternoon to find the grandstand sold out. I would arrange with the Department of Agriculture to attend to the sanitation. I' feel sure this can be done without cost to us. : I I want to close thanking all that had a part in the 1928 Nebraska State Fair, the fine co-Joperation received at every hand is bound to succeed. Organization and co-operation are the two words that mean so much in the progress I of any fair, they go hand in hand, one can mot succeed without the other. It matters not what your organization may be, unless you can have the co-operation to the fullest extent, not only from those on the inside, but those on the outside as well, your fair can not function as it should. We have the organization and am pleased to say that we appreciate the co-operation received from all.

            <seg id="p064">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE •■ i |. .- ■ : • ,.;•.-.■■ THE ANNUAL BANQUET of the NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE and the NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF COUNTY FAIR MANAGERS Hotel Cornhusker, January 15, 1929 Adrian Newens acted as toastmaster and the following comprised the toast list: Mrs. Esther Myers, Frank Tom son, Irl D. Tolen and Governor' A. J. Weaver. Following the foregoing speakers, who had expounded wit and humor and indulged in keen "roasting" and "toasting" in an entertain - ing manner, the concluding address, given in a serious vein to set forth a practical serious message, was given by Governor Arthur J. Weaver. GOVERNOR ARTHUR J. WEAVER: Mr. Toastmaster, members of the State Board of Agriculture and county fair organizations of this state, and your guests, including members of the legislature: I deem it a privilege to • be here tonight. I am afraid, however, after this extensive and 1 splendid program that in having me appear on this program at this late hour, they are taking a chance of bringing on an anti-climax. I have been referred to here as having been in the apple business, and I have so been for a great many years. Up until this time I have been almost convinced that the exclusive apple country was in southeastern Nebraska, , but after having sat at this table for two and a half hours tonight it seems-to me they have produced more apple-sauce than I thought there was in the whole world. I know now that Nebraska is a state of varied resources. I want to congratulate your fair managements on this program, and on the assembling of this splendid audience. About two years ago my young daughter, now six, came rushing into the toom where I was, displaying some nice new stockings and said, "Daddy, aren't they swell stockings." I. replied, "Josephine, they are not swell stockings, but they are nice brown stock - ings." Then she said in a tone that did not leave a great deal unex - pressed, "You could callltheni keen, couldn't you." So when I think of the advances in this great age in which we live, when I see the progress that George Jackson has made since he first came on this board, and since I, first knew him, as I said the other night out at the State Farm, from his struggling youth to a struggling old age would come to realize that we are -living in a progressive age. I suppose that most of you know that this great ballroom and this </seg>
            <seg id="p065">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE splendid addition to this great hotel was primarily a child in the mind of George Jackson. That futuristic picture on the stage there was particularly painted in honor of him. And in view of the way this organization is growing it seems to me maybe I should have exercised a little longer guardianship on this board instead of wanting to become governor of Nebraska so soon. . Now turning from the field of wit and humor, I want to make a. few more serious observations about some of the things that have brought us together tonight. I cannot help but become reminiscent tonight as to my connection with this board. I went on this board about eight years ago. The first intimation I had of being elected a member was when I saw it in the state papers. I had such fine associa - tions with Mr. Jackson and others in this organization and I have taken it as a great honor to be elected a member of this State Board of Agri - culture, which has been such a great factor in building Nebraska. Going back to the beginning of this state, one of its first presidents was J. Sterling Morton, the author of Arbor Day, the man who con - ceived a great idea, which has spread until it has gone around the world, plant trees. Followed not only in this state which originally was a prairie state, but adopted in every country under the sun be - cause wherever there are people, those people believe in the finer things of life, and gain an inspiration from the trees, from the fruit and from the flowers. Another governor of this state, going back a little further into the history of this board, was one of its earlier officers, Robert Furnas, one of the great leaders in this movement. There are so many men I could name tonight who have been outstanding characters in Nebraska, who have been active in this work. Not that they have needed to be gov - ernors, or senators, to be such great leaders because the great thing in Nebraska with all of its agricultural interests has been to build up its citizenship. So with institutions like this, it is always building for the future, leaving a legacy from those who pass on that stands as a monument to the performance of a real public service. I take pride not only in the fact that I have .been a member of this board for eight years but also in the fact that when I was a member of the legislature of this state I introduced the bill permanently locat - ing the State Fair in Lincoln thirty years ago. I take further pride in the fact that this institution has been so pre-eminently successful. Talking about the cost of government in this state, it may interest you to know that since this Fair was permanently established at Lincoln the state of Nebraska has voted for its support for lands, and buildings, and for all those purposes about $800,000. There has been paid back to the people of this state over $100,000 — more than that, to the pro- </seg>
            <seg id="p066">REPORT QF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ducers of livestock, grain, and all of the things which go to make Nebraska such a great state. In addition to this the state. of Nebraska, as a part of her capital assets, as a part of her accumulations, as a state, has lands and buildings of a physical valuation of around $1,250,000. How did that come about? It came about because of the careful man - agement of men like those who sit before me tonight. It' came about because of the co-operation of the splendid men connected with the county fairs throughout this state. It came about because of the active participation of such fine women of Nebraska as Mrs. Myers who has spoken to us tonight. I remember when Frank O. Lowden, one of the fine men of. Amer - ica, spoke at Des Moines a few years ago saying that' during periods of distress or depression, which always follow great wars, it was to be expected that the greatest war in history would produce a violent unrest, a revival of "Reds" over the nation, race-riots, that it would again prove true "that the saving elements of this nation, as it had been from the beginning would be those raised in the farm homes of America. Men, that is true, that men who are interested in the soil, men who are interested in those things so close to nature, as they have all through history, would build great stabilizing forces. After all, above the strength of armies and the majesty of navies, has stood the character of peoples, and upon the character of the homes has been built the glory of the state. Because we are building spiritually and building intellectually we must build it through institutions like this to form a basis of a greater brotherhood. ■ I am sincerely glad to be here tonight as a member of this State Board of Agriculture. One -of my great regrets will be to have missed becoming president of this board. A little while back my friend, T. H. Wake, wanted to step aside to let me advance ahead of my time. I said, "Tom Wake, if you do that, I will resign from this organization, for that is contrary to the principles and the custom of this organiza - tion." The men who have succeeded here have worked their way up. That has been one of the elements of strength of this body: There is no partisanship in this board, and there should be none. The business of this state is bigger and broader than politics. As a result of all of this, Nebraska has built a great exposition, one of the greatest in America, just as she has built that great capitol, which is being built on that policy of "paying as you go". That is a sound policy which is being used in public affairs in Nebraska because when you "pay as you go" you can count the cost and check the re - sults of your expenditures. So we have built this fair. We have built up our livestock and other industries. Yet after all that is a small part of it. We may pile up dollars yet •in the final analysis they are not </seg>
            <seg id="p067">REPORT QF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE entirely worth while. We build these citidals of wealth, yet after all they are finally swept away by the finer things, for we have built in Nebraska a kind of a citizenship that is exemplified here tonight. Just a few years ago I read for the third time that wonderful his - torical story of Ben Hur, written by General Lew Wallace. I was thrilled as I have always been thrilled by the recital of that great chariot race, when at the crucial moment of that race, Messla, the Roman, brought down his lash on those wonderful white steeds and .then they sprang forward, and just then the great strong arm of Ben Hur, driving another chariot, came into play, to pass by and win the race. Through that great crowd there was one question in mind, where had this unknown Jew attained this mastery of mind and limb which gave him this victory? The answer is, that it was through those long years of service as a galley-slave, where so long he had fought the sea. So this crowning success of this great exposition in Nebraska is due to the efforts put forth through years and struggle by the men and women of Nebraska. It represents not what has been done in one year but what we have done in more than a generation. When we count the wealth of Nebraska we see as far as the natural wealth is con - cerned we have increased our assessed wealth from around $500,000,000 to more than $3,000,000,000. All of this we have done in a generation, yet we find that the wealth Nebraska has really produced is repre - sented by such institutions as our State University, our Agricultural College, our common school system of the state, and our state and county fairs. Now, in conclusion' I simply want to say this, my association and my work with this board has been one of real inspiration as well as one of the greatest pleasures of my life. Yet we have all kinds of men who make up this board. They are all good men and they may have differences temporarily, but they soon iron them out. There was a story that came to- me recently of a gentleman of the old school who was bemoaning the fact that there no longer exists what was once known as that famous drink, the American cocktail. He said that to make that good you put in a little sugar to make it sweet, and you put in a little lemon to make it sour, and then you put in a little ice to make it cold and a little whisky to make it hot. So it is with the various characters of men with whom I have served on this board. We will put on men like Tom Wake, Perry Reed and others I could name to make it cold, matter of fact men; we want men like Emerson Purcell, or good old George Jackson and others to make it sweet; we could put in several men to make it hot, and - particularly we would put in good old Charlie Graff to make it hot, and we would put nothing in to make it sour, for we are all optomists and we all believe in the </seg>

I remember recently reading an old colored minister's definition of a pessimist. When asked by one who had listened to his sermon and told him that he liked it except he used several times a word that he didn't understand and that was the word and wanted to know, what it meant. The ofd parson says, that comes from the Latin word "persimmon" which means "to pucker". I If any young man in this state wants to get into the work of real service, a work to which Ed. Danielson devoted some of the best years of his life, a work in which George Jackson came into fruition in this state until he became in my opinion the greatest showman since Bar - num's day, just get into this organization of county and state fair work. There you will find this fellowship, find an inspiration for real service and in the end you will learn the truth of the statement that if you will live in deeds, in thoughts and not in feelings, you must live in service. I thank you. FORENOON SESSION January 1 6th, 1 929 Cornhusker Hotel, Lincoln, Nebraska By PRESIDENT WAKE: First, I am going to call upon Mr. Henry Sunderman for a few remarks. By MR. SUNDERMAN (New president of County Fair Managers' Association): I wish all of those present were in the room for the few remarks I have to make. These pertain to all of them. As I said yesterday I desire that if you have any questions you want brought up at the next convention you will send them in either to the secretary or myself. You will fully realize that is a very important thing for us to have on our program these local questions like we had yesterday and the day before. One such question was sent to the Grievance Committee; pertain - ing to where the county commissioners do not give them the money they should have; those things ought to be ironed out. Possibly this matter will be ironed out before long. Another question that came up, and I would like to have brought up before the house but didn't, was how far we should reach out in paying premiums, that is, whether they </seg>
            <seg id="p069">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE should be open to the world, or limited to the immediately surround - ing territory, or to the county itself? All such things are of vital importance to any of you. Then there are two other important things to bring up. We would like to attain 100 per cent clear on the list and register. I found last night there Were just ten counties who had not paid their dues for 1929. I under - stand one or two of those came in this morning. I know that is just through some neglect or mistake those are not yet paid. You know we would like to have that so as to make a clear record. Another thing, we will try and have the report of our annual meeting out in.th; course of this summer, if not sooner, so that you will have it for your consideration. That is about all I have to say at this time, Mr. Presi - dent. By SECRETARY JACKSON: Don't you think you ought to get that report out right away, say, inside of sixty days? ■ By MR. SUNDERMAN: The other day when I got the report, my wife said, "Did you just get that?" and I said, "Yes." She asked, "Why don't they get it out sooner?" I answered, "That is what I i thought." Then on second thought I looked back to the previous meet - ing, when' this brought it to my attention, and as I looked over the I report it refreshed my recollection as to that meeting and brought me to this one with those things in mind. There are two sides to the i question. I expect it would be all right for it to be out right away. We should all be interested in this; then if we want our memories jogged, we can go and hunt it up and go over it just before we come .to the meeting. By PRESIDENT WAKE: I believe we have a gentleman here today who can bring up another interesting matter. I will introduce the gentleman from Dawes County. REPRESENTATIVE E. P. WILSON: Mr. Chairman, and gentle - i men: Our fairs are primarily educational institutions and their educa - tional value is becoming recognized more and more every year. Now since these facts are true we must endeavor to make them of greater interest constantly to the boys and girls. Now, I have talked to the i superintendent of public instruction, who has indicated that he will make a ruling to the effect that under reasonable conditions attendance credit for school will be given to boys and girls for attendance at fairs; that is to say, that if a boy or girl in the county will attend the county fair and comply with the rules that the superintendent might ' specif y, they should be given credit for school attendance the day they are </seg>
            <seg id="p070">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE attending. I think that will apply likewise with the State Fair where several days attendance is put in there. Now, a group of county superintendents in the northwest part of the state are at work on this problem, of what recognition should be made to these boys and girls- for fair attendance, and how they may be given credit for school attendance. It has seemed to that group of superintendents that it will be necessary to have the boys and girls on the day or days they attend the county fair given considerable special attention. For instance, they must be shown through the livestock exhibits by parties who are cap - able of explaining to them what there is of interest and instruction there, and so on through the various other exhibits. They must ob - serve while on the fair grounds, for I think it would be understood that these boys and girls after they return to their school would be required to write stories of what they saw at the county fair. I think before they go to the fair they will be given some special instructions or explanations as to what they ought to look for and just how they ought to proceed in order to make the most out of the fair. Now through the kindness of the officers of this Association I have been given permission to present this matter .to you this morning. I think this can be launched and that sometime before the fair season commences, that various fair officers will be given the suggestions that the state superintendent may have with regard to this matter, which suggestions I am sure will be in harmony with what this committee is already doing. I know that the fair officers of Nebraska will give it their most hearty co-operation, because of the educational value every l'air has to the boys and girls of the county and the state. By SECRETARY JACKSON: I am mighty glad that Representa - tive Wilson brought this question up. I have been interested in this line of education which our fairs have been striving toward for several years. I have talked it over with the state superintendent of public instruction on different occasions. He feels also that the time is right here when, especially from the state fair viewpoint, we can inject into our state fair, and also into our county fairs, a greater emphasis upon the educational feature. I am satisfied that the boys and girls of the seventh and eighth grades and on up can get much more out of a week's education at the state fair, or a similar or even shorter period at the county fairs, than they can in school. We have talked it over several times, Mr. Wilson and myself, with the state superintendent of schools of having the state fair outline an educational program for our boys and girls, and I had this in mind, if it could be done, for instance, there may be counties, up to 25 per cent, that do not start their schools. </seg>
            <seg id="p071">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE until after the county fair, and especially until after the stat"e fair; or with the remainder, if school has started the boys and girls could be given credit for attendance at the state fair. As. Mr. Wilson says, that educational program could be worked out, for instance, tents could be erected on the fair grounds, or possibly a part of some building chosen and assigned where they could meet at say nine o'clock and go from there to follow the day's program. We would have a man there quali - fied to speak on these subjects and to take the boys and girls into the classes they would prefer to work in. It might be they were inter - ested in stock, in which case they could go, if they cared to do so, to where they were judging cattle, sheep, or hogs and ask the judges any questions they wanted to; they could be shown how to select milk cows; could be shown how to cull poultry; how to select seed corn. All of these are practical things, and they are necessary to run a successful farm. This line of education with such men as Mr. Wilson in charge, I am sure could be worked out so that the boys and girls of Nebraska would get 100 per cent more in practical education at the state fair in a week's attendance or in a few days at a county fair than they could possibly get in the same time attending any school. I think this is a thing you men ought to think about, and bring it up with your county superintendent of schools and work it out. There is another thing, Mr. Wilson;- I don't believe they under - stand about this county appropriation bill that you happen to be inter - ested in. Would you explain that. By MR. E. P. WILSON: Under the law passed by the 1927 ses - t ion of the legislature, a measure that Mr. Jackson had a great deal to do with, it is provided that the rural schools of the county shall receive from the county board an appropriation that is reasonably ample for financing the rural school exhibit at the county fair. This pro - vision is, as I remember, that a certain percentage of the rural teachers of the county must make a formal request of the county superintendent for this money and when that is done it is then mandatory upon the county board to set aside this sum of money. I believe it would' be a very fine thing for you to get in touch with your county fair officers and with the county superintendent about this and encourage the superintendent to do this. Of course, the superintendent, as a rule, is very glad to do that but sometimes some encouragement is needed. This county rural school exhibit as a matter of course has a tendency to bring in a large number of boys and girls that otherwise might not care so much about coming to the fair. It is an educational feature of the very finest and highest value for all who are concerned in this kind of work. </seg>
            <seg id="p072">REPORT QF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE By A DELEGATE: Does this apply to all schools, including both city and rural schools? By MR. E. P. WILSON: Mr. Chairman, I hardly think the law would apply to counties where they have large cities; I remember in drawing it that we had in mind primarily exhibits from the rural schools. I am under the impression that the law would apply only to rurals and small towns. I don't think it would apply to Douglas and Lancaster counties, at least. By DAVID KAUFMAN (Hall County): This law Mr. Wilson has quoted; this is the second time I have gone into this, and the same thought came to me in this series of sessions, thfil is, would it be possible when the next book is published, or pamphlet issued, to tell us about this matter, that is, have the office of the secretary of the association gather all of the laws, active on the statutes, that pertain to county fairs and print them in this next book or pamphlet for the information of all concerned in county fairs. The same thought came to me when I attended the first meeting of this series. It seems to me this would be feasible, and very advisable. By HENRY SUNDERMAN (President County Fair Managers' Association): I don't know which one of those questions to answer first. In our case, our commissioners are in "the clear. They do pay the premiums on our school exhibit, of the school work and we have a splendid collection for an exhibit by the. children of farm products. By MR. E. P. WILSON: This exhibit may be whatever the chil - dren and the school determine to show. By MR. SUNDERMAN: We have had better attendance in our county than we had a few years ago, due to the fact that we are not rubbing elbows between our town and Norfolk. Norfolk is better of late but there was a time a few years ago they would not let the chil - dren go to the county fair. I believe that is a mistake. Now if these children could get credit for the day they attend the fair, in their school attendance, we believe that would help a whole lot in bringing these tioys and girls to the county fair. My idea has always been that if we could do something to encourage the children to come to the county fair we have accomplished a great deal. We have gained a great deal because in many instances, or in most instances, if the chil - dren go to the fair papa and mamma will come too; I believe we can say from our experience that if the children had to go to school, papa and mamma would stay at home. We don't want that. We want papa and mamma to come to the fair and want the children to come too. So if we can bring this about that the children will be given the same credit they would receive if in school, the county fair will be helped a </seg>
            <seg id="p073">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE •'•."■■ great deal. It will be a mighty fine thing. I am sure that the children will be getting as much knowledge at the fair as if they were in school, or I am badly mistaken.- Of course, where the fair is held before school takes up they are now able to come, but not many of the fairs are held before school starts. In some way men could be' provided to guide or instruct these boys and girls, and some means could also be provided to check these boys and girls in and check their attendance when they go on the fair grounds so they can bring that back and show the teacher they really did go to the fair. In our county now the children under fifteen get a pass good for every day. This' little pass is just a recognition or token to 'the boy or girl and comes to them through the superintendent and teachers, extended to show that they are recognized. Such a token or a ticket seems more real to them than it would to give them a quarter in money and bears a greater significance. By MR. E. J. MITCHELL of Deshler: I was in the office of the state superintendent of public instruction Monday and he told me that he would like very much to be present at some of our meetings, but he has been called away and he asked me to state, if this matter came up, in regard to credit for school attendance based on fair attendance that he was heartily in favor of it, and if there could be some method adopted of having a proper record of the child's attendance at the fair, from when they left home and would check out there, and check in at the fair, and that could be turned over to the proper authorities who should have taken it in charge and authorities who would see that they went through the fair and took in the educational program that might be arranged. He said he was very much interested in that and was very sorry he might not be able to come and be here with us. By PRESIDENT WAKE: I think, gentlemen, this proposition is worth going into just as deeply as you can. In a great many cases in your local counties you fair men can see to it that the schools are not opened until after the state fair is held if you would just bring a little pressure to bear on the proper authorities. I know that has happened in our town and can be done in a great many other towns. We can thus give these boys and girls a chance to attend the state fair as well as the county fairs. I am very glad, indeed, that this matter came up, and I think eventually the fair men can go into it deeper and get it lined up as it should be. I believe we had better move along with the meeting so we can get through in time. By PRESIDENT WAKE: We will now hear the supplemental report of the Credentials Committee. (3) </seg>
            <seg id="p074">REPORT QF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE By CHAIRMAN VON SEGGREN: The supplemental report of the Credentials Committee shows that Mr. L. E.

By CHAIRMAN LAMB: The report of the Revision Committee is now ready. Mr. Grau didn't get in until late yesterday. He has a very ; few changes to offer in Class F, the Farm Products or Agricultural Department, but I will ask' him to give you what he has in mind there and then I will go on with the remainder of this report. By MR. GRAU: I have but a few recommendations of changes to be made, for the reason that a year ago we went into this matter very thoroughly and made numerous recommendations which were adopted last year. ■ As far as Class F is concerned it is now fairly satisfactory to the great majority of exhibitors of the state, but you will find on page 105, No. 1707, add to words- "Collection of" "Native Grasses" by a County; on page 107, strike out on No. 1744, premium on Mammoth Chili Squash; on page 110, Lot 9, (Corn, Growth of 1928, Eastern) Add the follow - ing rule: "Corn exhibits selected from late varieties and entered either as medium or ninety days will be ruled out." Some exhibitors . are small enough to pick out certain corn nine inches or over out of a lot of corn and go out to enter it, so we feel we must put in a rule that will enable the judges to have authority to rule that bunch out, so an exhibitor can't try to cop all of the premiums. On page 117, Lot 15, Rule 3, is re-written as follows: "All exhibits competing for individual premiums must have been grown in the county - exhibiting and be the growth of the current year." . ■ \ </seg>
            <seg id="p075">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ■ . I So instead of making a change in the figures each year, as chang - ing "1928" to read "1929" or so forth, we just use the words "current year". "Exhibits of previous year's growth may be used in making a collective exhibit in this class." (See rule at heading of Class "F".) That constitutes all of the changes we have to offer. I move the adoption of these recommendations when the proper time comes to act upon the entire Revision Committee report. By PRESIDENT WAKE: Are there any suggestions anyone wishes to make regarding that particular class in the premium list, or changes you wish to tender? If there are none, we will ask Mr. Lamb to con - tinue with the remainder of the report. REPORT OF THE PREMIUM REVISION COMMITTEE By Chairman Lamb Lincoln, Nebr., Jan. 15, 1929.

By CHARLES GRAFF, Bancroft: Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen of the Convention: We have come again and reached the stage once more in our pro - ceedings when it' has become our duty to elect officers who are to have charge of this great organization of the State Board of Agriculture for the coming year. We have had very interesting meetings here this week. I think they are by far the most interesting meetings of our county fair people, and also of the State Board of Agriculture, I have seen. The county fair people 'found a committee on resolutions, and so did the state fair people find a committee on resolutions, both of which reported they had nothing to resolute. It seems to me that looks well for our organization, who are conducting affairs so that no serious situations face either organization that need such action. Now, this morning we are to elect officers who will be our heads for the coming year, to guide the destiny of our work and the re - sponsibility will be in their hands. I am glad to say to you we have quite a number who are peculiarly well fitted for these positions. These are men who are available, but now may I say that the man whom I am about to place in nomination is one who began many years ago down in the Swine Barn, and who has graduated up through all stages of our work until he' is at the present time vice-president of this great body, and he is worth, yes, he is qualified, able and fearless and is a good, square-shooter, a real, old farmer, a live stock man, and one who understands the work that is going to come to him if you elect him as your president of this State Board of Agriculture.

I remember ten, twelve or fourteen years ago when I was first elected on his board, I was not present at the meeting. I was in my own home town and the next morning a man informed me that I had been elected to some office down in Lincoln. I knew nothing about it until that next day. But the next year I was put at the head of the swine department. I had charge as superintendent of swine for a few years. Then they passed me around from place to place until now I am certainly pleased to have this honor bestowed upon me at this time. By PRESIDENT WAKE: We now come to the order of business where we will receive nominations for second vice-president. By SENATOR W. B. BANNING, Union: I would like to place in nomination for second vice-president a man who has always been greatly . interested in the forwarding of agriculture in the state of Nebraska; he has always taken an active part, and has in the past two years been in demand and has always responded to every call. He is a man we can trust at all times, in that position, to forward the best interests of all in the state of Nebraska and to advance the Nebraska State Fair, so I wish to place in nomination at this time, Irl D. Tolen for second vice-president. Nomination seconded. By PRESIDENT WAKE: Are there any other nominations? By SENATOR A. H. MILLER, Washington County: I move you that the rules be suspended and the secretary be instructed to cast the unanimous ballot of this meeting for Irl D. Tolen for second vice - president. Motion seconded. Vote taken. By THE PRESIDENT: Motion carried. By SECRETARY JACKSON: It affords me much pleasure at this time to cast the entire ballot of 90 votes for Irl D. Tolen for second vice-president. ■ . ■■-.;! By PRESIDENT WAKE: Our next order of business will be to receive nominations for treasurer for the ensuing year. </seg>
            <seg id="p083">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE By PERRY REED: I wish to place in nomination the name of Thomas H. Wake for treasurer. Motion seconded. Vote taken. Motion seconded. By VICE-PRESIDENT LAMB, taking chair: Are there any further nominations for treasurer? BY CHARLES GRAFF: I move you that the nomination be now closed and the secretary be instructed to cast the unanimous ballot for Thomas H. Wake for treasurer. Motion carried. Vote taken. Motion declared carried. By MR. LAMB: We will hear from Mr. Wake. By PRESIDENT (Treasurer-elect) WAKE: I thank you, gentle - men, for this honor. I don't want you to expect me to fill these duties as well as Bill Banning has done. Now I believe we overlooked a bet in not yet hearing from our new second vice-presidents By IRL D. TOLEN: Gentlemen of the convention: It goes .without saying that I am delighted with the honor that has been given to me at your hands this morning. It comes just a little earlier time than 'it would have had it not been for the retire - ment of Mr. Weaver to other honors, he having been in line for presi - dent this year. Being one of the younger members of the board I am quite pleased, of course, that I would get in line for head of this or - ganization as soon as I have. I have enjoyed fair work for the past twenty years, from the agri - cultural department of our county fair up to the work on the State Fair Board. There is something about it that has always appealed to me. I think the greatest appeal that comes to me in fair work is connected with the Boys and Girls- Club work. I have always had an intense interest in that, and I hope I never wane on that phase of the work. I have enjoyed the association of the county fair fellows and have been intensely interested in working with the members of the State Board of Agriculture. I hope the time will never come when we will lose the interest of such splendid men as we now have in fair work and I sincerely hope also that there will always be the calibre of men such as are sitting in this room this morning to foster and promote agri - culture in Nebraska. By PRESIDENT WAKE: The next order of business will be to reive nominations for the election of a secretary. , By E. K. PURCELL, of Broken Bow: The success of the Nebraska State Fair, gentlemen, has largely been due to the fact that we have had our veterans promoted and advanced in fair work, and one of our </seg>
            <seg id="p084">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE veterans had been promoted and retained in the management of the fair work. It brings considerable satisfaction to me to know from my experience in serving with him, and in having served with so many others who have worked on this Board. When I went on the Board in 1912, one of the two veterans who still serves this Board who was there at the beginning of my administration was the present secre - tary of our Fair. I have worked with him in various capacities. I served with him as a superintendent; later on the Board of Managers. I saw his work, I saw his efficiency increase; I saw him grow in fair work until now. I believe and I feel confident that the State Fair of Nebraska has a secretary who is probably one of the leading ones of the United States, and in saying this we have only to point to the wonderful success that the Nebraska State Fair has attained. I could go on talking for a long time about the good qualities of George Jack - son. I know him. We all know him, as one of the biggest secretaries in the United States but I am going to stop and place him in nomina - tion for secretary for the ensuing year. Nomination .seconded, from floor. By MR. H. J. McLAUGHLIN : It gives me great pleasure to rise and especially second the nomination of Mr. Jackson, I know him very intimately; I know his ability; I know what he has accomplished for the State Fair. I worked with him in state fair matters for eleven years. Yes, it gives me great pleasure to second this nomination. By A. H. MILLER: I move that the rules be suspended and the president be instructed to cast the entire ballot for George Jackson for secretary. Motion seconded. Question put to vote. By PRESIDENT: Motion carried. I now take this pleasure, men, of casting 90 votes for George Jackson for secretary for the ensuing year. . | Now before I turn over my gavel to my successor I want again to thank you — everyone of you — for the hearty support and co-opera - tion you have given me. Now we will hear from Mr. Jackson. •• By SECRETARY JACKSON: Mr. President and co-workers of the fair game, I sure appreciate the continued confidence placed in me and the only thing I regret is that my wife is not here to hear these nice things Purcell said about, me. I have lived in this state for forty - three years; not as long as some of you have been in the state, but I have seen it develop a great deal in those forty-three years, not only among our agricultural interests but the county fairs and state fair as well. We like to boast of our agriculture. We like to tell you all </seg>
            <seg id="p085">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE about our improved livestock and all of that, but that is not our great - est responsibility that the fairs of Nebraska have at this time. I think it I was Roosevelt who said that if you want to do something worth while for a man or a woman that you have got to start when they are boys and girls. We have always taken a great interest in two classes of people; one, the pioneers of this country some of whose pic - tures are hanging on the walls in our office, and the young people. We honor the pioneers for what they did and we love to work with the boys and girls for what they may . do in the future. That is one of the great responsibilities of this association, not only to raise good stock, but' to develope good citizenship. After all is said and done it is the people who count. If I was going to take up my residence in your little town around over the state, if I was going to establish a home there, the first thing I would probably do is to go out and look your city over. Your real estate men would take me out and show me all over the city, they would tell me about your hotels and show me your finest residences; they would boast of your fine homes and lawns. They would tell me about your schools and churches. Your banks might be bursting with gold, but what I would want to know before I estab - lished a home there would be as to what kind of people lived there. If you could prove that you had the right kind of citizens I could tell you whether you have homes or whether you have just had houses. I could tell you whether you had Christians or just had church mem - bers. So after all is said and done the greatest responsibility we have is with the boys and girls of Nebraska. So long as I am secretary of your organization my outstanding work is going to be to develop citi - zens. If I am on the wrong trail then you had better get somebody else. You can't develop citizenship or interest the young people in the right way if you are going to invite our young people to come here &lt;ind then admit them to a place where you open every gambling device imaginable. I maybe a crank on this but you don't want your people to . leave your fair grounds with the thought that they have been skinned by some faker who was licensed by the fair association itself. We are having no trouble with that here. Our Board don't allow any sort of a gambling game on the Nebraska State Fair Grounds. I heard one of the men say to me that if we don't clean up our County Fairs that we will lose our appropriations. That is the thing I have just wanted to bring up. They will not stand for it in the legislature. We must take into consideration all of these young people. This may not be a situation that applies to very many of our fairs. We like to boast that we are doing our best and that we are putting qn fine dis - plays, we like to tell about our club work and our fine musical pro - grams but we must live up to all of this. We are glad to say that </seg>
            <seg id="p086">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ■...■• there is not a gambling device allowed on our State Fair grounds. I have not mentioned this as words of criticism but I do want to see the County Fairs of Nebraska made the best that we can possibly make them. By PRESIDENT WAKE: Now, men, again I want to thank you for a consideration and the co-operation you have given me for the last two years. I am going to turn the chair over to your newly - elected president, Mr. Lamb. MR. A. W. LAMB: At this time it becomes my duty to appoint four men as members of the Board of Managers. I will appoint A. H. Miller, Washington county; R. R. Vance, Adams county; W. B. Ban - ning, Cass county; W. T. Parkinson, Pawnee county. CHARLES GRAU: I' move you that the men whose names were just read by the newly elected president be approved by this body as members of the Board of Managers. Seconded. PRESIDENT LAMB: It has been moved and seconded that the four men just appointed be approved as members of the Board of Managers. All in favor say "Aye", opposed "No". ■ Motion carried.

For twenty-eight successive years your State Fair has been held on its present site. During this period of time the legislature of Nebraska has appropriated $780,000 for the purchase of the grounds, erection of buildings and minor improvements. During this same period of time this organization has staged the twenty-eight fairs, paid out for premiums during this time the sum of $895,132.91, and have put back into the grounds in the way of per - manent improvements and upkeep a total of $850,231. You will note that from our receipts during this twenty-eight year period we have paid out $115,132 more for premiums than the total state appropriation for grounds and buildings. The Nebraska State Fair is conceded by all to be the greatest advertising medium in Nebraska. We are proud of its record. It not only advertises our resources, but finds buyers for our products. During the twenty-eight years' residence in Lincoln it has developed to such extent that the institution is valued at one million and a quarter dollars. W </seg>

Members of the Association and Friends: The time of year suggests the appropriateness of taking our bear - ings. Perhaps it would not be out of place- if I came before you as your president and again summarized for you the work of our Society for the calendar year last past. . I am very glad to welcome you to our annual meeting, and I am pleased to see so many, of you out so early this morning. For those • ' who are new at our gatherings I wish to ex- plain that these reports of your officers are made largely for the sake of record. They are I W reproduced in the annual report of the Asso - |V. ciation, and serve the double purpose of keep - | - ■ : ;"" _^ . ing the officers alive and on their toes, while I .at the same time helping to inform our absent ; '"* membership and future officers of the work \ "^7~~ : that has been carried on during the year. \ -.

Nevertheless, .. . ,„ „ there was such a dearth of information regard- Wayland W. Magee ... .. ... , ., - - , » ing the activities of the Crop Growers Asso - ciation on file, even in their annual reports, at the time I took office, I feel, if for no other reason than to help the men who will come after me, I should summarize our activities at this time. Our Purpose as an Organization As I see it, the reason for our existence as a society was well set out in the subjects as expressed in our constitution under Article 2, which reads as follows: "The object of this Association shall be to advance the interests of agriculture in Nebraska by increasing the yields of corn and farm crops through improve - ment in the seed, improvement in methods of tillage and seeding, conservation of soil fertility and soil moisture, and by discussion of social and economic questions relating to agriculture." Our society is at this time beyond question one of the active con - necting links or points of contact between the College of Agriculture, </seg>
            <seg id="p112">REPORT QF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE which includes the Experiment Station, and the farmers themselves who are out on the land. It has been our privilege to bring to the attention of many of our neighbor farmers the results of the research and experimental work which has been carried on here at the College. In this part of -our program we have through the year just past in no way deviated from the long time custom except as we have added new features to the work. Some of Our Activities The nineteenth annual report for the year ending January 3d, 1928,' has been compiled and edited by our secretary-treasurer, and by him transmitted to his excellency, the governor, and copies mailed to our membership. This I understand is required by statute. Our membership has continued to grow until now we have some 600 names on our roster. These men are for the most part active, actual farmers, though we have some names on our mailing list of men who are not engaged in farming themselves, yet they are closely allied to the agricultural industry of. the state. . . As heretofore the most useful work of the society, as I see it, has been our seed certification work. During the past year we have, as a society, certified in all 172,305 bushels of field seeds in quantities from 10 to 10,000 bushels, this total being made up of the following: Nebraska 60 Winter Wheat 101,230 Bushels Kanred Winter Wheat 15,690 Bushels Burt 293 Oats 4,860 Bushels Nebraska 21 Oats. 12,310 Bushels Comfort Barley 8,025 Bushels Velvet Barley 2,590 Bushels Trebi Barley 13,860 Bushels Minnesota 184 Barley. 7,000 Bushels Turkey Red Winter Wheat. 1,750 Bushels Marquis Spring Wheat 2,900 Bushels Rosen Rye 1,700 Bushels Kanota Oats 400 Bushels We have no way of finding out how much of this was used for seed, but we have records of sales showing that many bushels were sold for seed, and in all probability most of it was used for seed pur - poses. . . ' Certified Seed Spreads Varieties The point that will be remembered by most of you who are not hounds for statistics, however, will be the fact that it is conservatively estimated that now, ten years after its introduction, approximately one- </seg>
            <seg id="p113">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION half of the winter wheat area of Nebraska is annually seeded to the improved strain of Turkey Red Wheat, known as Nebraska 60, and that by this fact we have added to the income of the wheat growers of Nebraska approximately $3,000,000 annually, with no appreciable in - crease of expense. The Nebraska Crop Growers' Association acts as a connecting link between the Nebraska Experiment Station and the individual farmer. While these facts are of interest, the one which interests your officers most is the fact that the society has now become self-support - ing through the self-imposed tax on seed sales. Nor have we been satisfied at this time with continuing the work of certifying small grain alone, but have branched out and during the last year, for the first time, have certified alfalfa for the growers in western Nebraska. Preliminary work has also been done in inspecting and certifying corn for out of state shipment as seed stock. One of our new projects, undertaken for the first time during Ihe last year, has been the gathering of so-called "small grain specials" at the Nebraska State Fain, the object being to accumulate, for advertis - ing purposes, some of the better samples of Nebraska grown small grains. For financial aid in starting and making possible this work, credit and our thanks should be given to the OYnaha Grain Exchange who have generously furnished the funds necessary for the prizes and advertising. (4a) . </seg>
            <seg id="p114">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The Nebraska Experiment Station distributed Comfort barley to farmers for the first time in the spring of 1928. Note the distribution of certified seed from one of these growers for 1929 planting. To carry this project a little further, the "small grain specials" gathered at the State Fair, and which became the property of the Crop Growers' Association, and furnished the basis for the small grain exhibit, which was taken to the International Hay and Grain Show held at Chicago at the time of the International Live Stock Show. We also furnished an educational and corn exhibit, and erected an alfalfa house together with other information furnished regarding the grading and production of hay, which it is believed has tended to advertise Nebraska industries beyond the borders of our state. The expense of these Chicago exhibits was borne by The Greater Omaha Committee, acknowledgement and thanks for which is made at this time. We have held for the fifth year a State Corn Yield Contest in which 175 men participated and 90 men finished up. The crop growers cooperated in furnishing the supervision and appropriate medals in the several zones into which the state has been divided. This work has also brought out county contests in several of the counties of the state, and it is hoped that the work will be taken up in other counties. A demonstration train known as the "Wheat Harvest Special" was run in the state during the year. It was sponsored by the Chicago &amp; Northwestern and Union Pacific Railroad lines, and its exhibits were visited by some 30,000 interested farmers. Your society cooperated with the railroads and the College of. Agriculture in conducting this train. While the work of your officers in attending meetings of the Seed Council of North America, and starting the work in Nebraska is not spectacular, yet it should be recorded that Nebraska has taken her </seg>
            <seg id="p115">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION place in this work. Again at the annual meeting: of the International Crop Improvement Association a state membership has been taken out, and we were represented at the Chicago meeting this year by both your secretary and president. We have, as a society, again sponsored the Corn Show at the meet - ings of Western Nebraska Organized Agriculture held this year at Alliance, where we also furnished appropriate prizes for both alfalfa and sweet clover seed. We are again carrying on the corn show as part of our program at the winter meetings in Lincoln, though it must be stated that the benefits to be derived from corn shows are beginning to be questioned by even some of our membership. The "small grain specials" have been returned from Chicago, and can be seen in the room where the corn show is being held. As a project we have aided in stimulating the judging of field seeds by furnishing substantial aid to a judging team from the Ne - braska College of Agriculture, which represented our state university in the contests held at the time of the International Hay and Grain Show in Chicago. We have under consideration along the line of proposed expansion the setting up of a prize for Nebraska county agents who take the most active part in forwarding our program as part of their county projects, the idea being to furnish a cash prize or transportation to the International, and so stimulate and reward those most interested in the work of this society. As expressed by our secretary-treasurer, - the society at the close of the year finds itself in a thriving condition with money in both pockets and we look forward hopefully to another season of increased activity in this labor of love which we have undertaken for the better - ment of Nebraska. PRESIDENT MAGEE: It has been our custom to devote the first half day of our meeting to a discussion of rural economic problems. This morning we are to have a program dealing with farm records and farm organization. I now take pleasure in introducing to you Professor H. C. Filley, who is in charge of the Rural Economic Session this morning. PROFESSOR FILLEY: I regret to announce that our first speaker, Director W. H. Brokaw, is unable to be with us because of illness. To Dr. Seaman G. Knapp, for many years connected with the United States Department of Agriculture, goes the credit for starting </seg>
            <seg id="p116">REPORT QF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE what we now call the county agent movement Dr. Knapp learned that many farmers do not read the bulletins published by th^ United States Department of Agriculture and the state experiment stations, that not all farmers attend the farmers' institutes or short courses, and that in those meetings it is impossible to discuss ' ali the ' questions that come up to the farmers ' for decision during the course of the year. After studying the problem for many years, Dr. Knapp decided that a man who could stay on the ground in the county and act as a carrier of knowledge between the agricultural colleges on the one hand and the farmers on the other hand and between the farmers themselves would be a very useful man. Dr. Knapp's plan was put into operation in a few counties and worked so well that the Federal government appro - priated money to extend the system and there is now an agricultural agent in every county in many of our states. Dr. Knapp was a careful student of agricultural problems for many years. He once said that success in farming depended upon three factors in the following proportions: One-eighth upon science. Two-eighths upon a knowledge of the art of agriculture. Five-eighths upon business management. I feel very certain that in making this statement, Dr. Knapp did not mean to belittle the work of the scientists, for he was an ardent advocate of scientific investigation. He merely wished to emphasize the fact that the average man is much less dependent upon his knowl - edge of science for his success than upon other factors. Science teaches a farmer, for example, the life history of wheat smut and how it may be controlled. Many men are now using the copper-carbonate treatment for seed wheat who really have very little scientific knowledge concerning smut. They merely know that it causes them heavy losses if they sow untreated seed and because of this knowledge and their knowledge of certain arts of agriculture they are able to use the control measure recommended by the scientists. The knowledge of how to do the many tasks on the farm is really more im - portant to the average man than a knowledge of the scientific reasons for doing them in that particular way. Dr. Knapp had seen enough of success and failure in farming that he realized the importance of business management. The successful farmer must know not. only how to do a thing, but he must know when it can best be done; he must know how to distribute his labor through - out the year, and how and when to market his crops. He must make decisions every day that depend upon his business and managerial ability rather than upon his knowledge of either the science or art of agriculture. </seg>
            <seg id="p117">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION I recall an unusually successful farmer who employed two brothers for several years. He directed their work and they demonstrated to his satisfaction that they were well skilled in the arts of agriculture. This man finally bought a 240-acrc farm about twenty miles from where he lived and rented it to these two brothers. During the three years that they operated the farm it did not return to the owner enough to pay the taxes, insurance, and keep ■ up the improvements. The trouble was that while these men 1 could do good work when they had a supervisor, they were utterly lacking in the ability to utilize their time properly or to manage their own business. The owner sold the farm because he felt that tenant farming was not particularly profitable in his case. One of the most practical aids to the study of a farm business is a carefully kept farm account book. A man learns from the records of his own business. He learns which enterprises pay best and which ones result in a loss; he has an exact record of his expenditures at the end of the year and is in a position to decide whether or not certain expenditures were justified. When several men in a community keep books in cooperation with the Agricultural Extension Service, each man has the opportunity of learning from the experience of other men. The record book kept by the' farmer is summarized at the agricultural college and the farmer receives back an analysis of his own business and considerable data concerning other farms in his community. No names are used and the individuality of each farm is lost because groups of farmers are used for comparison rather than individual farms. Each man may compare his farm with the average five or ten most profitable farms of the group and also with five or ten of the least profitable farms of the group. It is helpful for any man to learn what factors have con - tributed to the success of other men. The deduction therefore seems logical that men who have not done particularly well can afford to study the farm practice of their more successful neighbors. The Illinois Agricultural College has done more work with farm records than any other institution of which I have any knowledge. Their progress is due quite largely to the untiring efforts of one man. When I first knew this man he was a teacher of farm management in the Illinois Agricultural College; a little later he spent two years in the United States Department of Agriculture as extension economist in farm management. This gave him an opportunity to visit everyone of our 48 states and learn what each state was doing to help farmers in the use of farm account books. The Illinois College of Agriculture then called this man back and placed him in charge of the investiga - tion and teaching of farm management. He has made an enviable record in that position. We were fortunate enough to secure him for </seg>
            <seg id="p118">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE our program today, and it is now my very great pleasure to introduce to you Professor H. C. M. Case, chairman of the Department of Farm Organization of the University of Illinois. COUNTING THE DOLLARS H. C. M. CASE In Charge of . Department of Farm Organization and Management, University of Illinois In coming to Nebraska for this meeting, I would like to have you think of what I may say as a message from Illinois farmers to Ne - braska farmers. I want to give you some of the facts learned about Illinois farms which are interesting to us in Illinois, and which, I hope, may bring helpful suggestions to you people Hin Nebraska. This message might more ac - curately be called "What Illinois Farmers Have Found Out About Their Business Through Keeping Farm Accounts." It should be kept clearly in mind that the earnings on any farm or any group of farms are more or less determined by two sets of conditions. On the one hand, there are those conditions external to the farm which are the result of rainfall, temperature, and other climatic conditions, together with business con - ditions which determine the general level of . farm prices. Most' of these conditions are H. c. m. Case things over which the individual farmer has no control, excepting as farmers working together may bring about conditions more favorable to agriculture.. On the other hand, however, there are those conditions on the individual farm which are largely under the control . of the operator. They are the things that determine why some farmers in a community make a much larger income than their neighbors. Even on the indi - vidual farm there are occasionally conditions over which the individual has no control, such as disease among animals, which may appear even though he is following the moat approved methods of sanitation and disease prevention. But, in general, these differences in earnings on farms in a small community are largely the result of the way the farms are organized and operated. </seg>
            <seg id="p119">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS 1 ASSOCIATION Returning to our topic, it may be said by way of introduction that in Illinois we expect to summarize records of approximately 1500 farmers for the year. 1928. These accounts are sent to our office for analysis and later are returned to the cooperating farmers. This work began in 1915. Out of it have come some interesting experiences which I hoDe will be of interest to you. At the beginning a farm account book containing only 36 pages was printed. As one of our co - operators expressed it, "It isn't a very interesting book to look at, but after I had kept my record in it for a year it told me a most in - teresting story." We tried various methods of interesting the farmers in keeping accounts, and selected the most successful of these methods for extending our work. In Woodford county, Illinois, in company with the county agent, .we actually started 60 different men to keeping our farm account books, by visiting them on their home farms and helping them to take the inventory of their farm and equipment, and later visiting these men once during the season to help them with any questions which had arisen. At the end of the year, each man was assisted in summarizing his record when he brought it in to a meeting place in a nearby town. At the end of the year it was gratifying to find that of the 60 men we had. started on the work, 48. or 80 per cent, brought their account books in to be summarized. Even though the war intervened, 19 of the original 48 men continued to keep their farm records each year for seven consecutive years, and others failed to do so only one or two years. -.. The work has now been extended, most of it being handled in group meetings, or when the individuals bring in their books to nearby 1x&gt;wns. There are now more than 85 counties in Illinois who are co - operating with this work. In every community where there are more than 30 books completed in a county, or in adjoining counties where farming conditions are similar, a special report is prepared, based on the records secured in that community. Some people insist on referring to our department as the "farm acccuntintt department," tut this does not express the purpose of the work. The real object in developing this project is "to help farmers to organize, and operate .their farms on a more profitable basis." The fact that hundreds of these men are keeping their records each year for analysis is the best indication I know of that a service is being rendered which thoy appreciate and find helpful to them. A group of 40 or 50 records selected from almost any part of the state would tell very much the same story, but for our discussion will be used the results from the same 175 farms on which records were kept each year for a three-year period under careful supervision. These men were all enrolled in what is called the Farm Bureau-Farm Management Service work. This is a direct development of the farm </seg>
            <seg id="p120">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE accounting work begun a good many years ago. Woodford county was mentioned as being the place where some of the most definite work was started back in 1916. By 1921 more than 100 men in that county were keeping records. It was found that so much time was required in helping farmers in that one county that it. was necessary to propor - tion the time available to different counties over the state. The farm - ers in Woodford county were told that we could not continue to give them as much service on the same basis. They replied, however, that they wanted more,, rather than less help. The old cooperators were practically unanimous in saying that they were willing to pay for the service if necessary in order to have as much or more help than they had had in the past. The question was put to one of the men in this way: "You have received this service for a number of years and know how to keep your records. You also know the kind of an analysis that can be made from them. Do you consider the work has been of definite value to you?" This was the "first man interviewed, and I remember distinctly his answer: "If I could not secure this service without paying for it, it would be worth one hundred — yes, two hun - dred dollars a year to me." Another man said, "I believe, judging from my own experience, that the statement you have made in Illinois bulletin 252 is fully warranted." The statement referred to was this: "The 19 farmers who kept records for the seven-year period realized an average net income in 1922 that was larger by approximately $650 than would have been the case had they not used the accounts to de - termine how they might improve the farm business." Without going into detail regarding the organization of the' work, it may be stated briefly that at the beginning of 1925 more than 200 farmers signed up for a three-year period to pay from $5 to $20 each annually for the farm management service work. The College met about an equal amount of expense. Attention may now be given to the results secured on 175 farms selected out of this group on which complete records were available for each of the three years, and all of which were located on the same type of soil. It was brown silt loam, which represents the most pro - ductive type of soil existing over large areas of our state. These farms were quite comparable as far as their market opportunities and weather conditions were concerned. The differences were due largely to the way the farms were organized and operated. Of the group of 175 farmers, 35 made an average of approximately $3,000 more net earnings a year each of the three years than 35 other farmers in the group in the same community. It should be recognized -that all of these farmers were rather highly selected. Not only were they members of the farm bureau, but they were selected from the members who were willing to pay for </seg>
            <seg id="p121">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION this additional service they were getting. One would expect them to make larger profits than the average of all farmers in the same part of the state. A careful study of all farms in. one township about in the center of the area where .the 175 farms were located, showed that in one | year the average of the account keepers made more than $1,000 a farm more than the average of all the farmers in the one township. The (most successful of these men, in general, have spent from five years to a generation in improving the soil, selecting good varieties of crops, establishing good cropping systems, developing efficient herds of live - stock, and in equipping their farms for economical operation in ac - cordance with carefully thought-out plans. This explains why the best 35 farmers of the group made approximately $3,000 more than the same sized group of men who were keeping records, but who had the lowest earnings. While farm earnings have been low in general throughout this period of three years, the experience of these better men shows clearly that it is worth while to follow good farming practices and to keep the records which will make it possible to find out just where the weak spots in the farm business are located. The records on these farms were kept in a way which enabled finding out just how much of this $3,000 difference in earnings in each of the three years could be attributed to any one particular thing. The analysis of the farms on this basis showed that the differences in earnings could be attributed to certain factors, as follows: Yields of crops $ 831 Amount of livestock kept 657 Efficiency of livestock in using feed 557 Kinds of crops grown 304 Differences in prices received for grain 280 Cost of power and machinery: 216 Cost of man labor 49 Other recorded expenses 28 Total yearly differences per farfn due to above factors $2,922 These farms had an average investment of more than $60,000, and the best 35 made about 5 per cent on the investment more than the lowest 35 farms of the group. The results shown in the above chart are similar to those found during the past fifteen years that the College has cooperated with Illinois farmers in keeping farm accounts. From these studies we </seg>
            <seg id="p122">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE have determined quite definitely certain principles which seem to underlie good farming in any section of the country. The remainder of the discussion will be centered around these principles, which are eleven in number. i 1. Good Yields Reduce the Cost of Producing a Bushel or Ton of Farm Crops Larger yields of corn, oats and wheat accounted for $831 of the difference in earnings on the thirty-five more profitable farms and those on the thirty-five least profitable of the 175 farms. The most profitable farms had 8.7 bushels more corn, 5.8 bushels more oats, and 4.5 bushels more wheat per acre than those in the least profitable group. These differences in yield had little influence on the coat of production^ other than the cost of harvesting. The value in the addi - tional yields therefore represents a difference in net profits. Some of the practices that help produce good crop yields include a good crop rotation, the use of limestone . and phosphate where needed, the growing of clover and other legumes, the feeding of crops on the farm where they are grown, the selection of high yielding varieties of crops, testing seed for germination and disease, seed treatment, and preventive measures for control of disease and insect pests. It must be recognized that after a century of farming the productivity of Illinois land has been lowered and it harbors more diseases and insect pests than formerly. 2. A Large Percentage of the Land in Higher Profit Crops Means Larger Profits A larger proportion of the land seeded to the higher profit crops accounted for $304 of the difference between earnings on the thirty-five most profitable and those on the thirty-five least profitable of the 175 farms. Fifteen years of cost accounting data collected in central Illinois by the College of Agriculture show that the high-profit crops are corn as the cultivated crop, wheat as the small grain crop, alfalfa as the hay crop, and sweet clover as the pasture crop on tillable land. Oats, timothy hay, and bluegrass pasture on tillable land are the low-profit crops. 3. Livestock Production as a Means of Marketing Crops Makes For Larger Farm Income The larger amount of livestock produced accounted for $657 of the difference between earnings on the thirty-five most profitable farms and those on the thirty-five least profitable of the 175 farms. </seg>
            <seg id="p123">. NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION The 175 farms, on an average, received $151 return from livestock for each $-100 worth of feed fed. The most profitable group of farms had $12.75 an acre invested in productive livestock, compared with only $8.94 on the least profitable farms. This difference in the amount of livestock accounted for the larger return received because of the larger return for the feed when consumed than when sold. 4. Efficient Feeding and Handling of Livestock Materially Reduces the Cost of Production The larger return received from feeding an equal amount of feed accounted for $557 of the difference between the earnings on the thirty-five most profitable farms and those on the thirty-five least profitable of the 175 farms. The 175 farms as an average fed $1,983 worth of feed to livestock other than horses. The thirty-five most profitable farms on an average received $163 return for $100 worth of feed fed, compared with a re - turn of only $135 on the thirty-five least profitable farms. The differ - ence of $28 higher return for each $100 worth of feed fed on the more profitable farms may be attributed to a number of factors, including better types of breeding, stock, careful study, of market conditions in buying and selling livestock, following approved plans for keeping livestock healthy and controlling disease, use of rotated legume pas - tures, providing home grown feeds as for as possible to supply a bal - anced ration, and purchasing feed and minerals of known feeding value only. &gt;. A Large Volume of Business Is Necessary for Profitable Farming The thirty-five most profitable farms were so organized and oper - ated that they received an income of $28.75 an acre, compared with an income of $16.98 an acre on the less profitable farms. The expenses were the lowest on the more profitable farms. The difference of $11.17 an acre in the income of the two groups of farms may be accounted, for mainly in the four factors already dis - cussed, namely: larger yields, a large proportion of high-profit crops, more livestock, and more efficient livestock management. Dairying, hog raising, and poultry production are the best live - stock enterprises for providing a larger volume of business without adding to the size of the farm. Most farms in central Illinois are large enough to provide a good volume of business if they are properly organized. Many farms in other parts of Illinois need a larger acreage to provide a good volume ! of business. </seg>
            <seg id="p124">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 6. Well Organized Farms Use Available Labor to Advantage The thirty-five most profitable farms used twenty-three &lt;ients les« for man labor per acre than the thirty-five least profitable farms, but produced 'an income of ?11.77 more to the acre. The cost of man labor an acre on the most profitable farms was $6.75, while on the least profitable farms it was $6.98 per acre. This difference is more significant when it is considered that the income was nearly twice as high per acre on the most profitable farms. Some of the things which provide for good use of man labor are: a cropping system that spreads the use of labor throughout the year, the production and feeding of livestock to provide for productive winter work, a production plan that will use available seasonal labor, especially boys when they are not in school, planning odd jobs so that they will not interfere with work which must be done at a stated time, and arranging the fields and farmstead to save time. 7. Costs Are Reduced When the Supply of Horse and Mechanical Power Fits the Farm Needs The thirty-five most profitable farms spent $216 less per farm for horse and tractor power and machinery than the thirty-five least profit - able farms. The cost of power and machinery on the most profitable farms was only $4.25 per acre as compared with a cost of $5.18 on the less profitable farms, although the income was nearly twice as high per acre on the more profitable farms. Ways in which some of the men kept power and machinery costs low include: keeping machinery protected from the weather and regu - larly repaired during odd times, giving special attention to more com - plicated machines to prevent heavy depreciation and repair bills, select - ing only such equipment as can be used economically, keeping only the necessary horses, and feeding them according to work done. 8. Buildings, Machinery, and. Other Equipment Costs Must Be Kept Under Control if. Low Production Costs Are to Be Obtained Aside from power and machinery costs already mentioned, the thirty-five most profitable farms expended $28 less per farm on other expenses than the thirty-five least profitable farms. While these differences may seem small, it must be recognized again that these lower costs were obtained even with a much larger gross income. Ways in which all operating costs may be kept at a low level include: the operation, of a sufficient body of land to spread </seg>
            <seg id="p125">NEBRASKA. CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION building costs over a larger acreage, provision of adequate but inex - pensive equipment, use of buildings -which can be made to serve various purposes, arrangement of the farm with large fields to save fencing, use of temporary fences which are cheaper than permanent ones, and doing all possible building and repair work with farm labor at odd times. 9. A Good Farm Layout and Well Developed Farmstead Make for Economical Operation The influence of good planning has a direct bearing on the pre - ceding three factors — the advantageous use of man labor, fitting the power supply to farm needs, and the control of building, machinery, - and other equipment costs. A common mistake on Cornbelt farms is to consider each improve - ment as it is made rather than to work toward a complete plan. As fences are rebuilt and buildings erected they should be placed in accordance with a well thought out plan which will provide a good field area for the crops and economical handling of crops and livestock about the buildings in order to keep down farm operation costs. A well developed plan cannot be put into operation at once, but each farm improvement should be made in accordance with such a plan. 10. Diversity of Production Helps Insure Long-Time Profits The advantages of diversity in crop production include: (1) the maintenance or improvement of the soil, especially if legume crops are included in the rotation; (2) provision for better distribution in the use of labor, power and equipment throughout the year; (3) provides some insurance against complete crop failure; (4) control of plant diseases and insects; (5) provides more of the feeds needed in live - stock production; (6) a succession of deep- and shallow-rooted plants; (7) easier weed control. Diversity of income also is generally desirable. Some successful farms, however, receive a large part of their income from one or two sources, even though they may have a diversity of crop production. This is especially true of many dairy farms and some other livestock farms. Even though many such farms are successful, there is less risk from disease, unfavorable weather conditions, or poor prices on farms selling a diversity of products. 11. Production Planned in Accordance With Market Demand Makes for a Larger Profit The higher price received from the sale of corn, oats, and wheat which made up about 60 per cent of the farm receipts accounted for $280 of the difference between earnings on the 35 most profitable </seg>
            <seg id="p126">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE and those on the 35 least profitable farms. Much of this difference was due to a better quality of the crops on many of the farms that received the higher price. That is, the higher price was due to the grade of grain taken to the market. This has come about through careful selection of high-yielding varieties adapted to the community, testing seed, and good care of the crops after they are grown. There is a great deal to be gained, however, in studying market conditions and in growing the crops and livestock that are wanted on the market and in marketing them at the . right time of year. Too frequently men are guided by price at the present time rather than anticipating what the conditions will be at the time the products are ready to go to market. This cannot always be done, but much is to be gained by studying markets, especially with reference to livestock pro - duction. The numbers of livestock that will come to market is indi - cated in information which is available some time in advance, as to size of breeding herds and the numbers of animals in the country. While the discussion cannot be carried further in regard to "produc - tion for the market" there is enough to be said on this topic to occupy a full session.

The heavy black line across the middle of the chart, shows the average for all farms in each of the factors named at the bottom of the chart, while the height of the bars in relation to this line shows the standing of a particular farm for each of the factors. Applying Farm Management Principles to Farming The foregoing discussion indicates that many factors play a part in determining the success of any particular farm. Even though a man has kept records of his business, it is difficult to study a lot of figures which one may secure in a way which will give a good idea of the entire farm business. The accompanying charts of two farms (Figure 6), which we frequently refer to as the "thermometer" charts, show the standing of two particular farms selected from among the 175 with reference to each of the more important principles empha - sized above. The figures in the middle of the chart indicate the average results on the entire 175 farms. The height of the black columns show a man's standing oh each of these factors with reference to the -average. The conclusion to be drawn frcm such an analysis is that the best farm is not necessarily that which is especially good at some one point, but is the farm which is not poor at any point. It is of interest to note that in returning records to over 600 cooperatora in one year only one farm was found which was above the average of the farms in j that community with respect to each of the factors studied. </seg>
            <seg id="p128">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE In conclusion, it may be said that farm accounts properly inter - preted are the most reliable guide in helping to secure a well-balanced farm business. QUESTION: Does that net income include his wages and net income from the farm too? MR. CASE: We have allowed the man only a hired man's wages; we have taken $720 plus what he gets off the farm, so this net income represents what he has left to pay the interest on the investment in the farm itself. Most of them have not made good interest on the invest - ment. One group made 6.7 per cent on their investment QUESTION: The income of a man competent to run a farm like that should be at least $2400 a year. MR. CASE: I agree with you, but that is one of the externals which control the level of prices, over which he has not very much control as an individual. I have talked only about those things which are internal in the farm itself. QUESTION: How do you test seed corn for disease? MR. CASE: A great many of the farmers in Illinois are beginning to test corn for disease and test it as it comes out of the germinator; it will show disease starting at a very early stage. We have many men setting up little plants out through the state to test corn for this disease. QUESTION: Are there any bulletins available with the charts in? MR. CASE: We have these mimeographed summary reports of the Farm Bureau, and the Farm Management Service. Address me at Urbana, Illinois, and I will send you the bulletin. QUESTION: What would be, on the average farm, the proper amount for the interest on investment and taxes? MR. CASE: This one farm, as I recall it, has nearly $60,000 in - vested and made over 5 per cent teturn, in addition to the $720 allowed for wages. The interest on $60,000 at 5 per cent is $3,000.00. This man's income from 160 acres including his wage allowance was nearly $4,000.00. QUESTION: Put your average farmer on there and there wouldn't be much left. MR. CASE: He has a minus labor income. QUESTION: That is central Illinois? MR. CASE: Yes. </seg>
            <seg id="p129">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS" ASSOCIATION QUESTION: That is somewhat similar to eastern Nebraska? MR. CASE: On the average,' very similar. There is some difference in livestock production. Small herds of six or eight cows, a good many hogs, and some beef cattle. PROFESSOR FILLEY: If any of your folks are interested par - ticularly in' farm account work as it applies to the individual, I hope that you will talk with Mr. Arthur George or Mr. Ralph Cole, who represent respectively the Rural Economics Department and the Agri - cultural Extension Service. These men work in the field together and those of you who are keeping records in cooperation with us have probably been visited by one or both of them. They will be glad to an - swer your questions and give you all the information that they can. If some, one of you men here heard a physician tell the results of his operations, and show on a chart how many he had cured, you would doubtless be interested in talking with the patients. Some men are inclined to be a little skeptical about the figures presented by a college professor. They have heard that - college professors are theoretical rather than practical. You have heard a professor tell his story, and now it is time to see whether or not his theory really works. We have two real live exhibits from Illinois — two men who have been keeping farm records. We might call them exhibits A and B. I visited both of these farmers on their farms and saw them with their working clothes on. Each man who will talk was visited rather late in the afternoon when he was at work in the field. We looked over the buildings and the livestock and decided it would be worth while to look up the farmer himself. I do not know whether the first man to speak, Mr. Victor Davison, is a dirt farmer or not, because I have never learned just what a dirt farmer is. Mr. Davison farms in partnership with his brother on a large farm, and the farm looks as if it were operated by a master farmer. He will tell us something about the influence of farm records upon his community and upon his own system of farming. Mr. Davison has been county farm bureau president in the county where this work has been carried on. Mr. Davison. </seg>
            <seg id="p130">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE WHAT FARM MANAGEMENT MEANS TO THE COMMUNITY VICTOR H. DAVISON, Minonk, Illinois Professor Filley got me into a trap right off the bat. Mr. Brokaw and these other Nebraska men came, into the field where I was plowing and asked me how long I had been keeping records: I said, "Ten or eleven years." Then Professor Filley said, "We are just out this afternoon calling upon a few men who have kept records to find out what they really think of them; just tell us a few of the things H which have been actual benefits to you." And I started right in telling him our troubles, what we had tried to do, and what we had been doing in the ten years to remedy our troubles. And these men stood and listened a little bit, and finally I think it was Mr. Brokaw turned to. Professor Filley and said, "Here is the man we want." And the thought came to me that these fel - lows had fallen for a lot of wind I had shoved at them pretty fast. I wanted to get rid of them — and they brought me out here to Ne- Victor h. Dnvison braska. The topic I am to talk about is de - cidedly different from the one Mr. Case dis - cussed and the one Mr. Parks is to bring to you. I could talk to you better, I am sure, upon the question of analyzing our own farm records. I am farming, with my brother, on land owned largely by my father, a partnership of three. I have a proposition to present here that deals more with the com - munity in general where farm management work is being carried on successfully. Professor Case has told you of specific benefits derived from farm management work, the benefits that come from the natural contact with these men who are at our service to analyze these farm management records year by year and bring them to us. First, of course, is the financial benefit spread over the farm of the man who has co-operated. I want also to state two or three benefits that cannot be measured in dollars and cents. First is the satisfaction that comes to a man who has proved to himself from these records that he is getting somewhere, that he is succeeding, improving, building himself up, that his record is showing a better net rate earning every year, that something is being accomplished. I wonder sometimes just what the man feels who is not keeping records. We depend on our records absolutely; it has been ten years since we started in this work </seg>
            <seg id="p131">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS 1 ASSOCIATION and we have sort of forgotten how it feels to be without records to show our farm leaks. I used to think when Mr. Case and Mr. Mosier brought around these charts about when we were waiting for our discharge after the war. We were pretty close to a negro regiment. They got their pay checks the day before we got ours, and they were going it pretty strong. on gambling, and we walked over to see them. One great big darkey was very enthusiastic about his gambling, and as he threw the dice he would shout, "Read them and weep, big boy, read them and weep." After reading our records the first few years, we certainly felt like weeping. . And if you have these records to read year in and year out, that helps you as much probably as the dollars and cents shown on the charts. We have a cousin who is cashier in a farm community bank, and he says the thing they are up against, the thing they are fighting, is the tendency of men to quit at the time of all times when liquidation would mean ruin not only to the farmer himself, but to the bank. They have to encourage their patrons to keep going and it is this encourage - ment that means more probably than anything else. It is the fact that we are doing better that keeps us encouraged and also that this specific chart shows our points of leakage, and that gives us something to think about. The farmer who does not have these specific points in mind, I imagine, thinks in a general way that there is a certain time to plant oats and that the first of May is the time to plant corn. A man is not apt to think of his farm leaks and how to remedy them or of the man - agement problems unless he does take up some of this farm manage - ment work. . These are the three specific points I want to emphasize: the finan - cial benefit, the satisfaction that he is getting somewhere, moving for - ward, and. that these definite points of contact give him something to think about and to strive for. Now what does all this have to do with the farm community? You will pardon me if I take you back to the northeast corner of Woodford county, and you will pardon me if I refer to my community as a won - derful community, because you do the same with yours. However, I do want to bring out one or two things in connection with farm manage - ment work that I think have raised the level of our community within the last ten years. I want to start by saying. that by "community" I mean the territory within a radius of two or three miles around our homestead. We have one fact in our community that maybe some of you do not have. Within a radius of two and a half miles of our home place are eighteen people who are either college graduates or who have attended a college or university. That is rather uncommon, with us at </seg>
            <seg id="p132">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE least. That would present a pretty tough proposition to some com - munities. I do not want to belittle a college education. But there is this feeling oftentimes growing up between college men and non-college men, — there is just a little friction and you know about it as well as I do. A college man will take up farm management work because he is a respecter of facts. A college man, if figures are accurate, will take them as gospel truth. And these figures are sufficiently simple so that any man, even a man without education, can prove to himself exactly what he is doing. This keeping of farm accounts brings the college man and the non-college man together and measures them with the same yard-stick, and you will find some, not all, but some of your best developed farmers are among the non-college groups. Not all of them. I want to give the college man credit for this one thing — in our com - munity, — I cannot speak for all communities, — but in our community, we give credit to the college man who is in the farm management work for those little items of development which spread out faster on the farm of the college man. He seems to have gained something that in - duces progress which is a little faster improvement on what has been done in the past. . ... There is a very noticeable difference in this community between the man who is a co-operator in the farm management work and one who is not a co-operator. We have one aggressive college man who has had trouble with disease among his hogs; he has started upon a plan of his own for hog raising, a plan that is decidedly different from anything we ever heard of before. The non-co-operator in that community is certainly giving that man some pointers. There are men who criticize, but the co-operators, in that community are the men who want that plan to succeed, because if it does, we can all take it up and go on with it. Then the biggest factor perhaps in the community development is that it picks out in your community those men who are most efficient along certain lines. I will refer to another man, a college man, who in our community is an expert in the raising of pure bred hogs. The pure bred hog business has not been any too good in recent years, but this man has become unusually efficient in hog production. Although he is somewhat handicapped because he is a renter, he, nevertheless, holds annual sales and apparently secures a good profit I am not well enough acquainted with his chart to know just what he is doing. Then we have a man in the community who for a long, long time has been breeding Shorthorn cattle, and he. has been up against this feeding problem and the relationship of pasture crops to other feed and he has become a highly efficient worker. He is a non-college man. We have a poultry man, a college man. Then we have a man whose yields </seg>
            <seg id="p133">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION are outstanding in that community, and he is being pushed very heavily by a man who is a non-coilege man. Now don't mistake me, I do not want to belittle the effect of an agricultural education. I would not do that at all. But the farm management work is being done by the college man and the non-college man on the same basis, and the same men are scrapping it out, and just where you might have friction between the two classes of people you are bringing them together. These men are just specialists that we have in our community. We don't have, to go away from our community to find these men who are specialists. Some of them have been known to us for their entire lives, and they have kept their records and we can go to them for records which they have kept. I told Mr. Filley and the other Nebraska men what we learned about our hog business. I started in with the fact that our returns for 100 pounds of feed fed was very low, and we traced that to the hogs. Something had to be done to bring that up or we might just as well quit raising hogs. We talked to the efficient hog man mentioned above and we found out why our returns were low. We were not feeding a well balanced ration. The relationship between the protein and the carbo - hydrates that we were feeding was not satisfactory. I want to say for the ! benefit of- these young men who are taking agricultural courses and may be looking forward to this farm manage - ment work and a directorship of it, I think one of the specific benefits that we have derived from this farm management work has been the fact that what we do know about the other co-operators has been gained from the co-operators themselves. We can go to the men and get their records. One of the important things that gives us faith in the econ - omists who direct this farm management work is that they never divulge any secrets gained from one family to another.- We have a doctor in our community, and he is a good doctor, but when you go to see him about any of your troubles you find out the troubles of the whole com - munity, and that is not as it should be. Talking these problems over together brings about a community interest which you cannot have in any other way. And this farm man - agement work brings about a. new relationship between landlord and tenant, provided they are co-operating in the work. It puts the farm work upon a business-like basis. The landlord knows exactly where the tenant stands on the items which directly affect him. From the same chart the tenant can prove his efficiency in the feeding of livestock and in the use of power for farming, and the different items which concern him; and we find a business-like basis upon which farming can bo done. Oftentimes there is a sort of antagonistic feeling between landlord and tenant, and it brings that down to a business-like proposition so that we think farming is a' business in itself , and not a matter of how much each ■one can get out of the farm. </seg>
            <seg id="p134">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE In our community we have eleven co-operators at the present time. All of these eleven men are striving with the help of their records to be successful farmers. Each one of them has his weaknesses that concern him directly. The farm management work seems to have given them an encouragement to look forward to being more successful as time goes on, and it gives them something by which to measure their suc - cesses. We have eleven men who can take advantage of the experiences of the other ten. By co-operation among ourselves in methods and plans and things which are brought- out by the other ten men, and as a community, as a bunch of men together, we take advantage of each other's good points, and ask questions of the other men concerning our weak points and try to bring to each and every one his important part in that co-operation. Then we have eleven farmers who have learned to think definitely along one line, the line of improving through their management. This gives these farmers something to talk about when they get together. It gives them something to discuss and leaves .not quite so much time to cuss; and it has proven beneficial in that respect. This is, if I may say it, raising the level of the community and the community interest we have one in another. These eleven farmers have become, to a certain extent, optimistic, because they have proved to their own satisfaction that they are getting somewhere. It helps a lot in any business, and especially in the condition agriculture is in at the present time, to have any little encouragement we can get. Keeping records gives something specific in the way of encouragement to each and every one of us who has found an optimistic viewpoint in our neighborhood, and as the result of the efforts of these eleven men we have a community which co-operates. We have not the time, I might say, to pick up frictions among ourselves, we have no time to criticize one another, we have not the time to think about things other than those which pertain to the improvement -of our records there upon our own farms; and this gives to us an appreciation of each other, and a thank - fulness that we have within our community specialists who have certain lines developed there, and to whom we may go for consideration and help in the way of our own particular problems. I just want to leave this thought with you, that in the question of farm management and its relationship to the community, that the raising of the standard of the community raises the standard of that realm wherein you will probably spend most of your life. It has proven to us a satisfaction that cannot always be measured in dollars and cents as Professor Case has brought to you. This point remains, and though the financial benefit may be the greatest one we are seeking at the present time, yet we cannot forget the community in which we live and the benefits which may accrue to it from the farm management work. We have our community meetings; we let our good wives start that; they have a community organization, their Woman's Club, and </seg>

QUESTION: What about the power, and the source of power and labor machinery on the Davison farm? MR. DAVISON: This use of farm machinery in reducing labor cost has been a factor which my brother and I in operating a 520-acre farm have been fortunate enough to bring to a pretty efficient level. We operate this with one hired man ordinarily, and occasionally another man who helps. That makes three men regularly, and once in a while a fourth man. We do it with a heavy outlay of power machinery, but have not done it at the expense of raising the machinery investment abnormally high. With a large farm it is possible, as Mr. Case has said, to prove these records, whether or not it is a paying proposition to have a tractor on your farm. We have been operating with a' tractor which is now five or six years old. We have a silo and feed some cattle. We bought one of the new silo fillers which cuts the corn in the field, and that has proved a valuable thing in reducing the cost of silo filling. We have a combine that we have used for two years and it has been quite a factor in cutting down harvesting expense. Our cultivating is done with three 2-row horse-drawn cultivators and this saves a lot of time in a very busy season of the year. We had 260 acres of corn this year. Our records show that although we have not been as efficient as the average of our group in securing returns from feed fed, that we have been very efficient in using machinery. Now would it pay us to have a higher labor cost per acre and use an extra man to raise our return for 100 pounds of feed fed? The things you can think about, and the things you can figure up, certainly make these records inter - esting. QUESTION: I wouldn't think a combine would be worth much in Illinois, where your straw is worth so much. MR. DAVISON: We gathered 33 good big loads of straw in a day and a half by the use of a dump rake and hay loader. That was plenty to run us through the entire year. That was a day and a half of not particularly hard work. QUESTION: How many cattle on the farm? MR. DAVISON: At the present time 13 head of milk cows; ordi - narily we feed steers in the winter-time. We had plenty of straw last year to bed. QUESTION: What kind of cows do you milk? MR. DAVISON: Shorthorns. </seg>
            <seg id="p136">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTORE QUESTION: Do you list or check your corn? MR. D AVISON : We check our corn. It is cultivated three times. QUESTION: Do you have a power corn husker? MR. DAVISON: We have, and it has proved to us to be a- very good piece of machinery to own. QUESTION: Doesn't your corn go down sometimes? MR. DAVISON: It surely did this year; we are fixed to follow up with cattle and steers and pick it up immediately. QUESTION: How many horses do you have? MR. DAVISON: At the present time, eight. QUESTION: The stalks are worthless for feed after the machine has gone over them, aren't they? MR. DAVISON: No; it throws them over and it makes a sort of arch of them. : - QUESTION: Do you cut oats with a combine? MR. DAVISON: Yes. QUESTION: How do you handle your seed corn? MR. DAVISON: Ordinarily we pick the. seed as soon as we are sure it is matured, before we start picking the corn. We use the up - stairs of a frame shop and the corn is hung up in the ear; we have one of the germinators and we ear test our corn for disease and germination. PROFESSOR FILLEY: I was very much interested in what Mr. Daviscn said this morning regarding his community and the large num - ber of college graduates in that community. I doubt if we have a com - munity in this state where that could be duplicated. IJut the point he brought out concerning the relationship between the college graduate and the non-college graduate was very interesting. I want to say something about the agricultural college. I believe we give to the boy who attends the agricultural college an opportunity to learn more rapidly from the experience of other men than he is apt to learn at home on the farm, or engaged in business, or in any other occupation. When a' man is attending college he is learning from the experiences of other men, whether he is studying botany, or soils, or crops, or economics, or livestock feeding. The college gives to the boy a chance to learn those experiences a little more rapidly than if he is outside of college. Most of the things that a boy learns in college he can learn outside of college; of course it is difficult to learn much chemistry without a' laboratory, but the things that a man gets from reading and. studying may be </seg>
            <seg id="p137">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION learned at home. The college merely hastens the process of learning. And in connection with this farm management demonstration work I wonder if we cannot suggest that it gives all the men in a community an opportunity to learn some of the things that students are studying in college. They really have more interest because instead of learning from a set of exercises, each man uses the record of his own business and compares his results with the results obtained by the group of which he is a member. We can, therefore, say that any man, regardless of his previous training, is receiving one of the practical features of a college education When he keeps a record of his farm business. We are trying to teach many things in college that many men learn outside of school. We believe that the college gives a student the opportunity of learning more rapidly than he can possibly learn outside of school. I now want to introduce a second Illinois farmer whose farm we visited last fall. We found it a very interesting place to study, and I am sure the only regret of our group of five men was that they could not stay a' little longer and find out from Mr. Parke some of the inter - esting things he was doing. He will tell us this afternoon some of the things he has learned during the past 12 years from keeping accounts. It is a ' great pleasure to introduce to you Mr. Fred Parke, Master Farmer, of Minonk, Illinois. TWELVE YEARS OF FARM MANAGEMENT EXPERIENCE FRED PARKE Some one spoke of us this morning as "Specimens". Anyway, I am very glad to appear before you as Exhibit Number 2 after 12 years of continuous treatment. If you had known me at the beginning I doubt if you would notice any great change with the exception of an accumula - tion of averdupois and years, and I have never known the most ardent exponent of this farm management system to claim it would help one reduce or maintain perpetual youth. In the last few days we have seen that in California five men with a powerful airplane have overcome the forces of gravity and remained aloft for 144 hours. That is an epoch-making event. During the last seven years seven million farmers and their families have been up in the air almost continuously with very little to sustain them insofar as making both ends meet is concerned. That, too,, is an epoch-making event. Many things have been offered to the farmers in the way of help. Some of them are carefully considered and valuable, and others have been considered only superficially and are of little value. Now !we have something which is comparatively new in this co-operative sys - tem of farm management and the keeping of accounts. If this system will not help the individual farmer to increase his net farm income we (5) </seg>

            <seg id="p140">I REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE do not want to give it any particular consideration. But on the other hand, if it will help the farmer to increase his net farm income we do want to consider it Whether it will do this I will not attempt to answer directly, but will give you the story of our farm. I understand perfectly that this particular farm is of no particular interest to you except that things that can be done on this farm can be done on other farms of similar soil and climatic conditions. It is not the highest producing farm in our community, but it may be of interest to ycu if I tell you the improvement that has been made in the earning power of this piece of ground. We call our farm Spring Farm. My mother gave it that name because of an ever-flowing spring which keeps the horse tank full in summer and never freezes in the winter. It flows 75 or 100 barrels a day and overflows the tank down near the end of the lot and keeps the hogs and cattle well supplied with water. I have here a chart showing the farm and the buildings and locations of the different things on the farm. I mention these three things, the spring, the lay of the farm, and the ditch, because taken collectively they distinguish this farm from others in our community. History of Farm Now just a word as to the history of this farm. It has been farmed on a corn and oat rotation from the time of the Civil War down to the time I started operating it in 1913, with the exception of a few years in the eighties when livestock was kept to make use of the overflowed ground as pasture land. Many changes have been made in the farm since 1913, and I do not remember all the details of its operation at that time. Some things I do remember. In 1913 we had thirteen fields varying in size from 2 acres to 78 acres. That was a factor of high expense; the large number of fields necessitated moving machinery and men frequently from one part of the farm to another. When we commenced to operate the farm the soil was in poor condition and would break up in large chunks when we plowed. During a long period of dry weather the ground would open in large cracks until we could put a hand and wrist in the cracks. We would plant corn which would come up and germinate and grow three or four inches and then forget all about growing. It would turn yellow and would stay there for a period of time. And while this was going on the vines were growing. I do not know whether you have any vines here in Nebraska; we call them the wild sweet potato; some call it the morning glory vine, and when we, get into a patch of them we would call them almost anything. They accumulate rapidly, and grow from both seed and' roots. One year we had seven cultivators working a day and a half cultivating 28 acres of corn, on account of the vines. The result of this problem was that the yields were usually unsatis- </seg>
            <seg id="p141">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION factory. Forty-four bushels of corn to the acre, was the best corn we grew under those conditions and that. was a dry season and we hap - pened to have the overflow ground in corn. In 1915 our corn crop averaged 31 bushels to the acre, and in 1917, 32 bushels. We seeded about 258 acres in red clover during the first two years. We did not get a good stand of clover. The seed would sprout and then die. Under those conditions the net returns 'from that farm were, as you can imagine, quite unsatisfactory. In self-defense I will say I wanted to improve this farm. I had never gone to the agricultural college and I was young enough and ignorant enough that I did not wish to ask for advice. As a result of my attitude my folks did not want to give me too much advice; so while I had it in my mind that I would have to grow clover if I improved the farm, still I didn't have sufficient confi - dence in limestone to ask my father, who was the landlord, where to buy the limestone and I didn't do it. We had three alternatives open to us, first to continue the farm as we had been doing, second to leave the farm, and third to plant clover and try to redeem it. A few days ago I heard a man from the Dairy Department of the Illinois 'Agricultural College, and he concluded his remarks by making an appeal in the strongest terms for farming as a mode of living. He said that while farmers now constituted one-half of the future genera - tion, and he didn't want to see this future generation, or half of it, be - coming a hopeless set of people, and so he made. the appeal for farming as a mode of living. You and I know, whether we like to think it or not, that idealism does not maintain a condition. There is one thing which will maintain our standard of living on a farm and that is an adequate cash income. We know that we are past the days of sorghums and hoecake. And I am convinced that there is nothing in the world that will maintain our standard of living in America on the farm except an adequate cash income. I know by the questions asked this morning that that is a question about which we have been wondering for quite a while. About this time, after I had farmed for two years, our Farm Bureau was organized. Mr. Mosher, who was mentioned this morning, came as our adviser. I asked him when he came to our side of the county to stop at our farm and go over it with me and when he did so the advice he gave me was very different from what I had been doing. I did not sow any more clover without first using limestone. About this time Professor Case came to our county and he sat down with one of these little account books and he asked questions and made a few additions, and in an hour or so he gave me more real information about that farm than I had learned in working it two years. He showed me in the first place that we were spending too much money in operating the farm as it lay. He showed me also that our horse and man labor was too high, | as it was bound to be with the soil condition, the poor soil and the vines; </seg>
            <seg id="p142">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE and he showed me that I needed a better cropping: system; and so among Professor Case, Mr. Mosher, and myself, we worked out a crop - ping; system which we have used continuously since that time. Corn, corn, oats, wheat, clover; this divides the horse and man labor over the entire season so we can make efficient use of it and cut down the total cost per acre. Then, too, we started to haul limestone. When we started the farm - ing system we divided the farm into five parts as nearly as we could, and at the same time we worked toward the present arrangement of fields where we have six plots of ground instead of thirteen, ranging frcm 66 acres down to 50 acres each. Then another thing Professor Case showed me with his little ac - count book was that farming is a business. We can call it pretty nearly anything we want to, a profession, a calling, or a mode of living, or whatever else, but it is a business. We can define business as a service performed in the hope of gain with the risk of loss, and I think we have all these elements in farming. This farm if it is to pay must pay a reasonable return to the operator and pay a five per cent return on all invested capital, fixed and working. We put into operation rotation, corn, corn, oats, wheat and clover, and used limestone because the ground was sour. Rotation and Yields In 1916 upon 54 acres we raised 32 bushels of corn to the acre. The next year I seeded oats there and in the fall plowed it in for wheat and then put on about three tons of limestone per acre and as I worked the ground for wheat the limestone was worked into the soil and in the spring I sowed white blossom sweet clover.' It came along well and made a good crop and I left that the following year. I wanted to get some use out of the sweet clover;' I didn't know a whole lot about sweet clover. We got a couple of carloads of steers and put on it, but we didn't put them on early enough/ It grew very large, eight feet high, and it was not good feed, so the steers made paths through the clover, and you could come up within two feet of a steer on horseback and not see him. We tried to plow that in the fall after the stems began to die and thought it would plow easy then, but there was such an immense amount of growtli there the stems broke loose and the tractor wheels broke them up and it was impossible to go over it with the plow, so we burned the sweet clover. The next year we put this ground in corn and it yielded 69 bushels to the acre as a result of the sweet clover and limestone. The two pre - ceding corn crops on this land had yielded only 32 and 31 bushels to the acre. </seg>
            <seg id="p143">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION We thought the sweet clover would come up in the oats and make trouble. We did wear out several sickles cutting- out the large clover, but in spite of that our oats yielded 70' bushels in that field. We sowed Mammoth clover in one field and had an enormous growth. We plowed it up and put in corn the two years following and neither crop made 50 bushels. I think the ground was fully as good as the other field. By putting in Mammoth clover instead of sweet clover we must have cut the yield at least 10 bushels to the acre. The second time over for the complete rotation was last year, and the corn made a little over 60 bushels to the acre. In 1925 we had 183 acres in corn and the corn yielded 72 bushels to the acre from the entire 183 acres. The cost for soil improvement up to this time, including limestone and clover seed amounted to $2,197.12. I If we would take the highest yield of corn we had up to that; time under ! the old system, 44 bushels, and deduct it from the 72 bushels, and multi - ply it by 60, the fall price of the crop that year, it would give us enough to pay this entire bill and pay the dues to the farm management organi - | zation for 20 or 25 years on the increased value of our corn crop for one year. Mr. Case told you about the three-year farm management work that we are doing in Illinois. Our farm is below average efficiency in one thing and that is in the feeding of grain to livestock. Instead of getting a return of $151.00, we got a return of $140.00 for these |three years from each $100 of feed fed to livestock. We fed a lot of grain, $15 worth per acre. We fed it to hogs almost entirely. A person having a chart like this can take a pencil and figure during the long winter evenings. Suppose we imagine a farm. If in each efficiency factor our farm equalled the record of the best five farms, our farm income would have been increased $7,051 per year. A very nice income, jand I think we could then almost call it a high profit farm. I doubt if we have many high profit farms at this time. Our average income was- 6.31 per cent on all invested capital after paying the operator $720 a year, which is not a very munificent salary. One of the most encouraging things about agriculture to my mind is that our state universities are working together and working with our farm people and farm organizations. If the problem is as I see it we need complete co-operation before we can solve this problem. How can we increase production per worker on the farm 100 per cent? That we must do before we can earn 5 per cent on the invested capital and give the operator a fair return on his labor and management QUESTION: How did you get rid of the vines? MR. PARKE: The sweet clover itself didn't do it, but we plowed early for wheat, and in August if necessary, and sometimes we plowed ; the ground when it was very dry and broke it up in large chunks. We </seg>
            <seg id="p144">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE found it was expensive plowing, but in the fall we worked the ground for wheat and that discouraged the vines some more, and in the spring they came up and found the wheat ahead of them, and we found they didn't thrive in the wheat. We put in corn and it grew right along after the soil treatment and then we could go ahead and get in the field to cultivate and get ahead of the vines. QUESTION: What was the condition of the ground after using sweet clover? . / MR. PARKE: It was in prime condition. It didn't bake and it didn't crack. In our corn husking we used a two-row machine this year. We do not consider it perfect, but we do consider it an improvement over hand husking. We picked up about three bushels to the acre after the machine. We husked on an average for the whole season 70 bushels an hour. We had the two-row New Idea. Until you start husking by machine you don't realize the different condition of the stalks- at differ - ent times of day and on different days. For the most part it husked our corn much cleaner than it had ever been husked before. QUESTION: What was the cost of picking the corn? MR. PARKE: Allowing one dollar per hour depreciation on the machine and one dollar per hour depreciation on the tractor and includ - ing fuel, oil and labor, but not figuring the horses and wagons, it was 4 cents per bushel. QUESTION: How much lime was used per acre in Illinois, and where was it secured? MR. PARKE: About three tons and it was secured from quarries near Joliet. The stone cost from 90 cents to about $1.70 delivered. We can test the soil now and tell about what we need, but we did not know this when we first began using the lime. ' . </seg>
            <seg id="p145">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION u-i, / ALFALFA SEED FOR 1928 P. H. STEWART During the past six or seven years much alfalfa seed lacking: in hardness has been sown by Nebraska farmers. That this is true is proven by several lines of evidence. In the first place many of our seedsmen report that when Argentine alfalfa seed was first imported into the United States in considerable quanti - \' ' ■ ■ jj ties, amounting in one year to nearly eight B 1 million pounds, and before information was at I B^^^^ hand which proved it unhardy under Nebraska I ' I conditions, much of it was sold in this state. ■ &amp;r&lt; J '"" I Secondly, those familiar with the movement i /-•jhM I ° f a ' falfa secc^ produced in the United States I lE^B /Q I know t^ iat considerable amounts have moved I ~~ '"W^| j '"to Nebraska from southwestern states such I ■i'SP^^I J as Arizona and New Mexico. Moreover, obser - t BaA / '"' vations of lots of alfalfa offered for sale within I .: I St j tn e state have brought out the fact that alfalfa see( j containing 1 Johnson -grass has been moving through the regular seed channels to an alarm - ing extent Johnson grass, a southern plant, may in most cases be taken as an indication that the alfalfa seed in which it is found had its origin in southern states. On many farms of the state alfalfa fields have killed put under circumstances which would logically lead one to conclude that the seed did not have the hardiness characteristic of that grown under northern conditions. Often two lots of commercial seed sown side by side have shown wide differences in winter hardiness indicating that one of them was of imported or southern in origin. Last spring 25 Nebraska county agents submitted an estimate of the per cent of alfalfa which had killed out in their county during the j 1927-28 winter. These estimates ranged from practically none to as high as 40 per cent in two counties, 25 in a third, and 22 in a fourth, averaging 12 per cent, all counties reporting. In spite of increased jseedings of alfalfa in the state during the past five years, the total acreage has decreased rather than gained, as one would normally expect. The use of unhardy seed is, I believe, the greatest factor in this difficulty of holding satisfactory stands of alfalfa. Alfalfa Acreage in Nebraska Year .

Even more important than quality in seed is the matter of origin in the case of alfalfa. The seedsman or local dealer who cannot tell his customers where the alfalfa seed which he is offering for sale was grown does not deserve the patronage of thinking farmers. Buying without this information is a greater gamble than the proverbial "buying a pig in a poke." Recommended Sources of Alfalfa Seed for Nebraska Before we discuss the matter of how to go about it to secure seed of known origin it might be well to briefly summarize the recommenda - tions as to the sources and varieties of alfalfa seed most likely to be satisfactory for Nebraska. At past meetings of the Nebraska Crop Growers' Association you have been given repoijts on the alfalfa tests at the Nebraska Experiment Station. Briefly these tests indicate that Argentine, Italian, Spanish, and African seed ' is unsatisfactory for Nebraska. ■ As to domestic seed, that grown south of Kansas lias proven un - hardy with Arizona seed showing the greatest winterkilling of that from any source either domestic or imported. Common alfalfa from Nebraska or from states with climatic conditions' at least as severe, has proven satisfactory. Although common alfalfa has not shown quite the hardiness of Grimm and Cossack under our conditions, still for the average farm where the alfalfa is to be left from 4 to 6 years, it should prove satisfactory. Grimm and Cossack are more hardy than common alfalfa, this being commonly demonstrated in more northern latitudes. During the past few years tests of alfalfa seed of different varieties and sources have been conducted on farms in various parts of Nebraska. The results of these tests substantiate the Experiment Station results. The following summary shows the per cent survival of plants during the past two winters in tests conducted in 11 counties. </seg>

Fortunately through the Goodding-Ketcham seed staining act all imported alfalfa seed is now stained according to its apparent value under our conditions, so no farmer need buy such seed unknowingly. There is at the present time considerable Turkestan alfalfa being im - ported, a part of which has already reached the corn belt. The early importations of Turkestan seed were apparently very satisfactory, under Nebraska conditions, some old fields tracing to what is thought to have been Turkestan seed being still in excellent condition in Nebraska. In the eastern states Turkestan seed has not been satisfactory. In recent years seed from Turkestan has shown much variation due probably to ! its having been produced under the widely varying climatic conditions of that region. In purchasing seed which is now being imported one might expect, from the hardiness standpoint, to get both good and poor lots of seed from Turkestan. Buying seed from that source would be taking chances as to where the seed originated. The 1928 Alfalfa Seed Crop The 1928 alfalfa seed crop was short, particularly in the northern states toward which Nebraska must look for her supplies. Taking Kansas and Utah as the southern boundary of what might be called the </seg>
            <seg id="p148">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE northern seed producing states, this area in 1927 produced 30,000,000 pounds of seed as compared to 18,000,000 pounds estimated for 1928. This leaves a deficit for 1928 of some 12,000,000 pounds. Utah and Kansas common alfalfa seed, according to the U. S. Department of Agriculture, are about equal in hardiness. Nebraska common alfalfa and that from the Dakotas appears to be somewhat more hardy than that from Utah and Kansas. It is always a wise precaution in buying alfalfa seed to purchase lots which grew to the north of where it is to be sown. This will assist, on the whole, in getting hardy seed.

Alfalfa seed this year will undoubtedly be high. Growers are being paid as much or more for seed this year than it retailed for a year ago. Seed sold as bargain stuff with the price the main attraction is usually, if not always, far from being a bargain. Farmers will do well to let such offerings alone using good grade seed and economizing if neces - sary by preparing an excellent seed bed and using less seed per acre of the high quality viable seed. Bargain lots are notorious for their con - tent of weed seeds, some of which are often of the worst noxious type. Low germination, other crop seeds, trash, and general poor quality are other common faults of so-called "Bargain" lots of seed. </seg>

Often bargain seed is far from such when (termina - tion, purity, and weed seeds are considered. Buying Alfalfa Seed of Unknown Origin Where one is buying Grimm or Cossack alfalfa, it being desired to get the most seed available, then it is advisable to purchase certified and sealed lots. Practically any seed house can now supply certified Grimm alfalfa which comes in sealed bags carrying the tag of a recog - nized State Crop Improvement Association. Such seed may be pur - chased with confidence that it is true to name and of good quality. So-called "affidavit Grimm" which carries the affidavit of some one, that "he thinks the seed is Grimm," is not a reliable index to go by. Realizing that for the most part common alfalfa is sown on corn belt farms and that the place of origin of such seed is extremely im - portant, the Bureau of Agricultural Economics, through the Feed atid Seed Division, last year started a service with wholesale seedsmen to check the origin of alfalfa seed and to tag lots for these men showing where the seed was produced. This service is called "verification" and the seed which has been checked is called "verified seed." The detail of this work need not be given here, as it is complicated, but let it be said that it is very thorough and one can feel quite con - fident that verified seed offered by seedsmen is as claimed. Many large seedsmen throughout the country are voluntarily co-operating with the </seg>

Verified alfalfa seed should be available from seed dealers this year and will be available if farmers ask for it. The origin of the seed is carried on the tag. Ask for verified seed and help to establish and develop this service which is for the benefit of alfalfa growers. It will solve the problem of how can one be sure of getting alfalfa seed from a certain state. . Verification has nothing to do with variety, quality, or germination, but deals only with origin. Where one wants seed of a certain variety such as Grimm, then certified seed should be asked for. However, most corn belt farmers are satisfied with north - ern common alfalfa and by buying such seed under the verification system they are protected in getting that for which they pay. THE LATEST DEVELOPMENTS OF SEED CORN TREATMENTS T. A. KIES.SELBACH The Nebraska Agricultural College has now completed 4 years of investigation regarding the use of mercuric disinfectants recommended by their manufacturers for the universal treatment of seed corn before planting. This investigation substantiates the claims that these com - pounds disinfect against certain seed-borne or- Hganisms which cause seedling diseases of corn. It. does not, however, confirm the point of view that all seed corn is in need of such disinfec - tion or is otherwise appreciably benefited thereby. Averaging together all of the results obtained during these last 4 years from hun - dreds of plats planted to planter-box seed that was obtained from many different farmers in various parts of eastern Nebraska, it is found that the treated seed has yielded an average of 40.51 bushels and the untreated seed 40.53 bushels per acre. For practical purposes these yields may be regarded as equal. The field t. A. Kiuseibaeh ■ stands secured from the same tests average 81.3 per cent for the treated seed and 81.4 for the untreated seed, which again indicates no advantage for the treatment. It is believed that the seed included in the above tests is fairly representative of Nebraska seed as a whole. While there may be occasional growers in this state whose seed would be materially benefited by treatment, they seem to be few and far between. A great misunderstanding has developed among corn growers as to the object of seed treatment and in just what, manner the crop might be </seg>
            <seg id="p151">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION benefited. The uncertainties and misunderstandings have led to far more common usage than would otherwise have been the case. Why should one hesitate with seed treatment if it will prevent smut, ear rot, barrenness, breaking and lodging of the stalks, falling of the ears, and worm or rodent damage after planting, and at the same time hasten maturity and improve grain quality? In the Nebraska tests it has done none of these things with any of the three different grades of seed tested, namely: (1) Nearly disease-free seed; (2) farm selected "planter-box" seed; and (3) diplodia infected seed. Treatment has, however, reduced the severity of certain seedling diseases in cases of j seed especially selected for high infection with "Dry Rot" organisms. These seedling diseases are confined to the germinating seed and to early seedling development. An extreme effect of such seedling disease is to kill the young plant and thereby reduce the field stand secured. Seed that is so heavily infected with these seedling diseases as to bring about such stand reductions is improved by disinfection. The damage done by the seedling diseases as a result of seed infection is largely confined to the stand reduction since the disease is not systemic. In ether words, these disease organisms do not grow up through the stalk from the seed and affect the ear. The stalk and ear may, however, be - come affected from wind-borne spores arising from crop residues of previous years, the same as is the case of the common smut disease. No seed treatment will influence these latter symptoms of disease. The maximum benefit derived in these tests from the treatment of very heavily diplodia-infected seed has been an 18 per cent gain in stand. Even this resulted in very little loss to grain yield because the remaining plants in the thinner stand had greater opportunity for indi - vidual plant development. Averaging 4 treatment tests with this grade of seed during two years the yield was 43.2 bushels per acre without treatment and 44.9 bushels per acre with treatment. It should be borne in mind that viable seed so heavily and yet invisibly infected with dry rot disease as was used in these testa can only very laboriously be picked through germinator tests by skilled workers. Such seed is of great value in studying the nature and control of the seedling diseases, but is far more extreme than any seed ever planted in farm practice. All four of the commercial compounds known by the names of Uspulun, Improved Semesan, Jr., Bayer Dust, and Merko have given very similar results with both badly diseased (diplodia) seed and ordi - nary farm selected seed corn. Coating farm-selected "planter-box" seed at the time of planting with these mercuric " disinfectants as a protection against soil-borne organisms which cause decay, is not warranted under these conditions, according to time-of-planting experiments conducted at the Experiment Station' during the last three years.

It may be concluded that Nebraska grown seed ears, selected in the usual way for their sound and mold-free appearance, are generally not appreciably benefited in production by treatment with these mercuric fungicides. Undoubtedly the most serious menace to seed corn is freezing injury during the fall and winter while the corn contains an excess of moisture. Seed selection against such injury and visible mold and other unsound - ness is always important. Picking of the seed ears by physical examina - tion rather than by individual ear-germinator tests has proved to be satisfactory practical procedure. With this mode of seed selection, proper planter adjustment, favor - able seedbed preparation, and poisoning of ground squirrels, about all that it is possible to do toward securing a stand has been done. Now that we have considered, in a general way, the nature of the seedling diseases of corn and the effect of treatment, a review of representative specific tests with farm selected seed cprn may be of interest. In 1927 "planter-box" seed or seed as picked by farmers for their own planting, was obtained from seventeen corn growers located in fourteen different counties of eastern Nebraska. Each man's corn was tested on the Experiment Station farm by planting both treated and untreated seed, side by side, in three-row plats, at the rate of three seeds per hill. By averaging the results of all of these tests we have the best possible indication as to whether farm" selected seed was bene - fited by treatment. The treated seed averaged 53.9 bushels per acre and the untreated seed 55.0 bushels. The field stand was 85 per cent for the treated and 87 Ms per cent for the untreated. The differences as to lodging, barrenness, diseased ears, and other vegetative characters, were insignificant and the crop grown from both lots of seed was almost identical in all particulars. ' In these tests nine of the samples had been tested with Improved Semesan, Jr., and eight with Bayer Dust. The untreated seed yielded 1.3 bushels more than when treated with Semesan, Jr., and 1 bushel more than when treated with. Bayer Dust. Rather similar results were secured from tests with "planter-box" seed at the Agronomy Farm near Havelock, during the two years 1926 and 1927. Twenty Lancaster County, Nebraska, farmers supplied their home picked seed each year. The average results for the seed secured from all of the farmers are again regarded as the most reliable indica - tion of seed treatment effects. In 1927, which proved to be a favorably </seg>
            <seg id="p153">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION moist year for corn, the seed treated with Uspulun yielded 70.7 bushels per acre compared with 70.2 bushels for the untreated. The field stand secured was 79 per cent for the treated seed and 76 per cent for the un - treated. Averaging: both years, 1926 and 1927, the treated seed yielded 39.2 bushels per acre compared with 39.6 bushels for the untreated seed. The average field stand was 2 per cent better, in this test during the two years for the treated seed. In another test of farm selected "planter-box" seed, extending over a three-year period, 1925-1927, no significant difference in results was obtained. The seed supplied by thirty Lancaster County farmers was mixed together in this case and handled as a single sample. This may be regarded as representative of seed in this county. The sample was divided into four lots which were handled separately. Three were treated with different widely advertised mercuric- compounds, namely, — Uspulun, Bayer Dust, and Semesan, Jr. The fourth was left untreated. Six systematically distributed three-row plats, sixty-four hills long, were planted to each treatment during each season. This may be re - garded as a fairly reliable test. Although the growth and yield varied greatly in the different years, due to climatic differences, there was no material effect from seed treatment in any season. As an average for the three years, the field stands secured from Uspulun, Bayer Dust, Semesan, Jr., and no-treatment, were 77, 76, 75, and 76 per cent, re - spectively. The corresponding yields of shelled corn were 39.4, 39.6, 39.0, and 39.1 bushels per acre. When all treatments are averaged it is found that the yield was reduced 0.3 bushel in 1928; was unaffected in 1926, and was increased 0.8 bushel in 1927. Equal stands were secured as an average for the three years from treated and untreated seed. A co-operative test in 1928 on the farm of Mr. Gilmore at Valley, Nebraska, failed to show any advantage whatever in connection with the treatment of "planter-box" seed collected from a number of eastern Nebraska farmers. The detailed results of those tests will be reported by Mr. Gilmore himself in a following paper. In co-operation with the Agricultural Extension Service, in 1928, a number of farmers were supplied with some one of these prominent mercuric dust seed corn treatment compounds, for trial tests in con - nection with their own corn. In response to a questionnaire, thirteen men reported their conclusions after the crop was harvested. All indi - cated that they could observe no improvement in stand or yield, and no efiect upon the speed of germination, the rate of plant growth, or the percentage of smutty plants, lodged plants, and diseased or rotted ears. In order to determine whether seed corn is materially more bene - fited by treatment at one time of planting than another, both treated and untreated seed of two standard eastern Nebraska varieties have </seg>
            <seg id="p154">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE been planted at six different dates, during each of three years, 1926 - 1928. The seed was treated with Uspulun in 1926 and 1927, and with Bayer Pust in 1928. The planting: dates were April 25, May 5, May 15, May 25, June 5, and June 15. Averaging both varieties for the three-year period, the maximum deviation in stand between treated and untreated seed at any one plant - ing: date was 2 per cent with a grand average of 1 per cent in favor of treatment. Treated seed gave a better stand on three dates, a reduced stand on two dates, and had no effect on one date. Averaging both varieties for the three years, the maximum devia - tion in yield between treated and untreated seed at any one planting date was 1.2 bushels with a grand average for all dates of 0.2 bushels in favor of the untreated seed. The treated seed averaged the highest yield on the fourth and sixth planting dates and least on the other four planting dates. There was no consistent tendency for the early planting to be bene - fited most by treatment. It does not appear from any of the Nebraska results that these mercuric compounds serve beneficially as a protection of the seed after planting against soil borne organisms under such con - ditions as prevailed in these experiments. United States Department of Agriculture workers in Illinois and agricultural experiment station workers in Iowa have concluded from tests in their respective states that seed corn treatment is decidedly profitable to the corn grower. It may be that a difference in climatic and soil conditions would be a plausible explanation for the difference in results. Agricultural experiment station workers in many other states have indicated either through publication or correspondence that seed corn treatment is not recommended under their conditions. It should be borne in mind that we have an entirely different propo - sition in connection with seed corn treatment than in the case of seed treatment of wheat for stinking smut. The use of recognized disin - fectants on small grain seed subject to smut is fully endorsed by the Nebraska Agricultural College. On the other hand, neither this institu - tion nor any of its substations either use or recommend any of the seed corn treatments on the market. This is for the reason that farm selected seed corn has not been materially benefited, in this state, through their use.

            <seg id="p155">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION SEED CORN TREATMENT ON MY FARM MR JOHN GILMORE, Valley, Nebraska Ladies and Gentlemen: A year ago when I was here at these meet - ings every time I went out of that door I was handed a little pamphlet. I got a pocket full during the various sessions', all telling of treatments for seed corn. The circular contained a great number of claims, I found in looking them over, and in order to determine whether or not seed corn treatment would be of value on my own farm, I arranged through the co-operation of our county agent and the agronomy department of the College, for experiments with these various treatments. Mr. P. H. Stewart and Mr. D. L. Gross, extension agronomists, co-operated in putting in and in checking results in this test in as careful a way as possible and we feel that the results are reliable. Our idea in carrying on this work. was to see whether or not the treatments proved beneficial under ideal corn growing conditions in western Douglas county where 70 to 90 bushel yields are not uncommon. On my land it is not far to the water table and it was felt that this rich moist soil was favorable to the development of ear, stalk, and root rots, if such exist as a serious problem in Nebraska. I will not take any more time tciay than to just ask you to go over with me the figures and results as we determined them on my farm. Just a word as to the technique. This field was composed of rows 52 rods in length. We planted two iws of untreated corn and the next two rows of treated corn of the same lot of seed and so on across the field, using the different treatments, Bayer Dust, Merko, and Semesan, Jr. The various plats were again planted, making them in duplicate. The seed corn was procured from several different farms in eastern Nebraska from planter-box seed which, they were using. It was drilled with a regular corn planter, which I use for ordinary field work. As soon as the corn was up well, counts were made of the stand. The two men making the counts took alternate rows without having any information as to what the treatment of any particular plot was. In this way each person made counts on a part of each 2-row plat This was to avoid any variation due to individuals. The following table shows the results secured in making the count on June 5. </seg>

In view of the fact that practical, cheap and effective seed treatments are available, this high loss is unnecessary. Losses from smut in grain are due to a reduction in the yield per acre, and, in the I . case of wheat, to the lowering of the grade, r " " ~~ ™ "* ~ ~~ ■■ quality, and market value of the crop. •_.-- 1 What Is Smut?

Gross tory w hich must.be understood in order to de - velop successful methods of seed treatment for its control. Types of Smut There are three general types of smut, based on the .manner in which, they infect the plant. These may be described as follows: Seed Infection. In this type of smut the spores adhere to the sur - face of the seed, germinate when the seed does and infect the young seedling. Covered smut of wheat, the smuts of oats, covered smut of barley and sorghum smut are of this type. Flower Infection. Smuts of this type infect the flowers of the plant on which they lodge. The spores fall on the open flowers at I pollination time, and grow into the developing seed. The infected seed appears normal, but when it is planted and germinates, the fungus also begins to develop and grows up within the plant, causing a black smutty mass in place of the head of grain. Loose smut of wheat and barley are of this type. Soil Infection. - The spores of this kind of smut live from one season to another in the field. They blow about, falling on the host plant, where they germinate and infect the tissues. Corn smut is of this type. Since the spores are not carried on the seed, seed disinfection is of no value. Injury to the corn plants by hail or in other ways, allows the spores to get a foothold easier, although this is not essential for infec - ; lion. </seg>
            <seg id="p160">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Wheat Smuts There are two kinds of smut which attack wheat; the covered, also known as bunt or stinking smut, and the loose smut.

It causes large yearly losses to wheat growers, by reducing ?x'} ■ V ' iv \ ~\ "■ / ' A head of wheat infected with ' stinking smut. yields and lowering the quality and grade of the crop. In heads infected with covered smut the kernels are filled with a mass of black, stinking spores. The yield is reduced about in proportion to the per cent of </seg>
            <seg id="p161">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION heads which are smutted in the field. If a field count shows that, on the average 10 per cent of the heads are smutty, the reduction in yield per acre will he about 10 per cent. In addition to the loss in yield, the crop which is smutty brings from 2 to 15 cents less per bushel than similar smut free wheat. Losses Due to Covered Smut Table 1 shows the per cent of carloads of wheat on the Omaha market which were graded smutty during recent years. ■ Table 1. Per Cent of Cars of Wheat Graded Smutty on Omaha Grain Market* Per Cent of Can Year .

Of this, 20,000,000 bushels graded smutty, selling at a price reduction estimated at 3 cents per bushel. This would mean a loss of $600,000. Probably : an equal loss, if not a still greater one, was caused by the reduction in yields. This would make well over a million dollar loss to the 55,000 wheat growers in Nebraska for the covered smut loss in wheat in 1928. In 1925 and 1926 the loss is estimated at more than twice this amount, , as the per cent of smutty wheat on the market was much higher and the wheat was more smutty, causing a greater price reduction per bushel. Some farmers have lost as much as one-half of their crop from covered smut and in addition they have been unable to sell at a satisfactory price what they did harvest. Badly smutted wheat must be thoroughly washed and scoured before it can be milled. Smut Control a Community Problem Covered smut is carried in smut balls or as spores on the wheat kernels. A smutted kernel may contain from 1,000,000 to 4,000,000 smut spores. Farmers who have smut free wheat may have their crop in - fected by community threshing machines. In marketing wheat, during the rush seasons, due to the inability of elevator operators to bin grain of different grades separately, smutty wheat may be mixed with good wheat, thereby lowering the grade and price of the good wheat Farmers * Wheat showing more than 10 smut balls per 250 Brains of wheat or which has an un - mistakable odor of smut is graded smutty under Federal Grain grading regulations. </seg>
            <seg id="p162">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE sometimes feel that since all wheat brings the same price at country elevators, it is not worth while to give consideration to smut in the grain. Where elevator prices remain the same for all wheat, the operator pays a relatively lower price to everyone, thereby penalizing the man with good wheat to make up for the loss on the poor grain. The good farmer is charged for the carelessness of his neighbor. Smut control in wheat is a community problem. Local campaigns to treat all seed wheat for smut are well worth while. How Covered Smut Lives When infected seed is planted the smut spores germinate, forming a tube-like growth which is capable of entering the young wheat seed - lings at any time before they reach the surface of the soil. The smut plant then develops within the wheat plant, the infection not becoming apparent until just before the wheat ripens. Heads of wheat which are smutty have a bluish gray appearance, the beards tend to spread out and when ripe the smutted heads show the diseased kernels bulging out from the chaff. Usually the straw of smutted heads is shorter than that of healthy plants. If the smutted heads are mashed they will be found to contain a black, foul smelling substance which consists of the smut spores or "seed". In threshing, these spores adhere to healthy wheat kernels and when this seed is planted the life history of the smut is again repeated. There is some evidence that smut spores, particu - larly those in unbroken smut balls, may live in the soil for some time. Under Nebraska conditions covered smut spores probably do not live over from year to year in the field, although they may retain their vitality in stored wheat for some time. • . • •■' -' ■■'.■■.■■••■ Conditions Affecting Smut Infection Sometimes wheat growers find that early sown fall wheat produces a smut free crop, while later sown seed from the same bin produces a crop with considerable smut in it. Wheat planted in standing corn sometimes develops considerable smut, while the same kind of seed sown on summer fallow is free of smut. This behavior is due to the influence of temperature and soil moisture on smut development. Wheat germinates most rapidly when soil temperatures range from about 70 degrees to 85 degrees F. The spores of covered smut, however, prefer cooler temperatures of 48 degrees to 60 degrees F., and in fact lie dormant in the soil if temperatures are high. Since covered smut spores can infect the wheat plants only when the wheat is in the very early seedling stage, the early seeded wheat may germinate and come up rapidly at temperatures too warm for the. germination of the smut </seg>

Early seeded wheat is therefore less likely to be smutty than late seeded wheat, even though the seed be the same. It will thus be seen how weather, although it cannot cause smut, may have much to do with its development if smut infected seed is sown. Seed Treatments to Avoid Covered Smut Since no one can predict what moisture and temperature conditions will be at seeding time and since very early seeding may be inadvisable on account of Hessian .fly, or for other reasons, the best way to avoid smut is to treat the seed properly. The two materials now most com - monly. recommended are copper carbonate and formaldehyde. While either of these materials is satisfactory if properly used, the use of copper carbonate dust is usually to be preferred for the following reasons: Advantages of Copper Carbonate It does not injure the germination or cause" the seed to swell; thus simplifying the problem of getting satisfactory stands. Formaldehyde </seg>
            <seg id="p164">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE sometimes injures the germination due to careless treating or due to planting the damp seed in dry soil, It is impossible to injure seed wheat by using too much copper carbonate dust, although an excess of powder may injure the drill. Seed may be treated with copper carbonate at any time and stored without injury. Formaldehyde treated seed should be sown promptly. The copper carbonate dust treatment is cheap and can be applied rapidly with simple inexpensive equipment. How to Use Copper Carbonate The use of copper carbonate dust consists of thoroughly dusting from 2 to 3 ounces of the material over each bushel of grain. The effectiveness of the treatment depends upon the thoroughness of the dusting. Commercial machines particularly adapted for the use of extensive wheat growers and by mills and elevators are available for this purpose. Farmers with small acreages can make a very satisfac - tory seed treater from an ordinary 30 to 50 gallon steel barrel mounted diagonally on a shaft and equipped with a door at one end. By means of such a treater two men can treat from 20 to 30 bushels per hour. If hand power is used to operate the barrel mixer, it has been found best to treat but one-half bushel of wheat at a time, giving the barrel 20 to 30 revolutions for each operation. With one bushel of grain in the barrel it requires almost three times as much turning to secure good mixing and the barrel turns very much harder. A large tablespoon heaping full holds about an ounce of copper carbonate powder. An ordinary fruit jar lid level full holds slightly more than an ounce. These are handy measures to use. Copper carbonate comes in concentrated (50 per cent) and in dilute (20 per cent) forms. The dilute form has proved as satisfactory as the stronger materials where properly applied. Since copper carbonate dust may prove nauseating to the person treating the seed, it is wise to work in the open, preferably when a breeze is blowing. A mask or damp cloth worn over the nose may also be worn to avoid annoyance from the dust. Treated seed is regarded as poisonous and should hot be fed or sold to mills or elevators. However, if a few treated grains are accidentally scattered about where chickens get them they will cause no trouble.-. Do not try to treat seed wheat by mixing the powder over the grain in a wagon or drill box. A thorough coating of the seed cannot be accomplished in this manner. It is not wise to use more powder than can be made to stick to the seed, as an excess may cause trouble in drilling. When treated wheat has stood in the drill over night or during wet weather it is a good plan before starting the machine to turn the feed shaft back and forth a few times to loosen it of dust which may have settled about the feed gears. </seg>

Very smutty wheat should not be used for seed. Formaldehyde for Covered Wheat Smut While it is believed that the copper carbonate treatment is prefer - able, some farmers may want to use formaldehyde, particularly those who have had successful experience with it. There is, however, more danger of injury to the germination and the seed cannot be treated in advance and stored without danger of reinfection as is the case where copper carbonate is used. It is usually recommended that one pint of formaldehyde be mixed with 40 gallons of water and this amount be sprinkled ever 40 bushels of grain, which is then covered for several hours with blankets, canvas, or sacks. The grain should then be seeded as soon as it is dry enough to pass through the drill satisfactorily. The rate of seeding should be increased to take care of the swelling of the gram. i . , ~ Loose Smut This smut is ordinarily \ - not serious in wheat in y Nebraska.

Heavy applications of water cause the oats to swell, requiring more care in drying, and they feed through the drill less easily. '■-'". ■ Commercial Dust Products for Oats Dust treatments which are recommended, particularly for oats, have recently been developed and put on the market. There has not yet been sufficient opportunity to test these to determine their effectiveness under field conditions, but reports from several experiment stations indicate favorable results. They are somewhat more expensive than formalde - hyde. They have some advantages over the wet formaldehyde treat - ment especially and some farmers may want to give them a 1 trial. They do not seem to be preferable to the dry formaldehyde treatment for oats from the standpoint of labor or costs. Barley Smuts Barley has two kinds of smut, the loose and covered.

Special instructions are necessary for the proper use of this method. . It is suggested that farmers who are interested in this write the Agricultural College for complete directions. </seg>

There is no really effective method for avoiding corn smut. Crop rotation is of some value. Seed Corn Treatments A number of products have been widely advertised in Nebraska for the treatment of seed corn to control a number of diseases. Careful tests at the Nebraska Experiment Station and co-operative tests out in the state fail to show any benefit from the use of these materials on reasonably well selected seed corn. There has been no effect on germina - tion, speed of growth, barren stalks, per cent of moldy ears or yield per acre under Nebraska conditions. I PRESIDENT MAGEE: When I was riding across Nebraska some four or five years ago, I stopped at the town of Lexington. I was standing around the postoffice in the evening, and was talking to a man who said, "You are a farmer, aren't you?" and I said, "Yes." He said, "Come over and meet our county agent; he is the best county agent in Nebraska." And I will now introduce to you that county agent. SMUT TREATMENT RESULTS IN BUFFALO COUNTY MR. A. R. HECHT, of Kearney The farmers in Buffalo county found that it paid them well to treat their oats for smut this past year. We have the records from three farms where they treated their oats against smut compared with the untreated portion of the field, so as to get a very close check as to whether it paid them or not. These three men used the formaldehyde method as described by Mr. Gross, using a pint of formaldehyde to a pint of water applied by one of the ordinary spray guns like you use for shoo-fly on your cows. This spray is applied as you shovel the grain from the bin into the wagon, putting about three strokes of the sprayer to a s shovelful of oats. After the required amount of oats was in the wagon they were covered over with carpet, canvas, or burlap, or what - ever, was at hand; left for about four or five hours or overnight. We also treated our barley with this same solution. In each case we sowed </seg>
            <seg id="p170">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE some untreated oats to use as a check. In July just before harvest we made a close count on these three farms, of the number, of smutty heads in the treated and untreated oats. We found, in the treated part of the field, that not even one per cent of smut could be found, but in the un - treated part the average of the three fields showed 13 per cent of heads smutty. I thought that was alarming. Surely, it seemed to me, these three men had the largest amount of oats smut in the county. We be - gan counting the smut in other fields, and to our surprise we found that 13 per cent was about the average for the entire county. So it must be that oat smut is increasing, as Mr. Gross stated. It took these men on an average about thirty minutes of time for an extra man and which amounted to about 35 cents. On the average they received for that extra labor and about 80 cents for material, an additional 150 bushels of oats or, reduced to cash, about $60.00. My understanding of oat production is that it is not very profitable at the very best and surely we can't afford to lose that $60.00 on the average farm. We found in this instance that the treatment not only controlled smut in the oats, but controlled smut in the volunteer barley in the oats, too, as Mr. Gross has said. That is not the barley treatment we recommend in all instances, but that is what we found on these three farms. These farms were scattered in different parts of the county and are quite representative of the entire county. It would seem that with the easy method and almost perfect way of controlling oat smut there would be no reason why every man, if he is going to plant oats at all, should not treat all of his seed before planting. These farmers did not fan the seed' oats at all, just merely shoveled it from-- the bin into the wagon and from the wagon into the drill. I think it is about time we started a real campaign in Nebraska to encourage the people to treat their oats for smut. PRESIDENT MAGEE: We all know the College of Agriculture has branches out in the state and we are interested in- what is going on at these other stations, because that is of particular interest to the men in that community. I just said to Mr. Zook of the North Platte station, "How shall I introduce you?" He said, "My name begins with Z and I am the last man on the program, and you can introduce me that way." So I will now introduce a 1 man who will speak on the subject "Should Nebraska Grow More Barley?" .' • . </seg>

ZOOK North Platte Station The debatability of this subject is indicated by the fact that it is stated in the form of a question, Should Nebraska Grow More Barley? The most of what I will have to say is on the affirmative side. I believe that Nebraska should grow more barley and .: " ■! wish to place before you some of the reasons 1 for this conclusion. I First, however, let me confess that there — — J are some things about barley that I do not like. *^^B J In common with most of those who have har - -,Si , H vested barley by the binder method, I am [&gt; «S I haunted by two memories. The physical irrita - kj^ri||fl I tion o:f its beards and the mental irritation of operating a binder in a short crop which hangs |^%fl j over the sickle bar and refuses to be tied into Affl- j decent bundles. Then, I do not like barley — JBH^^^B bread. Of all the war substitutes for wheat bread, the most dismal, indigestible failure with L. L. Zook which I had any experience was the so-called bread made from barley. Barley is a pugnacious thing with its worst side out. It is undesirable even for stock feed until subdued by grinding or soaking. With these scores against the crop, it is a little difficult to come out as a champion for it and give it a fair deal. It does, however, have some qualities which should be given consideration. In an attempt to discover the present status of barley and its im - portance in comparison with other crops, we have studied the State and Federal crop statistics covering the 10-year period from 1918 to 1927, inclusive. Table 1. shows- for the principal crops, the average number of acres grown, the average yield per acre, the December 1 farm price per bushel and value per acre of the principal annual crops represented in Nebraska's cropping systems. </seg>

Wheat, about 90 per cent of which is of winter varieties, occupies second place with about 40 per cent of the corn acreage. Oats is in third place with about two-thirds of the wheat acreage. Barley and rye drop off sharply with a combined acreage of only about one-fifth of that of oats. Barley in comparison with the other crops has about one acre for 32 of corn, 14 of wheat and 10 of cats, and is below rye by thirty-two thousand acres for the ten-year period. " , Present conditions do not justify the farming of more acres in the state. About all of the land which can be profitably farmed is under cultivation. The problem then of increasing the acreage of any crop is one of substitution. More acres of barley means the growing of fewer acres of some other crop or crops. Let us compare barley with the several other crops in turn to determine at what place, if any, it may profitably be substituted. Two of the crops listed, namely, corn and wheat, have a higher per acre value than barley. Barley vs. Wheat The highest per acre value of any of the crops shown is that of wheat. Its average value of $18.83 per acre for the 10-year period is $4.53 above 'that of barley. As the cost of production of wheat and barley are about the same, it is fair to assume that the difference in gross value represents a similar difference in profit. There seem? to be little reason, then, considering the state, as a whole, to advocate the substitution of barley for any of the acreage usually seeded to winter wheat. Barley is, however, among the most important emergency crops for reseeding areas of winter wheat abandoned on account of winter killing. ' . Barley vs. Corn Next to wheat, corn shows the highest per acre value of the crops shown on the table. It is somewhat more difficult to compare corn with </seg>
            <seg id="p173">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION the grain crops than it is to make comparisons between the various cereals. This is because in a state with the soil and climatic variations as we find them in Nebraska, some sections are more favorable to corn than small grain production, and in other sections, small grains are more successfully grown than corn. Also, the methods of handling the two crops vary so widely that costs of production may be very unequal. Gross value per acre may have but little relation to profit, and we would be on very unsafe ground in advocating the growing of less corn and more wheat because the per acre value of wheat is higher than that of corn. A study of all the factors involved would probably indicate that it would be an advantage to grow more rather than less corn. If there is uncertainty about replacing any of the corn acreage with wheat which is above corn in per acre value, there would be even less reason for replacing corn with barley which is below corn in per acre value. There is, however, another factor, which, in some cases, may be worthy of consideration. This is the matter of stabalizing yields of feed crops, especially in those sections where low yields or failures, due to drouth, are of frequent occurrence. A diversity of crops is often advocated for these sections, for the reason that drouth periods are erratic in occurrence and variable in duration. The chief moisture needs of barley and corn occur at different seasons. When both are grown, there is a greater chance that one or the other will escape drouth injury than where one alone is grown. The difficulty is that there is no way of keeping the rule from working both ways. While running the crops in relays increases the chances of one or the other crops escaping in - jury, it at the same time increases the chances of one or the other being overtaken by a drouth. That is,' while the chances of serious injury or complete failure in any one year are somewhat reduced, the total effect over a period of years is neutral. In the most favorable years both crops will be injured, and produce poor yields. In other years, one may go up and the other down, but the departures in one direction will about offset those in the other. This is illustrated by the behavior of the corn and barley yields at the North Platte Station. The corn yields for 22 years from one of the dry land crop rotation fields are shown by the solid line in Figure 1. The yields are arranged in descending order and represent a range from 47 bushels per acre to complete failure. Barley yields for the corres - ponding years are represented by the broken line. During the 22-year period there were 6 times when the differences between the yields of corn and barley were less than five bushels per acre; 9 times when barley outyielded corn by more than five bushels per acre; and 7 times when the yield of barley was more than five bushels less than that of corn. - Since average yields are not materially effected by substituting barley for a part of the corn acreage, there is little choice between this </seg>

North Platte. Nebraska. 1907 to 1928, inclusive. Barley vs. Rye Of the crops listed on Chart 1, the two having lower value per acre values than barley are rye and oats. Rye with an average value of ' $12.00 per acre for the 10-year period, is $2.30 below the per acre value of barley. Its yield both in bushels and pounds per acre is below that of any other crop. We are, however, placing rye under a handicap in making these comparisons. Rye, in Nebraska, is grown but little in competition with " other cereals. It is grown chiefly in the sand hills where, in rotation with corn, it serves to check soil blowing, furnishes pasture and pro - duces fair yields of grain. For these purposes it has no equal and any attempt to replace it with barley or any of the other cereals would be disappointing. </seg>
            <seg id="p177">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION Barley vs. Oats Except for oats we have exhausted the list of crop comparisons without finding a place of much promise for the substitution of barley. Oats has the lowest per acre value of the crops listed on Chart 1. On the basis of the prices and yields given its value was only 60 per cent of that of wheat and 79 per cent of that of barley. In spite of its low value per acre in comparison with the other crops, its acreage- is very high, being about two-thirds of that of wheat and ten times that of barley. There are several factors which contribute to the large acreage of oats. First, in those sections of the state where winter wheat and corn are both important crops, it is desirable to grow these crops in rotation. Corn cannot be removed in time for fall seeding of wheat. Seeding between the corn rows is tedious and often hampered by lodged corn and late weeds. On this account, an intermediate spring grain crop is frequently used in changing from corn to wheat. Oats is the crop most commonly used for this purpose, and while it is realized that its per acre value is low in comparison with the other crops, this is to some extent made up by the advantages of the rotation. Also, in sections as in northeast Nebraska, where corn is the lead - ing crop and wheat relatively unsuccessful, oats is extensively used in two-year rotation with corn. Furthermore, oats is a very popular feed grain and its straw a better feed than that of the other cereals. It responds well to favorable conditions, and where good yields and quality can be produced, it does not compare as ifnf avorably with other crops. As a growing crop it is pleasing to the eye. At harvest and threshing time it is kindly to the touch. All of these factors help to account for the popularity of oats, but they do not, from an economic point of view, justify the large acreage grown. We cannot escape the fact that more unprofitable acres of oats are grown in Nebraska than of all other crops combined. Of the crops which might profitably be substituted for a consider - able part of the oats acreage, barley occupies first rank. It is of equal value with oats as an intermediate crop in rotations, produces more pounds per acre of grain and has less hull than oats. As feed for various kinds of livestock it has a higher value than is popularly appre - ciated. . On the basis of the figures given on Chart 1, some interesting com - parisons can be made between barley and oats. The substitution of barley for oats on one-half of the oats acreage in Nebraska would increase by over three and one-half million dollars the total farm value of the crop produced. </seg>
            <seg id="p178">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE A farmer substituting barley for oats on 50 acres would increase the value of the grain produced by $148.00, which would go a consider - able way toward paying the taxes on a quarter section of land. » Even the farmer who thinks he must have oats for feed can beat the game by growing barley, selling it and buying oats from his neigh - bor. Assuming that his oats yield would equal the state average of 27.4 bushels, and that he could raise on the same land the state average of 24.4 bushels of barley; assuming also that he could sell barley for 58.4 cents and buy oats for 41.3 cents, the average farm values for the past ten years, the money from his acre of barley would purchase not 27.4 bushels, but 34.5 bushels of oats. That is, he would be able to increase his yield, per acre expressed in oats, by 7.1 bushels, or 26 per cent. This would, of course, be absorbed in middlemen's profits if he did not deal with a near neighbor. Barley at the Experiment Stations I The examination thus far of the possibilities of barley as com - pared with other crops has been based directly upon information taken from the crop statistical reports. I wish also to call attention briefly to the results secured at the Experiment Stations. Bulletins 201 and 213 give results with various spring grains, including barley, at the Nebraska Central station at Lincoln, and at the Substation at North Platte. The information presented in Table 2 is taken from these bulletins. Table II. — Comparative Yields of Oats and Barley in Bushels and Pounds Per Acre at the Nebraska Experiment Stations at Lincoln and North Platte. Lincoln North Platte Number of Years 11 17 Bushels of Oats 49.3 27.3 Bushels of Barley 33.4 20.0 Pounds With Hull Oats 1568 874 With Hull Barley 1603 960 Pounds Without Hull Oats 109S 568 Without Hull Barley ..- 1393 7922 At Lincoln for a 11-year period barley outyielded oats, on a hull free basis, by 295 pounds per acre, which is a gain of 27 per cent. At North Platte for a 17-year period barley outyielded oats, on a hull free basis, by 224 pounds per acre, or 39 per cent. </seg>
            <seg id="p179">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION While these results do not show as great differences between oats and barley as are shown by the statistical data of Table 1, the margin in favor of barley is sufficient to justify a much narrower ratio between the acreage relations of the two crops than at present exists. Barley as Feed In the middle west with a variety of other grains at hand, barley has not become a popular feed. While it has less hull and compares favorably with oats in composition, most stockmen prefer oats. One reason for this is that barley grains are hard and require grinding or crushing for satisfactory results. The following statements relative to barley as a feed are taken from the 1927 edition of Feeds and Feeding by Henry and Morrison: "The horses of California are quite generally fed on crushed barley, with wheat, oats, or barley hay for roughage. Crushed or ground barley is even better than oats, pound for pound, for work horses, while whole barley is worth slightly less than whole oats. Barley is the com - mon feed of dairy cows in northern Europe. The Danes sow barley and oats together in the proportion of 1 part barley to 2 of oats, the ground mixed grain from this crop being regarded as the best available feed for dairy cows and other stock At the Wisconsin station ground barley has proved fully equal, pound for pound, to ground corn for dairy cows. As barley contains much less hull than oats, it is a more concentrated grain and better suited for feeding fattening cattle, sheep, and pigs. Fed with legume hay to fattening steers and lambs, barley has given entirely satisfactory results. In Great Britain and northern Europe, barley takes the place of corn for pig feeding, leading all grains in pro - ducing pork of fine quality. In American trials, good northern grown barley, when ground, was worth 5 per cent less than corn for pigs." These statements support the statement already made that barley has a higher feeding value than is generally appreciated in Nebraska. From every point of view, it seems reasonable to conclude that barley could profitably be substituted for oats on a considerable acreage in Nebraska. Improvement in Barley A considerable advance has been made in the improvement of barley in Nebraska and other states in recent years. New varieties and strains have been introduced and developed which are already adding much to the profit of barley growing, in the state. Other strains not yet dis - tributed are giving encouraging results. The first improved varieties to: be certified and .generally distributed were Minnesota 184 and Trebi. These are both six-row bearded types. </seg>

            <seg id="p183">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION "■'■' ' -I' The most recent advance in the struggle with the barley beard has been in the development of the smooth awned or barbless types. We might call this the domestication' of the barley beard. The names of some of these, Comfort, Velvet, Glabron, and Bonami, indicate their domestic qualities. The most promising of the barbless awned types so far extensively tried in the state is Comfort. It has the highest average yield of 16 varieties tested in field plats for four years at the Lincoln station. It has had a high rank during the past two years \n trials at the North Platte station. It has done exceptionally well at the Valentine station and in Extension co-operative trials. It has been distributed over a rather wide area. The 1928 certified seed list includes the names of 39 growers of Comfort barley in 27 counties, with a total of 7925 bushels of seed available. Other varieties of smooth awned barleys are under trial and de - velopment, which may give even better results than Comfort. The future for barley in Nebraska looks hopeful. As the years pass we believe it will increase in importance and encroach more and more on the acreage of oats. REPORT OF THE 1928 CORN YIELD CONTEST P. H.

In 1927, 117 completed; in 1926, 68; in 1925, 87; and in 1924, 39. The dry season in northeastern Nebraska very materially reduced completions, particularly in Custer, Madison, and Burt counties, where, although many entered, none fin - ished up. The 1928 contest was conducted along lines very similar to those followed in previous years. The contest feature was conducted as an agronomy extension project, while the production records were also made use of by the Rural Economics Department. The Nebraska Crop Growers' Association supplied medals for county and sectional winners as has been the practice in the past. Cash prizes of $15, $10, and $5 were also paid by the Nebraska Crop Growers' Association for the three highest ranking men in each section. (6») </seg>

A total of 21 corn fields were sampled in eastern Nebraska, 15 of these being soils of contest fields, while 6 were soils similar to those of contest fields but low in fertility, due to an excess of grain farming. A summary of the organic matter content of the 15 contest fields shows a range in organic matter content from 3.46 per cent up to 5.32 per cent. The poor fields ranged from 3.12 per cent to 3.76 per cent organic matter. In comparing organic matter with yields one has this state - ment: The 15 contest fields averaging 4.10 per cent organic matter yielded 83 bushels per acre in comparison with 6 poor fields which averaged 3.39 per cent organic matter and yielded 25 bushels per acre. An increase of 22 per cent in organic matter in the good soils over the poor ones was associated with a 58 bushel or 200 per cent increase in the yield of corn. . - I . It should be appreciated that there are other factors which de - termine the yield of corn aside from soil fertility. Cass and Douglas counties, from which the soil samples have been taken the past two years, were fortunate to receive a fair amount of rain this season. In </seg>
            <seg id="p188">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE the dry section of the state and during droughty seasons such correla - tions as given above would not hold. On the whole, however, eastern Nebraska has weather which is sufficiently favorable to make it a' profit - able practice to keep soil fertility high through the use of legume crops. Other cultural practices also enter in as co-factors with fertility in de - termining yields. For instance, the field of Nelson Berger at Nehawka, making 102 bushels per acre, showed only .3.54 per cent organic matter, which is only slightly higher than the average of the poor fields. This field, however, in 1927 and 1928 had fewer weeds on it than any other contest fields. It had been handled by Mr. Berger so as to develop the maximum amount of nitrates and to get the greatest- good from those which became available in the soil. Legume Crops and Yields As has been shown in the past contests, a close correlation has been apparent in regard to the number of years since 'the land was seeded down and the yield of corn. This is shown in the following table : Comparison of 5 High and 5 Low Men in Eastern Region. 1928.

This is indicated by the figures showing the number of years since contest fields were in legumes in central Nebraska. These are as follows. 1924, 18.5 years; 1925, 26 years; 1926, 21 years; 1927, 14 years; and 1928, 18.6 years. The commonly recog - nized danger of overstimulation of the corn plants followed by dry weather is the reason, of course, for avoiding over rich soils for corn except on sub-irrigated fields in that section. </seg>
            <seg id="p189">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION ■ ■ ■! A few contest fields in Clay county were sampled this year in an effort to get some figures on rotations, organic matter of the soil and yields in central Nebraska. The following data were secured: Organic Contest field of- matter Yield History content Albert Glass 3.92 65.6 3rd year alfalfa-had 2 years cane and Kafir. G. H. Paus 2.92 65.4 ■ Blue River bottom, never seeded down. John Fachnitz. . 3.30 53.0 ? Milton Brown 2.42 27.0 Old— rather thin upland. Milton Brown 3.20 39.0 Alfalfa land adjoining above field. Olin Brown 2.98 34.0 Upland — grain farmed. Mr. Glass' alfalfa land had grown two crops of cane, milo, and kafir, which had possibly reduced. the available nitrates considerably, helping to avoid, at least to some extent, the over stimulation and burning com - mon to corn on alfalfa land in south central Nebraska. The two Brown fields are interesting. They are adjoining, in fact both handled as one field, the soil and cultural methods being identical. The alfalfa land corn burned badly, but even at that the corn on the rich soil made a greater yield than that on the thin oil soil. The yields were taken on the slope of a hill where a comparison seemed fair. In 1928 it was particularly noticeable that the eastern Nebraska contest fields were for the most part on legume lands. The 42 fields averaged 5 years since being seeded down and made 73 bushels in yield. The highest yield, 108 bushels per acre, was grown on first year alfalfa land, the next highest yield, on land in alfalfa 4 years ago, and the third on 2-year-old alfalfa land, while the fourth in rank was on land broken out of sod 4 years ago. Stand of Corn and Yield In 1927 an effort was made to get some idea of the optimum stand from the yield standpoint The figures indicated that for the 1927 season a stand of some 8000 plants per acre, or a little less than 2% ■ plants per hill, made the best yields. In 1928 a similar study of stands and yields in Cass and Douglas ■ counties showed that about 9000 stalks per acre, which is about 2V6 stalks per hill, or a plant every 16.5 inches, gave maximum yields on the rich soils of the contest fields. The following table, which may or may not show the general relation of stand to yield, was prepared from the data of 1928: Effect of Stand on Yield, Cass and Douglas Counties — 1928 1. Six fields with 10,000 or more stalks per acre .80 bu. 2. Thirteen fields with less than 10,000 stalks per acre 76 bu. 3. Ten fields with 9,000 or more stalks per acre . .82 bu. 4. Nine fields with less than 9,000 stalks per acre . . .74 bu. Nine thousand stalks per acre places the stalks 16.5 inches apart in the row, or about 2.5 per hill where the rows were 42 inches apart. </seg>

That trend seems to be still under way if the contestants in the contest are a cross section of corn growers.

It is believed that the labor costs as reported by contestants are representative of the area in which these men farm.

W. Burr deal with crop production. Soil maintenance has received entirely too little consideration. When one travels through those sections of the state where soil washing is preva - lent and notes the gullies that have formed and are still forming and the gradual washing away of hillsides, he is brought face to face with the tremendous loss from this source. Probably the loss to Nebraska agriculture by soil washing is greater than from all other sources com - bined. Losses of this kind are less noticeable than ravages of disease or pests merely because they have been more gradual, but a study of the yields obtained in the various fields in this contest reveals in a measure the magnitude of loss through reduced fertility. Not all, by any means, of the reduced fertility has come through washing. There has been a continued reduction through the many years of cropping. </seg>
            <seg id="p199">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION While reduction in the productivity of Nebraska soils has been con - siderable, still Nebraska is far more fortunate than most of the agricul - tural states. At the present time the big problem for eastern Nebraska is maintenance or repletion of the organic content of the soil. During the past ten years considerable work has been done throughout the state with commercial fertilizers. Up to this time they have not proven profitable, but rotation with legumes and the intelligent use of barn - yard manure has proven profitable. This gives Nebraska farmers a distinct advantage over sections of the country where fertilizers are required. In many sections of the east, farmers must spend from $3 to $5, or even more, an acre for commercial fertilizers for their various crops. The need of commercial fertilizers in Nebraska can be delayed by proper rotation and applications of barnyard manure. In this con - nection it is interesting to note that on' the farms of the 10 men recently elected as master farmers, there was an average of 72 acres of legumin - ous crops, largely alfalfa, per farm. This average was considerably increased by the fact that one of these men was an intensive feeder and had a' great deal of his land in alfalfa. The whole problem of soil fertility and good yields in eastern Nebraska was the one outstanding thing in my mind toward which this contest contributes real information which is in line with the experi - mental evidence being obtained. Another thing which struck me in going over the report was the increasing use of big machinery; it is in keeping with the times. The farmer today seems destined to study that question more and more. He must become ever more, efficient, not only in the use of his own time, but in the use of all the equipment that creates his overhead, and one way of holding overhead down is to make each unit hour of man effort cover a greater area and bring in greater returns. I could talk to you for a long time along this line, but I will not do so today because I know that you want to hear from the men who have actually done these things in the field. As is always the case, the world has a lot of respect for a winner; it seems to love those who can suc - cessfully compete. To my mind the winning itself is not so important as for a man to have tried and tried faithfully. I ■ appreciate just as much perhaps the man who comes in second, third, fourth or fifth or on down, if — insofar as it was within his control — he did his best. How - ever, it is human nature to want to win, and the publicity the winning gives serves in a measure as an inspiration for those who enter next year, to try harder to win first place. I am very glad indeed to have this opportunity of presenting the medals to those of the winners who are here. . The Nebraska Crop Growers' Association gives a silver medal to county winners where eight or more men finish the contest. Some winners, unfortunately, are unable to be here this morning. </seg>
            <seg id="p200">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE MR. STEWART: Mr. L. C. Noyes,— the son of one of our master farmers, — was high man in Douglas county, with a yield of 90 bushels per acre. DEAN BURR: Mr. Noyes, it is an especial pleasure to me to pre - sent this medal to you on behalf of the Crop Growers' Association. Knowing your folks, assures me that you are of the kind that strive to win. Knowing: the Douglas county farmers as a whole, I know the com - petition you were up against, and you have won an honor, that is very much worth while. MR. STEWART: G. E. Ackerman, Beaver City, winner in the cen - tral section, with 97.7 bushels per acre, is present. DEAN BURR: Mr. Ackerman, I take a great deal of pleasure in presenting this medal to you for having won the corn yield contest in your section. Having known your section of the state for a long time, the thought that comes to my mind is where did you get water enough to raise 97 bushels of corn per acre? My first position after I left college was at the North Platte Experiment Station, a little farther west than your section. Moisture was our big problem. The soil in the main is wonderfully fertile. But to produce a. yield such as you have done requires not only the moisture and good land, but skill in produc - tion. It is a real achievement and I congratulate you. MR. STEWART: Mr. Schafer, winner in the eastern section of the contest, is present DEAN BURR: Mr. Schafer, in presenting you this medal, from the Nebraska Crop Growers' Association, I believe I can comment to this extent, that yours is the highest recorded yield of corn on 10 acres that has ever been produced in the state of Nebraska, 108 bushels per acre. To be the first to attain this record is certainly an accomplishment. It is a HIGH YIELD. Around four times the average yield of corn for the state. It speaks well for the possibilities of corn production in Ne - braska. I congratulate you on having made such a high average yield. MR. STEWART: The interesting part of the morning program is now to follow, as I am sure you are all anxious to hear from the winners in the 1929 contest. I want first to introduce to you Mr. Otto Schafer of Cass county. He has been in the contest for several years. I think he generally has better fields than he entered, but he has been sort of feeling around with some of his poor fields. This year he settled down to see what he could really do, and he has made the highest yield ever recorded in the 10-acre contest since its initiation five years ago. We will now hear from Mr. Schafer. </seg>
            <seg id="p201">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION HOW I GREW MY 108-BUSHEL YIELD OTTO SCHAFER, Nehawka, Nebraska Three years ago I entered the 10-acre contest through the sugges - tion of our county agent, L. R. Snipes. That year we had a field of 20 acres which had been in sweet clover for a year, having been seeded with oats. The sweet clover was about knee high to a horse when we J ■ ' plowed it under in the spring of the second j 7-V-; 1 year. I planted it to corn about May 20. This , ' . . field had got so it would not produce over 25 P ■ r^ ~ bushels of corn to the acre. That year it made 42 bushels - ** you remember, we had quite a t W dry season during the- summer of 1926. During "*• " le rv vcar °f 1927 that same ground made 40 fe '■■*"9IM v bushels, and this year with plenty of moisture *•'• — fjiW^ '*■ mac * e 50 bushels per acre. -' \^rJf^ T^ 6 sccond year in tho contest ! entered an - \f: 4 iu V ot ' ler 20 acres .°f sweet clover, which was \-f» ' ! \ y. farmed the same as the first. I plowed it with ''••*' - v A a tractor and, the spring being very dry, we otto Schafer 8ot on ' y a^ out 60 P er cent °* a st °nd and a yield of 40 bushels. I think it yielded well for the year we had. This year, 1928, it made 54 bushels. I did not enter either of these fields expecting to win the high yield contest, but just to find out how much the sweet clover would increase the corn yield. This year I told County Agent Snipes we were going to enter 10 acres for the highest yield as it was good ground. This land was broken from prairie sod about fifty years ago and planted to corn and small grain for forty years. It had gotten so it would not produce much. I sowed it to alfalfa about ten years ago. Three years ago there was only about half a stand left, so I disked the ground and sowed it to sweet clover and then pastured it with hogs and cattle. In the fall of 1927 the land was plowed 6 inches deep with a tractor. It was double disked the latter part of April, putting the ground in very good shape. It was drilled with a corn planter equipped with furrow openers leaving about a 4-inch furrow. I used some Reid yellow dent seed of my own raising which had been selected from the. field in the fall. We field - select our seed every year and I think that the few days in the fall that it takes, to do this makes us more money than anything else we can do. If you can't get a good stand, you can't expect a big yield. After this corn was above the furrows it was harrowed twice, which left the ground almost level. It was plowed twice with a one-row culti - vator. Ordinarily we would have used our two-row cultivator, but it was. haid to get through the gates to this particular field. </seg>
            <seg id="p202">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE This corn grew very fast and on July 3rd was badly hurt by a very hard wind. The corn was planted in rows 42 inches apart and with an adjustment for one kernel every 17 inches, although sometimes it dropped two small kernels together. All I can say for this high yield is that we had the moisture when we needed it. I planted good seed, and planted it when corn should be planted. It was kept clean and was on good soil. QUESTION: Was your land free from weeds? MR. SCHAFER: There were very few weeds in it. QUESTION: Have you found anything better than sweet clover to prepare the ground for corn? MR. SCHAFER: I don't know of anything that is so quick. I sow sweet clover in my oats every spring and then plow it under the follow - ing May, and I never lose a crop. I sow about two bushels of oats to the acre, and about fifteen pounds of sweet clover. I have my own way of putting it in. Lots of people say we get sweet clover too deep, but I disk the ground and sow the oats and clover together and never fail to get a good stand of sweet clover. MR. STEWART: Another man from the eastern section who is not a stranger in the Corn Yield Contest won second place in the eastern section this year. We will now hear from him, Mr. Nelson B'erger of Nehawka, Cass County. NELSON BERGER: I don't know as I have anything much to say about raising corn. It seems that if a fellow can't raise a hundred bushel an acre now he can't raise corn very good and hasn't much chance to win first in the contest I have been in this contest the last two or three years and it has got to be a 1 kind of a '^B^M^^te4? 3fl nabit - l preparing my ground this year I l^^jgfijfek. i double-disked the ground good and used a lister. &amp;tp*^^^^mf&amp;'\ Then I used two-row machinery for two times y l|j : \ and the third time over I used a cultivator.

The weather takes care of the crops to a very large </seg>
            <seg id="p203">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION ■ extent, and weather and soil seem to be the two main factors. Prac - tically every farmer gives his crop the best he has to Rive with his knowledge and the time at his disposal. I had this corn on ground that had been. in corn three years and previous to that had been in prairie sod, so I had nothing to do with the building up of the soil. The land was first double-disked. It was plowed in April about six inches deep, with a tractor. A harrow was attached behind the plows. It was then cross-disked and planted. I used furrow openers. Usually the seed corn is picked in the fall before frost. In cultivation, we used our regular hired man with a two-row cultivator, and didn't give it any particular attention. We used the two-row cultivator the first time over and then crossed with a single row machine, cultivating with two-row machinery again the last time over. We didn't give the corn any particular care, it is just part of our regular corn, and it happened to be the best ground and we received what moisture we needed, although the center part of the field was quite low and didn't drain well, so. the corn there was not as good as on the rest of the field. MR. STEWART: We have had several winners from Furnas county. We used to have Furnas county in the western section of the contest, but they usually took all the prizes. This year we put them in the cen - tral section and they again walked off with the first prize. I am going to ask Mr. Ackcrman to tell us briefly how he raised his 97 bushels in that county. j^^^^^^^^=i MR.

Ackcrman work we did on this. After this rain it was two weeks before we could get in the field at all; and by that time the corn was too high to cultivate. MR. STEWART: During recent years we have heard a great deal about the use of waste products from the farm. We now have operating in the United States several factories using to a greater or less extent corn stalks, straw, and other farm products. We are fortunate, this </seg>

Holbrook pushed out of its way in this day of speed by the automobile and the aeroplane. In all of this hustle and bustle, the man en the soil — the farmer — has been tilling the land and disposing of the fruits of his labor in a market under which he had but little control. His product was a seasonal one and that condition made it quite difficult to handle in order that he might realize a reasonable price during the major part of the year. His income depended largely upon the "market" and until very recently all that he received during the year was from, this source. But there has been a change — a very decided change — for the better, for it has been discovered that with these marketable products from the soil there has always been a "waste" which now seems to have a value connected with it. Especially is this the case in the growing and producing of a corn crop. Corn is a very unique member of the plant family, for from the planting of the seed in the | fertile ground through a lapse of about one hundred and twenty days we have a forest that will delight the eyes of most all people. Corn is a most staple product in this vicinity and we are all interested in it, for we are living in the "Corn Belt." In our country there are 100,000,000 acres of it annually and they give to us over 3,000,000,000 bushels of the "nuggets </seg>
            <seg id="p205">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION of gold and silver" regularly.' Besides this "fruit of the soil" we have remaining a possible 200,000,000 tons of corn stalks and about 25,000,000 tons of corn cobs. Increasing the Return Per Bushel For years the farmer's money has come largely from the disposition of the corn, which usually grew at the rate of forty bushels per acre and was marketed at the nominal price of 60 cents per bushel, or $24.00 per acre. Through the possession of cattle, horses, sheep and chickens, together with a close study of the market conditions, the farmer has ■been able, in most cases, to convert this 60-cent corn into other mer - chantable food products selling at a possible 100 per cent above the prevailing price of the raw product. Instead of all of this processing, the raw corn may be sent direct into Cedar Rapids, Clinton, Keokuk and many other cities where there are located large factories, costing millions of dollars which will convert these corn kernels into a possible sixty different products, among which are starch, syrup, oil, oil cake, malt, alcohol, acetone, flour, breakfast foods, face powders, glycerine soap stocks, pastes, dextrines, rubber substitutes, inks, and many other products. These factories will take a possible $2.00 from this bushel of 60-cent corn, but if the same corn should happen to be received in Peoria or Terre Haute, it might, through other factory processes, be - come worth over $4.00. Thus far we have only dealt with corn in the kernel. Corn Stalks and Paper Now we come to the corn stalk and the corn cob, both of which have always been' regarded in most communities as "waste." Has the stalk a value ? Yes and no. Yes, for. ever since we have known it, it has been used to some extent for fodder for the beast. It is regarded as "roughage" for cattle and swine and in many sections of the corn belt an acre of it was rented for the winter season for a' set price of $1.00. In other sections of country cattle and swine have been permitted to roam about over it in hopes that they might find something of use — a possible stray ear of corn here and there — and then when the season was ready for a new tilling, the rake was brought into action and after windrows had been made, a fire was set among them and they were burned. In some other quarters these stalks were made into stover with excellent results. But in all of these many processes but little direct income was the result. Now a change has come for the better, for the trained chemist and engineer, together with other scien - tific workers, have all taken an interest in this lowly (or shall we call it highly) corn stalk and we are now seeing some tangible results. A corn stalk is a form of cellulose and being of that plant construction can be converted into many articles of usefulness. Right now, in </seg>
            <seg id="p206">REF'ORT OK NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Dubuque, Iowa, in the factory of the Maizewood Corn Products . Com - pany, stalks from the adjoining territory are being made into an in - sulating "lumber" of high merit and quality, ranking high in tensile strength and insulating efficiency. In Danville, Illinois, rayon is being made and also paper pulp is manufactured. ' This pulp is sent, or rather has been sent to Kalamazoo, Michigan, where it is made into a high quality of paper suitable for stationery, magazines and even books. - On December 15, 1928, the "Prairie Farmer" of Chicago issued an edition en paper from this pulp. On the next day — the 16th — the "Commercial- News" of Danville issued a 100-page edition' on a similar paper, and during the recent holiday season the Rae D. Henkle Company of 45 Fcurth Avenue, New York City, issued a book entitled "Farm Products in Industry," written by George M. Rommel, formerly of the Department of Agriculture at Washington, D. C, all of the pages of which were made of corn pulp paper. During the first week in January of 1929 the "Nonpareil" of Council Bluffs, Iowa, issued an edition from a similarly made paper. What Are Corn Stalks Worth It is very evident from the preceding that an interest is being taken in the use and conversion of stalks into useful products. All of this naturally leads us to the question of their monetary value. In Illinois the stalks were given to the manufacturer for the husking and gather - ing of the corn, ' which amounted to about $3.00 per acre based on a husking price of 6 cents per bushel. In Iowa the stalks were bought cutright at prices varying from $5.00 to $7.00 per ton of good dry stalks. This year there will be another readjustment of prices, the basis of which has not yet been determined, for as yet no one seems to have placed upon the market a machine suitable for) the gathering of these stalks successfully. At Iowa State College in Ames, the Agricultural Engineering Department has made several machines which have done good work, and at a nominal selling price. But all of these have been for experimental purposes only. Reports show that a possible 3,000 board feet of insulation lumber is to be expected from an acre of gath - ered stalks, and if this commodity continues to sell at from $40.00 to $60.00 per thousand feet there will be a good return probable. As it takes from 80,000 to 120,000 gallons of water to make a ton of some of these products, it is very evident that these factories will have to be located on large streams of water or in localities where shallow wells with large water flows are possible. The United States is the largest user of paper in the world and with the exception of a very small quantity that is made from rags, the balance is made from wood pulp, much of which comes from Canada. Every time a tree is cut down that means an open forest for a period of years and a greater release of the rainfall to the possible flooded </seg>
            <seg id="p207">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION districts in the land on lower levels. Every year we have before us this "forest" coming as regularly as the seasons and if this waste from the fields will be converted into paper we have not only solved in part the inevitable "flood problem," but have made manifest to the world that we are indeed CONSERVATIONISTS in fact and -in deed. Corn Stalks and Insects There is still another aspect to this problem which is worthy of consideration and that is the solution of the insect invasion. It is stated that the corn borer is or can be expected to move westward from its present habitat about twenty-five to thirty miles annually. It has been found in Indiana and is reported to have been found in eastern Illinois. By removing the stalk in its entirety to one of these process factories the ground has been ridden of this pest and the corn belt has been saved. It is said that in the winter wheat sections of the middle west there is a disease known as the winter wheat scab which finds lodging in the corn stalks. If the season is dry this germ will be blown over a large area. By the processing of the stalk in one of these factories this nuisance is overcome and the wheat sections are rid of this danger. Other Uses of Corn Stalks In order that we may get the full benefit of this new campaign in the coming years it is possible that the large manufacturing concerns when properly located will urge the establishment of such small "gath - ering stations" as are deemed advisable all over the corn belt where stalks can be crushed into pulp with only a small amount of needed water and then baled and shipped to the larger plans, as now done in the creamery business and its many cream stations for the gathering of the product so necessary to their business. Recently the linoleum and the refrigerator interests have become exceedingly anxious to learn of these products and their research de - partments are making very exhaustive studies of them with the hopes that they can be successfully used in the output of their factories. Thus far we have referred in the main to the whole stalk, which constitutes 43 per cent of the field. In addition to this we have 2 per cent in the tassel, 36 per cent in the leaves, and 19 per cent in the husk. It is about the latter that we wish to pay especial attention for they have a great value of late. In Akron, Ohio, one of the largest com - panies in the world for the making of hard rubber articles has found that the husk is par excellent when made into buffing wheels for the polishing of their products. Today from corn stalks there is being made cellulose, charcoal, diabetic food, furfural, guncotton, wall board, dynamite absorbent, lino- </seg>
            <seg id="p208">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE lcum, papier mache, mattresses, fodder, viscose, pyroxylin, varnish, paper, packing in war vessels, and many other products. Corn Cobs First the corn, then the stalk, and now we come to. the cob. Has it any use? Yes, and no. Yes, for years in Missouri it has been made into the "Missouri Meerschaum" and its renown in thatl place has. gone to the remotest parts of our land. In some places it has been used as a fuel so as to get rid of ik From the hog or feeding lot it has been taken to the ground to be plowed under, hoping to get rid of it and get it out of sight. But all of this has been changed, for the chemist has taken hold of it and is now making it an object of attraction to industry.. Through the laboratory he is making new discoveries almost weekly and industry is taking advantage of these new revelations through the application of this science. Furfural, adhesives, organic solvents, wood flour, and artificial silk have all been made very easily thus far from cobs. An insulating material known on the market as "Kalkite," com - posed of 19 parts corn cobs, 12 parts gypsum, and 2 parts waste paper, besides a small proportion of chemicals. This combination makes an article that is vermin proof. A concern in Ohio is using ground corn cobs in their electro plating business in the polishing room. Among the many articles that can be made from cobs are acetic acid, acetone, anesthetics, antiseptics, smudge for bee keepers, cellulose, charcoal, cob flour, tar, dyestuffs, furfural, glue, maple flavorings, incense, punk, pitch, xylose, sweeping compounds, motor fuel, hard rubber, substitutes, oxalic acid, linoleum and plastics. The story is now ending. Corn, corn stalks, corn husks and corn cobs have each been mentioned in turn. All excepting the first named have been regarded as waste, but from the preceding remarks it is evi - dent that they have a value not yet determined. From all that we do now know it is very evident that the tiller of the soil in the corn belt will in the near future be assured of a little larger financial return from the land assigned to the production of either corn or wheat. Industry is awakened to the possibilities of those products and they are making thorough investigations as to the results of the laboratories of the chemist. The government has already become allied in this study, for last year they gave $50,000 for assistance in a further study, realiz - ing that there is much good in these wastes. . This year another appro - priation will be made, thus assuring the resident of the corn belt that his interests are being carefully watched with an intelligent care so that he will reap the due reward. In all of this work the institution of learning that I have the pleasure and honor to represent — the Iowa State College at Ames, Iowa — is leading all other laboratories, for they have been thus designated for the time being by those who are interested enough to give of their own funds for this line of study. </seg>
            <seg id="p209">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS 1 ASSOCIATION MR. STEWART: The last number on the program this morning is a cng the line of new machinery. It will be discussed by Professor O. W. Sjogren, who will tell about some of the new machines that have come on the market rather recently. NEW KINDS OF MACHINERY FOR NEBRASKA FARMERS PROF. O. W. SJOGREN I fear I can't entertain you as well as Mr. Holbrook has done, but I will endeavor to tell you or to discuss with you some of the newer ma - chines that have come on to the market in the last few years. As Mr. Holbrook has told you, agriculture is going through changes and we find it necessary to design machinery to keep up with the changes. In many cases the changes bring out the machinery. They work hand in hand. The increasing difficulty to secure competent farm labor or farm help and the relation of the farm population to the city population is bring - ing about great developments in the equipment in the farming industry, and brings about the designing of labor saving machinery in agriculture the same as in other industries. In the automobile industry it is noth - ing unusual for a manufacturer to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars for machinery that will replace eighteen or twenty men, and do the work much more effectively than by hand labor. • The tendency now toward improved machinery and improved methods is to increase the individual efficiency of the farmer, and to increase his individual production, although not necessarily increase the total production of farm products, since we have a surplus now in some lines. But some people who are being replaced by machinery are going to the cities, and that will continue. We hear a great deal about the "Back to the Farm" movement, but probably we will not see any great exodus of people from the city to - the farm, because the labor saving devices and modern equipment will make, that unnecessary. Changes in tillage methods are being, brought about by new ma - chinery. I wish to illustrate this by discussing the methods being used by a certain man across the river in Iowa. He is not the only one who is practicing this scheme, as it is being adopted quite generally. This •man follows the plan of sowing sweet clover into wheat or with oats in the spring, then when he takes the small grain off, the sweet clover grows up to make pasture or a fair hay crop. The next spring he lets the sweet clover grow- until about the time to plant corn, and then with tractors he turns the crop under and puts the- field into corn. Then he goes over it with a weeder and a rotary hoe, and perhaps gives it one or two cultivations and his corn crop is made. He has no weeds because he got ahead of them and kept ahead during the entire time. This matter of weed control is one of the most important things to consider r' our modern equipment. (7). </seg>
            <seg id="p210">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OK AGRICULTURE Rotary Hoe The rotary hoe is not a new tool. We find it was patented many years ago, but it is only in the last two years that it has been widely adopted. It is made of wheels mounted on two straight shafts, the wheels 18 to 20 inches in diameter and 5 to 6 inches apart on the shaft. The shafts are used to stagger the wheels, so there is just half the distance or 2% to 3 inches between the rows that the wheels made.

That is why it can be used for corn; it kills the weeds before they get started. It is light in draft because it is not dragged over the ground like the ordinary harrow, but has a rotary motion. That principle is being utilized in other weed implements, and it may be that in the near future we will have other weed tools made on the rotary motion plan. The rotary hoe seems to be replacing the weeders used in sections to the east of us and to some extent the old harrow for cultivating corn. It is adapted for use principally on surface planted corn, and is not of much use on listed corn except to stir the ridges. It is also used on soy beans and potatoes, and to some extent to break the crust on the wheat fields in the spring. We don't know what the limitations, nor the </seg>
            <seg id="p211">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS" ASSOCIATION • ■ possibilities of the rotary hoe are. It is a new tool, coming in within the last two years and much remains to be learned. One Way Disc I presume most of you have seen a one way disc. It consists of a series of large discs, about 20 inches in diameter, all set to throw the ground the same way. It is drawn through the soil at an angle so as to turn the soil. These discs are placed 6M: inches to 8 inches apart. This is not a new tool, as it was invented many years ago. It is only within the last three or four years that it has grown in popularity in this state. Many of these discs are used in Kansas, the Dakotas, and other wheat gTowing states. It is a cheaper method of seed bed preparation which has come into vogue with the use of the combine and large scale wheat production. They are made in widths of 10 to 8 or 6 feet, and are pulled with a tractor. As compared to a 3 or 4 bottom 14-inch plow, they can cover 50 to 100 per cent more land. If a man covers ,5 acres a day with the ordinary plow he can cover 8 or 10 or more acres a day with the one-way disc. I do not mean to infer that it turns the furrow, it merely' mixes the earth with the stubble and leaves a ragged surface. This is an advantage in the western areas because it prevents the soil from blowing, and catches the snow in the winter-time so it can't blow off the cultivated fields. It does not weigh as much as a plow, and under favorable conditions it will penetrate to a depth of 5 to 7 inches. The advantage of the one-way disc is the rapid preparation and the rough surface of the ground. There are some disadvantages to it; it will not work satisfactorily in sod or on a stony soil. It will not turn the stubble or surface growth completely under. If you want a nice clean job of plowing you can't get it with a one-way disc. Windrow Machine I will not discuss the combine, except to discuss one development that has been brought about, the wind-rower or swather, which is found through the humid regions. The combine has brought up the problem of how to care for the unevenly ripened and wet grain, and the wind - rower has been brought out to solve that difficulty, if possible. It con - sists merely of a header, which cuts off the grain and deposits it on top of the stubble where the air can circulate through it, so it will dry out quite rapidly. The cutting can begin as early or perhaps earlier than with the binder. After a few days of drying, a pick-up attachment on the combine gathers this grain and passes it directly into the thresher. The possibilities of this practice are unknown, but the probability is that it will bring the combine into many areas where they are now thought impracticable. The heads of grain must be deposited by the wind - rower on top of the stubble, and not down in the stubble in contact with the ground. This method is somewhat more expensive than direct com- </seg>
            <seg id="p212">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE bining:. You have to cut the grain and deposit it on the wind-row, then pro down the windrow with the pick-up attachment on the combine. It seems to have great possibilities in the handling of sweet clover, which ripens very unevenly. The combine may also be used more in harvest - ing such crops as kafir, pop corn and possibly even short western Ne - braska corn. Side Delivery Rake The side delivery rake is rather new to many sections of our state. It is used chiefly in connection with the hay-loader. Just what the pos - sibilities of this are we are not prepared to say, but we may expect some new developments in hay-handling machinery. For instance, one might arrange a hay baler which would travel down the windrow, delivering the hay from the windrow in bales. The Furrow Drill I was out through the west end of the state a few weeks ago and upon investigation found a good many farmers were setting the old drills aside and getting furrow drills. The furrow drill by means of discs makes furrows 12 or 14 inches apart and about 3 inches deep. A mound of earth is left between the furrow which will catch the snow and hold it there through the winter, which seems to prevent the winter killing to a great extent. The authorities at the Colorado Experiment Station say that one year with another it will increase the yield of wheat about five bushels per acre. Personally I consider that a little strong, but the indications out there seem to bear out this claim. Corn Picking Machines The corn picker I need not discuss except to say that there seems to be a great demand growing up for a two-row corn picker. Perhaps the development of methods of utilizing corn stalks will bring about a different type of machine, possibly following the combine design, so one can drive down a row of corn and harvest the entire plant and separate the various parts as desired. We will perhaps come to the point where we will shell the corn out in the field and will need some method of dry - ing the corn at the crib so it will not spoil. All these things must be worked out. It will take the engineer and the chemist and the farmer working together to develop the best and most economical equipment. Silage Cutter The field silage harvester, drawn through the field by a 1 tractor and cutting the corn up in silage, does away with a great deal of labor in filling silos. It reduces the man labor necessary and that is what we have in mind with all this new machinery. It is necessary, of course, </seg>
            <seg id="p213">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION to have some method of getting the silage from the wagons into the silos, either a blower for the above-ground silos or an arrangement to unload direct into pit silos from the wagons. Chisel Plow - The chisel plow is very little known east of the Rocky Mountains. It is used on the west coast on the wheat land and for orchard work. It consists of a tool with a series of very heavy curved teeth which penetrate into the hardest soil and break it up to a depth of 12 to 16 inches. This merely loosens up the ground, but does not turn it over. Duck Foot Cultivator The duck foot cultivator is' a tool with a Wide winged shovel on a stiff shank. It cuts off the weeds and leaves the surface ridged and cloddy. The fine soil is sifted through leaving the clods and trash on the surface of the soil, It is an excellent tool for controlling weeds on summer fallow. Rod Weeder The rod weeder is another tool that is used in summer tillage work, and consists essentially of a long horizontal rod, either square or round, iproperly attached to some standards. The rod is driven so that it re - volves beneath the surface of the ground. It tears the roots of weeds loose and pulverizes and mulches the soil. • The Pulverator The pulverator is a new machine that is being brought out. It con - sists of a plow with a mold board cut off about half way and a rotating device which catches the soil and chops it up. It was first brought out 15 or 20 years ago. Other Machines Under Development I have mentioned the newer things that are being brought out and that are being worked on to indicate the effort being made to meet these newer demands. As we go along in our farm operations we will jsee this new equipment brought out from time to time. Two years ago the rotary hoe was announced, and now the people are very much in - terested in it and it is in general use.' I have merely tried to survey the field very rapidly to show the tools that are coming on. SEARL DAVIS, Cass County: What do you consider the best equip - ment for raising corn in eastern Nebraska ? MR. SJOGREN: The attempt in all these things is to reduce the labor cost, and as to the best equipment, I could not answer that because it depends and varies so much with different men and under different conditions. </seg>

The quality of the pastures has decreased very materially from the original and virgin condition. Although there is a vast acreage of pasture land a large per cent of which is adapted only for grazing purposes, only little has been done to learn how the pro- </seg>
            <seg id="p215">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION ductivity of these lands may be maintained or improved. However, the attitude, that nothing can be done to improve the pastures, is changing rapidly. Nebraska has approximately 19,500,000 acres of pasture land, which constitutes one of the greatest natural resources of the state. A re - source that cannot be exhausted if it is properly protected and utilized. Undoubtedly Nebraska pastures have decreased in productivity as have our Kansas pastures. A study which covered twelve of the im - portant grazing counties of Kansas was made by Prof. A. E. Aldous and showed that the carrying capacity of these pastures is about 25 per cent less than it was twenty-five years ago. The region studied contains nearly three million acres of native pasture land. Causes of Pasture Deterioration I ■■ The chief cause of decreased productivity of pasture lands are over - stocking and premature grazing or turning the stock on the pasture too early in the spring. The requirements for growth of the native forage plants are essentially the same as for alfalfa or other perennial forage plants which, if cut too frequently, will die and the space occupied by the desirable plants will be taken by worthless grasses and weeds. Experiments conducted at the Kansas experiment station indicate that if blue stem grasses are clipped closely every two weeks during the growing season for a period of two years the stand will be about de - stroyed. This treatment would be comparable to very close grazing. ■ Grazing too early in the season is injurious mainly because in their early stages of growth all the native forage plants subsist on food materials stored in their roots and crowns until enough leaf area has been produced so that the plant may manufacture its foods. If the leaves are cropped as soon as they appear the stored food material is gradually exhausted and if the process is continued the plant will eventually die. Improvement of Pastures Since it is not feasible to reseed most run down native pastures with tame forage species their improvement must be made through proper stocking and by the use of such grazing methods as will restore the vigor and the stand of the native forage plants. The first step in the improvement of run down pastures is the cor - rection of the causes responsible for their present condition, namely, overstocking and premature grazing. On some pastures where the stand cf desirable forage plants has been greatly reduced it may be necessary to defer grazing or protect the pasture until the forage plants have matured seed. This will greatly increase the vigor of these plants besides increasing the stand from the seed crop. Since these lands are </seg>
            <seg id="p216">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE usually very weedy, it is advisable to check the weedy growth in order to give the desirable species a better chance to increase. I ' ■ i . Results of Pasture Improvement Work ■ !. The Kansas Agricultural Experiment Station started a study of pasture improvement and maintenance in 1915. Dan Casement of Man - hattan has co-operated in the work since that time by supplying the necessary land and cattle. The investigations include methods of handling stock, the effects of burning, weed and brush control, salting stock, reseeding pasture lands, and soil treatments. The projects which have been under way long enough to make the results significant include deferred and rotation grazing, some phases of burning and weed and brush control. Deferred and Rotation Grazing The deferred and rotation system of grazing allows the plants to complete or partially complete their growth about half the time, en - abling them to store reserve food during the periods that grazing is deferred, thus adding to their vigor. The system necessitates the use of at least two pastures, one being grazed the first part of the season for two years in succession while during the next two years grazing is deferred until the latter part of the season and the other pasture is grazed early. The length of time that grazing should be deferred to obtain the greatest benefits and at the same time make full use of the forage has not been definitely determined. At the present time grazing is started in the deferred pasture on July 1. The forage is highly palatable and nutritious at this time. As the grasses reach maturity the protein content decreases and they become less palatable. In this experiment the deferred and rotated system was compared with the season long system, or the method of turning the stock into the pasture at the beginning of the season and continuing grazing until fall. The advantages to be gained by the use of any system of grazing can be largely measured by the amount of grazing obtained and the effect of the grazing on the quantity and quality of the vegetation. The following table gives the number of acres per head of livestock in the pastures grazed under the two systems: </seg>

            <seg id="p218">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE mately 70 per cent more grazing was obtained by the use of the deferrea and rotation system as compared with season long grazing. A study of the effect of the intensity of grazing practiced under the two systems on the quantity and quality of the vegetation shows there has been a very significant improvement of the pasture grazed under the deferred and rotation system as compared with the one where season long grazing was practiced. Burning Pastures There is considerable difference of opinion regarding the benefits and possible detrimental effects of burning. We know that burning as ordinarily practiced is not injurious at once. The immediate effects of burning are no doubt small and it is not until the combined effects have had an opportunity to become apparent that one can determine the wisdom of the practice. In order to obtain definite information on the effects of burning, experiments were started in 1918. The information obtained thus far shows that burning does stimulate earlier growth in the spring. The earlier growth on the burned areas is accounted for by the higher soil temperatures. A summary of five years data shows that the tempera - tures on the burned plots averaged about four and one-half degrees higher at a depth of one inch than they did on the unbumed plots. The unburned areas produced about 15 per cent more' vegetation than the burned areas, but there were less weeds on the burned areas.

The later the burning is done the more effective it is in eradicating both weeds and brush. Burning done about the middle of May practically eradicated buck brush and sumac in one year. If such burning is to be effective there must be considerable dry material on the field so that the parts of the brush above ground will be thoroughly burned. </seg>

Late burning should not be practiced except for controlling weeds and brush. - The fact that burning: reduces the yield of grass shows that burn - ing should not be done any more frequently than is absolutely necessary for uniform utilization and for the control of weeds and brush. Short grass pastures should never be burned. Teed Control As has already been stated, burning rather late in the season is effective in eradicating both weeds and brush. The more weedy and brushy pastures ordinarily do not produce enough inflammable material, however, to make the burning effective. On such land it may be advis - able to protect or lightly graze the pasture in order to accumulate enough dry material so that burning can be effectively done. </seg>

With most plants this is at that stage of growth when the leaves have fully developed or at about the time of blooming. The experiments conducted by Prof. A. E. Aldous of the Kansas station show that when buck brush was cut on May 10, or at the full leaf stage, the cutting was 87 per cent effective in destroying the brush. Cutting early in the season, as during April, or later, as during August, resulted in an increase in the number of buck brush stems.

THROCKMORTON: We have very little trouble with wild hemp, f If it grows along the fences and destroys the grass I would cut it with a scythe. We find in burning that when a weed has produced its full foliage it is the best time to cut or burn it.

Mr. Paul H. Stewart will talk to us now on "Some Things Nebraska Farmers Are Doing to Improve Their Pastures." WHAT NEBRASKA FARMERS ARE DOING TO IMPROVE THEIR PERMANENT PASTURES P. H. STEWART Gentlemen: You have just heard Mr. Hildebrand, your chairman, infer that my past has not been what it should be. I have always con - sidered our chairman an honest, truthful man, but the story he has just told shakes my confidence in him. In fact, I now see him in a differ - ent light. I understand that the "Nebraska Farmer" is starting a state - wide "Liars' Contest" with two men on each team. I firmly believe that if our honorable chairman and I should enter the contest we would win in a' walk-a-way and I would not have to say a word. In opening a discussion on the subject of pastures, it may sound ridiculous to say that, from the standpoint of profits per farm, probably the permanent pasture lands of eastern Nebraska which are suitable for farming may be improved most' by breaking them up. That is ex - actly what many of our eastern Nebraska farmers are doing. It is very doubtful if one is justified in leaving in blue grass land which is suitable for the plow. Farm records bear out that statement. In Cass county, for instance, blue grass pasture has given unsatisfactory returns per acre compared to other crops, according to the records of farmers. There is, however, in eastern Nebraska considerable land which is not suitable for cropping. Perhaps it is subject to overflow or is too steep to farm on account of the danger of erosion. Possibly machinery ■ difficulties are too great on the slopes or perhaps the land is stony. The problem is, what can be done to such pasture .lands to improve them, They are the lands to which we are now giving consideration. Have Little Definite Pasture Information Unfortunately when we come to discuss pastures we find that there is a woeful lack of real information, and much that we say is based on theory, speculation and observation. Pasture lands get little care and little thought on the whole. They are the poorer acres of the farm usually and as such are given scant attention. Probably this is because we get the returns from the grasslands so indirectly. We are not able to see clearly the income or lack of income from them. Wheat or corn, for instance, makes so many bushels which can readily be converted into </seg>

We give attention to our grain lands because we treasure their cash return. And as was said in the Sermon on the Mount, "Where your treasure is there will your heart be also." Human nature today is the same as it was 2,000 years ago. We do have many thin, weedy, permanent pastures in eastern Ne - braska. It has been said that an English farmer traveling across Ne - braska in August was much interested in the appearance of our pasture lands. In England, you know, pastures are given much consideration. Finally this Englishman remarked, "I have just figured out a rule that your farmers go by in handling their pastures. It is this: If you have pasture for 10 cows — keep 20, you will get just as much milk and in addition you will be richer by having twice as many cows." </seg>

            <seg id="p228">REPOKT OK NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE What Causes Weeds to Come In? Why do many of our pastures get thin and weedy? You occa - sionally hear the statement made that weeds come in and crowd the grasses cut. I doubt the accuracy of that statement. Probably the grasses were gone or were at least going before the weeds came in. Grass, given a chance, will fight weeds a royal battle for the possession of a field and probably win. Some one or some thing was on the side of the weeds helping to fight the grass. And this thing was probably over - pasturing. Just why should overgrazing be such an important factor in pasture management? The reason goes back to a fundamental activity in plant growth — the manufacture of plant food in the green leaves. How, for instance, do you fight perennial weeds ? By keeping the top growth down and thereby depleting the food reserve stored in the roots and in that way starve out the plant, you reply. That is exactly what we. do when we keep our pastures grazed short all season. The roots are de - pleted of their food reserves and are weakened or even killed, allowing weeds to come in. There is no doubt but what overgrazing is an im - portant cause of poor pastures and that if grasses are allowed to develop a reasonable amount of top growth the total yearly yield will be much greater. Some careful experimental tests show that blue grass kept closely clipped for a season made only one-fourth as much growth as that cut when almost ripe. Close grazing also favors the evaporation of soil moisture, as there is no grass cover for protection. How to avoid overgrazing or to at least defer grazing until the pasture grasses have made some growth should be carefully considered. Dividing the pasture has Tjeen suggested, pasturing one portion first one year and the other part first the following year. Probably the use of temporary pastures such as Sudan grass, sweet clover and fall rye will be the most important practice to following in order to allow the per - manent pastures to build up. Other' speakers will discuss these crops, so I will merely recommend their use. Pastures Low in Available Nitrogen We are usually inclined to believe that pasture lands are rich in available nitrogen because here again we measure results by what grain crops on the same land will do. Pastures are usually high in the total nitrogen content, but much of this material is not available to plants being tied up chemically with carbonaceous material. When broken out, however, this material is broken down by bacterial action and the nitro - gen becomes available, producing the rank, dark green growth character - istic of crops on .new land. The fact that an application of manure or nitrogen fertilizer to grasslands increases the growth in practically all cases proves that available nitrogen is deficient. </seg>
            <seg id="p229">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION The question is how, under farm conditions, can farmers add nitro - gen to their pastures. Commercial nitrogen fertilizers are too expensive for consideration for such conditions and there is, for the most part, altogether too little manure available for the cultivated fields, not to mention pastures. Here I want to suggest the use of sweet clover seeded into thin pastures in the early spring, say late March or early April. This year in- four counties some work along this line was carried on with results which indicate that the practice can be used with some success. One state (Wisconsin) has found that where sweet clover was seeded into pastures in this way the combined yield of blue grass and sweet .clover the second year was three times as great as that of similar blue grass areas. Moreover the next year — after the second year sweet clover plants died — the blue grass on this land made three times as much as it did on plats where there had been no sweet clover, due to the nitrogen which had been supplied by the legume plants. Sweet Clover on Pastures in Nebraska Now let us see what some eastern Nebraska farmers have done along this line. George W. Bill of Pleasant Dale, Seward county, reports that he has tried seeding sweet clover on very poor pasture, seeding in February after double disking. He sowed 15 pounds of Yellow Blossom sweet clover per acre and estimated that this made five times more feed the next year than the untreated pasture made. He further suggests that thereafter the. pasture be disked and reseeded every second year. Henry Horn of Falls City, Richardson county, says: "I sowed white sweet clover on double disked and harrowed poor upland timothy pasture on April 5. This made worlds of pasture where before it was very poor." E. E. Baltensperger of Nebraska City, Otoe county, gives his ex - perience as follows: "White sweet clover was sown in March on upland thin blue grass with no soil preparation. I think this the best and easiest way to build up worn out and thin pastures and it adds greatly to the returns per acre." From Harvey W. Hudson, another Richardson county farmer, comes this report: "I have sown both yellow and white blossom sweet clover on the stony hills and bluffs where the wild grass was all killed out and rag weed was thick. Nothing was done to the soil, 12 to 15 pounds were sown during January. The pasture was not grazed for 3 or 4 months, but from that time on from 3 to 4 times as much feed was secured as where there was no sweet clover." </seg>
            <seg id="p230">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE HOARD OF AGRICULTURE " H. E. Darwin of Virginia, in Gage county, gives his ideas of sweet clover on permanent pasture as follows: "On April 10 I seeded white sweet clover en overpastured upland which had been double disked. The cattle were kept off for about two months. It made twice as much pasture and the third year the blue grass came on thick after the sweet clover." . • : Other similar replies from other eastern Nebraska counties could be given; not all of the farmers who reported had success in getting stands because of one condition or another. In some work on seeding A demonstration of various pasture treatments such as disking and seeding in grasses, clipping wesds, and fertilizing an old thin weedy pasture. old pastures which we did this last season we observed a few things which seem to agree very well with the farm experience which was recently reported to us by some thirty eastern Nebraska .farmers. Sum - marizing these things, we would make the following suggestions for the consideration of anyone planning on seeding sweet clover on thin pastures. Treatment for Old Pastures First, disk the field thoroughly — usually double disking with the disks set at a considerable angle. Seeding on disked pastures will be more likely to catch than those on land which has not been stirred. Second, drill the sweet clover in at a shallow depth or broadcast the seed and harrow it. Rains may cover the seed, but drilling or harrow - ing will be safer. </seg>
            <seg id="p231">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION Third, sow as early in the spring as weather conditions will allow late March or very early April being good. Fourth, put on plenty of seed. Where local unhulled seed can be bought cheaply enough this may be used, otherwise use scarified sweet clover. Fifth, do not pasture the first part of the season, or for the whole first season if that is feasible. Use, if necessary, some supplementary pasture of rye, sweet clover or sudan to relieve and rest the permanent pasture. I have already stated that we lack definite information on pasture management. Probably time will show that some of these suggestions are wrong. When we realize that in Nebraska more than 50 per cent of the total acreage is in pasture we can see the importance of giving more consideration to this crop. The work which has been done in the sand hill section of Nebraska' on seeding legumes into the grasslands is just an illustration of the value of work along the line of pasture and meadow improvement. Grasses are important. I wonder how many of you have read the "Eulogy to Grass," written by John James Ingalls of Kansas. I am going to ask your indulgence while I read this as a close to my remarks. Eulogy to Grass John James Ingalls "Next in importance to the divine profusion of water, light and air, those three physical facts which render existence possible, may be reckoned the universal beneficence of grass. Lying in the sunshine among the buttercups and dandelions of May, scarcely higher in intel - ligence than the minute tenants of that mimic wilderness, our earliest recollections are of grass; and when the fitful fever is ended, and the foolish wrangle of the market and the forum is closed, grass heals over the scar which our descent into the bosom of the earth has made, and [the carpet of the infant becomes the blanket of the dead. "Grass is the forgiveness of Nature — her constant benediction. Fields trampled with battle, saturated with blood, torn with the ruts of cannon, grow green again with grass, and carnage is forgotten.

HILDEBRAND: The next speaker needs no introduction to you, because he has been appearing before you for twenty years at least. We will now listen to a talk on the subject. SHOULD ROUGHAGE BE GROUND? MR. H. J. GRAMLICH During recent years the question of grinding feed has received a great deal of attention. Several factors have tended toward making this a subject of considerable interest. The decrease in the acreage of alfalfa hay has tended to cause a shortage of roughage and has been one factor which has been instrumental in interesting people in the grinding of roughage. Another factor which has at least been a talking point for salesmen of equipment is that most farms are at this time equipped with modern tractors which are capable of developing power upon quite an efficient basis, and in addition, grinders have been per - fected to a degree which makes them much more satisfactory than their predecessors were a decade ago. A third factor which tends to arouse interest in grinding is brought to attention by the fact that most feeders are at the present time desirous of making quick turnovers. They are desirous of following a method which will enable the placing of cattle upon full feed in the minimum of time. By grinding roughage and mixing the same with ground grain, a comparatively safe feed product is produced and cattle become accustomed to it very quickly. There are a number of points in favor of grinding roughage and a number which may be mentioned as objections to the practice. For the purpose of getting down to brass tacks in short order, I will list here - with first the objections which can be sustained: First. There is no question but what labor is greatly increased where roughage is ground. Second. There is no denying the fact that in order to satisfactorily grind roughage considerable investment in machinery is necessary and that there is bound to be depreciation upon this property. </seg>
            <seg id="p233">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS 1 ASSOCIATION Third. Dust is quite a factor in grinding roughage. Some mills are equipped with dust controllers; however, even with these the operators of the mills are working in more or less dust continuously, and it is possible that working under such conditions might prove to be exceedingly disagreeable and in some cases injurious to a person'3 health. Another objection which may be raised to the grinding of roughage is ! that of the perishability of the product. Roughage should not be ground for a long period before using. Most satisfactory results are obtained where grinding is resorted to frequently and very little storing is resorted to. This causes some inconvenience. In fact, the big ad - vantage of the silo is obvious when one considers that after the silo is filled, the preparation process is completed for the winter and all that is necessary is to feed the product. Naturally this saves considerable labor during the winter season. Among the points worthy of mentioning as advantages to the grinding of roughage, one might mention the following: First. It permits the proper mixing of concentrate and roughage to best meet the needs of the animal. By the intermixing of concentrate and roughage a rather Bulky mass is produced and it is quite easy to get cattle started on feed without risk of injury due to digestive dis - orders. Where whole roughage is fed, it is practically impossible to mix grain with it in such way that stock will eat the two together. A second point which is advantageous in the grinding of roughage is ! that a saving will be made in total roughage consumed. Where - whole feeds are used, the bulky, woody parts are bound to be wasted to some extent and even though consumed, doubtless are not as thor - oughly digested as when fed ground. Another advantage of grinding roughage is especially apparent when one grinds low-grade products. Many of these are comparatively unpalatable, and by grinding and mixing with grain can be made to serve a very useful function. We are today confronted with a- very serious problem as regards alfalfa hay. The acreage has been very materially reduced in many sections and the quantity of hay available for feeding is much less than could be used to advantage. By grinding this hay it can be made to go somewhat further, and by grinding other roughage we can provide a sufficient volume to take care of more animals than it would otherwise be possible to provide for. This alfalfa problem is so serious in many places that as one feeder from northeastern Nebraska stated in a letter received last week, "alfalfa is so scarce that it is almost extinct." ■ Many farms are now equipped with tractors. The winter work done by these tractors is very limited outside of when used for grinding feed.. By doing considerable grinding, the tractor can be made to pay " . . . ■ . : </seg>
            <seg id="p234">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE for itself to better advantage, as there is a certain amount of overhead and depreciation which must be met whether the machine is in use or standing idle. Fourth. Tractors which are made nowadays seem to be tremen - dously improved over those that were available a few years ago. Con - sequently, the power problem in connection with grinding roughage is not nearly as serious as it would have been a decade ago. Furthermore, mills have been perfected to a high degree and the class of work which they do is much more satisfactory and at the same time depreciation and breakage have been minimized. Grinding tends to provide winter labor for help which one desires to retain throughout the year. Not infrequently a man likes to retain the services of a good employee, and by doing considerable grinding in connection with feeding, the. man can be retained to fairly good ad - vantage. . . The grinding of both roughage and grain is doubtless advantageous where old stock is on feed. Cows, for instance, as well as most classes of butcher stock, can be put on feed very quickly when the ration con - sists of ground grain and roughage. Animals of this class usually give the best return after having been fed a short period of time. Conse - quently, the use of ground feed for them is highly desirable. The teeth of older animals are in such poor condition that they do not satisfac - torily grind either grain or roughage, and by feeding ground products much better results are experienced. i Experimental work has tended to show that fattening animals re - ceiving ground feed gain somewhat more rapidly than those which re - ceive whole grain and roughage. Doubtless a. fair analysis of the facts would be to say that unless grains and roughages are low in price, there may be a material advantage derived from, the grinding of the same. " The man who feeds but one car of stock a year may not be justified in purchasing a complete set of grinding equipment; however, the per - son who feeds regularly upon a relatively large scale and who does not possess a silo should be benefited materially by installing grinding apparatus. MR. HILDEBRAND: We have heard a lot about pastures this afternoon, and now we are going to hear a little about "Pasture Gains — ■ Are They Economical?" by Carl Day of Weeping Water. </seg>
            <seg id="p235">NEBRASKA .CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION PASTURE GAINS — ARE THEY ECONOMICAL? By CARL DAY of Weeping Water First, let me say that we are located in southeastern Nebraska, in Cass county. Our farm includes 320 acres, one-third of it in pasture and the rest in grain and hay crops. We raise from 30 to 35 calves a year from Shorthorn cows. About one-third of them are calved in the fall, and the others from March on. Originally we used purebred sires on good quality grade cows, and later added a few registered females at times, gradually replacing the grades with the best young purebred heifers we raised. While we may have hesitated in buying very ex - pensive dams from fashionable families, we have demanded beef types with above the average milking qualities, and have culled the poorer milkers into the feed lot. We like to get as many calves as possible before grass comes, for the later calves cannot handle all the milk at first, and so the udders require considerable attention for a while. We tried to keep the cost of our cows down to a certain limit so that we can afford to sell our surplus if necessary to the packer profiit - ably. In the case of the sire, we removed the' limit, as we consider the right type of bull a large part of the herd. Our unit is a medium-sized one. We don't make a big killing any year, but neither are our losses very great. It is, as I see it, a safe and sound program for our con - ditions. Began Using Self-feeder About a year ago, one of my boys conceived the idea of building a small self-feeder, suitable for either calves or cows. Possibly the Agri - cultural College is responsible for that. With about $35 worth of ma - terial he constructed a 75-bushel capacity feeder 4 feet wide, 5 feet high and 8 feet long, with V-type bottom, and side troughs 5 inches deep and 10 inches wide. The roof boards extended over the sides, so the drip escapes the trough. It is built on skids and is easily moved. At that time we had 10 or more late fall calves following their dams, so we placed the feeder in one corner of the lot where the breed - ing cows stay at night, and constructed a creep to admit only the calves. The calves soon learned to use the feeder. We coaxed them in at first by putting some nice peagreen alfalfa hay along from the entrance to the trough so they entered of their own accord and were -not afraid. Owing to local drouth conditions during 1926, we were short of alfalfa, and as the price of cotton cake was low, we used cake with ground ear corn to supply more protein. The calves seemed to get accustomed to this feed with almost no cases of scouring. When grass came, we moved the feeder to the pasture and before long the spring calves of -4 to 6 weeks old were en- </seg>
            <seg id="p236">REPOUT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE joying it of their own accord. During the summer we used corn and oats, not ground, and ran out of cotton cake. Creep Feeding Pays Unfortunately we have no scales, and we have not been able to weigh the feed and the calves at proper intervals, so I fear I cannot give very reliable information as to how well this plan will pay. How - ever, I feel sure that our calves during the summer were carrying more flesh than usual, together with a good, hearty growth. In fact, they looked so good to us that about November 15 we sent a truck load of heifers to Omaha. They weighed 800 pounds in Omaha, and brought $12.50 per hundredweight, or $100 per head. That is $10.00 more money than we usually get for them, steers and all, the following June at an average of 14 months and 900 pounds weight. One reason we think creep feeding pays is because we have solved the trouble of weaning time by using it. The cows fuss a little, but the calves don't seem to care much, and as they are on feed they get right down to business in the feed lot, and the feeder takes care of the new crop of fall calves about corn husking time, and it surely does save a lot of chores. Also when a farmer feeds his own crop of calves they are bound to be more or less uneven, due to a difference in age. The feeding of a spring calf until he is well finished is a long, slow task and cannot be hurried much. By using the creep on a bunch of 30 calves one can cut out a truck load of 10 at three different seasons pf the year, and have them fairly well finished. It also gives him an opportunity to take advantage of any high spots in- the market. If he is planning to sell some of his best bull calves or the most promising heifers to fellow breeders, they are better fitted and more attractive, and we don't need to be ashamed of them at any time. It certainly is a labor-saver and we see no reason why it is not as equally efficient on a small herd as on a large one. I am sorry I cannot give you definite figures as to pounds of feed per head or per pound of gain, but we like creep feeding, the calves like it, and we will probably use it 365 days this year. I thank you. HOW I USE SUDAN AND SWEET CLOVER D. S. DALBY, Beatrice I told Mr. Stewart when he wrote asking me to lead the discussion on this subject that I would much prefer to come up and listen and learn rather than to do any talking myself. I want to say that by listening to the speech we just heard I learned enough to justify me for attendance during the whole week, and I want to thank Dr. Van Es </seg>
            <seg id="p237">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION for that splendid talk. It answered some questions I have wanted to have answered. Every time we have a meeting up here, I don't care what kind of a meeting it is, in every session I have attended here dur - ing the last five years, no matter what the subject was to start with, it always gravitated down to sweet clover in the end. J Nineteen years ago I sowed the first sweet clover ever sown in age county, in Sherman township, and it was received with animosity because neighbors thought I was fostering a noxious weed. I was look - ing for something to put nitrogen back into the soil, as we could not get red clover to grow as it did in Illinois. It didn't seem adapted to cur conditions. We tried soy beans, but they were not very promising. I put in sweet clover nineteen years ago on twenty acres of rather poor land that we could not plow because of the gumbo. We thought that this land needed building up worse than any other field. We got a splendid stand, and after the second year, when we went to plow it for wheat, we found to our surprise that the plow went through it easily. I have felt very much gratified that sweet clover has come into its own in Nebraska. I am a great believer in it. One of our men who has been growing sweet clover at my suggestion lost four head of cattle. I wish we had had one of these little instruments of yours, Dr. Van Es, and we would have saved those cows. I We have had enough food for thought this afternoon, and I will not give you indigestion with my little talk. I do not like sudan grass, as it is terribly hard on the land. It may be good for pasture, but sweet clover is what I want because it puts nitrogen and organic matter in the soil. We sow 15 pounds to the acre and sow with two bushels of oats. I notice they say you can grow more sweet clover for pasture if it is seeded without a nurse crop, and that has been my experience. But in our rotation we try to sow sweet clover with the oats and then let the clever grow that year and then the next spring begin pasturing it as soon as we can, and in August turn it under and put it in wheat. There is one of our men here who has covered one quarter section in wheat and clover and has had an average yield of crops this year much better than our general average. He is the man who lost four very fine pure - bred Herefords with bloat I hope we will not have to give up the sweet clover pasture. Where we cut sweet clover for hay we cut it high, about the 15th of June, leaving a good high stubble from which the second crop starts. We cut our seed crop with binders. Now you have heard so much this afternoon that I am not going to say any more, but will try to answer any questions you may have. QUESTION: What do you do with your clover that you cut for hay? MR. DALBY: No matter if it is not entirely dry, we put it in stacks or in the barn. When it comes out it is brown and smells like tobacco. </seg>
            <seg id="p238">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE QUESTION: How abcut sweet clover in winter wheat? MR. DALBY:. I wouldn't recommend it in wheat in Gage county. We are a little too short of rainfall to make the practice a successful one. NEBRASKA'S CORN IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM Recent experimental tests and investigations throughout the corn belt states add weight to the conclusion that the smooth, dimple dent, heavy, horny starch, type of seed ears give the best results when meas - ured by the amount of shelled corn of good quality produced per acre. Such results have substantiated and added additional weight to claims made in the past in Nebraska, that our farmers, by arid large, would profit through selecting a somewhat smoother type of seed ear than they were taught to pick years ago. Many farmers still hold to the idea of selecting seed ears having a high shelling per cent, believing that such ears are superior in yield - ing qualities. As a matter of fact there is not always a correlation be - tween the shelling per cent of seed ears and the acre yield of shelled corn produced by such seed. In some cases ears which appear to have deep kernels are, when actually shelled and weighed up, lower in shelling per cent than ears which have more shallow kernels. The reason for this lies in the fact that very deep kernels are often composed -of soft starch and also have more or less of a hooked dent, all of which makes a lower test weight per bushel. The more shallow kernels are likely to contain a higher per cent of hard starch and, due to this, have a higher test weight per bushel. Therefore what appears to be corn with a high shelling per cent may, often be the opposite. But at any rate, the shell - ing per cent of a seed ear is no criterion by which to judge the yielding ability of the ears. Smooth ears with fairly wide kernels of a hard, more or less flinty nature, and with a good weight, solidity and lustre, are the most likely to yield well and to prove well adapted. The Nebraska Agricultural College has now for several years been advocating and selecting the smooth type corn in co.rn shows. Farmers who have come in contact with these shows and with, demonstrations of smooth and rough selections of corn in field tests have quite generally come to adopt the ideas advocated by the Nebraska Agricultural College. County agents, through demonstrations, have done much to show the superior yielding quality of the smooth, heavy, dimple dented seed type and to convince' farmers by actual field tests that such selections are superior to the ear held up as the ideal some 15 or 20 years ago. One of the best reasons for corn shows is to afford an opportunity to compare ear types and to discuss the correlation between such points. </seg>
            <seg id="p239">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION as ear type, plant type, growing season, water requirement, and yield per acre. Corn shows also attract corn growers, at which time soil fertility, cultural practices, and general production methods may be discussed. It is now generally recognized by thinking farmers that the difference in actual value and producing ability of a number of well selected exhibits of the correct type is small and therefore one cannot attach any great importance to the corn show winners providing a con - siderable number of well selected exhibits were present for considera - tion. Corn growers are looking forward to the time when they can use, in a practical way, the results of corn improvement by inbreeding and hybridization. It is expected that eventually greater yields, better quality, stiffer stalks, stronger shanks, and other desirable character - istics will be available to the corn grower through the efforts of corn breeders. Until that time comes, however, corn growers will benefit by selecting the correct type of seed from good, well adapted varieties, paying careful attention to stalk strength and development, height of ear, strength and position of shank, and other utility points. Farmers who have the correct type of seed ears in mind and who have the patience to develop that type of corn through selection can probably produce on their own farm, after a term of years, a strain of corn which will yield above the average. Others will prefer to buy such seed from a neighbor. It would seem worth while for the Nebraska Crop Growers' Association to initiate a movement to test out carefully a large number of lots of corn from various Nebraska farmers in an effort to determine what particular ones, if any, have special merit as high yielders in various parts of the state. Such corn would then be available to those who do not care to develop a good type of corn themselves, but who prefer, to buy from a proven source. Perhaps such a program would be of more value to the. state than our present corn show.

The minutes of the 1928 meeting were read and adopted. A general discussion was held on the Nebraska Seed Law and the matter of noxious weeds in seed being offered for sale, general labelling and enforcement of the law. It was brought out that much poor quality seed and seed containing noxious weeds is being sold in the state. A motion was carried that a com - mittee of three be appointed to draw up resolutions relative to the seed situation and to report these after the noon-day recess. President Magee appointed Mr. Bierman, J. D. Hasik, and Stewart as the com - mittee. It was moved by Hasik, seconded by Mr. Wetzel, that the office of Assistant Secretary of the Nebraska Crop Growers' Association be created, due to the demands for increased assistance on account of the extra amount of work the association is carrying on. The motion was carried unanimously. It was moved, seconded, and carried that D. L. Gross be appointed to the office of assistant secretary for the year of 1929. The matter of State Fair exhibits was discussed. The general idea seemed to be that much of the material in the Agricultural Hall was old and of little interest because of that fact. It was also brought out that much of the material is of a miscellaneous sort of little value, agriculturally, in the state of Nebraska. It was also believed that the exhibits are monotonous, due to having a great deal of miscellaneous material repeated in the various exhibits. The general discussion brought out the idea that a movement might be started to develop </seg>

One would be the county collective class, much as it is conducted at the 'present, the second would be specials for standard- Nebraska products and a third class would be for original exhibits showing some particular idea or products or in - dustry in relation to certain counties. It was moved by Gross and seconded by Crowell that a committee of three be appointed to meet with Mr. Jackson of the State Board of Agriculture to discuss Class F, and that this committee consist of the President, Secretary of the Association, and Mr. Biermann. The motion was carried unanimously. The letter written by. the Secretary to the State Board of Managers, State Board of Agriculture, was read. This outlined the activities of the association for 1929. It was the opinion of the Vice-presidents that an exhibit should be prepared for Chicago International Grain and Hay Show if funds can be arranged. It was moved by Hasik, seconded by Mr. Berger, that the Chicago exhibit be prepared and that the officers act as they see fit as to funds and men in charge. The matter of rules governing seed certification was considered. Upon recommendation of Dr. Kiesselbach, the Ceres spring wheat was added to the list of certified varieties and Minnesota 184 barley was dropped. Glabron barley was suggested for future consideration. A few other minor changes in the wording of the rules were made. The following resolutions were read by the committee appointed to 1 repare them and adopted by the meeting as a whole: WHEREAS, There is still being sold in Nebraska considei-able alfalfa seed from southwestern states as shown by the fact that samples are reaching the state, seed analyst in which Johnson grass seed is found, and WHEREAS, Lots of imported Argentine alfalfa seed in which 10 per cent of the seed is stained orange red are being offered to Nebraska farmers under the claim that such seed is satisfactory for our con - ditions and that the staining is for the purpose of showing its value, while as a matter of fact the Nebraska Experiment Station has found such seed unsuitable and it is so stained by the U. S. D. A. to show that it is not adapted to conditions in this state, and WHEREAS, Some firms are advertising and offering for sale in Nebraska lots of low quality seed, featuring this at a very low price, and that such seed is dangerous to plant in many cases due to its containing seeds of serious perennial weed pests such as Canada thistle; there - fore </seg>
            <seg id="p250">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE' BOARD OF AGRICULTURE BE IT RESOLVED: (1) That publicity be given to the danger of buying alfalfa seed about which there is no definite authentic information as to the origin, as such seed may prove unhardy and unsatisfactory. (2) That assistance be given to see that the Nebraska seed law is thoroughly and impartially enforced to require that all lots of seed offered for sale be tagged and labelled as to purity and germination. (3) That Nebraska farmers be urged to be cautious in buying seed on the basis of price only, as such lots of seed are likely to be foul with weeds and generally unsatisfactory and expensive in the end. (4) That Nebraska' farmers in purchasing alfalfa seed be advised to insist on verified seed when buying common alfalfa and sealed and certified seed if Grimm alfalfa is desired. (5) That farmers be urged to assist in the fight against serious weed pests by not harvesting seed crops from fields infested with serious weed pests, the seed of which may be mixed with the seed crop. (6) That the appreciation of the Nebraska Crop Growers' Asso - ciation be extended to seed firms who are handling high quality seed and alfalfa seed of known origin and who are thus doing much to benefit Nebraska's agriculture. .

H. DAFT, Lincoln SECRETARY L. K. CROWE, Lincoln MR. L. H. DAFT: Mr. Haecker just called my attention to some - thing that I am sure will interest all of you. He was showing this gavel to his father who is here. You all know Mr. Haecker and his father. In 1885, this gavel was made of seven different kinds of Ne - braska wood. This was before some of you folks here were born. It has been used by the presiding officer of the Nebraska State Dairy - men's Association every year since that time and there are inscribed on the silver ferrules all the names of the various presidents of the Nebraska State Dairymen's Association since 1885. I thought this might be of interest in opening the meeting of this association. This session is the forty-fourth annual meeting of the Nebraska State Dairy - men's Association. If we pause for a moment and think back to con - ditions forty-four years ago, when this association was organized, I am certain that we will be imbued with a profound sense of respect and admiration for the men who, under conditions such as existed at that time, had the courage to form the Nebraska State Dairymen's Association. For certainly, forty-four years ago, the dairy industry in the State of Nebraska was not in a very flourishing or promising condition. In the forty-four years which have elapsed since this or - ganization first started, there has been a great change in the agricul - tural program of this particular state. Today, dairying is one of the most important features of the agricultural industry, and every part of our state is interested in some feature of dairy farming or in </seg>
            <seg id="p281">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION the handling and manufacture of dairy products. Perhaps not all of pur own people and perhaps very few outside of the state realize the fact that Nebraska today ranks fourth of all the states in the manu - facture of creamery butter. During the last years, there has been a great increase in the production of cheese arid the state has made other marked advances in the various phases of the industry. With pur great acreage of alfalfa, and high standing as producers of com, hundreds of farmers are turning to the dairy cow as a means of stabiliz - ng their financial affairs. It would be unbecoming on my part to consume a great deal of the ;ime allotted to this program, because we have speakers of national and international reputation who can put the time to much better use than I. However, I think we might well pause for a moment to con - sider what this association has been doing during the past twelve months. Some folks who attend these meetings from year to year may get the notion that the annual meeting is the only activity of the Nebraska State Dairymen's Association. That is not the case. The activities of the association are year around. There is hardly a month in which there is not something of importance in which this association takes an active part. The year opened with the annual meetjng, January 4, 1928. The first event was the regular annual dairy cattle judging con - test. The contribution of the association to this contest was the award - ing of one gold, two silver and two bronze medals to the high scoring individuals in both the breeder's and student's sections. One object of the- organization is to recognize achievement in various phases of dairy activities and we have a plan of awarding medals and certificates of honor to men who have achieved certain accomplishments within the dairy industry. A trophy cup and three medals were awarded in the dairy herd improvement team section of the annual judging contest and three medals in the dairy herd improvement association testers' section. Approximately three hundred _ people attended the afternoon session. The speakers were Karl Musser, Secretary of the American Guernsey Cattle Club; A. J. Glover, Editor of Hoard's Dairyman, and E. M. Harmon, Editor of the Dairy Farmer. As part of the program, a gold medal was awarded to Mr. Ira Hepperly, who owned the high herd of cows in association work for the year. His herd of six cows produced an average of 461 pounds butterfat. Mr. Owen Moore re - ceived the second medal for having the second high herd of cows. His herd of twenty-two cows produced an average of 453 pounds of butter - fat. A trophy cup was awarded to the association having the highest average butterfat production. The cup was awarded to the North Platte Valley Association, which had an average of 320 pounds of butterfat per cow for the entire association. This cup was won in 1926 by the Lancaster Association. Sixty-nine bronze medals were awarded to own- </seg>
            <seg id="p282">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ers of herds that produced over 300 pounds of butterfat. Twenty-one dairymen received honorable mention for having: qualified for the Dairy - men's Association medal in 1926 and 1927. Medals, however, are given for one year only, and now a certificate is presented to those qualifying more than once. About seventy-five men interested in dairying attended the Dairy and Livestock Breeders' Banquet on Thursday evening. The speakers for the Dairymen's Association were Mr. Glover, Mr. Musser and Mr. Daft. The annual high school judging contest was held in the spring of 1928. Thirty-three teams comprising ninety-nine individuals competed. A trophy cup was awarded to the" high ranking team and a silver and a bronze medal to the two high scoring individuals. Similar awards were made in the Curtis-Lincoln School of Agriculture contest A silver and bronze medal -were awarded to the high scoring individuals in the Babcock testing contest in which there were twenty-five con - testants. Bronze medals were presented to eighteen members of the dairy demonstration teams as champions of nine counties. Exhibit material prepared by the association -was distributed to county fairs in co-operation with the extension service of the Univer - sity, county agricultural agents and dairy herd improvement association testers. The following counties were supplied with exhibit material: Adams, Buffalo, Cass, Custer, Douglas, Fillmore, Franklin, Furnas,' Gage, Hall, Harlan, Phelps, Morrill, Platte, Polk and Seward. These exhibits covered the following subjects: Feeding the dairy cow; Management of the dairy calf; Dairy herd improvement; Breeding. Exhibit ma - terial was furnished to the Lincoln Y. W. C. A. and to Roberts Sanitary Dairy for the Greater Lincoln Exposition. An exhibit covering seventy - five feet of wall space was erected at the Nebraska State Fair. This exhibit featured the following points: The value of diversified farming as compared to one crop farming; Percentage composition of milk; Balancing farming with the dairy cow; The value of dairy herd improve - ment associations; Food value of milk, a part of which showed rats that had been fed vitamin deficient feeds as compared to rats receiving a ration sufficient in all vitamins. These rats were part of an experimental colony maintained by the Department of Dairy Husbandry of the Uni - versity of Nebraska. This association subscribed to the fund that sent the Nebraska Champion Judging team to Europe. The president was honored with the chairmanship of the committee which raised this fund. Assistance was rendered to the dairy cattle and dairy products judging teams representing the University of Nebraska at the Dairy Cattle Congress and the National Dairy Exposition. A delegate was sent to the Dairy </seg>
            <seg id="p283">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN-S ASSOCIATION Pilgrimage at Washington, D. C, last May and another to the National Dairy Show at Memphis. Mr. R. C. Johnson served as superintendent of dairy cattle at the State Fair and Professor H. P. Davis .served in the same capacity at the Ak-Sar-Ben Show. A committee representing the Nebraska State Dairymen's Associa - tion and the breed associations secured a substantial increase in premium money for dairy cattle exhibited at the Nebraska State Fair. When the revision committee reported. they recommended an increase of $200 to dairy cattle and an increase of $2854 for beef cattle. The matter was appealed to the Board of Managers of the Nebraska State Fair, and they granted an increase to dairy cattle of $1117. We are going to meet the revision committee again next Friday. I wish to announce to the committee that we meet at Secretary Jackson's office, Friday evening at 7:30. While these activities have been outlined in brief, we have the detailed report of the activities in the secretary's published report which goes to every member of the association. Last year it was issued in April. With the cooperation of Secretary Jackson, we were able to get out the report much earlier than before. Credit for getting the report out early and the information I have given you belongs entirely to our efficient secretary, Mr. Crowe. He has served the associa - tion most faithfully in his present capacity. Much work has been made possible by the splendid cooperation of such organizations as the Ne - braska Dairy Development Society, the breed associations, the creamery associations, the Dairy Department of the College and other organiza - tions interested in the dairy industry of the state. Having served for a number of years on the board of directors, and now bringing to a close a year as president, I want to express my personal appreciation and thanks to all those fine men who have given so generously of their time and their efforts to bring about the success of the various enterprises which we have undertaken. I can on one. point recognize a weakness in this organization. At the be - ginning of the last year we made an effort to correct it. Our association ought to have a much larger membership than we have had. We have two sources of revenue, appropriation through the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture and the second means of revenue is through cur membership. The membership fee is only one dollar. If we go to a show or banquet we cannot get anywhere with a dollar. You get for one dollar all the benefits that the association can give by promoting the dairy industry of the state. The annual report put out in booklet form will give a report of all talks made here this afternoon and a lot of other valuable information for every dairyman in the state. I wish </seg>
            <seg id="p284">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE to invite everyone here who has a direct or an indirect interest in the dairy industry in the State of Nebraska to join this association. It would be very easy to enlarge our program and activities if we had a larger membership. I have taken more time than I should and will hasten on to other items on the program. At this time I want to announce the following committees which have been previously appointed and have perhaps already met: Nomination committee, Frank Putman, M. L. Flack and H. L. Gilmore. This committee will please report at the business session later in the afternoon. Resolutions committee, It. W. McGinnis, Sumner Barnell and C. K. Morse. The man who was first asked to act as chair - man of this committee was unable to be' here, so we had to change the committee, so that may make it necessary for the committee to retire and bring in their report a little later on. The State Dairymen's Association has a reputation pretty well established and one which we are anxious to. maintain. This association has a reputation for always presenting a good program. We always have men who have a message for dairymen of Nebraska. We always have men of prominence and authority and this year is no exception to the general rule. We are especially fortunate in having a repre - sentative, by the way he is the senior dairy husbandman of the United States Department of Agriculture. He has under his charge the tabula - tion of dairy herd improvement association records. I suppose this man has looked over the combined reports of more dairy herd improve - ment association records than any other man in the world. He has made a study of these reports and figures and he has a message for us this afternoon. We are interested in dairy herd improvement asso - ciations whether we are members or not. Those who are members realize its value and the others are being converted to the idea. It gives me great personal and sincere pleasure on my part to be able to intro - duce to cur Nebraska Dairymen, Dr. J. C. McDowell, of the Bureau of Dairying of the United States Department of Agriculture of Washing - ton, D. C. DR. McDOWELL: A friend of mine, Sam Brown of Montana, is a young man of six foot two. He is very bright and wit^y, but he always stutters -when he gets excited. One day he and I were on a train traveling across Wisconsin as far as the $:ity of Portage. Sam had never been in Wisconsin before, so the name Portage was new to him. The conductor came along, took our tickets, punched a slip and put the slip in my hat. After lunch, when we returned from the diner, we discovered that our seats in the day coach had been taken by a couple of ladies. I found another seat in that coach, but Sam went into the next coach ahead. Pretty soon </seg>
            <seg id="p285">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION :'•■■•■■' ■ ! the conductor came along, and seeing no slip in Sam's hat, held out his hand and said "ticket, please." . Sam searched for his ticket and not finding it became excited and began to stutter. The conductor re - marked, "Well, where are you going?" By this time Sam was so excited that he had completely forgotten the name of the station. In telling me about it afterward, he said, "Th th th there I was, a full grown man; I didn't have any ticket and I didn't know where I was going." Every dairy farmer should, if possible, become a member of one of our Dairy Herd Improvement Associations in order that he may know the production and income record of his cows. Otherwise he will find himself much in the same fix as Sam, when he didn't have a ticket and didn't know where he was going. For just a little while today I want to talk to you about the dairy herd improvement association records of the United States, and especially about Nebraska records. But before I go into this subject, I wish to deliver a message from O. E. Reed, Chief of our Bureau of Dairy Industry. Professor Reed was requested by your State Dairy - men's Association to address this meeting. He- asked me to tell you that he has just started in his new work as Chief of our Bureau, he has found it impossible to get away from the office at this time, but he says he will be glad to come on invitation next year if possible. So this year for this number on your program you will have to put up with one of Professor Reed's assistants, but next year you may have the Chief himself. During the past few years, it has been my good fortune to have charge of the tabulation of the dairy herd improvement association records from all parts of the United States. These records are a gold mine of. useful information. They cover a wide range of dairy topics and show actual production under normal farm conditions. The tabulation of more than one hundred thousand yearly and individual cow records has shown that as butterfat production increased from one hundred pounds in the first group to five hundred pounds in the last group, there was a very rapid and very constant increase in income over cost of feed. At one hundred pounds of butterfat a year per cow the income over cost of feed was $14, at one hundred fifty pounds it was $34, the next fifty pounds raised the income over cost of feed to $54, the next to $76, the next to $96, the next to $116, the next to $138, the next to $168, and the next to $178. As butterfat pro - duction increased from one hundred pounds . a year per cow to five hundred pounds a year per cow the income over cost of feed advanced from $14 to $178, or as butterfat production increased five times the income over cost of feed increased thirteen times. You perhaps have </seg>
            <seg id="p286">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE noticed that for every increase of fifty pounds in butterfat production there was a corresponding increase of $20, $21 or $22 in income over cost of feed per cow. A dry-goods merchant in Washington has a son named Abie who is attending high school. One day Abie heard a lecture on the subject of business ethics. He didn't understand the lecture very well, so when he got home he said, "Father, what do they mean by business ethics?" The father replied, "Well, Abie, I will explain exactly what they mean by business ethics. The other day a man came into our store and bought a number of different things. In payment he handed me a $20 bill. As I was putting the $20 bill away I noticed that there was another $20 bill attached to it. Now, Abie, there was a fine point, a very fine point in business ethics. The question was should I keep that extra $20, or should I share it with my partner?" I wish to say to the dairymen of Nebraska assembled here this afternoon that if the production of your cows increases and the high producers return extra $20 bills, it is good business ethics for the dairy farmer to keep all that extra money. Suppose we analyze these production figures a little farther. In case we ever have a surplus of dairy products in this country, which cows shall we blame for producing that surplus? Shall we blame the high producers or the low producers? You noticed that one cow pro - ducing five hundred pounds of butterfat a year gave an income over cost of feed of $178, and that it takes thirteen cows each producing one hundred pounds to bring in approximately the same income above feed cost, but one cow puts five hundred pounds of butterfat on the market, while the thirteen cows put thirteen hundred pounds on the market. Therefore, the thirteen cows put eight hundred pounds more butterfat on the market than the one cow, yet they return no more to their owner in income over cost of feed. It would seem, therefore, that if the market is ever flooded with dairy products that the low producers and not the high producers will be to blame. On January 1, 1928, there were sixteen Dairy Herd Improvement Associations in Nebraska. On January 1, 1929, there were twenty-three associations in operation in this State, or a gain of seven over the preceding year. That is a very satisfactory gain, a gain of more than forty per cent. I have not had time to analyze carefully the figures that we have received from all your associations, although we have made herd and association summaries of each. I wish to say, however, that just before leaving Washington, I ran over the figures of the past four years for your Douglas County Association, and I found that for the first of the four years the association average butterfat production per cow was 260 pounds, the second year it was 280 pounds, </seg>
            <seg id="p287">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION • I . ■ the third year 293 pounds, and the fourth and last year for which we have a record it was 296 pounds. That is a very satisfactory gain for so short a period. In one of your associations that had about twenty-five herds on test there was a seven-cow herd and a f ourteen-cow herd that made an interesting comparison. The average production per cow for the f ourteen-cow herd was 131 pounds of butterfat, for the seven-cow herd it was 328 pounds, or two and one-half times as much. The fourteen - cow herd had an income under cost of feed of $14, or each cow, on an average, lacked $14 of paying her feed cost. The seven-cow herd had •an average income over cost of feed per cow of $120. The fourteen - cow herd lacked $196 of paying for the cost of feed, while the seven-cow herd had a total income over cost of feed of $840. The owner of the : smaller herd could sleep an hour later every morning and finish his chores as early as the other man. He could get through with his dairy work an hour earlier every evening and go to a movie while the owner of the larger herd was still busy milking and caring for his low pro - ducing dairy cows. What's better, at the end of the year the owner of the smaller herd would have $840 to spend on necessaries and luxuries, while the owner of the fourteen cows would- have to fish deep down in his jeans and dig up $196 to_ pay for a year's pleasure in milking and caring for his herd of low producing dairy cows. We are sometimes asked if the Dairy Herd Improvement Associa - tion records give any indication as to which is the best breed of dairy cows. I wish to say frankly that the records do not indicate that there is any best breed. Often I have heard people argue, without any figures to back up their arguments, that the Holstein is the best breed, others with the same lack of backing have argued that the Jersey is the best, others that the Guernsey is best, others that the Ayrshire is best. But, a tabulation of hundreds of thousands of yearly individual cow records from the Dairy Herd Improvement Association figures does not sup - port any of these arguments. Yet people will argue in support of one particular breed. A friend of mine, T. A. Hoverstad, of the Great Western Railway, says that when he was a student in the Minnesota State University he had a roommate who was a Democrat. Hoverstad himself was a Republican. One evening they decided to talk politics, and they argued ■ long, loud, and late. Finally they went to bed and went to sleep. Hoverstad says that when they woke up in the morning, he was a Democrat and his roommate was a Republican. During the argument of the preceding evening, each had converted the other. I have never known it to work out that way when people have argued regarding ... '■'. (9.) </seg>
            <seg id="p288">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTUKE the merits of the different breeds. After the argument was over, each was of the same opinion still. The Dairy Herd Improvement Association records have shown that within the breed the big cows win. They have not shown any' such relation between the breeds. The big Holsteins win out as compared with the middle sized and small Holsteins in production of milk, in production of butterfat and in income over cost of feed. The big Jersey wins out as compared with the small and middle sized Jersey in pro - duction of milk, in production of butterfat and in income over cost of feed. The same is true of each of the other dairy breeds. Within the breed the big cows win. We have a manuscript about ready for publica - tion giving figures on this important subject. The Dairy Herd Improvement Association figures show that the cows that have a long lactation period win out over all others. Did you ever realize that our dairy cows, on an average, remain in the herd only about five years from the time they reach production age? If a dairy cow does not freshen until she is two and one-half years of age, and remains in the herd only five years, she is disposed of at the age of seven and one-half years. That cow has lived one-third of her life before she produced any milk at all. If during her five producing years she was dry three months in every twelve, she was dry one and one - fourth years out of the five. Add one and one-fourth years to two and one-half, and the sum is three and three-fourths, exactly half the life time of the cow. A dairyman near Omaha, Nebraska, had a cow he named "Prohibition" because she was dry so much of the time. ' If our dairy cows were all high producers it would be advisable to keep them in the herd much more than five years from the time they reach production age, and each of those years they should produce milk foi ten and one-half or eleven months. The Dairy Herd Improvement Association records have shown that the cows that freshen in the fall and early winter excel all others in production of milk, in production of butterfat and in income over cost of feed. A tabulation of about twenty thousand yearly and individual cow records shows that the cows that freshen in the fall and early winter were about eleven per cent ahead of those that freshen at any other time of the year in production of milk, production of butterfat,. and in income above feed cost. Some time ago I gave a talk on Dairy Herd Improvement Associa - tion work in Charlottesville, Virginia. After I was through an old farmer came up and told me that when he joined the Dairy Herd Im - provement Association he was the owner of fourteen cows. He said he did not know what each of those cows was producing, but that he </seg>
            <seg id="p289">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION did know he was not making any money. He said that before the end of the year he discovered that seven of his cows were very profitable and that seven were decidedly unprofitable. He said it reminded him of the old Hebrew-Egyptian story of the seven fat years and the seven lean years, because as the seven lean years ate up the seven fat years, so the seven low producing dairy cows ate up the profits the other cows made. One day while! analyzing dairy herd improvement association records a very fine appearing young man came into my office and tcld me that he was a Hindu from India, and that he had been in this country for some time and had recently graduated from the California State University. He informed me that he had become very much -interested in dairy herd improvement association work and would like to introduce dairy herd improvement associations into his native land. He asked me to tell him something about organizing these associations and about the results obtained. I went ahead and briefly outlined the work to him as we conduct it in this country. Among other things, I told him that we discovered the low producing dairy cows, culled them out at once and sent them immediately to the butcher. He stopped me there and said that they couldn't do that in India, because the Hindu considers that the cow is sacred. He said that it wouldn't do any good to cull them out, because if they couldn't kill them, they would have to support them anyway. At once I thought of a lecture given by Mr. Higginbottom, a Methodist missionary. Mr. Higginbottom says that to the Hindu 'all animals are sacred and that the Hindu will not kill any animal, not even a rat He told us the story of a Hindu village that was completely overrun by rats. The rats were so numerous that they ate up every - thing in sight The Hindus had no "Pied Piper of Hamelin" to lead the rats away to the river and drown them, so in desperation they set some great big box traps and caught the rats. But when they had caught them, the question was what were they going to do with them? They were tender-hearted and couldn't bear to see the rats starve to death, and their religion said that they shouldn't kill any animal. Finally a lucky thought struck them and one dark night they carried all those boxes over close to another Indian village and let the rats loose. Thinking about this, I suggested to the Hindu that they turn their low producing cows loose in the mountain districts, but he said that it wouldn't do because that would be the same thing as killing them. Then I suggested this idea, which seemed to appeal to him. I said to the Hindu, "You have almost exactly the same problem that the breeders of purebred dairy cattle have in this country. The Hindu considers ithat the cow is sacred, the breeder of purebred dairy cattle in this country considers that the pedigree is almost sacred. The Hindu does </seg>
            <seg id="p290">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE no culling or killing:, the breeder of purebred dairy cattle, in this country, does very little culling and killing. Through breeding alone, the breeders of dairy cattle in this country have managed to improve the dairy herds so much that the purebred dairy cattle of this country are producing on an average about 7 to 10 per cent more per cow than the grade herds, although the grade herds are constantly culled." The Hindu told me that he believed that they could accomplish a great deal in dairy herd improvement association work through breed - ing, even though culling and killing was not allowed, and went away quite satisfied. After he had gone, I sat down at my desk and 'wrote this sentence, "We are heirs to the most brilliant and valuable thoughts of the greatest minds of all the ages, but let us be 'thankful that, here in America, we are not slaves to the traditions and superstitions of the past." It seems too bad that we are not closely culling our purebred dairy herds. Under the herd test plan of the Holstein-Friesian Association, a dairyman is allowed to leave a record out of the herd average pro - viding he surrenders the certificate of registration to the national association before the end of the eleventh month of the testing year. During the first eight months after this began, more than one hundred certificates of registration had been surrendered to be cancelled. That is just a beginning. I predict that the good work will go on until all purebred dairy herds are closely culled. The herd test plan is now in operation for Ayrshires, Holsteins, and Jerseys. I sincerely hope that the Guernsey breed also will soon take this important step. Our Dairy Herd Improvement Associations are organized and con - ducted for a twofold purpose, the testing of cows and the proving of bulls. In connection with this work, we consider that a bull is proved after the production records of five or more of his unselected daughters have been compared with the production records of their dams. So far we have proved 638 dairy bulls through dairy herd improvement associa - tion records. But, sad to say, only eighty-five of these bulls were alive at the time they were proved. There isn't much use in proving a dead bull. Two of these 638 bulls were proved in Nebraska cow testing associa - tions. One of these was rather an outstanding bull. His six daughters have an average butterfat production of 402 pounds and the dams had an average butterfat production of 298 pounds. The daughters, there - fore, excelled their dams by 104 pounds of butterfat per cow, or 34.8 per cent. Better than all else, every daughter excelled her dam. I wish Nebraska had one thousand living purebred dairy bulls of this kind. There is, however, a dark side to this picture; both of these Ne - braska bulls were dead at the time they were proved. The one whose </seg>
            <seg id="p291">L NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION cord I have just given was sent to the butcher at the age of six years. The owner, said that the bull was sent to the butcher because he was hard to handle. After a dairy bull is proved by means of Dairy Herd Improvement. Association records, we always sent out a questionnaire to the state.' This questionnaire is sent on to the owner, who, ordinarily, fills.it out in full. One of the questions asked is regarding whether the bull is still alive. If the answer is "no," the farmer will fill out the next ques - tion telling why the bull was disposed of. In answer to this question, we get quite a variety of answers. One farmer said that he disposed of the bull because, of the danger of inbreeding, that all the calves were bull calves; another said he disposed of the bull because the bull was homely, and still another farmer in answer to the question as to how he disposed of the bull said "he died of eating nails." The proving of these six hundred dairy bulls has given us some very interesting figures. The figures show that the daughters of one - third of the bulls produced less than their dams, that the daughters of another one-third produced slightly more than their dams, and that the big gains in production come from the other third. A further study of the figures shows that all the purebred bulls mated with cows whose average production was under two hundred pounds of butterfat per cow increased the production of the daughters as compared with their dams. About 85 per cent of the bulls mated with cows whose average production was between 200 and 299 pounds of butterfat increased the production of the daughters over that of their dams. About 70 per cent of the dairy bulls mated with cows whose average production ranged between 300 and 399 pounds of butter - fat a year increased the production of their daughters, as compared with that of their dams. Less than fifty per cent of the dairy bulls that were mated with cows, whose average butterfat production was 400 or more, increased the production of the daughters as compared with their dams. These figures show that it is very, difficult to select bulls to improve high producing dairy herds. In fact, when the average production of the dairy herd gets above 300 pounds of butterfat a year per cow about one bull in three is likely to lower the production of the. herd, provided the bulls are selected on the basis of pedigree and conformation. After the dairy herd has reached an average close to 400 pounds, the chances are about even that the next dairy sire purchased on the basis of pedigree and conformation will actually lower the production of the herd. I believe that I may safely say that no living man is able, on the basis of pedigree and conformation, to select a satisfactory sire </seg>
            <seg id="p292">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE with any great degree of certainty to head a herd of dairy cows whose average production is above 400 pounds of butterfat a year. ' . Some of the bulls among the six hundred mentioned are very out - standing. For example, one dairy bull in the State of Vermont had fifteen daughters. On an average, those fifteen daughters produced 545 pounds of butterfat a year, or 159 pounds per cow more than their dams. The dams were all high producers, the lowest producing dam having produced 314 pounds of butterfat in a year. One of the bright points in this story is that every one of the fifteen daughters excelled a high producing dam; The records of the ancestors of this bull were excellent and gave a promise of what this bull might do in the way of increasing production, but the record of the fifteen daughters that excelled high producing dams was a fulfillment of that promise. If I were choosing a dairy bull to head a high producing dairy herd I would rather know the production records of his first ten daughters and the production of their dams than to know the production records of his dam and two grand - dams, and the production records of all his sisters, his cousins, and his aunts. More than three thousand years ago a wise man called Moses stood on a mountain top and viewed- the promised land, a land flowing with milk and honey. Today, every wise, up-to-date, progressive dairy farmer in Nebraska may look forward to that time when this great state will literally be a dairy land flowing with milk and money. In that great day all the dairy cattle in Nebraska, except the very young animals, will be tested for tuberculosis and infectious abortion. All the dairy cows will be proved or partially proved by comparing the pro - duction records of his daughters with the production records of their dams. MR. DAFT': I am certain that we are grateful to Dr. McDowell for this splendid talk. A few records- may not be of much importance, but when records are collected as they are in his office by the thousands and hundreds of thousands, we cannot ignore their significance and I am sure that every statement he made regarding the value of cow testing and dairy herd improvement association records will be carried home by the dairymen of Nebraska and as far as possible will be put into practice. -Before I introduce the next speaker, I want to take just a moment for other announcements. I want to announce the meeting of the Nebraska Dairy Development Society which will take place in this room tomorrow morning. I would suggest to all of you who are within driving distance and who are driving home this evening, that you be sure to drive back tomorrow morning and be here by ten o'clock to hear the opening address of Mr. Carl Gray, President of the </seg>

When this society was organized something like five years ago, I don't know who was responsible for the movement that was made, but surely placing the responsibility of leadership of that organization with such an outstanding character as Carl R. Gray had a great deal to do with the success of the enterprise. He has given much of his valuable time and assistance to the organization. The society has a large membership and it is doing an outstanding piece of work in the State of Nebraska. It cooperates with the Dairy - men's and Breed Associations and is doing everything to bring about better conditions in dairying. Not only Mr. Gray will speak, but also Dean Larsen of the South Dakota Station and Dean H. L. Russell of the College of Agriculture of the State of Wisconsin are on the program. I am sure that the Nebraska Dairy Development Society will present a program which may even rival our own in the importance of the ; men. who will be on the program and the messages they will have to deliver. It will be worth while for all of you to attend the meeting. Everyone who is at all familiar with dairy literature and who recognizes the names of men who have been leaders of the dairy industry, will be familiar with the name of our next speaker. Dr. C. H. ] Eckles, who is the head of the Dairy Department of the University of Minnesota, is known, I am sure, by name to all of you. Perhaps, like myself, you have never had the pleasure of meeting him face to face before. I am proud to present him to the Nebraska dairymen at this -time, and proud to present them to him. We will hear from Dr. Eckles. DR. ECKLES: Nothing arouses our ambition to succeed more effectively than association •wipi successful men in our line of work. It does all of us good once in a while to get far enough away from our job to see how it looks at a distance. Burns, that great poet of the farm and the common people, expressed this thought when he wrote: "O wad some Pow'r the giftie gie us To see qurselves as others see us." • Some American expressed the same thought in a cruder way by remarking: "It would be a good thing for every man if he could sit on the fence and watch himself go by." Burns did not tell how to "see ourselves as others see us." He merely expressed the desire that we could do so. A more practical type of man could not express the idea so effectively, but would go to work to accomplish the end. He would get away from home occasionally. He would visit others engaged in his own line of work and by observation, conversation, and reading </seg>

A visit abroad is well . worth while from this standpoint. It is quite true that conditions are so different that very little of immediate use can be brought home. Twenty-five years ago I spent a year abroad as a student of dairying in Germany and Switzerland. This past summer I visited England, Scotland, and Ireland, studying the dairy and agricultural situation. One does not bring home many ideas that can be at once put into use. We have not changed our dairy methods to any extent as a result of my recent visit. Such experiences, how - ever, do give a person a broader view of the dairy industry and I can see some of our own problems more clearly. I can see' the weakness of some of our methods. I can to some extent see ourselves as others see us. . The World's Dairy Congress met in London during June and July of last year. The last Congress of this kind met in the United States in 1923. In London it was a gathering of about 1600 representing forty-eight different countries. Programs were given in London at the University of Reading; in Edinburgh, Scotland, and at the Royal Agri - cultural Show at Nottingham. Although the programs were interesting, the most valuable features of the occasion were the excursions arranged for each afternoon. These excursions made possible visits to all sorts of dairy enterprises. We saw the equipment and practices of numerous farms, some operated by tenant farmers, some were great estates owned by members of the upper classes where the supervision was in the hands of a superintendent or baliff as he is termed. We visited various types of schools, especially those for agricultural instruction and research. Our journey also took us into the cheese making districts of England and Scotland and to the creameries of Ireland. Use of Milk in Great Britain The program of the World's Dairy Congress emphasized especially the use of. milk m the trama.iv dtet- 11 Vs.

As a matter of fact the use of fluid milk in England is low — less than half the amount per capita used m the \5iuted States and our country by no means ranks first in this respect. The use of milk by adults is practically unknown in England except in tea or coffee. I ate at many hotels and eating places of one kind and another in England, Scotland and Ireland, but never once did I see milk on the menu or see anyone drinking milk except in) a dairy lunch operated in London by a dairy company. If the consumption of milk </seg>

I . • could be doubled in England it' would unquestionably mean much to the health standards of the people and certainly would be of far reach - ing benefit to agriculture. One reason why more milk is not consumed is clear. The quality of the produce offered the consumer has not until recently been such as to encourage the use of any more than really is necessary. A visit to Britain causes us to realize quickly how fortunate our city population is regarding a safe and satisfactory milk supply. At the same time we will fully admit plenty of chance for improvement in our own. The well-informed Englishman does concede one thing re - garding the United States, and this is the superiority of our milk supply. In England the question of the bottling of milk for retain is a question of the hour. In London about 70 per cent of the milk is now sold in bottles, in many smaller towns practically none. The same may be said regarding pasteurization of city milk supplies. The proportion of milk pasteurized in London has increased from 20 per cent in 1917 to 85 per cent in 1927. In London, however, it should be said the lead in improving the milk supply is being taken by two or more very large companies who are following methods essentially the same as those practiced by the best milk distributors in the United States. The same is true of a magnificent cooperative plant in Belfast, Ireland. The milk plant machinery used in Britain is chiefly either of American manufac - ture or clearly an imitation of American equipment. The cooling of milk is often very inefficiently done in the dairies where it is produced. Ice is almost unknown. Until recently the use of chemical preservatives was allowed by law* and probably the use of such products is still practiced more or less. I . .'..'■■) The Tuberculosis Situation Unless pasteurization is required it perhaps is just as well that ■nffl*. toM.Miwp'&amp;'yfc Va tw&gt; \atget on account oi ft\e dec\defi\y wniavoT&amp;tfte situation regarding tuberculosis.

Apparently close to half the total number tested react on first test. Animals are rejected from dairy herds only when they show clinical symptoms. </seg>
            <seg id="p296">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Increased Use of Milk in America In connection with the use of milk for food, let me point out an astonishing' thing that has happened in the United States within recent years. The per capita consumption of milk has increased over 28 per cent within a little over ten years. We scarcely realize the significance of this statement at once. Let us put it. in another way. The increased consumption of milk is almost equal to the combined product of the dairy cows of Nebraska plus the product of our million and a half cows in Minnesota. Imagine the situation the dairymen would face if the use of milk should over night slip back to the level of consumption in 1917. There are probably several factors concerned in this increase in our own country, one of which is the efforts made to give the people a safe and satisfactory milk supply. In contrast to Britain, we have dared to face the tuberculosis situation. Our milk distributors have adopted up-to-date methods of handling milk. The dairymen of the country have accepted regulations regarding the sanitary production of milk with reasonable grace. One result has been public confidence in our product, making possible this astonishing increase in the use of milk. Cheese in Great Britain There are no butter or cheese factories in England or Scotland. Large quantities of cheese are made in both England and Scotland, but exclusively on farms. Why the factory system has not developed, especially in Ayrshire, Itcannot understand. The English are large consumers of cheese — using much more than we. The typical Englishman eats cheese at least once a day. The quality of the cheese is excellent. They are as far ahead of us in the quality of cheese on the market as we are ahead of them in the way of supplying cities with good milk. Much of the cheese we use in this country would be practically unsalable in England. ■ Butter and Ice Cream in England Small quantities of butter are made under farm conditions mainly for local or family use. As is well known, England is supplied with butter from New Zealand, Denmark, Ireland, Australia, and some conies from Siberia. The price of butter in England ranges lower than here. Much of the time the difference is close to the amount of our tariff on butter, that is, 12 cents per pound. Delegates from New Zealand, Denmark and Australia expressed themselves with decided bitterness regarding the American tariff wall which keeps out their product. </seg>
            <seg id="p297">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION Ice cream as is generally known is chiefly an American product. With us it is a decidedly important part of the dairy business. In Europe the use of ice cream is just beginning. It is available now in nearly all hotels and eating places, but the consumption is small, al - though increasing from year to year. The quality usually is hardly what we would consider first class. - ■ Butter Making in Ireland Ireland is a surplus butter country. The Irish Free State has 231 creameries, all cooperative, or at least soon all will be. In addition there are 307 skimming stations. The whole milk is delivered to the factory, separated with power machines, and the skim milk taken back to' the farm. No creamery is allowed to receive cream. Considerable quantities of the skim milk are used for human food, but the bulk goes to raise bacon pigs, for which Ireland is famous. The butter is made from pasteurized sweet cream, using essentially the same methods and type of machinery as we use in Minnesota for our best grade of butter. The government of the Free State supervises the creamery industry carefully, as it likewise does many other activities. Each creamery is required to send a tub of butter to the central control station at Dublin whenever called for by the officer in charge. When I visited the control station 225 tubs were on hand. This butter is scored and analyzed, kept for six weeks and again examined. Any defects that appeared are corrected for the future if possible by send - ing an inspector or instructor to the plant from which the butter came. Some folks complain of governmental regulation of business in the United States, but we are not in the same class with the young Irish Free State. The government is now making a survey of the country in regard to the need for creameries. If it is decided a certain locality seems to need a creamery one is organized by the government directed to take their milk to the one. which remains. If a certain one is closed, after compensation to be sure, and the farmers are locality needs but one where two are now competing for business, and the money furnished on long time and easy terms to build and equip the factory. The color of pigs 'is also regulated by government regulation, only white pigs are allowed. The purpose is to have a uni - form quality of bacon. English Agriculture To. understand English agriculture one must recall one or two facts from the past. Farming in England was prosperous about seventy or eighty years ago. Most of the food for the nation was produced at home. Then, beginning around 1840, came the opening of the great </seg>
            <seg id="p298">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE prairie regions in the United States. Illinois, Iowa, Nebraska, parts of Wisconsin, Indiana and Minnesota, and later the Dakotas and Western Canada, bringing into cultivation within a few years immense areas of extremely fertile soil. The whole world was flooded with cheap food. Agriculture was nearly ruined in England. Gfains could be brought from abroad cheaper than they could be raised at home. As a result England almost quit growing ordinary grain crops and more and more turned their lands into pastures. England looks like a great pasture or rather a series of hundreds of pasture fields. Sometimes one may travel two miles without seeing a piece of cultivated land. The pastures are magnificent, thanks largely to the climate and well distributed rainfall. I do not consider the English farmer especially good as a grower of crops. To see the finest examples of growing cultivated crops one should visit Germany. The English and Scotch are, however, great livestock producers. They excel in this line as do the Germans in growing crops. Never have I seen livestock of such uniform high quality, magnificent horses, cattle, sheep and hogs. Seldom does one see stock in England or Scotland that show lack of proper care and feed. Crossing and mixing breeds, that too common but destructive practice so often seen with us, is unknown in England except where meat animals may be produced for the market. When one sees the care and skill shown with live - stock it is easy to understand why nearly all the breeds of improved livestock that have spread outside their native home originated in England. Cattle in England The typical cattle of England and Ireland are the Milking Short - horn and magnificent animals they are. No matter how strongly one may be for the special dairy breeds in this country, he will admire the English Dairy Shorthorn. As a matter of fact I saw thousands of such animals in England equal to probably the best fifty I ever saw in the United States. I have said that if a township or a county in our dairy belt was once stocked exclusively with such animals as the English Milking Shorthorn I doubt if any other breed could make any inroads upon them. The average production of Milking Shorthorns tested in Milk Record - ing Associations — our Herd Improvement Associations — appears to be between 7000 and 8000 pounds yearly. The test of the milk is not taken and therefore no records of fat production are available, but assuming an average fat percentage of 3.8, the fat production of these Milking Shorthorns is about 266 pounds per year, or only slightly below the average of our Herd Improvement Associations. A small number of </seg>
            <seg id="p299">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION Jersey and Guernsey cattle are found in England, bat so few that the ordinary traveller does not see them at all. In recent years Friesian cattle, our Holstein Friesian, have been imported into England from Holland and are meeting with considerable favor. The numbers are as yet too small to be of any significance. Limited numbers of other native breeds like the Red Polls, the Devon, the Lincoln Reds, contribute to the milk supply to some extent. Income of the English Farmer The English farmer complains as bitterly of his present financial situation as does the American farmer. I was unable to see why he is not in as favorable a situation as the American farmer, unless it be regarding taxes. Labor is cheap, but I believe none too efficient. A farm laborer in England receives from $7 to $10 per week without either dwelling house or board. The English farm laborer lives in a small rented cottage having with it usually a garden plot. For this he may pay about $1.00 a week. The English farmer last summer was receiving about $2.50 per hundred for milk, which happened to be almost exactly the same as paid the milk producer around the Twin Cities in my state. This milk retails in the city for about 12 cents per quart, practically the same as in many of our cities. While labor is cheap in England, it takes lots of it to get things done. This may be the fault of the manage - ment as much as of the laborer. For example, in one hay field I saw seven men and two horses working. The hay. was mainly rye grass and I concluded the value of the hay had it been in this country would not equal the labor cost of making it. All English hay is stacked out - doors. It is said that hay cannot be kept in a barn. The high humidity of the atmosphere is the cause of this condition. . I was surprised to learn of the comparative low price of land in England. I was told several places that the usual selling price is about fifteen times the annual rental value, which is putting the value on a 6 per cent income basis. I found what appeared to be quite good land within a few miles of a city could be bought' for $75 per acre. This land rented for about $5 per acre. This suggests to me that in the future we are likely to come more and more to think of the value of land in these same terms, that of a fair capitalization of the average income. I ■ ' • Pastures in Great Britain The pastures are splendid in Britain. However, I am inclined to think the favorable climatic conditions are the chief reason. I did not see that anything special was being done to keep the pastures in con- </seg>

            <seg id="p302">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE dition. In Ireland I saw even finer pastures than in England. In August the conditions were equal if not better than our best pastures in the first part of June. The whole system of British agriculture is based upon pasture. While speaking of pastures it might be well to mention some interesting developments of recent years. On account of the importance of pasturing, the experiment stations and the most progressive farmers are giving considerable thought to the possibilities of improvement. Some astonishing results have been secured from using a system of intensive grassland management started about war times. At the Kil - marnock Dairy School in Scotland I saw sixty-five dairy cows, mostly Ayrshires, being maintained on forty-two acres of grass land. Grain was fed only to cows milking fifty pounds per day or more. The animals were in excellent condition. The forty-two acres were divided into six fields. The cows were grazed four days in turn on each of these fields. Immediately after they were taken off a field a harrow was run over it to spread the droppings. The entire pasture is heavily fertilized each year with commercial fertilizer of which nitrogenous fertilizers make up the greater part. An expenditure of over $5.00 per acre per year is made for fertilizers, but the results are astounding. I doubt if the same system could be followed in our Central States on ac - count of the uncertainty of our rainfall during the pasturing season. In Great Britain, while the rainfall is not excessive, it is well distributed and falls gently at frequent intervals. The very moderate temperature also results in less evaporation of moisture. New Zealand, one of our potential competitors in the world's dairy markets, is interested in this grass land system and experiments are being started to test the system there. The English and Scotch experiment stations are now investigating another important angle of the forage question, two of them in fact. At Cambridge University experiments have shown the possibility of making a concentrate meal from young grass. Grass is cut. when about four inches high and dried artificially, and the dry substance pressed into cakes. Experiments show this cake is equal to linseed meal as a feed for livestock. Good results have been obtained with this as the sole concentrate in the ration. The labor cost is so far prohibitive, but this may be solved in the future. It is quite possible we may in the future be cutting some of our alfalfa when about half grown and drying it artificially. There is no question regarding the quality of such feed. ■ . It had been, known for generations by practical livestock men in England that certain pastures are better than others. Some are known for their special value in fattening animals, sheep for example. Such </seg>
            <seg id="p303">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION differences in the value of pastures are recognized to some extent in our country. For example, in one place in West Virginia it is the experience that animals do much better on one side of the mountains than on the other. An investigation is now under way in Britain to determine the cause of these variations in feeding values. Results of far reaching effects are already forthcoming. It is becoming clearer that the value of grass or hay for example varies considerably with the composition of the grass which in turn goes back to the nature of the soil on which it was produced. We have all noticed that cattle will graze certain spots in the pasture closely while others are almost untouched. These English investigators are studying the reasons for the difference in palatability of the grass in such cases and are in a fair way to explain the cause. Evidence is accumulating to indicate that not only the mineral content of roughage may vary with the character of the soil, but the protein content as well. It is not at all a wild guess to predict that in the future alfalfa hay will be valued in connection with the type of soil on which it was produced. In the future land will be fertilized not merely to produce larger crops, but with the kind of fer - tilizer needed to produce roughage with the most desirable composition for feeding purposes. Use of the Silo in England Although the silo is of European origin, it has found the widest use in America, largely on account of its adaptation for preservings the corn crop. I had read considerable about stack silage in England and expected to find the method in use. I learned, however, that this plan did come into use somewhat about thirty years ago, but was finally discarded as unsatisfactory. In recent years the round silo as used in America is being tried in England and its value for preserving various crops determined. Corn is not grown in England. The crops now being used for silage are chiefly a mixture of beans, oats and vetch. Splendid yields are reported at various experiment stations and a conviction seems to be growing that the silo has a place in English agriculture to preserve the present crops or others which may be sub - stituted and to replace the practice of hay making, which is difficult on account of the unfavorable weather. The Royal Show The annual exhibition of the Royal Agricultural Society is recog - nized as one of the great shows of the world. The location is moved from year to year, resulting necessarily in quarters that are largely temporary and somewhat inadequate in comparison with our major state fairs. The Royal is a great show, comparing favorably with the </seg>
            <seg id="p304">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE best of our state fairs as an all around show and with our national shows in quality of livestock. I was especially interested in the methods of conducting the show. Although I had visited the Royal about twenty- . five years ago, I had largely forgotten these details. The judging of livestock is all done the first day, when three or four breeds of cattle may be out in open air rings at the same time. The admission the first day is $2.50, decreasing day by day until the last day the admission is 25 cents. One of the finest things about the livestock show is that it is con - ducted for the public and not for the exhibitors as is the tendency with us. When the judging is completed the animals are returned to the barns and each group arranged in the' order they were placed in the show ring from the first to the fifth. No blankets are allowed. For example, any time during the fair the public can see the aged cows in any particular breed lined up in the sheds in the order they were placed in the show ring and without being covered with blankets from their head to their tail as is generally the case in our barns. Probably a hundred times as many people see the animals and get some value from the results when such a plan is followed. At our typical state fair it is hardly worth while trying to look over the cattle unless you happen to be there when the judging is done. The English Royal is conducted without any amusement features on the grounds and still appears to have a good attendance. I think I am right in saying the Royal gets no support from the Government. The Society behind it certainly deserves great credit. The Royal Agricultural Society of Ireland Speaking of fairs, I wish to mention the most astonishing thing in this line that came to my attention. I refer to the Royal Agricultural Society of Ireland. This organization, without any Government financial assistance, has done remarkable things. It has a membership running into the thousands. On the outskirts of Dublin . it has a splendid Ex - hibition Grounds where one of the greatest horse shows of the world is held, having over 900 entries this year. This agricultural society functions in many ways. It has a splendid building larger than the typical university building, which serves as a club house. In this is also maintained one of the best libraries in Ireland. On the occasion of my visit I judge at least twenty people were using the library. A valuable collection of paintings is also maintained in this building. A general lecture course is held each year for the members. Financial Conditions in England England is still in bad financial condition and recovery apparently &gt;s slow if it is progressing at all. About one and a quarter million </seg>
            <seg id="p305">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION workmen are receiving the so-called "dole," a payment from the govern - ment during a period of non-employment. A workman who cannot get work is entitled to 16 shillings, about $4.00 per week, with some addi - tions in proportion to the size of his family. As a matter of fact some of them obtain almost as much income as does the man who is employed. It is idle to say these men should not be helped. Without help their families would actually starve. There is no joke about non-employment in England. I visited the coal producing locations in Yorkshire. Here the miners had not been working more than two days a week for two or three years. Without government assistance many would actually suffer for food. Now many families are living, or rather existing, on an income of less than $7.00 per week. The coal companies can not find a market for the coal and are operating at a loss now. A recent Government Commission, after studying the situation, reported no relief is in sight and recommended the migration of 200,000 miners with their families to the Dominions, that is, Canada, South Africa and Australia. So anxious is the English government to get the surplus labor out of the country that a person can migrate to Canada practically at the expense of the Government. But even this does not attract many, as the industrial workers are unhappy when thrown into agriculture in Canada and the dissatisfaction of those who have gone to the Dominions tends to prevent any large increase in the numbers going. All England is groaning under an enormous tax burden. Many of the large estates which have been for generations a conspicuous feature of English agriculture are being broken up for financial reasons, more often as the result of excessive taxes. The inheritance tax, or "death rates" as they are called, are especially high. If the title to an estate is transferred by death the new owner usually is able to borrow enough to pay the taxes, but if the title is transferred by death a second time within a few years the property is liable to be lost on account of the inability of the new owner to raise sufficient money to pay the taxes. In Great Britain the license fee for an automobile is a pound, practically $5.00, per horse power. A license fee for a Ford car, for example, costs over $100 a year. Gasoline is taxed 9 cents per gallon, the cost, including tax, last summer was 36 cents. The number of automobiles in proportion to the population is less than one-fourth the number in the United States. Many of those in use are extremely small, ranging from 7 to 10 horse power. Users of radio sets pay $5.00 a year license fee, which goes to pay for the programs put on by the Government. A visit to other lands at least serves the useful purpose of bring - ing home to us the high standard of income and living enjoyed in the </seg>
            <seg id="p306">1 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE United States. Even, although the American farmer is not getting his full share at present, the typical farmer in the United States lives in a way that would look like the next thing to heaven by millions of people in Europe. Conditions in Ireland Ireland is a beautiful country. I can understand why it is called the Emerald Isle. Never have I seen such beautiful green grass. Long grassy slopes dotted with small whitewashed cottages make a pictur - esque sight. However, when one learns the income of the people and the necessary standard of living the beauty of the landscape recedes and is replaced by visions from memory of corn and alfalfa lands with well-equipped country homes, with an income making possible luxuries absolutely unknown to the citizens of the Irish Free State. The average sized farm in Ireland is about thirty-nine acres and it is chiefly in grass and potatoes. Farm labor is paid from $5 to $7 per week, not including house and board. At the time of my visit the Irish farmer was receiving about $1.50 per hundredweight for his milk. His pigs brought about the same as ours or a little more. I visited several Irish creameries, but in no single case did I see milk delivered by an automobile or truck. Most of the hundreds of cans I saw de - livered were brought to the factory one or two at a time on a heavy twc-wheeled cart drawn by a little donkey or pony so small that a man could easily lift it off the ground. In most cases the driver who walked at the side was a boy or an old man or woman who could no longer work otherwise. The number of automobiles in these days is a fairly gocd index to the prosperity of a people. • In Ireland you can drive gration, mostly to America, is the explanation. Unless more industrial on the chief public roads, well built and kept up, without passing a private auto more than once in half an hour. The Irish people seem optimistic and reasonably happy. It is surprising to learn that the population of Ireland is only about one-half what it was in 1850. Emi - development occurs it seems to me Ireland would be better off with an - other million decrease in population. The farm of thirty-nine acres, mostly in grass, even with good climate and soil, cannot mean a satisfac - tory income. Agricultural Education Great Britain has a number of world famous universities, the best known of which are Oxford and Cambridge. I took the opportunity of visiting both of these magnificent institutions. These universities were established about 800 years ago. The buildings in use date mostly from between 1400 and 1600. In number of students they rank with bur medium sized universities, having an enrollment of about 5000 each. </seg>
            <seg id="p307">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION At Cambridge is developed a strong agricultural faculty of seventy members engaged in teaching 1 and research for agriculture. From Cam - bridge has already come the best knowledge available regarding repro - duction in cattle. Important contributions have also been made to the science of nutrition or feeding of livestock. Shortly before the war the English Parliament, becoming convinced of the need of more technical education, granted funds for a number of new universities, mostly under the supervision of cities which provide a part of the financial support. Some of these give instruction of a character fundamental to agriculture. The University of Reading is the only cne giving special attention to dairying. The University of Edinburgh has made significant contributions in the past to the "world's knowledge regarding the breeding of livestock. The Irish Free State has reorganized its institutions for higher education. University College, Cork, is to be the center for higher instruction and research in dairying. A building is now under construc - tion which will be one of the finest in Europe devoted to the dairy industry. At the Albert Agricultural College, Dublin, is being developed general instruction in agriculture of a high grade. A number of vocational schools of different kinds are also available for the young person who wishes to learn agricultural practices. This is especially true for the dairy industry. There are several schools of this type, such as the British Dairy Institute, a splendid dairy school connected with the University of Reading. The Dairy School for the West of Scotland at Kilmarnoch is also well known and deservedly so. Excellent experimental work is also under way at this institution, especially regarding cheese making. The students at these schools are more than half young women. These dairy maids find employment on the larger farms and estates where they have charge of the milk and the manufacture of cheese or butter. Often the poultry is also under their care. They do not do the rilking. Experimental work in dairying, such as is done by our experiment stations is conducted by research institutes. Each institute works with but a single line of farming. The Research Institute for Dairying is at Reading where it works in cooperation with the University, although not connected with it. The equipment of these research institutes and their income is meagre compared to that of our experiment stations in this country. . More experimental work would be of great profit to English agriculture. </seg>
            <seg id="p308">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE MR. DAFT: I am sorry that Professor Eckles did not have time to give us all the material which he had prepared. However, I want to remind you that if you are members of the State Dairymen's Associa - tion you will receive our annual report in which the material will he' published in full. We will find that it often profits us if we can pause for a moment to look about us to see what our neighbors are doing and that is just what Professor Eckles has helped us to do this afternoon. I am sure that we have enjoyed with him this visit to the British Islands and the contrast of the methods employed there with those to which we are accustomed. I would be glad if all of you might remain with us for the remainder of the program. If has been suggested that we digress slightly from the printed order of the program and that we present the medals which go to the dairy herd improvement association members at this time and Mr. Flack will give us his talk after the pre - sentation is over and we shall be glad to have all of you stay for that talk. Mr. Flack, as you know, was one of those who accompanied our successful 4-H club judging team on its trip to England last summer. They not only visited England, but they visited the Channel Islands, the Island of Guernsey, the Island of Jersey, and were also in Holland and France and other European countries. All the members of that team are present and probably Mr. Flack will present them to us. I am going to pause to give honor to a man who is here as a visitor. I would be glad if we had time to give him a place on our program, but this is impossible. However, I could not pass the moment without a word of recognition to Mr. T. L. Haecker, who is here as a visitor to his son, Mr. A. L.' Haecker. I am sure we are glad to have him with us this afternoon. As I explained at the beginning of our meeting, one of the things which the Nebraska State Dairymen's Association attempts to do is to recognize at the end of the year those who have reached a certain goal which was set at the beginning of the year. Each year we award a trophy cup to the dairy herd improvement association which shows the highest average butterfat production for the year and, as I an - nounced, it was won in 1926 by the Lancaster Association and in 1927 by the North Platte Valley Association, frequently referred to as the Scottsbluff Association. We also award medals to all herds averaging three hundred pounds of butterfat or more with special medals to those of high production. Here are the averages for the twenty-three asso - ciations for the year 1928, and I am going to begin reading at the bottom: </seg>

Who is here as representative of this association? Will he please come forward at . this time. Mr. Leonard of Scottsbluff . Mr. Leonard, on behalf of the Nebraska State Dairymen's Association, I present to the North Platte Valley Association, for the second year in succession, the cup which is awarded by our association. MR. LEONARD: Gentlemen: I certainly wish to thank the Ne - braska State Dairymen's Association for awarding- this cup. We made a vain boast a year ago when we won the cup, and took it to our part of the state, that we would keep it in that part of the state for more than one year. We did not think at that time that we would do it, but we have. MR. DAFT: We believe that not only the man who milks the cow, but the fellow who visits him once. a month and helps clean out his barn and helps put in the feed and throw down the hay and milks the cows when the owner is away, and on top of all that, keeps an accurate record of production of each animal on the place, should do his work thoroughly and well and we established a custom last year of presenting a medal to the most efficient tester. This year there was a little more competition than there was last year. Last year there were sixteen contestants and this year twenty-three. The committee which had made this award makes the following report: </seg>
            <seg id="p310">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Mr. C. W. Hodgkins, tester in charge of the Seward- York-Polk Dairy Herd Improvement Association, was chosen by the committee as the most efficient tester for the year 1928, and will be awarded a medal by the Nebraska Dairymen's Association for this achievement. This award was based upon a score card prepared by the committee. Mr. Flack just explained to me that the man who won .the medal last year is not eligible for the medal this year. Will Mr. Hodgkins come forward. It gives me great pleasure to present this medal to you, Mr. Hodgkins. MR. HODGKINS: First I want to thank the members of my asso - ciation for their cooperation all the year to make this possible. If the association does not cooperate with the tester, he cannot get far. The association worked with me fine. Also, the county agent and the fellows at the college have taken lots of interest and helped lots. I wish also to express my appreciation for that. When I took the association two years ago, my greatest desire was to pass on some information to each member that would be valuable, and to keep complete and accurate records, and if I have done the job well enough to be deserving of this honor, I am very happy. Cow testing association work is educational and very interesting and any young man interested in agriculture can get a lot of mighty valuable background from a few years of this work. The breeders and farmers are a lot of mighty fine people and I would not hesitate to advise anybody to take up this work. Thank you very much. MR. DAFT: I will read the score card on which the efficiency of the tester is measured: • " Aid given to members (a) Selection of breeding stock (b) Selection of pure bred sires 10 Accuracy (a) Books and Reports 15 Neatness (a) Books and Reports 10 Promptness in finishing reports (a) Monthly : (b) Yearly : 10 Completion of Work (a) Monthly (b) Yearly 15 </seg>

This man, I was going to say this lucky man, but the word lucky would be a misnomer. The matter of winning medals is not a piece of luck. This efficient man, I should say. This man who has made a success of his dairy herd is no other than our good friend Mr. John Jacobsen of Mar - quette, Nebraska, and a member of the Hamilton-Merrick Association. He milks a herd of fourteen Holstein cows which had an average for the year of 470.5 pounds of butterfat. It is an honor to present this medal to you. We would be glad to hear a word from Mr. Jacobsen. MR. JACOBSEN: I am not a speechmaker. The only public speak - ing I have ever done has been in trying to get a team of mules across a mud hole with a stick. But first of all I will attribute my success to the Extension Service of the University of Nebraska. If it was not for the Extension Service of the University of Nebraska I would never have been able to have gotten this herd of Holstein cattle. Some years ago— about six or seven — I started in and I. was feeding cattle until that time. About that time I took down with the flu and became very sick and the disease left me in a lame condition so that it was very difficult for me to walk. Cattle had gone up in price and I talked to the county agent and asked what he thought about milk cows. I had never milked many cows. I didn't think much of cows, but read some in the papers about people making money from them. I asked him what he -thought and he said he thought it would be a good thing to get a few good milk cows. I did not know where to get them or what price to pay for them. The county agent told me that the University of Nebraska, the Extension Service, had a man who did this kind of work and that he would help me select the milk cows. Mr. Lawritson selected the foundation stock for my herd. Mr. Lawritson and our </seg>
            <seg id="p312">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE county agent, at that time Mr. Camp, helped me pick my herd sire. The sire happened to be the son of Beauty Girl at North Platte. At that time the herd did not have much of a record, for the daughters of this ' son are the ones that have produced this record. I think the sire of this herd is more than half the herd. And I think that I owe my success largely to the Extension Service of the University of Nebraska. Second, I think I owe my success largely to my wife. But, first of all, I think I owe my success to a partner that we carry with us day in and -day out, and that is our Lord Jesus Christ. I thank you. MR. DAFT: It) seems to me that it would be awfully hard to beat that combination of a good wife and a good bull and the Lord on our side. Now this man Jacobsen whose herd made such a fine record did not win by any long odds. We realized when we began awarding these medals that some placings would be pretty close and . in order not to leave out the other fellows we award a silver medal to the second high herd. This medal goes to Mr. O. E. Higgins of Stella, Nebraska. He belongs to the Nemaha-Richardson Association. His herd of eleven grade and purebred Holsteins produced an average for the year of 469.5 pounds of buttorfat. You will recall that Mr. Jacobsen's herd produced 470.5 pounds — just one pound between the two men. If Mr. Higgins will please come forward I will be glad to present him with the medal at this time. By the way, let me just suggest at this point that when I read the name, don't wait for me to call you to come for - ward. If Mr. Higgins is not here we will see that the medal gets into his hands and also the Nebraska State Dairymen's Association produc - tion certificate as owner of a herd that has qualified for the second time, as his herd qualified for the association medal in the years 1927 and 1928. We also want to pay special recognition to all the herds in the state in addition to the two presented with the gold and silver medals for first and second high average with an average of more than 450 pounds. There is one, C. H. Becker &amp; Son of Emerald. They belong to the Lancaster Association. Their herd of grade Holsteins for three years has produced over 450 pounds of butterfat. This year they pro - duced 459.0 pounds. Mr. Becker, some of us saw you last night. To those of you who were not there, I will explain. Mr. Becker is one of the farmers recognized by the Nebraska Farmer as one of the ten 1928 Master Farmers of Nebraska and this second honor comes to him as recognition of his efficiency as a dairy farmer and general help to his community and state as a whole. MR. BECKER: I just want to say a few words in regard to what Mr. Jacobsen said a few minutes ago. The sire is more than half the herd. This record that was made by our herd this year was from </seg>
            <seg id="p313">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION daughters of the herd that made 451 pounds two years ago. Thank you. MR.

I am going: to ask that these gentle - men distribute the production certificates and medals which go to these herds. If the men whose names are called will step forward, one of these gentlemen will hand you the medal. This is a list of herds in addition to the three previously recognized which have an average of more than 400 pounds butterfat for the year.

I am sure that the association appreciates the privilege which belongs to it in being able to award these medals and production cer - tificates. Now if the testers or the officers of the associations which have been read discover that through any possibility any name has been omitted, we would certainly appreciate having the matter called to our attention so that the proper recognition may be given to any name which might have been omitted. Mr. Flack suggests that we have our business session at this time and now he asks to be excused from showing his slides. He says that he -will have occasion to visit various parts of the state during the year and 1 - that he will be glad to bring these slides to any meeting and will </seg>
            <seg id="p323">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION be glad to show them at any time. (A list of the slides which were to have been shown by Mr. Flack will be found on page 62.) First we will have the report of the committee on resolutions, of which Bob McGinnis is chairman. Bob suggested to me last night that he believed in organization and suggested that he and I organize a bald - headed men's club. He will now read the report of the resolutions com - mittee: MR. McGINNIS: We, your Committee on Resolutions, beg to sub - mit the following report: It usually being the custom to embody commendations in this report on the officers serving during the year, we desire to offer the thanks of all dairymen of Nebraska to the officers for their splendid work, and also the program prepared, but desire to make special mention of the exceptional good work done by President Daft in securing an increase in premiums at the State Fair for the several dairy breeders. We also feel that the report would not be complete without making mention of the successful work done the past year by Professor M. L. Flack in the Dairy Herd Improvement Associations. We wish to commend the Extension Department and especially the Dairy Club Leaders for the interest they have taken in encouraging our young Four H Club Boys and Girls in this work. Respectfully submitted: R. W. McGinnis, Sumner Barnell, C. K. Morse. I move the adoption of the report Motion seconded. Gentlemen, you have heard the motion and the second that i the re - port as submitted be accepted. Is there any discussion? All in favor of the motion, signify by saying, "Aye." Motion carried. We will now have the report of the Nominating Committee, of which Mr. Putman of Crete- is Chairman. MR. PUTMAN: The nominating committee made nominations as follows: Mr. L. H. Daft, President; M. N. Lawritson, Vice President; L. K. Crowe, Secretary. Board of Directors: H. P. Davis, E. W. Frost, Vernon Andrews and Gilbert Eldredge and J. B. Higgins. MR. DAFT: Are there any other nominations? Please understand that the report of the nominating committee does not exclude nomina - tions from the floor. If there are any other nominations, they are in order at this time. </seg>
            <seg id="p324">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE MR. CLARK: Mr. Chairman, I move that the nominations be closed, and that we cast a ballot for the report of the nominating committee ' just read. It is embarrassing for your presiding officer to put this motion through. I move that nominations be closed and that the secre - tary be instructed to cast a unanimous ballot for these nominees. Motion seconded and carried. MR. DAFT: Gentlemen, I cannot dismiss you without expressing a word of appreciation for the confidence which this re-election carries with it. Last year when I was elected, even though I had been on the board of directors, I found that there were a lot of activities of this organization with which I was entirely unfamiliar. This year has been a very happy one. I have had splendid cooperation from the Board of Directors, not only of our own association, but have had the unselfish cooperation of the breed associations of the four major dairy breeds, the Nebraska Dairy Development Society, the Extension Department and the Dairy Department of the College. Mr. Frisbie, who is club work director, has been one of our right-hand men. It has seemed this past year that every organization interested in dairying at all has cooperated in a splendid way to bring about the things we have accom - plished. We have not done everything we would like to. I am sure that the board of directors you have selected will carry forward the program which has been started. I want to mention one thing that is a disappointing feature of these meetings, an event we have grown to look forward to with a great deal of pleasure. About five years ago the Livestock Breeders invited the Dairymen to join them in holding an annual banquet during these meet - ings, which was always held on Thursday night. This has existed for five years and, as far as our association was concerned, was very satis - factory. We discovered at the very last hour that, at a meeting held last April, the Board of Directors of the Livestock Breeders decided they would hold the banquet alone this year. The announcement came to us at such a late time that we were unable to prepare the kind of a banquet that the dairymen of this state would put on. So this year we are obliged to abandon entirely the Dairymen's Association banquet. While the report of the election was unknown to us, we were prepared to recommend to the Board of Directors that we plan already for the Dairymen's banquet for another year, and at that banquet we present the medals that we have presented here this afternoon. If there is no further business, the meeting is adjourned. Title of European Slides 1. Views taken by members of 4-H club group while on their trip to England.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY In the address of your president in the fore part of this annual report you will find a general summary of the work accomplished by this association during the past year. It seems unnecessary to go into this in more detail, but in as much as nothing has been given regarding the expenditure of the funds of the association, the budget for the fiscal year, July 1, 1928, to June 30, 1929, is presented below: Supplies, printing, stenographic labor .$16000 State and county fair exhibits 600.00 Boys' and girls' clubs, dairy herd improvement associations, dairy demonstration team, and high school contests and awards . . . 265.00 University dairy judging teams 100.00 Expenses of Board members to National Dairy Show 100.00 Expenses of Board members to meetings 100.00 Speakers for Organized Agriculture 125.00 Dairy and Livestock Banquet 50.00 The above budget has been followed very closely. However, it may be explained that the members of the Board have not reguested travel - ing expenses when attending meetings, and this year the dairy and livestock banquet was not held. Funds apportioned in the budget to these two items have been used to take care of the increased number 1 of awards in dairy herd improvement associations and for the prepara - tion of additional exhibit material for use at county fairs. The remainder of this report will be devoted to dairy information that- it is hoped will be of value to the man interested in dairy cattle directly or indirectly. How to Choose a Breed of Dairy Cattle Some factors that should be considered when answering the ever - present question — What breed of cows should I choose when starting a dairy herd? 1. Prevalent Breed in the Community. The breeder selecting: the breed that is already prevalent in the com - munity will benefit .in several ways: A. Community advertising benefits all, that is any and all adver - tising by groups or individuals for a certain breed will aid all that are interested in that breed. </seg>

            <seg id="p329"/>
            <seg id="p330">; REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE l. B. Easier sale of surplus stock to neighbors or to outside buyers. C. Breeding stock may be purchased readily. 2. Climatic and Feed Conditions. Since there is not a wide range in climate or feed conditions within this state, these factors should not be considered too seriously. Some breeds of dairy cattle are better suited to warm climates, some to colder climates. Some breeds will graze better than qthers and some are better adapted to conditions where liberal feeding is the practice. Where one breed may require a large proportion of concentrates to roughage, the reverse may be true with another breed in order to produce the same profit above feed cost. 3. Market Requirements for the Product. The percentage of butterfat in the milk, the cream line, and the color are usually important when selling milk. Usually those breeds producing milk with a high percentage of butterfat will produce a pound of butterfat cheaper. In those breeds ' where the percentage of butterfat is lower, usually a larger amount of milk is produced and the additional skim milk for feeding pur - poses tends to equalize the value of the product. 4. Personal Preference. Human nature is such that we make a greater success with the work that we personally favor. 5. Prevailing Price of the Breed. The market price of dairy cattle in any breed is not constant and the wise breeder will not buy foundation animals of any breed during a period of inflation. Compare the cost of individuals in one breed with individuals in another breed having the same production of butterfat. 6. Prepotency. The type of a breed should be well established. Compare also the effect of using purebred bulls of different breeds when bred to grade cows in building up a herd. 7. Estimated Future of a Breed. Color, family fads, etc., will usually retard the future of a breed. Beware of a breed with such tendencies.

BROWN SWISS Native Home — Northeastern part of Switzerland. Environment — The total area of Switzerland is about 15,900 square miles, of which about 71 per cent is productive. These cattle graze from sea level to the land of perpetual snow. They are housed in winter in poorly constructed stables, and fed on native hay, turnips, potatoes, and a small amount of grain and oil cake. In summer they are grazed at high altitudes, and protected from storms by- temporary open sheds. The Brown Swiss of America is the Schwyz of Switzerland. In their native home they are distinctly dual purpose and in addi - tion have been used for draft. In Switzerland these cattle have a production of about 10,000 pounds of milk testing 4 per cent of butterfat. Characteristics — - Color — Varies from dark to light brown, and at some seasons ap - proach grey and mouse color, usually a light stripe down the back and around the muzzle and eyes. White splashes are found near udder, but white on the sides or back is objectionable. Weight — Mature cows average 1300 pounds. Bulls, 1800 pounds. Disposition — Quiet, docile, easily handled. Weight of Calves — Average 75-90 pounds at birth and make rapid gain. . - Muturing Qualities — Heifers should be bred to freshen at 30-34 months, as they are a slow maturing breed. Type of Udder — The breed has been criticized for lack of regularity in type of udder. Characteristics of Milk — Large fat globules and more yellow color than Holstein or Ayrshire. Adaptation — They are utilized for both milk and beef production in native home, but have been bred for milk production in thi3 country. They are good grazing cattle and well suited to our northern states. </seg>

            <seg id="p344">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Omaha, February 1, 1929. To the Membership of the Nebraska Dairy Development' Society: With the close of the calendar year 1928 the first five-year period for which this Society was chartered and financed comes to an end. A review of the conditions surrounding the dairy industry in Nebraska at the beginning of that period and at the present time is most heartening. While there has been an appreciable increase in the number of milk cows, the remarkable increase in production per animal is the real criterion. Detection and elimination of the unprofitable cow is fundamental; and along with this is the important factor of equipment, and the proper cai-e of the dairy animal. Initially, the Society moved with caution and deliberation. Farmers were not encouraged to attempt wholesale opera - tions, but rather to commence with small herds and to develop to larger activities only as their methods proved successful and their surroundings and equipment favorable. Boys' and Girls' Calf Clubs and Herd Im - provement Associations have been organized and stimulated; their growth compares most favorably with that in any state, although much remains to be done. Nebraska is rapidly . becoming "dairy minded," and the steady growth of the butter and cheese production is further evidence of this attitude. Experience has shown that the Nebraska standard should be the 300-pound butter fat cow. Such an animal returns $96.00 per annum over feed cost, contrasted with $14.00 for a 100-pound cow. This is graphically shown by the chart on page 14. It is the Society's object to attain this standard, and in pursuance of this objective it has adopted a new slogan: BETTER COWS, BETTER CARED FOR! Following the action of the membership at. the annual meeting in Lincoln on January 10th, arrangements are being made to extend the Society's charter for another five-year period and to properly finance the organization, in order that it may continue its activities. Your officers believe that its helpful purposes are now generally appreciated, as evidenced by the constantly increasing calls for advice and assist - ance; and they feel that we are in reality at the beginning of the Society's usefulness to the industry and to the State. With an honest pride in the progress of the last five years, we look forward with confident expectation to even greater accomplishment in the future. The report of the manager covering the details of the Society's operations during 1928 and for the five-year period is ap - pended, and the officers and trustees express their high appreciation of the work which Messrs. Liebers and Lawritson have performed. C. R. GRAY, President. </seg>

H. Liebers and Assistant Manager M. N. Lawritson attended 523 meetings for discussion of dairy subjects, 314 of a general character, 17 devdtcd to organization of dairy herd improvement associations, and 192 in the interests of boys' and girls' club activities. The attendance at these meetings exceeded 21,500 persons. They made in addition 602 individual farm visits on request, 203 in connection with herd improvement association work, 117 for instruc - tion to two hundred dairy calf club members in fitting, feeding and showmanship, and 192 for service in the handling of general dairy problems. The Society received 2;897 requests for information or assistance, cf which 1,335 were disposed of by correspondence, 964 by personal conference, and 598 by telephone. Its representatives secured 118 new herd improvement association members, placing 1,420 cows on test. The Society purchased 601 dairy animals for 258 Nebraska farmers, breeders and club members. Of this number, 155 were acquired from 49 Nebraska breeders. The cattle secured included 123 calves for club members, 426 cows and heifers for foundation stock, and 52 purebred sires. Of the last, 31 were purchased from Nebraska breeders, it having been necessary to buy only 21 bulls outside the state, two Hol - steins and nineteen Guernseys. Continuing its policy of promoting concerted effort, the Society's representatives cooperated beneficially with the field agents in Nebraska of the American Guernsey Cattle Club, the American Jersey Cattle Club, and the Holstein-Friesian Association of America. Summary for 1924-1928 In the past five years the Manager and Assistant Manager have discussed dairy development at 1,448 meetings in 89 counties of the state, with a total attendance of nearly 280,000. They have made, on request, 3,314 farm visits, and rendered service to 14 4 777 persons in addition by office conference, correspondence, or telephone. They pur - chased for 1,042 Nebraska breeders, farmers and club members, an aggregate of 2,588 dairy animals, including 253 purebred herd sires, selected with extreme care for type and breeding, 540 club calves of good breed and dairy type from dams having production records of S00 pounds or more butterfat per annum,- the remainder being 1,818 cows </seg>

In making these purchases, it was possible to assist Nebraska breeders to the number of 211 in disposing of surplus breeding stock of acceptable type and grade, including 162 purebred bulls. Dairy Herd Improvement Associations During 1928 the Society, in conjunction with the Extension Dairy Specialist of the College of Agriculture and the County Agricultural agents, organized seven new herd improvement associations with 183 members, testing 1,509 cows. The seven new associations are located in Buffalo, Burt, Cass-Johnson-Otoe, Lancaster, Gage, Nemaha-Richard - son, and Scotts Bluff counties. In 1924 there were only two herd improvement associations in the state, with a membership of 61, testing 904 cows. The number had increased in 1928 to 23 associations, with '564 members, having 7,369 cows on test, an increase in number of animals of over 700 per cent in four years. • </seg>

            <seg id="p351">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION BOYS AND GIRLS DAIRY CALF CLUBS In 1928 the Society, in cooperation with the University Extension Department, organized 10 new dairy calf clubs, with 98 members. The number of these clubs has increased from 21, with 199 members, in 1923, to 73 clubs with 702 members in 1928, an increase of 250 per cent in five years. These figures do not adequately express the growth and development of club work in the state, because each year a number of the boys and girls complete their three-year projects, and many reach the age limit for club work and automatically drop out. One hundred and sixty-three dairy calves were exhibited at the 1928 State Fair, contrasted with but 15 in 1925. The official judge, Mr. E. G. Woodward of Taconic, Conn., praised the high quality of the calves, their fine condition, and the splendid skill and showmanship of the club members. From the beginning of its activities the Society has considered dairy calf club work one of the most effective means of development of the dairy industry on a sound and profitable basis. The 702 boys and girls engaged in this work throughout 42 Nebraska counties are doing more than any other factor in introducing dairy animals of correct type and breeding, and establishing successful methods of feeding and management in their respective communities." ■ Qrowth of Dairy Calf Club Work in Nebraska NUMBER OF MEMBERS 1923 HjUjJjJ : '-: : -,v-;L .1 ' ■ 1924 BSEEHZH 1927 K^UHHmHHHHH </seg>

Liebers and Lawritson, to Nebraska farmers and breeders, for the selection and purchase of dairy cattle, either grade or purebred. During the past year they have devoted three months' time to this phase of dairy de - velopment work, and, in addition to this personal service, have assisted many farmers by placing them in touch with breeders in the state who have surplus stock. The Society maintains a record of purebred herds in Nebraska, available to any desiring to acquire breeding stock. In filling orders for dairy cattle, it is the Society's policy to give preference to Nebraska breeders. No charge is made for service ren - dered except actual expense which is pro-rated to the purchasers. At every opportunity the Society has discouraged the importation into the state of inferior or unhealthy dairy stock. Nebraska will be materially benefited by the acquisition of. cows of good class, type and breed, to replace "boarders," and to build up the cow population to at j least five or six high producing cows on every farm. In doing so, it is | extremely important that quality be emphasized, and that the importa - tion of unprofitable stock be avoided. It is suggested that farmers and. breeders seeking dairy cattle communicate with any one of the following organizations which are able to advise them where they can secure good stock to the best ad - vantage: Nebraska Dairy Development Society, O.

            <seg id="p359">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION WHAT KEEPS DOWN THE SURPLUS By Dean H. L. Russell University of Wisconsin As Reported by Howard Bigger, Editor, Omaha Stockman Journal The subject assigned to Dean H. L. Russell of the University of Wisconsin for the Nebraska Dairy Development Society meeting at Lincoln the second week in January was, "What Keeps Down the Dairy Surplus." The Dean is one who is especially well fitted to handle such a subject for the reason that he has been intimately in touch with dairy work in the big dairy state of Wisconsin and in addition has taken fre - quent trips to other dairy states and to foreign countries where dairying is a prominent industry. At the outset Dean Russell stated that dairy production in this country has for several years been steadily increasing. This increase in production it is interesting to note has gone on in spite of the fact that there has been a decrease in the number of dairy cattle of the country. The statistics show that in the past three years there has been an actual decrease of 530,000 head of dairy cattle. This shows one thing very clearly and that is that the efficiency of the dairy cow is being increased. Herd Improvement Associations Dean Russell paid high tribute to the work of the herd improve - ment associations of- the - country, stating that they had been a very prominent factor in making for more production per cow. He said that there were two possible explanations of reasons why there as yet has ■ not been a dairy surplus in this country. One of these would be the fact that there has been a constant increase in the country's population, and the other is that there has been a stimulation to increased milk consumption. The increase in the population of the country must have some in - fluence of course for the reason that every year our population grows to the extent of something like one and a half millions. ■.... ■ The Farmer's Problem Dean Russell stated that he saw one reason why there was this problem of the surplus in connection with many of our agricultural products. That reason was that primarily the products of the farm are products which we consume on our tables. Mankind has for the most part always gotten along on three meals a day.' He does not particularly desire to increase his consumption of food. If he is urged to eat more </seg>
            <seg id="p360">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE of some one food product, then he must necessarily eat less of "some other product. But in the case of many of the industries, they handle materials which allow for' expansion. . The question of a house to live in is an example. The men who sell building materials are always assured that as man's wealth increases, though he may not eat more, yet he can live in a better house. He may start out living in a $5,000 or $6,000 home. His financial condition improves and sooner or later he will perhaps decide to live in a house costing $15,000 to $20,000 or even more. In, other words, as far as living is concerned, there is always the chance for expansion in his wants as regards a home. Or take the case of the industries which sell clothing materials. Man eats only three meals a day, but he does not restrict himself as regards dress. His wife may buy a Paris gown if his financial condition becomes increasingly better. He may have several suits of clothes instead of one or two. In other words, the man who sells clothing does not have such a restricted market as the farmer who produces food - stuffs. The automobile industry also differs from agriculture in that there has as yet been found no saturation point for automobiles. Folks said that there would be a saturation point in automobiles when every family had a car. But ■ long before that point was reached, many families were using two cars, and no one knows or would attempt to say when, if ever, there will be a saturation point as regards the automobile in - dustry. In other words, said Dean Russell, other industries have more than a food string to their bow. ' . Increased Milk Consumption That there has been an increasing milk consumption per capita is borne out by statistics on the problem. Since 1920 the average con - sumption of milk per capita has increased from 43 gallons to 55 gallons. There has also been an increase in the consumption per. capita of con - densed milk, cheese and butter! Dean Russell stated that the prohibition amendment no doubt had a good deal to do with it. ' In many of our great factories, where at noon the workmen would be seen drinking beer, now one sees them drinking milk. But that, in Dean Russell's opinion, is only in a small way responsi - ble for the increase in milk consumption. It has been borne in upon our people that milk is a great health food. More and more has been written and talked about with regard to the fact that milk contains the life-giving vitamines and the other essentials for health. Milk has been heralded as a cure for most of the so-called deficiency diseases. If one reads advertising today, particularly in the women's magazines, </seg>
            <seg id="p361">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION he is impressed with the fact that health and beauty are the two things which the advertiser tries to impress upon women. Value of Advertising That this boost for milk on the part of doctors, speakers and in the press, has had a big effect upon increasing milk consumption, is the belief of Dean Russell. As showing what boosting a foodstuff will do when advertising is brought into play, Dean Russell said that the Cali - fornia Fruit Growers' Association, in order to get rid of their cull oranges, began boosting the idea of orange juice as a drink. They sold extractors for use in the home and all over the country, establishments to sell- orange juice, have been set up. The value of this is seen in, the fact that last year 6,000 carloads of cull oranges were sold for making orange juice.

            <seg id="p377">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION . HOME ECONOMICS SECTION OF ORGANIZED AGRICULTURE The twenty-fourth annual meeting of the Home Economics Section of Organized Agriculture opened Tuesday, January 8, at 9:30 A. M. Mrs. S. P. Davis of Syracuse, president, presided. The program opened with music by Mrs. N. W. Gaines. She sang three numbers, "Bird Songs at Eventide," by Coates; "Thy Troubadour," by Walt; and "My Little Soul is Coin' to Shine," a negro spiritual. She was accompanied by Mrs. J. L. Thomas. Rev. Ervine Inglis of Vine Congregational Church pronounced the invocation. The president, Mrs. Davis, in her greetings said: . ■ "I am certainly happy to see so many of you here on. this opening morning. I know what some of you, perhaps all of you, have had to do in order to be here, because I have had to do the same things my - self. I started a year ago to plan to come to this meeting. There have been so many interruptions thru the year that I did not know whether I would get to come or not. I wonder if there is anywhere a home-maker who has not had many interruptions and had to make detours from her regular paths, before she was finally able to accom - plish what she started out to do, and so I know we are all most happy to be here and when we look to this program we wonder which day it would be best for us to come, and we decided we would have to come for all of it. "When I was elected to fill this place I felt so inefficient to do the work. But I know I would have been disappointed if I hadn't got to come and I wanted to help this meeting out and do my share if it was just as the same as the smallest cog in machinery. It is a very pleasant task — it isn't a hard task at all. The workers at the Agri - cultural College do all the work and all the president has to do is just to be here and read off the program. The work has all been done. What work has been done is worth the effort and enough help and strength will be received from the meetings to pay. "We need interruptions in our work. It is life's plan that we should have these little hesitations along the way. In climbing a mountain we have a very difficult path to get to the top and if we don't have these little detours, we would be out of breath long before we got to the top of the hill. For the little hardships we had to over - come,'we are glad to be here. We are going to have the best meeting we -have ever had, and this is the best meeting of any on the campus. Our organization is second to none. There is not a group of workers anywhere that needs this sort of thing any more than a home-maker. It is necessary that we should do the best that is in us and to think </seg>
            <seg id="p378">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE that our work is just as important as any other work. We should feel that our line of work is the most important that there is. "I am glad that the state has recognized the importance of our line of work and has given us some help. I am glad there is a place for our daughters to come and learn better ways of doing things. I am glad that we women have specialists who come to us and help us do our work better. When they teach us ' how to better clothe our family and feed our family better and more economically and help us to equip our homes so that they are more convenient and more attrac - tive they are helping us in this big job of home-making. "When we think of home-making we think of mothering and that is a big, big undertaking. It is so far reaching, and it is life long. It doesn't matter where any member of our family goes whether it is to the other side of the world, our walls at home reach out to the individual wherever he may be. The child will speak of going home. The dwelling is not the home. 'Home is where Ma is. 1 We know that the importance of father in the home is just as great and still the biggest part of the task seems to fall on the mother. The mother is with the children the most of the time, especially when they are tiny. The job is pretty far reaching — it is life long. No one gets so old that he does not need a mother. A mother's task reaches to the gates of heaven. Even if we have gone with our mother that far, our mother's influence will go with us until our task is done. A mother does not belong to any union, nor does she have an eight-hour day. Mother never watched the clock. The only ticking she ever pays any attention to is the ticking of her heart and she needs this until the last. "The safe guarding of our youth must come mostly from within. It is possible that we might legislate against certain things that would make this world safer for our children. It is woman's work to see that all of the good legislations that we can possibly have, we must have. And so whilq we can do a great deal in that direction, yet the greatest part must come from the training of the child in the home. If we could have all the legislation that we might wish, so that when our children left us we felt perfectly safe, I am afraid our young people wouldn't be happy. We are looking backwards and they are looking forwards. "I hope that aside from getting strength and help from all that we may hear from one another, I hope that aside from that, this meet - ing may bring to us sympathy and tolerance in this job of being a mother. We hear so much about tolerance in politics and religion, but we can have tolerance in this job of mothering. </seg>
            <seg id="p379">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION "When Christ walked the earth he selected twelve men to help him and carry on his work when he was gone, and after three years of close' association with Christ, Judas betrayed him with a kiss. Judas was not a bad man, but could not withstand the temptation; and yet those three years were not wasted while walking with the Master. "I am glad that so many have been able to be here so early, and I hope that you .may all return home filled with strength and courage to help carry on your work with sympathy and love for all mankind." Mrs. C. B. Noyes of Waterloo, a past president of the association, spoke on the "Home Beautiful," which was the general theme of the program and was suggested by Mrs. Noyes. She spoke as follows: "There is no word in our language so hard to define as HOME. Many definitions have been offered,- all colored by the individual point of view. Thus the humorist says, 'Home is the place where the modern youth pauses to change his clothes to . go somewhere else.' The little child says, 'Home is where Mother is.' The tired husband and father, thinking with longing for the comforts of his fireside, calls it a place of peace and rest. The mother may offer her definition in negative terms, recalling with glee the story of the mother who, on taking her children for an afternoon stroll, was accosted by a stranger with the words, 'Excuse me, Madam, but are these all yours, or is this a pic - nic?' And quick as a flash came the spirited answer, 'Sir, they are all mine, and it's no picnic!' Perhaps the best definition ever offered is the old one: 'Home is the sculptor's workshop wherein is %arved the destiny of men.' "But, whatever difficulty we may have in defining the word, none of us fail to recognize a home of beauty when we see it. We know, too, that home has two natures, the physical and the spiritual and both must be developed to make the home beautiful. The spiritual nature is an intimate thing, unseen by the casual observer excepting as it may show itself in the outward appearance. The stranger sees only the tidy lawn, the well kept buildings, the sweep of the fields beyond, and from them he forms his convictions as to the innate beauty of the home. And because of this it behooves us to present a gracious appearance to the world. But the true home-maker has a deeper and dearer reason for guarding the physical beauty of her home. As a mother broods over her beloved child, making its body clean and sweet, carefully guarding its food and sleep that it may grow ruddy cheeked and strong limbed, and delighting to dress it becomingly and with care, so .the true home-maker guards and cares for her home, not to meet the approval of the passing stranger, but because of the love she bears it. &lt;I2) </seg>

            <seg id="p382">I REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 1 . ' ' . . i . "The physical beauty of a home is not dependent upon wealth. Choice of color has more to do with the beauty of a room than has richness of rugs and hangings. One of the most attractive flower gar - dens I know is planted entirely with native roots requiring: only the transplanting. But as all beauty implies cleanliness, we fence our lawns against fowl and beast, keep back to its place the litter of the barn - yard, and sow seed in profusion until the green and bloom of our door - yard matches the rich sweep of the fields beyond. And so -we take the first step toward making the farm home what it should be by right — the most beautiful in the world. "An instinctive love of nature is implanted in every human breast. No one lives in the congested districts of a city from choice. The tenements are built for the man of small income. As soon as his earnings will permit, he finds a home farther from the city's center where he may have a tiny lawn of his own and plant a few feet of grass and flowers. As his income increases he moves again to find a larger space until at the outskirts of the city we find the estates of the wealthy men, whose well kept grounds are carefully planted to imitate nature at her best. "The elements of this beauty which is so prized, nature spreads with a prodigal hand about every country home. Above it she arches the blue of her sky dotted with clouds of fleecy white. . About it she spreads her fields of grain or of grassy meadow, green or gold in the summer and brown in winter, but never without lines of beauty; in the dooryard she flings her rich blooms wherever we wish, and if we will but keep our wood piled and our outbuildings where they will not mar her plans, she sees that every window frames a picture such as no artist can paint. So beautiful are her gifts that if we will but supple - ment them by our own efforts the exterior of our farm homes will always present an appearance of beauty. "And yet when all this is done and the physical beauty of home perfected, we realize that we have not built the true home beautiful. There is many an orphan asylum carefully tended and beautified that can only by courtesy be called a home; and there are doubtless many present today who recall with tenderness the rude settler's cabin or sod house of their youth, and realize that despite the lack of physical beauty which their hard working parents had little time to create, there was in that rude dwelling something indefinable which made it beautiful and which swells the heart whenever the vision of that little home arises. This is what we mean when we speak of the spiritual side of the home beautiful — it is something intangible yet very real; an invisible atmosphere which all must breathe. Child life develops or is dwarfed by it according to its purity and sunshine. It is as much </seg>
            <seg id="p383">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION within our power to create as is the physical beauty of the home, but by no means so easily. It is formed by the personalities of the in - mates of the home, and changed only as they develop or control their natures. For our lives are what we make them, and depend upon our characters and not the place in which we live. If we wish to develop the best there is in us, we will do it, whether we live on a farm or behind a brick wall. There is no such thing as narrowness unless we deliberately create it. The radio, the auto and the telephone have eliminated farm isolation, while, if we but will it, the best literature of the world may be brought daily to our doors. »■ "If our dinner table conversation deals with the faults of our neighbors; if we listen to jazz when a turn - of the dial will bring to us the best music of the world; if the latest modern novel with its lightly veiled indecency lies upon our table while the immortal classics are ignored, it is a matter of our own choice. "But we need not be surprised if our children's taste in music and books is low, and their morals tainted. It is not what we deliberately teach that forms the character of our children, as much as what they absorb by daily association. We have it in our power to raise or lower their standards in all things by our daily living. "I have spoken of the American farm home as' being by inherent right the most beautiful of the world, but this question of spiritual atmosphere, being one of character rather than of place, is not a problem of the country home alone. "There is one phase of the matter, however, in which the farm has distinctly the advantage — and that is the fact that by its very nature farm life binds the family together as no other life can. The father knows his children intimately because he is with them at all times, not merely at the hurried breakfast and the weary hoars after the work of. the day. The children, too, learn to love their home because they help to create it; little tasks, suited to their growing strength teach them habits of industry and the value of team work. There is no more beautiful thing in the. world than a home where all in harmony - work together for a common cause, with a mutual interest binding all 'in close bonds. "But when all has been said, I wonder sometimes if we all appreci - ate our country homes as we should. This question was impressed upon my mind when, a short time ago I visited a friend in a city apartment and marked the pride with which she showed me her rooms. There was a tiny living room with its furniture carefully placed to allow room for the family; a kitchen which was only a narrow passage be- </seg>
            <seg id="p384">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE SOARD OK AGRICULTURE tween stove and sink with no room for her toddling child; a dining room with built-in benches at the ends of a stationary table and above it, concealed in an innocent looking cupboard, a bed which was to be let down at night over the table, 'thus giving us another room', my hostess explained. Her woman's touch had made of those rooms a home but when I reached the street after my call, I instinctively drew a long breath as if stifled. I thought of the' country homes I had known, the light airy bedrooms with the blossom scented breezes blow - ing gently thru the windows; the cheery living rooms about which the family life centered; the cool kitchens where there was always room for the children to play while the mother performed her morning tasks. And suddenly I knew that unity of life is a safeguard, and that family ties are strongest where there is room for companionship. "But that which most interested me was the pride which my friend displayed. Never once did she admit that she was at all crowded, or that the rent would be sufficient to support a small family. She was displaying her home, the dearest spot on earth to her woman's heart, and her pride was justifiable. She never considered that that very pride had an economic value; yet the real estate agent could well afford to foster that feeling in all his tenants, for it did more toward keep - ing up values than did all his advertising. "Is there any reason that the same logic should not be applied to the farm? We hear. a great deal of pessimistic discussion of farm life today — is it possible that emphasizing the brighter side would help the situation? There is a great deal in mental attitude; if you want people to admire what you have, appreciate it yourself. We hear much today about salesmanship — schools teach it and young men are being trained in the art which consists chiefly in the ability to show to others one's own mental viewpoint, and so get the desired results. The foundation principle is to believe a thing thoroughly yourself, then by your very enthusiasm teach others to appreciate it. "In certain quarters there has always been a peculiar prejudice against farm life. This is often displayed in unpleasing ways. I have lived on a farm over thirty years without seeing a farmer habitually chewing a straw or sprinkling his conversation with crude and unde - sirable expletives — yet Uncle Josh still appears on the stage and car - toon pages without a single protest from those most interested. It is doubtful if any other honorable profession could be so maligned. Yet our play writers and cartoonists are kindly souls who seek only to please their public and not to lacerate feelings. The trouble is that we have never displayed sufficient pride to resent the ancient joke. </seg>
            <seg id="p385">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION "If the farm women took the same pride in their homes as did the apartment dweller; if they never allowed a slighting remark about country life to pass unchallenged; if they at all times sought to see and to show to others the. beauty and' freedom of fa. ' : fe, striving to develop its possibilities and to hide its defects — the effect upon both social and economic farm questions of today would be far reaching. It is even possible that as a result of this concerted action, the poli - ticians might be forced to find another question for their political foot - ball. "In view of all these things, let us on this New Year, resolve to love and cherish our homes as never before, to develop them both physically and spiritually and to show others our appreciation, until all recognize what we already know, that the farm home may be made above all others, the true home beautiful." Following this Mrs. Gaines led the group in singing a number of songs. Mrs. H. J. Bailey was unable to appear on the program and her place was filled by Miss Gladys Shamp, a lawyer of Omaha, who spoke on "Property Rights of Women." She told of some common law restrictions and changes and made some comparisons of the law in Nebraska with that of other states. In Nebraska, money which a woman earns outside of her home is her own. The wife today may enter into business. Any money or property that the wife has be - fore marriage remains her own. "The husband is responsible for the family necessities. The wife's money is her separate estate or property she had at the time of mar - riage, and the property wife and husband have together is joint prop - erty. It is in his name. Wife has no right to joint property. Wife's property is only charged with the- necessities of the family after hus - band's share has failed to pay the judgment. "The mother and father are equal guardians of the child. The father was formerly sole guardian. Neither parent can will the custody of the child to any one. The surviving spouse is the guardian of the child. As long as there is a surviving spouse the parent is the guar - dian. If the parent is shown to be incompetent or lacks moral stand - ing, if a relative can show this, the. judge will appoint some one the guardian or administrator of the estate. If you cannot show any in - competency the surviving parent is the guardian. "Wife can make any contract that she wants to, she can sue and be sued. She can even sue her husband. It is very different from what it used to be at common law. She may not only contract about her business but may convey it in her own name. The mother may have </seg>
            <seg id="p386">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE . separate property and the husband may have separate property in Nebraska. She may bring damage action. - She may bring suit and what money she gets is hers. She may make any sort of a business deal, such as notes, mortgages, etc. "In the state of Delaware the husband has all interest in wife's property. They have what is known as the dower and courtesy right. This has been abolished in Nebraska. The surviving spouse has the right to one-fourth of the estate in case that parent is not the parent of the child and there is a child or the issue of a child; one-third to go to surviving spouse if there is more than one child or the issue of any child and one-half to go to survivor in case the survivor is the parent and there is more than one child. That law is very fair. It gives the husband and wife the same rights. "Joint property, which always seems unfair to me, is ■ now in the name of the husband and the wife may have struggled hard, the hus - band would be allowed to will that property and the , wife might not be able to share in it. There is one advantage, however, a wife may take a will under the law. If the husband did not feel very kindly toward his wife on the day he made out his will, it might be very much to her advantage to take it under the law and receive her just share. "A will remains a will unless it is destroyed, cancelled or burned in the presence of the person who made it and by his wish. "In the Blanket Amendment of the National Women's Party, it speaks of equal rights. It is much better to think of it as equality. We will get much farther along on the quality basis than if we say equal rights, for what might be equal for one would not be equal for another. The industrial women need protective legislation. "We should work hard to get jury service for women in Nebraska. The decision of a case may be given a broader view if father and mother are both represented. We should consider it as a privilege and not just a duty to be allowed jury service. We do not mean that men are incapable but just like the property rights, it is one sided. It would seem more just and equal if women serve on the jury. "Parents inherit equally from a deceased child. That is a very fair thing. "An eastern woman upon securing a divorce pays her husband alimony. This is a very rare case, however. "The husband is still considered the head of the house according to law." </seg>
            <seg id="p387">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION At eleven o'clock the group divided into smaller units to attend round table discussions held in the Home Economics Building. Reports of the round tables are as follows: . PROBLEMS OF THE PRE-SCHOOL CHILD Miss Saunders In discussing the problems of the " pre-school child, emphasis was placed upon the normal problems of childhood rather than the abnormal. The modern parents are not falling down on the job of training their children but they are more alert to problems that arise and are more willing .to discuss these problems with other people. One of the biggest problems of today is the fact that families are small and there are too many grown-ups for the number of children. iThis. results in over-stimulation and the only- remedy is to place the child with other children for at least a part of the day. The nursery school supplements the home life of the child by providing this oppor - tunity to associate with other children. A child delights to make things in his play. Plain paper, pencils, blocks, and other building materials may easily be provided for this construction work. The mother should not overlook the value of books, pictures, and good music in training her child. Several problems of pre-school children were discussed: 1. Independence. Every child is an individual and should learn to make his own decisions. 2. Curiosity. This is a means, of learning new things and when children ask questions they should be carefully and truthfully answered. 3. Imagination. Children delight in fairy tales because they give an opportunity to use the imaginative power that every child possesses. The real truth about fairy tales should be taught so that he will dis - tinguish truth from untruth. 4. Fear. All fears except those of loud noises and of falling are taught to children and care should be taken to not make a child afraid of many things that are not really harmful. He should be taught to fear some things that may harm him but this should really be caution rather than fear. The attendance on Tuesday was forty-five and on Wednesday, thirty-eight. The round table discussion on "Looking Forward in Extension," led by Miss Brown, was conducted using a true-false-doubtful test as a basis for the discussion. The following statements were used and each person checked the statement as true, doubtful or false. The at - tendance was thirty-five on Tuesday and forty on Wednesday: </seg>

A project in which a study would be made of curtains, bedding, table linen, towels, pillows, etc., would appeal to the women . 2. Tours or pageants if used for Achievement Day would appeal to the people as much as our present Achievement Day programs 3. There are women in a county who would ap - preciate having a specialist come to the county for about 4 meetings, at which would be held round table discussions on child development with topics on training the appetite and other physical care such as sleep and exercise. Behavior problems dealing with jealousy and' tantrums could be discussed beside topics on punishment, developing honesty, telling the truth, guiding the imagination, play indoors and out, and proper toys and equipment 4. It would be well to close the enrollment for new clubs at the time of the project planning day .... 5. A project called "Sewing for the House" or "Dressing the House" or "Dressing the Home •Attractively" could be made of value to home - makers 6. Some counties are handicapped in putting on a large program of work because it involves more activities than one agent is able to handle 7. Large training meetings are unsatisfactory, so it would be well to limit the number that could attend a leader's training meeting to 10 clubs .... 8. Because project leaders receive so much benefit from being leaders it would be well to start the plan of having leaders serve for two years. Thus one new leader would be selected each year , 9. Women would appreciate knowing from what, - and how various materials are made, also how to select those that will wear well 10. Women would like a short time project on civic problems 11. More real_ good would be accomplished at a county fair if no prizes were given but the money was equally distributed between the clubs exhibiting ; </seg>
            <seg id="p389">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION Miss Shamp's discussion was attended by a group of between fifty and sixty women. She continued a discussion of points brought up in her talk just preceding this meeting. The attendance was fifty. The program in the afternoon was again opened with music fur - nished through the courtesy of Mr. Willard Kimball, director of the Uni - versity School of Music. Mr. L. DeMoss, accompanied by Mrs. Macbeth, sang these songs: "Requiem" Homer "In a Hundred Thousand Years." "Sonny O' Mine." Miss E. E. Conner, Educational Director of the Kit Dye Corpora - tion, gave a demonstration on "Preparation for Dyeing." The 4-H Club team demonstration, "Clothing the Human Foot," was given by Helen Morgan and Fern Harris. Their leader, Miss Jennie Morgan, introduced the girls. Following the demonstration five minutes were given to commun - ity singing again led by Mrs. N. W. Gaines, after which Mr. Dwight Kirsch of the University School of Fine Arts gave a demonstration on "Beautifying with Pictures." Mr. Kirsch said: "Before I start out talking about the subject, I would like to have you understand two things about my talk. The first is, I am not try - ing to sell anything. The second, I was brought up on a farm in Ne - braska, so if anything I say sounds wrong, that may be the reason. "This talk is not entirely about pictures. I am going to try to tell you about the choice of pictures, about proper framing and hanging of a picture. All of-the pictures that I have here were loaned to us by a department store in Lincoln, and is the choice of the best pictures that were left after Christmas. They are pictures that may be bought at any time at reasonable prices. "I want to give the reasons why people choose pictures for their home. I am leaving out the family photographs and pictures that are given to you. "The first reason for choosing a picture is because of the subject of the picture. You may choose it because of some experience you have had. The scene in the woods (showed illustration) reminds you of autumn. If you would choose that picture it might bring back some experience you had. Some choose a picture because the subject is sentimental, as the moonlight night, etc. (12.) </seg>
            <seg id="p390">REPORT OK NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OK AGRICULTURE "The second, because of the picture being popular. Because you have seen it often. This is a very big risk sometimes, it is not neces - sarily good. It is like popular music. "The third, because the colors are pleasing. Fourth, because of the decorative value of furnishing a home. Fifth, because the picture represents the work of some artist as an Italian or Dutch painter. Sixth, because of the artistic merit of the picture. Good pictures help to give a feeling of life in a home. If you have a bare room it is lacking in pictures sometimes. If you have pictures that you like, they will be like friends in your home, they satisfy you and give a warm friendly feeling in the home. The reason why I enumerated them, I want to make a point. As you study, if you love pictures, you will be less governed by the first two reasons and more governed by the last two reasons. "I am going to mention some of the lasting qualities that should and should not be found in good pictures. The first place, I would like to compare your liking of a picture to a good friend. Like a good friend, a picture must be something more than a print, must have last - ing qualities. It has to be 'something more than just pretty. You will have to come to a picture again and again. The best way to find it out is to have it in the home for years. "Second, the first impression of the picture is not always true one, as a friend, you don't always get the right impression the first time. "There are two or three terms that they use. One is 'sweet', one 'charm' and 'cleverness*. If it is clever, that does not always mean that it is good. In other words a picture has to have something under the surface. "One of the first things that people ask, does the picture tell a story. Second, the subject matter of the picture. That may be rather a bold thing to say. It seems to me that an artist can make a picture of a garbage can and a tomato can. The subject matter does not make a bit of difference. It is whether the artist is interested in the subject to bring out something worth while. Third, the fact that the picture is realistic. "I will give some qualities that must be placed in the great picture. First, it must have vitality, something that makes the picture seem alive. Some pictures give you the feeling that it has just left the artist's hands. This vitality is often lost in the copies. Many of the reproductions of sculptoring have lost their vitality. They are said to have much more life in the original. It is the same way about pic - tures. The original or a very good copy may have more life than a </seg>
            <seg id="p391">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION poor copy or cheap copy of a picture. This vitality will depend on the person looking at the picture. A young person would not necessarily appreciate some pictures that an older person would. Second, every picture should have a center of interest. There has to be a central theme. Third, good composition applied to pictures, like composition in literature. Fourth, character, like a. person, there has to be some - thing below the surface., something that is lasting. "There are other ways of acquiring pictures besides going to stores. You can cut good pictures out of magazines, mount them and have them framed. Have them dry mounted in a photograph house, they will stay flat and not curl. (Showed several illustrations from Literary Digest, Woman's Home Companion, New York Times and ad - vertisements.) "When you travel and go to museums, you can often get copies of pictures very reasonable that are very good. Get all the pictures you can when you are abroad; copies of drawings, good pictures of sculptoring. I think we need more than anything, the buying of pic - tures direct from artists. Some people are afraid to buy them direct. You will probably make mistakes at first. These originals have a lot more life to them. Some pictures suitable are etchings and block prints and water pictures that may be had from $5.00 to $15.00. There are many artists working right in this city who will sell their works. "In this town there is an organization of working artists. They have been here for eight years; they are called the Lincoln Artist Guild. They hold an exhibition every year for the people of Lincoln, simply for the purpose of interesting the people of the city. I wish you all would look into this matter. By buying more of these pictures, you will learn about pictures. You will learn the good forms and the bad. "The use of pictures is to make up a part of a well decorated home. We used too many pictures in the home a few years ago, and deco - rators were against the use of them so much, but I believe pictures will always be used in the home. "The picture should be similar to the wall in tone. You can use a picture as the center interest of the room .or you can use it above a piece of furniture in the room. You can sometimes have more color in the last occasion. "The picture frame is the finish of a picture, like a window frame. A good picture will look very bad if it does not have a good frame. If you have a proper frame it adds a professional finish to it If you care for the picture, no frame should be used that would help to take </seg>
            <seg id="p392">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 1 the interest from the picture. If you have a strong picture, as a poster, you will have to use a strong looking picture frame. The color of the picture frame should harmonize with the picture. You can use a complementary color. Sometimes a striking picture frame will add to a black and white picture. Natural wood frame could be used more. They are cheap. There is not much money in making them. Natural wood has a light tone and is good for etchings. "Mats in pictures are not used so much in. pictures as long ago. The tone of the matting is necessary. The matting should not attract too much attention. "I want to talk about the matter of hanging of pictures. The eye level should be kept in the hanging of pictures. Try and make the nail as invisible as you can. If the wire comes up to a point, it leads the eye to a point away from the picture. The wire should be parallel. It helps to color the wire the same color as the background and also lacquer the hooks." Following Mr. Kirsch's demonstration, Mrs. S. P. Davis announced the appointment of committees: Courtesy Committee — ■' Mrs. D. M. Hildebrand, Seward. Miss Mary Partington, Lincoln. Mrs. W. J. Barnes, Cotesfield. Nominating Committee — Mrs. W. W. Burr, Lincoln. Mrs. Henry Tool, Murdock. Mrs. C. E. Stahl, Walton. At 4 o'clock, Mrs. W. W. Burr, president of Ceres Club, invited the group to attend the tea at Morrill Hall. A committee from the club took charge and provided transportation for the group to Morrill Hall. A large number of women attended the tea and took advantage of the opportunity to view the building and to visit exhibits in the building. A distinguished guest was the son of Count Tolstoi who spoke briefly on peasant life in Russia. He told how the Russian peasant lives stress - ing especially the condition of the peasant woman. On Wednesday morning the meeting opened at 9:00 with Mrs. S. P. Davis, president, presiding in the absence of Mrs. Max Adams, vice - president. </seg>
            <seg id="p393">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION Music was again furnished by the University School of Music. The following numbers were sung by Jack Wheelock with Miss Ruth Miller accompanying him: "Kashmiri Song" ; Finden "Homing" Del Riego "To a Hill Top" Cox "I Hear You Calling Me". Marshall Following this Miss Nellie Williams of the Public Library Com - mission spoke on "Children's Reading." She likened good and poor reading books to the foundations of houses. The poor reading is like a house built upon the sand which is not durable and soon falls into ruin while good books are likened to a house built upon the rocks which will stand always and makes for the substantial things in life. She urged the mothers always to discriminate between good and poor books which all children under sixteen should read. This list is com - piled by the U. S. Bureau of Education. The Public Library Commis - sion, of which Miss Williams is a member, sends out good children's book lists. There is no excuse for people not knowing what is good reading and what is not, with all the helps available. Miss Williams told of an exhibit which she once made. She built two houses, one on a foundation of sand held together with lath, using the poor books for the house. These books were gotten together thru a request sent to the public libraries of the state and were sent in by the dozens. The other house was built on a stone foundation and was composed of books which are the possessions of the Public Library Commission. Thus the difference between good and bad books was demonstrated. Miss Williams then told a pretty fable about books which was' much enjoyed. • At 9:45, the University of Nebraska meat judging team which won national honors at the International Live Stock Show in Chicago gave their demonstration, "What is a Steak?" They were introduced by Miss Rebekah Gibbons who, with Mr. Loeffel of the Animal Hus - bandry Department, coached the team. Following this demonstration the president called upon Miss Fedde to introduce the next speaker, Miss Isabel Bevier, of the University of Illinois. Miss Bevier gave the first of a series of talks on the "Farm Home." She said: "Lincoln and Nebraska are new acquaintances with me. I am glad to talk about the farm home. I was brought up in one, I have been really interested in it, I have been in Illinois for the past twenty - live years. </seg>
            <seg id="p394">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE "I want to stop on the first word, 'Farm' of 'Farm Home and Purposes.' I have a feeling that there are very many of the difficul - ties in the home on the farm and in town that are alike. I have known people who have married at Christmas time to go on the farm to get ready for spring. It takes a year to find out what things are on the farm. Work is there. If these people are going to get married at the holiday season, I would like to have them start in October. I think there are people on the farm who have lived there ten years who have not decided what they are there for. "We are controlled more or less by our pocketbooks. With the money that we do have, must we have an expensive automobile ? Should we have all this money in the car? Or, shall we have a Ford and a bathroom? Are we going to have a $192.00 radio? You should begin in October to know what you are going to buy. "There are two- things we avoid. Pocketbooks because the women did not have any, and if she did, she did not have anythnig in it. Women did not used to know what the income was. The two things that impress me are, now every woman has her pocketbook and some - thing in it. "There is becoming a better understanding that the farm home business is a partnership business. There may be one pocketbook but it can be used for more than one person. "It did not used to be ladylike to have publicity. It is a totally different question now. I would like to have you understand the pur - poses of the farm home. It is not just a place to rest and sleep in. They say the town homes are just a place to dress in to go somewhere. With the car now, you can go anywhere. I know those people who do up the chores with great speed on Saturday nights so that they can go to town Saturday night and have fun.' We feel that rural life must make recreation for their people, both young and old. We used to laugh at the word recreation. The World War taught us that we had not paid enough attention to our health. The rural people were found to have just as bad health as the town folks for all the free air we have. Health is very fundamental on the farm home. The individual bill is about $35.00 per person each year for ill health. What are you going to do in this home ? Are you going to work like a horse ? Is your home the center for the community where plans are made? We must remember that we are making provisions for this. "The banker selects the seed for the farm, now it is time that he select the family, especially the wife. If you live in Arizona for six months, you will do well. The rural population in Arizona turns over </seg>
            <seg id="p395">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION completely in three years. If you want to move out of the home, that depends on what you have put in it. ■"An essential thing is the farm home. Is it attractive, accessible? Is it convenient to other buildings, td the highway, to neighbors and the church? If you would answer these questions, I would know con - siderable about you. (Story of fence around house.) Is your home attractive? I remember three neighbors where I used to live. One had the barn across the road from the house; they had to track the mud from the road into the house. The neighbor to the west, had the barn in front of the house. The third, you drove into a lot, not a big lot, and the barn was back of the house a little way. Sometimes the house is too convenient to the barn, to the smells and the squeal of the hogs. "Value of the house relative to the other farm buildings. Are the people putting more into the barns than they are into the house? In Illinois it is about fifty-fifty. The pocketbook tells whether you are to spend money or not. Some barns are much nicer than some houses. "Living and working facilities. Provision for heat, light and water. We must be warm. You must have water enough to keep clean and light enough to see how dirty you are. I feel that cleanli - ness is next to Godliness. Some women say that they would rather have light than anything else. The questions of heat, light and water are the beginning for living conditions. It depends on what you want. Get these things one at a time. You will never get a bathroom unless you remind yourself of it. Most women have little trouble in getting a furnace. Men would rather build one fire than five. Heat comes first. It is hard to live in two rooms. Sewage is another thing to be considered. If you are going to have safe water, you must have proper sewage. "Does it cost too much more to haye flowers? A fence around the farm home means that you are distinguishing yourself from the lower animals. Flies are other things that must be guarded against, not just have screens, but not let them breed near the house. "Plan for the farm home. Farm homes should be different .from the town home. In town they need a reception hall. The company coming to a farm want to stay a while and do not want to stay in a reception hall. It used to be the custom to put the receipts on the clock shelf or in the clock. You should have an office to do your business in. A farm has a great deal of business to do. I would like to have at least a table with a drawer in it, a pencil that has seen something to sharpen it on besides the baby's teeth. The house needs the simplest rooms, a place to live in, sleep in and work in. We want them con- </seg>
            <seg id="p396">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE venient, we want them so that we can rest. A successful farm house plan is successful when it is planned so that the work of that particular family can be done. A bed room down stairs is convenient; you can use it for the children in the day time and for a library, too. Another thing that a farm home needs is a big dining room and a good sized kitchen. It saves a good many steps if you can eat. in the kitchen in the winter. It did not used to be right to eat in the kitchen, but since we have the breakfast nooks, it is all right. "We must have storage space. I found out a while back that a good place to store things was under the bed. I never knew so much stuff could be put under a bed until I saw one one time. Put the room where you are going to have the things to . store. "Men are no fonder of dirt than we are. Have the outside door lead into the basement. The room will be warm in the winter and cool in the summer. Have a shelf about a foot high for the boots and shoes. Another shelf for gloves and mittens and plenty of hooks. "I want warm and cold water. If you have a furnace, you • can have a pipe io the furnace and have hot water. Some people have the front door too far from the kitchen. It is- so far that they never walk that far. Some people you would rather have, come to the front door than come to the back door. "When we are warm and clean, we can have leisure. Equipment does not mean a vacuum cleaner. Have a good butcher knife. Some women keep their recipes in an old blue pitcher on the top shelf in the pantry and every time they want a recipe, they have to hunt. all through them to And what they want; A simple device would be a shoe box. The children could write them on cards. A washing machine is next. Our farm life brings us a good deal of dirt and things- that are soiled. Some women have a cold from November to March, because they get all het up from washing and go out in the cold to hang the clothes out. I would make this provision for being clean. "Some women have to have very good control of themselves to keep from buying aluminum from the people that have been canvassing the country. Don't buy anything that you dp not need. ; Don't start a museum too early. Don't go to the dime store and buy this and that because you think you may need it. Secure equipment that is adaptive to the mode of living and for the kind of work that you do. "Some people are right when they say woman's work is never done. Sometimes we have to work all day, but if that is kept up day after day, then your life is warped; you need to shut the kitchen door </seg>
            <seg id="p397">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION and' walk out. You are kitchen minded. Try and make a schedule and follow it. "Women said that in the time of the World War it was their duty to preserve food. Some people can everything that they can and some that could not be canned. It is best to live out of our own can than the tin can. I wonder if it would not be better to live out of tin cans than to completely wear ourselves out in the summer canning this food." At 10:45, the group again divided to attend the round table dis - cussions. This year three of the round table discussions -were repeated on Wednesday morning because many women expressed a desire to attend more than one and this arrangement gave them that oppor - tunity. Miss Nellie Williams arranged an exhibit of children's books and answered questions regarding them. About 30 women visited this exhibit. Miss Bess Steele conducted a round table on Beauty Spots in the Home. One hundred women were present. A report of this meeting ■ follows: "As we entered the room we found several different beautiful ar - rangements. One was a possible arrangement for a buffet, another for an end table, still others for small tables against the wall and for hall tables or bed side tables. Miss Steele said she took this topic because her adult class in Lincoln told her that they felt it would help them the most to know how to make interesting arrangements. It is not possible for all of us to change our furniture, drapes, etc., but by a few simple attractive arrangements on the table, bookcase and other places we may make our homes more pleasing. "Our ideas have changed in the last fifteen years. We are more restless, perhaps it is because we have too many things around us, on the piano, tables, and bookcase. A free space is restful, then keep those objects that have art value. "In making a grouping have a center of interest, then give it a ; setting. A precious box, a vase of Chinese lanterns, a small paper decorated box were grouped together. These objects need to have something in common, as for example, color. In this case different intensities of the colors were repeated. This group was held or tied together by a dark purple hanging used as a background. Purple was a color opposite the other colors used. In family life it is more inter - esting to have some opposition, likewise it makes these groups more </seg>
            <seg id="p398">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE interesting to have an opposing color, but it must not overpower, it should be dark in value and dull in intensity. "There are other objects that have decorative possibilities such as books, their bindings and shape add a great deal of charm to an arrangement. Candlesticks, bowls, vases, and flowers are other objects of decorative value. "Vases were next discussed by Miss Steele. She said that in her adult class that out of the vases they brought only one was suitable to use as a flower container. Many of them were too decorated. Any decoration that does not follow the structure does not belong. Of course, to begin with, the object must be pleasing in shape and proportion. "Color also is important. Some colors are the pure color; these are crude. Others are soft and refined; they contain some of the neigh - boring colors and assume other refined qualities. We may compare color to music. .Pure color, used boldly, is like crude, jazz music; mixed color or those containing neighboring colors and are dulled a trifle are refined, have qualities such as the symphony in music. "The subject of the use of flowers as decoration was discussed. Real flowers add greatly to the charm and decoration of a room, but we must study their use (do not crowd in a vase), and place them to bring out their beauty. "Should we use artificial flowers, was a question asked of Miss Steele. She asked for different opinions from the group. Some felt we should not, that they were untrue and insincere. Others felt that the crepe paper flowers crude, but that some of the flowers on the market were all right to use. Some felt that if they didn't have any - thing else, the artificial ones could be used. It was decided that artificial flowers were not beautiful, did not have decorative value, but rather we should use the real flowers and in winter use bittersweet, Chinese lanterns and select beautiful grasses and weeds that are beautiful in form and line rather than in color." Mrs. H. H. Wheeler took charge of the round table on Property Rights of Women. The points discussed were similar to those brought up in the Tuesday meeting. The attendance was thirty-seven. The Wednesday afternoon program was opened with the following musical numbers: To a Wild Rose — MacDowell. From the Canebrake — Gardner. Miss Macel O'Brien, violinist, was accompanied by Mr. Art Schrepel at the piano. </seg>
            <seg id="p399">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION '• Mrs. Davis then introduced Miss Rebekah Gibbons, who is head of the food department. Miss Gibbons spoke on Fads and Fake Advertise - ments, Are We Duped by Them? She said: "The public just loves to be fooled and we are the public. Don't we remember when we first learned that there was no Santa Claus and how peeved we were at the person who told us ? Most folks remember having had a crying spell about it. "If we have curves where they don't belong we feel so enthusiastic over the wonderful advertisements of the merits of Wallace's Reducing Bread at sixty cents a loaf; We would love to think that a good whole - some slice would make the curves suddenly and mysteriously disappear and we are perfectly willing to pay the price. It looks like graham bread and contains nearly the same amount of calories and we know graham bread does not reduce. Common sense tells us that we never get thin eating anything, but by not eating. "We see a beautiful picture of a sylph-like lady with an ugly fat shadow in the background and we so want to look like her. Well, the advertisement tells us that Howell's beautiful building cream will bring about that result. We immediately buy a jar for 52.50 which consists of fifteen cents worth of cocoa butter and twenty-five cents worth of jar. "Manufacturing 'concerns are not so dumb. They know the public likes to believe all it reads in advertisements. Who are the public? You and me and the neighbors. The public is interested in health and the manufacturers know it or they would not talk about it and dwell on the subject. When material on health facts is sent out the replies come in by the hundreds to the manufacturers. They know their .product is a good one and what if they do tell a few white lies about it, if the public will fall for them? Advertisers could not spend as much as you and I earn in a year for a single ad if it did not bring results. Many advertise really good products, but make too extravagant claims for them. The. public is used to extravagant claims and so they are afraid not to use them. Advertisements can be likened to the barkers at a county fair. The one who can make the greatest claims gets the most business. "Take the matter of waterless cookers. A waterless cooker is noth - ing more or less than a real good stew pan, but the manufacturer would have you believe all sorts of ridiculous things about it. We can cook without water very satisfactorily in this pan, but there are some things which we can not cook satisfactorily when covered. Did you ever try cooking cabbage without any water covered in a pan? It is very un - palatable and smells like mustard gas used in the war, when covered. </seg>
            <seg id="p400">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE We can cook some things which we can allow to boil down either with - out water or a very little water. We do not want to pour away the - minerals and vitamins, of course, and we have taught this for years. Have you ever tried to drink coffee from an aluminum cup at a picnic? If you have you know that every bit of heat spreads all over the cup and makes it very hot and this is just what happens in cooking in aluminum and the food being cooked does not burn in spots. The waterless cookers have an insulated asbestos bottom. Claims are made by the advertisers that the food in them must be cooked below the boiling point of water and can be done. During such demonstrations food has been burned. Did you ever burn anything below the boiling point of water? Some people claim that vitamins are lost in steam when food is cooked in an open kettle. It must be hard for the minerals and vitamins to crawl out in the steam. I can't imagine it, can you? They tell us we can afford to buy them because we save so much money in the shrinkage of meat. The shrinkage of .meat is caused by the water cooking out of it and we do not save money from saving water. It is very cheap. They practically do not mention- the very fine points of such a piece of equipment. Every one should have a well made sauce pan that will allow her to cook with a very little water or without water. "Consider the ads of breakfast foods* They have everything in them in the world. They would lead us to believe that we should eat breakfast foods - and nothing else. How many of us would care for breakfast foods for a steady diet? Everybody likes to cry the loudest about the favorite breakfast food. And these extravagant claims are made about a perfectly good product and we are sorry that they do that sort of thing. We should all write them a letter telling them we like their product, but are disgusted with their advertising. "Now let us consider ovaltine. It is a harmless but useless product which they tell us in very impressive tones comes from Switzerland. The ads start out with some such statement as 'I did not think I should save my child's life, but Ovaltine did it.' What is it? It is simply chocolate malted milk with a little dried egg in it. We can not pay such prices for this simple product. But the advertiser tells us in flowery words that it is concentrated nutritive material from malted milk with egg and a little cocoa added. Upon analyzing it, we find that it contains fifty calories to a cup, while there are 170 calories in a glass of milk. Why does it put us to sleep ? Will you sleep after drink - ing a cup of hot cocoa or a cup of hot milk? Of course you will. It gets the stomach busy and uses the blood where it will not keep us awake. "How about tea? They tell us there is a vitamin in tea. We hardly know where to classify it. It is all right for grown-ups, but </seg>
            <seg id="p401">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION certainly not for youngsters. There are six vitamins to date. Green tea contains one and not very much of that. It is vitamin C, which is easily destroyed by drying or cooking. How much tea do you put in the hot water and how long do you let it stand for vitamin C to soak out? There is a very little of vitamin C left in the tea. "How about yeast? Eat a cake of yeast It is harmless. If you eat enough of it it will cure constipation. We give rats half yeast and half food. How many of us would like to go on a diet of half yeast and half food to secure results. You can if you wish, but none of it in mine. I am not that much devoted to it. Yeast is highly recommended by foreign peoples, so the ads say. No one here is willing to put his name down as advocating these remarkable results and have his friends laugh at him. But eat yeast if you want to make yourself a home brew place. • ■ ■ "Now, we will talk about something that is really harmful. That is Borden's Eagle Brand Milk. It is good for adults. When it is analyzed for infant feeding, no mother that wasn't feeble minded would be willing to give it to her baby. It is composed of five parts of water and one part of milk, and more than half as much sugar as milk. The baby gets fat with all that sugar. Could it help it? But it is not the solid fat that we would like to see a baby have. The body stores much water and a part of the fat is water and not a healthy fat. It results in poor teeth* poor bones and a fretful baby. Doctors usually prescribe it for sick babies, for if he should tell a mother to mix a milk herself containing five parts of water and one part of milk, the mother would think she was starving her baby, so the doctor capitalizes on Borden's, but most people do not know this. He will not keep the baby on it long, but only to help in building it up. Some people wean their babies and put them on Borden's. This is a tragedy. This is a type of advertising which leads- to harmful results. Food concerns spend thousands a year for advertising just to keep the name before our eyes. Why should they not give information that is of value to us? For instance, I saw an advertisement last night of the most beautiful crystal dish full of canned peaches. It told that it was one of the choice 149 products which Libby has and nothing else. They gave no real information about the product and that is what would have been of interest They make four or five brands of the same peach, but label the fancy brand Libby and the others Happy Vale, Hillsdale and Brookdale, using a different grade of syrup and some without sugar, but all may be canned from the same tree. The brands which are not the fancy kind are good enough for ordinary use, but most of us can not discriminate, because we do not know the inside truth. We get peeved at their advertising, because they do not telL us the things that we want to know. We should get together and do something about advertisements and let </seg>
            <seg id="p402">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OK AGRICULTURE ? the manufacturers know that we are not duped by them and they will change their manner of advertising." Mrs. W. LeRoy Davis followed Miss Gibbons and discussed Bills That Will Probably Be Before the 1929 Legislature: "I hope that after this Legislature is over and if any of you re - member my speech you will recall that the session is only a few days eld and since I am not the seventh daughter of the seventh son or the seventh daughter of the seventh daughter, I will do the best I can to bring before you somewhat the picture of what will be before the 1929 session of the Legislature. Having given my alibi, I will proceed. "The Legislature is comprised of 133 members. Every two years we elect these 133 people to attend to the legislative affairs of our state. The legislature is held in odd years. One hundred members are members of the lower house. They are supposed to come from dis - tricts that are determined on the basis of population. It is so much easier to go by counties so now we say such and such a man represents such and such a county. Most of the' representatives represent from 9,000 to 22,000 people. There are thirty-three senators and their dis - tricts are large. They represent from 34,000 or more people. It costs the state $200,000 to conduct a legislature. Each legislator is allowed $800.00 for the session, one trip to Lincoln and one back at the rate of 1 cent per mile. Most people have an idea that they try to be in session as long as possible. But as most of the members are farmers, it is hard to keep them in session after the spring work begins on the farm. They are usually ready to go home by the first of April. "One of the bills which will come up before the legislature is what to do about our bank guaranty law. This will be one of the most im - portant bills. In 1911 we passed the bank guaranty act. A crisis will happen in 1929 if no reaction is taken. A mutual life insurance com - pany will send an inspector out to see you before you are made a mem - ber. That is, the inspector is a medical man. That is what was left out of the bank guaranty law when it was passed. They set up the machinery, but they did not set up the machinery to see if banks who became members' were able to carry the results. One-tenth of 1 per cent was thought to be sufficient to cover the losses during that period. What happened in 1922 and 1921 we all know. The bank suffered along with the rest of us. The assessment was not enough to make up the ses. We have had about three crises in the situation of the bank aranty law. They have been met with heroic efforts on the part of ! bankers themselves, until at the present time we find ourselves facing the third and perhaps the most severe crisis. The deficit was about $25,000,000 and the ' next legislature will have to do something about it. Failure of the act was due to the fact that the state was not </seg>
            <seg id="p403">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION back of the banks. Of course, the law does not guarantee that. The state just sets up the machinery to take from the bankers the assess - ment and pay out the losses. . The state itself does not guarantee the payment. Many people have the idea that the state is behind it, but [this is not so. The bank guaranty act itself will probably meet with a great many amendments during the present legislature. It may be even discarded, as it has not filled the present need. Some people feel that it is a good thing and should be continued with amendments, but the fact remains something must be done about the banks. Sugges - tions that have been made are not to attempt to pay interest on any of these deposits, but attempt to pay the principal. It might be that amendments will be added which require more experienced inspectors for the banks and have the charters of the banks looked into more strictly. In the past the bank inspectors have been men who were seeking experience, but it is now thought if -we are to have the banks well inspected we must have men with more business experience than we have employed in the past. The bankers themselves have only pro - tested against any further assessments. They have brought an injunc - tion against the state to ask not to have any more. The bank guaranty act will be one of the most important subjects to come before the legislature. ■ : - •■■■■■■■.' "Another important issue is the presentation of the budget. The legislature must pass on every appropriation before the state can pay out any money. The appropriation for the last biennial was $28,000,000. One-half of the appropriation only comes from taxes. The other half is made up from the gasoline tax, license fees, the university and normal school fees and federal aid. Actual part out of the taxes is $14,000,000. Included in this is the appropriation to finish the capitol. Only four cents on every taxed dollar is for the capitol. I think there should be a bill to provide for better care taken of the capitol. It should provide for some one who would be familiar with the different materials that go into this beautiful building that is going up, that is, some one who is familiar with the upkeep of the grounds as well as the interior of the building. "The university will ask for an increase appropiation to build dormitories for the freshmen girls, if not for the whole freshman class. The Board of Regents have asked -for this appropriation time after time, but they have never received it. The budget for the university will be $6,600,000. Two million comes in from fees and $4,100,000 comes out of the tax fund. "People in the state feel that a junior college is probably an answer to the question about having more schools and keeping the students at home. For example, the junior college at McCook was established with </seg>
            <seg id="p404">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE this idea in view. . There probably will be a bill in the legislature to this effect. "Four million five hundred thousand dollars are appropriated for the maintenance of the delinquent institutions of the state. The feeble - minded institution at Beatrice in particular has a big need. The appro - priation is scarcely large enough to maintain the upkeep of the institu - tion and provide for new buildings, so the appropriation is always cut on the new buildings — the only place it can be cut, however, as food must be provided and salaries paid. "During this legislature we expect to have a controversy over the civil administrative code. The incoming governor will recommend com - bination of departments under the code. The code was established through the efforts of the people to centralize the activities of the state. The work had been so divided that one department did one thing and a committee did another. S. R. McKelvie brought about the cen - tralization of the state affairs and some thirty boards were centralized under six heads. These heads were called secretaries appointed by the governor. At this time there was an addition in the taxes which made it easy for some to say that the code was due for the increase and this fact has been made quite an issue in the politics of the state. How - ever, the day of small taxes is gone. "Another question before the legislature will be the game laws. This always comes up and much discussion is held as to whether it is lawful to shoot or trap on the 20th day of this month or the 20th day of the next. The question of the driving of motor vehicles will also come up. Another attempt will be' made to try to license drivers. Probably this is a way to get more careful drivers. "The revision of the court procedure will also come up. At the time the rules for the members of the jury were passed, men only had the right to vote, but now since women have the right of franchise, they will serve on juries and the rules of procedure will need to be changed. There will be a measure to, abolish the jury box. "The child labor measure will also come up. This bill was passed by Congress. This is an ancient bill and has an interesting history. "In this day of laws and statutes it is not an easy matter to be an American citizen- and not easy for a man to be a legislator." Mrs. Gaines then asked the group to stand and sing several familiar songs. At 2:45 Miss Bevier gave the next of her series of talks. She dis - cussed the Convenient Farm Home. </seg>
            <seg id="p405">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION "In the farm home a plan is very important, and after making a plan follow that plan. It is not always possible to follow that plan exactly every day, but follow it as best you can. In the early years when I was teaching- in the University of Illinois, I was constantly being: interrupted by office calls and telephone calls. And I did not like to be interrupted in my lectures, so one day I decided I would make a plan and follow it. I would not answer my office calls nor telephone calls. This morning: I had scarcely begun the class work when the telephone rang. As I had determined not to be interrupted, I pretended not to hear the telephone. The students looked at me and wondered if I had suddenly gone deaf. The telephone kept on ringing, so I con - cluded I could not go on with the work until this call had been answered. I answered it and found that one of the university authorities wanted help on the naming of one of the new buildings on the campus. But I quickly disposed of the question hy saying that I needed time to think about such a matter. The class work was resumed and then presently there came a knock at my office door. My first impulse was to pay no attention to it, as I had determined not to be interrupted in my class work. The knocking, however, continued and so I decided to find out who it might be. When I opened the door there stood the president of the university with a distinguished visitor from Canada. After that I decided we can not follow our plan exactly every day, but that does not hinder us from trying to follow it out as best we can. "The homemaker must ever be on the alert to discover ways and places for saving labor. It is a wrong kitchen that makes us walk many more miles than necessary while doing our work. The man who runs an engine has gauges and levers to control the movements of the engine as well as to know the pressure at all times. He has it all within sight and within easy reach of his hand. How different is the woman with her oven. Se must get down on her knees to see into the oven to know whether the cake is raising or not. Some improvement has come in this regard with the placing of glass in the oven door. Now the' woman knows what is going on inside of her oven without having to open the dor. "There is this difference between the women of today and the ones thirty years ago: the women of today have to use more intelligence. She has to make intelligent choice of her utensils. In the management of resources we must have strength, health, patience, courage and love. How much are you contributing? How much is your partner con - tributing?

One man's idea of recreation was to get up at 4 o'clock in the morning so he could rest the remainder of the day while the others worked hard. Do you have a schedule and arrange to do so much in a certain time or do you hang over the fence and visit with some one all the forenoon? Many people think if they had money they could do so many things. But I say if you used your brains more you would not need so much money. How is the auto used? Is it used entirely for business or do you leave on Saturday night and see how far and fast you can drive and yet be back on Monday morning? Do you let the children have the car and then when you want to go to the city for some necessary article you do not know where they are and you can not go on with your work until you get the repairs? People say they have become better acquainted with their family since the auto came into existence. The whole family goes places together. How is the Victrola used ? "Under household activities we have the problem of feeding the family wisely. Many more fruits and vegetables are used in the diet than formerly. An instance is told of a woman who had three con - stants on her her table, crackers, catsup and onions. I think cafeterias are an education to the people. I find that over the country more people drink milk than formerly. A man once said that he liked to see his food before he ate it. The homemakers have been told to have two fresh vegetables a day. Another problem under household activities is clothing the family. We have learned more about color and line. We have been told how line, color and silhouette all enter into the selection of a dress. We know the feel of goods. Very often the homemakers could put the sewing off because that was one thing that could be put off. They could have a woman come in and make the clothing. The men could get their clothing to fit more satisfactorily at the store than when made at home. Women were glad they could send the men to the store for their clothing. "Another problem under household activities is the maintenance of health. The homemaker needs to know what foods help to maintain health. We begin early to establish good food habits in children. "Then we have the problem of maintaining social life. This is something we must do for the children and for the grown-ups. There are difficulties involved in maintaining social life. In this day there are so many clubs. Father belongs to a club, mother has her club and even the children have this and that club, until finally members of the family will meet each other at the gate — one coming home from club and the other one going. This question of social life is a mighty big question." •■;.■ . . </seg>

Miss Mary Mason, equipment. Miss Bernice Elwell, institutional management. Miss Grace Margaret Morton, textiles and clothing. Miss Rebekah Gibbons, food. Each spoke briefly and expressed a desire that all visit the depart - ments they were representing. The Home Economics Club supplied the group with guides for the visits to the various departments where interesting and attractive exhibits had been arranged. The Family Fun Feed was held at 5:30 Wednesday evening. ■ The last meeting of the Home . Economics section opened at 9:30 on Thursday, January 10th, with the president presiding. A group of numbers were sung by Miss Louise Hauser, accompanied by Marguerite Kirschier. They were: "My Laddie" Thayer "A Memory" .Ganz "The Old Refrain" Kreisler Miss Isabel Bevier concluded her- series of talks with "The Far Reaching Influence of the Farm Home." "I will try and sum up the farm home. I put a great deal of ex - pression on the purpose. It is not only a place to sleep in and work in. We live by love, play, work and worship. You must have some under - standing as to the goal. "I would like to. have a definite understanding between the man ■ and woman in the farm home. Don't make the farm a: temporary place and go to the city later. If you do not enjoy the days as they go by, you will not know how to enjoy them when you are old. "It makes a good deal of 'difference as to the things we work with We need -an attractive setting. If you have a fence around the house, where you can keep the lower animals from the higher, that is an im - portant thing on the farm. ' ; "The next thing I want to discuss is the farm family.

What the income is will determine how it is to be spent. There is a good deal of income in the family that is not money at all. It is a partnership of brains, of self-denial and cheer. "Do not let mother maintain the social life. I would like to have father contribute his share. The chores are a way of teaching the children their responsibility. What is going to happen at meal time. It is one time of day when all are together. Tell the news you have at the meal; if you have been to town, tell the news you heard. There ought to be a feeling that people should come to the table in their best appearance. "The contribution to social, civic and moral life. We need a com - munity center. A community is responsible for the people in it. We have a very definite attitude toward music. This is the contribution of books. There is so much good literature. Perhaps we do not read as much as we used to. There is quite a question as to whether they are helped as much by reading as by going places more as they do now. If we are going to keep growing and living,' we must be active. The radio brings some of the best things to us. The farm people must have recreation. Is the car something that is taking the family, or just one or two? We learned in war time the need of good supervised play and recreation. . People should use their home as the best expres - sion of their self. If you have a home, you should work hard for it at all times." ■ ' .

The requirements for the nomination of women for this honor are that the women named must be real farm women, carrying on actively in a farm home and with an income derived from the farm and her nomination blank must be signed by five persons. Following the business meeting and announcements, Mr. E. A. Marshall gave an illustrated talk on The Home Grounds. He spoke as follows: "There was not very much landscaping before the war. It is some - thing which has been just recently developed. Mr. and Mrs. Green did not know anything about landscaping. They lived in an apartment in the city. They did not need to know anything about it, as they lived in an apartment with three other families and they did not have any </seg>
            <seg id="p410">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE space for plants and flowers. They were getting along quite well in their apartment until one of their neighbors took in boarders. That was too much for Mr. and Mrs. Green, so they decided to build a home of their own. No one ever buys a house or a lot where he is going to lose money. You want to build a house and put character in the house so that when you are through with it some one else wants it. In fact they will want it before you are through with it. Green did not know very much about building a house, but he set out to build a bungalow in the suburbs. (Places picture of bungalow on map which has previ - ously been hung.) Before he has it finished he finds it is costing him much more than he expected; he had not calculated the cost. "Green beautified the yard like others did. (Places some trash in front yard.) When we want to plant something in the yard we ought to find out what the plants require. You put something in the hot. sun that requires shade and then you wonder why it is that it dies. Most plants require sunshine. You place a plant in sandy soil that requires clay and then find out it does not do well. There is not a catalogue in America that does not say what the plants require. Which reminds us of the man who did not know what to plant so he planted everything. He planted lima beans, but instead of beans coming up, large stalks appeared, and so he decided he must have placed the beans upside down. In like manner was Mr. Green inefficient, because as a child he had not been trained to know plants. Ladies usually know more about plants. Mrs. Green was an ambitious woman, so she put chickens in the front yard. Green was also ambitious. He was so busy when the lawn needed mowing he could not take the time to mow it, so one day he bought a mower which he did not need to push. (Places the picture of a cow on the map.) "The front yard tells a story and the story it tells is the character of the people on the inside of the home. Down on the other side of town there is a house and as you go along you see in the yard nothing but soup bones and sticks. So in your own yard you know the front yard tells a story. While I was traveling in the east I met a man whose business it was to do house to house canvassing. He said, "When a front yard does not show intelligence, I don't go in," so you see the front yard is an advertising place. I am advertising my taste in the front yard. Incidentally, if you want to be free from agents keep a bad looking front yard. "Mr. Green had to move because the mortgage came due. He had an auto, but he did not keep money enough to pay for his home. As a child he had not been taught plant knowledge and what value trees and plants can add to a house. All one's life one can enjoy plant life. The association of plants and plant pathology is one of the most marvel- </seg>
            <seg id="p411">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION ous things in the child life. Mr. Green had to sell his house because he did not know how to take care of it. He sold it to Mr. and Mrs. Wise for much less than it had cost him. They knew the value of things. They knew the front yard was no place for chickens. The front yard is the place to raise children. The first thing they did was to make the house attractive with vines. They put in a walk. They planted roses, shrubs and vines. In developing a house into a home, first frame the door with vines or plants. (Places vines around the door.) It holds your interest and there centralizes your interest. Be careful to have something on each side of the front door. Folks can't help but have their attention focused on the front door. Have your plantings balanced. "In the sun parlor if you have a window out of which you frequently look put something there to look at, so you see you have something pretty. In developing your home take a look out of every window of your house and try to visualize something out there so that it will be attractive. In planting trees be careful to plant trees so that they do not block the view from the windows. If there is an unsightly view you can block it out with a tree. Mr. Green woke up to the fact that when you are selling a house you will need to get accustomed to the fact of. not having it run down. You want a home not only a roof over your head, you want a home with children. I "A grocer had a home and he achieved a very desirable effect by planting. The people in the town began talking about him and making all manner of fun about him, but they were curious about what he was doing, nevertheless. He was a grocer, what did he know about a home and plants? After some time, however, the people began to realize how much pleasure he was giving to his neighbors by having such an attractive home. They said if he will treat his neighbors like that he will treat his customers that same way. Since then his store has had to have twenty clerks to run its business. If you see an old house you wonder who lives there. You say he does not care for his family. He does not love his children. Childhood is a period for character forming and a child that is brought up in a home that is not worth anything will seldom make a mark in life. There is a place in Pennsylvania where at one time there were three old men in the town who would not let the people plant any trees, not even in the cemetery. The place was just a barren, uninteresting place.' The children going out of this town will be content to live in a weed patch all their lives. "Mr. and Mrs. Wise, after living in their bungalow for some time, had to sell it because the place was not large enough. The children were growing up. They did not lose money on their transaction. They made money. All they had done was to develop the home. </seg>
            <seg id="p412">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE "In Cleveland where I lectured a landscape man said this: A year ago he was up to the club one night and he met a real estate man who had a house which would not sell. The landscape man offered to do some landscaping and he said, 'No, I can't sell it now.' But the land - scape man went out to the house anyway. When the landscaping was done the house was sold. "Mr. and Mrs. Wise bought a large ten-room house. It was a Colonial house and aunty came to see them. (Places a picture of a Colonial house on map.) After they had bought it they wanted to change it so that it would individualize it. The first thing they did was to change the porch, putting a little more attractive porch on. (Changes porch.) They built a walk running' down from the house to the highway so their friends would not get their feet muddy when they came to visit. Then they added a driveway for the automobile (illus - tration). They added a cover for the driveway near the house and ran the driveway down to the street. The next thing they did was to build a sun parlor. (Places illustration.) They had the same idea that so many other folks have about sun parlors. The sun parlor is good the year around, not only good in winter. Then they made corner plantings. Always remember to have your corner plantings broken. They put a rock garden and a lily pond in the back yard. Balance these on the other side so, on the other side, have ' a windbreak. When you are developing a windbreak in this way, I would advise something in front of it in the way of shrubs. Have shrubs which will give you colors in front of the evergreens. Have shrubs which will be blooming all the year. Plan for something which will bloom all the time. In front of the shrubs have a perennial border. Divide it into sections. Put some - thing in each section that will bloom . in May, June, July and August. In this way you have always something that will be blooming. Build a pergola in the back yard, have it related to something. Build a tea house next to the pergola. Cover it with wisteria. Then have tea toses nearby. (Places illustrations.) Balance is exceedingly important in planning a yard. Build, a trellis on the other side of the house and cover it with grape vines. In this way a screen is provided for the clothes line. Build a playhouse for the children. (Places evergreens near the house.) What is wrong with this planting? It is a wild planting near a domestic dwelling and we must change it. (Changes it.) In planting evergreens you must not let the roots become dry. Ever - greens must be very carefully taken care of. I will say now a little about the use of trees. Trees are exceedingly valuable and I wish that Nebraska could be planted with trees like Canada is planted with maple. It is 20 per cent cooler when planted with trees than otherwise. Real estate promoters now plant trees to add value to property. Trees take dust out of the air. Trees are beneficial from the health stand - point. You know how well you feel when you are in the woods. The </seg>
            <seg id="p413">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION reason for this is that trees give off oxygen which we breathe and use carbon dioxide which is in the air. People must know how to take care of trees. Trees help to make a home attractive. The home is not for children only, but for adults also. We do not realize the value of a home for children and the effect on a child who once becomes inoculated with the pride of a home. Gives people pride with a good home. The way to get children to work in the garden is to work there with them. If the man enjoys the home the boy will enjoy it also. The love of flowers and the love of birds can be instilled in the child and is some - thing that will be in the child's heart that you can not take away. If the boy knows something about the garden plants he will enjoy working there. If he knows something about the Irish potato and Boston ivy and the onion it will not seem like drudgery to work among the plants. So we can take the very shrubs and make the child interested in these things. (Puts on a picture of the flag.) The picture is not complete without the plant whose colors never die, the red, white and blue. The way to do is to have a bird'seye view of your plant. Go and sit on your neighbor's porch for a month and study your home. If you don't know plants, go about the homes in the community and get the names of the plants, the best looking plants, and make different lists. Sit down and : make your design. First thing you know you will be a landscaper. Two lines you will need to watch, the sky line and the base line. Break them. Tall plants can be put at doors, between windows. Low plants are put under the windows. Break your line at the bottom. Under the window have low plants." In the absence of Director W. H. Brokaw, Dean Burr took charge of the recognition service of County Project Group Chairmen. He spoke briefly on the progress made in agriculture and connected it with the opportunities in leadership for farm women. Miss Mary-Ellen Brown called the names of the chairmen present, who came forward and were presented with pins in behalf of the Home Economics Section of Organized Agriculture. Mrs. S. P.

            <seg id="p414">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE PART II MOTHERS' VACATION CAMPS Mothers' Vacation Camps continue to be popular in Nebraska. Dur - ing the past summer four district camps were held, two in June and two in August. To make these camps available to women in different parts of the state three of the camps were held in new locations. The camps were as follows: Seward — at park — June 12 to IB — thirty-three enrolled. Sidney — Kreuger's Lake — June 17 to 20 — thirty-six enrolled. Dannebrog— at park — August 7 to 10 — fifty enrolled. Camp Brewster — one mile south of Omaha — August 14 to 17 — sev - enty-three enrolled. The same general plans followed in former years were used. The county agents made suggestions about camp sites which would be con - venint for the women. During February and March the locations were definitely arranged. Following this the specialists talked over plans and enrollments with the local leaders in their monthly project meet - ings. News items about the camps were published. The county agents helped in preparing the camp and also assisted the last day. The camps furnished three days of rest, fun and recreation for busy home makers. They opened on Tuesday afternoon and lasted until Friday afternoon. Visitors were not allowed in camp until Friday, when many of the families and friends of the campers came to enjoy the camp and the speakers. The camps were held in buildings. The cots and cooking utensils, which were furnished by the Extension Service, were transported by a truck from camp to camp. The women brought their own bedding and dishes except at Camp Brewster, where everything was furnished. Miss Leona Davis, who is now home demonstration agent in Custer county, served as finance secretary. She handled all of the money, purchased the supplies and paid the bills. She planned the menus and had supervision of the meals. The cook, Mrs. Anna Edmiston, and her assistant prepared the meals. The campers enjoyed not knowing what they were to eat until the food was served. After the camps were over the menus and recipes were mimeographed and sent to each camper. Copies of these may be secured by sending to the Agricultural Exten - sion Service, Lincoln, Nebr. The following article, written by Mrs. W. J. Barnes and published in the "Phonograph," St. Paul, Nebr., August 29, 1928, gives an ex- </seg>
            <seg id="p415">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION cellent description of camp life. The other camps were similar to this one except in some cases there were different speakers. For example, at the Seward and Brewster camps, Mr.. T. C. Diers, University radio announcer, gave a talk on "Songs of Yesterday and Today." At Kreuger's Lake, where the camp was held six miles east of Sidney, Mr. N. W. Gaines, the Extension community specialist, gave a talk on "The Home and the Community." Director Brokaw also appeared on some of the camp programs and used the topic "Why I Am Glad I Live in Nebraska." At the Seward camp, Mrs. J. P. Senning, who is the chairman of the Efficiency in Government Division of the Nebraska League of Women Voters, gave three talks. Her topics were "How a Nebraska County Cares for Its Poor," "Property Rights of Women," and "Our County Officers and Their Jobs." At this camp, round table discussions were conducted by- Mrs. Eva Morse, who has charge of the Parental Education in Omaha. She discussed the "Power of Suggestion to a Child," "The Need of Dealing Frankly With Sex Questions" and "Problems of Discipline." The article follows: "The Central Nebraska Mothers Vacation Camp was held at Danne - brog, August 7, 8, 9, 10, with fifty women present from eight counties who are taking the Extension project work, besides the 'crew,' including Miss Mary-Ellen Brown, state extension agent of women's work; Miss Jessie Hoover, Miss Leona Davis, Miss Helen Rocke, Mrs. N. W. Gaines, Mrs. C. O. Bruce, Mrs. Florence Williams, the 'Aunt Betty* of the Ne - braska Farmer, and Mrs. Edmiston of Lincoln, and Mrs. Sorensen and daughter of Dannebrog, who looked after all our needs while in camp. "When we arrived in camp we were met by Mary-Ellen Brown, who gave us a smiling welcome and then directed us to Leona Davis, who looked after registration, and Miss Helen Rocke, who was our project leader last year, assigned us to our quarters. After we had unpacked and made up our cots and looked around to see how many of the old acquaintances were in camp, the whistle ('the arbiter of our destinies' while in camp) blew, one note to tell us that there was 'some - thing doing' and two blasts to tell us it 'had begun.' We followed the sound of the whistle out under the shade trees and proceeded with the 'Know Your Neighbors' game. The first day we had our names pinned on the front of our dresses, the second on our backs and by the third day we were supposed to know everybody, even to their first names. After we had played a few games to fix the names in our minds, we wound up with 'She Cackles' and 'Going to London,' and by that time the 'ice' was so thoroughly 'cracked' that it soon melted, and a feeling of goodwill and friendship and 'at homeness' remained with us through - out our stay in camp. </seg>
            <seg id="p416">REPOKT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE "At six o'clock the whistle blew for supper and we decided to eat out of doors, and we liked it so well that all our meals were eaten under the trees, tables being provided for that purpose. An amusing incident was the presence of a 'Smith' and a 'Hoover' at our table, and a lot of fun was had with the two 'candidates.' Hoover made herself solid with the ladies before the end of the meal by a treat of ice cream, which was very welcome that hot evening. "After supper we were gathered in a group and a vesper service held and the words of those old favorites, Little Brown Church in the Vale, A Perfect Day, and just as the sun set in a flood of crimson, Day is Dying in the West, were reverently sung. "Miss Hoover, who had been sent to us through the courtesy of Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., gave us an instructive talk on 'Curtains That Are Attractive and Durable,' illustrated by a large number of curtains in miniature, besides having many samples to illustrate 'the thing' in curtains. Her part in the program was very practical and was much appreciated by the home-makers. . It is planned to make a project lesson on curtains such as Miss Hoover gave us, and have it included in the new 'Homemaking' project. "As darkness fell we went inside and Mrs. Laura Gaines gave us a splendid taljc on 'The Silent Influence of Sacred Music' She spoke of the silent influence of a sacred life, and said that all are giving out an influence all the time, either for good or evil. We have to live a long time before we realize the sweet influence of the home and of the sacred songs we have heard there. She illustrated her talk by singing some of the songs which had greatly influenced her life, in which singing she asked us to join. "As usual the first night in camp, it took a little while to 'settle down' and adjust ourselves to the unaccustomed hardness -of the camp cots, and the strange surroundings. Those who were wise had brought extra bedding to make their cots more comfortable. It was decided to arise at 6:30 a. m., but before that hour every morning many of the women who had come to 'rest' were up and out exploring the neighbor - hood, and taking an invigorating morning ramble. At seven o'clock the whistle blew for gymnastic exercises. Although it was not obliga-. tory to take them, most of the women were good sports and took part in everything that came along. Breakfast was at 7:30 and with our trays and dishes in hand we lined . up and were served, first saying grace in unison which was given to us on a printed card. At the end of the week we were given the whole set for use in our own homes. While we lingered at the table (we were in our vacation so did not have to hurry with the dishwashing) Miss Brown asked each one to rise and tell where we had received our education up to the eighth </seg>
            <seg id="p417">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION grade, but first the crowd must tell the name of the person standing. And some of the women had very good memories, especially when they were sitting where they could see the name on the back. We didn't have that advantage the third day, but the response was usually very good. Many found that they had mutual acquaintances or come from the same state or community by this method. Not many will forget the action song, Under the Spreading Chestnut Tree, we learned the first morning in camp, nor the fun we had with it many times after - wards. "The dishwashing was no hardship, as Miss Davis made a game of it, and had nine different 'ways of choosing who would get the coveted first chance. Wednesday morning Mrs. Bruce, a mother herself and a (young) grandmother, discussed Mother's Problems With Little People. She talked of the different temperaments, the abnormal child, the timid, restless, nervous, " sulky, stubborn, whiny, selfish and sickly and of I methods and ways of dealing with them for the best good of the child. i A number of magazines which print articles on child training were recommended. She recommended that the Mother Goose stories be taught to the tiny tots and that they derive much enjoyment from the right kind of fairy stories. "The next period was Enjoying Color, by Miss Hoover. Under her direction we made color charts, studying the different shades and the proper color combinations. She told us how to use the charts in choos - ing our clothing and in choosing the correct color schemes in the fur - nishings of our homes. "After a short intermission, dinner was served and Miss Brown requested that as a means of promoting acquaintances and sociability no one should sit by the same person twice, under a penalty of a fine. No one had to pay a fine, however. Always after dinner we enjoyed a 'quiet hour,' when one could sleep, read or write, or visit together or do a little shopping. "At 2 p. m. the sound of the whistle brought us together to meet Mrs. Florence Williams, the 'Aunt Betty' of the Nebraska Farmer. We had expected to see a stout, 'motherly' woman, but were surprised to see a very pretty young- woman with snappy brown eyes and a very expressive countenance. She talked about 'Questions That Women Are Asking the Nebraska Farmer,' which range all the way from What ■ birds lay the largest and smallest eggs in the world, to what is the best way to finish floors and 'making pickles.' A round table discussion followed and many useful household hints and helps were exchanged and visiting and resting until supper time. </seg>
            <seg id="p418">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE \ . • ■ _ ' _ •■ . ■' • / • ■ ■ ■ ' ■ ■ ■ "Wednesday evening the ladies were entertained for two hours by a very fine program put on by the Dannebrog people, consisting of several numbers sung by the Dannebrog male quartet, several selec - tions by the orchestra, a saxophone solo and vocal numbers. The pro - gram was very much appreciated as well as the courtesy of the Danne - brog people in providing such a splendid entertainment. After they had gone Mrs. Bruce and Mrs. Gaines pleased the audience with another hour of story and song. "Thursday morning Mrs. Gaines' subjeet was 'Sing Happiness Into Your Home.' Home is the most important institution in the world, she said, and the product of the home should be well balanced, men - tally, morally, physically and spiritually. Next to religion, the home influence is the strongest thing for good in the world. She advocated more singing by the family as a group, and told of many incidents in her experience of the value of singing in the home. One cannot sing and hold cne of the lower moods, but you can sing yourself out of it. 'Music hath charms to soothe the savage breast.' The singing of a cheerful song when everything goes wrong and all the world is blue will hearten us up and change the indigo to a rosy hue, and' we will feel that the world is a pretty good place to live in after all. The 'experience meeting' which followed was one' of the best hours we spent together. Each one told of their mother's favorite song and of the memories it recalled and the influence it had on their life. Some - times it was the father who was the singer, but almost invariably it was a religious song, the memory of which was most deeply impressed upon our minds and hearts. Mrs. Gaines asked us the question, What will your children remember that you sang? Some one answered 'Blue Heaven,' or something equally jazzy. There is food for thought in that question in this day of jazz and the radio, and 'there is more truth than poetry' in the answer she received. Mrs. Jennie Bruce had the next period, 'Your Child of 9, 10 or 11.' This is known as the 'transition' period and the fatigue years. Prob - lems of child training were discussed by the group, and many helpful ideas presented. Among the books and magazines recommended for those ages were The Youth's Companion, Five Little Peppers, My Book House and the Book of Knowledge. The Alger books were put under a ban as being too exaggerated and unwholesome. The importance of the 4-H club work for these ages was emphasized, for if they don't belong to a club more than likely they'll belong to a 'gang.' Thursday afternccn was all taken up with preparation for our fun night, each section of eight women preparing for a stunt, and each county com - posing a song contest. "Supper was at 5:30 that evening and at 6:30 we were all given a 'joy ride' by the Dannebrog Community Club. Sixteen cars had been </seg>
            <seg id="p419">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION provided for our use, traveling in four sections, and we were taken all over the pretty little town of Dannebrog and south and west of town for miles where we viewed the fertile Oak Creek and the Middle Loup valleys. We were taken to Nysted and all were treated to a cooling drink of ice cold pop. While there we were invited to go through the Lutheran church to see the beautiful hand carvings on the pulpit From Nysted we returned to Dannebrog by another road, viewing some more of that beautiful rural neighborhood, which showed such fine prospects for a bountiful crop. We certainly appreciated the fine ride, as well as the thoughtfulness and hospitality of the Dannebrog people We were never treated so well by a community before while in camp and we certainly appreciated it. The evening's program began with a song contest, the counties being called upon alphabetically, Antelope, Adams, Buffalo, Clay, Custer, Garfield, Hall and Howard. We were judged upon several points. The approach, the attack, general appearance harmony, originality and retreat. We are very proud to state that for the third time m succession Howard county carried off the honors and [won the contest. "Then followed the stunts, which were very clever as well as amus - ing. It almost seemed selfish to keep all that fun to ourselves, but that is the rule. It was pretty late when we got through and settled flown for the night. "As the sound of the music, awakened us on Friday morning it was with a mingled feeling of joy and regret, joy that we would soon be with beloved families again, and regret that our pleasant and profit - able days in camp were almost at an end. "As we sat about the table that last morning, Miss Brown asked us to tell of some of the courtesies that our mothers had taught us and again our minds reverted to our childhood and as we told of the many things our mothers had taught us, we thought how much the practice of those little courtesies added to the enjoyment of our lives. "Mrs. Bruce began her last period on 'That Teen Age' by reading several selections from the book, The Path to Home, by Edgar Guest. The teen age has been described as the storm and stress period of life, a good name for it It takes an infinite amount of patience to deal with them. She said that if we did not want them out nights, we must manufacture something else. to take the place of it. Have lots of good reading, music and invite in their young friends. If they do things or say things they shouldn't, just wait awhile. They are a good deal like the Nebraska weather. If you don't like the weather, just wait awhile, it will change. And remember the way -you meet the problems of life they will meet them. A better understanding of the child and </seg>
            <seg id="p420">REPORT OK NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ' the solution of many problems was brought out in the talks and illus - trated by songs. "Everyone was much interested in Mrs. Gaines' talk, which was on lessons we have learned from music. The musical education of the child begins in the cradle and from the lullabies and songs they hear while in the mother's arms. Their lives will be greatly influenced by the songs they sing or hear sung. We should shut down on the sug - gestive jazz song and train them to love those which give us good thoughts and feelings. "By three o'clock the women began to leave for their homes, every - one a booster for Mother's Vacation Camp, and Dannebrog. At each session some new thought or inspiration had been gained, and we had learned much by exchanging thoughts and experiences with women from the many different homes and communities. Before leaving many kodak pictures were taken of the group and ' of county groups. It is the plan to meet at Dannebrog again next year, a'nd 100 women can easily be accommodated. Those who have .been at camp want to go again, they get the habit, and those who have never been don't know what great benefits they have missed." PART III 4-H CLUBS The Home Economics Section of Organized Agriculture recognizes the value of 4-H club work in the early training of girls toward be - coming successful homemakers and valuable citizens. One phase of this work which helps the girls to weigh values, establish and recognize standards, and to develop judgment is the judging contest. These contests are held during the State Fair for the 4-H club girls of the state. The Home Economics Section gave one hundred dollars for the promotion of this part of club work. This was used to send the highest scoring girl in the food contest and the clothing contest to the Seventh National Club Congress in Chicago. Here the girls entered the national judging contests. The following letters help one to realize the value of such experiences in a girl's life, and they express the appreciation cf the girls who won the trips: Albion, Nebr., Dec. 12, 1928.

            <seg id="p421">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION enjoyed it so I am thanking you, as it was you who made it possible for me to make the trip. Yours truly, RUTH CHILDS. As most of the Nebraska delegation assembled at Omaha, I'll tell of our trip from there. We left Omaha Saturday evening at about 6 o'clock and arrived in Chicago the next morning at 7:20 o'clock. We went to the Central Church for church services where they were giving special recognition to the 4-H clubs. After lunch Mr. Frisbie made arrangements for us to take about a fifty-mile ride around the city. This trip proved to be very interesting and educational. We were shown some of the out - standing buildings, the tallest one, the cleanest one which was Wrig - ley's and being cleaned twice a year, some of the buildings not yet \ completed, also the buildings still remaining, after the big fire in Chicago. These are used for nothing except relics. We were taken through Lincoln Park, which is very beautiful. In Garfield Park we went through the great conservatory in which we were shown some of the rare plants, and from here we were taken through a tenement district, also from a wealthy district to a poor district to show the contrast. We attended the First Methodist Church that night, which also gave special recognition to the 4-H clubs by a welcome by a Chicago boy and response by a 4-H club boy. Monday, as that was the day for most of the contests, was spent at the exposition grounds and those who were not in the contests en - tertained themselves by looking at the exhibits. At 4 o'clock we left the grounds for Thomas E. Wilson's packing plant, where we were entertained by moving pictures, vaudeville and other varieties of amuse - ment, after which we were served a banquet. At 9 o'clock we went back to the grounds, where the clubs had a parade in the arena. Tuesday, Battalion 1 went to Armour and Company and Battalion 2 to Swift and Company's packing plant, after which both battalions assembled and went to the Morrison hotel, where a banquet luncheon was served by courtesy of the National Livestock Producers' Associa - tion to all delegates and leaders. After the banquet we went to the art institute, which was very educational. That evening the club mem - bers' own banquet and annual rally was held at the Sherman hotel. Addresses were given by several men and some of the winnings were announced. On Wednesday the boys and girls were separated, the girls going first to Montgomery Ward and Company and then to the model farm (13.) </seg>
            <seg id="p422">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE at Mundelein, 111. The things of special interest to me were the electric conveniences found in the kitchen. After going through these buildings we went back to the train on which we came, where we were served luncheon as guests of the Public Service Company of Northern Illinois, then returning to the livestock show where a special matinee horse show was being given. The boys went to the Corn Products Refining Company in the morning, returning in the afternoon to see the matinee horse show. A party was held in the evening on. the nineteenth floor of the LaSalle Hotel for all club members and their leaders. It was a costume party and there were many clever costumes made up of sheets, curtains, or lamp shades. Thursday we went to the plant of the International Harvester Com - pany. Here we saw the red hot iron being poured into moulds and also saw them putting other pieces of iron into shape. We also went through the part where the twine was being made. In the afternoon, after eating luncheon as the guests of the International Harvester Com - pany, we went to the Field Museum. What impressed me most here was the realness of everything. The birds and animals all looked as if they were still alive. The whole trip was educational and not only that, I had a wonderful time besides. I don't feel I missed anything from my school work for staying out that week, for I feel that the trip did me more good than three weeks, or even more, of school would do me. RUTH CHILDS.

Dear Miss Rocke: I wish to thank you as secretary of the Home Economics Section of Organized Agriculture for making it possible for me to attend the Seventh National Boys and Girls Club Congress held at Chicago from December 1 to 8, 1928. I want you to know that I had a most wonderful time and enjoyed every minute of the trip and that I saw many educational and worth while things, many of which I shall never forget. • ...

            <seg id="p423">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION MY CHICAGO TRIP The Nebraska delegation left Omaha, Saturday evening, December 1st, 1928, for the Seventh National Boys and Girls Club Congress which was held in Chicago from December 1 to 8. Everyone was full of pep and enthusiasm and anxious to see what the coming week held in store for them. Saturday night songs were practiced which we intended to sing during the week and Mr. Frisbie gave us a brief outline of some of the things we were to do upon our arrival in Chicago. Upon arrival at. our destination Sunday morning we were taken to the La Salle hotel, which was the general headquarters for the week and where the Nebraska delegation stayed. . After everyone had been registered and assigned to their room, all 4-H clubbers were to again meet and register for the week. At that time we were given a detailed program for the week and a badge which we wore at all times. After registration the group of club folks adjourned to the Central Church for the morning services and heard the sermon as broadcast from station WNER. That evening we attended special services at the Methodist Episcopal Church, at which time 4-H folks were greeted by a Chicago boy and a response given by a club boy. A short talk fol - lowed by the state leader, T. T. Martin. Sunday afternoon special busses assembled at the hotel and we were taken for a fifty-mile tour about Chicago. Guides accompanied the group explaining the many interesting points about the city. We were told that the business and financial part of Chicago covers an area of thirty-five square miles and is located in what is called the ; loup section of the city. It is given this name because of the elevated structure which completely encloses the area. State and Madison street is the busiest street in the world. When traveling in cars one is hardly safe if he drives less than thirty-five miles an hour. Although the traffic is extremely great at all times, it is worse about 4 P. M., at which time cars are able to move but about two feet at a time. Most of the homes are in apartment houses which are much dark - ened by smoke. One very seldom sees an ordinary dwelling house such as we see in Nebraska. The Palmer House, Drake, Blackstone, Sherman, Morrison and Stevens hotels were some of the hotels we saw. The Drake is said to be the most exclusive hotel in Chicago and the Stevens is the largest in the world, having 3000 rooms, all of which face the outside. One of the buildings, because of its height of forty-two stories and its narrowness, is called the toothpick building. The Elanzo, which </seg>
            <seg id="p424">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OK AGRICULTURE is forty-seven stories high, is the tallest building in Chicago and the second highest in the world. The Wrigley building, where chewing gum is made, is snow white and is the cleanest building in Chicago, which looks very queer being surrounded by so many darkened build - ings. Many of the people enjoy horseback riding as a sport and because of this one notices very narrow paths along much of the driveway. These are bridle paths and are kept up by the city. A few of the wealthier people own their own horses, but in most cases they are rented from the city. The city of Chicago contains 205 public parks. Lincoln Park, being the largest, contains 685 acres and Humboldt Park being the most beau - tiful. All the parks have artificial lagoons which are used for boating and swimming in the summer and skating in the winter. In the Gar - field Park conservatory was to be found 53,000 different plants which come from all parts of the world. Among them were palm, rubber, banana, bamboo and -castor oil trees. A sensitive plant which came from Brazil and when touched wilted and in a few moments revived. A very peculiar plant from Porto Rico was a curtain vine, which looked very much like many strings attached to the roof of the building. There was in that building 541 varieties of chrysanthemums and sixty varieties of orchids. To purify the drinking water of the city a drainage canal was made and the Chicago river made to flow backward, which is the only river known to flow that way. Monday morning we went to the International Livestock Exposition, led by Mr. J. W. Whitehouse. Upon arriving there we assembled before the Boys' and Girls' Club building and were welcomed by Mr. B. H. Heide, general manager of the International Livestock Exposition. After that most of the day was spent in judging. Those who did not enter judging contests visited the departments of the International. Monday evening we were entertained by the Thomas E. Wilson Packing Company from 4 until 8:30 P. M. At the end of this time we returned to the show and paraded in the arena. Awards were made to winners in judging contests at that time and other champions were recognized. Tuesday forenoon was packing house and stockyards day. Part of the group was entertained by Armour and Company and part by Swift and Company at breakfast and then a program. Following that we were taken on a specially conducted tour through the packing plants. In the afternoon we visited the Art Institute of Chicago, which is the largest art building in the country. At that time we were furnished </seg>
            <seg id="p425">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION guides who told us about many of the famous paintings and the artists, besides showing us some of the beautiful glass and silver ware and gold articles. On Wednesday morning motor coaches, which were furnished by the Public Service Company of Illinois, called for the girls and took us to the Montgomery Ward plant where we. were entertained at break - fast, followed by a program. At that time winners of the Montgomery Ward trips were recognized and presented with a special gift of a cook book and recipe file. After the program we were taken on a trip through the house to points of special interest which included the shoe division, testing merchandise, index of customers' names, copying cus - tomers' orders, the dispatch, United States postoffice, the export de - partment where goods were ready to be sent to all parts of the world, the retail store, and last we were shown the pictures of Mr. Ward and Mr. Thome, who were founders of Montgomery Ward and Company in 1872. After this tour we left for the model farm at Mundelein, Illinois, which is owned by the Public Service Company of Northern Illinois. On this farm we saw many of the modern conveniences which are used in and about the home. We found that a great part of it was run by electricity. A short time was spent that afternoon in watching the Horse Show, which was very wonderful. There we saw many beautiful horses in all classes from different parts of the United States. Wednesday evening 4-H clubbers, attired in comical costumes, as - sembled at the headquarters hotel for a party. Games, stunts and songs formed the evening's entertainment. During the morning of the last day, which was Thursday, the club folks went to the International Harvester Company where machinery was being made. Thursday afternoon we visited the wonderful Field Museum, which was donated by Marshall Field III. There we saw many different kinds of fish, birds, animals and skeletons, besides many of the costumes, homes and ideas of the Indians, Chinese, Japanese, and Filipinos. We noticed that workmen were busy preparing some new cases for exhibits. ■ That night, after attending the last banquet of the week, which was at the Palmer House Hotel, we left for home and arrived here Friday night after having had a most wonderful time at the Club Congress. Although we had a wonderful time, I'm sure we all appre - ciate our old state of Nebraska just a little more than we did before seeing Chicago, the third city of the world and the second of the United States.

            <seg id="p428">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE and instructive talk, "Building- a Book House," which was illustrated by many beautiful books from the library. She said in part as follows: "I wish to compare the building of a house with the building in our lives of books. I came from a state where native stone was used to build foundations; the foundations were built high and wide, with thick walls. The cellars were warm, keeping out cold; fruit and vegetables never froze. Correspondingly, the houses built on these foundations were substantial and stood the storms of many years. Later in Ne - braska I lived in quite another kind of house. There was no foundation; it was built hastily and of poor material. That house could not last long. A good deal should be said of the soil upon which the foundation is laid. A house that is built on the sand can not long endure. If the soil is not stable, we should put something stable into it. For example,' take the St. Francis dam in California which, though of massive size and good foundation, was situated on poor soil. Another example is the new capitol at Lincoln. People who see it say 'How slowly they are progressing; there seems to be nothing happening,' and they be - come impatient. When getting ready for the tower, 'which now shows, they are working fifty feet underground, securing a good foundation, that being the only wise way to build. So I hope I may be able to visualize to you something of what it means to build a good foundation in reading. "My work takes me over the state. In visiting the libraries of the state as I went from place to place, I was very much impressed. In many places our children's departments were not up to the standard I would like them to be. It became a burden to me because I felt that those librarians who were leaders of children, as well as the children, were missing a wonderful opportunity. "I prepared an exhibit showing two houses of books. The one was built on sand, which was so unstable that it had to be held in place by laths. I had taken some of the books that I knew people were buying in great numbers — libraries, homes, and schools — they were cheap, plentiful, easy to give as gifts, and they flooded the country. Then I went to the marble works in Lincoln and secured some slabs cf marble. On this foundation of marble I built another house of books. It is of these books I wish to talk. These books will help in the building of a stable character. I have here a list of forty books compiled by the National Education Society for children under 16 years of age. Some of them are the good, old time titles which are stable and a' few more modern." Miss Williams distributed the following list: Forty books all children under sixteen should have read.

            <seg id="p431"/>
            <seg id="p432">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Miss Williams then read to us a delightful fable which she had written which very clearly brought to mind the point that children need help in choosing their reading. "There is not always someone to give the child the- right books to read. People say that the poorer books do not hurt them, that they will not find it out, and what matter does it make. But there isn't time to read it all — not even all the good things, and I feel that it does make a difference. Mothers feel that way about the children's food. They are careful to give them, things that are good for them all of the time, and I feel that way about books. I am afraid that if they do not get these particular things at a certain time, that they will never get them, unless read when little children. Lots of us read them when we get older, but we miss so much by not having had them when we were young. For example, take the book 'Alice in Wonderland.' You feel a distinct loss if you do not know what they are talking about when they mention the dodo bird, because you missed it when you were small. It is just a little about types of books — the different sort of things I want to talk about. "I feel quite strongly, about picture books for small children who can not read, who are even too young to ask for books. I believe there are a good many' people who do not know what real art is, as illustrated in good picture books. I think it is too bad that a child has to get his idea of art from the comic sections of the daily paper. Not that I am averse to them seeing these, but I would like to have them have some - thing of real art and the picturing of the things that are being done now. 'Joan of Arc' is done for children by the same famous artist who has a marvelous wall piece, a mural painting, in our institute in Chicago. It shows that people who have wonderful ability have time to give to children's books. So it is with all of these books — they are done by many different famous artists. We used to think of Jessie Wilcox as being the only illustrator for children. We have a long, long list now of the picture editions of these artists. Many of the children's books are illustrated in black and white now, as in silhouettes, which are very popular. If anybody would really wish, I can send you a list. I want you to look over these books and see what they are. Bright colors appeal to children, and in line with the bright colors of today the books are correspondingly made with bright colors." Miss Williams exhibited a splendid line of beautiful children's books, and read two poems for children, "Busy" and "Sneezles." "It is almost impossible to keep up with the books now furnished for adults. That is the wonderful thing about working with children — they do not know nor care if it is new. If it has an appeal it is all right with them. The children like the brightly titled books instead </seg>
            <seg id="p433">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION of the commonplace, uninteresting books of the past, so consider the books you buy. "I feel that every child should have a chance at fairy tales. There are always some people who do not believe in fairy stories for children. I have not been able to get their point, as it is an heritage for the children as they go through this period and it gives them food for thought." An open discussion on the different books followed. Then Miss "Williams asked the next day for further discussion and questions. Next was community singing. ■ Miss Mary-Ellen Brown, state ex - tension agent, gave a very interesting talk- and discussion on "The Word That Describes Your Home." Miss Brown spoke as follows: "Which is the better policy — attempting many things and finishing none of them well or concentrating on a few and making each of them worth while ? This was a question confronting the Extension Service of the Agricultural College. At an annual conference of all the state and county extension agents they decided that better results may be obtained when efforts are well directed on a few definite projects of work. As a result of this study at the conference a slogan of four parts was adopted. "The first part of the slogan was 'More legumes' which had behind it the idea that Nebraska needs to take care of the soil if we are to produce all that we can and still not have the soil wear out. By rotating red clover, alfalfa or sweet clover with other crops the fields can bt made to yield more,. and the greater the yield the more money can be made. We will all agree that we want money. I doubt if any one who is listening to me will say that he or she does not want more money. "Part two of the slogan is 'profitable livestock.' Much is being done by the College of Agriculture,- Extension Service, to increase the profits from livestock. In many cases if a man is to make money from his livestock it is not a matter simply of the number he has, but rather of the methods he employs in selecting, feeding and caring for his stock which will add to the income. "The first and second parts of the- slogan had as their object the making of conditions so that more money could be made, so we will &gt; agree these two parts of the slogan are good ones. The third part takes up another important feature and that is the marketing of the crops or the livestock. If one is to make money from what has been produced it is necessary to market it wisely. More and more stress is </seg>
            <seg id="p434">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE being laid the last few years on marketing and all are finding that it needs* thoughtful consideration, so this third part of the slogan, 'thought - ful marketing,' is a good addition to the rest of it, "This third part of the slogan also has to do -with the making of money and this leads us to think for a few minutes about 'why do we work and try to make more money and more money?' Each of us might answer this question in a different way. Why do you and I work so hard, why do we do it? It is not just to have the money in the bank — a good thing to have we will all agree — but that is not the ulti - mate end. You and I want money because with it we can do much for those we love, especially those in our homes who are dependent upon us. This brings us to the fourth part of the slogan and that is to the place where our money is needed — the home. There are many, words which might be used to describe a home, and then, too, there are various interpretations of any one word which different people give to the word when they stop to analyze what it means to them. If you were to place a word before 'home' to make it mean what your home is to you, what would that word be ? What is the word which best describes your home? "When talking in an informal way to a comparatively small group of women, it has been interesting to have each woman suggest the word that appealed to her as the word which" she felt best described her home. One which is often given among the first is 'model.' Perhaps this is the one you feel describes your home, and it is a good word, al - though much will depend upon how one interprets its meaning. If it means a large, well built house having all the modern improvements, is it necessarily then the home which all enjoy and where guests love to come ? It may be this, but is there not a word that may have a fuller meaning than model? - "Other words that come to your mind at once are no doubt 'happy' or 'beautiful' or 'better' or 'efficient' or 'hospitable.' At a Parent-Teacher Association meeting the other day two especially good words given by the mothers to describe their homes were 'harmonious' and 'satisfac - tory.' Perhaps as you think of your home you will feel that harmonious or satisfactory are the words to describe it. "A group of girls who were trying to select the best word for their homes named several and then finally narrowed them down to two as they studied what each word meant to them. The two words they de - cided upon were 'ideal' and 'comfortable.' The longer they analyzed the words the more the sentiment seemed to be in favor of comfortable. I can't tell which appeals the more to you, but the word finally decided upon by the Extension Service was 'comfortable', so the fourth part of </seg>
            <seg id="p435">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION the slogan was 'comfortable homes'. We usually find this word does not appeal at first, but that it grows more and more in favor the longer it is considered. Some day when you are washing dishes, those same dishes which have to be washed over and over, let your mind spend the time in selecting the word for your home. "May we in the next few minutes spend a little time together in thinking about what makes your home one to which the term 'com - fortable' may be applied. It may not be just as you would like to have it, but you are not letting this make you or the others unhappy, for it is constantly growing nearer and nearer the standard you have set up for it in your mind. Your home is the one which gives you that comfortable feeling, it gives father the feeling that no other man is as fortunate as he because he has the best home, the most comfortable home, the one that rests him and in which he takes the greatest satis - faction. Your home is the one the children enjoy and will always cherish in memory and use as a standard for their own homes later. Let me repeat this last sentence, for much could be added about the effect of the standard set by your home upon the homes of the next generation. Your home is the one the children enjoy and will always cherish in memory and Use as a standard for their own homes later. "Can you think of a finer compliment for guests to give to you and your home than to have them say, 'It is a pleasure to visit you, for your home seems so comfortable and homelike.' "A comfortable home will have children, for no home is complete without them. There will also be books and music. To these we will i add health. To have health there will need to be cleanliness, and good health habits of sleep, fresh air and posture. The food habits will be especially important in keeping the members of the family up to par, not only physically, but also for their dispositions. You no doubt have heard the story of the woman who had been interested in following some food habits which a home demonstration agent had given for boys and girls. One day she came back to the office looking happy and as though she were enjoying life better than before and said the good food habits had helped her boys and girls to get up to weight and it had improved their dispositions so much that it was easier to live with them than before. Then she added, 'Can you now tell me what to do for my husband?' "A woman whose family are 'finicky' about what they eat surely has the sympathy of all of us. If one child has to have food prepared a special way to humor him and another has to have something else especially prepared, how it adds to the duties of the mother. Often such a situation is due to the notions on the part of the different mem - bers of the family, or possibly mother did not know how to tram the </seg>
            <seg id="p436">REPOKT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE boys and girls when they were small and she is more to blame than any one else. Or, it may be father and mother will not eat all kinds of food and the children follow their example. ■ 'In counties where the women have been studying through the home demonstration project given once a month by Miss Florence At - wood, the subject of 'Foods for Health', the women are interested in what may be done along this line to make mother's work easier. • "There are other things found in your comfortable home besides children, books, music and health, for here we will find cheerfulness. There will not be much comfort in a home where mother worries and worries and seldom seems cheerful. When mother is not up to par physically or mentally, what a marked effect it has upon the whole family. A quotation which has. been of help to some of us who have a tendency to worry is this, 'Worry is a Christian's method of suicide.' Would it not be better if we would substitute prayer for worry? An - other good quotation for those who worry is .'Mild worry is more ex - hausting than hard work.' If this is true then when we have a- big day's work before us worry is not going to assist us in going through the day easily. "Your comfortable home is attractive, but this does not depend upon the amount of money which is spent, upon it. Have you not visited a small home in which you knew there had been only a comparatively limited amount of money spent, yet it seemed so attractive and com - fortable that you enjoyed being there? Then, too, have you not been in large homes where much money had been spent and still it was not attractive and it lacked that' feeling of comfort found in the smaller home? Having an attractive home depends upon making the best of what one has and upon the taste and personalities of. the homemaker and her partner. "In a comfortable home the mother will have time for herself and for enjoying the boys and girls through reading and playing with them. To have such time there will need to be efficiency in the home. There will be conveniences which are carefully selected so they are a help in saving labor and time. As a part of an efficient home there will be system about the work so that there may be a spirit of poise and not of hurry, hurry as we sometimes see in homes which are not com - fortable. There are two good quotations familiar to all of us, but which if followed are helpful toward making a home comfortable. One of the quotations is 'have a place for everything and everything in its place.' It would make an interesting study if one could find how much time and the number of moves that would be saved in a day or a week if each article were put back into its own place when one is through with it rather than to have it dropped just anywhere and then latter picked </seg>
            <seg id="p437">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION up and put into its own place. This last plan means that many moves and much time are used which might be saved. "The other quotation is this, 'Plan your work, then work your plan.' We all realize that it is possible to have a home too efficient for comfort and that there' is a happy middle ground which is found by the homemaker in the comfortable home. The following poem describes the overcareful housekeeper; it does not describe the homemaker in a com - fortable home: "Yes, it's just as you say, Neighbor Green, A treasure indeed is my wife, Such another for bustle and work I never have seen in my life. But then, she keeps every one else As busy as birds on the wing, There is never a moment for rest, For she's such a fidgety thing! • "She bakes the best bread in the town, Her pies are a perfect delight, Her puddings a rich golden brown, Her doughnuts and crullers just right. But then when we eat them She tells of the worry and care that they bring, Of all the troublesome toil she endures, Oh, she's such a fidgety thing! "My house is as neat as a pin, You should see how the door handles shine ! And all of these soft cushioned chairs And nicely swept carpets are mine; But then, she frets so at the dust, At a fly, or a paper, or string, Well, I stay out of doors all I can, Oh, she's such a fidgety thing! "Yes, it's just as you say, Neighbor Green, A treasure to me has been given. But sometimes, I almost think I'd be glad To lay up my treasure in heaven. "In your home we find companionship which is love. There is love between the father and mother and between the boys and girls. Where there is love there will be sympathy and understanding and kindliness. </seg>

            <seg id="p440">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Here one also finds the little everyday courtesies which mean much in family life. Each member of the family is learning: how to live in har - mony with others, for selfishness does not have a place in the com - fortable home where there is companionship. Boys and girls come to father and mother and talk over their plans and hopes for the future because of this companionship between the members of the family. A fine compliment for any father is to have his son say, 'My father is more like a pal than like a dad.' "In describing a comfortable home we must not leave out coopera - tion, for the responsibilities of the home are -shared by all. Even the younger children have duties to which they attend without being told each time. To develop a greater feeling of cooperation family affairs are talked over and the opinions of all are considered. "One of the outstanding features of your comfortable home is that of confidence. There is honesty and trust on the part of all. Not the kind of honesty which was in a home where the mother said to a friend, 'I do not know what can be done to teach my boy to be honest. He is so untruthful and all I can say does not seem to do any good.' Just at that moment the boy rushed into the room saying, 'Mother, Mrs. Jones is at the door and wants to see you.' The mother replied, 'You tell her I am sick and can not come to the door.' "A speaker once said one of the things this world needed the most of all was absolute honesty. It would help not only the young people, but all of us if we could take as our motto 'Shoot square.' These two words 'shoot square' do say a great deal and if we lived them what would it mean in our mingling with- others ? "In the home where there is. confidence there will be obedience, which is a valuable asset toward making the home comfortable. Think what it would mean if you and I were old enough, no, I do not mean old enough, but rather what if we had the power to tell ourselves what to do and what not to do and then acted accordingly. What if teachers could say, 'I will not teach your child obedience and self-control. This is your responsibility, parents. Your children are to be prepared for study at school before they are to be admitted.' "A comfortable home would not be a help in a community unless the members of the family had some . community responsibility. The home is the place where public opinion is formulated. This is the place where kind remarks about people will grow into the lives of the mem - bers of the household, thus helping them to become useful citizens. We have heard over and over again 'that the success of tomorrow de - pends upon the characters built in the homes of today 1 and so if the boys and girls are to be prepared to take their share of community </seg>
            <seg id="p441">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION responsibility they need to be growing up in that atmosphere in the home. "Two more important factors to be found in your home are recrea - tion and religion. Without either of these much of the comfort would be lacking. Mother needs time for herself whenever possible; having a hobby such as reading, taking a nap, or some other form of recreation will help her. Then, too, how does dad spend his leisure time 1 Does he have a hobby? Keeping the play spirit in the home is one of the finest anchors that a home can have for the boys arid girls through the critical years. Father and mother will be more Comfortable in their home if they have time for companionship and recreation together. "We have left for our last stone to be built into this idea of a comfortable home that of religion. This we may think of as the crown - ing point of it all or perhaps the better way is to think of it as the foundation of it all| for on this foundation much of the rest of the success of the structure depends. Some one has said 'What a heating plant is to the house, religion is to the home,' and if a home is to be comfortable it needs warmth. . ■ "In our. homes we want spiritual poise as well as mental and physical poise and nothing else will give it to us as a personal religion. We want the boys and girls to have consciences that will be ready to tell them what is right and what is wrong and religion will help them in this way. A religion that directs them in their daily lives will be an anchor for them when they leave your comfortable home and go away from your daily influence. "There are other fine things found in your home, but from the ones which have been given so far we realize that comfortable homes are not accidents — they are achievements. It does not seem as though we are quite fair to girls when they are trained for so many other activi - ties in life if training for homekeeping is omitted. If they are to acquire the ability to have comfortable homes of their own, training in home economics will be found especially valuable. Knowing how to do the home work easily and well adds to the pleasure of doing it. "It would be interesting if we could have a score card similar to the ones used for babies, or for kitchen or -for food habits or for articles at a county fair and you could score your home. So far we have not seen a score card that could easily be used. If such a score card could be planned how would your home score today? What will it be ten years from now or what will it be in the lives of your children or grand - children ? "In closing may I repeat that comfortable homes are not mere accidents, they are achievements, for in them we will find religion as </seg>
            <seg id="p442">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE the foundation, and to this we will add health, cheerfulness, attractive - ness, efficiency, courtesy, confidence, cooperation, companionship, com - munity responsibility and recreation. These combined together will give satisfaction and contentment which mean comfort, physically, mentally and spiritually." THURSDAY, DECEMBER 13, 1928 The Thursday meeting was called to order by Miss Brown. Miss Chloe Baldridge of Lincoln, Director of Rural Education, spoke of "The School and the Community." The normal training class from the high school was present and Miss Baldridge gave them some very good points on their duties and opportunities as rural teachers. She illustrated her speech by a story of a boy and his teacher which had come under her personal supervision. This boy had done such poor work in the town school that his father and mother decided to send him to a rural school. They told the teacher of the task she would have in managing this boy. She did find him a problem, but she managed to keep him busy. She went to his mother and talked the matter over with her frankly, get - ting more of an insight into his character. She went past his house every morning, taking him to school, and home every evening, and he started to take an interest in his school work. The teacher became more and more interested in the boy and his work. Some of the boy's work took first prize at the county fair; he also passed his examina - tions. The State Superintendent received a telegram the following August that the boy had been operated upon for appendicitis and had passed away. Think how much better the parents and teacher felt for having given this boy his chance, nor had this labor been lost. This teacher has been promoted from time to time. Her success or failure was determined by solving this boy's problem. A university instructor said- she was the second best writer of children's stories in the state of Nebraska." Miss Baldridge then discussed the wonderful work of the P. T. A. Dr. Winship says the P. T. A. is "heaven born and nothing less." Dr. Claxton says: "The P. T. A. is the keystone of a vigorous and virtuous democracy." Then Miss Baldridge discussed with the normal training students the possibilities of P. T. A. work in their communities. In these meetings there are three things to keep in view: 1. A short, snappy business meeting. 2. Worth while discussion. 3. The social hour. Miss Baldridge closed by giving several objectives concerning P. T. A. work. Next was community singing, after which Miss Nellie Williams continued her discussion on books, her subject being "A Child's Read - ing" and a round table discussion. As the normal training class was present, she outlined her talk of the day previous, giving the students </seg>
            <seg id="p443">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION a list of the books, as mentioned before. A round table discussion was next held and some of the questions and answers were as follows: Q. What magazines are good for boys and girls in the teens? A. There is a dearth of good current literature for boys and girls of this age. The few good ones include "St. Nicholas," "Popular Me - chanics for Boys," "The American Boy" and "The American Girl," 'The Boy's Life." Q. Will you please explain the Traveling Library? A. These books may be secured on application. If for an indi - vidual they are loaned for a month and if for a community they may be had as long as three months. You pay the postage, which, is very, cheap. The address is The Nebraska Public Library Commission, Lin - coln, Nebr. Q. Can you send at any time during the year? A. Yes, but it is best to get your bid in early as the books are going and coming all of the time. We have sent out books to every county in the state. Q. Do ycu have a list of your books? A. No, as it is almost impossible to get an authentic list because books which are new come in every day. Q. How many books are there in the Library Commission? A. About 34,000 books. Miss Williams then took up a discussion of poetry for children. She said that she felt that poetry for children was being neglected in their education although in recent years there seemed to be more in - terest shown. She read a number of poems and gave a list of poetry books which are available. Miss Bess Steele of Lincoln took Miss Evelyn Metzger's place and demonstrated attractive curtains. She said one should select shades which harmonize with the exterior of the house as well as the interior. Curtains should be thin to soften the light. Draperies which are heavier are used mostly for decorative purposes. In regard to curtain rods, Miss Steele commended rods of the Kirsch variety which are flat, easy to use and inexpensive: They can be purchased for thin curtains alone, one rod is thirty cents, two rods for thin curtain and valance, sixty cents, three rods for thin curtain, valance and. drapery, ninety cents. Eacli red is a different depth, so each curtain hangs freely on its own rod. When all three rods are used, one fastening with three hooks </seg>
            <seg id="p444">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE holds all three. Poles of wood or iron are easy to manage for drapes and the thin curtains can he hung on the flat rod underneath. Poles should not be too ornate if iron, nor too gaudy in color if painted, be - cause the top of the window is not a logical place for accent. Materials for curtains in general are made of voile, fillet net, cheesecloth, dotted swiss or theatrical gauze. Cheesecloth for sash curtains in the bath room and kitchen; dotted swiss or voile in bed rooms; fillet nets or voile or theatrical gauze should be used in living rooms and dining rooms. Drapes in general are made of chintz, ging - ham, rattinet and cretonne. A material light in color and rather thin like pongee, unbleached muslin or gingham may be used alone on win - dows without the thin curtains. This type of curtaining should be used in a room where light is needed. In regard to the color of curtains in different rooms, Miss Steele said that yellow voile curtains in a north room would help to give a warmer, sunnier effect. In general curtains should be cream or ecru because white is too glaringly different from the value of walls and furnishings. White or nearly white looks better in bed rooms where lighter and daintier colors are used for the wall and furnishings. The draperies should be a color contrasting to the walls, although if figured it is safer to choose draperies containing some of the same color as the walls, with figures of contrasting color. For example, with yellow walls, light green draperies which contain yellow, drapes with violet and other colored figures. Draperies should not be very dark against light walls unless the ceiling is beamed, then they seem to help the effect of sup - port. In hanging curtains and draperies, the fixtures should be placed so a little of the framework shows all around because the means of support is then visible. However, if the woodwork is not good or the window too narrow, the fixtures may be placed so the curtains cover it. The valance is used to help the eye carry around the window frame and to shorten the effect of very narrow, tall windows. . The valance should hang from its own rod and extend clear across the window and not hang down like a little apron between the curtains. If the little piece of valance between the drapes is sewed to the drapes so it be - comes a part of them, the whole thing can be hung on one rod with good effect. If the wall paper is figured, the furniture upholstery figured, and the rug figured, the draperies should be plain. If the walls are plain or very indistinctly figured, the draperies should be figured. Usually elaborately figured nets are used only where one does not want to see the view outside. Curtains should hang so the lines of hanging har - monize with the lines of the window. If they come together in the •■ • .I".".'. </seg>
            <seg id="p445">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION center of the top of the window and are pinched tightly back with tie backs, the angles thus formed are conspicuous and unpleasant. Miss Steele had a wonderful exhibition of curtains which was made by the home economics girls at the State University, Lincoln. These, with samples which she brought, aptly illustrated her lecture. In the evening the women joined the others in the Annual Family Fun Feed, in the M. E. Church gymnasium. Mr. Cullen Wright of Scotts - bluff was toastmaster. FRIDAY, DECEMBER 14. 1928 Meeting was called to order by Mrs. C. J. 'Royal, president. Com - munity singing followed. Mrs. Royal named the nominating committee as follows: Mrs. Etta Beal of Alliance, Mrs. McClanahan of Kimball county and Mrs. Bruce of Deuel county. Miss Steele of Lincoln gave a talk on the "Art in Everyday Living," which was in part as follows: "I wonder if you are at a' loss to know what that subject might imply as much as I was when I found I was to substitute for Miss Metzger. It can cover almost anything we may want it to cover. In going over material we decided what was most worth while, that of making the best of what we have might be a very good application of art in everyday living. As we have been housekeeping for a long time we have lived with our house furnishings for a long period of time, and very naturally our ideas about things have changed since we acquired these furnishings, and yet we cannot discard the things we have and refurnish. But there is something we can do to make those things we are dissatisfied with more satisfactory. I would like to talk and bring up a few questions and then have some discussion with you. All of you have problems along this line and you would like to have us answer them for you. Probably the things that we possess have been given to us or handed down, and we are not able to replace them. Or, if we are living in houses that are not our own, there are fixtures about them . that are undesirable and we can not change them, but we can make them more satisfactory. "There are three things that we can accomplish to make the best of the things we have. First, by elimination. When you go home I 'would like to have you look over the things you have in your house and see if there are not many things that you could do without. As the years go on we acquire one thing after another for sentimental reasons more than for any other motive, and then we have our house full of mementoes. They give us a great deal of pleasure, but we are setting </seg>
            <seg id="p446">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE our sense of pleasure ahead of making- a beautiful home. We should create the most beautiful home we can. We should study consequently how to perfect the beauty of everything and by doing so we make the environment of pur home as beautiful as possible. It means we have to sacrifice many of these possessions in the home. . "The harmony of the home is made by early traits formed in the child so we must have this in the home. This atmosphere is hard to define. Harmony in human relationship means agreement — means co - operation — in house furnishings, it means just the same. We can not have false notes and expect to have harmony in our home. Our colors can not be loud and screeching. If our furnishings are quiet, they have the same reaction on the people who are living there. Let us look over our homes from the standpoint of things we could do without — as kodak pictures, portraits, and photographs. Eliminate everything that is not useful and beautiful. The home must have that atmosphere of quiet. We are going to take down several pictures from the wall. We will put up two or three pictures that embody a big idea. Our buffets ac - cumulate a lot of extra things we do not need. A fruit bowl and candle - sticks are all it can accommodate. Also the dresser tops, they accumu - late a lot of stuff. Then we will find that we have too much furniture, but there is some we must eliminate if we have this atmosphere of tran - quility. Vacant spaces are of much more worth than those that are cluttered. We need to have rest spaces to counteract the action spaces. Furniture that is not in good taste must be gotten rid of. If you have gotten rid of everything you possibly can, look over it a second time. "Rearrangement. Do we have our house furnishings arranged to the very best advantage? If we are going to get harmony we have to find and think shape harmony. This is an example of one of the viola - tions we find most frequent in homes today. This room is built on vertical and horizontal lines. If you have a friend who is continually differing with you, you are not getting harmonious relationship. Such is harmonious relationship with shapes of furniture in our homes. Since the lines are vertical and horizontal, the main pieces of furniture must take that position. Are we observing this rule? Are you working on this principle of shape harmony in the arrangement of your furniture? When you put a davenport across the corner you are not playing har - mony with the structure lines. Change the pieces back so they are in harmony with the wall — not flat across the wall, perhaps, but no sharp angle must be made. A daveno in front of the fireplace, either hori - zontal with the fireplace or at right angles to it, is good. Put the piano flat against the wall. Another violation is the use of rugs on the floor. Very often we think we should like that rug better if it is angled on the floor. It shows up better. But do we want it to show up better? </seg>
            <seg id="p447">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION It should not be conspicuous. Another thing we love to angle are our table covers. Use them parallel with the table. Very often in stores you will find this unique placing of things. But it does what they want it to do — draws attention to itself. But we do not want this in our homes. We want an atmosphere of harmony. "Another place where we might well consider shape harmony is in the relation of studying the table we dine upon. Group all of the things that belong to one service where they should be and in harmony with the table. For example, a square table with four rectangular, not round, lunch doilies. We will arrange our plates, tumblers and silver in relationship to our table. Sometimes we just put things on the table and save ourselves time, but if we take a little time and effort we will find ourselves well paid. ■ "In regard to hanging our pictures. If we have to have picture wire showing, we are going to use it in such a way as to create vertical lines. You can readily see that you are creating an angle that is taking away from the picture otherwise. We will not use decorative cords. It might be that a mirror would permit of that kind of treatment. In itself it does not have the interest, a picture has, and therefore could stand a decorative cord. We are going to hang our pictures so that if we have a group of them they will be very orderly and not diagonal across the wall. Have either the top edge or the bottom edge on the level. Hang picutres near the eye level. The ceiling arrangement should be quiet and uninteresting. And now we take up cushions. My, how we love cushions! We are specializing in cushions and lampshades! Let us be very conservative. Every cushion should fulfill a need in the room. The chair may need two, the daveno may need two or three, but no cushion should be so ornate it can not be used. For instance, I made a beautiful cushion and it had a big button in the middle of it. A friend told me she would not want it as it would be too uncomfortable. And take lampshades. We might just as well use our energies for something else than to make lampshades. Keep your lampshades simple and retiring and yet interesting. The ordinary living room should not have more than three lamps. "Concealment. You have things in your home that you can not do away with and yet you can do without." Miss Steele gave methods for concealing these undesirable objects. Slip covers for furniture, wall hangings for overdone, built-in features, were among the things she mentioned. ■ ■ Mrs. Wooters of Broken Bow told of the project work in her com - munity, and what it has meant to other women in her community. Every woman in the neighborhood belongs to the project club and each woman has a responsible part to fill, for enough committees are ap- </seg>
            <seg id="p448">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE HOARD OF AGRICULTURE pointed to keep every member busy and interested. She praised the project work because the lessons are written especially for. farm women. She explained the methods used by their clubs for keeping up the in - terest. One meeting- was held each month for study and one for social meeting. Mrs. Wodters is such an enthusiastic club woman her talk was a source of pleasure and interest to all. Every one who heard this talk felt that it had repaid her to attend the meeting, if only to hear Mrs. Wooters. The nominating committee reported Mrs. Royal of Crawford, presi - dent; Mrs. Bruss of Chappell, vice-president; Mrs. Gaines, or whoever is the county chairman of the project work next fall in Scotts Bluff county, as secretary. It was moved and seconded that the nominations be accepted and voted upon. Carried. Mrs. Eva Morse -of Omaha spoke upon the subject "What Should We Discuss About Sex?" Mrs. Morse said in part as follows: "I am to speak to you of what we shall tell our children about sex. To people who have not considered this, it is a difficult subject to con - sider and to listen to. You women and your children are much better adjusted to this subject than most women to whom I speak. Your children are better adjusted because they come in such splendid contact with this subject of reproduction at home and in their daily life. But in many cases where we would accept the subject of reproduction in lower animals as a matter of course, we are wary of talking about it among human beings. . I hope that is not the case with you, as you have such a splendid opportunity to tell them of human reproduction because of their understanding of reproduction among the lower ani - mals. When I was small I remember neighbor women coming in and whispering something to mother or they would send me out of the room while she told mother something. I thought it was a great mystery, but when I got older, all they said was that some woman was expecting a baby. I shall never forget the time when a young mother came over to see my mother once and she was terribly excited over an awful thing that happened. She was so excited that she forgot to whisper it softly. She said her little boy was ruined for life, as he came into the room where she was dressing and he saw the hair under her arms. When we came to look at these matters in a commonplace way, we can see that a child of six or seven ought to know these things. "The mother should see that the physical facts are known by the time the child is ten years old, because if he is told before that time, we have helped him get the facts before he has any special feeling on the subject at all. It does not concern him at all. We took up the matter extensively of what we should tell the boys and girls. One "man </seg>
            <seg id="p449">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION said that his little boy asked him about the sex act, and he told the little ! boy. In the next breath he had started on another subject. If we talk to them before they have reached the age of adolescence, they have no feeling on the subject. ■ "The sex story. I want you to keep in mind the physical part is the smallest part of it, and it is your attitude toward it that gets the story over. Anybody who- grits his teeth can tell the physical part of it. Can you tell your child in such a way that when he goes out with a girl he has the right attitude? No one should tell it who can not tell it easily. To a very little child you can make it very easy. If you have once said it out loud, you can tell it to the child. Some people i say that the schools ought to teach this; but if the- parents will not tell it, then the schools should, but the parents should tell it by all means. And if you wait too long, you will find the child has learned a whole lot before that time. Tell the little. child that there has been an egg put into the mother, where no harm can come to it, as it is very tender and must be protected. The father has put this little egg into mother. The reason the father does not have the little egg inside of him is because, although his and mother's organs are the same, mother's is inside of her, and father's is outside of him, and the little egg must be protected. So inside of mother, the little egg grows and grows and grows until it is a life-sized baby, and then it comes out of mother, near the place where mother urinates. "If your child has not asked you about the sex act, there is some - thing wrong with him; he has probably been told by other children and in a much worse way. So it is up to you to tell your child the story of sex." Miss Brown then asked what we had gained from the meetings that would be good to take home. General discussion followed. A motion :for adjournment was made and carried. (14) </seg>

            <seg id="p459">PROCEEDINGS OF THE Nebraska State Horticultural Society TUESDAY AFTERNOON SESSION January 8, 1929 The sixtieth annual convention of the Nebraska Horticultural So - ciety met in Room 106 of the Plant Industry Building of the Agricultural .College, Lincoln, Nebraska, on Tuesday afternoon, January Bth, 1929, and was called to order at one-thirty o'clock by the president, Mr. Guy Shubert, of Shubert, Nebraska. THE PRESIDENT: The first subject is "Possibilities in Vegetable Growing in Western Nebraska," by H. A. McComb, of North Platte, Nebraska. POSSIBILITIES IN VEGETABLE GROWING IN WESTERN NEBRASKA MR. H. A. McCOMB, North Platte, Nebraska Western Nebraska is proud of the crops that are grown, there. We have good soils, ranging from the light sandy loam to the heavier types. We have an abundance of irrigation in many sections, and well de - veloped dry land practices established. It is not strange then that inquiry is made so frequently in regard to the possibilities of vegetable growing. The gardens at the North Platte Substation have shown the possi - bilities of growing immense crops of a number of kinds of vegetables. If we look in the home garden, or that of the local gardener, we also find large yields of a good quality of vegetables. Western Nebraska has been showing vegetables at the State Fair, and has demonstrated its ability to win in competition with the rest of the state. Before entering into a discussion of some of the various crops that produce well, and may have possibilities for future development, I wish (MO </seg>
            <seg id="p460">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE to call attention briefly to some of the opportunities we are passing up. A lot of our farmers are specialists, and have not found time to grow an adequate garden for home use. The first plea from our station is for the development of the home lot, with its windbreaks, ornamentals, home fruit, and home garden. These things are necessary in the de - velopment of the permanent home and while we believe they are profit - able in dollars and cents, they have a greater value in making the home a real home where the comforts of life may be enjoyed by the entire family amid pleasant surroundings. Our first and greatest opportunity is in the development of the home grounds and the garden which more than pays its way. The second opportunity often neglected by our local gardeners is the production of enough garden products to supply our local trade. Every year we find the shelves of dealers loaded with produce from the Denver or other markets, even during the time our crops are prime. This condition will not long exist, -for our gardeners are beginning to think more seriously. They are beginning to specialize. The main reason our markets have not had sufficient supply was that much of the gardening was simply a side line. A number of gardeners are now devoting their whole time to the business and are finding addi - tional markets in the towns near by. When we more nearly supply our own needs we will be in a better position to look for larger markets. A prospective buyer could not be very much impressed with the statement "We can grow them, but don't." Among the possibilities for the development of vegetable growing, are the growing of fresh vegetables for the local market, for the canning or pickle factories, and for the production of the cured crop for table or seed purposes. The ability to produce large crops of. good quality produce is of prime importance. The fact that a community, can produce should be pretty well established before an effort is made to establish a market. It is not easy to find the market, for already the market is pretty well supplied, and the established - gardeners from other places would be pretty well pleased if we did not enter into competition. Our market has to be developed and that is a long, slow process. We have one advantage that we may capitalize. Our quality is good, and sooner or later the trade recognizes quality, especially if delivered in attractive packages. We are familiar with the certified seed potatoes produced in north - western Nebraska and sold in the southern states. Establishing this market was a slow job and to maintain it requires the best quality product all the time. When the growers have developed the production of seed potatoes sufficiently to take on a: new market, it is logical for them to look to eastern Nebraska for a market. While the Triumph is </seg>

            <seg id="p462">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Onions yield well and may be grown profitably up to the demands of the market. Seed onions mature well and reach good sizes for the market. Our growers are beginning to grow the Burmuda onion. It does well and will undoubtedly find a place in the local markets, but it is doubtful if we can compete with the Texas onion on the larger markets. We produce some very good cantaloupes and watermelons. A few varieties would have .shipping possibilities if there was a market, but Colorado has specialized on these crops and is able to place the first on the market. That leaves us the problem of starting a crop on the market at a time a competitor has the market already full. Our season is too short to hope for much sale following the Colorado crop. Our only hope of success in this line is to specialize in something a little different and to build up a market for that product. I have in mind two possibilities. The first is the winter watermelon. It is a melon that does well under irrigation, and runs to uniform quality each year. I have grown this melon for years and find that it is not well known to the trade, but that after having introduced it to the trade that the buyers come back for more. It ships well and keeps longer than any other variety. My observations on the Honey Dew melon between Bridgeport and Broadwater indicate a possibility of growing that variety for the market on some of the lighter soils under irrigation. We are already growing the cucumber for the pickle factories. The harvesting of the crop comes at a time when work in the beet fields is slack. Therefore, it is easy to get picking help. We can grow any of these vine crops for seed purposes if at any time we are able to get suit - able contracts with the seed companies. Leaf Crops: Cabbage is easily grown. We can easily produce the quality necessary for the market, but the market is already well sup - plied and we can hope for no large demand until we are better organized for the selling. We have had some good success in growing head lettuce at North Platte. Several growers have attempted it with fair success. I believe it is possible to find varieties and develop methods so that we may pro - duce head lettuce at least sufficient for our needs, and possibly for the market. I have had good results with the Iceberg and the Wonderful. I would offer the following suggestions for growing head lettuce: Use only transplanted plants, started in the hot' bed for the early crop, and cold frame for later plantings. Water light during the early growth of the plant to induce good root development, and heavier to force the </seg>
            <seg id="p463">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY head. It is possible that partial shade will be found necessary for mid - summer crops. I know I can grow it and others can also. I had two double rows across my garden this last year and had more than we could use. We sent three dozen to .one of the stores and you should have -, seen the trouble we had turning away the trade; the store wanted more and we told them we didn't have it, and they kept sending their customers there to get these individual heads. These people said it was the best quality of head lettuce they had ever seen. I know of a number of patches of head lettuce which did fairly well, their stock was not as good as mine, but I feel they made the mistake of too heavy and too early watering. Personally I have grown a good many thousands of heads, both in the greenhouse and outside, and I have come to the very definite conclusion that it is a mistake to give it too heavy early water - ing. I think it can be developed so that we can take care of our home trade. ' We find a large number of small celery patches, and occasionally a larger one. Among these we find some excellent celery produced. I cannot say as to the expense of growing, but it seems very likely we may produce at least enough to supply our home market. Sweet Corn: The Golden Bantam corn yields well and has an ex - cellent flavor. It could be grown in quantities for canning, or as a seed crop, if at any time market conditions would warrant. The Jap rice pop-corn does well on dry land. The quality is good. We undoubtedly could find a market for much more of this crop than we now grow. Beans are a crop that yield remarkably well. We are now growing the pinto and the large navy and Martha Washington for the market. Many varieties of the snap bean yield well, and may be produced for a -seed crop at any time a satisfactory market is arranged. For growing the snap bean we have a long'growing season, so this crop can be made available for canning or for shipments to nearby markets. Tomatoes, peppers, egg plants, cauliflower, squash, pumpkin, peas and numerous other vegetables are grown successfully. These find a place in the local markets. Some of them may be developed so that they will take a larger place in the markets. Western Nebraska has possibilities in vegetable growing that may and probably will be developed in the future. We are at present in the very early stages of that development. </seg>
            <seg id="p464">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Before we may h.-pe for much success -we shall have to learn what varieties are the most productive and at the same time satisfy the demands of the customer. If we make a place for our products on the market, a. quality vegetable, either in a manufactured state or green, is the product we must offer. While the canning industry seems to be adequate to supply the demands of the trade, I do not believe we will hesitate to take advantage of the openings as they present themselves. As the demand for our products increase there will be developed dis - tributing agencies, capable of supplying the trade. Potentially, western Nebraska is an undeveloped garden spot, that has the capacity to develop as fast as the demands of the trade per - mit, but at present our big problem is the development of the farm home, the local garden, and in doing so, learn more definitely as to varieties best suited and as to cultural methods. We are not ready now to reach out for any large amount of the market, and should not make the mistake of launching an industry until we know the outlet for the crop, and have a reasonable chance for success. PRESIDENT SHUBERT: Are there any questions you wish to ask Mr. McComb? MR. J. R. DAVIDSON: I would like to ask if you have tried the paper mulch? MR. McCOMB: I have not. MR. J. R. DAVIDSON: How do you keep the lice off of the cucum - bers? MR. McCOMB: I use the nicotine-sulfate dust. MR. J. R. DAVIDSON: That is the same as Black Leaf 40? MR. McCOMB: "Black Leaf 40" is the trade name used by one company for nicotine sulfate dust. You can get a circular from the Extension Service telling how to mix this with hydrated lime to make the nicotine dust. MR. J. R. DAVIDSON: My desire is to raise as many as I want to eat, but I can't do it. MR. McCOMB: You might do better by a rotation of crops. MR. OSCAR FOALT: Do you know anything for the big squash ■bug? MR. McCOMB: I know of nothing except to spray them with about the strongest per cent I can get. Mr. Werner told me one time about </seg>
            <seg id="p465">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY spraying them with Bordeaux; it is the spray I use myself. I buy it from the Rocky Ford farm. MR. OSCAR FOALT: That is negative? MR. McCOMB: Yes, it will kill the young bugs, but it won't the. old ones. Where you have plenty of room I think the best solution is to rotate the crop, then you have a very small item in picking the bugs. I know I produce good squash and pumpkins where I ordinarily grow them. MR. PRESIDENT: The next on our program is ".The Modern Trend in Vegetable Production," by Prof. .J. T. Quinn, of Columbia, Missouri. THE MODERN TREND OF VEGETABLE PRODUCTION J. T. QUINN, • Missouri College of Agriculture Mr. President and Gentlemen: On appearing before an audience like this one usually attempts to say something about being glad to be here. I am going to say that I feel honored to be asked to appear on your program for this reason, that most of you are &lt; looking at me now and thinking, "That is a specimen from Missouri," but you are going to have to blame Lancaster county, Nebraska, for I spent the first twelve yeaf s of my life in the city here, although you wouldn't have known it if you had seen me looking for a car this morning trying to find a way to get out here. I have prepared a paper and I tried to prepare it and follow the subject given me. In any place where I refer to a recommendation it does not refer to Nebraska. If you want to know how to grow anything in Nebraska, see Professor Werner. If western Nebraska has started growing vegetables and is growing them as successfully as we have heard here, I am afraid Professor Erwin in Iowa, and other places, will have to get busy. The aggregate value of vegetable products of the United States amounts approximately to one billion dollars annually. This figure is of course an estimate, for it is difficult to place an exact value upon the product of an industry so diversified and divided into so many types of production. • . The area of land devoted to the production of these crops amounts to less than 2 per cent of the total crop land, while their value is nearly 9 per cent of the value of all farm crops. When we consider these values and the fact that some of the best soil in the United States is devoted to vegetable production we cannot help but come to the con- </seg>
            <seg id="p466">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE elusion that the growing of vegetables is a very important phase of American agriculture. Vegetable growing, like many other types of agriculture, has had its depressions, which in the main have been due to over production, and adverse weather conditions, for various crops in different sections. Being a perishable product, and in many instances a short season crop, fluctuation in acreage is more common and over or under production tends to be more numerous than with some of our more stable crops as corn or wheat. The demand for vegetables has greatly increased within the last few years. This is due to a number of reasons, the more important being the growth of our cities and industrial centers, together with a greater demand in the smaller town markets throughout the country. The great amount of research work that is being done from the nutri - tional standpoint emphasizing the value of vegetables as a food and the wide distribution of this information in newspapers, farm journals, various magazines and agricultural experiment station bulletins has been directly responsible for a good portion of this increase. I doubt if there is a school child in the country in the fourth grade or above that who cannot tell one of the importance of vegetables as a food. Many of you may feel that this newer information regarding the value of vegetables from the nutritional standpoint has not been re - sponsible for any great increase in their consumption. It is only neces - sary for us to refer to just a few crops with which a great amount of research work has been conducted. Spinach perhaps leads the list, in that relatively only a few years ago it was considered a minor crop. Today it is one of the important vegetable crops, both for fresh use and for canning. Old production areas are showing increases in acreage while new production areas are coming into prominence. The farm garden has also shown an increase in the amount of spinach being planted. The same is true, but to a less extent, with asparagus and carrots. Tomatoes, lettuce,* and rhubarb have also profited from the wide publicity given their nutritional values. It might be well for us to consider some of the conditions responsible for the geographical distribution of the vegetable industry of this country. Climate, soil types, transportation facilities, with other eco - nomic factors, have played an important part. The climatic conditions which have such an 'influence on crop pro - duction are temperature, rainfall, humidity and sunlight. All these factors tend to make certain sections of the United States especially desirable for the production of a' given vegetable. A very broad ex - ample would be the sweet potato', which is as you know, grown to the </seg>
            <seg id="p467">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY greatest extent in the southern states. This is not due to the fact that the sweet potato was possibly preferred in the southern states, but because the general climatic conditions such as temperature, humidity and length • of day were exceptionally well adapted to its production. On the other hand, we have just the reverse in the Irish potato in the northern states where conditions, although much different than those most desirable for sweet potatoes, are especially desirable for cool season crops. More specific examples regarding climatic conditions would be the trucking sections of southern California, the muskmelon districts of Colorado, and the Bermuda onion districts of Texas. In the muskmelon sections of the west and southwest, the dry atmospheric conditions so well suited to the proper ripening of the mature fruit makes a' good comparison with our southeastern Missouri contaloupe section, where quite often excessive amounts of moisture at the ripening season retards its maturity and tends to cause losses from diseases. Soil has been a very important factor in the location of many of our trucking sections. Although unlike climate it is possible, at least to a considerable extent, to change the general character of the soil. We have the muck soil of some of the northern states which are especially suited to some crops, while the sandy and medium sandy loam soils are ideally adapted for other crops. Although most soils used for intensive vegetable growing 1 are soils high in fertility, never - theless, many of our canning: crops are produced on soils which are in some instances too poor to produce profitable field crops. This is true of some of the soils of our Ozark tomato section. More efficient transportation facilities are being 1 utilized to the fullest extent in vegetable production. The paved highways of the eastern states have been used for years, while the newer road systems in our central states are proving of great advantage. Railroad service from special districts cooperate to the extent that vegetables hundreds of miles away reach their destination in the same fresh condition as those from the nearby market garden. In our own state we have a very good example of this service. In the southern section where grow - ers are specializing in such crops as spinach and radishes, we find them leaving this section at night and arriving at St. Louis the next morning. Let us now see what the present trend is in some of the different types or kinds of vegetable production. I shall refer to home garden - ing, vegetable forcing, market gardening, truck gardening, seed grow - ing, and the production of canning: and pickling crops. The last census of the United States Department of Agriculture shows that : approxi - mately 78 per cent of the farms of the United States had farm gardens. It is true that the farm garden is an asset to any farm. Nevertheless the tendency is toward the purchase of many vegetables which were at </seg>
            <seg id="p468">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE one time produced in the small gardens and canned or stored for winter use. Potatoes, cabbage and onions are good examples for the stored product, with tomatoes, green beans, beets and sweet potatoes being purchased in the cans. Many general farmers believe that it is more economical to spend their time on their major farm crop and buy at least the major vegetables which are placed in storage. In some in - stances, especially in the central and southern states, some crops usually produced under ideal conditions in the northern states are of a higher quality and keep better in storage than the home grown product. i . . . . The city or small town garden which just a few years ago occupied most of the space in the rear of the lot, is now being planted to shrubs and flowers. This condition has been true for some time in the resident parts of our larger cities. But it is only within the past few years that this change has been so very noticeable in our smaller cities and towns. This change is being fostered by many civic organizations and women's garden clubs throughout the United States. In the past we have been in the habit of saying that if the vegetables were not pro - duced in the garden the family would do without them, but such is not the: case. At least the steady increase in the consumption of vegetables of the smaller cities and larger towns do not indicate such. This demand is not only for the common vegetables, but such crops as head lettuce and celery are now had two or three times a week where they used to be a Sunday occurrence. The vegetable forcing industry, wherein large quantities of vegeta - bles are forced out of season, is feeling the effects of the more modern and highly efficient methods of transportation. Crops which at one time were being produced profitably under glass are now meeting strong competition from the same product shipped from some section producing them outside at the same season that they are being produced in other sections under glass. Lettuce is perhaps the outstanding example of this condition. A few years' ago central and middle eastern states were finding little trouble in marketing their greenhouse leaf lettuce. Today the head lettuce from the western coast is fast replacing the leaf lettuce in most of our homes and greenhouse men are giving their attention to other crops and looking for substitutes. Further competition is being felt from the importation of such crops as tomatoes from Old Mexico and some other countries. Where the market pays a premium for quality, the greenhouse tomato, and cucumber is meeting with but little competition from the poorer quality of the green wrapped tomatoes shipped during the winter months. A phase of the forcing industry which is seemingly quite promising at the present is the forcing of mushroom, rhubarb and asparagus. We have a number of sections in Missouri where the growing of mushrooms is flourishing. </seg>
            <seg id="p469">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Market gardening, the type of vegetable production which we find around our cities and centers of population, has changed considerably within the last few years. The distance of market gardens from the city has been greatly increased by the building of good roads. Where a few years ago twelve miles was quite a distance for a truck garden, it is not uncommon to find them forty or fifty miles away on a good highway. This is tending to make a truck gardener or truck farmer out of the market gardener. The market gardener is growing fewer vegetables, but he is growing them in larger quantities today than he did a few years ago when he was closer to market and on higher priced land. This condition is taking place about our St. Louis market in Missouri. The city has been growing rapidly and new divisions have been absorbing land that was formerly used for market gardens. Many of these market gardeners have moved out and are now really truck gardeners or truck farmers. Market gardeners who at one time had little trouble disposing of their many different crops are now meeting .real competition and feeling the effects of crops shipped in from dis - tricts where they are grown on a truck crop basis. A few years ago in the St. Louis section bunched radishes and carrots were among the common crops grown by the market gardener. They have of late found it almost impossible to compete with the truck gardeners in the south - eastern part of the state where the same vegetables are grown in fields of from ten to fifty acres each, and placing a high quality and graded product on the St. Louis market the next morning after harvesting. The more modern methods of transportation have increased the possi - bilities of truck farming, in that a few vegetables can be grown a con - siderable distance from market on land that is low in price and where facilities for expansion are not limited. Again we find specialization being the trend and finding truck farming expanding and in many cases at the expense of market gardening. Another very important branch of the vegetable industry and one that is going forward at a very rapid pace is seed growing. This in - dustry has been developed more extensively on the western coast. Seed growing is perhaps one of the most specialized phases of the vegetable industry. This is mainly due to the demand of the average grower for high quality seed, and because of his further willingness to pay for quality, the seed industry is in a fairly stable condition. No other phase of vegetable growing is perhaps on a sounder scientific basis and many of our larger producers and vegetable seed companies are individual experiment stations in themselves. The production of canning and pickling crops has shown the greatest increase of any of the types of vegetable production. This is especially true of tomatoes, sweet corn, peas, asparagus, spinach, beans, and others. According to the United States census report of 1925 there </seg>
            <seg id="p470">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE were 94,580,742 standard cases of vegetables packed, as compared with 25,375,000 standard cases of fruit. The canning industry is widely distributed with the different states leading in the crops for which their climate and weather conditions are ideally adapted. A few years ago there was a considerable slump in many canning sections. This was true in the tomato canning sections in southwest Missouri, where around twenty thousand acres are grown annually. At present the trend in most of the canning sections is not in increased acreage, but toward an increased yield per acre of a first-class product and the production of a high quality pack. There is a decided move toward the elimination in some sections of the many small, unsanitary and ill equipped canneries. The tendency is to replace the many small canneries by fewer larger modern factories drawing from a wider area' and in a position to obtain government inspection, both as to quality and grade of the canned product and to the grading of the raw material as it comes to the cannery. There are a few instances in our central states where a' can - nery has tried to operate upon a surplus of crops grown primarily for market. Where this has been tried it has met with almost complete failure and further demonstrates the fact that if crops are to be grown for the cannery they must be grown with that purpose in mind, for this is the only basis upon which the cannery can successfully operate and produce a quality product Through all the different types of vegetable production there is a decided tendency toward specialization, this specialization extending from the large truck fanning sections of the west to the gradual evolution of the market gardener into a truck farmer. Now, for a discussion of some specific practices. I shall begin with plant growing, which is so important since many of our important vegetable crops are started in their seed bed and later transplanted to field. The central states are gradually following the practices of some of our eastern sections. The passing of the manure' heated hot-bed in many of the eastern sections started some years ago. Today in our central states this type of structure is rapidly being replaced by small forcing structures which are using- hot air, water or steam as a source of heat. A combination of the old flue plant bed of the South with moveable sash is being used. The pit plant house making use of the standard hot bed sash with a small hot water heating plant is probably one of the best inexpensive types in use today. The more elaborate plant houses or small greenhouses are becoming more numerous in some of our larger vegetable centers. It has been demonstrated that the added efficiency in handling plants in these more modern, per - manent structures, and the quality of the plants produced, more than offset the added cost of construction. The methods of handling plants within these structures are showing a decided change. A few years ago transplanting from' flats was considered a step forward, then the paper </seg>
            <seg id="p471">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY pots and bands, today the grower that is taking advantage of every possible help to produce strong, vigorous early plants is using to a considerable extent the wood veneer band or the standard 3 or 4 inch clay pot. The cost, of the clay pot is not prohibitive, especially where purchased in carload lots. The growers of- early tomatoes around St. Joseph have found the clay pot a very good type of container. Where earliness is a factor the modern type of containers are being used. The veneer band is being used' more of late, especially with some of the vine crops. In southern Illinois and southeast Missouri the veneer band is especially popular with the muskmelon growers, enabling them to get their product on the market ahead of the regular crop. It is be - coming a common practice to transplant many vegetables which in the past have been sown directly in the field. This practice is especially popular with market gardeners around many of our small markets. For the canning crops — where extreme earliness is not important — the trend is toward more care and attention to plant growing. The eastern tomato canning sections have recognized this fact and are ahead of some of our central states canning sections. . Specialization in the grow - ing of plants is becoming quite common. Cooperation in the form of community plant beds, wherein plants of a. definite strain or variety are produced for a whole community. These practices are doing much toward maintaining high producing strains which have proven especially adapted to a given section. The demand of some of the central and northern states for plants of certain vegetables which could be produced more cheaply in the open field in the southern states that under forcing conditions in the north - ern states have been largely responsible for the thriving wholesale plant industry in some of our southern states. Millions of plants of such vegetables as Bermuda onion, cabbage, tomato, cauliflower, pepper and eggplants are annually shipped to northern sections. At the start of this industry a few years ago, results obtained from southern grown plants were not the best. However, with a stricter supervision by the State Plant and Quarantine Boards and better methods of growing, handling, and packing, the tendency has been to produce a first-class, disease-free product which is finding a ready market. Missouri has been using millions of both cabbage and Bermuda plants. Another item so essential in the successful production of vegetables is good seed. Most of us have heard our grandfathers elaborate upon the necessity for good seed corn and the great care which was exercised in its selection. £uch a practice is just as important, if not more so, today; but it has seemingly been a difficult task to educate some grow - ers in' the use of high quality vegetable seed. Since the cost of seed is such a small part of the total cost of production of moat vegetables, the very best seed obtainable is none too good. The growers of cannery </seg>
            <seg id="p472">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE crops in many sections were among the last to discontinue the use of poor seed. In many tomato canning sections the seed planted was from the average run of tomatoes for the catsup factory. Although the tomatoes may have been excellent for the purpose for which intended, they were certainly a poor source of seed. In some Instances both pink and red tomatoes were found in the same field. This condition has greatly improved in the last few years. There is less of the $1.00 a pound tomato seed being used, for it has been conclusively demon - strated that high yields of quality fruit cannot be obtained from inferior seed. This condition is also true with most other vegetables, and a few seedsmen whose main' object was "volume of sales" are finding old customers buying their seed elsewhere and new customers becoming fewer in number.- The best seed is the cheapest at the average price asked by reputable seedsmen. Most seedsmen realize the importance of high quality seed, which is indicated by a tendency toward increased specialization in that fewer varieties are offered and in many cases only strains of a few varieties, but in all instances putting quality above all. The question of varieties is as old as vegetable gardening itself. It was one of the problems of agricultural experiment stations twenty - five years ago, and is today one of the very important problems in the vegetable industry. In the early trials or experiments with vegetables, it was assumed that the information obtained in one state for a given variety might have a much broader application than it was found to have. Varieties which were suited to Indiana conditions were found in many instances unsuited to other states. At that time varieties were often classed in a very broad manner. This was especially true of seed catalogue descriptions. Early large, and red might have been a description for the Earliana tomato. Little thought was often given as to its shipping or canning qualities, to say nothing of the possibility of strains within a variety. Today variety is a general, term with many vegetables, the strain of the variety being the practical basis upon which many vegetables are classified. I should .again like to refer to the tomato as an. example. In many sections the Earliana tomato is the principal early variety. In Missouri on most of our heavier fertile soils we seem unable to find a strain of Earliana adapted to our con - ditions. In the Ozark canning sections, the Greater Baltimore and Marglobe are being used. Here again the strain has indicated its im - portance. Some Greater Baltimores carried a' high percentage of "cat - faces" or roughened' blossoni ends; this condition tended to produce an inferior pack since it was necessary for the peelers to remove this roughened portion, and in so doing the seed cavities were punctured, which of course affected the appearance of the pack. In this same - canning section are strains of this same variety with smooth bloom ends. Most of these better strains have been preserved by the growers. </seg>
            <seg id="p473">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY themselves, through careful selection and the saving of their own seed. This same principle holds true with some other vegetables and is re - sponsible for the increase in the number of growers who are saving their own seed in order to maintain their particular strain. The use of such seed- of a known strain is doing much .toward increasing yields and improving the market quality in many of our important vegetable sections. The widespread use of disease-resistant strains of certain vegetables which are now available from many experiment stations and seed houses is further evidence of the trend of the general public to make use of the newer methods and information to be had. In line with this variety and strain specialization, seedsmen are making every effort to cooperate with the grower. At present there are seedsmen specializing in certain vegetables whose reputation and business success depend upon their ability to maintain the strain for which he has become known. The problem of soil fertility has always been one of the most im - portant factors in vegetable production. Barnyard manure has been and still is one of the principal fertilizing materials used in many com - mercial gardening districts. However, the increase in acreage together with the decrease in the amount of manure available has been responsi - ble for the steady increase in the use of commercial fertilizers among the market gardeners and truck farmers. In many market gardening sections, barnyard manure is being used in combination with commercial fertilizers. In this manner sufficient manure is used to maintain the humus content of the soil with the food requirements of the plant being taken care of through commercial fertilizers. The truck farmer on his lower priced land is in most instances using green manures supple - mented with commercial fertilizers. The southern and eastern states are, of course, the heaviest users of commercial fertilizers. The central states are showing a steady increase in the amount being used. In the market garden sections this increase, as stated before, is brought about primarily .through the scarcity of manure. In many truck farm - ing sections and for cannery crop production this is not the reason, for here large amounts of commercial fertilizers are being used upon land that has had little or no barnyard manure applied. Under Missouri conditions where the use of commercial fertilizers is on the increase, especially on such crops as early tomatoes, potatoes, and early cabbage, the increase has been due primarily to a better understanding of the plant food value of fertilizers, and the demonstrated facts that there are benefits to be derived other than just increases in yield. Such facts as increased earliness, higher quality and' increased vigor has made commercial fertilizer a necessity in many of our more important vegeta - ble centers. </seg>
            <seg id="p474">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE In general cultural practices, the tendency is to reduce the amount of hand labor to a minimum and use wherever possible the many labor saving machines now on the market. The newer type machines for the washing, bunching, and tying of market, garden crops and the more common use of seeders, transplanters, fertilizer drills and more efficient spraying equipment is doing much toward lowering the cost of pro - duction and at the same time taking some of the old time drudgery out of vegetable growing. The adoption of newer cultural practices, which experiments and research have shown to be the better method, is in many instances doing much to raise the quality of the products and lower production costs. The methods of applying commercial fertilizer is a very good example. A few years ago so many pounds of fertilizer was broadcast per acre and forgotten about — now we find the grower using the recommended fertilizer for the particular crop, applying it to meet the plant's re - quirements. Such fertilizer may be broadcast, applied in the hill or row, and in many instances making numerous applications throughout the growing season. In the watermelon sections, we find the practice of thinning producing more and better melons per acre. The common use of such practices as training, pruning and thinning are further examples of the more modern methods. There was a time when commercial vegetable growers had many "pet" methods that were in many instances founded on superstitions. This type of grower is almost a' novelty, for in his place we have a highly trained individual dealing in one of the most intensive branches of agriculture and willing at all times to cooperate for his own good and for the advancement of his fellow growers. It is a fact that al - though there is already much known regarding cultural practices, which is not being used, it is a further fact that our growers in the commercial vegetable sections are ready at all times to give practices recommended by our agricultural colleges a thorough trial.- In some instances it has been necessary for the institutions to recommend caution in the ap - plication of results of research which needed further field experiment - ing before giving it to the growers in the form of a recommendation. The ever present problem of insect and disease control is more of a problem in some of the less important vegetable communities than sections where vegetable production is the principal agricultural enter - prise. In these sections the growers have a fair knowledge of the life history of diseases and insects and a' very good understanding of the types of insecticides and fungicides to use in combating the pests. The use of disease-resistant varieties, and thorough and timely use of in - secticides and fungicides tends to reduce losses from the more common pestr found in commercial sections. </seg>
            <seg id="p475">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY In the discussion of plant growing, I mentioned the effect of the good work of the Plant Boards in some of our southern states. Many northern central states have such Plant Boards that are doing much in the way of reducing losses from both diseases and insects through their inspection and certification services. The agricultural experiment stations have shown the value of certified seed and plants, and growers have come to demand the same from their dealers. The Irish potato seed certification of Nebraska is a very good example. A few years ago it was almost impossible to grow a profitable crop of Triumph potatoes in Missouri, due to mosaic and other virus diseases. Today these certified Triumphs can be grown with but little or no trace of these diseases. The elimination • of stem rot in sweet potatoes through state certification is well recognized by growers and such certified stocks or plants are being used. Specialization on a lew crops in any given area tends to standardize control methods. In such sections the most modern methods are stand - ard practices. So far I have discussed conditions and cultural practices as they effect production. These are all very necessary and essential, but profits in commercial vegetable growing depend to a considerable extent upon proper handling and marketing. Many growers are very efficient producers, but fail completely when- marketing their product. These marketing failures have been to a considerable extent responsible for the increase in marketing associations. It is true that there have been failures among such cooperatives, but there are at present many grow - ers' cooperatives, both in the small -and large markets, that are doing much toward taking the worry out of the marketing problem for the grower. In some sections these associations have been responsible for higher price levels than might have existed had the grower been re - quired to deal with the independent market. These associations have further been responsible for and a great aid in furthering the work of the grading and marketing programs of the U. S. Department of Agriculture and our agricultural colleges. Perhaps in no other field of crop production is it as necessary for the grower to know his market demands. These demands vary for different markets and in different areas. I should like to refer to just a few examples. The general- demand for sweet potatoes on the '■ Chicago market is for the Jersey type potato. This preference is not only noticeable in the demand, but in the general price paid for the Jersey potato over the Nancy Hall. On the St. Louis market the Nancy Hall is the principal potato, where it is considered the standard of per - fection. The red varieties are very much in demand on this market, while the Kansas City demand for the red type sweet potato is very </seg>

            <seg id="p477"/>
            <seg id="p478">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE light. Again, referring to the tomato, the St. Louis market demands the "blue" or "pink" for the first early crop, later the red tomato is preferred. This is not true on the Kansas City and St. Joseph market where the general demand is for the red tomato. I could name many more examples of market demands such as the preference for a solid red radish over the white tipped and the present demand for green asparagus over the once popular blanched tips. These facts are known in our commercial sections, but one may still find market gardeners about some of our smaller markets devoting time, energy and space to the production of unwanted vegetable crops. Some of the best overlooked markets today are in small cities and large towns. ■•■■'•■ . ■ ' • '■■■'■' One might spend hours discussing the necessity for proper grading, preparation for market and types of containers. Competition in the modern market demands that all vegetables be graded. The United States Department of Agriculture has suggested grades for most of our vegetable crops and in many states these or similar grades have been adopted and are in general use. Marketing low quality and poorly graded vegetables in the modern market is a practice of the past. The American public expects quality in vegetables as well as in other com - modities and are willing to pay the price. In conclusion — it is safe to say vegetable production is on an up - ward trend. Specialization in all branches of the industry, the use of the most modern practices in production and marketing and the ap - plication of modern business methods have placed it upon as stable a foundation as any other branch of agriculture. It is true that there is much room for improvement which will come through the general adoption of the most modern methods. These methods will naturally change from time to time as the results of scientific research are made available to the industry. In closing I should like to extend greetings from Professor Talbert, Missouri State Horticulturist, and Patterson Bain, secretary of the Missouri State Horticultural Society. I have further been asked to extend to all of you a cordial invitation to attend the Seventieth An - niversary Meeting of the Missouri State Horticultural Society, which will be held in the Missouri Hotel, Jefferson City, Missouri, January 30-31. </seg>

ERWIN, Iowa State College, Ames, Iowa The question as to whether pumpkins and squashes mix and as to which varieties are pumpkins and which are squashes has been debated among gardeners for a long time. Much of the present confusion re - garding these matters is due to lack of clear-cut definitions. In any discussion the first step is to clearly define the field. Many authorities have attempted to distinguish between the pumpkins and squashes on the basis of the place grown or the use of the product. Some authori- </seg>
            <seg id="p480">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ties, for example, suggest that squashes are grown in the garden and pumpkins in the field. Others state that squashes are for human con - sumption and pumpkins are for stock feed. Obviously these definitions will not hold. The only scientific method for the classification of plants is one based upon their botanical relationship. In the case of the Cucurbits, there are three species involved, two of which, the C. pepo and C. moschata, are clearly pumpkins, while the C. maxima is a true squash. The Connecticut Field pumpkin is a good example of the pepo type; the Large Cheese and Cushaws belong to the moschata species; and you are all familiar with the Hubbard squash which is a good example of maxima. There are a number of important characters' regarding the seed markings, shape and texture of the leaf and the flower which are characteristic of each of these species. These are illustrated in detail in the slides which are being presented; so I shall briefly refer to them here. One of the simplest and easiest earmarks which can be used to tell the difference between the pumpkin and squash is in the character of the stem , or the fruit stalk. In the pumpkins the stalk is hard and woody with pronounced ridges and furrows; whereas, in the squashes the stalk is swollen and cylindrical in shape rather than ridged and furrowed, and is soft and spongy instead of hard and woody. If you examine the stalk of a Connecticut Field pumpkin, for example, and compare it with that of a Hubbard squash, you have these two types of stalks. This is not the only difference, of course, but it is simply one of a number, which is easy to observe. I The Cucurbits comprise quite a large family with a long list of varieties. ■ Some of these varieties in turn have a long list of synonyms. However,, many of these varieties have certain characteristics in com - mon, and those which are so related are put into the - same group or type. Among apples, for example, we have certain varieties which belong to the Jonathan family, the Ben Davis family, etc. In the same way among the pumpkins we have several varieties which belong to the Connecticut Field group, etc. The following is a list of the groups of pumpkins, and under each group are included the varieties belonging to that particular type. </seg>

            <seg id="p482">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ! Do pumpkins and squashes mix ? In answering this question let us keep clearly in mind just what we mean by a pumpkin and a squash. We have made crosses of the Table Queen, for example, with the Small Sugar pumpkin. The Table Queen is commonly sold as a squash. In reality, however, as you will notice in the above groups, this variety belongs to the C. pepo, the same species to which the Small Sugar belongs. In other words, in this instance we have a cross not between a pumpkin and a squash, but between two varieties of pumpkins be - longing to the same species. A careful analysis of all of these sup - posed crosses between pumpkins and squashes shows the fact that it is really a misuse of terms that is involved. To put the proposition an - other way, the different varieties of pumpkins within the same species will readily cross. For example, we have a number of crosses of the Summer Crookneck and the Patty Pan. Both of these belong to the species pepo. On the other hand, these crosses seldom if ever cross specific lines. That is to say, the varieties in one species do not cross with the varieties in another species. In the case of the two species of pumpkins, out of some two thousand pollinations a few fruits were secured. Most of these were what we call parthenocarpic; that is, formed without the agency of sex and contained no seeds. In a few instances fertile seeds were secured in an actual cross between a pumpkin and a squash, but in the first generation of this cross the flowers proved to. be sterile. The staminate flowers, the male, were lacking in pollen sacks and the flowers were abortive. In other words, it was a good example of a mule hybrid. They were incapable of re - producing. Therefore, for all practical purposes we would say that pumpkins and squashes do not mix, using these terms as defined in this paper. MR.

THE PRESIDENT: We welcome you to our annual meeting and we hope that by your attendance and co-operation we will have a meeting beneficial to all and I hope all will take part in the discussions. The first subject on our program this morning is "Codling Moth Investigations in Nebraska," by Professor Myron H. : Swenk, ento - mologist of the University of Nebraska. </seg>
            <seg id="p483">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY CODLING MOTH INVESTIGATIONS IN NEBRASKA MYRON H. SWENK, Entomologist, , • Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station The most important insect pest of the apple in Nebraska, as else - where in the United States, is the codling moth or "apple worm". Orchardists all over the country spray their apple trees repeatedly season with arsenicals, usually with arsenate of lead, in order to keep this destructive insect pest under control. In recent years orchardists in Nebraska and other states have been unsuccessful in obtaining an entirely satisfactory control of the codling moth by the methods that have been in use. This has given rise to a demand that the Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station give aid to the apple growers of the state by ascertaining the causes of those cases of failure to secure good commercial control of the codling moth that occur, and also by suggesting how more satisfactory control may best be secured under present conditions. In response to this demand, early in 1926 the Department of Horti - culture and Entomology of the Station began work on cooperative projects that were designed to secure, the desired information. In these projects the Department of Horticulture was to conduct spraying experiments and demonstrations, employing different insecticides and varying the strength of the sprays, the number of spray applications and the types of coverage, while the Department of Entomology was to determine, by insectary studies the period and character of emergence and development of the various broods of eggs, larvae, pupae and adults of the codling moth, and correlate these with the synchronous temperature and humidity conditions. The object of this correlation was to reach, if possible, definite general conclusions on the relation of moth life-history to the weather. Because of the fact that the per - sonnel of the Department of Entomology was fully occupied with other projects and responsibilities during the season when life-history work 'on the codling moth would need to be done, it was unable to do any work on its side of the project during the summers of 1926 and 1927. The Department of Horticulture, however, was able to proceed with its spraying experiments, and collected a considerable amount of pertinent and valuable information. during those two seasons, summaries of which has been presented to this society at the past two meetings. By the beginning of 1928 circumstances had adjusted so that the Department of Entomology could proceed with its side of the project, and the present paper is a report on the first season of .work on the life-history of the codling moth. As is well known to you, the codling moth is controlled by spraying with arsenicals so that the larvae or "worms" will be poisoned • when </seg>
            <seg id="p484">REPOKT OK NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE they attempt to enter the fruit, or before, and in older to know when the spray applications should be made one should know when the larvae of the different broods are hatching- and entering. Recent work in other states has indicated that much of the recent failure to secure satisfactory control of the codling moth has been due to an improper synchronization of the cover sprays with the time the larvae or "worms" of the different broods begin to hatch preparatory to attacking the fruit. Spray schedules or "calendars" in which the time of applying the cover sprays are based upon calendar dates, or upon subsequence to blooming or petal fall, or upon the degree of development of the fruits, while usually fairly adequate as long as the insects go through their development according to the normal life-history schedule, fail badly when, because of seasonal variations in weather conditions, the insect makes radical departures from its normal developmental cycle, unless the orchardist overcomes this dislocation between spray time and larval activity by excessively frequent and heavy applications of spray. And if he does the latter he unnecessarily runs up expenses and faces an acute problem in increased spray residues. The great importance, therefore, of securing control by a minimum number of exactly timed cover sprays is apparent, and that is possible only by knowing the life-history and brood development of the codling moth during each season. An accumulation of such data over a period of years it is to be hoped may shed some light on the fundamental causes of the life-history variations of the insect. ' The principal life-history work done this past year (1928) was carried on at Lincoln. An open-air insectary was located in the Agri - cultural College orchard, in which daily counts and observations were made on the time and duration of the different broods of eggs, larvae, pupae and moths. A bait trap was also maintained in the Agricultural College orchard, to secure data on the flight of moths each night. For comparative purposes, three, similar bait traps were maintained in Mr. Grove Porter's orchard at Nebraska City, in the Union Fruit Farm at Union and in Shubert Brothers orchard at Shubert, respectively. Definition of Life History Terms Before proceeding with the discussion of the 1928 findings, probably a few definitions of life-history terms are desirable. A generation begins with the egg stage and ends with the moth stage. It may or may not be completed the same season that it begins. A brood includes the collective individuals of any stage in a generation — eggs, larvae, pupae or moths— and the various broods may be referred to according to the numerically sequent generation to which they belong: as "first - brood moths," "second-brood pupae," etc. The spring brood includes </seg>

It represents the completion of the carry-over generation. Any larvae surviving the winter, no matter to what brood of the pre - ceding season they may have belonged, are called wintering larvae. The pupae to which they give rise are the spring brood of pupae, and the moths emerging from the spring brood of pupae are the spring brood of moths. The egg-laying of the spring-brood moths forms the first brood of eggs; the larvae hatching from these eggs the first brood of larvae; the pupae into which these transform the first brood of pupae; and the resulting moths the first brood of moths. The egg - laying of the first-brood moths forms the second brood of eggs, etc. The life cycle of any generation includes the period from the deposition cf the egg to the emergence of the moth. The complete life cycle in - cludes the period from the deposition of the egg of one generation to the deposition of the egg of the next generation. The yearly life cycle includes the complete life cycles of all of the generations in any calendar year. ■ . Previous Work Although spraying experiments have been conducted in Nebraska by the Department of Horticulture of the College of Agriculture in quite a number of years since that work was begun in this state, in 1906, no previous work has been done on the life-history of the codling moth in this state except some general studies made by Professor J. Ralph Cooper in 1913, 1914 and 1915, which were reported upon by him in 1917. 1 Professor Cooper realized, in connection with the codling moth control, that "in order to spray efficiently a knowledge of the life history and habits of the insect is necessary," and so by both laboratory and field studies gathered data "from which to determine the proper dates of (spray) application." Professor Cooper found considerable variation in the life-history of the codling moth in the three seasons that he studied it, this variation being due, as he correctly stated, to. the' fact that the length of time necessary for eggs to hatch and for larvae to grow to maturity and transform to moths depends upon the temperature and weather conditions." He concluded that normally we have but two annual broods of larvae in Nebraska, but that in a- hot and dry season, like 1914, practically three full broods of larvae are developed, and the insect builds up a much greater abundance than it does in a cool, wet season. The variation in life-history a season with a heavy spring rainfall followed after the middle of June by hot weather with little rain, like 1913, a uniformly hot and dry season, like 1914, and a uni - ■See Bulletin 168 and Research Bulletin 10 or the Nebraska Agricultural Experi - ment Station (1917). </seg>

"Calyx" or "petal-fall" spray. To be applied immediately after the petals of the later blooming varieties fall, for first brood codling moth larvae when they later hatch and attempt to enter the young fruits. 2. First "cover" spray. To be applied normally two or three weeks after the "calyx" or "petal-fall" spray, at the time the first brood codling moth larvae begin to hatch. 3. Second "cover" spray. To be applied two weeks after the first cover spray as a supplementary spray against first brood codling moth larvae. ' 4. Third "cover" spray. To be applied just as the second brood codling moth larvae begin to hatch. 5. Fourth "cover" spray. To be applied two weeks later as a sup - plementary spray, against second brood codling moth larvae. 6. Fifth "cover" spray. To be applied if and when a strong third brood of larvae develops. . . </seg>
            <seg id="p488">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Based on his life-history studies, Professor Cooper recommended the following periods for the four more important of the various codling moth sprays: TABLE 2.

Subnormally low temperature all through June, however, slowed egg laying and the incubation of the first brood of eggs, so that the first brood of larvae appeared two or three weeks later than normal (June 23). July tem - peratures rising to normal hastened first brood larval development, so that pupation was only about a week later than normal (July 3). Moths of the first brood appeared at a practically normal date (July 13) and the appearance of their progeny, the second brood larvae, ■ was also practically normal in time (July 21). August temperatures were some - what lower than July temperatures, arid dropped to minima of 60 de - grees F. or less four times during the second half of the month. This slowed second brood larval development. Second brood moths ap - peared distinctly later than they would have if the second half of August had been hotter (September 9). September as a whole was slightly subnormal in temperatures, and the latter half had largely very sub - normal temperatures. This, delayed the first appearance of the third brood larvae by a month (September 25) and reduced the size of the third brood to negligible proportions. As has been stated, following his codling moth life history studies made in 1913, 1914 and 1915, Professor Cooper concluded that normally there are but two generations of the codling moth in Nebraska each year, but that in a hot and dry. season the species has three generations. But Professor Cooper's observations were obviously incomplete late in the season in two of these three years, and it is more likely that we normally have each year in Nebraska three generations of the codling moth, the third one often being delayed and weak, and overlapping </seg>
            <seg id="p489">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY somewhat with the second generation. The season of 1928 was about normal so far as precipitation was concerned, and only moderately above normal so far as temperatures are concerned, yet a small but distinct third brood developed the last half of September and the first half of October. Probably this takes place every year, but only in hot dry years is this brood accelerated and strengthened so as to be an economic problem. At Manhattan, Kansas, brood studies of the codling moth made in 1910, 1911 and 1912 caused Professor T. J. Headlee' to conclude that although it had long been assumed that there were two broods of the codling moth in Kansas, "it seemed very likely that the codling moth normally experiences two full broods and a partial third at Man - hattan." As you probably know, the codling moth passes the winter in the larval or "worm" stage in wintering cocoons tucked beneath the loose bark of the trees or in other protected places on or near the trees. Many larvae will form wintering cocoons under bands placed on the trees. These overwintering larvae are composed of all of the larvae of the third brood, and of the non-transforming larvae of the first and seccnd broods; chiefly, of course, of the second brood. The larvae are inactive during the winter, but in the spring they prepare their cocoons to enable the moths to escape easily. During late April and early May of 1928, 132 wintering larvae were collected from under bands in the Agricultural College orchard at Lin - coln and at Shubert Brothers' orchard at Shubert. These were placed in cocooning racks, which were kept in glass jars in the out-of-doors insectary in the Agricultural College orchard, under temperature con - ditions similar to those in the orchard itself, and were examined each day for evidence of pupation. The first pupation occurred on May 8, when larva pupated. On May 9, six larvae pupated and on May 11, ten pupated. The rate of pupation was, as usual, irregular, varying with the rise and fall of the temperature. The high point of pupation was May 24, on which day twenty-nine larvae pupated, bringing a 89.4 per cent of the larvae into pupation. The last of the 132 larvae pupated on June 5. The pupation period, therefore, covered exactly four weeks.

It will be noted that, due to prevailing higher temperatures, the preoviposition and oviposition periods were considerably shorter than these periods with the spring brood. These observations are shown in detail in the following table: </seg>

Do you mean the larvae? Q. Yes. A. They do survive as larvae. If they change to pupae late in the season they seldom go through the winter, but that depends on how late the season is. If they ever get to the full grown larvae stage they are safe. THE PRESIDENT: Would it be possible for those who are inter - ested to have a copy of your findings with regard to the life history of the codling moth during the season of 1928? I would like to have a summary of what you found out last year as a guide for the coming year. A. I would hesitate very much for you to use the data from this season as a guide for next year. Suppose the next year was hot and dry; then those figures wouldn't be worth anything. Q. I understand that, but I would like to have the information to compare with and to show me what I am up against in another year. A. I will ask Professor Hoppert whether this diagramatic chart of the codling moth life history can be reproduced and sent to the mem - bers. PROFESSOR HOPPERT: Yes, sir. We can arrange to do so. I can have a zinc etching made of this life history chart and have it ap - pear in the "Midwest Fruitman." MR. PORTER: The difficulty is these records come to us three or four years after these papers are given. If we could get them earlier we would like them. THE SECRETARY: Mr. Porter's remarks indicate that the Secre - tary is to blame for the tardiness of the appearance of the annual re - port. I am not to blame for all of the delay. As soon as I receive the report from reporters, I start editing it. Usually I find that some of the papers are slow about being sent in. Then the corrected manuscripts and the edited report are turned over to the Secretary of the Board of Agriculture for printing. He in turn submits the report to various printers for bids according to law. Then there is further delay in setting up the type, proofreading, etc. By the time we get the finished printed reports back about twelve months have rolled around. I don't know whether this time can be shortened greatly or not. However, I usually summarize the various papers given here for our monthly news, notes in the Midwest Fruitman, which all of our members receive. I can </seg>

THE PRESIDENT: Our next subject is "The 1928 Spray Plats at Shubert," by W. W. Yocum, of Lincoln. "THE 1928 SPRAY PLATS AT SHUBERT" W. W. YOCUM, of Lincoln I'm sure if you have thought about it that you can pretty well anticipate what the results were from experimental spraying in 1928. It seems that the unusually clean apple crop of this section last season was one. thing that the politicians overlooked in counting the blessings and benefits of the last administration. I'm surprised that they didn't claim the credit for it. Though the apple crop here was not great in quantity, it certainly was fine in quality. That was most unusual, too, for we generally ex - pect a light crop to be much more wormy accordingly than heavy crops. This is because it is hard to get a good coverage of spray material when ■ the fruits are scattered and hard to see. Somehow it seems that we have to see something to spray for 'before we get an even cover. Per - haps our growers are getting to be better sprayers, and I believe they are. At least few growers had any difficulty in controlling the codling moth last year in Nebraska. But we are not inclined to take too much credit for our thorough spraying. We know that when we find only two or three wormy apples in 1000 that such control is due in part at least to something also be - side spraying. The unusually warm weather of last March followed by the cold snaps of April seems to have been quite as destructive and weakening to the codling moth as to the fruit buds. So up until the time of the second cover spray, June 15, we could scarcely find any worms entering the fruit even in unsprayed orchards. There were plenty of stings, but the early worms seemed too weak to make an entrance into the fruit At any rate, the infestation of codling moth was so slight in 1928 that most any spray containing arsenate of lead that was applied thor - oughly and at the right time, gave fine control of the -worms. The differences in results in our different spray plats at Shubert were so slight that we are not able to tell whether one schedule is better than another. The worms were well controlled in practically all cases and the slight differences seem to be due to other factors quite as much as the spray material. But perhaps it will be worth while to show you the results from our experimental spraying, even though the results are not very marked. </seg>

            <seg id="p505">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Perhaps you have not realized fully how clean your fruit was last year or how easy it was to keep the worms off. In not one of the eight plats in the young orchard did we find more than ten wormy apples per 1000 — less than 1 per cent The number of stings was correspondingly low — less than 8 per. cent. There is one thing that we do stress in this experimental spraying and that is a thorough application of the material. And you see that in all plats we had excellent control. In fact the differences are so slight that we can't say one method of spraying is better than another. But I do think this shows the value of thorough application of some arsenical spray. We had hoped to learn more as to the value of oil in the summer sprays. You probably know the claims made for these light summer oils by their manufacturers and some experimenters. It is claimed that the oil acts as an ovicide, destroying the eggs of the codling moth and some other insects by smothering the life out of them. Then the^oil acts as a spreader, giving a more uniform and complete cover of tfie arsenate of lead used with it. Also the oil is supposed to stick or hold the lead on the fruit for a longer time. We have thought that by using oil early in the season with lead that the lead would have a more lasting effect, and the number of lead sprays might be kept down. We have been using oil alone late in the season for its ovicidal value if it has any, and because we wished to be safe from arsenical spray residue. But we will need to try again before we can say anything more about the value of oil. We will probably use much the same outline in 1929 as the one that was followed in' 1928. There will be slight changes, of course, but we feel that this plan has not been tested yet. In the old orchard, while there were more worms, it was quite different to the ordinary year. Here the percentage of wormy fruit ranged from 3 to 11 per cent. In 1927 these percentages ranged as high as 56 per cent for sprays and 76 per cent under dust. There does not seem to be any marked differences here in results from the different spray plats. While plats No.- 1 and 8 would seem to show up the oil sprays as not so beneficial, yet when we compare this to the results for 1927 we find that these were the plats that were dusted in 1927. And we are inclined to think that part of this larger percentage is due to the carry over effect from dusting. Keeping down the infestation certainly pays in succeeding years. The most significant thing about our results this year seems to be the carry over effect of the heavier in - festation on certain plats in 1927. Plat No. 8 in the young orchard was dusted in 1927, and there the percentage of worms is highest this year. Well it seems that those who have sprayed as they should will have a clean slate to begin work with in 1929, that is, a low infestation of </seg>

            <seg id="p507">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY worms. I believe it will pay to get and keep that infestation as low as possible. This can be lowered still more by a general clean up. Scrape off the scaly bark from old trees and remove old stumps and snags from the orchard where the worms hibernate during the winter. Occasionally we find need for a few larvae in spring' and we have found that one of the surest places to find them is in the cracks of old stumps or snags of trees. In such places they are well protected from extreme weather of winter. Then clean up the packing sheds especially the cull bin. If it is a fairly tight building it may be best to screen the windows and keep from escaping any moths that [hatch there in spring. Then by thoro spraying next season we should plan to hold the edge on the worms next season. These results will be on display in the room across the hall, where you can inspect them thoroughly and at closer range. Spray Residue I have some other information for you which I think should prove quite interesting at this time. This has to do with the spray residue problem. In so far as the apple industry is concerned the residue prob - lem is for the most part tied up with the control of the codling moth. After a long fight against this pest in which, there has been a trend toward more and heavier dosages of arsenate of lead this residue problem has arisen as a final complication. To many fruit growers this has appeared as the last straw to break the camel's back, or as a' slough of despair. The storm of criticism against spray residue had been brewing for some years and in 1926 and 1927 it broke over the heads of the fruit growers in all - its fury. American apples of the 1925 crop produced a great scare on the English market. It caused an uprising against any fruit being offered for sale there which carried more spray residue than their established tolerance of 0.01 grain of arsenic per pound of fruit. Then in March, 1926, the Bureau of Chemistry of the U. S. D. A. issued a warning that all fruit offered for sale on the domestic market must also be cleaned, though no definite tolerance was stated. The irrigated districts of the Northwest were most seriously affected by these and subsequent regulations. We are well acquainted with the des - perate and successful struggle they have made to solve this problem. We know that codling moth control in different' sections is affected by the intensity of the codling moth infestations and by climatic condi - tions. In many orchards of the arid western sections, control of the codling moth at present is possible only by very heavy spraying, and in many orchards even the heaviest spraying is inadequate. The lack of rainfall, greatly increases the difficulty of controlling the codling moth </seg>
            <seg id="p508">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE and makes the residue problem more serious by causing the arsenical residue to persist on the fruit to a much greater extent than it does in some of the more humid sections. In most of the arid sections the cod - ling moth cannot be controlled without excessive residue. Spray sched - ules which discontinue spraying as early as July. 1, may leave a residue at harvest time of several times the world tolerance and the American tolerance of .01 grain per pound of fruit. At the other extreme are the cool, humid orchard sections of the northeast. There the codling moth can be controlled with little difficulty, and the rainfall is heavy enough to reduce the residue to a safe point. But what about spray residue in this section? We have been won - dering, yet dreading to say. much about it. In the middle Atlantic and middle west sections conditions are intermediate between the extremes and vary considerably from year to year. In many seasons there will probably be no difficulty of any kind; in other seasons spray residue diffi - culties are apt to occur unless unusual precautions are taken to avoid them. The states to the south of Nebraska have a heavier infestation of codling moth on the average than does Nebraska, due probably to a longer growing season with higher temperatures. So it seems that eastern Nebraska is more favorably situated for controlling the codling moth with a minimum of residue than the states south. We decided to get some information on the residue situation in southeast Nebraska this last year. Samples of apples were taken from each of our spray plats at Shubert and analyzed for arsenic. These apples were gathered from various parts of two trees in each plat. Here are the results from the plats in the old Jonathan orchard. Remember that the minimum amount of arsenic residue that will be tolerated on fruit on either home or foreign markets after January 1, 1929 is .01 grains per pound of fruit. Here you see, the general average for the entire old orchard was only a little over half that amount. In only one case did the amount seem near the limit. Then here are the data for the two varieties Winesaps and Missouri Pippins in the young orchard plats. I want you to notice especially again the grand averages. These are less than half the tolerance standard. The residue here is less than in the old orchard because one less spray was applied to most plats and perhaps less material was used accordingly. To spray thoroughly the tops of the old trees it was necessary to use more material than on the young trees, all parts of which were easily reached. </seg>
            <seg id="p509">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY In considering this data it is well to remember that we did a very thorough job of spraying, so that most of our plats probably showed more residue than would fruit from the average commercial orchard. Well this looks rather encouraging doesn't it? But we must not be too op - timistic about it, for we had some very favorable conditions this past season. In both orchards the second cover spray for the second brood was omitted. The moth traps did not indicate a need for this spray. Then the low temperatures early in the season and heavy rainfall through - out the summer made control of the worms relatively easy. Also the excess rainfall helped remove the spray residue more than we can usually expect. For the six months, April, May, June, July, August and Septem - ber, the rainfall at Falls City was 31.59 in., at Auburn 26.3 in., at Ne - braska City 22.04 in. The average annual rainfall for this section is 32 inches. As I see it, we must do all in our power to control the first brood of worms, by thorough and timely spraying. Supplementary and sanitary measures before the -spraying season opens should be stressed more, also. The codling moth should be studied in our individual orchards so that no unnecessary sprays will be applied before the worms appear and the residue increased without reason. The intelligent use of moth traps and cages will help reduce the number of sprays and the amount of residue. So keep on the job early and then don't worry about residue until you have to. We hope from our experimental spraying to be able to help you keep the number of sprays to a minimum and the arsenical residue below the tolerance limit. Discussion ANSWERS BY W. W. YOCUM W. W. YOCUM: Remember that the world tolerances and the American tolerances are the same now. They are both .01 grain of arsenic per pound of fruit. The average in all of these tests in the old orchards was about one-half of the limit, or .005 grain of arsenic per pound rather than .01 - which is the smallest amount of arsenic which will be tolerated. MR. PORTER: What was the spray schedule for that fruit, the amount you used straight thru? W. W. YOCUM: Plat No. 1 had 4 pounds to the 100 gallons of water for the first cover spray, and then 2 pounds to the hundred and then 1% per cent Orthol K. There were three sprays for the first brood and one for the second brood. Then plat No. 2 had 4 pounds of lead arsenate to the 100. That is more than you use ordinarily. The other </seg>
            <seg id="p510">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE plats used various amounts of lead arsenate, with or without the oil sprays as you can see in the chart. . MR. PORTER: Do you know the result of the last spray? W. W. YOCUM: No, not ordinarily — it was late in July this year. MR. PORTER: Ordinarily you would finish spraying about the 15th of August? W. W. YOCUM: Yes. This year we put on one less spray than is usually necessary. MR. TURK: I might ask where you got that residue in the fruit analysis ? W. W. YOCUM: We got that from the apples which we brought to the chemist here at the Agricultural College. They removed the peel - ings or took the skins off and analyzed them and determined the amount of arsenic left from the spraying. MR. BAKER: What time did you gather this fruit, at the regular harvest time? MR. YOCUM: Yes. MR. PORTER: You picked Jonathan for one of your tests and Missouri Pippins and Winesaps for the other? MR. YOCUM: Yes, sir. MR. PORTER: Were they picked all at the same time? MR. YOCUM: No. MR. PORTER: Pippins and Winesaps would hang on the trees longer and would stand a stronger dose of lead? MR. YOCUM: Yes, perhaps so. If there is more rainfall more of the lead arsenate would be removed. MR. PORTER: Did you find that varieties with an open calyx had a higher per cent of lead? . The Pippins, for example, have an open calyx. Would they be likely to have a greater residue than varieties with a closed calyx? MR. YOCUM: The results secured this year do hot seem to indicate that this is the case. THE PRESIDENT: Our next subject is "Pruning and Training Young Fruit Trees," by Professor R. H. Roberts, of Madison, Wis. </seg>
            <seg id="p511">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY PRUNING AND TRAINING YOUNG FRUIT TREES PROFESSOR R. H. ROBERTS, Madison, Wisconsin The modified leader tree has been the type very largely adopted by most fruit growers in recent years. Its superior advantages, however, justify its much wider use for apples, pears, cherries and possibly for plums and peaches. Some advantages of this type of tree are: Freedom from weak crotches such as occur in the open center tree; a lower, more spreading tree than the central leader type; a large number of main branches giving a top in which the branches grow uniformly; and a better fruiting system than in other types of trees. What do I mean by a modified leader tree? First of all it is not a two story tree with two sets of scaffold branches. Neither is it a central leader tree with the center cut out "after two or three years." The young modified leader is a tree with the central branch left in, but cut back so as to be only slightly longer than the side branches. These side branches are well balanced with the leader to produce a low spreading tree as contrasted with the tall, narrow, central leader tree on the "two story tree" where the upper whorl of scaffold branches outgrow the lower story. From seven to nine such main branches are left during the course of the first three or four years. They are dis - tributed on the main trunk from a point about two to two and one-half feet from the ground to a point about six feet from the ground. No two branches directly over each other should be closer than two feet. Now that I have given you a description of my ideal in a fruit tree, let me describe to you the way in which this type of tree is secured and some of the difficulties you will run into. I will try to give you some methods to use to overcome some of the difficulties. Pruning the Newly Set Tree Let's start with the young tree that has just been set out. Person - ally I prefer the one year whip as a transplant because there is less danger of its not growing than where the two-year-old is used, and. because it is easier to secure the proper distribution of branches and easier to keep these branches in balance. Since most of you here prefer the two-year-old tree we ought to begin with such a tree, however. ■ After your two-year-old tree has been set out it needs pruning to get it to start growth. Too much top left is a detriment as you all know. Here then is the time to start right. If your tree has two leaders one ought to be cut out entirely, especially if it has a weak crotch. If the crotch is strong one of these may be left to make a side branch by cutting it shorter than the leader. Then the shorter branch will grow less than </seg>
            <seg id="p512">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE the longer because growth depends upon the leaf surface and the mere leaves a branch has the more rapid will be its growth other things being equal. In addition to the leader we will want two or three or even four side branches. If you can select wide angled branches, one on each side of the tree and with four to six inches between each two, fine. That is rather unusual, though, because most nurserymen take off the lower wide angled branches and leave the sharp angled branches near the cut made when the one-year old whip was headed back. These sharp angled branches are very likely to produce crotches that split easily. If there are no other branches than these sharp angle ones on your tree you had better make a whip of the tree and start making a real tree. The lowest branch should be about twenty to twenty-four inches from the ground so that you can get a rabbit protector under it. With cherries it is best to have no more than 3 side branches. . Ex - perience has taught us that if the side branches are close together and all the way around the trunk, then the central branch or leader will be starved out even though it is left longer to begin with. So with cherries see that one side of the tree is left without a branch low down so that the leader may get part of the sap flow. Now after you have left the side branches and leader comes the next step, namely, to shorten the branches. The object of this short - ening is to get the scaffold branches to branch and to balance them up so that all sides of the tree will have good producing wood later on. This heading back should be done according to the vigor of the branches. Weak branches should be left relatively longer than strong branches. The lower branches are left a little longer than upper side branches since the upper branches usually grow better. For most varieties the actual length to which they are headed back is eighteen to twenty inches. If they are cut much shorter than this, there is insufficient circumfer - ence to allow unhindered development of side branches. The leader is left slightly longer than the laterals about three or four inches being sufficient to maintain the supremacy of the leader. The tendency of trees in this state seems to be to grow to the north and heading to a bud on the south or southwest counteracts the tendency. Don't make the mistake of leaving the leader too long or your trees will become two story trees. The laterals are cut to buds on the outside to promote spreading of the branches. </seg>
            <seg id="p513">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Second Year Pruning Mistakes made at this stage in the life of the orchard can be over - come cnly at considerable expense and delay in the development of the fruitful tree. First of all extra branches coming from the trunk should be removed. Remember that ideal that we set up in the beginning, namely, that our tree is to have from seven to nine main scaffold branches from a point two feet from the ground to a point six or seven feet from the ground. Now choose some of these additional scaffold branches remembering that no two of these that are on the same side of the tree should be closer than two feet where they spring from the trunk. In selecting these main branches avoid bad crotches just as you did last year. Then remove crowding and crossing branches and those that grow back toward the center of the tree. Now if the variety you are pruning makes plenty of side branches there is no need to head back the new scaffold branches except to balance them so that all will grow about equally fast. The leader is again left a little longer than the side branches. If one of the- older scaffold branches is outgrowing the others then cut some of its branches away. Don't let a side branch occupy more than one quarter of the side of the tree. For example if the main branch on the north is trying to hog the west side also, better cut out the branches that are trying to do this. The west side should be filled from a main branch that arises from the trunk rather than by side branches that come from the north scaffold branch. The Third Year . As a rule systematic shaping of the tree is also needed when it is three years old. Crossing and crowding and useless branches should be removed as in the previous year. Tipping is usually unnecessary except on some varieties that do not branch freely and to balance the main laterals. Those branches which tend to grow too strongly are severely - cut back. Where trees are deformed by prevailing winds better balance may be secured by cutting heaviest on the side away from the wind. The Fourth Year It is generally believed that, there should be very little pruning done during the four to six year period. Heavy pruning at this time maintains the tree in a vegetative condition and as a consequence tends </seg>

            <seg id="p515">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY to retard fruiting-. There is no good reason, however, why extra and crossing branches should not be removed and the tree kept in balance. Very often trees do not begin -to bear even after they are five or six years old and are large enough to fruit well. In some cases the top has become so dense that light conditions are too poor for blossom bud formation. Pruning in the dormant season to open up such trees would not be practical because suckers usually fill in such openings. This over - density of the tree can be overcome by thinning out the top in early summer after the new terminal shoots are several inches long. No tip - ping is done, however. Suckers are not likely to start and the top will be cpen to the sunlight during the time when the blossom buds are differ - entiated. Or three or four of the central branches can be bent outward and tied down to open up the center. THE PRESIDENT: Are there any questions you would like to ask Mr. Roberts about this important topic? If so now is the time. MR. STEVENSON: How about pruning the young cherry tree? MR. ROBERTS: The bearing cherry tree is subject to three types of weakness. Splitting of weak crotches, weak leaders that are starved out by strong scaffold branches, and the "southwest" injury or sunscald. Q. How shall we overcome these? A. I have already spoken of overcoming weak crotches namely by selecting wide angles branches for your main limbs. To prevent dwarf - ing of the leader and finally having it starve to death see to it that you select a strong leader to begin with and then have your main scaffold branches so distributed that the sap flow to the leader is not obstructed. If for example you leave four strong side branches one on each side of the leader, these side branches will take nearly all of the sap flow and the leader: will starve out. Of course it is possible some times to make a new leader out of the strongest side branch but if all of the side branches are strong the tendency will be to have a badly crotched tree that will split into four parts. We find that it is easier to secure the desired type of tree when one year old trees are used for transplants. The so-called "southwest" injury is probably not much affected by the way the young tree is headed. It looks as tho low heading and leaning the tree toward the southwest ought to help some and having a good strong branch on the southwest ought to help some more. No doubt such trees as this are less subject to sunscald but they are not en - tirely free from it even then. Shading the southwest side of the trunk </seg>

' THE PRESIDENT: We will have Professor Roberts with us again this afternoon. It is now time for our business meeting and we would like to have as many as care to stay for that. We will first hear the report of the secretary. REPORT OF THE SECRETARY E. H. HOPPERT During the year 1928 the activities of the Horticultural Society were not as varied and numerous as has been the case in some previous years. The early spring freezes were partly to blame. The tree fruits were so badly injured at this time that nearly all of them were exceedingly short at harvest time. In the vicinity of Nebraska City that was true especially It was deemed inadvisable therefore to hold our usual summer tour thru the southeastern part of the state. This is one of the popular activities sponsored by the Society that was omitted the past year. Another of the activities that was omitted entirely was the Society apple exhibit at the Midwest Horticultural Exposition. This show was held this year at Cedar Rapids, Iowa. The auditorium in which the show was staged did not lend itself well for large displays and furthermore none of the neighboring states seemed interested in putting up an ex - hibit such as was done at Kansas City last year and at Des Moines the previous year. For these reasons the Nebraska exhibit was dropped this year. In spite of the short fruit crop, however, we did have a fine dis - play at the State Fair. The big central feature of the Horticultural Society display created a lot of comment by State Fair visitors. The central idea this year was that "Cornhuskerland Grows Good Fruit." A large ear of corn was built up out of Grimes Golden apples and this was banked with trays of Jonathans and Delicious. Cornstalks were used around the borders for decoration. The amateur flower display was the best ever shown and the ex - hibits were more numerous than ever before. Unquestionably these exhibits are helping to stimulate the interest in back yard flower gardens. A new feature was added to the horticultural displays this year by .the Nurserymen's Association, namely, a display of evergreens arranged formally about a birdbath.

In addition an attendant was with the display to answer questions regarding- the various trees. Another important phase of the Horticultural Society activities is the sponsoring of winter meetings at Lincoln. We had sessions that were of interest to vegetable growers, fruit growers and one session for those interested in beautifying the home grounds. All sessions were well attended. Speakers from outside the state were secured for each of these sessions.' Mr. C. V. Holsinger, extension horticulturist from Ames, Iowa, talked on "Roadside Marketing of Vegetables" and "The Use of Modern Machinery in Vegetable Gardening." Mr. Paul Stark of Louisiana, Missouri, president of "Apples for Health, Incorporated," told of the need for advertising the apple and explained the proposed scheme for giving national advertising to the apple. Professor R. J. Barnett of Manhattan, Kansas, told of various experiments he conducted in soil fertility in young orchards. Prof. Roy Marshall of the Agricul - tural College at East Lansing, Michigan, talked* on "Packing Houses and Packing Equipment for Apples." He illustrated his talk with lantern slides. In addition,' of course, we had other good numbers given by various people from within the state. The attendance at all sessions was about all that the room used for this purpose would hold. The society also authorized the secretary to make a trip to the Michigan and Wisconsin cherry sections to study this important in - dustry and take pictures illustrating important steps in producing cher - ries, said pictures to be used to illustrate his report to the society. This was done. The report will be given this afternoon and the pictures shown at that time. The secretary was also authorized to attend the horticultural science meetings at New York City the last week in December and to report back on the papers given that might be of interest to Nebraska fruit growers. The report on this trip will also be given this afternoon. Several meetings were held of the cedar rust committee appointed by the president. Mr. Gates of the department of agriculture was noti - fied of the damage done the past year to apples by cedar rust. He made a trip to Nebraska City and Peru to look into the matter. How - ever, Secretary McLaughlin could not be persuaded to invoke the present nursery law for removal of cedars that are doing the damage. It was suggested that the secretary secure the written opinion of the attorney general as to the sufficiency of the law in this connection. His report was favorable. But still the secretary of agriculture would not act. Therefore we are presenting this matter this afternoon for your con - sideration and action. </seg>

            <seg id="p520">f REPOUT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE I have another matter to bring up in this meeting. The fruit in - dustry should be taken care of in a better way. than has been the case in the past. There is a new organization which has been formed which would like our support, it is called the "National Horticultural Council." I have here a synopsis or resume of what their purpose is. This or - ganization is asking for assistance and support. It is interested in some things that we as horticulturalists are interested in, namely, the tariff on bananas and other imported fruits and vegetables; they are also interested in the proper labeling of fruit juices and extracts. Vari - ous other state societies are joining and supporting them with a sub - scription of $25.00 per society. Local organizations can't do very much unless they are grouped together in a national organization. Mr. Charles E. Durst — you all know who he is — is secretary of this organization, I would like to see this matter discussed and voted upon. MR. PORTER: I move that the Nebraska State Horticultural So - ciety assist in supporting this movement to the extent of $26.00. Seconded by Mr. Baker. The motion was put and carried unanimously. THE SECRETARY: There is another matter and that is the ad - vertising of the apple. There has been an organization formed that has for its purpose the national advertising of the quality of apples for health fruit movement. We can take no action here, but I want to call your attention to the work that has been done and the work that it is possible to do in increasing the consumption of apples particularly. If you have a good crop next year I hope you will get back of this move - ment. Paul Stark is president of the corporation. We can all benefit by having the apple advertised. There are many angles which the public should be acquainted with, the value of apples in the diet, etc. While the advertising fund will be based upon . the apple production, namely, one cent per bushel, the membership fee is $5.00 per year; that seems like a large amount, but if it increases our sales and the price of apples well and good. At least every indication points to that fact as it does in other countries. In England they just put on a campaign and the quantity of fruit consumed was greatly increased in spite of the coal strike. I have given the names of the fruit growers who might be interested and when that material comes to you I want you to give it some thought so that the movement will be supported. I am not going to ask for a vote on that, but this is some information you ought, to have. Then there is another proposition you might be interested in and that is the American Pomological Society which has made a club rate to Horticultural Society members of twenty-five cents per year for their magazine which they get out. It has purely fruit articles in it, so if there are twenty-five- members of the society who want that magazine </seg>
            <seg id="p521">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY at twenty-five cents apiece we might vote on it here. I have here a copy of the magazine (indicating).

WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON SESSION January 9, 1929 The third session of the convention was called to order by President Shubert at 2:00 o'clock Wednesday afternoon. THE PRESIDENT: The next subject on the program is "What System of Pruning Shall We Use With Grapes?" by Professor C. C. Wiggans, Lincoln. WHAT SYSTEM OF PRUNING SHALL WE USE WITH GRAPES? PROFESSOR C. C. WIGGANS, Lincoln The grape is one of the more widely grown fruits found in Ne - braska and interest in the methods of producing it is general. Among the practices about which there is more or less argument is pruning. Some maintain that this fruit should be pruned this way and some that — and the surprising thing about it is, that, regardless of the method of pruning used, a fair crop is generally secured. Therefore, each method has its vigorous defenders. </seg>
            <seg id="p523">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY An analysis of the various 'recommendations found in literature and also of the practices followed by practical growers shows that grape pruning falls into two general classes — spur and cane pruning, or as it is sometimes called, short and long pruning. No matter what type of training is followed, the fruiting canes for the next crop are left of reasonable length (six to ten buds) or are shortened to two or three bud spurs. Very little experimental evidence is at hand showing the relative value of these methods. Only hearsay evidence or best meager data are available. As a consequence about eight years ago, just as a newly planted vineyard was developing, the Department of Horticulture at this institution found a good opportunity to study the problem. It is a' summary of the results which have been secured that is to be presented here. Experimental Material and Methods The plants upon which this report is based were set in 1918 on the Experiment Station grounds here at Lincoln. The Concord variety was used. Spacing was 8x9 feet with six rows of twenty-one plants each. Clean culture has been the rule, with one medium heavy application of barnyard manure about 1922. For the first two or three years the pruning employed with the various rows was identical, but a differentiation in methods was begun in 1920 and 1921. An attempt was made to establish both single and double trunk vines, each of which could be pruned either to spurs or canes. Thus we finally had one row pruned to a single trunk with spur renewal, another a single trunk with cane renewal, another a double trunk with cane renewal and a fourth double trunk with spur renewal. The other two rows were not included in the experiment at first, but were later brought in for alternating the cane and spur pruning — that is, the plants were spur-pruned cne year and cane-pruned the next, or vice versa. The differentiation in pruning methods was really not complete until 1922. The 1920 and 1921 crops were of small significance and are not included in the report. In this work an attempt was made to record accurately the per - formance of each individual bud pn the plants under experiment. It was recorded whether a given bud was alive or dead, whether a living bud was barren or fruitful; and in case the bud was a' producing one, .the number of clusters with the individual weights. Data covering these points is practically complete for the- years 1922-1928, inclusive, except for the year 1925 when a freeze on May 24 destroyed practically the whole crop. </seg>
            <seg id="p524">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Experimental Data So far as possible the number of buds left remaining on the plants were approximately the same. For instance, if six canes, eight buds, in length were left (as was the case in 1922) on one set of plants, six - teen three-bud spurs were left on the spur pruned vines. (The three - bud length was chosen as being most nearly representative of the crdinary practice.) In addition the cane pruned plants ordinarily car - ried two or three two-bud renewal spurs. Thus, the total number of buds en the cane-pruned plants will average slightly higher . than in the case of the spur-pruned ones. The accompanying table shows the total number of vines from which records were made in the various years and also the yearly average so far as the number of buds are concerned. It will be noted that in 1922 the average number is some - what low — due to the fact that the plants as yet had not reached the full productive stage. Also cane-pruned plants in 1928 had an unduly large number of buds due to an error in leaving the canes too long. The ideal in all years except those noted has been to have approximately sixty buds per plant distributed on six canes or on twenty spurs.

The first determination made was the relative percentage of pro - ductive buds, this being 65.6 per cent in the case of cane-pruned plants and 63.7 per cent with the spur-pruned ones. In this same connection data were taken for two years, 1927-28, showing the performance of the buds according to their location on the spur or cane. Bud No. 1 was the bud nearest the base of the cane or spur. The following table presents the figures secured here: </seg>

It will be noted that with the cane-pruned plants the percentage of producing buds increased from the base of the cane outward with the highest point being reached between buds Nos. 4 and 6. Beyond bud 6 the number of fruiting buds decreased. On the other hand, spur pruning apparently forced a much greater number of basal buds (that is, Nos. 1 and 2) into activity, al - though the production percentage of the first three buds is slightly in favor of cane pruning (67.1 per cent to 64.6 per cent). The next point in which we were interested was cluster number and size. A large number of buds with a small individual production might fail to counteract the greater number and size of bunches from a lesser number of buds.

            <seg id="p526">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE From the calculations just given it will be observed that on the average buds on cane-pruned plants produced both more and larger clusters. When the average production per bud is calculated this differ - ence is emphasized further — the buds on the cane-pruned plants each producing 77.3 grams of fruit, while those on the spur-pruned vines produced only 71.2 grains. The advantage in fayor of the former is almost 9 per cent. For the years 1927-1928 records have also been compiled showing the performance of the individual buds on each cane or spur.

How - ever, if cluster weights alone are considered, it is found that these increase more or less uniformly as the distance from the base of the cane is increased. Production judged by the total amount of fruit produced (number of clusters multiplied by the average weight) is found to be highest at the sixth bud in the case of the cane-pruned plants and at the second bud on the spurs. Incidentally, the average production of the spur buds is somewhat higher than the production on the first three buds on the canes. Along with the yield data, of course, other things came in — brought in by a desire to find the explanation for any results which might be found. So a series of measurements of sub-tending leaf surfaces were made. The size of the primary leaf was kept separate from that of any </seg>
            <seg id="p527">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY other sub-tending leaf surface which. might be present due to the de - velopment of auxiliary growth. In both cases the leaf area sub-tending the first few nodes was found to be significantly less than that of nodes farther out on the cane. Figures gathered in 1924 and again in 1927 indicate that the greatest sub-tending leaf surface is found in the region of the 5th or 6th bud. Beyond that point the curve goes down - ward. Possible explanations for this might be (1) a lower temperature at time of development; (2) a lessened amount of sunlight, and (3) the leaves at the more distant nodes having a shorter time for development It is entirely reasonable to suppose that the greater leaf surface may possibly account for the greater production in this region (5th to 7th buds). Chemical analyses were also made of short portions of the vines in the region of the 1st, 5th and 9th nodes. Moisture, sugar, starch and protein determinations were made. The differences found were so small as to seem insignificant — thus bearing out the conclusions of other workers. In 1926, and again in 1927, a record was made of the prunings re - moved, separating them into two parts, old wood and new growth, and weighing each portion. Nearly 25 per cent more wood was removed from the cane-pruned plants, but of more significance is the fact that 22.4 per cent of the total in this case was wood more than one year old, while with the spur-pruned plants only 10 per cent was old wood. This indicates an increasingly larger amount of old wood remaining on the plant in the latter case and this might be very significant as the plant becomes still older. Of perhaps more practical significance is the relative amount of time required to prune the plants to the respective systems. Data taken in only one season and with only a few plants indicated that the spur pruning is possibly 10 per cent faster than the other. This is true regardless of the fact that nearly 25 per cent more cuts were re - quired on the spur-pruned vines. The larger number of cuts, however, were made usually through only one year wood and hence could be made much faster and easier. Also the removal of prunings from the wires was easier and made with less danger of injury to the remainder of the plant than when long canes were present. At harvest time while no data was collected — general observations seemed to warrant the conclusion that the time advantage was in the other direction be - cause of the much greater tangle in' the spurred plants. </seg>
            <seg id="p528">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OK AGRICULTURE General Conclusions The following general conclusions may be presented based on the work done to date: 1. Cane pruning of the Concord gave a higher percentage of fruit - ing buds. 2. Cane pruning produced more and larger clusters per bud — thus giving a 9 per cent increase in total production. This difference was less marked when the plants were young and quite vigorous. 3. The most productive bud on the spur-pruned plant was No. 2, while buds Nos. 6 and 7 gave the highest yield on the canes. 4. The percentage of productive buds, the average number of clusters per bud and the average production per bud increased until bud 6 or 7 on the cane was reached. Beyond this point a decline occurred. 5. The average cluster size increased rather uniformly as the dis - tance from the base of the cane increased. 6. Leaf area — both primary and on sub-tending shoots — followed approximately the same general curve as production — showing at least a suggested correlation. 7. Cane-pruned plants were generally more vigorous judged by the weight of prunings removed. Also these prunings contained over twice the amount of old wood as those taken from spurred plants. 8. The time of pruning is slightly in favor of spur pruning even though fewer cuts are required with the other. ' -. ■ - ' • '*'■ General Recommendations Cane pruning the Concord grape is advised for the grape grower because of the greater ease with which the average operator can follow the directions given for this method. The main difficulty encountered with spur pruning is the tendency to simply shear the plant. In many instances this leaves entirely too many fruiting buds on the plant with a reduction in vigor the inevitable result. Canes of 8 or 9 bud length seem to be more fruitful proportionately than longer ones. In leaving the proper number of buds, it would seem more advisable, therefore, to leave a larger number of the shorter - length canes instead of longer ones, so as to give the proper number of buds,, is probably more advisable. </seg>
            <seg id="p529">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Discussion Answers by PROFESSOR C. C. WIGGANS MR. PORTER: We planted our grapes on very rich ground and got an awful heavy growth. I was wondering about how many buds you would recommend on good strong ground in that section? A. I have seen plants around Brownville that would carry seventy - five and in some cases ninety buds. These are plants which I think will carry ninety in the average season. Q. What about the age of vines — take a three-year-old vine on exceptionally rich ground, about how many buds would you suggest, A. On three-year-old plants, I wouldn't want to leave too many. The third year you should establish the main trunk with perhaps a few canes on the side. I should think that three canes is as much as you ought to ever leave and from that down. The maximum would be about thirty buds. Q. Our trouble has been excessive foliage or growth all the way through. A. Under those circumstances perhaps' you have been cutting too heavy. It is just a case of forcing into these buds that are left such a great amount of nitrogen and moisture that a tremendous growth occurs. The remedy is to leave a larger number of buds — don't prune too heavy. Q. What spacing do you have? A. Eight to ten feet. • Q. How high is your trellis? A. Five feet with two wires. If you had a three-wire trellis you could distribute your canes in better shape and your picking expense would be reduced. Q. On rich ground such as we have, you would recommend leaving considerable more buds? A. Yes." •MR. PORTER: As a matter of fact we have rich soil and I think we are doing wrong to limit them to four canes. MR. YATES: Would the distance you have these hills apart make a difference in the number of buds you could leave? A. Yes, to a certain extent. Q. I put my hills further apart. </seg>
            <seg id="p530">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ■ A. Then you can leave more buds. Q. I could leave more buds and have my hills further apart than you could on thinner land? A. What you have to do is to regulate the number of buds on the plant according to the vigor of the plant. If the vine is making very little growth the best thing to do is to prune it heavily, thus forcing more vigorous growth from the buds that do remain. ... :.■-..-, . MR. BLEVINS: Do you have any trouble with these outer ends winter-killing? A. No, our pruning has been done so late that this has been avoided. If you prune in early winter leave your canes slightly longer to take care of this possibility. Q. What time do you prune? ■ A. Usually about the 1st of April. MR. BEVINS: We start pruning about the middle of February, but we lose a few buds. A. You will, particularly if you cut close to the end bud, thus causing it to dry out; the remedy for that is to leave an extra bud on your cane. MR. MORRISON: Some people trim in the fall? A. The only damage here would come from drying out. If you want to lay your plants down and cover them up, prune them before this is done. Q. Dees pruning late in the spring injure your plants because of the bleeding? A. No, we have no information that bleeding injures the plants, at least I don't know of any. I have never seen anything that would indicate that it was particularly damaging to your plant. i- ■ \. MR.

            <seg id="p531">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY THE SOUR CHERRY INDUSTRY IN MICHIGAN AND WISCONSIN E. H. HOPPERT The sour cherry is the most widely grown and the most profitable fruit crop in northern Michigan and in the" Sturgeon Bay section of Wisconsin. Each of these regions boasts of about 5000 acres of cherries. A large proportion of this acreage has been put out within the last ten years and in the face of the fact that apples are a profitable crop in both sections and sweet cherries in the Michigan section. To be sure, sour cherries come into bearing three or four years earlier than do apples or sweet cherries. But even when both are in full bearing the sour cherry usually brings the greater profit. There are a number of reasons for this. The principal one is that the public wanted cherries badly enough to pay fancy prices for a good product. Even today canned scur cherries bring as high a price as any other canned fruit. Evidently its tartness tickles the public palate. In most sections, especially in the larger cities, home canning is a lost art. The house - wife is too busy with other things. Besides, if she did have the time, the fresh fruit is too high in price to warrant pitting and canning it. The reason for the high price is lack of local supplies. Years ago nearly every home orchard had a surplus of cherries and these were sold on the local market. Then, too, nearly every back yard had a few trees to supply home needs. But since shot-hole fungus has become so widespread, these two sources of supply have been practically eliminated. The owner of a few trees will not take the trouble to control this disease. As a result the trees lose their leaves, become weakened and finally die. Many cherry trees are killed before they have produced a single crop. Yet the desire for cherry pie and cherry sauce does not disappear. In fact it seems to grow under such conditions. Here then is the reason why the commercial growing of sour cherries has become so profitable. Shot-hole fungus can be controlled. The commercial growers are willing to take the necessary steps to do it and, of course, they get well paid for their trouble. The trend in Nebraska and adjoining states seems to be following in the same direction that it has farther east, so far as local supplies are concerned. Even though the climatic conditions in our state are . not as favorable for shot-hole as are the conditions in Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, etc., yet in the last few years we have seen some rather severe outbreaks and many trees have been killed by it. A number of foresighted fruit growers in the Nebraska City district have seen an opportunity to take advantage of this situation. Cherries of good quality can be grcwn in Nebraska and they are about as sure a fruit crop as we have. To date about 260 acres have been set out in eastern Otoe county. Thinking that we might profit by the experiences of the grow - ers in Wisconsin and Michigan, the State Horticultural Society author- </seg>
            <seg id="p532">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OK AGRICULTURE ized its secretary to make a trip into the cherry sections of those states and to make a report of his observations to the Society at its winter meetings. The occasion for the first part of the trip was a tour through the Michigan cherry regions arranged by the Michigan Horticultural So - ciety and to which the Wisconsin cherry growers were invited. The tour was to start at Frankfort, Michigan, on June 28th. About seventy - five Wisconsin fruit growers crossed Lake Michigan to take part in it. From Frankfort we drove through wooded hills to Beulah, which up until a few years ago was primarily a summer resort town, being situated on beautiful Crystal Lake. After driving along the shore of this pretty lake for two or three miles, we turned off into a gap between two heavily wooded hills and in about five minutes came within sight of Gus Rodgers' orchards. I had heard a great deal about Mr. Rogers. He had been an instructor in horticulture at Wisconsin University and at Michigan Agricultural College. About nineteen years ago he bought this piece of ground and planted five acres of cherries. Each year more trees were planted until in 1925 he had 115 acres in orchard. Mr. Rogers kept detailed cost accounts of the various blocks and production records' also. From these records a number of questions can be an - swered with facts and figures. For example, Mr. Rogers finds that the Montmorency is more profitable than Early Richmond, English Morello or any of the sweet or semi-sweet sorts. He also finds that his most profitable block is one that is spaced a rod apart both ways. ' He finds that pruning delays the bearing in the case of young trees and decreases the crop in old trees where overdone. While at the Michigan Agricul - tural College Mr. Rogers prepared a bulletin on cherry management. If any of you are particularly interested in cherry growing, send for "Special Bulletin No. 166, Studies in Orchard Management With Special Reference to the Cherry, by A. J. Rogers." Unfortunately for the visiting fruit growers, it started to drizzle just before we got to Beulah, so we did not spend much time out in the orchards. In fact we spent most of the morning in Mr. Rogers cherry packing shed asking him questions. One of the interesting. things that he has done is to ship fresh sweet cherries to Chicago by truck. He picks and packs this fruit in crates and loads his two trucks late in the afternoon. The next morning the cherries are on the market in Chicago, 350 miles away. The sweet cherries of the extra fancy grade, over an inch in diameter, are packed in special boxes and shipped out by parcel post. You will remember that I said this section was primarily a tour - ists' rendezvous. The tourists haye made this method a very important part of Mr. Rogers' marketing program. He sells several thousand pounds of extra fancy fruit now at an extra fancy price. </seg>
            <seg id="p533">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY After a dinner at the community club rooms in Benzonia, the crowd drove to Travers City over the new concrete highway. The road led mostly through virgin forest, but occasionally there were clearings and a few orchards, but mostly dairy farms. Near Travers City, however, we came to a highly developed orchard section. Here we found a section that had been growing sweet cherries and. apples, but the newer plant - ings consisted largely of sour cherries. The orchards were clean, not a weed in sight for the most part; The roads were graveled and paved and on each side lined with fruit trees for several miles north of the city. A few of the orchardists had their own canning plants. Many belonged to a cooperative that had its own cold storage and canning plant. Very few cherries are sold in the fresh state, most of them are canned, but quite a few are cold packed, that is, placed in barrels and frozen. The pie makers in the large cities prefer the frozen product to the canned. That night the entire group got together for a banquet, following which came some interesting talks. Mr. Kinnard of Sturgeon Bay told of his trip to England to sell Wisconsin cherries. London with thirteen million people offered a good market for Wisconsin cherries at a price comparable to that obtained in this country. Most of the growers were pleased to hear this joyful news, because there is a feeling that the acreage of cherries is increasing so rapidly that the American market will soon be overstocked. Mr. Ullsperger, the manager of the Sturgeon Bay Cooperative, called attention to the new acreage of cherries coming into bearing and warned the growers of the danger of becoming stam - peded into breaking the market. He advised cooperation in the best sense of the word to secure a fair price but warned against holding out for too high a price. He said that with these ideas in mind and an efficient marketing- organization to properly distribute the product, the industry would be on a sound stable basis. Professor Gardner of the Michigan Agricultural College talked on the future of the cherry in - dustry. It was his opinion that though there was a large increase in acreage the increase in production would probably not be in the same proportion. Winter-killing, leaf spot, poor orchard sites and lack of care would probably-make heavy inroads on the number of bearing trees. On the other hand, he felt that the consumption of cherries would see quite an increase as the product became better known and more widely distributed. Mr. Hootman, extension horticulturist and secretary of the Michi - gan Horticultural Society, told of some of the work done with the polli - nation of cherries, apples and pears. All of these fruits require bees for proper pollination. To prove this statement trees of various kinds were </seg>
            <seg id="p534">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE covered with screen to exclude pollinating insects; in each case the crop set was very light. He showed twigs of cherry trees from trees that had been under such a screen and one that had been exposed to the work of bees. The former had four or five cherries on it and the latter 220. The next day was spent - in the Hart section where we visited the Roach orchards. Here the visitors were shown some of the caged trees. The yield from a Montmorency tree under the cage turned out to be just fcur pounds at harvest time and the tree next to it where bees had been permitted to work, produced 144 pounds. Mr. Roach had that spring hired a beekeeper to bring into his 160 acres of cherries about 200 stands of bees at $2.50 each. That looks like quite an expense but unquestionably it paid big if the trees under the screens were an index of what would happen without bees. An interesting point was brought out in the control of shothole fungus in this orchard. There was a dis - tance difference between two blocks that were side by side. In the one very little infection occurred. In the other quite a lot of yellow leaves were noticeable. It was explained that the difference was that the one block had been finished on Saturday and the other had not been sprayed until the following Monday. Evidently the spores of the organism had gotten started into the leaves between Saturday and Monday morning. The damp muggy weather so common in Michigan is ideal for the spread of shot-hole but it can be controlled by proper spraying. We saw one orchard that had been dusted with sulphur dust ever since it was set out eight years before; shot-hole was not bad but the trees did not look quite as healthy as some other orchards of the same age we had seen elsewhere. Perhaps the trouble lay with the lack of fertility in this block. The custom with regard to spraying is to keep the foliage covered during the first part of the summer. Usually this means three applica - tions; Bordeaux is seldom used. It controls the shot-hole but stunts the leaves and the fruit. The Wisconsin delegation reported that they had tried the dusts' but felt that spraying gave a more lasting protection. They felt that it would take just twice as many applications to effective - ly control shot-hole with this, than where sprays were used. In order to cover the orchards quickly, large capacity outfits are used and the water supplied with special tank wagons so that a minimum of time would be lost in refilling the spray outfits. Some growers even went so far as to equip their outfits with searchlights so that the spraying could be done during the night. There is another phase of orcharding that must be attended to be - sides spraying and pollination, if the cherry orchards are to be consis - tent producers year after year and that is fertilization. According to </seg>
            <seg id="p535">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Mr. Rogers the only element of fertility that seems lacking is nitrogen and this is supplied in the form of sodium nitrate or ammonium sulphate. It is applied in the spring as the buds begin to swell, at the rate of three to five pounds per tree. But not all trees receive the same amounts. Trees that have made fourteen inches of terminal growth are passed up while those that have made only a few inches are given the full amount. Young. trees will not need fertilizers as a rule, where the soil is naturally quite fertile, but as they become older they respond very favorably, to fertilization. Mr. Rogers has been able to keep his old trees producing on an average about 16,000 pounds per acre after they reached twelve years of age. Where the trees are carrying an unusually heavy crop it may help to. produce a good crop the following year if about three pounds of nitrate or ammonium sulphate are applied just as the cherries turn red. We saw an orchard in the Travers City territory where the trees seemed to have more cherries than leaves. (By the way bees had been here used at blossoming' time.) Professor Gardner made this recommenda - tion. So much for the growing of cherries in Michigan. Another phase of the cherry industry which I was anxious to see was the harvesting and marketing of the crop. The season was about two weeks later than normal so we visited with friends and relatives in Wisconsin until the beginning of the harvesting season. On July 22nd a few days after the picking began we drove into Sturgeon Bay, the center of the cherry industry in Door county, Wisconsin. We called upon the manager of the cooperative, Mr. Herman Ullsperger, who directed us over the cherry route. Evidently there have been hundreds of visitors who have asked the same questions that we did, so the chamber of com - merce has had folders printed directing tourists and sightseers over a good gravelled and macadamized road which takes in nearly all of the important cherry orchards in the district. The operations were just beginning in earnest. Several thousand pickers were on the job and more were ccming. The harvesting of cherries requires a lot of help. The usual method of estimating the number needed is to multiply the producing acreage by two or two and one-half. If an orchard consists of forty acres of bearing trees, from forty to one-hundred pickers and helpers will be needed. Naturally- the required number of pickers can not be secured near by. Along in June the papers in the larger cities are carrying notices as to number of pickers required and the time when operations will begin. Those who are interested in earning a little money while enjoying at the same time a well supervised outing or vacation, are asked to send in their applications to the cooperative at Sturgeon Bay. The pickers must supply bed clothes and wearing apparel but everything else is furnished in the various camps. Most of the large orchards have their own camps. Some of these camps consist of tents, </seg>
            <seg id="p536">REPORT OK NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OK AGRICULTURE others of buildings. A Y. M: C. A. boys' camp at the fair grounds sup - plies pickers for the smaller growers. Each camp has its supei'visors and play directors. The large group is divided into small units each with captain who is a picking foreman in many cases. When the pickers arrive at a camp they are registered and given four metal buckets hold - ing about four quarts each. These are charged against their accounts and if the buckets are lost the cost is deducted from the picker's pay check. Meals are usually served in a central dining room and likewise charged against each picker, to be deducted from the pay check. Each picker carries a card and the checker to whom the cherries are delivered carries a duplicate. Whenever the picker fills two buckets he carries them to the checker who punches both tickets. The checker may be in a central shed in the orchard or he may be with the wagon that hauls the cherries to the canning company. Payment is made by the pound, the usual rate being three cents per pound where they are picked with stems attached or two cents where the cherries are stripped off. Sometimes a part of this pay is held back until all the cherries are harvested. This is a sort of a bonus to hold the pickers through the poor picking. Usually there is no difficulty about holding pickers when the crop is good but when there is a light crop the pickers leave in spite of all sorts of ruses to hold them to the end. As the picking season opens there is usually a small demand for fresh cherries for the larger markets. These cherries are picked with the stems attached. They are repacked in quart boxes -sixteen to the case. The cases are precooled before placing them in iced cars. It- is surprising how long they will hold up when treated in this manner. We saw one car that was billed to Iowa City and another that was being shipped to Aberdeen, South Dakota. The price per case of sixteen quarts usually ranges from $2.00 to $2.50 f. o. b. Sturgeon Bay. The demand for fresh cherries is decreasing according to those in a position to know, but the canned cherry market is on -the up grade. About 95 per cent of the crop is either canned or cold packed. The canning plant is a busy place during the harvest season. The process itself is rather simple in the modern plant. As the cherries ccme in from the orchards the crates are dumped into a water bath of fresh cold water. Warm water can't be used or even lukewarm water for it results in an inferior product. Cold water tends to keep the cherries crisp. Then the cherries are carried by conveyors to the sorting tables where girls sort out the poor cherries. Then they are carried on a wide belt to the pitting machine and placed in cans with a sugar solu - tion varying in strength with the demands of the market. Then the lids are crimped on and the closed cans are gradually heated and steamed until all foreign organisms are killed. The cans are then stacked </seg>
            <seg id="p537">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY and stored. As the product is sold the cans are labelled and packed in crates and shipped. The outstanding feature of the Sturgeon Bay cherry section is the splendid cooperation of the growers. Fully. 90 per cent of the cherry crop here is handled through the cooperative called the Fruit Growers Union. It has about 450 members. All of the larger growers but one belong and the grower operates his own plant. The cooperative, through such leaders as Herman Ullsperger and Mr. B. Goff, is functioning re - markably well in all possible ways. It provides pickers, cans and sells the product, buys supplies for its growers and will shortly be in position to provide credit to its members. The Fruit Growers Union owns a large canning factory at Sturgeon Bay, a cold packing and precooling plant cold storage, and two pitting and cold packing stations in the outlying districts. With this equipment sixty cars of cherries can be processed daily. Because of the tremendous output of this cooperative it serves to stabilize the entire cherry industry. But it is not acting independently of other regions.. The directors meet with the cherry growers of other regions to help keep the entire industry on a sound footing. As a result the growers have netted from six to eight cents per pound for their product. The entire cherry region is the picture of health and stability. The new acreage is causing some worry but new outlets are being sought thru advertising and visits by sales representa - tives to big buyers in this county and abroad. The industry is prosper - ous now and will undoubtedly be so for several years to come. Nebraska can well afford to watch the developments in Michigan and Wisconsin and profit by their experiences. Discussion QUESTIONS ANSWERED BY E. H. HOPPERT MR. GEO. MARSHALL: Which varieties are the most profitable? ■ A. The only accurate long time record of production, that I know of has been kept by Gus Rogers of Beulah, Mich. He has kept produc - tion records through a period of twenty years. He finds that the Montmoiency has outyielded the English Morello and the sweet varieties two to one, and his records also show that Montmorency outyielded early Richmond four to one. Unfortunately the block of Early Richmond that he used for comparison is situated in a very unfavorable location, so that it is not accurate. However, the experience of other growers in both Michigan and Wisconsin show that Montmorency is by far the most profitable sort to raise. From our experience here in Lincoln there is no such difference as that. In fact the English Morello type has given us the best production so far. Of course the trees in our tests here at Lincoln are fairly young. Whether the same results will be secured later on as the trees become older it is hard to say; but </seg>
            <seg id="p538">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE very likely not, since the late cherries are not making: the growth that the Early Richmond and Montmorency are. MR. MARSHALL: Wouldn't it be better to prolong the harvest season and canning season by planting the late cherries in our com - mercial plantings?. In this way the harvest equipment and organiza - tion could be used for a longer period. MR. HOPPERT: Perhaps so for Nebraska conditions. In the.Michi - gan and Wisconsin sections the growers don't think so. There is only a limited market for the late cherries. They would have to be sold in the fresh state because the canning companies don't can them. They will not can up as well as the earlier sorts. I am afraid we would have the same problem here. A small amount could probably be sold in the fresh state, but not very many. It seems best to grow only those varieties in large quantities that will sell well in the cans. MR. MARSHALL: I think you will find that the Early Richmond will do almost as well in Wisconsin as the Montmorency. I have never been there myself, but I have had reports from there to that effect. But I don't believe the Early Richmond do as well there as they do here. MR. O. STEVENSON: What distances do they recommend in plant - ing cherries? : ". MR. HOPPERT: Mr. Rogers has a record on this matter that it might be well to refer to. He has the comparison of yields with Mont - morency for a period of twenty years from blocks planted 16% feet each way, 16% x 20 and 23% x 23%. The closest distance has given the highest production per acre up to now. I was in the blocks from which the records were taken. It would seem to me that the trees planted a rod apart will not be able to keep up the lead much longer. The trees are now twenty-one years old and are so crowded that the lower branches are dying out. Picking and spraying are becoming more difficult. Per - haps a filler system would be ideal for us since our trees become quite large. (I saw one tree in Mr. Catron's orchard at Nebraska City that was thirty-nine or forty years old that was practically as large as most mature apple trees.) I know that the cherry orchards around Nebraska City have been planted mostly 20 x 20 and in Wisconsin this seems to be the system used in the newer plantings. Perhaps a system 20 x 16% would be more profitable for us. Then as the trees begin to. crowd the trees can be thinned to 20 x 33. This thinning out can be done gradually through a period of three or four years in the manner followed in the Washington apple district. THE PRESIDENT: Our next subject is "Pruning the Bearing Tree," by Professor R. H. Roberts, of Madison, Wisconsin.- </seg>
            <seg id="p539">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY PRUNING THE BEARING TREE PROFESSOR R. H. ROBERTS, MADISON, WISCONSIN Inspection of an older tree in the fruiting year, just before harvest time, shows that there is a great range in type of growth as regards length, foliage, set of fruit, and size and quality of fruit. That is, not all wood on a tree is of equal value for fruit production. It is believed to be the function of pruning to use it in an attempt to establish and maintain a tree with much bearing surface. Use cultivation and fer - tilizer to secure the amount of growth desired. Use pruning to secure a uniformity of wood type. In general, a tree which has much so-called run-out or poorly pro - ducing wood is of a tall narrow type. That is, a tree with a few very strong main branches and relatively weak lateral branches. Such a tree may be making a strong terminal growth on the main branches, but only a short growth on the laterals. This results in poor fruiting over much of the tree. I ■ On the other hand, the trees which a grower knows to be high yielding are generally of a lower, more spreading type. That is, they have several main branches of relatively equal size and grow equally on the ends. Such trees have much good bearing wood and are con - sequently producers of large yields. It is very clear, then, that the latter type of tree should be pro - duced, if possible. Trees of this form can be grown rather successfully. In the first place, when starting the young tree, do not use narrow - angled branches as main branches. Cut these off and save the wider angled branches even though they are smaller. The leader can be cut back proportionately and the proper "balance" maintained so the lower branches will develop into strong framework branches (Fig. 1). Fur - ther, do not permit more than two or three branches to arise close together. Where several branches arise near the same point, they more or less seriously choke out and check the growth of the leader. If two or three branches are started each year for three or four seasons and kept in reasonable balance, the result is a relatively low headed, spreading tree which is capable of maximum cropping. As most pruning, especially tipping, tends to delay bearing, as little pruning as possible should be done on the young tree. Usually, rather spreading trees of the variety will bear early. In cases where the tree is late in starting to bear either of two practical courses may be followed. It is not advisable -to girdle trees except as a last resort because of the danger of doing permanent damage. Late bearing trees </seg>
            <seg id="p540">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE may be thinned out shortly after growth starts in the spring. Pruning at this time, after the growing points are active, really opens up the tree without starting suckers, as may result from winter pruning. Being open through the early summer may result in enough light to cause blossom bud formation. Most young trees that are late in bear - ing are too dense and shaded. A second method may be used to induce bearing. A few of the branches may be bent over and tied down a little after growth starts. This puts these branches out in the light and at the same time admits more light to the untied branches. Tying all the branches may result in suckering and a complete defeat of the desire to force bearing. Shortly after a tree starts to bear well, some of the smaller branches in many varieties become weak and "run-out." The result is a larger percentage of cull apples. It is a common experience for record crops to be borne on relatively young orchards. This is the period when there is a maximum of good bearing surface on an acre. Use pruning to keep the tree young. The responses from cutting are mostly rather close to where the cut is made. This means that large cuts should be avoided and that the cut should be made where rejuvenation is desired. Take out or cut back the small branch that is not fruiting well. If a small branch arises from a large one, it is commonly dwarfed instead of rejuvenated by cutting. Test the job of pruning by looking at the prunings; the poorly fruiting wood should be on the ground and the good wood on the tree. Some people say not to prune. This is true if the tree is not benefited by pruning. If you would know how to prune, look at the trees. See what kinds of branches and trees bear well. Use the cultural methods and pruning to make the trees and branches grow like the type that fruit best. THE PRESIDENT: Our next subject is "What Can Be Done About the Cedar Rust?" — a round table discussion. THE PRESIDENT: I will ask Mr. Banning to open the discussion. MR. BANNING: Mr. President, I think the apple growers in east - ern Nebraska need no information as to what the Cedar Rust did to them in the past year. This disease damaged the trees and crops not only in 1928, but we will see results of it in 1929 in decreased vigor and production. We have a good many cedar trees in eastern Nebraska planted in the early days. Our early settlers were anxious for some - thing in the way of evergreens for windbreaks and ornamental purposes, </seg>
            <seg id="p541">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY so they went to the river and dug up native cedars and brought them home to plant them. I think all the orchard men fully realize that something must be done if we are going to continue with our orchards. Our Jonathans, Wealthy and Missouri Pippins were brown nearly all summer long as though a fire had singed "the leaves and killed them. Cedar rust was to blame for this condition and nothing else. Most all of you heard the discussion this morning concerning the importance of the leaves in relation to growth and fruit produclion. Without a doubt the Jonathan crop will be short next year where the leaves were badly infected. Now, two years ago we thought we had some legislation passed that would remedy the situation, but the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture seems to think that he doesn't have enough power to go in and destroy these cedar trees. It has been suggested that if we can't do anything else we better catch a few sacks of these cedar bag - worms and slip them in those trees — I don't think we want to resort .to anything of that kind. Mr. McLaughlin wants something more definite in the way of legislation for controlling cedar rust. He does not want it to affect cedars where there are no commercial orchards. Our great trouble is to get the owners of cedar trees to understand and appreciate the fact that the cedars do this damage; I have had fellows argue with, me that there was nothing to it. In my locality I have argued with a few fellows who dispute that, so I took the time the other day at the Agricultural College to find out what other states think about the matter and what has been done to control cedar rust. AH of you know there is no spray that you can control it with. About the best, proposition I found was the law they have in Virginia. This Virginia law has been, through the courts and was carried to the Supreme Court and decided there as valid. Our conditions are a little different from those in other states, but I think the Virginia law covers the matter fairly well for us. It makes it unlawful to keep cedar trees within two miles of an apple orchard; and it goes on and sets up a method of inspection. This law calls for ten signers; I don't think ten are necessary — I think if there were five that signed the complaint it would be satisfactory. It puts the enforcement of irradication in charge of the State Entomologist and gives him police power. It also has a provision for the treatment of ornamental trees — I wouldn't recommend any treatment but the axe if I had my way. That Virginia law says that.uiftder this method of treatment there is no way to treat them only to clip the cedar apples off. I imagine the owners of ornamental cedars won't do that. In this Virginia. bill it provides for serving notice and if the party fails to comply with the notice to destroy the trees, the </seg>
            <seg id="p542">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE entomologist has the right to destroy them, and the party is also sub - ject to a fine for not complying with the notice or order; he has IB days to appeal to the district court in Virginia, if he feels he is damaged; if he makes the appeal and the court decides he is damaged he is paid by an order on the county treasurer, and the orchards in that locality are assessed not to exceed $1.50 an acre for reimbursing the county. I would be willing to give that if I could get rid of these cedar trees within two miles of my orchard. In some cases I have encouraged some to chop them down, and one fellow agreed that I might chop them out of there if I would give him some fair sized pine trees to take their place. The New York law is not quite explicit enough; I think the Vir - ginia law is as near workable as any I have been able to find. I will admit it is quite a problem to go around to some' of these homes and ask that these cedar trees be destroyed; I think they would be pretty apt to yell about it, but it is a case at the present time, that we must have something done with these cedar trees or give us some other varieties of apples in eastern Nebraska. Some of you have put out orchards and brought them up to bearing; it takes quite a little nerve to go into that work, and it is no small expense; it is practically a ten-year proposition to get an orchard up to the bearing point; it takes considerable time, expense and labor to do it. There is a great deal of money invested in Jonathans in eastern Nebraska that is not done in any other part of the state and orcharding will develop if given the proper attention. There is no doubt in my mind but that along the Missouri River apple growing is becoming an important industry, there has been quite an increase in these last few years, but we can't raise orchards and cedar trees in the same vicinity. In Virginia and some eastern states they are operating under a' law that is absolutely de - stroying and taking out the cedar trees. I don't know whether this department is putting out any cedar trees with their allotments of forest seedlings or not — (Interrupted). MR. WIGGANS: I think Mr. Watson sent out some in this year's distribution, but he has limited this distribution to the western part of the state where cedars are exceedingly valuable because of their hardi - ness and where apple growing is not on a commercial basis. MR. McCOMB: I favor growing them in the western part of the state; our orchards in the western part of the state amount to nothing more than two or three trees bearing for summer sauces. MR. BANNING: This law would not apply unless there was some complaint made by the owner of BOO or more apple trees. MR. PORTER: Kansas has a law that seems to be very effective. Around Nebraska City this last year there were a lot of trees that were </seg>
            <seg id="p543">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY practically defoliated and I really believe about two years like this last year would ruin the trees for a long time. We don't have enough cedar trees raised to warrant any drastic measures. It seems like the last three years particularly it has been worse eyery year. We have taken out a number of cedar trees this winter. We have explained the con - dition to the people and they have let us take the trees out. Of course, there are places where they balk on us. You need the law now, but really I thought the way the law stands now if the Secretary of Agri - culture wanted to he could declare the cedar trees a nuisance and get hy with it; they are just as much of a nuisance to the fruit men as the ■common barberry is to the wheat people. When I had charge of Arbor Lodge the common barberry was still used for an ornamental plant The first time barberry inspectors came we told them we didn't think we had to take them out and about the third time they came around they said they would declare it a nuisance and compel us by law to destroy the plants. So I think the cedar tree can be declared a nuisance. If this new law is put into effect you won't have to pass the buck to the Secretary of Agriculture. I don't think there is any doubt but what he can declare the cedar a nuisance, but these men in public office don't like to step on anyone's toes. If we are going to set up a commercial apple business in southeastern Nebraska we must get rid of the cedars. MR. BANNING: I think we ought to have a committee appointed. MR PORTER: Can you get a copy of the Kansas law? MR. BANNING: Yes, sir. MR. PORTER: The way this has worked out, we have a law, but it hasn't been enforced — it hasn't been satisfactory. With us it has been more a matter of education. ■ I don't know just how would be the best way to handle it, but if we got all the' laws together along with the law enforcement agencies I think we could work it out. THE PRESIDENT: I think we have a committee on that now which has not been discharged. I think Mr. George Marshall, J. F. Shubert, Mr. Banning, A. J. Weaver and E. H. Hoppert are the committee. Q. What is the number in the Virginia law to sign the complaint ? A. They say ten freeholders to sign, but I think that is too many. Q. How long has that Virginia law been in effect? A.I don't know; it was tested in the courts and in 1914 it was approved, and was amended March 16, 1920. MR. MARSHALL: It was again amended in 1924 relative to reim - bursing by a levy on the apple growers. </seg>
            <seg id="p544">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE MR. BANNING: This reads that whenever the court orders any damage to be paid out of the general fund and the county treasurer makes any payment under Section 889, the county shall be reimbursed not exceeding $1.50 on all apple orchards planted ten years and 50 cents for those planted not more than two years in each district. MR. YATES: I want to ask if you have any record showing any experiments that have been made thoroughly and completely in the line of spraying cedar trees in order to prevent the spores from the apple going over to the cedar trees? THE PRESIDENT: I think not.' MR. HOPPERT: I think under Professor Wilcox some experiments were carried on in this connection, but they couldn't find anything that would keep the spores from being disseminated. The trouble is that after every wet spell in the spring a new crop of spores are liberated from the cedar galls. I think the Shuberts did some of that spraying with a concentrated copper sulphate solution; I know Grove tried last year to control it by dusting with sulphur dust, but neither method was successful. MR. PORTER: Why bring that up? MR. BANNING: My question was, have you made any experiments spraying cedar trees to prevent the spores from the apple trees going back to the cedar trees? MR. HOPPERT: We haven't tried that. MR. BANNING: I would like to see that tried; I have had some experience in that line. I sent Professor Heald some of the samples and I asked him this question one time when he was at our place for supper a good many years ago, and I asked him why they didn't destroy the spores before they leave the cedar tree so it couldn't attack the apple tree and he said it couldn't be done. MR. HOPPERT: I suppose you are thinking it might be done the other way around. MR. BANNING: That is the way I raised the question. MR. HOPPERT; That would be impracticable because the apple trees that carry the infection back to the cedars are scattered every - where in the towns and cities as well as in the country. MR. PORTER: I move that the society go on record as approving Mr. Banning's efforts and authorizing the committee to help carry out the suggestions made. I don't know just how to word that, but our secretary can fix it up. </seg>
            <seg id="p545">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY MR. BAKER: I second that. MR. HOPPERT: We have Mr. Gates and Mr. Swenk here. Let's hear from them. THE PRESIDENT: Let's hear from you, Mr. Gates. MR- GATES: I don't imagine that I can add anything to what Mr. Banning has told you. I have talked it over with him and the Virginia law seems to be the outstanding law' of the country. I understand you have suggested going ahead and trying to get it made a law and I be - lieve that is the best thing to do. MR. SWENK: I have not heard the discussion and I don't know what I might say in addition to what has already been said. I am fairly conversant with the present law, and I think an interpretation of its provisions would take care of this situation, but I see no objection to passing a law somewhat more specific if that is desired, it might con - fine responsibility, possibly a much better law might be worked out. Do you feel the present law is inadequate, Senator? MR. BANNING: Mr. McLaughlin doesn't think it is very good. We have another decision on this Virginia: law, it has been to the Supreme Court and decided favorably. I am frank to state, however, that this Virginia law turns a little of the work over to the state entomologist and gives him police powers to enforce it. . MR. SWENK: The Nebraska law put this power into the hands of the state entomologist, but he doesn't have it any more; he is completely divorced from it now. MR. BANNING: We thought a few years ago we had it air tight. Mr. McLaughlin doesn't say it isn't, but he thinks we ought to have a little more definite action about it; he doesn't like the idea of going into a man's yard to destroy his cedar trees. I suppose he thinks it might bring a little grief on him in some cases. THE PRESIDENT: It seems to me if our present law is sufficient it might be better to let well enough alone and leave it as it is and bring a little pressure to bear upon Secretary McLaughlin. MR. PORTER: If we are ever going to get a law passed in our favor this is the time to do it. The Governor, I think, is favorable, and if we are going to try to get a law passed now is the time to do it. Mr. McLaughlin hasn't changed his feeling for two years and really he is getting a little further away. ■ I think Mr. Gates was down last summer and went over the situation very thoroughly. The cedar trees will have to be cut out or we will have to get out of the apple business. </seg>
            <seg id="p546">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE MR. MARSHALL: Do you suggest a separate bill? MR. PORTER: I am leaving that to Senator Banning. MR. BANNING: The bill several years ago carried several things. It doesn't name cedar trees, it names any pest, where in this Virginia law it is explicit legislation for that one thing only. MR. CHET MARSHALL: I might say just a word. Most of us when we speak of cedars, think of the red cedar that we are using for windbreaks more or less and planting them in our yards, the - Platte River type of red cedar. As we go into the cities like Omaha and Lin - coln we find numerous varieties, forms and kinds of Juniper or cedar being planted for ornamental purposes. I imagine that in preparing, a bill following out this Virginia idea that possibly you ought to consider that phase of it a little. MR. BANNING: The bill does that in the first section. MR. MARSHALL: I think you will find lots of opposition to the-, bill, but I believe it is right that if a man in the city has a good home and wants to put in ornamental trees he should see to it that the cedar apples are picked off. MR. MARSHALL: Practically all of these Junipers will produce cedar rust if you let them. Suppose you are growing one, if you would pick every one of those cedar apples off, it couldn't affect the apple trees. I think it would be all right with a provision of that kind that would differentiate and specify so there would be no opposition. MR. BAKER: I move that this Society go on record as in favor of some bill to abolish the cedar trees and the committee now standing have the power to select the proper bill and try for its passage at this session of the legislature. MR. PORTER: I will withdraw my motion and second this one. THE PRESIDENT: I would like to have you include in that motion that I wish to appoint Chet Marshall in place- of George Marshall on that committee as Mr. George Marshall will be out of the state. MR. BAKER: I agree to that. MR. SWENK: I have just been handed a copy of the .Virginia law which I had not seen before. I notice a paragraph here that places quite a bit of emphasis on the feasibility of the treatment of ornamental trees prior to the use of more drastic measures. I see that Doctor Goss is here and I think it would be quite appropriate to have a word' from him as to the possible benefit that might be secured from the treatment of cedar trees to prevent cedar rust. </seg>
            <seg id="p547">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY DOCTOR GOSS: I think there is nothing I can add. MR. SWENK: One more thought. This committee ought to take care and see that the bill is rendered scientifically as -well as legally sound. THE PRESIDENT: I think that is a good suggestion. . The motion was put and declared carried unanimously. MR. HOPPERT: Before we adjourn I wish to present a brief re - port on the Horticultural Science Meeting at New York. THE HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE MEETINGS AT NEW YORK By E. H. HOPPERT, Secretary Nebraska: State Horticultural Society Investigators along horticultural lines met at Columbia University on December 27, 28 and 29, to tell of their experiences. The secretary of the Nebraska Horticultural Society was authorized to attend these meetings by the executive board and was in turn asked to report thereon to the Society at its annual meetings. In preparing this report I have selected only those papers which dealt with the fruits which we grow in Nebraska. I will give the title of the paper and a brief resume of the principal points made by the author. "The Relation of Leaf Area to Size and Quality in Delicious Apples," by J. R. Magness of Pullman, Washington. The author thinned the apples on branches of the Delicious variety in such a manner that for each apple on the limb there were ten leaves. Another limb had twenty leaves per apple, another thirty leaves per apple, and still another fifty leaves per apple. The fruit at harvest time was compared for size, quality and color. Those apples that had only ten to twenty leaves each were small in size, poor colored and poor, in quality. With thirty leaves each they were fair, but much better when there were forty to fifty leaves for each apple. Under similar conditions the Winesap gave the same results, but in the case of Jonathan better fruit was secured with twenty-five to thirty leaves per apple than where they had either a greater or a smaller number. With Jonathan, where the greater number of leaves were present the apples were coarse and where the smaller number was present the apples were too small and were more pcorly colored and of poor quality. In making the practical application of these results, Mr. Magness is advising that apples be thinned according to these results, namely, that more Jonathans be left than Delicious and Winesap and that the </seg>
            <seg id="p548">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE thinning be done, not by a hard and fast rule of distance between fruits, but rather according to the number and size of the leaves. Mr. Magness also gave a paper entitled "Observations on Color Development in Apples." 'By placing apples under ordinary glass in sunlight and comparing the color with apples from the same branches but in direct sunlight, it was found that in 12 days the latter had 96 per cent of color, whereas those under glass had only 44 per cent color. Delicious and Winesap responded in the same way. Another factor that enters into color development is the sugar content. As the apple begins to ripen its starch is changed to sugar and then coloring begins. Any - thing that tends to prevent sugar formation will tend to prevent color formation. A striking example of this is a limb or tree that has a very heavy crop. Here, even though the fruit is more exposed to sun - light, the coloring is not as good as on a tree having a heavier foliage and where normal sugar development takes ' place. A common notion is that cool nights and heavy dews followed by bright days promote coloring. That cool nights have little to do with color we can see from summer varieties like Red Astrachan and Wilson Red June. The forma - tion of dew, on the other hand, clears the air of dust particles, per - mitting a greater amount of ultra violet light to reach the fruit. Medical science is using artificial ultra violet rays for the treatment of certain ailments. Lights of this kind were tried on apples, but it was found that the rays were too powerful to get good results, by continuous ex - posure. If the apples were treated an hour a day for several days good color was secured. - . W. Paddock of Ohio in his paper on "The Influence of Shade Upon Fruit Bud Differentiation," told of his experiments to determine when fruit buds were formed. It was the general belief that this took place in June, July, and August. But the actual beginning is made by the tree in the two weeks after the .trees are in full bloom. He showed this by covering the limbs of old trees with tents at various times. The tree that was covered at the time the trees were in bloom produced no fruit buds, but those covered after that period produced fruit buds. The Delicious in the middle west and east is rather a shy bearer. F. S. Howlett of Wooster, Ohio, tried to find the reason for this strange behavior. He found that the heaviest drop occurred immediately after blossoming. Seldom do more than 15 per cent of the Delicious flowers set fruit. Usually it is the central flower that sets. Very seldom do any of the lateral flowers set when the central one does. Heavy appli - cations of nitrate fertilizers do not seem to help any. Severe thinning out of the central portion of the tree shows promise of being beneficial. Evidently the female parts of the flower are weaker than in the case of Jonathan and Winesap. Stayman and Black Twig are very similar </seg>
            <seg id="p549">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY to Delicious in this respect. He recommends that special thought be given to pollination of Delicious and Staymen with such varieties as Jonathan and keeping the trees in vigorous growing condition. A problem that has been bothering horticulturalists for years is the alternating bearing habit of some varieties like Duchess, Wealthy, etc. J; S. Bailey of Amherst, Mass., told of an experiment he tried to change this habit by taking off various percentages of the bloom. Trees that had this habit were deprived of 50, 75 and 100 per cent of their bloom. He found that only when all the blooms were taken off did the habit change and then it simply changed the off year. He did not try taking off 90 or 95 per cent of the bloom. Perhaps he might have had some success with this method. He is going to try it at any rate. Thinning the fruit has had no effect in regulating the bearing habit and the reason is. that fruit bud differentiation takes place before the fruit is usually thinned. W. C. Dutton of Michigan Agricultural College read a paper on "The Immediate and Residual Effects of Spray Materials on the Yield," and a method of modifying lime-sulphur to reduce foliage injury. He told of a number of instances where excessive spraying had caused a dwarfing of the leaves that same year with a resultant dwarfing of the fruit. In some cases an excessive drop resulted also. Together with this harmful effect that same year came a decrease in the number of fruit buds formed. Where heavy lime-sulphur applications must be made he advised the use of one-half pound of ferrous sulphate to each gallon of lime-sulphur. Late in the season the ferrous sulphate has a tendency to stain the fruit, but Bordeaux could be substituted at this time. The matter of codling moth control was taken up in the meeting of the entomologists on Friday afternoon. This problem is being attacked from many different angles. In California, W. B. Herms is trying to find out what effect artificial light will have on the egg - laying habits of the codling moth. He has equipped an orchard with large lamps with which he produces sufficient light to partially imitate conditions during the day. The moths seem to lay fewer eggs than normal, but controlling the insect with this method is not practical at present. Chemically treated bands are receiving quite a little attention. Entomologists from Colorado and Ohio reported on these methods. As yet nothing has fleen found that can be recommended, though there is a somewhat promising outlook along this line. T. J. Headlee of New Brunswick, New Jersey, reported an experi - ment that he tried as a method supplementary to spraying. First he (17) </seg>
            <seg id="p550">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE enclosed various parts of the tree in tents to determine where the codling moth over-wintered. He found that 91 per cent lived over on the part of the tree where rough bark was present, that is, on the trunk and main branches. About 9 per cent lived over in the smaller branches. None lived over in* the soil. Then he sprayed the trunks and main branches with a 50 per cent solution of paranitrochlorobenzene or pineol and found that every larva was killed by this material. Equal parts of water and pineol were used. The cost of materials would be about 5 to 7 cents per tree. This material is at present on the market, costing from 40 to 50 cents per gallon. So far as could be determined to date, no injurious effects could be noted on the trees upon which this material had been used. THE PRESIDENT: We will now stand adjourned until 9:00 o'clock tomorrow morning. THURSDAY MORNING SESSION January 10, 1029 The final session was called to order by the &lt; secretary at 9:00 o'clock. THE SECRETARY: We tried to get Mrs. Fisher from the Henry Field Seed &amp; Nursery Company to appear on our program this morning. She said she would be here if she didn't go to California. She. an - nounced the other night over the radio that she was coming. I hope she does, but if she does not come we will have to get along without her. Because of that uncertainty we had better make a little switch in our printed program. Mrs. Nellie Long of Holdrege is here and we will now hear from her about her experiences in the vicinity of Hol - drege, and if Mrs. Fisher does not come we will have Professor Swerik tell us about "Plant Leaf Scale." We will hear Mrs. Long first. CHOOSING PERENNIALS FOR THE HOME GARDEN MRS. NELLIE LONG, Holdrege, Nebraska Perhaps I can best talk to you about shrubs, perennials and trees by telling of the work done on my own grounds, not because it is so well done, but because I am familiar with it. Perhaps, too, some of you will be interested in the fact that one can raise a lot of fine things on the prairies of central Nebraska such as we have in the vicinity of Holdrege. It will be thirty-six years in March since I came to Nebraska and during that time I have always tried to have a few flowers. A visit to </seg>
            <seg id="p551">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY a very beautiful garden late in the spring- of 1923 gave me the inspira - tion for the work I have been doing since, just a little bit at a time, however. Later an article in a floral magazine compared garden work with the painting of a- picture with the lawn for the canvas, the shrubs and trees for the background, etc. It would have been a strain on anyone's imagination to have visual - ized a garden picture on such an unpromising location as I had. My lawn, 90 x 120 feet was fenced with ordinary woven wire. I had failed to get a stand of grass on the south side where I began the planting; most of the black dirt which had been spread over the clay had blown or washed away. A very few plants and shrubs were established about the yard at this time, a Persian lilac in one corner, a spirea and two clumps of roses south of the porch and three hydrangeas (P. G.) east of the porch. These were all that I had at the start. That spring I bought twelve Spirea Van Houttii of the smallest size. My good genius must have been at my elbow when I planted those tiny shrubs thirty inches from the foundation. Not a green leaf did they show until everything else was in full foliage, but nine of them grew. I sent for some perennial seeds and made a crude cold frame of four six-inch boards with a discarded window screen frame covered with muslin for a top. On the 28th of June I planted the seed, covered lightly with soil, then spread a piece of damp burlap over the rows. This is not the best time to plant seeds, with the hot summer weather just around- the corner, but the tiny plants soon began to come through. Not all germinated at the same time, so the large piece of burlap was removed and strips put over the rows that were not yet up. In the fall I had a fine collection of hardy plants. They were carried over winter in the frames. That fall I had a neighbor lad dig up a small plot for a collection of tulips. I smile when I think of the tiny bed. I wondered if I could ever get flowers enough to fill it. The next spring the perennials grown from seed were put in their permanent location. I remember in par - ticular one instance of the saving made. A twenty-five-cent package of Mrs. Scott Elliott's long spurred hybrid columbines produced plants that would have cost at least $9 if bought from the nursery. An. interesting experience was ours in the making of our lawn. It is difficult to seed a lawn in our section, especially in the spring, so whenever we came to a bit of grass we dug it up and set it out on the lawn. You see we had to make our canvass as we went along. In this way we got a smooth even turf where seeding had failed. It looked a bit spotty at first, but we have never failed in the fall to get grass to grow when transplanted. </seg>
            <seg id="p552">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE More spireas were bought and the foundation planting completed. A better cold frame was built and more perennial seeds planted. Branches of Persian lilac were laid down and covered with dirt to make new plants for my background. That year clematis paniculate vines were planted near the fence; also two Dr. Van Fleet roses, one for each side of the dining-room window. I intended to train them on trellises, and hoped to break the long line of the house on that, side. The day I sent the order I had the holes dug two feet deep and four feet from the foundation. The spring was very dry that year so I ran water into those holes as long as it would soak away. When the roses came the soil was ready for them. Like Gene Stratton Porter, I prayed a little prayer to the god of green growing things that they might grow, but I never forgot that while God would send the rain and sunshine and the dew, mine were the hands to care for them. I don't want to weary you with all the details of the building of my garden. The program in fact was much the same each succeeding year. Each year I planted a few more shrubs and grew some more perennials from seed until by 1927 I had used all the ground I could take east and south of the house. I had to keep a little sweep of lawn at the front and side to give the appearance of distance, and in the southwest corner I wanted to put out some trees. Now, in all human probability, I will never live to sit in the shade of those trees, but no one can take from me the pleasure I get in seeing them grow. Then I think of that beautiful quotation, "He that planteth a tree is a servant of God. He provideth a kindness for many genera - tions, and faces he hath not. seen shall bless him." The neighbor who farms my land said he would prepare the ground and set out the trees, so the largest project yet was started. The space used is twenty-two feet wide on the west and sixty feet long on the north. On the south side next the lawn we used the garden hose to get the outline of broad shallow curves that we wanted, gradually narrowing the width until at the upper end it is four feet wide. The ground slopes and is a little lower in this corner, so I used three Rotha Magensis lilacs, a taller growing kind than the Persian lilac, in the corner, and an Exochorda and ten Spirea Van Houttii. A Cornus Siverica, a honeysuckle and three Virginal syringas are also in this planting. There are three types of soil in this project; at the west end good black soil, further on yellow clay; at the east end red clay that came from thirty-five feet under ground. You see we used all the dirt excavated when we built the house to fill in the yard. Where the clay seemed stiff I worked in a little sifted coal ashes. Shrubs and plants seem to grow equally well in all three types. </seg>
            <seg id="p553">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY :"'■■■■. . I now had over 300 feet of border from three to twenty-two feet wide. It sounds like a project requiring tremendous effort, but remem - ber °it was done just a little at a time. The shrubs were all of small size for, with the exception of the barberry hedge that I will speak of later, I put them out myself. They cost less, recover more quickly from the shock of transplanting 1 , and soon grow into large shrubs. I prefer putting them. out as early as the ground can be worked, cutting them back within a few inches of the ground and banking dirt over the top until growth starts. Many perennials are needed to fill so large an area. I like to grow many of them from seed, using the same method I did in the beginning, but planting earlier — usually the first part of May. Most of these are left in the frame over winter. Some of the strongest growing may be put in their permanent location in the fall and the very early blooming varieties should be. If I buy perennials or am making strong divisions of my own plants, I set those out early, just as growth is starting. For the seedlings in the frames I wait until the weather is more settled, and have put them out as late as June with fine success. We have high, drying winds that makes growing fine seeds in the open ground next to impossible. Even if we could, the work of weeding the tiny plants overbalances the work of transplanting. The peonies, iris and hardy phlox are bought. The list of desirable perennials grown from seed and proving hardy under ordinary condi - tions is as follows: Achillea, Alyssum Saxatile, Asclepia Tuberosa or Butterfly Weed, Butterfly Bush, Columbine, Canterbury Bell, Campanula Persicifolia (true perennial), Carnations, Delphinium, Dicentra Eximea, Early Shasta Daisy, Late Shasta Daisy, Covent Garden Market, Ox Eye Daisy, Gypsophila, Helianthemum, Hibiscus, Heuchera, Iberis, Linum, Oriental Poppy, Platycodon, Penstemon, Physostegia, Lillium Temi - folium or Coral Lily of Siberia, Salvia Azurea, Statice Latifolia, Scabiosa Caucasica, Tritoma, Thalictrum Depterocarpum, Tunica Saxifraga, Ver - bascum. Most of these come through the winter without protection other than the summer's growth of foliage that I leave on until spring. But - terfly Bush must be protected the same as hybrid tea roses. Thalictrum I bank a little dirt over, and Tritoma is wintered in the basement. For the small seedlings put out in the fall I turn a flat fruit crate over to protect from wind and sun. The trees I have had put out in 1927 are American Elm, Black Locust, Russian Olive and Chinese Elm. They were doing so well when we had a disastrous hail storm the 26th of May. You all know what that does to trees or vegetation. As soon as the ground was dry enough I got out, cut off the bruised and broken portions of trees and plants, cultivated the ground and by August the yard was a blaze of bloom and you could not tell there had been a hail storm, as far as the flowers were concerned — but not so with the trees. </seg>
            <seg id="p554">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE They were terribly cut and bruised. One Chinese Elm had a gash three inches long and bark loosened half way around the stems. Neverthe - less, the Chinese Elms made the quickest and best recovery and by fall were healed over. You all remember the warm weather of last March, then the terrible freeze of April 6 and 7. The buds on the Russian Olives and Chinese Elms were showing color. Four of the Russian Olives died to the ground and branches on others died. I waited until sure they were dead, then cut to the ground. Three sent up strong shoots that will make trees. The Chinese Elms stood still until warmer weather when they leafed out, apparently unhurt. This does not prove conclusively that the Chinese Elm is the tree for our locality, but it is a point in their favor. Out cf 100 Caraganas ninety-eight are living. I gave the neighbor who did the work full credit that these trees are doing well. He is putting out many trees and shrubs on his own place and making them grow, too. Our great trouble is insufficient rainfall. He levels every bit of ground even if he has to plough and scrape, then plough again, to retain all the rain that falls. My shrubs are watered. There is no stock en the place so I can have all the water from ' the windmill. I have a three-inch eighteen-foot pipe connected to the tubing. This is connected with three-fcurth-inch pipe that carries it to the yard and gives plenty of pressure. You will note that I grow only the things that I can reasonably expect to do well in our soil under our climatic conditions. I don't try to grow a California garden in Nebraska. Neither do I try to grow Here is a picture of what Mrs. Lone accomplished in, three years. </seg>
            <seg id="p555">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY the shrubs that require acid soil. It can be and is done in a' garden I know, but requires repeated applications of a chemical to keep the soil acid. I do try new things, but I do not buy so much as a package of seed without first learning all I can about it, and then only of plants that grow in the same latitude as we are. In 1927 I got three Hy - pericum Henryi plants that so far have done well. I have tried to combine the practical and beautiful, and so far am content with results. The first row of lilacs prevent a snow drift in front of the garage. The bird 'bath that cost 50 cents attracts and gives aid and comfort to the birds that are of untold value in keeping insect pests under control. Our blizzards come from the north and northwest and a drift blockaded my back gate. The northwest planting not only holds that drift, but has the extra moisture for spring growth. Work - ing with nature you- see. The barberry hedge at the front protects the shrubbery and plants that need semi-shade. This hedge is contrary to the rules of landscaping, but is not quite so bad as it sounds. There is more than fifty feet of open lawn in front of it and the cement walk from the front door goes to the driveway at the south. It starts at the northeast corner of the porch, comes out in a semi-circle, then down in line with the walk. When we finished putting it out the neighbor lad who helped me looked at it and said, "Why, it's a question mark; I s'pose it means, what next?" For several years I have had many visitors to see the choice gladi - olus that I grew. Now visitors come from the first growth in the spring to the last flower in the fall — any day in the week — any hour in the day. I'll confess it is sometimes a tax on my time and strength to be maid of all work, gardener and hostess all in one. ' Comments and questions are many; I am always glad to tell anyone what I do and why. People say, "A woman with a family and carrying on the regular work of the farm can't do this work." I very frankly say, No, not so much of it, but it's a fine family project. I can't think of anything finer for dad and mother and the children than beautifying their home. "What does it cost?" comes next. I keep careful book accounts and averaging the cost from 1923 to 1928, inclusive, I find the cost has been $17 per year. I can't tell the exact labor cost, for when I had help there was other work done, but I know I am safe in saying $5 per year would have covered it. That includes the cost of trees, plants, shrubs and seed. I believe the most critical person would have to admit it has added that much value to the farm. Best of all, I've regained my health. Now, I have not given you my garden practices because I think they are the best, for often they are makeshifts to fit my strength. I will pass on two rules that I always use and will guarantee to be 100 per cent efficient. First, be prepared. Don't order plants and wait until </seg>

It is so human to blame the seedsman or the nurseryman for our failures. By the time we have checked up on our own mistakes we know better what to do next time and leave that snappy letter unwritten. The question mark still grows and silently says, "What next?" Only time can tell that. I hope I can at least keep the trees, shrubs and flowers growing: into still greater beauty to interest and encourage other farm people to beautify their homes. THE PRESIDENT: If Mrs. Fisher of the Henry Field Seed and Nursery Company is in the room we will now hear from her. I presume she will tell you something more about the growing of perennials. But whatever she has prepared to talk upon, I am sure will be exceedingly interesting if one can judge by the splendid radio talks she makes. { It is an honor and a pleasure to introduce Mrs. Fisher of the Henry Field Seed and Nursery Company, Shenandcah, Iowa. PERENNIALS i MRS. FISHER, Shenandoah, Iowa There is only one way that I can greet friends and that is to say, How do you do. Since my topic is perennials .1 think I might as well stop before beginning, after hearing Mrs. Long, in fact some of the things I was going to tell you very solemnly that you couldn't raise in Nebraska, she told you you could, and I began to wonder if my paper would be au - thentic at all. It may be there are a few that I know about that she has not tried; we shall hope so, anyhow. 9 In this swift moving generation there is nothing that has changed more rapidly than our attitude toward hardy perennials. Even people who were the flower "fans" twenty-five years ago considered del - phiniums and gaillardias rare plants and felt their border complete if it had both "white" and "blue" iris. A whole township would drive out of its way to look at an R. P. Struthers phlox and the ownership of an Oriental poppy placed one among the aristocracy. Then Dreer's catalogue crept into the west and we found ourselves trying to grow Japanese anemones, hardy primroses, violas and many other plants unsuited to our climate, which I consider the most trying in, the world for perennials. We discovered that if we wished to keep our borders lovely with bloom at all seasons we had better stick to the standbys and do our experimenting in the vegetable garden. </seg>
            <seg id="p557">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Did you start a' seed bed for perennials in July and see it burn up in early August? After that experiment we most of us decided that "East is East and West is West" and began to watch our neighbors instead of the eastern seed catalogues. By this method we have learned that if we choose as nature teaches us, from families of flowers native to the prairies and then cultivate as faithfully as we do our potatoes, we can have gorgeous borders sur - passing the dreams of those who must depend upon thin and sandy soil and cold summers. Of course peonies and iris come first on this list, but since they are a topic now handled by our specialists, I will devote myself to secondary families. Begin with Achillea — the blessing of August. Have you tried its rose form, and what a comfort Perry's White is both for bouquets and border. White is the brightest tone we have and Perry's White Achillea can make a garden look fresh and perky even after a hot wind from Kansas. The Yellow Achillea is ideal for rock gardens. Anchusa, with ■ its cousins Myosotis and Mertensia, are right at home in our soil, but we must remember to let the Myosotis freeze up wet because it is so shallow rooted that winter dryness kills it. Anemones are with me still an experiment and. not to be depended upon except for our lovely native form Sylvestris. Pulsatilla, the Pasque Flower of Nebraska, will not grow in my garden. Japonica is behaving pretty well, but is in an extremely well protected nook. Aquilegia is one- of our treasures and will always be the backbone of our "right after iris" season when we miss the color masses that have vanished. The long spurred hybrids are fairy like both in color and form and when used in masses blend in exquisite pastel color com - binations. The yellow "Chrysantha" blooms faithfully far into August. Artemisia is best in its forms that give us grey foliage. Its autumn form, Lactiflora, is too weed-like in our rich soil to please a* dainty taste. Asclepias, both the orange form for the dry border and the pink for the swamp, are popular natives that many like. Aster, Hardy, is the perennial that to me seems to have the biggest future for us. Marvelous new varieties in double and semi-double forms and in a color range from peach blossom pink through all the lavenders to pure blue are to be had in forms from one to five feet high. And we O7.) </seg>
            <seg id="p558">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE -BOARD OF AGRICULTURE all know how they thrive -along our roadsides. September and October can rival June for color mass when we get them established. &gt; Bocconia with its white plumes and classic leaves is another treasure of our own. Boltonia in both white and lavender can be. used freely if cut back enough so that it will not "tumble." Have you tried Cassia marilandica for a dash of feathery yellow in. August? It shows its kinship to the Acacia of California and Oh, but it grows taller here than it does in New York!

            <seg id="p561">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY THE PRESIDENT: Our time is up now. There is to be an illus - trated lecture/given in the Student Activities Building in a joint meeting with the Home Economics Group. We thought it would be a very good idea if we could hear Professor Swenk this afternoon or this evening at the Cornhusker after the. Nurserymen's banquet. THE PRESIDENT: We will now adjourn to the Student Activities Building to hear Mr. E. A. Marshall, Kalamazoo, Michigan, on the sub - ject of "Beautifying the Home Grounds." BEAUTIFYING THE HOME GROUNDS E. A. MARSHALL, Kalamazoo, Michigan (NOTE: This lecture was the building and development of a picture as the speaker proceeded.) MR. MARSHALL: This subject of "Beautifying the Home Grounds" is one which has aroused tremendous interest, so much so that there are several million subscribers, to magazines regarding home and home development. During the war the American people could not build many new homes, so at the close of the war we needed 600,000 houses. As an illustration, in New York before the war there were 1000 families want - ing homes, and after the war 12,000. Congestion was very great. One house was found where there were four families in the four corners of one room ; they said they got along all right excepting that the family in that corner (indicating) was taking in boarders. One of these fami - lies was Mr. and Mrs. Green. Mrs. Green told him about the difficulties — it seems that some dirt .fell on the porch of Mrs. McCarthy; she says, "The Saints preserve me, I ought to make you scrub my porch." Mr. Green became disgusted with the crowding and he decides to buy a lot and build a house, but he didn't know where to buy. Never buy a lot where you are going to lose money, for example, in a factory or rented district. Don't buy where people are all renters. Build in a place where somebody else will want it, and don't build a freak house, for you will have to wait for a freak to buy it. So Mr. Green went out and bought a lot. He didn't know much about building houses and didn't count the cost and was compelled to put on a very heavy mortgage. Mr. Green wanted to beautify his home and he got something his grandmother used — he got an old gypsy kettle and some geraniums, petunias, and wandering jews. When he put these in there he thought he would later have a fine kettle of flowers, but he discovered something. When the hot mcnth of July came he thought he had fine flowers, but he found he had planted a cemetery. When we want to put something </seg>

            <seg id="p564">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTUKE in the yard we should know what the plants require; if we don't we can't expect them to grow. If you put plants in the hot sun- that re - quire shade, don't wonder why they die. The fundamental thing in trying to grow plants is to know what they require, and there isn't a catalogue in America that don't tell you. All you have to do is to find the name of the plant and then look it up in the catalogue. Mr. Green was deficient right there and he was unfortunate in another thing — his wife didn't know plants either. Ladies usually know more or less about them, but Mrs. Green had been brought up in a happy-go-lucky way. Here is what she put in the front yard (indicating chicken coop with hen and chickens). Mr. Green Was an ambitious man, but the difficulty was he was too busy with other things to care for his yard. One day when the lawn needed mowing he said, I will buy a lawn mower, and this is what he bought (a cow). That mess in the front yard tells the story of the people who .live inside. Mr. Green lived here awhile and he found that he had to move because that mortgage became due. The man with the note and mort - gage came out to collect on the mortgage. Mr. Green had an automobile that he had been running around with, but he didn't have money enough to pay the mortgage on his home. So he put a price on it that would cover his investment in the house and lot. But people weren't inter - ested in the property at that price because of the outside appearance of the place. He finally had to sell at a loss because he had never studied how to develop his home. One of the fundamental things in public school teaching today is plant knowledge, all one's life they can enjoy the knowledge of plants. One of the most remarkable things we can put into child life is plant life. So Mr. Green was compelled to sell at a loss of hundreds of hard' earned dollars. He sold to Mr. and Mrs. Wise. They were different people; they -loved flowers, and they told Mr. Green to take the old lawn mower along, and the kettle, and the chickens, too. (Takes these articles off of the picture.) ■ Then they said we must develop the home grounds properly. The first thing necessary is to connect the home with civilization; so they put in a sidewalk. A house with a walk is an invitation for people to come and see you. The next thing needed is something near the front door that will attract attention of the passer-by. (Attaches painting of hydrangas and peonies to picture.) Then put some spirea under the sun parlor window and you will have fine foliage all the rest of the year and it lasts until the frost cuts them down. When I came back from Africa (I had had the fever twenty times there), I went to North Carolina and bought a home. I was so weak I could scarcely use a hoe; nevertheless I got so I could work a little </seg>
            <seg id="p565">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY and I beautified the home and about two years later a man came along and offered me $2,000.0a more than I gave for it When you see a shiftless home, you say what hum-drum man lives there. Now take one good look at that picture and then close your eyes please until I tell you you may look again. Now look, I have taken off all of the flowers and improvements. Which home would you like to live in and have your children live in?' Home is a memory, and mem - ories of childhood serve to build character. That reminds me of the time when I was lecturing in Pennsylvania. Three ladies came to me and asked me to take a ride with them to look over the town; they said there were three men that ran the town. These three city officers would not spend money for improving the appearance of the streets, parks or cemetery. Nor would they permit any civic group to do so. The curse of those' men is just resting on that town and the children growing up are having fed into them the rag bag system of the town. All their lives they are going to be contented to live in weed patches. I would rather be brought up where there is something that stirs my soul. Mr. Wise lived in this house for awhile and for the reason that the children were growing up and needed more room, and once in a while grandfather and grandmother came there and auntie came. So they sold the place, but do you think they lost money? No, sir, they made money on the same house that Mr. Green lost money on. When Mr. and Mi's. Wise sold they got a large ten-room house, a Colonial home, and as soon as they bought it they were fixing it over. The first thing they did was to change the porch (takes off porch and replaces it with a new porch) and built a walk and driveway. They put up a covered driveway and built a drive running down to the street. (While talking, made changes in the picture.) The next thing they built was a sun parlor (makes change in the picture). Some 'people have a wrong idea about a sun parlor. They have the idea it is only for use in the winter. It really is good all the year around. The hotter the day the better. Suppose on a real hot day you have some people call and you hope they won't stay long; just take them right into the sun parlor. I want to show you how many people beautify their homes. I want every one of you to catch the thought and carry it away with you and never forget it. (Pins clothes line with clothes on it on the picture.) Then Mr. Marshall puts in a lily pond and a rock garden with some stairs connecting the pool and the rock garden, saying, I will put these </seg>

We want our landscape scene to balance, so we will go over on the other side and we will plant four rows of windbreak spruce trees here (indicating). Then plant something in front of it in the way of shrubs, snowballs and other things. Use shrubs that will give you color in front of it, dogwood, etc., then following with spirea, wigelia and lilacs and you will have flowers blooming all the year. I might add that perennials like phlox would be good. And put in perennial border like this (indicating). It is a good thing to have the border divided into four sections for blooming in May, June, July, August and September. And put something that is green and tall like chrysanthemums in front of the shrubs and in front of that some low growing border plants like Dianthus. Now let us put in some garden accessories like a pergola. The next thing is to cover it with roses and build a tea house next to it and cover that with Wisteria. Next we will build a rose garden with a gate like this (indicating). In order to complete the balance I will put some evergreens on the other side of the walk. Now there is a question I want to ask: Have you looked at that long enough? (Pointing to the clothes line.) Well, then, we'll hide the clothes line by building a trellis in front of it and planting grapes there. Then build a little playhouse for the children and cover that with Wisteria. Next, in front of the house plant evergreens, Juniper and Blue Spruce; then plant some in the corner by the pergola and some on the other side of the sun parlor. I Now we will put a tree back of the pergola and one by the lily pond and one over to the left back of the trellis and one in front of the pergola. When I was visiting in the east I learned of two old men who seventy-five years ago planted some trees in the town and the people of the town laughed at them, but seventy-five years later the people marveled at the foresight of the two old men and they erected a tablet to the memory of the two old men who thought enough of the trees to plant them. I wish there were two such old men in every town. Now this place isn't simply to look at. Here is a little boy at the lily pond and here is his dog (makes addition to the picture of these features). Here is his sister picking flowers to decorate the dining - room table. When daddy comes home to supper here is the older sister </seg>

Now this isn't for the children only; over on the other side under the trees is a table, chairs and benches— a nice place for a young lady to come out in the evening and sit down and wait for someone. That reminds me of a story. Johnnie's mother said, "Johnnie, you go and hoe in the garden." ,A lady came to see his mother, and she called, "Johnnie, is your mother home?" Johnnie called back, "Hey, you don't think I would be working here if she was away, do you?" The way for a good child to work in the garden is for the man to work in the garden with him. That boy will enjoy his home. If you want good husbands for your girls, get boys that have been trained to love their home, flowers and trees, then you have planted something in a child's heart and when he grows up he will remember it. Someone said if a woman loves a rose she will get one. If a boy loves a home he will get one. There is one other thing I want to put on this picture— it comes in three colors and when you plant it it never dies— and that is the good old Star Spangled Banner. You will pardon me for saying that my good wife was the artist who painted this picture and I might say incidentally that she is just as good as the picture. You may have a different kind of a home; it may set far back from the road, or right close to the road; it may be a big house or a small bungalow, but they all need landscaping, and one of the greatest things about landscaping is, when you come to sell your home it will sell at a profit. I thank you. </seg>

If those of you who are in the rear of the room will come forward and occupy these vacant seats we will not only present a more compact audience to our speakers, but it will leave the rear seats vacant for those who may come in late. To you, the members of the Nebraska Improved Live Stock Breed - ers' Association, and our other good friends, I extend a' warm welcome. In behalf of this institution which you so heartily support, I want to say that we are glad to have you with us. We enjoy your annual visits. We appreciate your cooperation. We like to work with you and for you. I hope your visit here will prove to be a highly satisfactory one. The program which has been prepared for you at the direction of your board of directors is, in so far as we are able to make it, the sort of thing which, it is believed, will be most pleasing and profitable. We hope you will be critical of it and offer such suggestions as you may have for its improvement. We have here a question box and each of you has been supplied with blank cards. If any questions arise during the course of the program for which you think opportunity is not best for complete discussion, write them down on the card and drop them in the box and </seg>
            <seg id="p575">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATION they will receive attention at the close of the session. If at any time during: the talk you want to discuss any point more fully, I am sure the speakers will not object to being: interrupted. Most of them, I be - lieve, are married and accustomed to being- interrupted when they talk anyway. Since this afternoon is to be given over to the discussion of sheep, your committee decided that in the absence of your president, Mr. Graff, Professor Weber, who is in charge of the sheep experimental work at this institution, would be requested to preside. Professor Weber, as most of you already know, came to this institution' from Kansas. He is a young professor of unusual ability and is especially popular with our student body. Many of you are acquainted with his work with sheep. Through it he is gaining considerable prominence in the state. Professor Weber, I yield the gavel to you. MR. WEBER, CHAIRMAN: Professor Gramlich, my chief, has been very kind in his introduction. I only wish I could absolutely live up to the assignment that he has given me. It is the first duty of a chairman, as I see it, to be little seen and heard from much less, and since we are already fifteen minutes behind schedule, I am going to proceed immediately with the business of the day. The first thing we have on the program this afternoon will be a demonstration by Mr. Thalman. Most. of us know how the lamb looks on the outside, but because of the limited butchering of lambs, many of us do not know the different cuts of a lamb carcass. So Mr. Thalman will show you "What's Under the Wool." Mr. Thalman: Mr. Thalman gave a very interesting and educational demonstra - tion of the lamb carcass after it was cut up. Many of the men did not know of the different cuts and roasts that could be carved from a lamb, and there was much interest shown. Some of the men bought these roasts after the meeting. MR. WEBER: While Mr. Thalman is disposing of his carcass we will go on with the discussion. I imagine he will want to sell these cuts, so if any of you are potential buyers, he will be glad to see you after the meeting. We have a question box which Mr. Waggener just brought in. Cards will be distributed and if you have questions on these cards, pass them in and they will be answered at the close of the meeting. If you have any questions on sheep diseases, feel free to ask about them also. Dr. Skidmore will be here and will be glad to answer or try to answer any of the questions you might have. After the meeting is over, if it isn't too late, and I believe that it will not be, I shall be glad to go with any of you over to the Sheep Barns </seg>
            <seg id="p576">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE and show you our sheep plant, and the experimental lambs which we have on feed. If we can congregate here near the door after the meet - ing is over, we can make that little trip. Just pass these questions in at any time during the meeting. If ycu have more than one question, do not hesitate to write it down too. There is one man that usually appears on our live stock programs. He is able to look into the future and tell us some of the things that may happen. The sheep business and sheep prices are particularly favorable at this time, and we are all anxious to know just what the future holds for us. So I want to call at this time on Mr. Harold Hedges who will talk on "Can Lamb Prices Hold Up Through 1929?" Mr. Hedges: CAN LAMB PRICES HOLD UP THROUGH 1929? HAROLD HEDGES I hate to get up here on the stage. It makes me think I will have to make a speech and I really intend to just talk to you regarding the lamb situation as we see it. From what Mr. Weber said, you might think I am a prophet, but I make no claim to be anything like that. It re - minds me of a story told on "Dad," as we all call him around here. He does not propose to be a horse man, but sometimes he can answer questions that are asked him about horses. A farmer said to him, "Now, Mr. Weber, I have a horse down on the farm. Sometimes it appears to be sound and at other times it goes lame. What will I do with it?" Dad said, "The next time it appears to be sound, why sell it." As Mr. Weber said, the last few years have bten quite favorable for the lamb feeder and the lamb producer. We have had perhaps five or six quite favorable years. Some feeders have lost because of the high fluctuation of prices, but on the whole the sheep business has been profitable now for five or six years. Of course we would like to see it continue so, but it isn't always best to let past profits and our desires for the future breed an optimism that may warp our judgment and lead us astray. In the next' few minutes I want to review briefly the present sheep and lamb situation and consider it in the light of what has happened in the past thirty years. Whether or not it gives you a better idea of the present status of the sheep business or some sug - gestion as to possible developments in the next year or two remains for you to decide. Sheep Production and Prices Move in Cycles Sheep production and prices show a tendency to move in cycles similar to those in cattle and hogs, but hardly as well defined as in the case of the latter two classes. That is, production and prices tend to </seg>
            <seg id="p577">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATION move in a general upward direction through a period of time, then turn in the opposite direction downward. These cycles average around eight to eleven years from low to low or high to high. At the present time we are definitely on the up side of the production cycle. The last low point- in sheep numbers in the United States was in 1922, when the number on farms was about thirty-six million head. The increase in numbers was quite slow until 1925, but since then has been much more rapid, the number reaching forty-four and one-half million head on January 1, 1928. The increase in numbers during 1927 was 2,700,000 head, bringing the total to the largest number since 1911. In about ten days the number as of January 1, 1929, will be issued by the U. S. De - partment of Agriculture. Sheep Slaughter Not on Increase Sheep slaughter has not increased in the same proportion as have sheep numbers. Federally inspected slaughter, which makes up more than three-fourths of the total slaughter in the United States, has in - creased frcm 10,929,000 in 1922 to. 12,882,000 in 1927, a gain of a little less than two million head. In that same period the total number of sheep has shown an increase of eight and one-half million head. It is evident from this that slaughter has been held down by the tendency to hold back ewe lambs to expand flocks. When this tendency will cease is a matter of speculation, but its probable effect should not be overlooked, because it could result in a material increase in number of sheep and lambs available for slaughter. Prices Stable for the Past Six Years The moderate increase since 1922 in the supply of mutton and lamb available for consumption has been offset by an increase in demand so that prices have been on a fairly stable basis in the past six years if we disregard short periods of high and low prices due to wide varia - tions in market supplies. It is questionable, however, if demand can be expanded sufficiently to take care of any material increase in sup - plies such as could readily occur when only the normal number of lambs are held back for replacement or some liquidation of flocks occurs, as has happened in the past. It is evident, then, that there is need for considerable caution at the present time in regard to further expansion of sheep production: Wool Almost as Important as Meat . Any analysis of the sheep and lamb situation is complicated by the fact that the meat is not the only product of the sheep. Wool is almost as important a product, and it is affected by market factors in many ways distinctly different from those affecting mutton and lamb. </seg>
            <seg id="p578">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE For one thing, the meat is largely on a domestic basis; that is, foreign supplies play practically no part in influencing prices. On the other hand, wool is on an import basis since practically half of the United States consumption is cared for from foreign sources. Consequently some consideration must be given to the sheep situation in foreign countries. Increase in Wool Production World wool production has been increasing during the past few years, although the per capita production is still less than in the pre - war period, 1909-1913, when production was at- the peak of a cycle. Further material increases in the number of sheep in the world does not seem very likely, however. Numbers in New Zealand and Argentina are probably near or past the peak with little prospect of expansion of the sheep industry because of a trend toward other enterprises — dairying in New Zealand and crop farming in Argentina. In Australia the recurrence of periodic drouth periods makes ex - pansion beyond present limits rather doubtful. Drouth conditions in 1926 and 1927 caused considerable liquidation so there may be recovery to the number in that country in 1926. South Africa has been expand - ing the sheep industry and further expansion seems likely with natural conditions quite favorable for it. However, it is likely to proceed slowly. In the northern hemisphere expansion has been taking place in both Europe and North America, but seems to be approaching the peak. Gain in Weight of Fleece One thing requiring consideration is the gain in average weight of fleece. A notable gain has been made in Australia where the average weight per fleece has increased more than a third in the last twenty-five years. In the United States the same tendency to improve the fleece is evident. In 1915 the average weight per fleece was 6.8 pounds; in 1928 it is estimated to be 7.8 pounds. Increase in Demand for Wool As to the immediate wool . situation, the current available supply will probably be a little different from the past two years. The 1928 clip is probably slightly larger than in 1927 and about equal to 1926. Offsetting the slight gain in wool stocks is a probable increase in de - mand due both to the gain in population and some improvement in general business conditions. Tariff on Wool No discussion of the sheep business is complete without mention of the tariff. As said before, mutton prices are on a domestic basis with </seg>
            <seg id="p579">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATION neither imports nor exports affecting- the market in any large degree. Wool, on the other hand, receives material tariff protection. Carpet wools are admitted duty free, but the tariff of 31 cents per pound (scoured basis) on clothing: wools is a major factor in sustaining; United States wool prices. So long: as there is uncertainty in the tariff policy there will be an element of uncertainty in the sheep business. 1928 Crop Increase Over Last Two Years It is the lamb producer who has particular interest in production and price cycles which extend over a period of years. The future market of the sheep, feeder is less distant and his interest is more in the immediate supply and demand situation. If you saw the federal report on the 1928 lamb crop issued last July, you will recall that it indicated an increase of 8 per cent over the lamb crop of 1927 and of 9 per cent over the 1926 crop. This increase was almost entirely in the western states where more ewes lambed out than in the preceding: year and a larger proportion of the lambs were saved. In the native sheep states there were more ewes in the flocks, but a smaller per cent of the lambs were saved, so that the total lamb crop was practically the same as in 1927. The 8 per cent increase in lamb crop would mean an increase of about' 1,800,000 head of lambs. Figuring that half the crop were wether lambs, it would be reasonable to expect that market supplies during the present marketing season would be augmented by 900,000 head at least. If only enough ewe lambs are retained for replacement pur - poses, the market supply might be increased considerably more. Re - ports from the range states indicate a general tendency to retain many of the ewe lambs. In view of this tendency and an increase in number of ewes to be culled from the flocks which are larger than in previous years, an increase of 5 to 7 per cent in market receipts would seem reasonable. , Early Receipts Heavy in 1928 Actual receipts at seven principal markets from August to Novem - ber, inclusive, were 11 per cent heavier than in the same months last year. Judging from the increase in market supplies that was to be expected and the still larger gain in numbers already received at the markets, it seems evident that early receipts have been heavier than normal, and that receipts during the rest of the winter may run only slightly, if any, heavier than last year, thus suggesting a firmer under - tone for the late winter market. • The movement of feeding sheep passing through the principal mar - kets into the'Cornbelt states from July to November, inclusive, was 12 per cent larger than last year, but 5 per cent smaller than in 1926. </seg>
            <seg id="p580">REPORT OK NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE After dropping off materially in October, out-shipments showed a good gain in November, but have slackened again in December. Direct ship - ments into Cornbelt feedlots was probably larger than last fall. Al - though greater in Nebraska, feeding in western areas is reported to be slightly below a year ago, sufficiently so that it probably about offsets the gain in Cornbelt feeding. A late movement of feeders into Cornbelt and western feed yards has brought the total on feed in all areas up to last year's figure. If we may judge from the location of the lambs on feed and use past experience to give us an idea of the usual time of movement to market, we may arrive at a reasonable expectation of the distribution of market receipts in the next few months. Considering the heavy eaTly movement of lambs to Cornbelt farms, one would expect a plenti - ful supply arriving at markets from Cornbelt feed lots. The heavy end of that movement is usually over by February 1. As was stated be - fore, western feed lots are hardly as heavily stocked as last year, so market receipts of fed lambs in the late winter and early spring should be moderate. ;■'•■' I .: ■ Lamb Must Be Used Soon After Slaughtering The lamb market is materially different from that for hogs and somewhat different from that for cattle in that the meat must be utilized within a very short time after slaughter. A large part of the pork may be cured and stored. Also a fairly large per cent of the beef may be utilized in frozen or prepared form so that immediate disposal is not necessary. Since lamb and mutton is utilized in fresh form, the market is very sensitive to variations in receipts. Consequently,, that makes the program of even distribution of market supplies which western lamb feeders carried out so effectively last winter and spring so essen - tial in maintaining price levels. The general price level for sheep and lambs may be considered hardly as high as a year age because of the substantial gain in sheep production. That is one factor working against a higher level of prices in the coming months when western, feed yards are emptied than pre - vailed last winter and spring, even the supplies in western areas are probably not as large as a year ago. It is safe to say one thing, how - ever. An early glut of the market because of poor distribution of supplies could easily depress it to a point where it would be doubly difficult to bring about recovery later. Your program of orderly mar - keting certainly deserves your careful consideration to make it effective. Consumer demand for both Iamb and wool is closely associated with the general condition of business in the country. Demand for these products is more elastic than for some of the other farm products, and </seg>
            <seg id="p581">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATION hinges largely on the ability of consumers in large industrial areas to buy them. Then, too, the price level of competing products is an im - portant factor influencing consumption. General business has shown distinct recovery from the slump in the last half of 1927. With the employment situation improved and wage rates continuing on a high level, consumer demand for lamb during the first half of 1929 should equal or exceed that of the early months of 1928. One element of weakness in the situation is the possibility of material reaction in the stock market which might lessen confidence in the future. Probable Increase in Demand for Lamb Smaller supplies of competing meats should reflect to improve de - mand for lamb and mutton. A little more beef may be. available in the early months of 1929, judging from the heavy fall movement of . stocker and. feeder cattle into feed lots, but production of pork and poultry is likely to be smaller and prices on a higher level than in the first half of 1928. To summarize the demand situation for lamb and mutton, it appears probable that demand will- expand sufficiently to care for the increase in supplies that may be available from the larger lamb crop of 1928. More Wool for Future Much the same situation prevails as regards consumptive demand for wool. Factors favoring increased demand are the increased business activity in the United States, normal increase in population and con - tinued improvement in economic conditions abroad. Less favorable is the increased competition from other textiles. However, demand should expand enough so that the larger world production of wool in 1928 should' move into consumptive channels without material change in price levels. Future Looks Favorable Summarizing the whole situation, it seems safe to conclude that the immediate future is quite favorable for the producer and feeder of sheep and lambs. However, looking further ahead, a word of caution is not amiss, considering the rapid expansion in sheep production in the United States in recent years. After such a development it is well to keep a sharp lookout ahead for signs that may indicate that the turn is approaching. MR. WEBER: I think we are all agreed that there are many fac - tors that may affect the sheep business and the sheep industry. None of us have any formulae for success in this business. You know there are niany things, which we don't expect, that may happen. We always have to be on the lookout. We not only have to take care of feeding </seg>
            <seg id="p582">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE and management problems, but there is always the breeding end to take care of. There are a great many flocks of purebred sheep through - out the United States and these breeders are attempting to improve these flocks with the hopes that they can sell their rams and ewes to good advantage and by that method improve the general run of sheep throughout the country. At the South Dakota Experiment Station they have been conduct - ing an experiment for some time, attempting to improve sheep in a rather novel manner. At this time I want to call on Professor Turner Wright of the South Dakota Experiment Station, Brookings, South Dakota. He will talk on "The Breeding of Tail-less Sheep." Professor Wright: THE BREEDING OF TAIL-LESS SHEEP PROFESSOR TURNER WRIGHT Mr. Waggener wrote me to come down and asked me to give a twenty or thirty minute talk. I assure you that I can tell all about our work in twenty or thirty minutes. If I could have some of those sheep down here in this pavilion and you could see them and we could talk about them in front of you, then perhaps we could spend a greater amount of time than that. ■ ■ I was at a loss, in a way, to know just how to present this matter, so I fixed up a few little exhibits and brought along which I thought might be of help in putting across this speech. I have been given considerable credit for this work that has been done in the breeding of tail-less sheep. That credit should go to Pro - fessor J. W. Wilson, who is head of the Animal Husbandry Department and Director of the South Dakota Experiment Station. Work Began at South Dakota Thirteen Years Ago Those men who are familiar with sheep "breeding, if you will think back over the history of some of our leading breeds of sheep, for ex - ample the Cheviots, Lincolns, Shropshires. and Southdowns, you will recall that it took a great many years to establish definite breeds of those types. I will say that this work at South Dakota has not been in progress long enough that we could come to anyways near saying that a definite breed of sheep has been developed. However, we have ob - tained some results which right now appear quite promising. 'The history of this work goes back about thirteen years. I don't know just how long Professor Wilson has had this in his mind. However, about thirteen years ago, Professor N. E. Hansen made a trip to Siberia in search for hardy fruits which could be used in the rigorous climate in </seg>
            <seg id="p583">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATION the northern part of our state," and practically all the northern part of the United States. He brought over some hardy alfalfa, plums, and other plants which were adapted to South Dakota: conditions. While on that trip, Mr. Hansen obtained a few specimens of the Siberian fat rump sheep. I brought along some pictures here that I shall pass around and which will show you some of those sheep. I have here two of the pictures of the original rams which were brought over by Pro - fessor Hansen. (Passes pictures.) You will notice that these sheep are very unlike most sheep of this country in type. Trying to Get Tail-less Sheep The original type of sheep was a sheep that possessed long hair rather than wool. Maybe I should say they possessed long hair with a fur undercovering. The Siberian sheep, the native of Siberia — that fat rumped sheep, has a 1 wool of that type. You can see about the length of the hair. (Shows wool on card.) There is a very short under - covering among that hair that kept the sheep from freezing. Now these sheep were tail-less sheep. They have fat rumps, but were not the broad tailed type. Professor Wilson had in mind that by using these sheep to cross on the native sheep he could produce a breed of sheep that would be naturally tail-less that would not have to be docked. While docking is not such an expensive operation, yet it is quite a chore, and on many of our smaller farms it is neglected. These sheep do not have to be docked. His problem is to get a sheep without a tail — a sheep that would possess a good fleece and at the same time possess good wooling qualities. I was interested in Mr. Hedges' talk about the supply of wool. He stated we used wool for many different kinds of clothing, but that we didn't use as much clothing as we used. to. I believe that most any - one that had been with me yesterday morning when we were getting ready to start on this trip would have put on wool clothing if he had had it. When we stepped out on the porch in the morning it was 31 below, and I am sure that wool clothing would have felt pretty good to start on a long drive, and that he would want all the wool clothing that he could get on. I have. another picture of one of those fat rumps which I want to start around. It is a rear view, and you will notice that there is an excessive amount of fat carried by those sheep. (Shows picture.) Assyrians Use Fat for Butter A great deal of mutton of the cheap and coarser grades is eaten by the Slovaks and Assyrians and people of that nationality. A number of the lambs have these excessive fat rumps and so we thought that (18) </seg>
            <seg id="p584">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE might be wasted. However, when those lambs went through the slaughter test, the butchers very carefully saved all of that fat. I said, "What will you dp with that?" The answer was, "That is the Assyrian's butter. They will give us 50 cents a pound for that." Method of Crossbreeding ; . . These Siberian fat ramped rams were mated to a band of grade ewes. They were just grade sheep. They carried, without question, some Cheviot blood. They also carried some Shropshire blood. A part of these ewes were a cross between the Shropshire and the Cheviot. This all goes back to the law in breeding, which I will just touch briefly upon here. In cross-breeding there is a tendency for characters to segregate and in in-breeding there is a tendency to bring those together again. In other words, in cross-breeding we would have sheep of all types. In this work the main job was for the. man to watch when the sheep arrived to find just what he wanted and then by selection to develop that type of sheep. It was nine years before any very definite progress was made. I have a picture here of a ram that I am going to pass around that appeared after nine years of work which gives promise of being the kind of a sheep that Professor Wilson had in mind. (Passes picture of ram.) He is open faced, has a compact fleece and a heavy coat of wool. You will notice that that ram is a pretty good type of ram. He has a good, strong fleece. 1 Now in that breeding work we found not only variation in color and type of sheep, but there has also been found a wide variation in fleece. This sample from the thigh shows .a considerable amount of short wool undercovering. (Shows sample of wool.) Along the fol - lowing year we had a ram developed in the. flock which was absolutely devoid of tail. No more tail than if you had taken the lamb and cut off the tail just as close to the rump as you could get it. (Shows picture.) This is a picture of a tail-less ewe which we had in our flock. Unfortunately this ewe was given an overdose of medicine for stomach worms which resulted fatally. I have here the spinal column taken from that ewe. I thought you might be interested in knowing what the condition of the tail was in that ewe. Those two bones were wound together — just one little button pressing right in at the end of the tail just like that. There is a complete absence of tail. This lamb's sire proved to be a sire- that would get a large percentage of tail-less sheep cr very short-tailed lambs. About 50 per cent were without tails and 50 per cent with very short tails. We had some other lambs from him in the flock that proved to be very good sires. i Various Types Obtained You will notice all colors. There is a tendency, when you go to cross-breeding animals, to revert back to original types. You will find, </seg>
            <seg id="p585">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS.' ASSOCIATION in these pictures, practically all. colors. Some have wide, fat rumps and some have long tails. We still find some in the flock coming out with long tails. Some have hair and some have wool. There has been a steady progress made each year in this development. Now we have this year at the college farm two rams that give especial promise. I think they are the best that we have produced. (Shows picture of these rams.) You will notice the little white ram has absolutely no tail. There is a lamb that is a very good mutton form, a lamb that has an excellent fleece, and one that gives promise of giving us fairly good results. We are mating him this year with eighteen ewes, all of which were born without tails. That lamb, if you. could get your hands on him, you would find that he has a wee indication of a tail and absolutely none of that padding around the tailor rump which is characteristic of the Siberian lambs. The other ram, the one that is shown here in this picture (shows picture) is giving promise of being a very good ram. That is a .very fine type for market Both of these lambs show very good mutton qualities. (Passes other samples.) Quite a bit of progress has been made when you can go from a fleece of that type and come into the fleece of the type that No. 1367 has. Along about last November we divided up a bunch of these lambs into six lots, and put them on feed We did that not only to test the quality of these lambs as feeders, but also to watch the progress of each individual. Average Daily Gain Made I am not going to comment on these results other than to point out the average daily gain made by those lambs. The lowest average daily gain was .35 of a pound and the highest average daily gain was 45 of a pound. Stomach Worms This experiment also shows another thing. We are troubled with stomach worms, and around about the last of October we found that these ewes were quite wormy. In fact, we lost four or five from worms. We treated them with the regular worm treatment— copper sulphate— and put them back on the experiment. You can see from the chart that they grew very rapidly and were in good condition. That just brings, out the possibility of using some of these native lambs and using them more in the feed lot than we have done before. Now if there are any questions, I will be glad to answer them for you. If not, thank you. QUESTION: What is the total amount of grain consumed per day? ANSWER: I have not figured the amount of feed per 100 pounds of gain, but it could easily be figured. We have the total amount of </seg>
            <seg id="p586">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE r feed consumed and the number of days the lambs were on feed, and by dividing we would get the daily consumption. The main thing I wanted to point out was the rate of gain on these lambs. We consider from .35 to .45 of a pound very good gain on lambs. . QUESTION: How did these ewes dress out? ANSWER: Those lambs that I took down to Sioux. Falls — the younger lambs were 62 days and the older lambs 82 days. These lambs all dressed very favorably. QUESTION: Do you suppose that was due to the fatted condition about the tail — that they dressed so satisfactorily? ■ ANSWER: No, I think not. They made excellent carcasses, being very plump and fat. In that bunch of lambs there were about five car - casses that were the nicest of any spring lambs that I have ever seen. At this point the Home Economics Club had a surprise for the group. They served lamb chop sandwiches, which were enjoyed by the crowd. MR. WEBER: We are going right on with the program. We have a, man with us this afternoon that many of you know, a man who has fed a great many hogs and cattle, and this year he started in the sheep business. I take pleasure in introducing Mr. Dan Hildebrand. I ■ .'-. WHY I SHIFTED TO SHEEP DAN HILDEBRAND Professor Weber, Ladies and Gentlemen: You know it certainly is a pleasure to me to know that there is a gentleman who just came oat here to advocate that he is a ranchman and I have been visiting with a gentleman here whom all of you know, Mr. Young. For a feeder it is different. This gentleman is trying to hunt ways and means of main - taining fertilization on his farm without having to buy these high - priced cattle, and no doubt some of you men are having the same prob - lem that he is. It reminds me of a little story of a clergyman. He was comparing himself and the congregation to the sheep and the shepherd. He put the following question to the children: "What does the shepherd do for the sheep?" A small boy in the front row said, "He shears them." </seg>

When we sell these sheep and know that the wool is going to pay the feed bill, I haven't found anybody— any ranchman— that will tell me that the calves that I buy from him in a group are going to pay the feed bill this spring in the form of a by-product That is what these ewes will do for you. You know I have been feeding cattle for a good many years. I still have some cattle on the farm just for fear that maybe the sheep wouldn't pay out. Buy Western Ewes . . ' ■ I . . Folks, this is an exceptional age. For the past two years we have been experimenting. We have been buying these western ewes that have broken mouths, yet ewes that could run in the cornbelt These ewes are taken up in the high mountains of Colorado, up where it frosts every night. Three bucks are placed with every one hundred ewes, or an average of three bucks to one hundred ewes. This last year we purchased 2500 and put them in the mountains of Colorado. </seg>
            <seg id="p588">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD .OF AGRICULTURE The lambs are just now coming: on. In fact, we had about thirty this past week. These ewes are turned in separately. It means that the buck expense is entirely eliminated. It means also that the feed bill is taken care of for a matter of sixty days. It means that you do not have to compete with the ranchman with these ewes coming to market in the fall. It means that you can continue to feed these fat ewes if you wish to do so. High-priced Lambs in April and May If you will take the trouble to study the Journal Stockman's Annual paper — their annual number which was put out lately — and check back the high prices of lambs for the last thirty years, you will find in the majority of the cases that the high-priced lamb is in Apiil and May. That is, it is an exception when that is not true. Last year these spring lambs brought as high as 20 or 25 cents on the Omaha market. The average was around 19.25. It means that these ewes must be handled differently than the ordinary range ewes. You are handling- them for a different purpose. When you receive these ewes from the range you should put them on your corn at an early period. Remember that these ewes were thin when they went to the mountains and that they had raised a lamb already during that year. You must feed them ; plenty of corn to get them fat before lambing if you expect them to produce a good, strong, healthy lamb. If the ewe is not fat when she lambs, you will have more trouble in getting that ewe to claim her lamb, because it is a fact that a ewe that does not have milk will not claim her lamb as a rule. If she is fat the wool crop .will be increased a pound or two. You have your wool crop and the lamb crop to consider in feeding ewes. ■ - Ewe and Lamb Proposition a Good Investment You will pardon me for referring to one of my neighbors who lives just east of Seward. He bought 220 head of these ewes. If this gen - tleman were here this afternoon he would tell you that after paying $1720 for these ewes and approximately $800 feed bill, that he banked $1500 net profit on the double deck car of ewes. I am wondering where a man could go and invest approximately $1700 and bank $3200 in an eight-months period of time ? That is about the time that it takes to complete the ewe and the lamb proposition. I dare say it cannot be equaled in either cattle or hogs, or any other live stock that we feed on the farm, in so short- a time. There is a market for these ewes that are not profitable on the range, but can be made profitable here in Nebraska. There is not a farmer in Nebraska but what could handle a feed lot of these ewes in a good profit to himself. It means a little extra labor on or about January first. It means that he can market his grain in a venture that is going to deliver him far more profit than would be rendered if he sold it to the elevator. It </seg>
            <seg id="p589">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATION means also that his farm is going to produce larger and better crops of grain for having these ewes run over his farm during the winter months. Best System Is to Raise Early Lambs We have found that if you attempt to buy these ewes on the market and breed them late that you must compete with the western lambs. Furthermore, lambs fed grain in the hot summer months and crowded along give you more trouble than if they were fed out in the spring. It extends your operation over a longer period and it does not work out so profitably as the early bred ewe handled in a way to get return of the ewe and the lamb in the shortest time possible. I am wondeing if the time hasn't arrived when each and every farmer must give serious consideration to the producing of more Jive stock on the farm than he has ever produced in the history of the state of Nebraska. Secondly, we can't afford to feed these fifty or sixty spring calves and take the chances that we have with high priced corn. Notwithstanding the fact, we appreciate that it is bringing the returns to the range man that, he is no dcubt entitled to for what he has to go through with. He is going to have to give serious consideration if he had a mind to remain in the feeding business. I think they are doing the same thing with the range cow that I am telling you about with reference to the range ewe. Only the ewe probably is much quicker, requires much less feed and makes a quicker turn-over. The problem of restocking the range with cattle is a serious one in that in the fall of the year we haven't forgotten what happened just last fall when everybody was running the range cattle buyer ragged to buy calves. I do believe that the sheep proposition, especially the early bred ewe, offers the best opportunity for a man that there has been in the live stock feeding game of his life— that their return held a far greater profit than he can hope to get out cf the feeding of any other kind of live stock. No doubt all of us would be glad to know what is going to help the hog man, who certainly is confronted with the numerous diseases in these feed yards at this time. You are not confronted with the stomach worms and other forms of disease in these ewes by handling them in the winter time and on so short a time. Rations for Ewes and Lambs Bred ewes do very well by being fed ground alfalfa hay and ground corn, mixed together on a 50-50 basis, and fed in a self-feeder. As soon as the lambs are able to eat grain we grind it finer for them, make them a creep, and feed ground corn, ground oats, a little oil meal and ground alfalfa hay. It certainly is a pleasure to see these little fellows grow. If they were all tail-less, well, that would be fine, but as </seg>
            <seg id="p590">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE it is they are producing profits that cannot be equaled by any live stock raised on your farm. Early-bred Ewes to Tide Over Period of High-priced Feeder Cattle I do believe that if it is. possible for you to make arrangements to get these early bred ewes in Colorado it would be worth the efforts that you put forth. You understand that you must get them in sufficient numbers, for these range men cannot afford to take them up in the mountains and handle them in the manner that I have attempted to describe to you. You can arrange to get them delivered bred, but we have always, on. receiving these ewes, put a few bucks with them to take care of any that might not have been bred in the mountains. How - ever, as a usual thing, fully 80 or 90 per cent of them are properly bred. In conclusion now, I would like to- say. that I think now to tide us over this period of high-priced feeder cattle, no more profitable proposition can be offered to you than the early-bred ewe. I thank you. • I : QUESTION: Do you ever use your sheep in the cornfields in the fall before you gather the corn ? What effect does this have on the ccrn? ANSWER: We run them in the cornfield right along until possibly December. We let the sheep do the. husking. The exercise they get develops them. As far as the sheep hurting the corn — they do not hurt it in the least.. MR. WEBER: There have been a number of questions handed in and those questions on sheep diseases will be answered by Dr. L. V. Skidmore. DR. SKIDMORE: I have been handed a number of questions here regarding the different troubles that you have in connection with your sheep. In looking over these questions, I am afraid that I will have to answer some of them the way my wife answers me sometimes when I ask her a question — "because" — I do not know much more than. I did when I asked her the question. Some of these questions perhaps may not be answered to your own satisfaction, and you will still be in doubt as to what might be the final solution to your question. The beauty of serving in this position is that I am at liberty to "pass the buck," and the' questions that I cannot answer myself I am going to call upon some ethers who have had more experience than I have. </seg>

            <seg id="p592">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ANSWER: I believe this has been the experience of some feeders in feeding animals. The reason, I do not know. I believe that condition is more apt to be observed when they are put on feed rather abruptly. It throws the lambs out of condition. QUESTION: Do you feed some meal to make the she sheep breed to the bucks early ? If not, is there any way that this can be done ? ANSWER: No, I don't believe there is anything you can feed a female sheep that will cause it to breed early. However, I do believe that if you have conditions such as proper shelter and good feed, that perhaps those ewes can be bred earlier in the season of the year than where they are neglected. I don't think that it makes any difference what time of the year ycu breed one particular bunch of ewes. That won't affect them next year. In one flock in Kansas which I observed, the farmer marketed all cf his early lambs. He kept his late lambs each year for replacements. He found after eight years that, he wasn't getting as early lambs as he did. I think the reason for this was that this tendency to breed early is inherited.' QUESTION: When do you get your first ewes bred here? ANSWER: The Rambouillets usually lamb in January, the Shrop - shires some time in February and the Oxfords about the same time as the Shropshires. It is hard to breed the Shropshires and the Oxfords to lamb as early as the Rambouillets. QUESTION: What can be done to sheep that have grubs in the head? Can I pour tobacco juice down their nose? ANSWER: I do not believe that in Nebraska we are so much bothered with sheep grub, but we do find it some. There is no treatment that is. of really any value. I have gone over the various treatments that are recommended and I think the treatment that perhaps is as good as any is to take several drops of chloroform and pour it into the sheep's nostrils. Hold until you have almost choked the sheep. This doesn't usually bring results. Best way is to try to prevent the con - dition if possible. The time of the year when the buck flies are flying, keep the noses of the sheep smeared with tar. I would advise that you chew the tobacco and not use it on the sheep. QUESTION: What causes scabs to come on the lips of feed lot lambs? How cured? ANSWER: These scabs are usually due to some cause, and that cause is an organism which has become infected. Sometimes this is known as the lip and leg ulceration. Treatment is individual and you must treat each animal individually. Perhaps three or four times will </seg>
            <seg id="p593">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATION be necessary. The treatment consists of getting a hold of the animal, raking off the scabs and applying tincture of iodine or some dip like cresolis about a 3 or 4 per cent solution. In some cases where the lesions have developed quite extensively, it might be necessary to use some stronger agent such as 1 part nitric acid to 10 parts water. One must be very careful not to get it in their eyes. If the legs and feet become diseased, it might be necessary to run them through a dipping vat. Copper sulphate solution is sometimes used for this purpose. In connection with the treatment of such animals, remember that they have sore mouths, sore lips. One should take into consideration that such animals, for a time at least, should receive soft feeds in order to give a chance for the sores to heal. QUESTION: These so-called wolf teeth in old sheep. Would it do to pull them or cut them off so they could be fed out? ANSWER: When sheep get very much the trouble with their teeth, I think it is time they go to market You will find that in most cases with sheep it isn't very often necessary to do anything with their teeth. However, if you have some animal that is especially good for breeding purposes, there may be some reason for doing something about it. QUESTION: When feeding lambs, should water be provided plenti - fully or should it be limited? ANSWER: Let them have all they want. QUESTION: How can I get rid of stomach worms in my sheep? What is a good treatment for stomach worms in sheep? ANSWER: Stomach worms in sheep is perhaps the most common parasite that is found in sheep in Nebraska. . It is becoming more prevalent in the east. This question of the control of stomach worms in lambs and sheep is going to become the same as the question of hog lot sanitation problem in swine. There are many factors to be con - sidered in the control of stomach worms that we must know about, and we do know a lot about them already. Remember that you are never going to control stomach worms thoroughly and satisfactorily in the right sort of way by treating them with any kind of medicine. That is not the way we solve the hog worm problem in swine. The control of stomach worms in sheep must be handled from a rotation standpoint, changing of the pastures, and leaving certain fields and lots uninhabited for feeding lambs for some time. We do know that these parasites will live in soil for some time. The next April or May you can go to that same place where you found these eggs in the feces of those sheep and you can find the larvae there and ready to do business. There is always a question as to how long these various kinds of parasites can </seg>
            <seg id="p594">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE live in the soil. Some of them live only a short time, some of them months, and some of them perhaps years. We must make this pro - vision of changing the animals to different parts of the farm. I think perhaps the best treatment for all circumstances, so far as the sheep in Nebraska are concerned, is copper sulphate and nicotine solution, 1 per cent of each. We could take an ounce of nicotine sulphate and an ounce of copper sulphate, mix that in three quarts of water. This is a good remedy which will take care of the stomach worms. QUESTION: How often do you have to treat them? ANSWER: Don't think that because you have treated them once it is going to rid them of the parasites. Sometimes it has been neces - sary to treat them once a month. Five, six or seven times during the year should be sufficient. In the south they have to treat them every three or four weeks. QUESTION: How can you discover that you have stomach worms? ANSWER: . Whenever sheep are not doing well, then I think you should suspect that the sheep have stomach worms. It might be well to take one or two of the animals and have them examined to see if they do have, and take your loss on these one or two and not allow the whole herd to get bad with them. QUESTION: What breed raises the earliest lambs? • ANSWER: In Nebraska we have found that the Rambouillet will breed to lamb the earliest. Hampshires, Shropshires and Oxfords are next. : I- QUESTION: What is the best breed to raise fall lambs ? ANSWER: Dorset Horn ewes will breed to lamb in the fall. They are used in the east for the production of hot house Iambs. QUESTION: What breed of sheep is the most profitable to raise on the farm? ANSWER: The Hampshires are the most popular, but I do not know which is the most profitable. QUESTION: Is oil meal a good feed to use? ANSWER: At this time of the year, this year especially, alfalfa hay is high and scarce, and one must use some protein supplement of that kind. One-third or one-fourth of a pound of oil meal would be a good thing to use. QUESTION: Could alfalfa molasses meal be used successfully? </seg>
            <seg id="p595">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATION . ANSWER: Yes, it can be. We have fed some alfalfa molasses, meal. I wouldn't buy a meal that had too high a percentage of molasses. Our tests here have indicated that one ton of alfalfa molasses meal is equal to one and one-half tons of alfalfa hay. QUESTION: What is the name and address of a good sheep breeder magazine ? ANSWER: The National Wool Grower, published at 508 McCor - mick Building, Salt Lake City, and the American Sheep Breeder, pub - lished at Chicago by the American Sheep Breeder Company, are both good sheep magazines. The subscription price of each is $1.50 per year. QUESTION: Is oil meal better than cottonseed meal? How much per ton ? ANSWER: Our results show that in a general way cottonseed meal and linseed meal are about equal in value. QUESTION: What is a good ration for fattening lambs? ANSWER: Shelled corn and alfalfa hay is the Nebraska standard rat i en, and I don't know how you can beat it. You can substitute silage for part of the alfalfa hay very successfully. QUESTION: What is the best time of year to purchase good, young breeding ewes ? ANSWER: Good, young breeding ewes are scarce. There are a few available the latter part of August, September and October. Sometimes if you will give your order to your commission man he can pick you up a few here and there and get together a good, uniform bunch. HORSE PROGRAM PROF. H. J. GRAMLICH, Chairman Mr. Harry D.

Flack of the College has just recently re - turned from a trip abroad, and I am sure he has many interesting things to tell us about the horses over there. TWENTY MILLION BELGIANS CANT BE WRONG MR. M. L. FLACK Mr. Chairman: Horse breeders are folks that- are interested in horses. You know Professor Gramlich has always been rather hard on me. I have always liked horses and he has been hard on me for that reason. This summer while I was over in England a fellow that knows Professor Gramlich well told me this story: Maybe you folks didn't know this, but Professor Gramlich used to be a policeman. He was heavier at that time and looked rather corpulent. One time a little boy came up to him and pushed him in the stomach and said: "Say, Pop, when are those pups gonna come? I have always liked police dogs and I' would like to get one." French Money Versus Belgian Money The subject of this talk is "Fifty Million Frenchmen Can't Be Wrong." I wish they could sometimes. I want to tell you a story of what happened, in France. I am going to try to keep to the horse sub - ject as much as possible. We were going from Belgium into France and when we got there we didn't have any Frefich money. The French won't accept any Belgian money, and it is worth more than French mcney. We had no money, but we secured a taxi and started down the street. We hadn't gone over two blocks until the taxi driver ran over a lady. The police came around and got the taxi driver and the lady. We did not know what to do. The sun was hot. and we sat there for about a half hour and then began to crawl out of the taxi. Another taxi drove up and about fifteen or twenty Frenchmen came along. The first one said, "Ycu are not going until you pay the ether taxi." I tried to tell the fellows the hotel that we were at and that they could collect there. But they did not want us to leave until we had paid. England Has Thin Steers We had many other experiences, and I want to tell you this one also. While we were over in England, the meat is not very good there. It is not like the meat Professor Loeffol fed us last night. Down in England we were on the Glasgow market watching the sale of steers. They drove them in' one at a time and auctioned them off about as fast as they could run them in. The butchers sat around buying. The steers were thin, just about like our feeders would be. The Scotchmen bought </seg>
            <seg id="p597">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATION them as fast as they were brought in, but we would probably have a hard time selling them the kind of steers we put on the market. Ate Horse Meat in Belgium When we got over to Belgium — this is a good story on Bill — we thought we were getting Holstein meat. We got big steaks and were enjoying them immensely. When we got through we asked the waiter what kind of meat it was. We wondered where they got Holstein meat A six mule team being driven as recommended in the Livestock Breeders' campaiicn for belter farm hitches. in that part cf the country. He said, "That isn't beef; you've been eat - ing horse meat." To make it all the worse, I asked him where he got those hcrses. He said they buy them over in the streets of England. Folks, after eating that horse meat I believe horses have a dual purpose. Over in Paris they have horse meat shops. Along the streets you will see a horse-eating sign outside and big carcasses hanging inside. Two Reasons for Good Horses in Scotland We seemed to get more information on horses in Scotland than in any other country. We met up with a man over there that sure showed us a good time. I must thank Professor Gramlich for putting us in touch with him. This man was David Adams, owner of the horse Junior Footprint. Mr. Adams took a whole day to show us around and he did it in a wonderful way. I asked Mr. Adams this question: "Why is it that you have so much interest in good horses over here?" He said there were two reasons. "In the first place, our power coming from </seg>

The quality and type is much better than ours all the way through. The Scotch have only pne horse, the Clydesdale; the French, Percherons, and the Bel - gians, Belgians. Breeding of Scotch Horses I am going to tell you more about the breeding of these Scotch horses. David Adams has one of the largest breeding establishments. He owns Junior Footprint, who was twenty years old in May. We were there in June. That horse moved up and down the road just like a colt. He was just as clean as a ribbon. You would take that horse to be eight or ten years old if you could see him. I asked Mr. Adams how he treated his breeding establishment. He keeps no mares of his own. He takes an option on all colts on December 31. They sell a 300-pound colt for $1500, and they have no trouble to sell these horse colts. They sell them in Canada and South America at good prices. Very rarely do you pay less than $7500 for a son of Junior Footprint You do not get our best horses. We have a few good Clydesdale sires that we will not sell. He showed us a son of Junior Footprint that has been champion at the Glasgow show. This horse looked as much like his sire as he could. All colts looked very much like their sires. The thing that has made this horse famous is that he puts his stamp on his sons and daughters. That horse was breeding eighty-five mares even at twenty years of age. He gets a good profit on colts. That alone was quite. a: revelation to me— that a horse that age and a horse that has done so well in that country could handle as many mares. Seventy per cent of the Clydesdale horses in Scotland trace to Junior Footprint. I am mentioning that horse, folks, because we got to see him. How the French Show Their Horses We didn't get to see very many French Percherons. The only time we got. to see any Percheron horses was a couple at the Royal Show. A thing that they do, and a thing that we should do also in showing a herd, for example, they don't take all their horses out of their barn - they take out three or four individuals. Mr. Adams was going to show a couple of horses. They get better ribbons showing two or thres horses than they get showing ten or twelve. As you can realize, when those men pick their stuff so close, you will know that their shows are very good. The percentage of good individuals is much higher there than in this country. "One Horse Farms" I mentioned the automobile power and the people's love for horses over in that country. They do with as little horse power as possible. They have to do that because they are short on feed, and they want to </seg>
            <seg id="p602">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE utilize their feed for feeding cattle, sheep, and other farm animals. They have a lot of so-called "one horse farms". That is, they have only one horse on the farm. Those horses are worked on a cart and haul tremendous loads of hay. They had one horse bringing in as much hay as we would have four horses attached to. In the agricultural schools here they hitch one horse to haul heavy loads and they do it in a fine way. Nearly all of the smaller farms have just one horse. Horses Used to Cultivate Potatoes They cultivate potatoes in France and Belgjum with horses. We found the rows closer together in Scotland than any place else, and I expected to find them closer there. They raise twenty tons of potatoes to the acre — about 750 bushels. They speak more in tons than we do in bushels. They have their horses trained to cultivate. I think big team hitches are a fine thing. I have noticed in this country, in going around over the state that we have a good number of horses on nearly all cf the farms, but they are not as good horses as they have over there. In this country it would be hard to go out and find as many gocd horses in the state. In that country if they get in a place where they need more horse power, they usually hitch a horse right ahead of the ether horse, and hook him to the horse collar. Breed Good Horses Fclks, I want to make you understand this. I should like to be able to give you more information on the way they breed their horses over there. We did another thing, too, while over there — I had to do some judging of cattle as well as horses. There is one thing I would like to see dene in Nebraska. I hope Nebraska comes back and breeds more horses and better horses than they have in the past. I thank you. THE COST OF POWER RALPH COLE Mr. Chairman: Some time ago when Mr. Waggener asked me to talk on the subject of horse cost, I told him there was very little definite information available on this subject. He stopped and looked at me a little bit, and then said, "That's fine, we won't have to listen to you very long." The thing that I told him in regard .to data and information on the subject of horse cost was true. We have in Nebraska no definite information en the exact cost of horse labor. We have some survey figures which have been carried on- by the U. S. Department of Agri- </seg>
            <seg id="p603">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATION culture, the state cooperative, which give some idea of what horse costs are and what they should be, but I have been obliged to look to some of the other surrounding states in order to find definite figures on the cost cf horse labor. I have put those figures on a chart (Shows chart.) I am not sure that I will be able to get this so that everyone of you can see it, but if there are any questions about the chart, I will be glad to answer them after the talk. In the states from which this study was taken the items which are most important are the cost of keeping the horse per year, that is, the ordinary work horse. You will notice that feed cost is the most. Feed Cost Varies Considerably Feed cost is probably the heaviest item of the cost cf horse labor, and in going over five states, you will notice that in South Dakota the average was something over $46, Iowa $61, Illinois $65, Wisconsin $65, and Colorado $50. In- going over this, I may say that the cost of feed varies quite consistently with about three or four different things. The first thing, perhaps, is with the amount of work. We all know it costs more to keep a horse up for 1000. hours than it would for 500; hours. Another thing which causes variances in the cost of feed is the cost of grain and hay during the particular year. It often happens that we find men who do not get their horses up in the spring very long before they start working them. They simply take them up out of the pasture and feed them a few days before they start work. Some men feed theirs six weeks before they start their spring work. High and Low Feed Costs I have taken figures here which show the high and low feed cost cf nineteen men who were in that particular study. We find that the men whose feed cost was low had $47 feed for the year, and the men whose feed cost was high had $127 worth of feed cost. This record was secured from actual figures kept by these nineteen men in one county in Illinois. How much feed do your horses eat during the year? I feel that these records, taken from actual farms where a daily and accurate figure was kept are more accurate than where survey figures were used. Man Labor The next item, perhaps, is man labor. You will notice that this varies frcm 211 hours in Illinois to 1181 in Iowa. A little over $13 in Illinois and $14 in. Wisconsin. That simply is the estimated labor value, not the labor used in caring for the horse during the time which that hcrse is working and all other labor which is necessary in order to care for the animal. We have a few figures showing the labor expended on </seg>
            <seg id="p604">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OK AGRICULTURE cne farm and the labor expended on another simply for the matter of keeping our data for the horse during the year. Depreciation Charges This miscellaneous column includes a few little items such as shoe - ing and others. So that in most cases here we have a cost of a little over $7 per year per horse for depreciation charges. That would run, say a horse that was valued at $85, a life of twelve years, would mean $7 per year. We find in some of these figures, however, that there is a variation. In the Illinois study the depreciation figures vary from nothing up to $7 per horse, and sometimes as high as $35 or $40 per horse. That, of course, is the condition where a man has only old horses on his farm. In a few cases here you will note depreciation and increase in the value of the horse. On a few of the farms that were Studied the horses were valued at a higher figure at the end of the year than they were at the beginning, which would tend, of course, to decrease the horse cost on that particular farm. Interest on Investment The other item which is of considerable importance is interest on investment. That figures from 3.93 in South Dakota to the high figure of 6.58 in Ohio. The average per cent figure used there is 5 per cent Of course, with a figure of 3.93, or approximately $4, the valuation there would be about $80. We find that in the Illinois study the figures all range up from $2 to $6.40. There was unquestionably a wide differ - ence m the valuation which these different men placed upon their horses Following is the total cost of keeping heavier breeds per year on the average, before any deductions had been made: South Dakota $ 92- oo J° wa ....:"!!:"! 102.00 " Inols , 112.50 Wisconsin 107 60 Colorado • 121.00 Not all of these figures took into consideration the fact that the horse is entitled to some credit In one case here we have an average 2L ™ nt " ln S ° Uth Dakota &gt; leavin * « net cost of $87 per year; Iowa $90; Illinois, $97; Wisconsin, $107, and in Colorado, $121. Figuring Total Hour Cost In order to get the hour cost per horse, it will be necessary for us to find the average number of hours which the horses worked in that locahty. By dividing the total cost by the number of hours we get the total hour cost. In doing that you will notice here that the average </seg>
            <seg id="p605">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATION figure in South Dakota was a little over 800; Iowa, 800; Wisconsin, 700; Colorado, 900. We have been using in this state the figure 800 hours as the average, and I think that on most cornbelt farms that will practically hit the average. In going further we find here the average cost per hour. It is hard to tell which one of these states is most closely comparable to Nebraska, because we have so much variation in Ne - braska. With Nebraska closer to Iowa and Colorado, and in a degree to Illinois, of course the figure would not be so much in Wisconsin be - cause it is a little farther away from us. Again we have a range in cost which is rather outstanding. In the South Dakota figures I find that the range per farm from low to high in cost per hour of horse labor runs from .06 to .16% per hour. In the matter of feed, the range runs from $24 to $60, so that there is so much variation in this thing that after all we did before we haven't been able to draw any really definite conclusions as to just exactly what the cost of horse labor is. There is a lot of room for improvement with the idea in mind of cutting down horse labor cost. Horses Versus Tractors The other side of this question, the tractor question, I decided not to discuss here at all. I simply have put before you figures which tend to show what the experience has been with regard to horse cost in the states surrounding us. So many factors enter into this that it is very difficult to say whether horses or tractors would be more satisfactory. The thing that stands out in my mind is that the chief factors in gov - erning this are cost of horse labor and the number of hours which the p£% % ■E^^^'^-W^' - ~ A calf at creep on F. L.

            <seg id="p606">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE horse is used during the year. In the management of the farm it is important to plan that farm in such a way that its horses can be used a maximum number of hcurs during the year. It is also true of man labor. In conclusion, then, I would draw from that study that decrease in the per hour cost of horse labor could probably be brought about more easily and more effectively by that means than by any other way. I thank you. •The motion picture film, "Big Teams and Their Use on Cornbelt Farms," was shown here. It showed many things which probably could not have been brought cut in speeches of any kind. The annual meeting of the Nebraska Improved Live Stock Breeders' Association was held at noon in the Judging Pavilion. The detail of this meeting can be had by reading the minutes of that meeting at the close. CATTLE-PASTURE PROGRAM W. W.

HOG PROGRAM DAN HILDEBRAND, CHAIRMAN Folks, we are going to start the hog program this morning with a hog tattooing demonstration. The two boys who are going to give this demonstration are from Saunders county, and they can certainly show us how if anyone ' can, as they are the champion demonstration team and have given several tattooing demonstrations over the state. The team: The demonstration was very effective and the boys were asked many questions. They showed exactly .how .it was done and explained to the men the advantages of having hogs tattooed and also the advan - tages of living in an accredited county. MR. HILDEBRAND: The tuberculosis question has been one of great concern in our state and many other states as well. We have </seg>
            <seg id="p607">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATION people working in our state, trying to help us eradicate tuberculosis in our live stock, and I am now going to call on Dr. Spencer, who is going to talk en "Has the Tattoo Solved the T. B. Question?" ■■■'.■■ i • .. HAS THE TATTOO SOLVED THE T. B. QUESTION? DR. SPENCER Ladies and Gentlemen: Chancellor Burnett, at the banquet the other night for the Master Farmers, made the statement that he was impressed and believed that any problem could be solved if we could just get the people interested in it and explain to the people what the problem was. I think that was certainly a true statement. We found that thing true in most every line of disease control that we have had to deal with. I am quite sure that there is no other disease that that particular thing has been better shown in than it has been in the control and the eradication of tuberculosis. Introduction of Bill Into Legislature Abcut ten years ago, I think it was, there was introduced into the legislature of Nebraska a bill asking for an appropriation of $75,000 to be used for this work. It was to be used in cooperation with the U. S. Department of Agriculture. That bill passed the legislature, I think, almost unanimously. As I remember, it was signed with an emergency clause. Every succeeding biennium the legislature has found that same problem before them and they have readily approved the program. Not only has the legislature approved the plan for appro - priating funds each session, but the people have very definitely accepted the plan that was outlined and presented to them by taking advantage of it. We have in Nebraska, at the present time, I think, forty-one or forty-two counties that have qualified under the state law of Nebraska. How Counties May Become Accredited If the time permitted I would be very happy to review this part of the program, .but the time is short and we will not take the time to discuss this part right now. I think perhaps the majority of you know the situation under which any county may take advantage of this co - operative plan for the control and eradication of tuberculosis. This report here shows the counties that have accepted the plan. (Shows report.) The total number shows the counties that have completed the test and who have been accorded as free from cattle tuberculosis. I think there are thirty-one of those counties. Now, as I stated before, I think that is very good substantial evidence of the fact that the people at large, both the producer and the. consuming public, have seen the value of this work and have lent their assistance and help to get it </seg>
            <seg id="p608">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE established in their communities. I referred to the consuming public in connection with this. I think we have had as hearty support from that class as we have had from the producing: side, because it is a ques - tion of just how information not only economically, but from the human standpoint as well, and for that reason we have had their support. Condemned Cattle Carcasses Reduced from 5600 to 1000 The year preceding the passage of this bill, at the appropriation of that first amount of money by the state of Nebraska, we had at the Omaha market, I think, in the neighborhood of 14,000 cattle retained by the government inspectors for tuberculosis. During that same year we had about 5600 carcasses — the entire carcasses being condemned. Now it depends upon the extent of the infection and the. condition of the carcass when it is inspected by the government inspectors as to the disposition of the carcass. Those carcasses that carry a generalized case of tuberculosis — the entire carcass is condemned. We had at that time in the neighborhood of 5600 condemned carcasses. The last year, 1928, less than 1000 condemned carcasses. I am giving you these figures to give you some information as to what has been accomplished in the eradication of tuberculosis in cattle. Chart Shows Number of Condemned Hog Carcasses The number of cattle that were infected had been increasing each year up until this work had started. Not only in cattle, but the same condition prevailed in hogs." This was not only at the Omaha market here, but all of the cornbelt markets were in the same position. They were passed by the same laws that we were in Omaha. In 1922 the high peak was reached in hogs being retained for tuberculosis. I pre - pared a little chart here that will show you the per cent of hogs that were found affected by the government inspectors at the Omaha market for the years 1922, 1925, and 1928; by months. We have kept a report of each hog slaughtered and the inspector's report on it. (Shows chart.) In 1928, we had 11.4 per cent infection last year. We had 5311 hog carcasses condemned for tuberculosis as compared with 11,363 in 1922. As you notice, that is a very marked reduction. With these figures, taking the savings on just condemned carcasses, we have there 7566 hog carcasses saved on the same basis providing the infection had been the same as it was in 1922, not allowing for any increase which would have appeared without any question had the program not been in operation. We had 7566 carcasses at a saving of say $20 per head, which is a very low estimation for this past year. That makes $47,320, and added to the 5319 condemned carcasses which I spoke to you about before, we would get a' saving of $258,180, the total amounting to $405,500. That is a saving on these two items alone — condemned car- </seg>
            <seg id="p609">' NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS.' ASSOCIATION casses of cattle and hogs. That is considered low, and those retained for tuberculosis are not condemned. Many of those carcasses are slight cases and in many of them only the head of the carcass is condemned. There has been a marked reduction in the number of hogs retained at these markets. You will see from 16.67 there to 11.4 makes a differ - ence of several thousand hogs, probably in the neighborhood of 100,000 hogs. Now I have briefly reviewed this part of the program so that you could get a more definite and a clearer understanding if possible, of the results that have followed the campaign for the eradication of tubercu - losis in Nebraska. I refer to Nebraska in particular, but the program has been in operation in all of the other states in the Union and like results have been obtained in most of the other states. What about the tattoo problem ? The question here was, has this solved the tuberculosis problem? No, we do not feel that it has solved the tuberculosis . problem but we do think and believe that it is a dis - tinct aid in this program. The whole business of the tattoo is to iden - tify the hogs back to the farm from which it was raised, and the rea - son for wanting that is to be able to trace back any infectious disease that is found in the market. This does not only apply to tuberculosis but it will apply to any other infectious disease, or by applying this tattoo, in case we desire to go back to the farm- to find out where the hogs were raised in case we have an unusually good type carcass, lard type of hog or anything unusual about the killings. I am free to admit here that when this program was discussed, it was continued a number of years before any effort was made to put it into operation. I am free to admit that I was opposed to the program because I did not believe that it could be put into practical operation very easily. I felt that the obstacles in the way would probably offset any of the advantages that might come from it. But after six years of operation here in Nebraska and other states, I am convinced that it is practical and that it is valuable. There are a number of things that enter into it that make it difficult to put it in operation and to get it well established in these counties, but these things are being over - come and we are approaching success in the undertaking. First Asked for Certificates - I may add that the reason for our putting it into operation was the fact that we were getting so many hogs at the various market centers from accredited counties, that it was impractical to try to kill those lots separately any more. We started out asking a certificate from these hogs and killed the hogs in separate lots and kept their </seg>
            <seg id="p610">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE identity on the killing floor. But that became such a big problem that we couldn't continue it. . The first six months one-third of all of the hogs that came into the Omaha markets came from accredited counties. It is a big problem to try to keep them separate. 85 Per Cent of the Hogs Show Good Tattooes The tattoo- program went into effect July 1st, for the reason that I have stated. Since that time we have killed 100,000 hogs. We wers very skeptical when the regulations were put into effect, whether or not we could induce the farmers to tattoo their hogs, and if we did induce him to tattoo his hogs if he would do a job that would show results. We have found from a very complete record of all of these hogs, that a very large per cent of hogs after the first month or two of instruction, have been coming through in good shape. Probably 85 per cent, I think even more than that at some of the packing houses, show good, legible markings. That is a great deal better than any of us who had anything to do with the program expected. We felt that if we. got 50 per cent legibility we would be doing very well to start with. Method of Tattooing It is very important to carry out this program, as was demon - strated so well here by these boys. If we do not, we will not get the results we are looking for. In the first place it is necessary to have the right kind of mixture on your needles. We have found lamp black mixed with linseed oil to a thick, sticky paste to be good. Apply to your instrument and hit the hogs a good, stiff quick slap on the point of the shoulder and you will be quite apt to get a good, legible marking so all of the letters show. The instrument must be held level and you must hit the hog so that each number will go into the skin. The skin is rather hard to penetrate. Do not fear that you will bruise the carcass for you will not. The possibility is that the needle takes the blow and prevents the instrument from bruising the skin. Whenever you handle it in that way you will get results. The people have accepted this in very good spirits. The purpose was ' to trace back in - fection. We have followed the system of notifying each individual 'as to the results of his inspection. We have' received a very hearty re - sponse, from most of those individuals. We have two letters received from prominent, hog producers both in Nebraska and Iowa, commend - ing the program and expressing their appreciation for the fact that we were trying to help them clean up this infection on their farms. Purpose of Program I want to leave this thought with you, if you get no other thought at all. The program is intended for no other purpose than the eradi- </seg>
            <seg id="p611">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS 1 ASSOCIATION cation of tuberculosis. The premium is being paid with the idea that the hogs are of more value to the packers. It is also being paid with the hopes that it will stimulate interest in helping to get the people to realize that tuberculosis is a very serious problem, and that some system must be continued that will help clean up the localities where there is infection. Tuberculosis in Poultry The poultry problem in Nebraska presents a little different prob - lem than the cattle tuberculosis did. We have, no doubt, a great deal more tuberculosis in chickens than we have in cattle. Just how to handle that has been a very grave problem. The facts are that none of us have been able to work out any definite plan or program for taking care of it. At the present time we feel that an educational program is the best way of approaching it. Whenever we find an infected flock or if we are told of one, the owner is advised of the fact that his flock is infected, and in giving you this statement — that there has never been a hog or poultry flock come to the market en - titled to the premium that did not get it. There are a great number of cases of hogs that come in that claim the. premium and sometimes we find that they are not entitled to that premium at all. We have had cases where the premium was paid and later have found out that the hogs were shipped in from other states. It is absolutely necessary in this program to have some understanding and that pertains to both the producer and the packer. I know in Omaha we have paid into Nebraska counties 350,000 more premiums than we have record of. The possibility is that at least one-half milllion dollars have been paid into Nebraska from accredited counties. I thank you. QUESTION: Do they have to test the hogs out when they get there? ANSWER: No, but the possibilities are that in the near future there will be a legislature requiring that none of them be condemned for tuberculosis and that probably 50 per cent reduction or more will render them ineligible for the premium. Now the premium is paid on the basis of the hogs being bred and fed in the counties and the hogs are tattooed and have a certificate. The facts are that the hogs are coming out not more than 5 cents above the regular run of hogs. QUESTION: Is there any advantage of getting the premium on shipments that go through Omaha and on .to Chicago and other markets? </seg>
            <seg id="p612">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ANSWER: Yes. Regardless of where they go they will get the premium. The premium is now being paid back to the farmer and producer. MR. HILDEBRAND: Unfortunately our next speaker, Mr. Honor Oschner of Madison, finds it impossible to be with us this morning. Since Mr. Oschner cannot be here, I am going to call on Mr. Waggener, the secretary of the pig crop contest, to tell us something about this important feature of the Nebraska Improved Livestock Breeders Asso - ciation's activities during the past year. Mr. Waggener: ■ WHAT THE PIG CROP CONTEST TEACHES O. O. WAGGENER Ladies and Gentlemen: It is indeed too bad that our good friend Mr. Oschner found it necessary to be absent today. In his absence I am going to try to give you as good a summary as I can of last year's pig crop contest. In talking to Mr. Oschner about how he was able to produce an average of 1,608 pounds of pork from each of the ten sows on, his farm, he made these two significant statements: "I used a colony hog house and kept it well cleaned. The pigs were allowed to get out on clean ground soon after farrowing." Mr. Oschner is the winner of the Nebiaska 1928 pig crop contest over 63 other entrants, from all parts of the state. His feed and labor' cost was $7.21 per hundred pounds of pork produced. Mr. Oschner's record is one in which good management in every detail of swine production is evident. He used purebred Poland China sows, bred them to a purebred Duroc boar and found the cross to be a good one. The sows were fed a well balanced ration, farrowed in cleaned houses, and kept on clean ground. THe pigs were vaccinated against cholera, kept on clean ground and were naturally free of disease. They also were fed well balanced rations and given free access, to pasture. "The two things I learned of most importance were that death loss at birth must be prevented and the hogs must be marketed at the right time if a profit is to be made," said Mr. Oschner in review - ing his results. "The ten sows farrowed 96 pigs and raised 78. That is a loss of 18 pigs or more than 18 per cent. Most of this loss could have been prevented by having guard rails around the pens to keep the sows from laying on the pigs. Also, I would have had 500 bushels, more corn now and $300 more money for the pigs if I had sold them. </seg>
            <seg id="p613">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATION ■ ■ ■ in the middle of September instead of holding for a later but lower market." Hogs do not take all of Mr. Oschner's time. Not only is he a champion hog man, but he is a champion all around farmer and com - munity booster as well. Since graduating from the Nebraska College of Agriculture in 1925, he has not only made a place for himself with his Hereford cattle and other farming operations, but he has also given his community valuable service as Baby Beef Club leader. In 1927, calves fed in accordance with his recommendations won both grand champion steer and grand champion heifer at the Omaha Club Show. In 1928, one of the boys in his club won both grand champion steer and heifer in the club classes at the Nebraska State Fair. At the recent Ak-Sar-Ben show his boys again exhibited their good training by winning champion Hereford and reserve champion of the show. When in college Honor Oschner was a member of the university livestock judging team which won the championship at the Denver show in the winter of 1924. The next fall the same team won second place in judging contests at the National Swine Show and at the American Royal Show at Kansas City. They wound up the season by winning the national championship at the International Livestock Show and Mr. Oschner placed fourth among all individuals in the big contest. Of the 64 hog men who entered, only eight finished the contest with an average of over 1,200 pounds of pork per sow. These men will each receive a document of recognition from the College of Agri - culture and a seal of approval from the Nebraska Improved Livestock Breeders' Association. To those who averaged 1,200 to 1,300 pounds of pork per sow a gold seal will be given. Those averaging 1,300 to 1,400 pounds of pork per sow will receive a red seal and those above 1,400 pounds will receive a blue seal. C. F. Eshelman of Webster county has been a consistent winner in pig crop contests since their beginning three years ago. In 1926, he placed second with 1,681 pounds of pork per sow. In 1927, he placed second with 1,570 pounds per litter and now, in the 1928 con - test, he places seventh with 1,269 pounds of pork per sow. All of which proves that it is not merely a matter of chance with Mr. Eshel - man. He must really know how to raise hogs. </seg>

            <seg id="p615">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATION But what does this contest teach us? Or does it have a lesson? We believe it does. Is it not significant that since the first contest was conducted three years ago no winner of the contest has eve? lost pigs from filth born diseases? Without exception, they have seen to it that their sows and pens and pastures were sufficiently clean to prevent losses from such diseases as necro, worms, bull nose, rhinitis, sore throat, mange, etc. A review of the rations of the winners during these same years fails to reveal a single man who did not feed a well balanced ration. If this contest proves anything it is that poorly balanced rations (straight corn and no protein supplement, etc.) have no place in the hog lots of up-to-date men. Moreover, there were no cholera losses. To a man they vacci - nated against this dread disease wherever it appeared at all neces - sary.

A light ration of highly digestible feed and plenty of clean drinking water were kept convenient to the hogs and no one was allowed to disturb them. As a result, weight losses and mortality from this disease were extremely low. Did they select sows that came from large litters? Yes, and this fact combined with careful breeding and feeding resulted in their sows bringing large healthy litters of thrifty pigs without which it would have been impossible for them to have attained this coveted goal. </seg>

Loeffel cf the Nebraska Agricultural College, has a message which I am sure will be of interest to all those present. Professor Loeffel will talk on "Feeding the Brood Sow." FEEDING THE BROOD SOW WM. J. LOEFFEL One of the important considerations in feeding the bred sow is the kind and amount of feed given. The foundation of the ration should be composed of farm-grown grains. These are important because of their ready availability and comparative cheapness. It is recognized, how - ever, that these grains are deficient in protein and mineral matter, and it is a matter for the intelligent hog man to balance his ration of farm-grown grains with a protein supplement of one kind or another. There are many feeds which may be used to supplement a grain ration, chief among which are the dairy by-products, the packing house by-products, mill feeds, and oil mill by-products. Fortunate indeed is the man who has' an adequate supply of skim - milk to meet the protein requirements of his hogs. We ordinarily figure that 100 pounds of ski mm ilk is worth one-half: the. price of corn per bushel for balancing up a grain ration. Undiluted buttermilk is equivalent to skimmilk in feeding value. Commercial buttermilk feeds such as condensed and powdered buttermilk are very satisfactory, but frequently costly when used as a source of protein in the ration. Because of its availability, tankage is one of the most commonly used supplements. Its cost has increased in recent years, but it is still within the price range which makes it an economical feed for brood sews. The Iowa Experiment Station has demonstrated that the feeding of tankage to brood sows increases the average size of the litter, the average size of the pigs at birth, and the per cent, of strong pigs over a corn alone ration. </seg>
            <seg id="p619">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATION Mill By-products Excellent Hog Feeds The mill by-products, shorts in particular, are excellent hogr feeds. Bran is valuable for feeding the brood sow in that it supplies protein and is laxative in its action. I should hardly recommend the use of shorts as a sole protein supplement to balance the grain ration for sows. Linseed meal is a valuable hog feed in that it supplies protein and is laxative in nature. As a sole source of protein it is disappointing. However, where blended with other feeds, it has proved very desirable indeed. A mixture of 3 parts of tankage and 1 part of oil meal, by weight, has proved superior to straight tankage at this experiment station. We have also had excellent results from cottonseed meal when blended with tankage. A mixture of cottonseed meal and tankage, equal parts, has proved to be one of our most efficient supplements at this station. Another blend which we like very much is 2 parts of tankage, 1 part of linseed meal or cottonseed meal, and 1 part of alfalfa meal. . One of the very excellent feeds for brood sows is leafy alfalfa hay. This feed not only supplies considerable protein, but mineral matter as well. For those who have alfalfa hay, I should recommend keeping a rack full before the sows during the gestation period. As to the amount of feed for brood sows, it is difficult to say. Much will depend upon the age of the sow and the amount of flesh she is carrying. Gilts must be fed a stronger ration than mature sows in order that they may complete their growth. Thin sows naturally re - quire more feed than fleshy ones. A safe rule to follow is that the sow should gain in weight during the gestation period and yet not be fat at farrowing time. Another important consideration in the management of the bred sow is the matter of exercise. The hog man has an opportunity to exercise considerable ingenuity in forcing his brood sows to exercise during the winter months. If the weather is not too severe, the brood sews may be forced to exercise by feeding at some distance from their sleeping quarters. Another means would be to feed in different corners of the lot, feeding in one corner, watering in another, and placing the sleeping quarters in still • another portion of the lot; thus, forcing the sows to move from place to place during the course of the day. r . '■ MR. HILDEBRAND: There have been a number of questions arise regarding the control of mange and necro in swine. Before proceeding with the regular program, I am going to ask Dr. Alford of the state </seg>
            <seg id="p620">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE scrum plant to discuss these important diseases for the benefit of those who have inquired regarding: them. Dr. Alford then gave a short and very concise discussion which was especially well taken. Considerable interest was evidenced and numerous questions asked and ably answered. MR. HILDEBRAND: The next speaker is one whom you have been looking forward to hearing ever since you first received notice of this program. Professor Turner Wright of the South Dakota College of Agriculture at Brookings delivered us a very able and interesting dis - cussicn on the Breeding of Tail-less Sheep for our Tuesday afternoon meeting. I know you are all anxious to hear him again. His topic this morning is "What About Barley as a Hog Feed?" Mr. Wright: WHAT ABOUT BARLEY AS A HOG FEED? TURNER WRIGHT The question of feeding barley to hogs is growing more important every year, not only in the Northwest, not only in our state, but if we may judge from the number of inquiries that come to us from neighboring states, it is also a question of importance in neighboring states. Barley growing, I think, is increasing from some three or four different causes. Your chairman, Mr. Hildebrand, has already men - tioned one of those. The problem of securing some grain crop that could be used in the rotation in the place of oats, which would probably have a higher feeding value or a higher selling value than oats. A second reason why barley feeding and barley growing is becoming more important in our country is that it is a dependable crop. It is a crop that comes on with the early spring rains and matures before the drouth sets in in the latter part of July and August, and very often produces for us a higher yield than does coin. In some of the more northern sections, each barley crop is out of the way before frost. Then there is still another important reason why barley growing is becoming important. Different types of hogs are going on the market today. Just a few days ago I heard a representative of one of the packers say that barley was becoming more and more important to them as a hog fattener, because of the fact that the hogs were of an entirely different type. Corn Borer Affects Barley There is the question of the corn borer consistently coming up, and I hope the time will never come when the corn borer will be a </seg>
            <seg id="p621">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATION menace to this section of the country. We know that the corn borer does affect barley only in close proximity to the corn fields. Barley Ready Before Corn Now still another important reason for this growing interest in feeding barley is that the barley is ready for the hogs, ready for the cattle, some four to six weeks ahead of the corn crop. It furnishes a source of new crop grain at a time when new crop grain is scarce. The problem of keeping down the cost of production is one of the most important things in making the hog industry pay the right kind of dividends. The other important thing has been mentioned here this morning, and that is making each sow in the herd produce the maximum number of strong, healthy pigs. We heard a great deal the other night at the Master Farmer ban - quet about building a home and making the old places attractive to the young people. That is as it should be. Every farm home in this country ought to become such that every boy. and girl raised therein always will have a happy memory of it. If we could have every farm home in this country one of that type, I think perhaps the man who wrote this little verse entitled "I Heard the Voice of the City Calling Again and Again," might not have written it. Every farmer who is growing hogs has in his mind the making and the providing of that home. Have Fed Barley for Nine Years at South Dakota I want to take up in this barley feeding some of the things that make for economy. At the South Dakota Experiment Station we have been feeding barley consistently for about nine years. We have found barley an excellent feed for growing stock pigs, and for producing young bred gilts. We find that the stock pigs grown on barley make good growth, they develop into stretchy pigs, and develop the type that is essential in a stock pig to go into the feed lot and make the cheapest gains. We have found that the results of feeding barley can be very favorable, so far as cost is concerned, with feeding corn as the basic ration. Last winter I fed a bunch of brood sows on a ration made up by mixing 8 parts of tankage, 4 parts of linseed oil meal and 38 parts of ground barley together. I fed one-half of the ration of that mixture and one-half of shelled corn, and the sows had free access to good quality alfalfa hay fed in a rack. .We also fed one bunch of sows shelled corn, tankage and alfalfa hay. . We fed another bunch of sows on ground oats and alfalfa hay. Still another bunch we fed on ground oats, ground barley, and alfalfa. Of all that group of sows, those that got the first mixture produced the strongest, and most thrifty pigs of any of the other groups. </seg>
            <seg id="p622">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Barley Compared to Corn First I am going to give the summaries of seven different experi - ments in which we have compared corn with barley as a feed for fatten - ing hogs. Hardly :i day goes by but what I get two or three letters asking me to give them the value of barley as compared to corn for feeding fattening hogs. We very often .hear a man say that a hog will fatten on barley as quickly as he will on corn, but it takes a longer time to fatten hogs on barley than it does on corn. The length of time re - quired was practically the same. . In fattening a pig from 74 pounds up to 228 pounds it took 98.2 days for the corn-fattened hogs and 98.84 days for the barley-fattened hogs, almost the identical length of time. The method of feeding used in this experiment was to feed the corn in one self-feeder, a mixture of tankage and oil meal in another self - feeder, and letting the hogs have access to alfalfa hay in a rack. We used Trinity mixture also. We used it in only about two or three ex - periments. We quit using it for this reason: we found that our pigs did not make enough gain on that mixture to pay for the extra;' cost of chopping or grinding the hay. We found, also, that the pigs in en - deavoring to get the oil meal and tankage rooted out a high per cent of that feed and wasted a lot of it. We have obtained decidedly good litters from that mixture. A question comes up, barley is high in protein. Why use protein supplements? Is it not better to use the feeds grown on the farm? We have found it best, and I think it is always a mighty good proposition for the farmer, or any other man, to go into the thing that makes him the most money. At our station cheapest gains and there the most money has been made by the use of some good supplement. That is why I recommend it. You will notice one thing, and that is the feed consumption of barley as compared with corn. You will read a: lot of articles that will tell you that barley is not so good as corn, but we found that the pigs actually ate more barley per day than they did of corn per day. In other words, we found the barley very palatable. Another statement that we often hear made is that if pigs run to a self-feeder of barley and tankage, they will eat too much of the tankage, and eat more of the tankage than would a similar group of hogs running to a self - feeder of corn and tankage. Our experiments have not borne out that conclusion. (Shows charts.) The figures here show the total con - sumption to be .39 pound per day for the corn-fed lots, against .28 pound per day for the barley-fed lota. Fall Pigs Better Money-Makers Than Spring Pigs We have been able to make more money from our fall pigs than we have from our spring pigs, because they take less work at farrow - ing time and sell on a higher market. If we would figure corn at 70 </seg>
            <seg id="p623">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATION cents per bushel, a value of $3.50 ptr hundred on the oil meal, then the value of 100 pounds of barley would, be just 95 per cent, $1.18, of the value of shelled corn. But the cost of grinding is to be deducted from that. Methods of Feeding Barley There comes a question of the method of feeding barley. We have fed soaked barley and ground barley. Our results indicated that it always pays to feed the ground barley. We fed it dry to our stock pigs, and we fed it in a self-feeder. I have some figures here which show the results of our experiments and I will take them up next. That comes to the question of whether or not it pays to put the tankage in a self-feeder or limit it. This is a summary of three years' work in which hogs have been fed barley in a self-feeder and tankage in a self-feeder. In other words, the tankage consumption for one week should be taken as a guide for the amount of tankage to be put in that feeder for the following week. (Shows chart.) Summing the whole thing up, putting it on the same scale, we find that every 100 pounds of gain where the feed of tankage was limited was 66 cents less per hundred than the 100 pounds of gain made on the other hogs. We are continuing that series of experiments and we have a bunch of hogs on feed now, but I don't know what is going to happen. This is. the average of three years' work and consistently the results are just the same. I am afraid our pigs are going to tell another story. Results of Three-year Average Close Now, then, right along with that other work we have been carrying on a series of experiments to find out whether or not it really pays to add this oil meal to the tankage. In other words, does it pay to take out part of the tankage and self -feed a little bit of oil meal? Barley carries a higher percentage of protein than does corn. I have given you our summary of three years' work in fattening hogs on a ration of ground barley and tankage, self-fed; and a ration of corn, and a protein mixture of tankage 2 parts and oil meal 1 part, self-fed. You will notice that the results of the average of three years' work are very, very close. It required 104 days to fatten the corn-fed hogs for market, while the hogs getting ground barley and the oil meal mixture took 111 days. In other words, there was about seven days' time in favor of those not getting the oil meal. The average daily gain was 1.54 and 1.57, re - spectively. It required 407 pounds of feed for the hogs fed the tankage, and 401.43 pounds for those getting the tankage and oil meal. There was a little bit of saving in the barley. There was a higher protein requirement where they had the oil meal mixed with the tankage. Using the figure of 1.18 per 100 pounds for the ground barley, $4 per 100 for tankage, and $3.50 per 100 for the linseed meal, we have 100 pounds </seg>
            <seg id="p624">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE gain of those fed the tankage, oil meal and ground barley supplement of $5.80. There is a margin of 10 cents in favor of the hogs getting the tankage without the oil meal. I will say that we have some summer-fed hogs and some winter-fed hogs. In the winter, the tankage alone and the tankage-oil meal fed hogs just about broke even. In the summer, then, in the hogs fed on the tankage and oil meal, the oil meal was an absolute waste. Now if there are any questions, I shall be glad to try to answer them for you. ■■.'-.■ .-'•■■ T. :.■■■■. QUESTION: Did you ever raise any barley that the hogs wouldn't eat? ANSWER: No, sir. We have never had any barley that the hogs wouldn't eat. I will say that I am not as well posted as I might be on that subject I find that there has been barley shipped in from Canada which was infected with f be disease called scab. Hogs will not eat this, but cattle will. QUESTION: Do you use beardless barley? ANSWER: No, sir, we have never used beardless barley. QUESTION: Does it pay to grind barley? ANSWER: I would always recommend grinding barley. MR. HILDEBRAND: Professor Wright, the evidence in the case is with you. You have struck a note of no small importance to the average hog feeder in this state. Our production of barley is on the increase. Barley is a fairly safe crop and a good yielder with us. Your discussion has shown us very clearly how we can use this barley to advantage. Our next speaker hails from Bridgeport, out in the west end of Nebraska: He was a winner in this year's pig crop contest, is a careful record keeper, and a leader in his community. His experiments will be a lesson of value to each and every one of us. Mr. Sweet: </seg>

The subject assigned to me— "What Sanitation Did for My Hogs"— rT', 1 " 81 * y ° U&gt; X teke gives me ful1 license to "&gt;ake this talk a great deal more personal than good form and modesty would otherwise permit— so I feel justified in making this a story of my search for high standards and best practices in swine husbandry and, when found, how I endeavored to best apply them to my own situation-and the results tnereirom. My preparation for this phase of animal husbandry was but theo - retical, as previous training had been along industrial lines-but I be - heved business management could be applied to pork production for I determined from my study of the results obtained by successful pork producers, as well as from experiments of the Agricultural Col - leges, that success was apparently dependent upon two fundamental requirements, the first of which is A FUNDAMENTAL REQUIREMENTS .1. LARGE THRIFTY LITTERS of pigs 2. with INHERITED ABILITY to make 3. from the LEAST FOOD 4. with MINIMUM MAN LABOR —100 POUNDS. OF PORK. The second requirement B to have PIGS FINISHED and READY TO MARKET during HIGHEST PRICE MONTHS OF YEAR. I will now tell you how I took this first requirement, section by section, and reduced it from a generality to concrete figures, upon 09a) . </seg>
            <seg id="p626">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ■I which to base an objective, in this, my first experiment in hog produc - tion for profit. Now, what are large litters? At the top end of the production scale I found that there were many whom, in contests, made ton litters, or even more, in a limited time. I visualized this as a litter of 10 pigs weighing 200 pounds each. At the other end I found that the estimated Nebraska average was 800-pound litters at six months of age, which meant to me litters of 5 pigs weighing 160 pounds each. Analysis of the report of the 1927 Nebraska Pig Litter Contest disclosed that the first thirty averaged 1030-pound litters of 6.2 pigs weighing 167 pounds each. Thus it seemed that seven pigs saved should be about the num - ber for which I must strive. Inherited Ability — I found in my study of experimental feeding tests of equally thrifty pigs, that certain strains in the different breeds consumed from, under 300 to over 500 pounds of grain to make 100 pounds of pork. This meant that with $1.00 corn, a 200-pound shote could vary from $10.80 to $18.00, a difference of $7.20 in grain costs alcne. Why such a difference? The feeding of unbalanced rations could account for perhaps half, but there was still some $3.20 worth of wasted food to be eliminated. I concluded that this must be done through skillful feeding of pigs who had this inherited ability to make rapid and cheap gains. Upon further investigation, I concluded that this inherited low food characteristic was a breeding problem, involving expert knowledge of genetics, keeping detailed records and the ability on the part of the breeder to select most promising individuals for his breeding herd. (I fumbled here in that I made no determined effort to secure my seed stock from such a breeder, but bought what I thought was the best available, and I am going to confess that they were just good grade stock.) Permit me to digress here to say that this phase is just beginning to receive expert attention from breeders and experiment stations, Iowa having started this year, feeding testa in cooperation with breed - ers, to find these quick finishing strains and will, I think, carry their experiments to the limit, in that they will also determine slaughtering values of these strains. So I wonder if I am not safe in predicting that within a few years one can purchase his breeding individuals with every assurance that if properly cared for' their progeny will make a good deal more than 200 pounds of pork in six months. Until that "consumation so devoutly to be wished" really occurs, it seems to be up to each of us to make the most from what we have. Now let us come back to the third section — Period of Time. Six months seems to be the length of time adopted by the Agricultural </seg>
            <seg id="p627">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS 1 ASSOCIATION Colleges as the finishing time limit in their various contests, for the reason, I presume, that test after test has shown that the more quickly a pig is finished, the more profitable he is. So I chose to accept, tem - porarily at least, their standard of time, in spite of the fact that some producers were making 200 pounds in about five months. We now reach section 4 — Least Amount of Feed. When discussing section 2, you will remember that I found a variation of from 300 to 500 pounds of grain necessary to produce 100 pounds of pork, so I just "split the difference" and set my standard at 400 pounds. Here we are to the fifth and last section of the first requirement- Minimum of Man Labor. Search for some standard to apply to this most important part of the industry, where man labor costs and counts . for so much, led to disappointment, as the best I could find were gen - eralities, principally to the effect that, after labor saving devices were supplied and conveniently placed, the problem was a matter of routine tasks well and quickly performed. Of the labor saving devices, I adopted for shelter the A-type individual house; for feeding, the self - feeder; for water I took a chance and used an irrigation ditch, with, •however, P um P and tank ready for emergency. Let us now analyze my second requirement — "Have pigs finished and ready for market during the highest price months of the year." I found that sows could be bred practically at the will of the operator, and gestation tables being available, a moment's study would inform mo the dates of breeding necessary to have the pigs come at about whatever date desired. When, then, are the highest price market months? Statistics show them to be highest in September and next highest in late June and early July, so I planned my breeding dates to farrow in late February and early March for the September market and to farrow in late November and early December for the June-July mar - ket (See Note.) I am going to digress here to tell you how I fumbled and had pigs come from March 24th to May 15th, a spread of fifty days instead of a possible fourteen to twenty-one days. This set my finishing date back to October 15th, with fairly sure prospects of getting on a declining market. Well, I surely did, about $2.50 per hundred or $5.00 per head, nearly $1,000.00 on my crop of pigs. Figures (statistics) did NOT lie in this instance. Speaking of long-drawn-out farrowing dates, I can tell you of a neighbor who ran his boar with a herd of twenty-four sows and has just recently had twenty-one of them farrow an average of eight thrifty pigs in a period of five days. Now, let's recapitulate the*standards and practices I have imposed upon myself: seven pigs per litter, weighing 200 pounds at six months </seg>
            <seg id="p628">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE of age, consuming 800 pounds of grain and ready for market in Sep - tember. These standards, which seemed to me so necessary of accom - plishment if I was to succeed in the pork production business, were known — or at least available — to all producers, so we must now look for the reasons why all are not making pork in 'the volume, in the period of time and within the feed limits as outlined. Investigation disclosed that large litters were the rule rather than the exception — but, the saving to maturity of . thrifty pigs was the limiting factor, so why are so many pigs lost or their thrift retarded? A good many are killed in their nests, a few later from crowding, acci - dent or natural. causes, but by far the greatest number die or are hope - lessly set back by disease and parasites induced by filthy feeding yards, pastures, water supply, farrowing quarters, as well as by dark, damp, sun-proof and draughty sleeping quarters, any of which causes may and in all probability do weaken or destroy the pig's inherited urge to life, health and happiness. In other words, lack of sanitation in care and environment. Of the infectious - diseases, cholera and necro seemed the most dreaded. • The first could be insured against by serums, the second avoided by diligent care and watchfulness lest' infection be brought in yards. Warm, dry sleeping quarters, free from drafts are good "flu" preventatives and one should rid himself of tubercular cattle and fowls and keep pigs out of quarters inhabited by such. The parasites, both external and internal, were, I found, about as sure as death and taxes, but that the external ones such as lice and mange were of easy control. The internal ones, worms, I found just literally played such havoc with a little pig's thrift and his ultimate feeding-cut qualities that extreme precautions were warranted to pre - vent infestation. Now how was I to avoid in the simplest, cheapest and easiest way the dangerous environments which were quite sure to bring death or unthriftiness to my pigs? The answer is — SANITATION — but how? The solution of this question seemed not difficult at all, for of all sug - gestions offered by successful producers and experiment stations, the one most mentioned was that system developed in an Illinois county called the McLain County system of swine sanitation. This was the system I decided to adopt. Clean mothers, in clean individual farrow - ing quarters, then to clean pastures with clean water and clean food and feeders, surely MUST insure clean and thrifty pigs. What did sanitation do for my hogs? This being my first venture, I have no records of my own with which to compare my final results. </seg>

I did lose too many little pigs before weaning through injury, I had two deaths of adult pigs from cause undetermined, two with navel ruptures, and I feel a rather serious setback to the younger pigs because of the older ones robbing them of their mother's milk. (Remember, there was fifty days' difference in ages of the oldest and youngest litters.)

Filley of. the Agricultural College, whose address at Alliance preceded mine, showed charts which indicate that I am wrong when I say that the second highest period of market prices is in late June and early July. I am unable to locate the sources of my information, so cannot say whether my recollection or informa - tion was at fault. I think it proper to make some note in this connec - tion, as Mr. Filley is without doubt right, and shows August next highest The graph I saw showed a slump in August as I remember it. </seg>

M. In the absence of President Graff, Director Dan Hildebrand acted in his stead. Thirty men, including a number desiring membership, were present. The minutes of the 1928 annual meeting were read and approved, as were also the minutes of the 1928 meeting of the board of directors. The financial report showed the treasury to contain $715.00. It was accepted as read. Under the order of old business, the chairman requested the secre - tary to discuss the activities of the past season. The discussion which followed brought out the fact that the association had sponsored the following: . It had purchased sufficient equipment to permit the secretary to hold forty-six farm demonstrations in all parts of the state, at which better hitching methods for larger teams were shown to 3,462 farmers. It had sponsored a state pig crop contest which was entered by seventy-two hog men. Two sheep feeders' meetings, two cattle feeders' meetings and one hog feeders' meeting held in cooperation with other agencies were attended by 2,140 farmers. A thirty-six-foot educational exhibit featuring the value of good feeder cattle as compared to scrubs was placed at the State Fair and two county fairs. Two hundred and forty-three dollars in prizes were awarded to boys' and girls' club members who were conducting live stock activities. One hundred and fifty dollars were awarded to the College Judging Team to help pay their expenses to the Chicago International Live Stock Exhibition. A three-day annual convention with seven out-state speakers on important topics, a judging contest and an annual banquet was partici - pated in by 1,125 farmers. Numerous other worthy activities such as prizes for high school judging contests, exhibits and literature encouraging the use of meat, and so forth, were forwarded under the auspices of the association. </seg>
            <seg id="p634">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE At this time it was suggested by Mr. Gramlich that the annual banquet seemed to be suffering in popularity. He questioned the ad - visability of its continuance. After some discussion pro and con, it was moved,' seconded and carried that a committee of three be appointed by the chair to determine the advisability of continuing. the banquet as a part of the winter meetings. Messrs. K. C. Fouts, W. O. Buel and W. J. Loeffel were appointed. After some discussion of dissatisfaction over the shortness of the various programs, Mr. Buel moved and Mr. Sweet seconded that here - after if it seemed advisable the annual convention meetings should begin on the first Tuesday morning in January instead of in the after - noon as had been the custom in the past. Motion carried. A discussion as to the advisability of assisting in the preparation of a special educational hog train during the coming year was referred by the chair with unanimous consent to the Board of Directors at their April meeting. At the suggestion of Mr. Gramlich, Mr. Graff was appointed to act as a legislative committee of one to look after the association's welfare with the legislature. At the regular election the following officers were named: President — Charles Graff, Bancroft Secretary — O. O. Waggener, Lincoln. Treasurer — H. J. Gramlich, Lincoln.

            <seg id="p641">THE FEDERAL POTATO INSPECTION SERVICE E. F. McKUNE, Denver, Colo., Senior Marketing; Specialist, U. S. Department of Agriculture Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: It is a pleasure to be called upon to discuss some of the work of my division, and I take this opportunity to thank those in charge who have made my appearance possible. The subject of my talk today pertains to federal-state inspection, how the work is conducted and some of the benefits that result. A few years ago, as has already been mentioned here this morning, Nebraska had a compulsory inspection law which was later changed to an optional law, and, I believe that this law is in force at the present time. Since you have had an inspection service in this state within the past few years, perhaps some of the things I have to say are not entirely new to you. However, for those who are not acquainted with our work I would like briefly to touch upon the history of the inspection service and some of the ways that we can be of benefit to the growers and shippers. The inspection service was first started on a nation-wide basis in 1922. The work the first year was comparatively small. However, since that time we have shown a decided increase in the number of cars inspected. Last year we inspected more than 211,000 cars. In order to do this amount of work it was necessary for us to cooperate with forty different states. Every state that produces any volume of fruits and vegetables with one exception — that exception being Ne - braska. It is interesting to note that in the inspection of the 211,000 cars we inspected more than fifty different commodities. The majority of the cars, of course, were composed of apples, potatoes, onions and melons, but we do find in the list such products as endive, chickory, horseradish and garlic. These last named products comprise only a few cars in comparison with the whole, but are given to illustrate some of the prob - lems we are expected to solve. You may wonder why growers and shippers of fruits and vegetables are willing to support the inspection service to the extent that they do. This can best be answered by discussing the situation in Colorado. My reason for selecting Colorado is that I have been connected with the work in that state for the past eight years and am well acquainted with the work there and results obtained. </seg>
            <seg id="p642">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE In 1921 and 1922 Colorado had a compulsory inspection law very similar to the Nebraska law. This was later changed to an optional law, and since that time have been working: on that basis. The first year, under the optional service, we inspected only a few more than 10,000 cars. However, the work has grown consistently until last year we inspected more than 22,000 cars, or approximately 70 per cent of the total shipments from the state and about 10 per cent of the total inspec - tions made in the United States. Fruits and vegetables are grown in many different parts of Colorado. Some of the districts are large and some comparatively small, but it makes it necessary that we maintain an inspection force in practically all parts of the state, and by means of this force and the certificates that they write we are able to make some comparisons that will be of interest to you. These will be brought out later. We have found that inspection at shipping point and the issuing of a certificate materially assists in the settlement between- the grower and shipper. Take the San Luis valley, for instance, where we inspect a very large percentage of the total shipments, we find the buyers probably see less than 10 per cent of the cars they purchase. Very often they do not see the grower or loader, all business being transacted over the telephone on the basis of the federal-state certificate. After the car has been purchased it has been found that the inspection certificate will go a long way toward making sales stick at receiving point. It is true that a receiver can reject a car if inspected at shipping point, but he will not reject as quickly as he would if the car were not inspected, and neither will he ask for the amount of allowance on the car before he will make settlement. Usually his request is for an amount small enough so that the shipper cannot afford to bring suit. We do, however, have a number of cases where the shipper has brought suit against the receiver on the basis of an inspection certificate and has been able to collect the amount of the sale price. The next place where we find that a certificate is of value is in the collection of railroad claims, and I wish at this time to make it clear that any remarks I may make are not to be interpreted as meaning that railroad claim departments are not willing to pay justified claims, but sometimes it is necessary that we furnish considerable evidence to prove that a claim is justified, and to date the inspection certificate has been found to be of most value. ■ ' Recently one of our shippers in Colorado called our attention to the fact that he was able to collect a claim for more than $1,000 on a car load of onions. This car, it seems, was shipped under heater service, but some time during the period of transit the heaters went out and the car froze so badly that when it reached destination it was practically without value. The shipper by means of a certificate was able to con- </seg>
            <seg id="p643">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION vince the railroad claim department that the car graded U. S. No. 1 at shipping point. We have a. railroad operating in Colorado and to the east whose claim department will not settle a claim on products originating in Colo - rado until they have fully determined whether or not the car was covered by an inspection certificate, and if so, a certificate is secured and settle - ment made on that basis. Another claim department of a railroad operating in Colorado ad - vises that unless a claim is supported by an inspection certificate they immediately discount the claim 25 per cent. My remarks so far have shown how inspection and certification are of benefit to the railroad and shipper, and some of you may wonder how the grower is benefited. We feel that the greatest benefit that inspec - tion can be to the grower is through the assistance that he receives in grading and packing his products so that they will meet competition of like products on the distant markets. For example, if you were to visit the. Chicago market today you would find potatoes on that market being offered for sale from Idaho, Colorado, Nebraska, Minnesota, Michigan and Wisconsin, each of these states striving to secure a market for their products, and a market that will recompense them for their efforts. In order that potatoes bring a satisfactory price on markets such as named, it is necessary, that they have a quality as good or better than a majority of the competing cars. A carload of inferior potatoes on the market not only brings a price that it does not warrant, but at the same time will materially reduce the price on the better graded cars. Another thing that inspection does to assist the grower can best be -shown by making comparison between an inspected district and one that lias only a few cars inspected annually. In the inspected district we find the growers alert, willing and anxious to do anything to build up a reputation for quality. We find them using more certified seed potatoes each year, and this should be of interest to you who are growing certified seed potatoes on a commercial basis. We find many of them growing their own seed products and we hear them making such remarks as "hill selection," "tuber unit," etc. . A check of the inspection certificates from that district shows that the percentage of number of cars shipped is now on the incline rather than the decline, and we can expect the quality to be a little better each year. On the other hand, take a non-inspected district or a district where only a few cars are inspected annually, we find the growers indifferent as to quality. They plant seed that has been selected from the bin or sometimes from the small and inferior potatoes produced by themselves, and in place of the quality of the commodity growing better, we find it </seg>
            <seg id="p644">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE growing poorer each year. And at the same time we find that the pota - toes from this district will not demand the price potatoes do from in - spected districts. This price ranges anywhere from 15 to 60 cents, de - pending on the price. In making these comparisons I feel that I have shown that inspection at shipping point materially assists the grower by helping him to market his commodity to a better advantage in competi - tion with other states or districts, and it assists a state or district in building up and maintaining a quality reputation. I have been asked to say something about receiving point inspec - tions. Along with the shipping point inspection service we maintain a receiving point inspection service. These inspectors are located in forty of the larger receiving markets. The chief duties of a receiving point inspector is to settle difficulties between shippers and receivers, to inspect cars in transit in order that a distant .shipper may know whether or not he should sell or divert his car, and to inspect commodities in storage. Many of our shippers, especially western shippers, find it to their advantage to place their shipments in storage in the larger markets in order that they may be able to take advantage of any sudden raise in prices. These shippers often wish to know the condition of their products from time to time and are willing that the receiving point in - spector make the inspections for them. The question will probably arise as to whether a certificate made at shipping point can be reversed at receiving point. My answer to that is yes. If an inspection is improperly made at shipping point it can be reversed at receiving point, but this necessitates two inspectors, and the contents of the car must be made accessible. However, the reversals are not now as frequent as we are oftentimes led to believe. For in - stance, last year we had ten cars reversed out of 22,000 cars, or about one car out of every 2200. Considering the fact that these inspections were made by human beings, we think that this record is not bad at all, and Colorado's records for last year compares very favorably with the record of other states. I have been asked to show how Nebraska can be benefited by federal - state inspection. After the remarks I have just made, I will not go into this in detail, but I do wish to give you the. results of some of my findings. I have recently taken the opportunity to examine market re - ports covering Nebraska potatoes during the period that Nebraska used inspection and since. I found that during the period Nebraska used inspection the prices you received on your potatoes were just as high, and in many cases higher than the prices received in other states on like or similar varieties, using U. S. No. 1 grade as a basis. Since that time the report shows that you have received anywhere from 15 to 30 </seg>
            <seg id="p645">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION cents a hundred less for your potatoes than they have in inspected dis - tricts for like varieties. Mr. Chairman, this concludes my remarks. If anyone has any ques - tions to ask, I will be more than pleased to try to answer them. FACTORS AFFECTING THE PRICE OF FARM PRODUCTS H. C. FILLEY, Professor of Rural Economics, University of Nebraska Nearly everyone who lives in Nebraska is interested either directly or indirectly in the price which the farmer receives for his products. The farmer and his family are interested because their purchases are necessarily limited by their income. As a matter of course the farmer is also interested in the price of the goods that he buys, because the amount of his purchases necessarily, depends upon the relationship ex - isting between the price of what he sells and the price of what he buys. If this relationship is satisfactory, that is, if the price of what he sells is relatively high compared with the price of what he buys, we say that the farmer is prosperous. , Under such conditions he is able to purchase not only the necessities of life, but many comforts and possibly some luxuries. Various explanations have been offered as to why the prices of farm products go up and down, and the power to determine prices has been ascribed to various forces. Very often price changes are attributed to a single force, but accumulated evidence seems to indicate that they are usually the result of a combination of forces. The more important of these forces are supply and demand, cost of production, market strategy, monopoly, the quantity of money in circulation and the rapidity with which it circulates, credit, transportation costs, commercial costs, and import duties. Supply and Demand '• Under competitive conditions, the forces which have the greatest influence .in determining the price of any product at any given time and place are supply and demand. The supply of a thing as used in the phrase "supply and demand" is the quantity that will be offered for sale at a given price; the demand is the quantity that will be bought at a given price. If the price of a commodity is lowered, more is pur - chased; if the price is raised, less will be purchased. Sellers, if they wish buyers to take more of a commodity, must reduce the price; if they raise the price, they will sell less. Let us suppose, for example, that in </seg>
            <seg id="p646">REPORT OK NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE some locality strawberries are produced in unusual abundance. At the ordinary price not all the crop can be sold, for strawberries are very perishable and cannot be held for a higher market. The producers will, therefore, lower the price, which will increase the quantity taken, because when strawberries are cheap nearly everyone will buy them in abundance, not only for immediate use, but for canning or preserving. On the other hand, if strawberries are a short crop, the sellers will raise the price to a point where the demand is just sufficient to move them. If the demand for a product at a given price is .increased, as, for example, the demand for pork was increased during the war, the. price rises, until some persons necessarily decrease their consumption, and demand and supply meet at a new and higher level; on the other hand, if there is a falling off in demand, as always happens during a period cf business depression, sellers must either lower prices or put less on the market. Not only do the quantity supplied and the quantity demanded in - fluence price, but price influences the quantity supplied and demanded. When the price of a product is relatively high, producers increase the supply until, because of this increase, the price necessarily drops. For example, hogs were relatively high in 1921 compared with other farm products, and nearly all Corn Belt farmers were anxious to produce more hogs. The increased number of hogs caused prices to drop so that in 1923 they were relatively low. This low price caused many farmers to decrease hog production.. A decrease in the number of hogs was logically followed by an increase in price. As a matter of course, demand is influenced by various factors. In Nebraska, the demand for lemons is greater in July than in January and the demand for heavy clothing is greater in December than in June. A rain storm increases the demand for rain coats and rubbers. An in - crease in general prosperity is always accompanied by a demand for more and better goods, but demand decreases during a period of de - pression. Advertising is one of the most common means employed for increasing the demand for some particular commodity. The California citrus growers, for example, have increased the demand for oranges by well planned and well executed advertising campaigns. Advertising such staple products as wheat and corn would, however, have little effect upon the total consumption of wheat or potatoes. The manufac - turer of a given brand of flour may increase the demand for his flour by advertising, but the demand for some other brand or brands of flour is decreased by a like amount. The producers of such staples as corn, wheat, and oats are therefore much less interested in advertising their products than are the producers of such agricultural specialties as oranges, soft shelled walnuts, prunes and raisins. </seg>
            <seg id="p647">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION Cost of Production The cost of producing any commodity influences price in the long run because no one will continue to produce goods to be sold for less than it eosts to produce them, while if the price is well above produc - tion costs, other men will be induced to enter that particular field, and production will increase until the goods must be sold for lower prices if all are to be consumed. Cost of production has little if any effect on the price which may be obtained for perishable farm products at any particular time. For example, the 1928 potato crop was so large that few Nebraska growers expect to secure- cost of production. If they sell, it has to be at the price set by supply and demand. One effect of this low price will be a reduction in the 1929 potato acreage, so that unless the yield per acre is exceptionally high next year the producers may expect to secure at least their cost of production. If the potato yield in certain sections of the country should be very poor, due to drought, or floods, or other causes,' the growers in more favored localities will doubtless secure much more than production costs, because of the decreased supply. Any great improvement in methods of production naturally results in lower prices just as soon as it is generally adopted. The men who adopt such methods first are the ones who profit most. Production is increased under the new methods and the price falls until, generally speaking, over a period of years it is just about equal to cost of pro - duction. Improved farm machinery, for example, has greatly increased the amount of grain which one man can produce, and prices are there - fore lower than would be possible under the old wearisome hand methods. Market Strategy There are almost always forces at work which seek to fix a some - what different price than would be established by supply and demand under conditions of absolutely free competition. For example, Chicago market reports for March 27, 1922, said that the wheat market had advanced from 1% to 2% cents because of reports stating that "the wheat in several Kansas counties is damaged and not coming up well. Reports of damage by green bugs in Oklahoma and elsewhere were also of considerable effect in turning wheat traders on the bull side of the market during the last part of the day." Two days later wheat prices closed % to 1% cents lower and a market report stated: "Down turns in the price of wheat came chiefly near the end of the day and after a former president of the Kansas State Board of Agriculture was quoted as saying the Kansas wheat crop was entering the growing season with a prospect of a greater production </seg>

Doubtless someone profited because of these price changes, and as a matter of course some - one else lost. The green bug did little damage that season. ■ ■ ■ " ' . ' ■■..■.. i Monopoly Monopoly has been defined as "that substantial unity of action on the part of one or more persons engaged in some kind of business which gives exclusive control, more particularly although not solely, with re - spect to price." . The owner of a copyright has a complete monopoly, since he has control of the price at which the material copyrighted is sold. He can fix this price because he controls the supply. As a matter of course if he sets the price too high the sales will be so few that his total profits vill be small. On the other hand, he might set the price so low that although the sales were large the total net profit would be small. He would, therefore, probably set the price at the point some - where between these two that he believed would give him the greatest net profit. The effect of monopoly upon the price is really a supply and demand effect, since the monopolist can fix the price because he controls the supply. Money An increase in the amount of money in circulation causes the gen - eral price level to rise, while a. decrease causes it to fall. In other words, as the supply of money increases the demand for it decreases, and a greater amount of it is required in exchange for other commodities. Without making an exhaustive explanation it may be stated that "the value of money, under the simplest conditions, is exactly inverse to its quantity." If the quantity of money in circulation is doubled, other conditions remaining the same, prices will be twice as high as before and the value of money will be one-half. It should be remembered that conditions are far from simple and are constantly changing. Changes in the amount of money in circulation have so far been accompanied more or less closely by changes in other forces affecting prices. At the outbreak of the World War in 1914, the per capita' circulation of money in the United States was $34.92 and upon the 31st of October, 1920, it was $63.60. Today it is about $40.00 per capita. The inflation of the currency was responsible in part for the high prices of the war and post-war boom period, and responsible to a greater degree than any other single factor for the general price level being higher today than in the years immediately preceding the war. The rapidity with which money circulates is also a factor affecting prices. This is because it is the money which is expended that creates the demand for goods. If everyone spends money as quickly as possible </seg>
            <seg id="p649">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION after it conies into his possession, as there was a tendency to do in the inflation period following the war, the price of commodities will in - evitably rise. Doubling the work that a dollar does is just as effective as doubling the number of dollars. Decreasing the work done by dollars, that is, keeping them out of circulation by being slow to make purchases, lowers prices as does a decrease in the actual number of dollars. Credit The immediate effect of credit sales on prices is the same as cash sales, because credit sales constitute a demand for goods. This effect is counterbalanced when the debts incurred by the purchase of goods are paid, because the money is then used in payment of a past demand instead of being used to satisfy a present demand. It will thus be seen that a very general granting of credit, such as we find in a period of business expansion, tends to raise prices. In 1919 not only could almost anyone get credit, but apparently almost everyone did get credit. Business boomed and prices rose. We were spending the earnings of the future. When creditors began demanding payment there was a sharp decrease in the demand for goods. The money which was being used in payment for debts contracted months before could not be used for new purchases, necessity for can - celling credit obligations was therefore one of the causes contributing to the price decline which began in the summer of 1920. When credit instruments are used in place of money, as when we make payment by check, the effect is the same as increasing the volume of money. Unquestionably the increase of deposit banking and the extensive use of the bank check, which decreases the amount of money which most people carry, has had an effect on prices. The use of Liberty Bonds in payment for land and other purchases contributed to the post-war boom. We used them as money and therefore the effect was the same as if the volume of money had been increased. Transportation Transportation charges ordinarily increase the margin between the price received by the producer and that paid by the consumer by the amount of the charge. It is, therefore, obvious that an increase in transportation costs either decreases the price paid to the producer or increases the price paid by the consumer, or possibly the increased cost is divided between producer and consumer. The increase in freight rates is one reason why farm machinery is so much higher today than in pre-war years. Freight adds very ma - terially to the cost of such raw material as iron, coal, and wood and thus increases the cost of the manufactured product. Whether farm (20) </seg>
            <seg id="p650">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE machinery is sold f. o. b. factory, as is the prevailing: custom, or f. o. b. destination, the freight charge is really paid by the retailer and becomes part of his cost and therefore increases his selling price. Freight is an important item not only in the price of farm machinery, but in the price we pay for many other important articles. Transportation costs have an evert greater effect upon the price of most agricultural products than upon the price of manufactured goods, uecause of their greater bulk in proportion to their value. An increase of 5 cents a pound in transporting a suit of clothes would increase the cost very little, but an increase of one-half cent a pound in transporting hay to market would add $10 per ton to the difference between the price received by the producer for his hay and that paid by the consumer. In many instances this would prove prohibitive. The price paid for wheat at a country elevator is ordinarily the terminal market price less freight and other handling charges. As we go westward across Nebraska a decrease in the wheat price may be noted which corresponds quite closely to the increase in freight charges to Omaha and Kansas City. The price in Omaha' is usually lower than the price in Chicago by the cost of freight and handling between these cities, and the Chicago price is in turn lower than the Liverpool price, where our wheat sells in competition with wheat from Canada, Argen - tina, and Australia. The price of surplus farm products decreases as the distance from market increases. This price variation corresponds to the cost of freight and handling charges. Local demand for wheat for milling or for seed may raise the price above the terminal market price. This is because freight and handling charges must be added to the price of wheat brought in from outside to sell in a wheat deficient area. The price of the home grown product naturally rises to the same level. The increase in freight rates has increased the spread between the price paid locally for many products in Nebraska and the price at the terminal markets. This brings to us the question of modifying our agriculture so that we may either reach markets closer home or ship to the more distant markets those products, such as butter and eggs, which have a relatively high value per pound. Commercial Costs Trade costs, such as commission or brokerage, inspection, weighing, insurance, yardage, and feeding costs, affect the price of farm products much as do transportation charges. They increase the spread between the price received by the producer and that paid, by the consumer. In all organized markets such charges are uniform and regulated by rule. </seg>
            <seg id="p651">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION The elevator which ships 200 carloads of wheat to a commission firm in Omaha (or any other large market) pays the same selling costs per bushel as the man who ships but a single carload. Although such charges are a relatively small percentage of the selling price they do constitute. a very definite charge which must be paid. The general public is interested not only in the service being performed for the shipper more economically than he could perform it for himself, but in its being performed with the utmost efficiency. A grain exchange which handles no small part of the grain produced in Nebraska has a rule requiring that all grain sold on the exchange must be weighed in elevators at that terminal market A "shipper's weight" rule was formerly in force. As a result of this rule every bushel of grain -which passes through this market pays an additional charge of one-half cent Perhaps the service is worth the cost; if not it unnecessarily reduces the net price received by the producer for his' grain. • . ■ . ■ Farmers' cooperative commission companies are already operating in several of the more important livestock markets. The Capper- Tincher law provides that the representatives of cooperative companies shall be admitted to grain exchanges on the same basis as other ap - plicants, except that as members they may distribute their earnings to their patrons. Since these cooperative firms are owned by the producers themselves, they should furnish a very satisfactory index as to the efficiency of the service now being rendered. Import Duties Import duties do not affect the price of those products of which we have an exportable surplus. A tariff on wheat for example, cannot increase the price of wheat which we export and sell in the world market m competition with the wheat grown in Canada, Argentina, and other countries. A general tariff on wheat probably increases the price paid for certain grades of wheat which are particularly desirable for milling and which we do not produce in quantity sufficient for our own needs. No. 1 Northern spring wheat when scarce commands a premium over other wheats because millers wish it to mix with the softer wheats in making a very high grade flour. The tariff on wheat is therefore of benefit to certain growers, but not to all. Corn hogs and cotton are other crops little affected by a tariff because we ordinarily produce an ample supply for our own needs. A tariff on those agricultural products of which we do not have an exportable surplus tends to increase the price paid to the producers Other conditions remaining the same, wool is undoubtedly higher in price and wool producers more prosperous when there is a tariff on </seg>
            <seg id="p652">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE wool than when it is admitted free. Among other farm products the price of which has been influenced by an import duty may be mentioned lemons, raisins, olives, soft-shelled walnuts. With the exception of sugar beets, and wool and butter, the price of the most important farm products of Nebraska', including corn, wheat, oats, cattle, hogs, poultry, and eggs, is ordinarily influenced but little if any by a tariff. It is true that each of these commodities is imported into the United States to some extent, but the total exports "ordinarily exceed the total imports. So far as Nebraska farmers are concerned, the direct effect of a tariff upon the major portion of their products is therefore almost negligible.

Zl « *5 2ft 25 je6 27 Zo FIG. 1 — Relation between the production and price of potatoes, 1880 to 1920. Potato Acreage Production and Price The annual production of potatoes and the December 1 farm price for the years 1866 to 1928, inclusive, make an interesting study when presented graphically. This chart (see Fig. 1) indicates very clearly the part played by supply and demand in setting the price upon potatoes. Whenever the production is large the price falls, and when the produc - tion is small the price rises. It is also noticeable that the acreage always tends to increase after a year or two of good prices. Doubtless </seg>
            <seg id="p653">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION the increase in acreage is actually greater than that given by the Year - book of the U. S. Department of Agriculture, because if potato prices are high many thousands of village and city gardens will contain a few rows of potatoes which do not enter into the department figures. The lowest price of course occurs in years when the acreage is large and the yield per acre high. The price of potatoes is depressed more by high yields than are the prices of other commodities. One reason is that they are perishable, and can be carried in storage for only a limited time. Old potatoes have little value after new potatoes at a reasonable price come on the market. Another reason is that the demand for potatoes is less elastic than the demand for most fruits and many vegetables that are of an even mere perishable nature. Most people will eat about the same . amount of potatoes whether they are 50 cents a bushel or three times that amount. Let strawberries, peaches or apples fall to one-half the regular price and the consumptian will probably be doubled. fcOOi ■ I . 187 VOICE — (T \\ «* -&gt;oo ; M I \ ■ ; ■t r - rt H — wo *so : : _J .''./.&gt; . » , *co \a I \ ,/M / 3 A M* \W /'* O350 . /\ / ' f \ / V i /' cfcyaEEsfc--^:: - I0O j? i '__ ■ so&lt; 1 ' II I % so P o g p ° p o ,o g FIG. 2— Effect of the World War upon the price of potatoes. This next chart (see Fig. 2) shows the effect of the war upon potato prices. The short crop of 1916 caused prices to rise very high in the spring and early summer of 1917. In 1917 acreage and production were the largest on record up to that time, but the price remained well above the pre-war level. A decrease in production in 1918-1919 was naturally followed by very high prices in the early part of 1920, and a </seg>
            <seg id="p654">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE slight increase in the acreage planted. In 1921 there -was another in - crease in acreage but a reduction in yield per acre so that the producer received very satisfactory prices. This stimulated the planting of pota - toes in 1922, which happened to be a very favorable season for potatoes. The result was a production which exceeded even the crop of 1917 and a price so low that thousands of acres of. potatoes were not dug. You will note also the large potato production in 1927 and as a result a relatively low price. This price did not, however, deter pro - ducers from planting an unusually large acreage in 1928. Old potatoes of excellent quality were on the market in all the northern states last May and June and reduced the demand for new potatoes from the southern states. The production of the new crop was therefore always well ahead of the demand. The potato producers of western Nebraska know only too well the effect of the large 1928 crop upon potato prices. Wheat Production and Price Probably more interest has centered around the marketing of wheat than of any other product. It is not only one of the most widely grown cereals, but is used more extensively for bread making than any other product. Unlike corn, oats, and barley, it is used but little for feeding livestock, so that almost the entire crop except that used for seed finds its way to market. "•• ' " ' ■ ' . ■'■'■■' Our Wheat Production and Exports The United States is one of the great wheat-export nations. For the fourteen-year period, 1913-26, we exported an annual average of approximately 230 million bushels, which was nearly 28 per cent of our total wheat production. These exports were abnormally large because of the war, but of the sixty crops grown from 1867 to 1926, inclusive, there were only two of which we exported less than 10 per cent. In the half century preceding 1928 there were but ten years when less than 19 per cent of our crop was exported. The wheat which we export is sold, in the markets of the world in competition with wheat grown in Canada, Argentina, Australia, and other wheat-surplus countries. ■ Generally speaking, the price paid for cash wheat at Chicago is the Liverpool price less cost of transportation and handling charges. World supply and world demand cannot be ignored in any discussion of wheat marketing. </seg>

The price of wheat declined follow - ing the Civil War, the low point being reached in the period of financial depression in the middle nineties. Increased efficiency of production has aided in keeping wheat prices low during the years when the gen - eral price level was rising because of the increase in our circulating media and other factors.

Without exception, a decreased pro - duction is accompanied by a price rise, the most marked example being the years 1916-20. Whenever Russian production reaches a pre-war level we may expect even lower prices for wheat until the acreage of wheat in the United States and other countries now shipping wheat to Europe is reduced because of the crop's failing to pay cost of production. It is generally admitted that the Liverpool price of wheat is largely, if not entirely, a supply and demand price. This must be conceded even by those who believe that the price is influenced by speculation. If this is true, how is it possible for American growers to set a monopoly price, even though every bushel that we grow should be placed in a national pool? We cannot dominate the world market. The culture of wheat is too widely distributed.

Marketings and Prices of Wheat. The heavy line represents the monthly marketings* of wheat by the farmers. The dotted line represents the- weighted average price per bushel of all classes and grades at Chicago. Data from Yearbook, U. S. D. A., 1927. The monthly marketing of wheat in the -United States and the Chicago price per bushel for the years 1918 to 1927, inclusive, are shown on the next chart (see Fig. 5). The amount of wheat marketed during the different months of the years varies widely, ordinarily being largest ■ in July, August, September, and October, and smallest in April, May, and June. In the five-year period, July, 1922, June, 1926, 62% per cent of the wheat was marketed in the four months following harvest. The price of wheat at a terminal market varies from day to day and from month to month. It is based primarily upon world supply and world demand, but is influenced by many other factors. With but few exceptions, during the years studied the price was lowest during the late summer and autumn when the new crop was coming to market, and highest in late spring and early summer when the available supply of American wheat had been held in storage for nearly a' year. The records of the Chicago Board of Trade do not indicate that the volume of wheat coming to market upon any one day or during any one week has any very direct connection with price. Buyers are more interested in the total amount of wheat produced in the United States and the 'Percentage of year's total. (20a) </seg>
            <seg id="p658">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE remainder of the world than in the number of cars of wheat that happen to reach the terminal markets upon any one day. The seasonal variation in the price of wheat is much smaller than the seasonal variation in the amount marketed. Evidently there must be some reason why so many producers will each year hurry their wheat to market immediately after threshing although the price at that time is almost invariably lower than it is later in the year. Is it because necessity compels them to dump their product, or may there possibly be some other reasons? There should also be some explanation of the fact that the wide variations in the amount of grain marketed do not cause a much greater variation in price. There are several advantages in hauling wheat or oats from the threshing machine directly to market. The cost of storage, insurance, and extra handling are saved, and loss from shrinkage is eliminated. Even when the farmer has a granary permitting home storage he must consider taxes, extra handling, and possible loss from the weevil and other causes. The sale of grain often permits the farmer to pay loans, thus saving the interest on borrowed capital, or permits him to invest in time deposits or other interest-bearing securities. If the net v^lue accruing from these advantages of early marketing equal or approxi - mately equal the value added to the grain by holding we may expect farmers who live near a market to continue to sell their surplus wheat at the earliest opportunity.

This is less than the cost of holding wheat for ten months in a public warehouse. It is interesting to study not only the average monthly price of wheat, but also the price changes from month to month in recent years. Orderly Marketing of Wheat . There has probably been more discussion in the Grain Belt of the orderly marketing of wheat than of any other one product. Because wheat sales and shipments are heavy from the middle of July until late autumn, many persons think that the wheat is being dumped and the market glutted. The charts that we Have discussed show that world production has. a much greater influence upon price than has the rate of marketing. The market price of wheat depends primarily upon the amount of wheat that has been produced which will be marketed during the year. As long as the supply marketed is equal to current milling and export needs it makes little difference whether the surplus is stored in an elevator at the terminal market, in a country elevator, or in a bin on the farm where it was produced. Wheat is a world crop. It is easily stored. It is bought and sold on grain exchanges on every business day of every year. Terminal market prices are a matter of record and are widely published. Wheat is a staple food for approximately one billion persons, and the majority of them consume it in some form three times each day. Because of almost world-wide demand for wheat its production and price are closely studied by many persons. Buyers are constantly watch - ing the market for the opportunity of buying during any price decline. From the standpoint of orderly marketing the logical time for the United States to sell the major part of its surplus is during the months when other exporting nations are placing little wheat on the world mar - ket. These months are the months immediately following our harvest. They are the months when farmers actually do sell the most wheat and when our exports are heaviest. Perhaps no other crop is marketed in as orderly a manner from the standpoint of the. right quantity at the right time and place as is wheat. Most farmers produce as high a quality of wheat as is possible. They necessarily market the quality that they produce. When more is known of protein content and the estimated quantity of high-protein wheat produced in any one year, it may be possible for producers of such wheat to watch for high-protein premiums and thus secure a higher average price. The increasing use of the combine in the Great Plains may make a material change in wheat marketing. It is certainly increasing the </seg>
            <seg id="p660">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE . rate at which wheat is sent to market in July, and unfortunately a part of this wheat is high in moisture content. A possible result is that there will be an increase in wheat storage by farmers who do not use the combine. Some groups of producers or buyers will certainly be on the lookout to profit from any departure from the normal price. Since wheat is already marketed in an orderly manner in the United States, compared with the marketing of most other farm products, the organizations that promise improvements in this particular respect apparently face a somewhat difficult task. Their energies could doubt - less be expended in some way that would be of greater benefit to the wheat producers. One other factor which affects price and which we should discuss is quality. We all realize that quality does affect potato prices. It also has a more potent effect than we sometimes realize upon the price of wheat. For example, it is difficult to compare the prices paid for wheat in Canada with those paid in the United States because the Canadian grades are not the same as the Federal wheat grades used in the United States; the varieties of wheat grown are not identical, and the effect of seasonal differences upon the protein content of American wheat causes a variation in the premium paid here for wheat containing a high percentage of protein. If high-protein wheat is scarce, then wheat containing a high percentage of protein commands a high premium. If high-protein wheat is plentiful, then the premium for protein is small. ' We grow five different types of wheat in the United States: Hard Red Spring Wheat » Durum Wheat Hard Red Winter Wheat u Soft Red Winter Wheat White Wheat The wheat commonly grown in the prairie provinces of Canada is Hard Red Spring wheat. It is similar to the Hard Red Spring wheat grown in Minnesota, the Dakotas, and Montana, but there are variations from year to year in protein content and in other qualities. A com - parison of American and Canadian spring wheat made by the Food Research Institute of Stanford University made (in part) as follows: "As a rule, higher grades make up a larger proportion of the crop of Canadian hard spring wheat than of American hard spring wheat. Elevator-run Canadian spring wheat usually meets the prade specifica - tions easily, whereas in the case of American hard spring wheat elevator - run grain is commonly mixed so as just to make the grade. . </seg>
            <seg id="p661">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION "Apart from cleanness, high percentage of vitreous kernels, and low count of deteriorated kernels, the chief superiorities of Canadian wheat for millers lie in the heavy weight and the high protein content. On the average, Canadian hard spring wheat is. several pounds heavier per volume bushel than American hard spring wheat. Hard spring wheats sold on the sample market in Minneapolis are in ordinary years rarely overweight; at Winnipeg elevator-run wheats are often, indeed in good years usually, overweight, the exact weight, however, being known. This high weight finds direct expression in a heavier yield of flour, which has the effect of making, the heavier wheat cheaper for the miller. Average No. 1 Manitoba Northern will yield per 5 bushels in different years from 11 to 15 pounds more straight flour than may be secured from average No. 1 Dark Northern Spring; average No. 3 Manitoba Northern will yield about 4 to 6 pounds more straight flour per 5 bushels than average No. 1 Dark Northern. Not only are the specifications for weight consistently higher in the case of Canadian wheat, but overweight is common in Canadian wheat and uncommon in American wheat. The high-protein wheat gives stronger flour so that the net result is a larger yield of a stronger flour to the unit of wheat. For practical purposes, we may say that Manitoba Northern wheats are purchased and milled on the basis of official grades, whereas most Dark Northern wheats are purchased and milled on the basis of premiums for qualities lying outside of the grades. "Within the official grades; year in and year out, No. 3 Manitoba Northern is comparable with average No. 1 Dark Northern, usually with a slight superiority on the side of the Canadian wheat. It is commonly heavier, has a higher percentage of vitreous kernels, is cleaner, and gives a somewhat larger outturn of comparable flour. When the American miller contemplates an importation, he first con - siders No. 3 Manitoba Northern as alternative to average No. 1 Dark Northern Spring. "Roughly speaking, Canadian spring wheat runs 2 per cent higher in protein( say 14 instead of 12) than the American spring wheat, with variations from season to season. To put the matter another way, the protein content of No. 3 Manitoba Northern ordinarily runs as high as the average protein content of No. 1 Dark Northern Spring, with less variation in different samples within the grade." In recent years the closing price of No. 3 Manitoba at Winnipeg has ordinarily been from as little as 6 cents to as much as 10 cents below the closing price of No. 1 Manitoba. The most common variation in closing price has been about 7 or 8 cents. </seg>
            <seg id="p662">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Minneapolis cash prices are for wheat at Minneapolis; Winnipeg cash prices are for wheat at Fort William or Port Arthur on Lake Superior. A comparison of the price of • wheat at Minneapolis for a long period of years with the price of wheat at Winnipeg for the same period of years, for the purpose of determining the possible influence of the pool, is complicated by the fact that protein content was not an im - portant price-determining factor until the past few years. Because of their high protein content, Canadian wheats have therefore increased in price as compared with American wheats during the years that the pool has been active. As has been previously stated, the premium paid in the United States for protein depends upon the abundance or scarcity of high - protein wheat. If high-protein wheat is scarce the premium for protein may become so great that it becomes profitable to import Canadian wheat in spite of the tariff of 42 cents per bushel. The 1924 wheat crop of the United States was large and the supply of protein ample for our home needs. The Canadian crop for that year was small and the European millers were willing to pay a premium for Canada's exportable surplus of high-protein wheat. According to statistics pub - lished by the United States Department of Agriculture, the Winnipeg price for No. 1 Manitoba for the crop years 1924-25 averaged 10 cents higher than the Minneapolis price for No. 1 Northern Spring. American advocates of a wheat pool were quick to cite' this price differential as conclusive proof of the effectiveness of the Canadian pool. The next year, 1925, the United States crop was the smallest since 1917 and high-protein wheat was scarce. The Canadian crop, on the other hand, was 57 per cent larger than in 1924, and the world supply of high-protein wheat was ample. As a result the Minneapolis price of No. 1 Northern Spring averaged 10 cents per bushel higher than the Winnipeg price of No. 1 Manitoba. No evidence is available to indicate that pool activities were responsible for the price differentials, of these two years. In the spring of 1928 high-protein wheat sold in the United States for about 30 cents per bushel higher than wheat sold in Canada. The price of low-protein wheat was about 20 cents below the Canadian wheat price. Whether Canadian farmers actually received more for their wheat than farmers in the United States depended, of course, on the proportion of high-protein and low-protein wheat sold here. A study of fifty-four farmers' elevators- in Minnesota, North Dakota, and Montana for the crop year 1925 showed that the farmer patrons received on the average $1.41 per bushel for their wheat. The basic </seg>
            <seg id="p663">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION price paid by the Canadian pool for 1926 wheat delivered at Fort William was $1.45. Since all cost of transportation and handling are deducted from the pool terminal price, it is easy to determine that American spring wheat growers received more than Canadian growers received for somewhat better wheat. Demand, supply, and other well - known economic factors were the important price-determining forces. A comparison of future prices is even less satisfactory than a com - parison of cash prices. No. 1 Manitoba wheat in storage at Fort William or Port Arthur on Lake Superior is the basis of Winnipeg future trad - ing. The Minneapolis basis is No. 1 Northern in storage at Minneapolis. The Canadian seller may deliver No. 2 Manitoba at a discount of 3 cents per bushel and No. 3 Manitoba at a discount of 8 cents per bushel. This 8 cents must necessarily be subtracted from the Winnipeg price in order to get the future price of the grade comparable with No. 1 Northern. The reshipment freight rate on wheat in carload lots from Minneapolis to Duluth is 6.5 cents per hundred pounds, and this must be considered in order to obtain an exact comparison. While No. 1 wheat may be delivered on contract at Chicago, the contract grade is understood to be No. 2 Hard Winter, No. 2 Yellow Hard Winter, and No. 2 Red Winter. At Kansas City, No. 2 Hard Winter wheat Is understood to be the contract grade, although other No. 1 and No. 2 winter wheats may be delivered at the contract price. The Canadian future contract means high-protein wheat, because Canada has so little low-protein wheat that ordinarily no protein tests are ' made. A differential m the price of wheat for future delivery favorable to Winnipeg as compared with American markets is there - fore merely a differential indicative of the difference in grade, protein content, and location of wheat of "contract" grade. Sales for future delivery are made upon the basis of grade. No consideration is given to protein content, although, as has been previ - ously stated, protein is a very important factor in determining price. For example, in the spring of 1928, No. 2 Hard Winter wheat containing 14 per cent of protein sold as high as $1.80 per bushel when wheat of the same grade containing 10 per cent of protein was worth only $1.30 per bushel on the same market. As a matter of course, when wheat is sold for furture delivery at any market in the United States, both buyer and seller expect that low-protein wheat will be delivered because the seller will naturally deliver the cheapest wheat that can be secured of the grade specified. Our future price is therefore the price of low - protein wheat. In general the same factors affect the price of corn, oats and other cereals that affect the price of wheat. It would be interesting to point </seg>
            <seg id="p664">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE out some of the specific changes that have taken place in price due to various causes, but time forbids. In closing 1 I wish to emphasize one additional point. It is im - possible for any group of producers, whether farmers or manufacturers, to control the price of any product unless they can control the quantity produced. The Stevensen plan of rubber control failed because the production of rubber increased. Brazil is encountering difficulties with her scheme of coffee valorization. The producers of raisins in California long ago gave up the idea of price control without production control. It would certainly be more difficult to control the price of either potatoes or wheat than to control the price of these other commodities that I have mentioned because potatoes and wheat are so widely grown. Farmers as individuals can influence their own profits by studying the reports put out by the Federal and state agencies relative to probable future production and regulating their own production accordingly. Organized farmers can influence price by establishing and maintaining quality standards and by reducing market costs. CROP ROTATIONS AND POTATO PROFITS JAMES A. HOLDEN, Superintendent Scottsbluff Experiment Farm, Mitchell, Nebraska When the total production of potatoes in the United States is more than four hundred million bushels the potato grower is on dangerous ground. And the further he goes over this four hundred million bushel dead line the more apt he is to get hit. This past season the potato growers we"nt so far over this dead line that they were all shot to pieces and those that were not able to get to shelter behind some other crop will have difficulty in recovering. It requires about four hundred million bushels of potatoes to supply the table use and furnish seed for the next year's crop.. The public is willing to pay a price high enough so that the grower will realize as much as $1.50 per hundred, and it might go as high as $2.00 per hundred before it would cut down any on consumption. Before the public would go without potatoes it would pay as much as seven or eight cents per pound, but it does not seem possible to increase consumption by lower - ing the price. That is, the public eat about the same amount of potatoes whether the price is $2.00 or 50 cents per hundred. If four hundred million bushels are enough to supply the demand and the grower produces four hundred fifty million bushels he is pro - ducing fifty million bushels more than is needed. Following the law </seg>
            <seg id="p665">' NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION of supply and demand, this fifty million bushel surplus is a handicap. It governs the price of the whole crop. It is a known fact that a three hundred fifty million bushel crop will bring the grower a great deal more money than will a four hundred fifty million bushel crop. The reason for this is that there is no way of using this surplus so that it will bring anywhere near as much money as the public is willing to pay for potatoes for human food. It is not the fault of the public that potatoes are so cheap at the present time, it is the growers' fault: a penalty for over production. If the growers would refuse to sell potatoes for less than $1.50 per hundred the public would pay it and would, perhaps, consume just as many potatoes as it will by paying 50 cents, but it will not pay S1.50 for more potatoes than it needs. So, if the growers should pursue such a course they would still have this fifty million bushel surplus to contend with. What is to be done with it? Most growers have learned from past experience that when there is a four hundred fifty million bushel crop of potatoes that unless he undersells his neighbor a little he will have to haul out rotten potatoes the next summer, and nobody likes to haul rotten potatoes. So when harvesting time comes and the Government reports a four hundred fifty million bushel crop the grower becomes anxious to sell and the higher the estimated yield and the lower the price the more anxious he is to sell. I will venture to say that potato buyers put forth less energy in buying potatoes this year than they did in 1925 and 1926 when they had to pay three or four times as much for potatoes. I am not criticising the farmer for doing this. If he has the pota - toes he has got to sell them before summer or let them rot and he can afford to sell them at 50 cents per hundred rather than do this. It is true he could feed them to live stock, but before he can afford to feed them to live stock they are so cheap that the profit from the crop is gone. He can make more perhaps by selling them at 50 cents than he can by feeding them. Before potatoes can be profitably fed to live stock they must be cheap enough so that one bushel of corn will exchange for at least four and one-half bushels of potatoes. . If the potato growers were so well organized that every grower would take his share of this surplus off the market and feed it to live stock, or even dump it in a lake, then this small surplus would not have a depressing effect, on the price of the main crop. This is only a suggestion as to how .a surplus could be handled to the advantage of every grower if everyone would do it, but that is the rub, maybe some would and others would not. </seg>
            <seg id="p666">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE- There is an old saying that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. If it is this surplus which is causing all the trouble, why have a surplus? What factors contribute to a surplus? It is true that climatic conditions are factors. The same acreage may produce a surplus one year and not a surplus another year. The greatest con - tributing factor to this surplus is the increasing of acreage. If you will look up statistics you will find that when there is an unusually large acreage potatoes are cheap and when there is a short acreage prices are high. If all the potatoes produced this past summer by farmers who did not grow any potatoes in 1926 were taken off the market there would not be a surplus. There are farmers in the North Platte Valley who didn't have any potatoes in 1925, who had a large part of their farms in potatoes this past year. The chances are, however, that they will not have so many potatoes this coming year. These in-and-outers are responsible for the low price in potatoes at the present time more than all other factors combined. Yet they are the ones who do the most yell - ing about low prices. It is very seldom that an in-and-outer makes money in growing potatoes, simply because he never grows potatoes except the year following the year when potatoes have been very profitable and then he puts most of his farm into potatoes and there are usually enough who follow this practice that there is an over production in the fall with low prices. Again he vows he will never grow another potato and he doesn't until along comes a very good potato year and the following year he is in just as strong as before. Potatoes are a good, profitable crop if a farmer will use a little judgment in growing them. The farmers who follow a cropping system in which they grow the same acreage each year on good productive land, use good seed and give their crop the proper care will make a profit from potatoes, not every year, but one year with another. On the other hand, I know of no crop on which an in-and-outer can lose more money than on pota - toes. The farmer who follows a somewhat definite crop rotation system avoids these mistakes. Where no definite rotation is followed there is a temptation to jump from one crop to another and usually the jump is made one year too late. Too many farmers are influenced by the prices which prevail at planting time as to what crops he will grow that particular year. If potatoes are high priced and corn is cheap he plants a large acreage of potatoes and a small acreage of corn and perhaps the prices are just the reverse the following spring and then he plants all of his land to corn and no potatoes. There are many advantages in following a definite cropping system. </seg>
            <seg id="p667">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION The cropping system that a farmer follows determines very largely his success or failure. If he follows a' well-planned crop rotation and gives his crops the proper care he should make a profit; on the other hand, if he follows a poor cropping system he usually loses money even though he gives his crops the proper care. This being true, the farmer can well afford to give considerable thought and study in plan - ning the crop rotation system which will best fit his conditions. In planning a crop rotation there are various things to consider. If it is an irrigated farm the cropping system should be one in which the irrigation water can be used to the best advantage, a better dis - tribution of labor, the elimination of risk from hail, diseases and the effect of low markets are other factors to be considered. Another and perhaps the most important factor of them all is the productiveness of the land. The cropping system should be. one in which the land be - comes more productive so that higher yields per acre may be obtained, not a higher total yield, for already we are producing a surplus, but a higher acre yield. It is possible to cut down the total production which will stimulate higher prices and at the same time by increasing the yield per acre produce as many profit bushels as from the higher quantity. Where it requires an acre yield of 125 bushels of potatoes to cover the acre cost of production, a yield of 150 bushels will return 25 bushels profit, while a 300-bushel yield will give a profit of 175 bushels. A 300-bushel yield, therefore, is seven times as profitable as a 150 - bushel yield. It will require 70 acres yielding 150 bushels per acre to give the same number of profit bushels as 10 acres yielding 300 bushels per acre. The 70 acres will produce a total of 10,500 bushels, while the 10 acres will produce 3000 bushels. Both fields produce the same num - ber of profit bushels, but in order to do so the 70 acres produce 250 per cent more potatoes than the 10 acres, or 7500 bushels more, and it is this 7500 bushels which yields no profit that helps to create an overproduction and low prices. Too many growers think in terms of total bushels instead of profit bushels. Low yields in most cases are due to poor, unproductive land; this is especially true on irrigated farms. It is not a difficult problem or an expensive operation to keep up the productiveness of an irrigated farm. This can be done by applying barnyard manure or by growing alfalfa or sweet clover on the land. This has been clearly demonstrated by the irrigated rotation experiments at the Scotts Bluff Experiment Farm. In these experiments there are 97 quarter-acre plats divided into 34 different cropping systems. In .15 of these different crop rotations potatoes are grown. Some of these potato rotations are manured at the rate of 12 tons per acre and other </seg>

            <seg id="p669">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION similar rotations do not receive any manure. Potatoes are also grown in rotations with alfalfa. In the manured rotations the potatoes follow the manure either the first or the second year, while in the alfalfa rotations the potatoes follow the alfalfa. The average acre yield of potatoes from these differently treated rotations during the past eight years is 144 bushels from the no manure rotations; 262 bushels from the rotations where manure was applied and 319 bushels from the rota - tions which had alfalfa. This is an increase of 118 bushels due to manure and 175 bushels due to the beneficial effect of alfalfa. The plat on which potatoes are grown each year has yielded on an average of 101 bushels per acre. There is also a marked difference in the quality of potatoes grown in these rotations. Those from the short rotations — 3 years or less — are very scabby, so scabby that they are usually unmarketable and are fed to live stock. When grown in 4-year rotations they are very much freer front scab and those from the 6 and 7-year rotations have still less. The effect of tlra. cropping system on the return from potatoes is still more apparent when expressed in dollars and cents. There is a marked difference in the profit and loss between high yields of good potatoes and low yields of poor potatoes. This can be better shown by the use of a chart. (A photograph of the chart is here given.) The prices used in making this chart are given on the chart. The chart shows graphically the profit or loss per acre of each crop grown in the rotation for 13 of 34 different cropping systems, 9 of which have potatoes. The profit or loss for the whole cropping system is also given when .figured to the bases of an 80-acre farm in which 77 acres are cropped. The rotation number is given and appears just above the column. Those with numbers less than 10 are continuously cropped plates; those in the 20's are 2-year rotations; in the 30's, 3-year rota - tions, and so on up to the 70's, which are 7-year rotations. The odd - numbered rotations receive manure periodically at the rate of 12 tons per acre, while the even-numbered rotations do not receive manure. Where the rotation is 4-years or longer alfalfa or sweet clover is used in the cropping system, but neither is used in the shorter rotations. The crops appearing below the base line on the chart show a financial loss, and those above the base line show a profit. The profit or loss from the different cropping systems', when figured on the basis of an 80-acre farm, range from a loss of $3250.00 in No. 4 system, which is continuous potatoes, to a net profit of $2140.00 in' rotation No. 71, in which there are 11 acres of oats seeded with alfalfa, 33 acres of alfalfa, 11 acres of potatoes and 22 acres of sugar beets. The profit or loss for each cropping system is given below the column. </seg>
            <seg id="p670">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE On an acre basis potatoes show both the greatest loss and the highest profit. Potatoes grown on the same land year after year show a loss of $42.00 per acre, whereas the potatoes grown on alfalfa land in the 6-and-7-year rotations show a net profit of $70.00. The average loss from all potatoes grown in short rotations amount to around $37.00 an acre, while those grown on alfalfa land in the longer rotations yield a net profit of more than $50.00. Sugar beets grown in rotation not having alfalfa or sweet clover nor receiving manure show a small profit, but when grown in rotations having either of these legumes or receiving manure they return a net profit of between $25.00 and $50.00 an acre. Returns from corn vary from a loss in the poor rotations to a net profit of $12.00 an acre when grown on alfalfa land. Small grain seldom shows a profit when grown on high priced irrigated land. What is true with reference to high acre yield under irrigation is also equally true under dry land conditions, although the relative yields may be less on dry land. Where it requires 125 bushels under irriga - tion to cover an acre cost of production it may require only 75 bushels per acre under dry land conditions. If this is true it is the bushels above these respective yields which make profit. There is perhaps a greater tendency among dry land farmers than is the case under irrigation to increase profit by increasing the acreage rather than by increasing the yield per acre. In too many cases the acreage on dry land farms is so large that potatoes do not receive the proper cultural care, and as a consequence the -yield per acre is re - duced.. The factor influencing yield is different under irrigation than that under dry land conditions, while the factors influencing quality are very much the same under both conditions. Under - irrigation the factor which influences yield most is soil fertility, while under dry land conditions it is available moisture. The soil fertility can be improved under irrigation by using alfalfa or sweet clover in the cropping system and the available moisture can be increased under dry land conditions by proper cultural methods. Perhaps foul land caused from the grow - ing of too many potatoes is the cause of poor quality more than any other factor. The cropping system in which potatoes are grown should be one in which potatoes do not come on the same land oftener than once in five or six years. The kind of seed used is also a factor in - fluencing both the yield per acre and quality of potatoes. Good clean potatoes from a high producing strain should be used under all condi - tions. If a farmer can make as much profit by growing 3000 bushels on ten acres as he can by growing 10,500 bushels on 70 acres, why pro - duce this extra 7500 bushels which increases the surplus and lowers the price ? </seg>
            <seg id="p671">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION COOPERATIVE POTATO MARKETING ASSOCIATIONS H. C. FILLEY, Professor of Rural Economics, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, Nebraska. Before discussing potato marketing organizations it may be ad - visable to review very briefly some of the salient facts concerning potato production and potato consumption. Knowing a commodity and the facts concerning the ordinary marketing of that commodity helps to explain the success or failure of the cooperative marketing associa - tions by. which it has been handled. Potatoes are produced in every one of our forty-eight states. They are produced most abundantly north of the Corn Belt. This is due in part to the fact that potato production is best adapted to regions where the climate is relatively cool, and in part to the fact that, except where there is a good local demand, they are- less profitable than corn. When the production of potatoes is small the price is relatively high, and when the production is large the price is low. A year of high prices, is almost invariably followed by a greatly increased acreage. The area where potatoes can be grown is very large. In no one season has as much as 5 per cent of the land suitable for potato production ever been planted to that crop. The quantity of potatoes which will be consumed at a price remunerative to the grower is limited to about 400,000,000 bushels. If the price of potatoes rises very high, con - sumption is decreased because the housewife will serve cheaper foods. A very low price does not stimulate potato consumption as it does the consumption of fruits and some other foods, because at ordinary prices nearly everyone uses all the potatoes for which he cares. Because potatoes are perishable, it is impossible to carry over a surplus from one year to the next. There is little demand for old potatoes when new potatoes can be purchased at a reasonable price. Any old stock carried over is, therefore, a total loss to the owner. It is impossible for any man or group of men to regulate the production of potatoes or "to fix" prices. The most that anyone can hope to do, whether grower or speculator, is to hold potatoes in short-crop years until de - mand forces the price upward. The marketing agency for table stock potatoes, whether cooperative or regular, which plans a long-time pro - gram upon any other basis than that of efficient service, is foredoomed to failure. Minnesota Potato Growers' Exchange Minnesota farmers. have experimented in cooperative potato mar - keting with somewhat varying success. Local associations, some formed as early as 1912, secured as satisfactory results as can be expected of an </seg>
            <seg id="p672">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE association with a small volume of business. In 1920 a large number of local associations organized the Minnesota Potato Exchange, following the same general plans as the Michigan Exchange. It got along fairly well the first season, but encountered such difficulties in 1922 that re - organization was imperative. The principal cause of the trouble was poor grading. Some of the locals shipped poorly sorted potatoes as No. 1. Rejections followed. Such shipments were necessarily sold for what they would bring, which in some instances was but little more than the freight and handling charges. Since all shipments were pooled, the average selling price was lowered. Men who had sent a quality product to market protested at such injustice. In the reorganization, pooling was abandoned, and the exchange operated largely on the com - mission basis. In 1923 plans were made for a new organization. It was proposed to secure a large number of members under an iron-clad contract, and proceed to "merchandise" Minnesota potatoes beginning with the .1924 crop. By the first of March of that year when the- preliminary organiza - tion campaign closed, 12,326 contracts, representing 161,543 acres of potatoes, had been received. The cost of securing the contracts had nearly consumed the $5 fee paid by each member. The marketing of the potatoes was necessarily financed by borrowing money. Storage space was secured for more than 5000 cars of potatoes. Warehouses were purchased, leased, or built at important shipping points. Those purchased and built were to be paid for within five years by making deductions upon all potatoes handled through each ware - house. Storage space was also secured in Chicago, Kansas City,- Omaha, and other important wholesale markets. The producers fulfilled their contracts and delivered their potatoes; during the digging season there were days when more than 150 cars were shipped. The selling of the crop proved to be a different matter. Before the end of the year growers were complaining of the delay in securing returns, and the murmur of discontent did not lessen with the approach of spring and the end of the old potato season. In September, 1925, the Minnesota Potato Growers' Exchange an - nounced that it would suspend operations so far as concerned the 1925 crop. The company was solvent, but internal dissension due to the low net returns made a continuance of operations impractical if not impossible. An unaudited statement of the operations of the Exchange for its first year was issued as of August 31, 1925. According to the tentative report, the association received and sold 6,215,112 bushels of potatoes. Net sales after allowances, freight, adjustments, and similar charges were deducted amounted to $2,369,122 or about 60 </seg>
            <seg id="p673">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION cents per hundred pounds. The following table gives other deductions made from the net sales: Net sales $2,369,122 General office expense - $154,170 Selling expense 177,449 Warehouse expense 813,849 Other expense 58,801 Investments 202,857 Legal reserve 48,681 Total deductions 1,455,807 Returns available to growers $ 913,315 Paid growers up to August 31 § 849,421 Probably available for final payment $ 63,894 According to this statement the growers had received on the average less than 14 cents net per bushel for their crop and could receive only about one cent per bushel more. Under such conditions there is little wonder that the members were dissatisfied even though the Exchange was able to meet its financial obligations. A number of reasons, some of which are as follows, have been advanced to explain the low net returns: 1. A ' large potato crop in 1924 which naturally reduced potato prices. . . 2. Bitter opposition from regular dealers who would lose if the Exchange succeeded. 3. Unduly high operating expense. 4. Unwise selling policy. Whether or not any or all of these reasons are the true ones, at least three very definite inferences may be drawn from the experience of the Minnesota Potato Growers' Exchange. 1. While the pooling of commodities by grade is often of assist - ance, it does not insure the success of a cooperative marketing venture. 2. Unless the members of a cooperative believe that they are re - ceiving an efficient marketing service and securing as good a' price as their neighbors who sell through regular market channels, they are certain to censure their association. </seg>
            <seg id="p674">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 3. An iron-clad, long-time contract neither insures loyalty nor a long-lived organization. In his speech on Conciliation with America, Edmund Burke said, "I do not know the method of drawing up an in - dictment against a whole people." It is likewise impossible to compel the enforcement of marketing . contracts when almost the entire mem - bership desire their abrogation. Cooperative Marketing of Potatoes in Maine The Maine Potato Growers' Exchange began operation in 1923 with 3100 members who grew approximately 50 per cent of the Maine crop. It handled 2,897,860 barrels of potatoes of the 1923 crop and 3,396,724 barrels of the 1924 crop. All potatoes were pooled by grade. The de - livery of potatoes by members was regulated, as was also the disposal of the crop. At the close of the 1924-25 year, the Exchange owned 34 warehouses with a combined capacity of 322,966 barrels. It also leased during the marketing season 154 warehouses with a combined capacity of 982,755 barrels. Each member was bound to the associa - tion by a contract which assured the delivery of his potatoes. At the 1924 annual meeting of the board of trustees, the legal department was instructed to prosecute vigorously all breaches of contract. They car - ried out their instructions and the courts sustained the contracts. In September, 1925, the Maine Potato Growers' Exchange suspended marketing activities. The members had received on the average less than 72 cents per barrel for the 1924 crop. Creditors who had sold fertilizers and other supplies on credit insisted that the 1925 crop should be harvested and marketed without delay. In the minds of many cred - itors and growers, the marketing policy of 1924 was not justified by the returns. Everyone will admit that the 1924 potato crop was larger than the country would consume at a price profitable to producers. The Ex - change could neither increase the demand for potatoes nor decrease the supply. The growers were most interested in whether or not the potatoes were marketed as efficiently through their own organization as through regular marketing channels. Certain it is that the long - time irrevocable contracts, the pooling policy, the attempt to feed the market, and the various other policies which have sometimes been heralded as the essentials of cooperation did not suffice to keep the company from .suspending marketing activities.

The fee for join - ing a local association is $10, and that for joining the Exchange is ?100. Each member of a local association signs a non-interest bearing note for $100 which may be used for collateral in securing additional operating capital. Each member of a local association signs a five-year contract in which he agrees to deliver all potatoes to his association except seed potatoes and those sold directly to consumers. A member may cancel his contract in June of any year. Nearly 9000 growers were members of the 75 units in 1927. . ■ The present contracts provide for pooling by local associations at the discretion of the members of each pool.

The influence of the Michigan Potato Growers' Exchange has been out of all proportion to the volume of business handled. It has never mar - keted more than 21 per cent of the total car-lot potato shipments from that state, and for two years it fell as low as 15 per cent. The first year that it operated, 1918, the margin between the price which Michigan farmers received for their crop and the Chicago average price dropped more than 40 per cent below 1917. The Exchange gave efficient service at a low cost to the grower. Other potato marketing agencies were compelled by the force of competition either to lower their margins or retire from the field. All growers have profited because of the initiative of the men who made possible the local associations and the Exchange, and assumed the. risk for the success of the venture. It is unfortunate that a few growers have been compelled to carry the burden and risk of the movement from which all have profited. Eastern Shore of Virginia Produce Exchange Eastern Virginia is well adapted to the production of potatoes, sweet potatoes, and a great variety of vegetables. The season is early and the East Shore farmers can always have produce ready for market in advance of the truck gardeners living near Philadelphia, New York, Boston, Pittsburgh, and other northern cities. For many years prices were low. This was not due to a lack of consumer demand, but to keener competition among the farmers in selling than among the produce men in buying. The produce buyers were not entirely at fault because each farmer established his own grades and the dealers could never be certain of securing uniform supplies. In order to remedy the unsatisfactory marketing conditions the farmers in 1900 organized the Eastern Shore of Virginia Produce Ex - change with headquarters at Olney, Virginia. It was a success from the beginning, and the region has prospered because .of the increased income which has been returned to the producers. The men who sell through the Exchange may be divided into three classes: (1) members, (2) tenants who live on land belonging to 'mem - bers, and (3) small growers who pay $1 a year for the privilege of selling through the Exchange. The members own the capital stock and agree to sell all their produce through the Exchange. Membership is desirable because the Exchange furnishes the best market, and the stock pays 10 per cent. Many of the small growers who pay for the marketing privilege are </seg>
            <seg id="p677">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION negro tenants. Ordinarily one-half of the net earnings remaining after paying the dividends on capital stock is placed in the reserve fund and the remainder paid out as patronage dividends. Everyone participates in the patronage dividend. White potatoes are sold in greater quantity than any other product. Potato grades were established by the Exchange many years ago. The present potato grades recommended by the United States Department of Agriculture are really a development of the Eastern Shore grades. The Exchange places all potatoes of a given grade in a daily pool. No attempt is made to hold potatoes or to "fix prices". The Exchange keeps in touch with the various markets and distributes the potatoes in accordance with known conditions. Sweet potatoes, strawberries, onions, and cabbage are among the products which are handled in considerable volume. In 1925 and 1926 business was not very satisfactory and the Ex - change sustained operating losses. Because of the previous prepara - tion for such lean years it was possible for the Exchange to write off the losses and yet have remaining a surplus of $227,000. The 1927 marketing season was favorable both in shipments and sales. A patron - age dividend of $42,050 was declared and the surplus was increased. The success of the organization has been due to following the principles of cooperation and the use of good business methods. The selling service has been ably performed at a low cost. There have never been any large fees paid to attorneys nor any large organization expenses. Employees have been paid salaries fairly commensurate with the salaries paid to other men for similar work. Returns to producers have been based upon what the products have actually sold for when delivered, and not upon the average price for which all products have been sold during the season. The man who has been able to catch the early market has received the full reward for his ability and industry To tell the whole story briefly, the organization has been conducted on a business basis. The Delaware-Maryland-Virginia Eastern Shore Association The success of the East Shore of Virginia Produce Exchange led to the formation in l?04 of the Peninsula Produce Exchange which covered two counties of Maryland. Although the Maryland potatoes were ready for market just a little later than the Virginia potatoes, their market - ing seasons overlapped and as a result there was for many years an intense rivalry between the neighboring associations. There were also independent dealers in the region covered by the two associations each striving for the largest possible share of the potato business. Potato dealers in cities farther north have naturally taken advantage of the competition between these various marketing agencies and purchased </seg>
            <seg id="p678">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE their potatoes at the lowest possible competitive price. In 1926 many growers received less than cost of production and began searching for some means of raising prices. Early in 1927 the Eastern Shore Farmers' Association was organ - ized in the two eastern shore counties of Virginia. Any producer might become a member by signing a copy of the Articles of Agreement, which required that they would not patronize any dealer or marketing agency who did not conform to the Articles of Agreement of the association. The affairs of the association were managed by a Board of Managers. One of the important jobs of the Board of Managers was to select a Quotation Committee of three persons. One of the members was chosen from two nominations submitted by the Eastern Shore of Vir - ginia Produce Exchange; another member chosen from two nomina - tions submitted by the Peninsula Produce Exchange; and the third member selected from two nominations submitted by the independent dealers or agencies of the Eastern Shore of Virginia. The chief duties of the Quotation Committee were to issue daily price quotations upon Irish and sweet potatoes, and to issue rules and regulations concerning loading and distribution. The association was not able to secure a complete sign up of either farmers or dealers. When the season was well under way a 1 large outside produce firm entered the field, bought potatoes and shipped them to outside markets. As a result, competition seemed about as keen as in former years. The backers of the movement believed, how - ever, that the Quotation Committee had been of great help to producers. In their opinion prices had held up better than they otherwise would have done. At the end of the 1927 season, steps were taken to improve the association. The territory was enlarged to include the farmers of the potato growing counties of Maryland and Delaware. A producers con - tract was formulated. The signatures Of 85 per cent of the potato producers in the area covered by the association were secured and the association was ready for the 1928 season. The story of the operations for the past summer can be told best perhaps by quoting from a paper read not very long ago by one of the association directors: "You are all doubtless aware of the extremely unsatisfactory conditions which have prevailed in the white potato market this year. The old potato crop for 1927 amounted to 268,584 cars, as compared with 236,612 cars for the season preceding. This represents an excess of 31,972 cars of old potatoes, which had to be marketed between the fall of 1927 and the opening of the early white potato crop in 1928. When it is re - membered that in 1926 the early white potato crops of South Carolina, North Carolina, Norfolk and the Eastern Shore amounted to only 30,000 </seg>
            <seg id="p679">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION cars, it will be seen that had no early white potatoes been produced in the four regions just mentioned, the markets would have had old pota - toes enough to take their place. The situation was even worse than this. Increases in production in these regions has resulted in a total production of approximately 6000 cars more than that of 1926. "The larf e volume of the old potato crop produced a low level of prices and extended the season of the marketing of the old potatoes until practically the first of July. This resulted in a low level of prices for early potatoes in Florida and other first early states. To make matters worse the South Carolina crop, which normally is marketed entirely in May, was this year marketed almost wholly in June; and the North Carolina crop, which in 1927 was 60 per cent moved before the Eastern Shore crop came into the market, this year tyad marketed less than 200 cars when the Eastern Shore season began. "The result of this culmination of circumstances has been that large volumes of potatoes have been thrown on the market almost daily since the opening of the Eastern Shore season, with resultant decline of prices. Although it is generally recognized that about 700 to 800 cars represent a fair day's shipment for the markets of the United States, yet on June 7, 8, and 9, the first three days of the Eastern Shore movement, there were marketed 4,138 cars, or an average of 1,379 cars per day. In the second week of the movement there were marketed 7,165 cars per day. In the face of such a situation there has been little that the Quotation Committee could do other than to resist, by every possible means, the steady decline in the prices, and to exert its influence to have the potato movement from the Eastern Shore spread out over as long a period as might be practicable. "The Eastern Shore this year fell heir to a market situation un - equalled in the history of potato growing there. In the first ten days of the shipment season, beginning June 6, the Eastern Shore shipped only 946 cars out of a total of 12,151 for the entire United States, South Carolina and North Carolina having furnished 6,155 cars, or over 50 per cent, while the Norfolk section added another 414 cars. ''As no practicable plan for regulating shipments from these several sections could be agreed upon, ah avalanche of potatoes has descended upon the markets. From June 6 to June 30, inclusive, covering twenty - two marketing days, 25,341 cars were placed on the markets of the United States, or an average of 1,152 cars per day. As a result there has been a steady decline in price until (on July 7) it was well below $1.50 per barrel, which is far below the cost of production. On July 11 and again on July 19 prices dropped to $1.00." The Del-Mar-Va association was unable to control prices for the very simple reason that they were unable to control either local pro- </seg>
            <seg id="p680">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE duction, or what was much more important, national production. Their holding of potatoes for a better price left- them with a large volume of potatoes on hand at a time when ordinarily the bulk of their crop had been sold. As a matter of course their organization was started in an un - favorable year, but the question remains as to the measure of success it would have achieved if started in a favorable year. Orderly Marketing It may be well to discuss orderly marketing at this time, because it is a subject that is mentioned very often by cooperative potato mar - keting associations. Orderly marketing is often discussed but seldom defined. It is one of the popular catch phrases of the cooperative charlatan who holds forth the possibility of price control. It is also one of the ends sought by cooperative associations that base their pro - grams upon the giving of efficient service. Orderly marketing is de - sired by primary producers, by transportation agencies, by wholesalers, retailers, and ultimate consumers. Not all who advocate orderly mar - keting have the same thing in mind, but the phrase is at least sug - gestive of an end that is greatly desired. .'■■"' ■".■ Orderly marketing has been defined as "the marketing of the com - modity at the right time, and place, in the right quantity and quality." Such a marketing program would eliminate gluts and famines. It would place every commodity on the market at the time and place that would give the greatest net returns to the producer. Products should be distributed among markets not only in proportion to the total quan - tity demanded, but in the proper quantity of the proper, quality. The orderly marketing of any important product is no small task. Orderly Marketing as to Time This is the phase of orderly marketing most commonly discussed. It is sometimes proposed that one-twelfth of some product should be placed on the market each month. This is, of course, absurd because consumer demand varies from month to month. For example, more nuts are consumed in the late fall and early winter than during the summer. In the cooperative marketing of soft-shelled walnuts and almonds this variation in consumer demand is taken into consideration and a very considerable part of the nuts are placed on the market in time for the Christmas holiday trade. Raisins, lemons, and fresh pork are three other farm products for which consumer demand varies ma - terially with the season. </seg>
            <seg id="p681">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION Orderly Marketing as to Place Orderly marketing does not necessarily mean an equal distribution of a product in proportion to either area or population. The demand for men's fur coats in New Orleans and for refrigerators in Labrador is very limited. Farmers purchase few fresh vegetables during the months when city residents purchase them most abundantly. An Italian residence district is a better selling place for grapes than a district inhabited by people of almost any other nationality. Orderly marketing as to place means, therefore, the placing of a commodity in the localities where a demand exists or can be created. Orderly Marketing as to Quantity Price depends primarily upon the relationship existing between supply and demand. If the supply of any desirable thing is increased without a proportionate increase in demand, sellers must lower the price; if the supply is decreased the price rises. An increase in demand causes prices to rise, and a decrease in demand causes them to lower. It is also true that an increase in price results in an increase in the quantity of goods produced and a lowering of the price of goods results in increased consumption. When the quantity of goods that buyers will take at a given price is the same as producers will offer at this price, we have a price that "clears the market." Orderly marketing of goods as to quantity means, therefore, that the quantity of goods of any given kind on a market at a given time should be limited to the amount that can be sold at a price satisfactory to the seller. If any product, and particularly any perishable product, is produced in large quantities it is easy to see that it may not be possi - ble to clear the local market at a price satisfactory to the seller. In order that such a product may be marketed in an orderly manner, it is often necessary to ship a part to other markets. Orderly Marketing as to Quality Not all persons can afford to buy goods of the finest quality, and many other persons are unwilling to buy anything except the best Orderly distribution demands that the quality product shall be sent to the quality market and the less desirable product to the market where it can be sold. The dime store and most exclusive shop are alike striv - ing for orderly marketing. Potatoes and Orderly Marketing Orderly marketing to the potato producer in Florida or southern Texas is primarily a question of getting his crop to the consumer be - fore new potatoes grown farther north enter into competition. The job (21) </seg>
            <seg id="p682">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE of the producer is to furnish as good a quality as possible at the earliest possible time. Quality is sometimes sacrificed to the desire to secure the early market. .The cooperative association or private distributing agency must send the potatoes to markets that are not already well supplied with new potatoes during the spring and early summer. Those that are dug first must be sent to a market where price is a secondary factor. As the season advances- and new potatoes become more common, quality becomes a more important consideration. The Eastern Shore of Virginia Produce Exchange achieved success largely by shipping potatoes as soon as dug to some city not already well supplied with new potatoes. Telephone and telegraph bills were large, but the association sold the potatoes as fast as dug and before the potatoes grown farther north could be placed on the market. One of the mistakes of the Maine Potato Growers' Exchange and the Minnesota Potato Growers' Exchange was the failure to realize how widely potatoes are grown and that while they were holding a perishable product in storage, in order to market it in an orderly manner, the growers in other regions were sending sufficient potatoes to market to supply the demand. When the potato crop harvested is larger than the amount of potatoes ordinarily consumed, orderly marketing is not a question of placing a given quantity of potatoes on the market each month or each week, but of growers who live close to consuming centers placing their crop on the market in ample quantity to supply demands and at a price which limits shipments of potatoes from distant regions. Under such conditions the producers who live farthest from consuming centers are sub-marginal, and their crop will be the least likely to be placed in the hands of the ultimate consumer. Cooperative associations assist in keeping poor potatoes off the market in seasons of surplus and thus make a better market for quality potatoes. Cooperative potato-marketing associations in the late potato ■ re - gions do need to consider time of sale. The size of the crop produced at home, the size and quality of the crop produced in other regions that compete in the same markets, the cost of storage, and the extent to which the present price reflects the size of the crop are all factors that need to be considered in formulating a program for the orderly market - ing of potatoes. . . Summary When we analyze the reasons for the success or failure of the vari - ous cooperative potato marketing organizations that have been formed, we find that the cooperative association that succeeds must perform the job of merchandising potatoes more efficiently than it is being per- </seg>
            <seg id="p683">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION formed by competing: potato marketing: agencies. The producers must receive as a result of this efficiency a larger share of the price paid for potatoes by the jobber or retailer. There are certain things that the well-managed cooperative organi - zation can do. 1. It can sell the potatoes to wholesalers or retailers in consuming centers and thus return to the producers the profits made by the dealers who usually buy in producing regions. 2. It can establish standards and insist that all potatoes marketed through the association shall be graded in accordance with these stand - ards. This helps to establish a reputation for the potatoes of a given region or for the cooperative brand. 3. It can equalize marketing risks by placing the potatoes in short time pools. 4. It can gain the advantages that usually accrue to the organiza - tion handling a large volume of business. 5. It can furnish producers with reliable market information. 6. It can give to its members the satisfaction of knowing that they have actually received for the potatoes the price for which they sold in terminal markets less transportation and handling charges. There are certain things that a cooperative potato marketing or - ganization cannot do. 1. It cannot "fix prices." 2. It cannot set aside the law of supply and demand. 3. It cannot control the quantity of potatoes produced in the United States or the quantity that is started to market on any given day. 4. It cannot maintain for any considerable number of years a large, inefficient,' expensive overhead organization and compel the members to pay the unnecessary cost. The marketing of potatoes by cooperative associations can be sum - marized by saying that such organizations have succeeded when they have secured efficient management and followed the generally accepted principles of cooperation. They have failed when the management has been inefficient or when the organization has placed undue emphasis upon "iron-clad" contracts, "orderly marketing," and price maintenance. </seg>

STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE THE WYOMING SEED POTATO INDUSTRY GLEN HARTMAN, Department of Agronomy, University of Wyoming, Laramie, Wyoming Gentlemen: I am indeed glad for the opportunity to meet with your organization and to assist in your potato show. I have enjoyed the work in your show and certainly appreciate the fine quality evi - denced by the exhibits displayed. I have been assigned the subject of "Cooperation Between Wyoming and Nebraska in Potato Certification." Time will not permit me to discuss this subject in detail. It is true that a short distance west of here is the Wyoming-Nebraska state line. However, this line does not greatly change the soil and climatic con - ditions. We believe we have the best area known for the production of seed potatoes. Wyoming and Nebraska are and probably always will be competitoi-s-in the seed potato industry. However, conditions of production are similar in both states, and by close cooperation and fair competition we feel much is to be gained. It really then is not a ques - tion of competition between Wyoming and Nebraska, but between this section and other sections of the United States. We feel that the market is large enough for all if properly developed as the industry expands. Nebraska is a pioneer in the potato certification in the west. And we wish to acknowledge an appreciation of her work along these lines. Some certified seed potatoes have been produced in Wyoming for the past nine or ten years. It is only during recent years that much organ - ized effort has been expended along this line. This year six thousand acres passed field inspections. To date, bin inspections are not nearly completed. This represents an increase of over 300 per cent over last year. In the few minutes which are left for me, I believe I could not do better than explain briefly how potato certification is handled in Wyom - ing. I am a member of the department of Agronomy of the College of Agriculture of the University. Our department has complete charge of certification, but do not, of course, handle any marketing of the crop. Marketing at present is handled chiefly by local organizations. • \[ Fees are collected from the grower by the department and. all in - spections are made by members of our regular staff. Two field inspec - tions are made at such times as diseases may be most readily detected in the field. Two bin inspections are also made. The first is chiefly educational. This inspection is to' help the grower with his sort. The last inspection is made after the potatoes are finally sorted and ready for market. It is at this time that the bags are tagged with the official </seg>

It is now long past time for adjournment, so I wish to again express my appreciation at having had this opportunity to meet with you. CERTIFIED SEED PROSPECTS WM. MORROW, Manager Nebraska Certified Potato Growers' Cooperative, Alliance, Nebraska. Last spring when acreage reports were received at the office, it became apparent that we stood a very good chance of suffering from overproduction of certified seed during this present marketing season. From eighteen hundred acres four years ago we had increased our plantings until forty-five hundred acres were applied on in 1927. This season reports covering eleven thousand acres were filed. Had an average yield per acre been realized, nothing short of calamity would have confronted us this fall, as we probably would have had over one thousand cars of certified seed potatoes. Weather conditions as well as a tremendous sort out has greatly reduced our anticipated supply, until it is doubtful whether we will have as many more cars than we did a year ago. Our low yield together with heavy sort out was probably a blessing in disguise. Expansion has been altogether too rapid to be healthy. The same conditions occurring in Western Nebraska have also been occurring in greater or less degree in other regions producing Triumph seed potatoes, North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Wyoming have all realized that there has been an exceptionally good profit in certified seed during the past few years and the tendency has been to increase production in all regions. We have always been able to secure a premium for Ne - braska certified seed potatoes over certified seed potatoes from other sources, but when the premium we ask becomes excessively high in the opinion of prospective purchasers, we are losing business to com - petitive states. This is a serious factor this year, as it is generally conceded that more certified Triumphs have been produced in the United States than will be readily absorbed by the south. We cannot expect a normal demand from the southern states this season. Judging from our business in the Rio Grande valley, we can expect just about half the total business that was received a year ago. Shortly af.ter the harvest of new potatoes started last spring, evidence of overproduction began to manifest itself in a continually declining </seg>
            <seg id="p686">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE market until the new crop would not bring freight. "When the higher cost of production in southern sections, occasioned by high seed and fertilizer costs, is considered, it is realized that the southern planter suffered a great deal more from low prices than we do in Nebraska. Many of them are unable to finance their ' potato plantings for the coming season. There are a good many home grown potatoes left in southern territories which will be used for seed this season. We must compare our industry with any other business enterprise. We are going to have our years of overproduction with consequent low prices and probable loss to the grower for the privilege of producing certified seed. The best policy which we can hope to follow is to avoid large fluctuations in acreage and to raise our potatoes, keeping in mind at all times production costs. If we are able to produce a bushel of certified seed potatoes for less money than the average grower, then we are in a more advantageous position to cope with the situation in years of overproduction. Some seasons prices will be such that the more efficient growers will make money while those who find costs of production of certified seed expensive will lose. The same policy is applicable when considering competition from other states. If we are able to produce certified seed of similar or superior quality to that of our neighboring states and at the same time produce it for less money, we will be in a better position to continue our industry and it will be - come more firmly established. Neither cost of production nor price per bushel can be figured. on a one-year basis. Unfortunately our production costs this year promise to be extremely high in spite of efforts made .to keep them down. Our fields were in excellent condition the latter part of July and promised a high yield per acre. Weather conditions from then on, however, seriously reduced our anticipated production and extreme hot weather and dry soil at harvest time caused very heavy damage to the potatoes. Experienced and careful growers who took every precaution to avoid injuring the potatoes were the victims of the situation as well as the new and less experienced men. * Our average sortout this season will probably be around 50 per cent because of these conditions at harvest time. Possibly in another season, under similar conditions, we could control the situation to some extent, but nevertheless, we have it and it must be considered a factor in our production costs. The past few years have indicated to us that a very large proportion of our produc - tion costs come at harvest time. If we are able to control scab and - mechanical injuries, we will have a much higher percentage of market - able seed and . consequently a much lower production cost.

WERNER, Professor of Horticulture, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, Nebr. ™ «£ thC f I tUre undoubtedl y P^toes will not hold as dominating a position in the operations of many western Nebraska farms as has been the case in the past years, especially in the earlier years when the western country was first devoted to agriculture. The advantages in diver 81 fication are becoming very apparent to the western Nebraska farmer. The production of corn and hogs as well as wheat and barley has been quite profitable during recent years. The serious prevalence of some potato diseases has increased the difficulties in the production of that crop. However, when all these things are carefully considered probably most farmers will decide that the potato crop will be retained lor many years as an important major crop. Many of the difficulties encountered in connection with the potato crop have been purely economic, due to the fact that much of the potato growing has been of a speculative nature. Consequently some people have made large sums of money from growing the crop and other people have lost quite heavily. The latter has probably been the case in many instances in 1922 and 1928. ■ Before proceeding with this discussion it might be well to consider just what is the function of the potato crop as related to a' western Nebraska farm, especially a dry land farm. Briefly, we can say that there are three important things to consider in connection with this crop: 1st— it is a good cultivated crop; 2nd— it is a cash crop, and 3rd— it provides profitable labor for the farmer over periods of time that would not be otherwise occupied. As a cultivated crop the potato is entitled to major consideration m these western counties. In most of these counties the summer grow- </seg>
            <seg id="p688">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ing season temperature from the period of June 1st to October 1st averages between 65 and 68 degrees F. While this ■ is probably the highest temperature which can be considered- as satisfactory for grow - ing a late crop of potatoes, most of the other late producing regions having lower temperatures,- it is still somewhat too low for the very best production of corn. We consequently -find that potatoes probably serve as a better crop in this respect than does the corn crop. It is of course needless to say that the inclusion of a cultivated crop is necessary for any successful system of continuous farming. The prin - cipal object of growing a cultivated crop is to keep -down the weeds which, under a system of continuous small grain farming, steadily encroach upon the land. A little later on we shall present data to show the relation of potatoes to the yields of crops following. Potatoes serve as one of the best cash, crops that can be grown on western dry land farms. In this connection it is especially valuable on farms where livestock production is a major industry. As most farmers in western Nebraska are well aware of the . value of the potato crop in this connection, it is needless to dwell upon this point any further. The third point worthy of some consideration is that the potato crop can be grown by a farmer without very much conflict for labor with the other farm crops. The potatoes are planted after the spring wheat and corn have been planted and before corn cultivation takes up any time. The place where there is sometimes serious conflict is in connection with the cultivation of potatoes and small grain harvest. However, if the potatoes are properly taken care of while the plants are still small there should not be very much necessity of cultivating potatoes when the small grain harvest demands attention; at least the need for cultivation should "not be so very urgent. In the fall of the year potato harvest does not conflict seriously with any other field operation, since the fall seeding of wheat will have already been done. During the fall and winter the potato sorting in the cellar serves as a profitable occupation. At this time many farmers would not have very much work to do that would fully occupy their time. If a farmer will sort his potatoes up to a good grade he will find it a great deal more profitable to do the sorting himself than to sell the potatoes field run to a buyer who must hire someone to do the sorting for him and who, of course, buys the unsorted potatoes on a safe margin. </seg>

            <seg id="p690">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE It may be of interest to study the potato crop from the standpoint of its value in comparison with other crops grown. For this purpose we will use the figures of Box Butte county because in this there is very little irrigation. So far as the production of the major crops is concerned, for all practical purposes, it is safe to say that there is no irrigation. Likewise Box Butte together with Sheridan county repre - sents the oldest farming district in the northwestern part of the state. In figure 8 the data concerning wheat, corn and potatoes for the last twelve years are graphically presented. These data are figured for each crop as the percentage of total acreage of cultivated crops and like - wise the percentage of the total value of cultivated crops that each crop represents. The crops considered as cultivated crops for the purpose of drawing up these graphs have been potatoes, corn, wheat (including spring and winter wheat) and oats. During the earlier years of this period barley did not figure in as a very important crop. During the last year or two it has become more important, but the omission of barley does not seriously disturb the figures. A careful study of these charts will be of interest and will reveal many interesting facts. For instance, the potato acreage of Box Butte county during this period never exceeded 25 per cent of the acreage of cultivated crops in the county, whereas the value of the potato crop was never less than 25 per cent of the total value of all these crops. There have been times as in 1921 when the potato crop was worth 65 per cent of the cash value of all of the cultivated crops raised. This suggests that since the potato crop is worth more per acre than the other crops it is worthy of quite careful attention. Another fact which is evident from figure 8 is that the percentage of the crop acreage devoted to potatoes (in Box Butte county) of the whole increased quite steadily until 1922 and then decreased until 1926 when it increased slightly to 1928, after which it will probably again decrease slightly. Much of the , recent decline in acreage when con - sidered on a percentage basis, was due not to actually fewer acres, but due to more new land being broken up during these years and this new land being used almost entirely for wheat. The percentage of land on any established farm, which was devoted to potatoes, has probably not dropped very much below 13 or 14 per cent or ty to % of the crop acreage. In view of disease problems and economic considerations, this is probably a wise procedure. During the period of time covered by figure 8 we find that potatoes represented 14 per cent of the crop acreage, but their value was 42.5 per cent of the total crop value. Corn occupied 29% per cent of the acreage and was worth 18.6 per cent of the total value of all of the crops concerned. Wheat occupied 33 per cent of the acreage and pro - duced 25 per cent of the total crop value. The figures with regard to value per acre are of casual interest. During the five-year period from </seg>

            <seg id="p692">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE In figures 9 and 10 the data concerning annual production and price for the last 16 crops of potatoes are presented. In view of the fact that Professor Filley has dwelt quite in detail with the factors affecting price of potatoes, I .will not at this place endeavor to analyze these charts. A casual glance at these charts indicates that the acreage, the production and the price have all varied very violently from year to year. Especially has there been extreme variation following such years as 1922 and somewhat earlier following 1928.

            <seg id="p693">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION two different bases. First I have figured the value of the crop that would be raised from 40 acres each year, using the yield per acre as estimated by the State Department of Agriculture and as is shown in figure 9 for each year and likewise' using the State Department of Agriculture figures on average price per bushel on December 1st on the farm (also shown in figure 9). On this basis of figuring the potato crop value we find that the potato crop from 40 acres during this period of time varied in value from $940 for the 1922 crop to $3,542 or $88.55 per acre. In view, of the fact that the potato acreage of many farmers fluctu - ates very much from year to year, I try to figure the probable income from potatoes from a farmer who would vary his potato acreage from year to year about the same as most people seem to have varied their acreage during those years. I therefore found the average acreage for Box Butte county for the twelve-year period and used this as a basis for other calculations. This average acreage I found to have been 13,028 acres. I next figured the percentage that the county acreage each year was of the average county acreage for the twelve years. I found that these percentages ranged from 58.4 per cent up to 210 per cent of the average acreage. We then applied these figures to the 40-acre proposi - tion of the individual farmer. We assumed that if a farmer was growing 480 acres of potatoes in the course of the twelve years and instead of growing forty acres every year (as described in the previous paragraph), he instead produced an average of 40 acres per year, but that his acreage each year fluctuated as did the county acreage. Thus in 1917 instead of growing 40 acres we assume that he grew 58.4 per cent of 40 acres or approximately 23 M; 1 acres and in 1922 his acreage instead of being 40 acres would have been 84 acres. Then after getting the acreage for each year, we figured the production from this acreage on the basis of the annual average for that year and then the value of these potatoes on the basis of the annual per bushel value for December 1 and then secured the figures as given in the last column of Table 2. By the fluctuating acreage plan it will be noted that the .value of the farmer's potatoes would have ranged from $1,264 to $5,423 per acre. This was a smaller range of value than when 40 acres were grown each year. The average value of the potatoes raised by the fluctuating acreage system was only $2,975 per year. Thus when a farmer averaged 40 acres of potatoes per year but had as low as 22 acres some years and as high as 84 acres some other years, his crop was worth $567 less per year; or secured on a percentage basis growing 40 acres every year resulted in the production of potatoes worth 18.8 per cent .more throughout a twelve-year period than when the average acreage was 40 acres, the total number of acres in twelve years the same but the acreage each year was above or below 40 acres. </seg>
            <seg id="p694">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The reason for the differences pointed out in a previous paragraph are principally that increases in acreage generally followed high prices the previous year, with the result that big production depressed the price. The 18.8 per cent increase in gross income by the consistent acreage system does not really represent the real difference in profits because these need to be figured as the fixed production costs have been taken care of. If profit figures were available they would probably show a still greater increase for the constant acreage system. Undoubtedly much of the fluctuation in the county acreage was due to the planting of large acreages of potatoes by farmers who were not in the habit of growing potatoes or by speculative ventures where outside capital was invested in a potato growing venture. It is quite likely that the average established farmer more nearly followed the constant acreage scheme. Some of the more experienced farmers prob - ably at times reduced their acreage slightly, following years of high prices. This is probably a wiser system than increasing the acreage at such times. However, it is not to be considered as a sole solution for stabilizing the price. Probably we have dwelt upon this phase of the problem sufficiently to establish the fact that potatoes will yield a reasonable profit over a period of years if they are considered as a permanent crop and not a speculative proposition. Some figures from the North Platte Experiment Station are of considerable value in pointing out the relation of potatoes to the yields from other crops in the rotation. In the case of winter wheat during a 17-year period the average yield of winter wheat following potatoes was 18 bushels per acre, as. compared with 15.4 bushels per acre fol - lowing wheat and 27.2 bushels following summer tillage. In the case of spring wheat the yield after spring wheat was 11.3 bushels, after corn 11.4, after oats 11.7, and after potatoes 13.8 bushels. In the case of oats the yield after wheat was 24.8 bushels, after corn 29, and after potatoes 34.4 bushels. It was noted in connection with the oats crops that when fallow preceded the potatoes, oats were benefited by the moisture carried over, but this did not occur when wheat followed the fallow crop. Some figures dealing with the yields of potatoes at the North Platte Station during a 17-year period may be of some interest. How - ever, since potatoes are raised as an early crop at North Platte they cannot be considered as applying very definitely to the production of late potatoes in western Nebraska. During a 17-year period potatoes after winter wheat yielded 111 bushels per acre; after summer tillage </seg>
            <seg id="p695">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION 116.6 bushels and after oats when fall plowed, 103 V4 bushels and when disked, 93.6 bushels. From these figures it is quite evident that the small grain farmer should figure the value of the potato crop not only in terms of potatoes produced, but in terms of increased crop production following potatoes. The disease situation in connection with potato crop has been dis - cussed at length at numerous previous meetings. It is probably suffi - cient to say at this time that scab and wilt seem to be the most serious soil borne diseases that need to be dealt with in some of these western counties. Due to the fact that facilities have not been available for conducting proper experimental work, we are not able at this time to give any information relative to the length of crop rotations necessary for the control of these diseases; neither can we tell whether we really can look to crop rotations for any very material relief. On the basis of observations, however, it appears that on many farms, relatively long rotations, that is five or six years between potato crops, will be of considerable value in reducing the amount of these diseases. It appears unwise for any farmer to plan to more or less permanently devote 20 per cent of his acreage to potatoes. It will probably be of more importance to him to improve production methods so as to in - crease the yield per acre rather than to increase the acreage of potatoes.

I guess you are already posted on what the program was so I will just take time to tell you about the things that interested me and that will help me in after life. "The first day, which was Monday, held no especial interest for me except that L. C. Oberlies' talk was very good. "Tuesday morning I saw through a demonstration what other poul - try clubs were doing on the line of clean feeding and watering. I </seg>
            <seg id="p708">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE learned many little tricks on how to make sanitary feeders and waterers. Next I heard Dr. John Holland talk on top notchers, from which I learned that if anyone wanted to do anything in life you should have a goal at the very top and strive toward that point. "Wednesday we took a tour of the poultry plant in which I learned many things about feeding equipment, sanitation, egg production and the pedigreeing of chickens, but the thing that inspired me most was how easy it was to raise turkeys if proper care was taken of them. For instance, the only way I knew of raising turkeys was to give them plenty of range and let them live and eat with the chickens,, but I found cut that even setting the eggs under chickens or raising them in the same lot would give them the blackhead, which is killing the. largest per cent of our turkeys. I also found how little it cost to feed them and that there was big money in them if they were kept in good tight small pens clear away from chickens or ground where chickens had been. "Thursday I saw a chicken cut up and the egg making part of it explained, which will help me in knowing what kind of feed is best for egg laying hens. Knowing how the eggs are made will make it more interesting for me to feed and work with my hens to get more eggs. "Thursday afternoon we went jon a tour of the agriculture campus. The livestock division was of the most interest. "Friday we went to Omaha and visited the packing house, where I saw how the animals were taken care of from the time they were killed until the time they were cut up, cured and ready for market. "Of course there were many other entertainments which I enjoyed very much, and without them Club Week could not have been a success, but these that I have mentioned were the ones that did me good and will do me good for years to come.

THE SECRETARY: I might add a word in connection with Mr. Porter's question by saying that we were not entirely satisfied with the settlement by any means, but we . were simply the victim of circum - stances — that is, the circumstances were such that we had absolutely no control over them, inasmuch as part of the coops were in Hastings here, having been sent here from Sidney, where they had been used at a former show, and the differential between what we had on hand here and what burned should have been the amount that we received from, the insurance company. MR. PORTER: Would it have been more than the eleven hundred and some odd dollars? j THE SECRETARY: We thought so, yes, but we had no way of proving it; and Mr. Jackson, who has charge of our funds in that con - nection, and whose very heart and soul is in this particular association, saw fit to settle on the other basis, and there was nothing to do but settle on that basis; and I hesitated for almost. five months before - signing a voucher for this, and it was very late before we even got the check fos the amount that you heard read here.

            <seg id="p714">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE SECRETARY KNUDSEN: In closing, Mr. Chairman, I would like to say a word or two. There are quite a number of members of the Adams County Poultry Association present. We have had a' most splendid meeting in Hastings, but it is probable that we will move to another section of the state next year. I say "probably," and if we do, I did want to extend to you an invitation to be present and show your birds wherever we happen to go. That is the thought that comes to me now. I believe the state in general has been pretty good to Hastings. From my part of the state — Douglas county — we brought, I think, 125 birds.. Now, if that same spirit. can be made to prevail in every one of these sections throughout the state where we hold our show, they will not be able to speak of the show as going backward, but instead you will hear it said that there is not enough room to accommodate the exhibits. I am not disappointed with the kind of birds here at all. We struck some bad weather and sickness, and even in the face of that we have a mighty fine show. The thought that I wanted to get over and the thought that I wanted to leave with you is that we do not want to lose our contact with you people just because we might not come back to Hastings. We have established ourselves pretty well here, two years in succession, and we want the feeling to prevail and go along with us wherever we go that you are interested. Mind you, I am not saying that we will go elsewhere. I personally want to thank you for the splendid treatment that I have had here, and I believe I can thank you on behalf of the entire Board. We have had a most profitable week, although I haven't myself had much time to get over to the show room, yet I probably know about what is going on just the same. And we are coming back to Hastings some of these days if we don't come back next year. That is all I have to say. , . ■ MR. NORBERG: Mr. President, I would like to have the Nebraska State Poultry Association extend a vote of thanks to the Adams.

THE PRESIDENT: I think that is a good idea'. Does anybody second that motion? MR.

FAUSCH: On behalf of the Adams County Association, I extend to you an invitation to come back here next year if possible, or as soon as possible thereafter. We are glad that you came this year and are glad that you have enjoyed this visit with us, and I am sure' that the rest of the members of the association will back me up in wel - coming you back again as soon as possible. (Applause.) MR. ELLIS: The Hastings Chamber of Commerce invites you to come back to Hastings any time that you want to come, and we will try to do as much for you as ever before. The Adams County Poultry Association voted unanimously to back up Mr. Fausch and myself in anything that we did in order to make things pleasant for you here, and the president and .secretary of the Chamber of Commerce also did the same thing, and I leave it to you whether we succeeded or not.

            <seg id="p716">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE POULTRY IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION President Dudley Beck, Decatar ; Secretary :D. Z. Holcomb, Clay Center The following papers were given at a meeting of the Poultry Im - provement Association held during Organized Agriculture week, Janu - ary 7th to 10th, inclusive, 1929, at the Agricultural College, Lincoln, Nebraska. ■ 1 A STATE POULTRY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM WALTER J. BUSS, President Ohio Poultry Improvement Association Let us go back into rather recent Ohio poultry history to see if there was really any need for poultry improvement work in Ohio. Sup - pose, for instance, that you were an Ohio farmer who decided eight or ten years ago that your flock wasn't just all that it might be from the profit standpoint. You had been reading the farm papers, attending farmers institutes and, perhaps, going to the farmers' week programs at the university, and had been continually told that in order to make the maximum profit from your poultry operations it was necessary to keep a flock that was bred for production. You were just a bit hazy about all the terms that were thrown at you, such as production bred, trapnested, pedigreed, 200-egg sires, pedigreed matings, sires from dams with no records, culled flocks, and a host of others. You heard and read so much about all these things that you de - cided there must be something to this production bred stuff and that perhaps you were wrong in thinking that a chicken was a chicken, and that the reason you didn't get a high production from your flock was because you just didn't have any luck with chickens. Anyway, it was worth a try. So you probably decided to buy some chicks of this newer kind that had egg production bred into them. You got together the farm paper and one or two poultry journals and looked over the advertisements. After a short time you decided that the job was going to be mighty easy. Here were a dozen or two advertisements of stock that included </seg>
            <seg id="p717">NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION all the words that the writers and lecturers had been telling you were necessary in a profitable flock. They were all culled, trapnested, pedi - greed 250 or 300 egg strain, and had all the other desirable character - istics. After looking them over carefully,, you decide that the adver - tisement of the Jones Poultry Farm of Podunk Center apparently had the best stock, so you sent them a postal card asking for a catalogue and price list, which the advertisement said would be sent to you free, stamps appreciated. After getting the catalogue, you are sure that you picked the right .place. It was a beautiful catalogue and went into much more detail than the advertisement about trapnested, pedigreed, 300-egg strain and all the rest of that stuff that you were looking for. And the prices weren't so bad. Their A grade chicks, which they recommended very highly, and which were pedigreed from 275 to 329 egg hens and sired by beautiful male birds with thirteen generations of 300 egg blood cost only 30 cents each. You decided to go the limit and get in at the top, as the catalogue said, so you bought 500 of these chicks. . r They didn't look so peppy when they came, but then you decided that this highly bred stuff from such high record dams probably shouldn't be expected to be as strong as ordinary dunghill stock, so you tried your best to raise them. They didn't live real well, but you finally raised 250 of them. After selling the cockerels and culling a few of the scrubbiest pullets, you had 100 pullets. Along about the middle of October you began to wonder why egg production wasn't any better than in previous years. The disappointment continued to grow as the winter advanced and egg production remained low. By early spring you decided that you had better go to see Mr. Jones' beautiful flock of high producers and, perhaps, he could tell you what you had done wrong in raising your chicks. You get up early one bright spring morning and drive to Podunk Center, park your car on the square, and ask the first man you see the directions for reaching Jones' Poultry Farm. He looks blank and says he never heard of the place. You decide that he probably is a new - comer in this vicinity and ask. the second man you see, with the same result. So you decide that the banker will probably know. Upon in - quiry you find that Mr. Jones lives in the second block down on this street. Yes, the banker informs you, Mr. Jones carries a substantial balance in this bank, pays his obligations promptly and is a good citizen of the town. So you drive down to the house, expecting that Mr. Jones will want to take you out to the poultry farm, and you will offer to drive your car so as not to put him out too much. You are rather sur - prised after introducing yourself, to find that Mr. Jones desn't seem especially glad to see you. But, to make a long story short, you find that the- extent of the Jones Poultry Farm is an office at the rear of </seg>
            <seg id="p718">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD. OF AGRICULTURE this house. Upon diligent inquiry you learn that they do not have a chicken anywhere in the world, that the only incubator they have is a 240-egg oil machine stored in the basement of the house, that they buy chicks wherever they can buy them the cheapest, and, if pedigrees are demanded, make them up in the office. This, of course, would be an extreme case. There were not many operating on this basis. But it didn't take many. Their advertising was so strong that they caught a large number of the unwary. Having no production cost and buying surplus chicks at their own price, they could spend a very large amount of money for advertising and in this way get a new crop of suckers every year. It was so much easier to claim these things than to actually do trapnesting and produce improved stock, and the claims, hampered only by the imagination, were, so much greater than actual results that the poultrymen who were really trying to do an honest job of flock im - provement were up against an almost insurmountable' obstacle to dispose of their honest stock with honest advertising when competing with these imaginary flock records. Progress in improvement of Ohio farm flocks was so slow as to be absolutely discouraging. It was plainly apparent that if any appreciable progress was to be made, something had to be done. Some work was being done by the University poultry department with certified flocks. This work, similar to that done in many states by the poultry department in co-operation with breeders, and with which you are no doubt familiar, consisted in working with a 1 selected lot of breeders. Requirements were that all males used must be pedi - greed from 200-egg dams or better, and that the females in the breed - ing flock must be selected by a representative of the poultry depart - ment from a flock upon which a feed and egg record had been kept for a year. This work, showed that progress could be made in the improve - ment of a' flock, but the work was not satisfactory as a means of im - proving the' entire poultry population of the state, because these certi - fied flocks were not large and there were very few of them. After giving this matter considerable thought, Prof. E. L. Dakan, head of the Poultry Department at Ohio State University, decided that in order to make rapid progress in the improvement of Ohio farm flocks it would be necessary to work through the hatcheries, of which our state has a very large number. Accordingly he called a conference of a considerable number of people in the state representing the gen - eral poultrymen, certified flock owners and hatcheries. As a result of this and later conferences the Ohio Poultry Improvement Association was organized in the summer of 1924. The object of the organization as given in its constitution is "to establish and maintain an organiza- </seg>
            <seg id="p719">NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION tion by means of which members of all branches of the industry may effectively work together for the betterment of the industry as a whole." In order that there might be no question as to the legality of its con - tracts the association was organized under the laws of the State of Ohio governing co-operative agriculture activities. As originally con - stituted, the association dealt with general poultry activities, certified flocks and accredited hatcheries. In 1926 the Record of Performance work was added. The government of the association is vested in a board of directors consisting of nine members. The interests of each group of the asso - ciation, that is, general activities, certified flocks, record of performance flocks and accredited hatcheries, are looked after by a committee of five members. These committees and the board of directors are chosen as follows: The members of each group elect four committeemen from their numbers to serve on their respective committee and the head of the poultry department appoints the fifth member of each committee. The two committeemen from each group who receive the highest num - ber of votes serve on the board of directors, and the head of the poultry department appoints the ninth member of the board. The head of the poultry department has been elected secretary of the association, but has no vote on the board of directors. By this method of organization the poultry department of the University, hav - ing one out of five members oh each committee, and one out of nine members on the board of directors, cannot control the actions of the organization or of its various groups, but is enabled by this representa - tion on the board and committees to keep in close touch with the activi - ties of the organization. There may be some question as to just where is the best place to hook up this poultry improvement work. In some states, notably Wisconsin, this work is done under supervision of the Bureau of Mar - kets. In our state the Bureau of Markets . is in the Department of Agriculture and is, therefore, subject to political changes in the state government. It is plainly apparent that this work should have a hook-up with some responsible state agency, and our experience indicates that it should not be connected with any agency that is subject to political changes in the state government. You can imagine for yourself what the result would be when the Poultry Improvement Association is under fire, as ours is at present, if it were subject to political influences. There would certainly be some sidestepping for political expediency. This wcrk should be so organized that there need be no sidestepping for any reason — that the actions of the organization need be governed by no other principle than what is right. </seg>

            <seg id="p722">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The association is financed entirely by dues and fees from its mem - bers and pays all of its expenses except, as you may have noticed, that the poultry department at the University furnishes office space. We will discuss the fees and dues a little later on. Membership requirements in the association are "Any resident of Ohio interested in promoting the object of the association may become a member of the association by paying a membership fee of $1 per year." We required that every accredited hatchery owner, every certi - fied flock owner, every owner of an R. O. P. flock and every flock owner who sells eggs to an accredited hatchery must be a member of the association. The membership of the association is a little over 3,000. The large majority of this membership consists, of course, of flock owners who sell eggs to an accredited hatchery. The most important officer of the association is the field manager. That, folks, is. a real job and takes a man with considerable ability, to say nothing of diplomacy, to handle it. Upon the performance of his duties depends very largely the success or failure of the organiza - tion. Our association has been very fortunate in the selection of its field managers. For the first two years we had Mr. T. S. Townsley, whom many of you doubtless know. Mr. Townsley was extension poultryman for a number of years in Missouri, and managed a large breeding farm in that state for two years before taking up our work. When he resigned to go into commercial work the association employed in his stead Mr. G. S. Vickers, who was extension poultryman in Ohio for six years. Mr. Curtis, in his ramblings in the Reliable Poultry Journal, has criticised the association for having the foresight to select for field manager a man who had the confidence of Ohio poultrymen. The association pays its field manager at present a salary of $4,400 and pays his necessary traveling expenses, so you see we can command the services of pretty high class men for this position. The two lines of work that are doing most for the improvement of Ohio poultry are Accredited Hatcheries and Record of Performance work. In the Record of Performance work we are able to find the good stock and through the Accredited Hatcheries we diffuse the blood of this good stock through a very large number of flocks. In the fifty-eight accredited hatcheries in Ohio we have this year incubator capacity of over three and one-half million eggs. These hatcheries will produce close to ten million chicks, assuming that the hatching season will be normal or nearly so. Unfortunately, or should I say fortunately, not all hatcheries in Ohio are accredited. Around 20 per cent of the chicks produced in commercial hatcheries in the state are accredited. This does not seem like a very large percentage, but </seg>
            <seg id="p723">NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION 681 still, ten million chicks annually cf accredited quality will make quite a dent in the poultry population of the state in the course of a very few years. Sc much for the direct results of this work. The indirect results are even greater. While a large percentage of the hatcheries of the state have not come in under accreditation for one reason or another, still, due to competition from accredited hatcheries, the non-accredited hatcheries are operating on a much higher plane than they did five years ago. While, at that time, practically all hatcheries were adver - tising that they were getting eggs only from carefully culled, free range, healthy, high producing flocks, this was more or less— mostly more— Jones Poultry Farm bunk. At present most of them are actually culling their flocks, and improving them with good male birds. When we consider all this, it is hard to visualize the actual value in dollars and cents of the accreditation work to the poultrymen and poultry - women of the state. Briefly, then, to operate an accredited hatchery a man must send the men who are to do the culling of his flocks to a culling school con - ducted by the poultry department at the University. This school lasts five days. At the close of the school these men must satisfactorily pass an examination on the courses that have been taught them at the school, and this isn't a mere matter of form — they don't all pass. These men then handle every bird in the flocks that produce eggs for the hatchery, putting a sealed association band on every bird that they deem suitable for producing hatching eggs. After they have finished culling, the association sends an inspector to go through every flock to see that the men have done a good job of culling and remove any birds that he does not consider qualified to remain in an accredited hatchery breeding flock. The inspector must also be satisfied with the health of the flock and sanitation and feeding methods, or he discards the flock. The accredited hatchery owner must submit all advertising, includ - ing catalogues, circulars and newspaper advertising, to the field manager for approval before it is published. If the field manager finds that the hatchery is advertising as facts some features of their operations that are not justified, he tones the advertising down to the actual facts. He must also keep his hatchery and surroundings in a sanitary condition, keep records of eggs set and chicks sold, disinfect his in - cubators, and submit to inspections of the plant by the field manager at unannounced intervals.

            <seg id="p724">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Now, then, the item that we are usually interested in, What does it cost? We have been operating on the following schedule of fees and dues: An initiation fee of $1 per 1000-egg capacity. An annual membership fee of $60 for each hatchery. An annual capacity fee of $2 for each 1000-egg capacity in excess of 25,000, the membership fee covering the first 25,000-egg capacity. . One cent for each leg band. • ;• The actual money cost, then, for a 60,000-egg hatchery would be $226 the first year and $175 thereafter. If he hatches two chicks per egg capacity during the- season, the cost is less than one-fourth cent per chick. This does not include the labor of culling, but since he has been culling his flocks anyway, according to his advertising, this would not add to the cost of accreditation. In Ohio we charge the flock owner the cost of the bands, which would reduce the above cost to one-tenth of a cent per chick after the first year. For smaller hatcheries, the cost is a little greater, because the annual membership fee of $50 is the same in all cases and for hatcheries of less than 25,000 the cost per 1000 eggs capacity would be relatively greater than $2. On this scale of fees the work has maintained itself and we have a surplus fund of $5,700 which is drawing interest and is being main - tained to give this movement a sound financial basis, and to be used if an emergency develops. In addition to the above, the members voted to assess themselves an additional 50 cents per 1000-egg capacity, the money thus secured to be used in doing publicity work. With this money we hire a publicity director. This publicity does not involve the purchase of advertising space, but the writing of interesting news stories about the accredited hatchery work, which are offered to the farm and poultry papers for publication, if they see fit to use them. The critical might be inclined to call this press agent work or the spreading of propaganda, but it is really legitimate publicity. You will remember the mousetrap story that some man — perhaps it was Emerson — wrote a good many years ago. Well, frankly, that story does not hold in the baby chick business and, in fact, in most other businesses at the present time, because competition is considerably keener in most lines than it was in the mouse trap business at the time the story was written. If you have a good article, you simply have to tell the world about it, or there won't be any beaten paths to your door. Our publicity director, Mr. Harry O'Brien, whose articles you have all read in Country Gentleman and Farm Journal, insists that there are a lot of good news stories in </seg>
            <seg id="p725">NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION Ohio accredited hatcheries, and that the world is entitled to know about them. The newest activity, now two years old, of the Ohio Poultry Im - provement Association, the one which undoubtedly will have the greatest influence in improving: the production of our farm flocks, is the Record of Performance work. The object of this work, as given in the Record of Performance contract is "for the purpose of promoting, fostering, and encouraging the production of high quality breeding stock of known high egg production; to stimulate trapnesting and pedigree breeding; to give recognition to honest trapnest records, and to create a demand for pedigreed hatching eggs, baby chicks and breeding stock." In Record of Performance work, the flock owner does his trapnest - ing in the usual way, except that instead of simply making a mark opposite the hen's number when she lays, he marks the hour when the egg is gathered. The reason for this is that it affords an excellent way of detecting inaccuracies or inconsistencies in the egg record. Investi - gators have found that hens behave in a regular way in producing eggs. It is very unusual for a hen to lay eggs less than twenty-four hours apart. The majority will lay twenty-six to thirty hours apart A normal performance for a hen that is laying a cycle of four eggs will be 8 o'clock-10-12-2 and then skip a day and start at 8 o'clock again on the following day. A longer cycle usually runs 8-8-10-10-10-12-12-2-4-skip. A heri that is laying' cycles of twenty to thirty eggs -will lay the first few at 8 o'clock, then quite a few at 10 and 12 and toward the end of the cycle at 2 and then at 4. If, after laying at 4 o'clock one day, the trapnester records an egg at 8 or 10 the next day it is plainly apparent that there is something wrong with his accuracy or his honesty. Another important requirement for Record of Performance work is that the eggs from every pullet must be weighed for one week during April, June and September. The trapnester who is not in Record of Performance work may or may not pay much attention to egg weights. If we are to believe all the advertisements we see, most of them are weighing eggs religiously, and a peculiar fact is that the eggs of pullets not under supervision are much heavier than those under super - vision. . . The association employs a man designated as the ROP Supervisor, whose duty is to make unannounced visits to each flock, take charge of the trapnesting for a day, or longer if there is anything suspicious, check up on the total egg production compared with recent daily pro - duction, compare the fowls with the records that the flock owner has recorded for them since his last visit, check up on egg weights, note color and shape of eggs, and so forth and so on. This man you will readily agree is a mighty important factor in Record of Performance </seg>
            <seg id="p726">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE work. It requires a man who has been well trained in all phases of poultry husbandry, and a man who has common sense, tact and diplomacy in large amounts. He must also have something of the detective's com - plex. In Mr. E. J. Meister, who is our ROP supervisor, we have a man who measures up exceedingly well to the requirements of the job. After the year's records have been completed, the year running 365 days from the time each hen lays her first egg, if the hen has. made a record of 200 to 249 eggs, if the average of the egg weights taken a.-, indicated heretofore is 23 ounces per dozen or more, if the eggs are satisfactory in shape, color and shell texture, and if the hen is free from standard disqualifications and of good type for the breed, the supervisor bands her as being suitable for an approved Record of Per - formance breeder. If her record is 250 eggs or more, and' she measures up in every other respect, she is banded with a different band to indi - cate that she is qualified to be used in an advanced Record of Per - formance breeding pen. The above records apply to all females of the Mediterranean varieties. With other varieties the required record for approval is 180 eggs. - An approved Record of Performance breeding pen is made up of females that have been approved as above, mated with males individually pedigreed from dams with records of 225 eggs or more and sires with dam's record of 200 eggs or more and must come from ROP matings or other sources approved by the supervisor. It is plainly apparent, therefore, that chicks bearing official Record of Performance wing bands have a right to be proud of their parents. The requirements for Record of Performance breeding pens and for the production of Approved Record of Performance males as given in the contract may be of interest. Again, you may be interested in the cost of this work to the flock owner. Because of the continual inspection requirements the cost is relatively high as compared with the cost of accredited hatcheries. The minimum fee is $125 per year for each flock. This covers the expense en flocks up to 250 birds. Then there is a charge of 35 cents for each additional bird up to 500; 30 cents for each bird from 501 to 750; 25 cents fcr each additional bird from 751 to 1000 and 20 cents for each bird over 1000. The cost of Record of Performance supervision, there - fore, is $125 for 250 birds; $212.50 for 500 birds; $287.50 for 760 birds and $350 for 1000 birds. Fees are based on the number of birds in the flock on January 1st at the beginning of the laying year. In adidtion to this supervision fee, the flock owner pays for bands used on the birds and for record sheets. This cost will be about $30 for 1000 birds. </seg>
            <seg id="p727">NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION The charge for the supervision of a breeding pen, including the supervision of hatching records and approval of the males produced, is 25 cents per hen in the breeding pen. These charges have come just a little short of meeting the expenses of ROP work, and will probably have to be revised upward slightly to make the work entirely self-supporting. In conclusion, I should like to offer the suggestion that through the hatchery is the quickest way to disseminate the blood of these high class Record cf Performance male birds. A Record of Performance flock in connection with an accredited hatchery makes an ideal combina - tion. Trapnesting is an expensive job. It requires the attention of one person every two hours every day in the year. The demand for pedi - greed male birds, while it is increasing, has not been large enough to make it possible to realize prices that will pay the cost of production, excepting perhaps the few good cockerels that are produced from very high record hens. When trapnesting and pedigree hatching is done in connection with a hatchery, the hatchery can absorb the cost of produc - tion cf pedigreed males and thereby have a supply cf these males for use in flocks that furnish the eggs for hatching. When a hatchery lets it be known that only pedigreed males from 200-egg dams are used in its breeding flocks, the price which chicks will bring will pay a nice profit over the cost of producing the pedigreed males. The days of the hatchery which does not have a breeding program of some kind to improve the egg production of the chicks produced are, indeed, numbered. WHAT I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW ABOUT THE POULTRY INDUSTRY E. B. HEATON, United States Egg Society, Chicago, Illinois An industry which has passed the billion dollar mark is truly big even in this age of stupendous figures. This egg and poultry industry is not only big, but it is more extensive in its makeup than any other. The units of production run into the hundreds of millions, and the work - shops into the millions. It is this farm workshop that we are most in - terested in and have so. much to learn about. A study of the working tools — the chickens, the turkeys, the ducks and the geese — in the farm workshop is worthy of the keenest research minds in America — as also is a study of the products therefrom and the part they shall play in keeping our American people properly nourished. Furnishing eggs and poultry meat for human consumption is the service rendered to the nation by the poultry industry. Food is most necessary. Selling service in the form ofToods such as eggs and poultry </seg>
            <seg id="p728">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE meat so necessary to the life of the nation places a great responsibility en poultry farmers, packers, distributors and retailers. The quality of the product represents the true measure of service. What I would like to know today is, will the poultry industry con - tinue to strive to furnish the consumers with a quality product and make every effort to continually improve the quality? When we consider the job of producing quality eggs and quality poultry meat we have many problems facing our industry that are real problems. Can we satisfactorily answer the following questions: "What are the more important factors affecting the quality of eggs and poultry meat such as watery whites, weak yolks, discoloration of yolks, uniform eclor cf yolks, strength of shell, growth of chickens, fleshing properties cf chickens, etc. ? " "What are the factors which affect the keeping quali - ties of eggs and poultry at different stages of marketing?" "What is the dietetic value of eggs and of poultry meat?" "What are the funda - mental causes cf the declining vigor of common farm poultry, its in - ability to resist diseases when exposed to them and failure to respond profitably to finish feeding and what are the most practicable and widely effective means for restoring natural vigor?" Take the last of these questions relative to the declining vigor and associated disease problem. Do we really appreciate the seriousness of this problem? It has been estimated that- during the past fall and these winter months that $15,000,000 worth of poultry have been turned back to the farmers by country dealers as being unfit for human con - sumption. Legislative measures have caused the packers and other handlers of poultry to refuse this poultry. Producers owe it to them - selves and to the industry to see that this unfit or cull poultry does not reach market channels. Much poultry is, however, accepted which should not be marketed. It is a loss somewhere and the burden of this loss is ultimately borne by the producer. As one dealer has said: "The dealer in the end is compelled to make an allowance in his price for any sickness or death rate the dealer has in his feeding station." Now, you who are interested in production sometimes forget that your interest extends beyond, the time when yon sell the poultry or eggs to a dealer. Tou may feel that when you have delivered the poultry or eggs and received the money the deal is closed, but that is not so by any means. If poultry dies on the dealer's hands or if eggs are thrown out in candling or if the railroads suffer an excessive loss in damage claims on eggs shipped from Nebraska, the farmer is interested. Why? Sim - ply because what the dealer pays or what the consumer will pay or IT ■ </seg>
            <seg id="p729">NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION what the railroad will charge for freight all depends upon the cost of dcing business. The farmer can reduce the cost I want to be practical this morning: and not waste your time in talking about how to reduce railroad claims, for example, unless the farmer can do something' about it. You may think that there are others who are closer to that business and who can scratch their heads for new ways to improve the handling of eggs and poultry, including good packages, good loading, proper icing, etc. I want you to feel that when I say the farmer can do a good deal toward reducing freight claims on eggs I am talking common sense. All the tests that I have heard about, made by carriers and package manufacturers, who are interested in reducing egg damage claims, talk a great deal about thin - shelled eggs. They are trying to find a way to market thin-shelled eggs safely. Now, wouldn't it be simpler for the farmer to quit producing thin - shelled eggs — and they can. There are people who can tell you how, and you all know it can be done. And there are other losses during marketing that lower the farmers' price even more than thin-shelled eggs, serious as that may be. You people who are thoughtful know that it is the only way to market eggs and poultry in which the fanner will have any incentive at all for trying to produce better eggs and poultry. He must be paid for the extra work and extra cost of good breeding stock. These things pay for themselves only if the farmer has a good market. There is an old saying that God helps him who helps himself, and this applies to the egg and poultry farmer. I wouldn't like to compare our Nebraska dealers with the Almighty, but it is certain that almost any dealer would think seriously before he would refuse to buy eggs or poultry on grade if the farmer demanded it- Farmers can demand many things. They can command a market to quite an extent by working together to improve production, having in view the consumers' wants. If I were asked to name the three most profitable reforms for Ne - braska poultry farmers by which to improve their market returns, I should name: First: Produce uniform eggs and poultry of good average quality. This implies as many farmers as possible getting together around a given shipping point and agreeing among themselves to special - ize on some one breed for that locality. The number of breeds and variety of eggs and poultry offered to dealers are discouraging. Seccnd, I should consider community studies, how to cut out all wasteful practices leading to high cost. Spread that knowledge. Lead- </seg>
            <seg id="p730">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ership in that work would probably fall on the county agent in Ne - braska. Third, I would encourage pride in the condition in which each farmer brings his or her eggs and poultry to market. Make it a com - munity disgrace to run down your neighbor's market by carelessness of any kind. Nebraska poultry farmers, the women I mean, should organize them - selves into a vigilance committee in each community to make good eggs and poultry the town talk. We have got to hand it to these profesccrs and others who have speeded up the hen by breeding for production. Feed men have shown us how to supply her with just the right proportion of raw materials so she will net waste any energy in producing eggs. The hen is a part of nature and subject to natural limitations of climate and the limitations imposed by demands of her own nature. When forced to lay eggs at the hardest time of the year there is a cer - tain amount of strain on nature and we can't overdo it. We can put too much emphasis on mere number of eggs without thinking cf the effect of forced production on the quality of the egg meat and en the quality of the chicks hatched. Last fall, in Chicago, the manufacturing bakers of this country held a big convention at the Stevens Hotel. For three afternoons" they studied the use of eggs in. cakes; they had sponge cakes baked from March and April eggs and sponge cakes baked from June and July eggs. The March and April egg sponge cakes were much larger than the sponge cakes baked from June and July eggs. That shows why the hen instinctively uses her March and April eggs for hatching her young. They are heavier-meated and have higher viscosity, so the bakers have fcund, and you hatcherymen have found that the March and April eggs are better for hatching. We can learn a great deal from each other. A consumer is the first to notice any improvement or decline in quality. Next to the consumers are the distributors and packers of eggs and poultry, who are as close as or closer than any other group in the poultry industry to the real problems which the farmer has to meet. They are first to recognize a lowering or bettering of quality, a change in breeding in a territory, the presence of disease on farms, the standard of vitality in farm flocks and the raising or lowering of seasonal production. The buyer of products is closer to the producer than any other agency. The packer as a buyer of eggs and poultry is closer to the farm flock owner. than other groups in the industry. </seg>
            <seg id="p731">NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION The widespread effect on the part of packers in some states to buy eggs and poultry on grade is bringing the packer even closer to the poultry flock owner and his problems. During the past two or three years the packer has stood tremendous losses in handling poultry in his feeding or fattening stations. In many cases this loss has been due to excessive death rate from infectious bronchitis. Even where death losses were not excessive it has been found impossible to attempt to try and fatten birds more than a few days where formerly they could be fed in the feeding batteries for twelve to fourteen days. The poultry does not seem to have sufficient vitality to stand up under battery feeding as in former years. The packer is helpless to cope with this problem without the co-operation of all agencies in the industry. The packers have gathered together a fund of $35,000 per year for three years with the idea in mind — speaking plainly — to combat the disease problem. This fund we realize is very meager when we consider our billion dollar poultry industry, but the raising of that money shows that the packers are interested in your problems. The first principle of good business is service to the consumer, the constant idea of delivering the highest grade of eggs and poultry at the lowest price possible. I am conscious that neither packers nor farmers always see it that way, but any improvement of the product or lowering of the cost of production and marketing means added profits for the poultry farmer of Nebraska. Your first and last step and every step between ought to bring you and the packers close together. The producer has to take the initiative in solving problems that are peculiarly his own. One of them is how to satisfy the consumer and encourage him to eat more. The packer can help, perhaps, but that problem is peculiarly a producers' problem because it is all tied up with the quality of the product and the cost. I shan't ask you to accept that statement without a reason and a proof that poultry farmers are the most deeply concerned about satisfy - ing every reasonable want of the final buyers, or consumer. The financial success of the poultry fanner depends first and last on an expanding industry. Any farmer stands with his back against a wall fighting for his life, the demand for whose product is not expand - ing. That is the nature of agriculture. The packers and distributors, on the other hand, haven't so much at stake. They buy and sell on the same market, so to speak. You don't need any array of figures for proof that the per capita consumption of eggs has fallen behind that of thirty years ago in this </seg>
            <seg id="p732">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE country. More eggs are produced on farms, but far less are produced in villages and cities. Cities have grown out of proportion to the re - mainder of the country. More eggs are stored, and the commercial farmer has enjoyed a certain expansion due to falling off of the back - yard production. Per person, on the other hand, fewer eggs and .less poultry are eaten than were eaten thirty years ago. One reason they are eating less is because good eggs and poultry meat are too high. Another reason is that eggs and poultry meat are net good enough quality. We don't give enough attention to quality. With eggs — too many eggs are handled case run through country stores and small independent produce buyers who do not have refrigeration facilities. No other highly ' perishable food is handled so largely by antiquated methods as are eggs. Under such conditions there is no incentive for producers to furnish better eggs. Alvan Oderkirk, Assistant in Poultry and Egg. Marketing, Iowa State College, has recently said in this regard, "The most prejudice against buying on grade in Iowa, naturally, arises from the small, in - dependent produce buyers and the stores. The commission basis of paying the station operators for some dealers serves to prevent many of them from instituting any new practice in buying eggs from farmers, while they must bear the brunt of store competition, as well as other non-grading agencies. "The stores resent the idea of graded buying of eggs because of the extra labor and time which would be required if they were to grade eggs. Also, the fact that they would need to employ someone who knew how to candle and grade eggs has been one of the principal argu - ments advanced by store buyers. While admitting the improvement which general graded buying of eggs would have upon egg quality in the middle west, most grocers are strongly against such a practice. "The writer asked forty or more Iowa store owners the following question during September, 1928: Would you continue to buy eggs from farmers if it were not for the fact that your store competitors force you to continue in the egg business? The larger number of these grocers answered the question in the affirmative, stating that the farmer trade gravitates to the place where he gets the best trade price for his eggs, often regardless of the price he is paying for his purchases of groceries or dry goods. "Several grocerymen explained that, if it were not for eggs, there would be a considerable part of their credit accounts which would not be settled. Others held that chain store and mail order house competi - tion compelled them to buy eggs if the farmer trade was to be kept in the hands of locally owned agencies." </seg>
            <seg id="p733">NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION Mr. Oderkirk has brought up a vital question. Can we have quality «ggs under such a system? Eggs and poultry will have to be bought on a graded basis if we -are ever to be assured of enough quality eggs for the consumer. The eggs will also have to be put under refrigeration as quickly as possible after the time they are taken from the nest if they are to retain their freshness. Refrigeration from the farm to the consumer's table will mean, quality eggs and quality eggs will mean increased consumption. In conclusion let me say that to bring about changes for the better and to find the answers to some of the problems we have suggested we must depend on our splendid agricultural colleges and experiment -stations. You are indeed fortunate in having such a splendid college of agriculture in Nebraska. I do, however, think that considering the size of the poultry industry in Nebraska that you could logically ask your legislature for more money to use for poultry research and poultry ■extension work. I would like to see a nation wide growing interest among poultry producers in the value of scientific research into the fundamentals of •egg and poultry meat production. With this demand would come ade - quate funds and increased facilities. Instead of the meagre ten to twelve thousand dollars per year which each of our middle western agricultural experiment stations are getting each year to use for poultry research investigations they would be getting amounts commensurate with the size of the poultry industry in these several states. ■ THE MARKETING PROBLEM AS THE PRODUCER SEES IT B. F. PRESTON, Lincoln, Nebraska Four hundred million dollars is the approximate valuation placed Tipon our annual market poultry crop. This is exclusive of eggs, which nearly double the amount. Is there any reason why we shouldn't be interested in the market conditions? Poultry may be marketed direct to the consumer, but a high quality product is usually demanded. We believe it pays to develop the high quality stuff, as our experience has proven that the average consumer, especially in the larger cities, is ■willing to pay a premium for quality stuff. But, because the necessary equipment and facilities for fattening or finishing are not available, there is a very small amount of poultry marketed this way. The bulk of market poultry is sold to local dealers, who start it on its way to the consumer via the shipper, packer, wholesale dealer, jobber and retailer, and as many other middle men as can be crowded in. In every local dealer's place of business you will find a sign reading, "'No sick or thin birds bought." If they would adhere strictly to this </seg>
            <seg id="p734">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE rule and pay a better price (which they could well afford to do) for the well fattened and healthy birds, instead of having John Jones, a mighty good customer, come in with about one-third of his birds sick or so thin they cannot be handled any way without a loss, and say well he is a good customer; we will have to buy all of them or offend him, and keep the price down to cover their loss to such a level that we can't afford to develop good stuff. We feel we are going to be unable to stress the point of marketing the finished product direct to the consumer strong enough, but we feel this is the only way the poultryman and farmer in general will be able to continue in the business. Just one example of our sales last-Thanks - giving: The dealers were quoting live geese at 16 cents; we. dressed one goose that weighed eleven pounds and marketed it at 30 cents per pound, making three dollars and thirty cents received for the bird that wculd have brought us $1.76 on foot, making $1.54 for less than one hour's work — almost a mechanic's wages. There are always plenty of people, especially in the cities, that are willing to pay the price if you have quality stuff and prepare it ready for the oven, and will let them know you have it. f\ • ' Have you ever stopped to think what a favored, bird the common old barnyard hen. is? First, the all wise Creator gave her a pair of wings, to liken her to our good angels; then he taught her the old maxim cleanliness is next to godliness, and she has always given to the world one of the finest breakfast foods on the market, delivered in a self-sealed individual package. Then she was given a wonderful pair of lungs. Is there any sweeter music than she gives us either as a solo or in a chorus of from one to five hundred? And last, but not least, He whispered in her ear, it pays to advertise, and she has been giving us everything she has since. Proper management, one of the essentials of profitable egg pro - duction, is a trite statement, for that is one of the necessary things for any successful business venture. Management includes watchfulness over every detail of the poultry plant, from the time the baby chick is hatched until the egg is marketed. Improper management means that something somewhere along the line at some time is going to be done or omitted which means the difference between a profit and a loss. The hen that manufactures annually ten times her body weight cf food will not stand neglect, neither can we afford to neglect the marketing of this product after the hen has delivered it to us. Pcultrymen are their own worst enemies when it comes to market - ing eggs, because many of them sell their eggs in a way that beats down the price level which they would otherwise secure if they would work with their fellow poultrymen and not compete against them. </seg>
            <seg id="p735">NEBRASKA STATE POULTKY ASSOCIATION The biggest problem confronting not only poultrymen, but agricul - ture in general, today is that of distribution or marketing. It is im - portant, therefore, for the poultryman to study the question of market - ing and distribution, safeguard the consumer's welfare and to so handle and distribute his eggs and so work with his fellow poultryman and the egg consumer that he will realize the full value of his egg crop. We believe we should have a uniformity of market grades through - out the country and all trade channels and stop the juggling of grades; encourage better understanding and more general use of grading rules and improve the quality of the eggs by keeping the houses clean and provide clean nests and gather them often. We believe a strict grading of market eggs (if the buyers would give us our grades as they grade) would so improve the quality that average personal consumption would be greatly increased, to the ad - vantage of all interested in the poultry industry. When a consumer of eggs sees the unsanitary conditions under which some eggs are produced, or sees a flock of diseased birds, he involuntarily thinks, or says, no eggs for me if that is the way they are produced, and consumption is again curtailed and the producer is the loser. Occasionally we can hear some people say that they round up their eggs on rainy days or on Saturday when the children are home from school. This is partly to blame for our straight farm-run egg market today. We believe co-operative market is the only salvation for the poultry - man and the farmer in general, notwithstanding the fact it has been a failure in this locality, yet we believe when it is organized with the sole idea of benefiting the producer, and not organized for the purpose of furnishing employment for some one looking for a job, that it can be successfully put across. ■ However, the solution of the problem lies within the industry. It cannot be solved by the dealer or any outsiders; the problem involves elimination cf wasteful production, practices, control of surplus and creation of a less extravagant distribution system. </seg>
