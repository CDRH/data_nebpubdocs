            <seg id="p005">SUMMARY 1. Improvement of Turkey Red winter wheat was begun at the Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station in 1902, after that variety had been established as the most winter-hardy and productive then available for Nebraska conditions. 2. The investigations herein reported suggest that nothing is to be gained by the practice of continued selection within a pure line. All that remains to be done after the initial selection of strains is the further comparative testing for relative excellence. 3. Eighty strains of Turkey Red wheat tested during 8 years, 1910 to 1918, in well-replicated nursery plats, ranged in grain yield from 7.4 per cent less to 23.7 per cent more than the original Turkey Red. Thirty^one of these strains were tested for yield in 5-row nursery blocks during the 9-year period 1914-1922. They ranged in yield from 5.3 per cent less than the original Turkey Red to 12.3 per cent more. Thirteen of these strains each yielded above 8 per cent more than the common Turkey Red. The detailed data indicate that, probably due to the combination of experimental error and seasonal effects, strains may rank widely different in different years, and tests must usually be of several years duration before dependable comparative results are secured. 4. In a 12-year field plat test, 1912-1923, comparing the most promising Turkey Red selections of this Station with the best Nebraska-grown varieties, the original Turkey Red was surpassed 3.8 bushels or 12 per cent by Nebraska No. 6, 2.9 bushels or 9.1 per cent by Nebraska No. 60, 1.7 bushels or 5.4 per cent by Red Russian, and 1.4 bushels or 4.4 per cent by Kharkof. 5. In a 7-year nursery test, 1915-1922, comparing 49 varieties and strains obtained as the most productive hard and soft wheats from 15 different State Experiment Stations and the United States Depart - ment of Agriculture, Nebraska No. 6 and Nebraska No. 60 again showed marked superiority in grain yield over the ordinary Turkey Red, which they surpassed 9.9 and 11.6 per cent. The outstanding variety of this test, however, was Kanred, which averaged 19.5 per cent higher yield than common Turkey Red. Crimean C. I. 1435, which is the original variety from which Kanred was selected, yielded 10.9 per cent more than common Turkey Red, while South Dakota No. 144 Turkey Red surpassed the common Turkey Red 11.9 per cent. Both of these are commercial (mass) varieties rather than pure strains and should prove of exceptional value for making further selections. </seg>
            <seg id="p006">6 Nebr. Agr. Exp. Station, Research Bulletin 31 6. Of 25 hard winter wheats included in the above 7-year test, 22 equalled or surpassed the common Turkey Red. Of 24 soft to semi - hard sorts, only 3 yielded as well as the original Turkey Red. The 25 hard winter varieties and strains averaged 31.9 bushels per acre compared with 27.2 bushels for the 24 soft to semihard varieties. 7. In a 4^year field-plat comparison, 1920-1923, Turkey Red was surpassed 1.8 bushels by Kanred, 1.6 bushels by Nebraska No. 60, and 1.2 bushels by Nebraska No. 6. In a 3-year test, 1921-1923, Blackhull has yielded 2.1 bushels less than Kanred. 8. Thirty-one strains of Turkey Red wheat tested annually for protein during 1916-1922 ranged in average protein from 14.7 to 15.5 per cent. The annual variation in average protein for the 31 strains and original wheat was from 10.8 to 20 per cent. Twenty-five varieties and strains of hard red winter wheat grown at the Experiment Station during the 6 years 1916-1922 averaged 21 per cent protein in 1918 and as low as 11.5 per cent in 1921. Twenty-four soft to semihard varieties tested during the same period of years ranged from an average of 21.8 per cent in 1918 to 11.8 per cent in 1921. 9. Three different groups of Turkey Red strains were tested for yield when grown individually during 9-year periods in comparison with 3 mechanical mixtures of the same strains. As an average for the 3 tests, the mechanical mixture yielded 0.3 bushel or 1 per cent more than the average of the strains grown pure. The highest-yield - ing individual strains of each of the 3 groups, however, averaged 1.5 bushels higher yield than the strain mixtures. It may be con - cluded that the most productive strain grown pure is more profitable than a mixture of high-yielding strains. 10. In a 6-year milling and baking test, 1916-1918 and 1921-1923, comparing the two Turkey Red strains Nebraska No. 6 and Nebraska No. 60, which have been distributed extensively to farmers, with the original common Turkey Red from which they were selected, the average loaf volume of Turkey Red has been 2158 c. c. compared with 2038 c. c. for Nebr. No. 60 and 2043 c. c. for Nebr. No. 6. In turn, the original Turkey Red averaged 31.2 bushels per acre dur - ing these years against 35.4 and 34.6 bushels for Nebraska No. 60 and No. 6, respectively. 11. In a 3-year test, 1921-1923, comparing Kanred with Nebraska No. 6, Nebraska No. 60, ordinary Turkey Red, and Kharkof winter wheat, Turkey Red surpassed the other varieties in protein and loaf volume, but the slight superiority in these regards was far more than offset from the grower's point of view by the increased yields of Kanred, Nebraska No. 6, and Nebraska No. 60. </seg>
            <seg id="p007">Winter Wheat Investigations 7 From the combined standpoint of yield and milling and baking value, Kanred and Nebraska No. 6 and No. 60 may be considered as having approximately equal value under average eastern Nebraska conditions. On the basis of yield alone, Kanred has a slight advantage. Marquis spring wheat produced a much stronger flour in this test than any of the winter varieties, but the yield of grain was only 44 per cent as large as for Turkey Red. 12. In a 3-year test, 1920-1922, comparing 10 representative varieties of hard red winter with 11 representative varieties of soft red winter wheat, grown comparably at the Experiment Station, the hard group averaged 6.5 bushels higher in yield, but it was only slightly superior in milling and baking value. Individual varieties differed greatly in strength of flour. South Dakota No. 144 Turkey Red ranked highest in these milling and baking tests and second in grain yield. There was no close correlation between the total protein con - tent of a variety and its baking value. 13. The percentage of crude protein in wheat grown in different years does not appear to be a dependable index to the baking strength of the flour produced. Considerable lack of correlation between these two factors has been noted thruout these investigations. Nineteen strains and varieties grown comparably during the 3 years 1916-1918 averaged 11.2, 10.8, and 14.3 per cent protein in 1916, 1917, and 1918, respectively. Corresponding baking tests for these 3 years were respectively as follows: water absorption in making dough, 60.3, 61.5, and 63.5 per cent; loaf volume, 2080, 2053, and 1955 c. c; loaf weight, 502, 513, and 511 grams. The corresponding average grain yields per acre were 47.2, 37.2, and 19.1 bushels in 1916, 1917, and 1918, respectively. In a similar test during the 3 years 1920-1922, 10 varieties of hard winter wheat averaged 14.8, 11.6, and 17.4 per cent protein in 1920, 1921, and 1922, respectively. Using somewhat different baking technique during these 3 respective years than in the previous com - parison, the corresponding water absorption in making the dough was 63, 64, and 66 per cent; the loaf volumes were 1821, 1829, and 1832; the loaf weights were 480, 484, and 483 grams. Eleven varieties of semihard winter wheat, grown comparably dur - ing the same period, averaged 14.9, 11.8, and 17.5 per cent protein in 1920, 1921, and 1922, respectively. For the same years the respective water absorption percentages were 61, 59, and 65; the loaf volumes were 1811, 1769, and 1880 c. c; and the loaf weights were 472, 470, and 485 grams. 14. A milling and baking test of Kanred and Nebraska No. 60 Turkey Red winter wheat grown at 8 planting dates, during each of </seg>
            <seg id="p008">8 Nebr. Agr. Exp. Station, Research Bulletin 31 the 3 years 1921-1923, indicates no pronounced correlation between protein content and baking value. The effect of delayed planting was to reduce grain yields without a compensating increase in baking value. No effort to control baking value of wheat thru planting date would seem justifiable. 15. Harvesting wheat before full maturity in the early and late dough stages during a 4-year period, 1920-1923, failed to increase the protein content of the grain, or to give consistently superior milling and baking results. The accompanying reduction in grain yield would not justify premature harvesting in an effort to improve the milling quality. 16. In a 2-year test, 1922-1923, early preparation of the seed bed proved advantageous from the standpoint of both baking strength and yield of grain. 17. Manure applications at the rate of 8 tons every 4 years failed to affect the milling and baking qualities of Turkey Red winter wheat materially, but increased the grain yield 4.5 bushels per acre. 18. An outstanding, early maturing, short-strawed variety of wheat was produced by selection following hybridization between bearded Turkey Red winter wheat and beardless Big Frame wheat. This hybrid ripens about one week earlier and is 6 inches shorter than either parent. It is decidedly less winter hardy, has a softer grain, and has yielded 8.8 per cent less than Turkey Red. Because of its earliness and short straw, this wheat is of interest in further hybridization in an effort to produce a special-purpose wheat where these qualities may have special value. Several especially winter hardy and smut resistant varieties have been established for hybrid - ization purposes. 19. In an effort to improve the yielding capacity of Turkey Red wheat by introducing the element of competition and elimination of the weaker strains in the seed plat, wheat has been grown con - tinuously since 1912 at the heavier than normal seeding rate of 8 pecks per acre. Parallel with this 8-peck seeding, other seed plats have been continuously seeded at 3 pecks per acre and at the normal 5-peck rate. In a 9-year yield test in which the 3 lots have been compared at the normal 5-peck seeding, the previous 3, 5, and 8-peck rates yielded respectively 34.1, 33.8, and 33.9 bushels per acre. 20. In a 5-year test, 1919-1923, of gravity and screen fanning mill separation of seed grades, using a pure strain of Turkey Red wheat (Nebraska No. 6), the following acre yields of grain were obtained: (1) ungraded seed, 31.1 bushels; (2) largest one-fourth seed, 31.7 bushels; (3) smallest one-fourth seed, 30.5 bushels; (4) heaviest one - fourth seed, 30.7 bushels; and (5) lightest one-fourth seed, 30.0 </seg>
            <seg id="p009">9 Winter Wheat Investigations bushels. Compared with these seed grades, shrivelled seed secured from either badly rusted or immaturely harvested fields yielded 31.8 bushels per acre. In an earlier 12-year test of gravity separation of both Turkey Red and Big Frame winter wheat seed grades, the original, heaviest one-fourth, and lightest one-fourth seed averaged 33.5, 33.9, and 33.0 bushels per acre, respectively. During the entire 17 years of testing grades of Turkey Red wheat the ungraded, heaviest one-fourth, and lightest one-fourth averaged 33.4, 34.0, and 33.6 bushels per acre, respectively. 21. In a 10-year test of the effect of seed size upon yield, dis - tinctly large and small grades of seed have been hand selected from common Turkey Red. These two grades have been compared annually with the unselected seed by planting all in equal numbers and in equal weights of seed per acre at a normal rate for the large seed. Tested at equal numbers of seed per acre, the large, small, and unselected seed yielded 35.7, 32.8, and 34.5 bushels per acre, respec - tively. When equal weights of seed per acre were sown, these respec - tive yields were 35.7, 34.3, and 36.8 bushels per acre. 22. It has been shown in Sec. 21 that the disadvantage of the smaller grades of seed when compared with large seed in equal numbers of seed per acre may be materially lowered by seeding equal weights of seed per acre. It has been determined in a 4-year test, 1920-1923, that this is probably due to the fact that small seed pro - duce somewhat less productive individual plants than large seed. The effect of this lower individual plant yield is reduced by having more plants per acre. When space planted to permit maximum plant development, the individual plant yield from large seed surpassed that from small seed 23 per cent as an average for the 4 years. 23. In a date-of-seeding test with Nebraska No. 60 Turkey Red winter wheat extending over 5 years, 1919-1923, during which Hessian fly was not seriously prevalent, the maximum grain yield was obtained by seeding September 22. This yield gradually reduced to a com - plete failure with 7 succeeding planting dates extending thru the fall, winter, and early spring. The average acre yields were as follows: Sept. 16, 32.1 bushels; Sept. 22, 34.2 bushels; Oct. 1, 32.2 bushels; Oct. 16, 25.1 bushels; Oct. 31, 20.2 bushels; Nov. 25, 16.7 bushels; Feb. 9, 11.8 bushels; March 4, 5.5 bushels; and March 25, 0.1 bushel. Low yields following late seeding or greatly delayed germination because of dry soil appear to be due to lack of fall stooling and to retarded spring development and maturity which subjects the crop to greater drought, heat, and rust complications. </seg>
            <seg id="p010">Nebr. Agr. Exp. Station, Research Bulletin 31 10 Associated with the reduction in yield from delayed planting, a rather gradual reduction in bushel-weight and an increase of protein - content took place. In years of Hessian fly prevalence, seeding should be delayed until the latter part of the normal planting period which usually corresponds with the " fly-safe date." 24. In a corresponding date-of-seeding test with Kanred winter wheat, the same general results were observed as with Nebraska No. 60 Turkey Red. Kanred, however, tends to ripen a day earlier and yield slightly more than Nebraska No. 60 at the fall-seeding dates and becomes relatively 1 to 2 days later heading and ripening than Nebraska No. 60 when seeded in the late winter or early spring, and the yield also becomes relatively lower. Java spring wheat yields approximately the same when seeded at its optimum date of Mar. 25 as does winter wheat seeded 2 months later than normal, whereas, winter wheat seeded Mar. 25 is a total failure. 25. There may be a wide range in seeding rate of Turkey Red wheat without a correspondingly marked effect upon yield. Seeded at the rates of 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 pecks per acre, the respective yields have been 28.6, 30.4, 30.5, 31.5, and 30.7 bushels per acre as a 5-year average, 1919-1923. The amount of stooling per plant is closely correlated with the rate of seeding. In this 5-year test, the number of stools developed in the fall and the number persisting May 15 have been respectively for each rate as follows: 3 pecks, 5.0 and 4.3 stools; 4 pecks, 4.4 and 3.2 stools; 5 pecks, 4.1 and 2.6 stools; 6 pecks, 3.8 and 2.5 stools; and 8 pecks, 3.3 and 1.8 stools per plant. 26. A semihard variety named Marvelous, which is a synonym of Fulcaster, was extensively exploited and grown in southeastern Nebraska during the past decade. It was especially recommended for an alleged stooling capacity far greater than that possessed by other winter wheat. Because of this alleged quality a planting rate of only 2 pecks per acre was recommended as optimum and for this reason it also became known as " Half Bushel Wheat." In a 5-year rate-of-planting test, 1916-1920, the 5*-peck rate surpassed the 2-peck rate 4.5 bushels in case of the Marvelous and 3.1 bushels in case of Turkey Red. The Turkey surpassed the Marvelous 3.7 bushels at the 2-peck rate and 2.3 bushels at the 5-peck rate. 27. In a &amp;-year test, 1919-1923, the average yield from broad - casting Turkey Red wheat was 24.4 bushels, while drilling in rows spaced 8 and 4 inches apart yielded respectively 29.7 and 29.8 bushels per acre. Most farm drills space the rows 7 inches apart, which is regarded as a very satisfactory width. Closer spacing adds to the draft of the drill without increasing the production. </seg>
            <seg id="p011">Winter Wheat Investigations 11 28. Turkey Red winter wheat rolled in the spring with a corrugated roller when growth is resumed yielded 31.6 bushels per acre during the 4 years 1919-1922 compared with 31.7 bushels for no treatment. On the other hand, harrowing lowered the yield 1.2 bushels with a crop of 30.5 bushels per acre. -An earlier 4-year test, 1902-1906, had indicated an increase of 5.1 bushels for spring rolling and a reduction of 0.9 bushel for spring harrowing. Spring rolling has been considered beneficial in years of severe cracking and drying of the soil, and in case of very loose soil. 29. Pasturing rank-growing Turkey Red wheat in the spring of 1919 from March 31 to April 30 increased the yield of grain 4.7 bushels per acre or 33 per cent. Corresponding unpastured wheat was a foot high at the time the cattle were removed and was lodging badly. Wheat mowed to a height of 5 inches at this time yielded 2.1 bushels or 15 per cent more per acre than the unmowed. Lodging was somewhat reduced by both the pasturing and the mowing. Pasturing wheat in 3 other years, when no lodging occurred, from the time it was 9 inches tall until April 30 reduced the average yield 12.9 bushels per acre or 32 per cent. 30. Caution must be exercised in spring pasturing or mowing, to avoid such treatment at too late a date. Lodging may sometimes be advantageously reduced by such treatment under conditions of very rank growth. The danger lies in the grazing or cutting off the wheat heads which emerge with early growth from beneath the soil. Many of the heads have commonly reached an elevation of 2 inches above ground by about April 30 under experiment station conditions. These heads are enclosed within the leaf sheaths and are only visible upon dissection. In a spring-clipping experiment covering 6 years, clipping on April 30 to 5, 3, and 1.5 inches above the ground yielded 27.2, 25.4, and 20.1 bushels per acre compared with 28.7 bushels for the undipped. Clipping on May 5 to 5, 3, and 1.5 inches yielded 19.9, 16.5, and 11.0 bushels. Clipping on May 10 to 5, 3, and 1.5 inches yielded 14.0, 10.8, and 7.3 bushels per acre. Clipping on May 15 to 5, 3, and 1.5 inches yielded 8.1, 5.7, and 3.3 bushels per acre. The reductions in grain yield were accompanied by a thinning of stand, reduction in mature height and straw weight, and delay in maturity. 31. The function of the wheat leaves, after heading, in adding to the grain yield was determined during 4 years, 1920-1923, by remov - ing the leaves at 3 different dates. Removing the leaf blades 3, 10, and 17 days after heading in Turkey Red wheat which had a normal fruit - ing period of 28 days gave yields of 28.6, 32.4, and 35.4 bushels per acre, respectively, compared with 36.9 bushels for unstripped wheat. 32. Beginning with 4 days after fertilization, the following per - centages of the mature moisture-free grain of wheat had been acquired </seg>
            <seg id="p012">Nebr. Agr. Exp. Station, Research Bulletin 31 12 S successive 2-day intervals as an average for the 4 years 1920-1923; 9, 8.9, 15.2, 21.3, 33.0, 46.1, 59.6, 70.4, 81.5, 87.8, 95.8, 100.0, 100.4, and 100. During each of the 4 years, the maximum moisture-free kernel weight was acquired 2 to 4 days before dead ripe. In the curing process, approximately 0.5 per cent of substance appears to be lost. Maximum moisture-free substance had been acquired when the grain contained an average of 30 per cent water. The mature grain, 30 days after coming in full head, contained 17.3 per cent moisture. Chemical analysis of the wheat grain harvested in 2-day intervals showed a rather continued lowering in the percentage of ash, ether extract, and crude fiber thruout the kernel development. The per - centage of protein reduced quite regularly until 4 or 6 days before maturity, when it gradually increased 1 to 2 per cent by maturity. The percentage of nitrogen-free extract increased until 6 or 8 days before maturity after which it decreased approximately 1 per cent by maturity. 33. Turkey Red wheat harvested under field conditions at 3 stages of maturity gave the following results as an average for 5 years 1919-1923: early dough, 7 days before ripe, 23.7 bushels; late dough. 3 days before ripe, 28.8 bushels; and ripe, 30.9 bushels per acre. The 2 earlier stages yielded 77 and 93 per cent as much grain as when fully ripe. In a second experiment extending over 4 years, 1920-1923, wheat harvested in the milk, early dough, medium dough, stiff dough, and mature stages yielded respectively 21.5, 26.2, 31.6, 33.5, and 34.6 bushels per acre. The average relative kernel weights for these respective harvests were 59, 75, 88, 97, and 100 per cent, while the corresponding relative grain yields per acre were 64, 76, 92, 97, and 100 per cent. 34. During the 21 years 1903-1923, it has taken Turkey Red winter wheat an average of 31 days to ripen after coming in full head. The extreme variations in length of fruiting period for different sea - sons has been 24 days in 1911 and 39 days in 1903 and 1904. No close correlation exists between the grain yield and the length of the fruit - ing period. 35. It has been concluded from the comparative behavior of different strains and varieties of winter wheat and from general field obser - vations that winterkilling in Nebraska is usually due either to extreme cold beyond the endurance of the plant, or to drying out as a result of moisture shortage. Winterkilling due to smothering from sleet or ice covering and to rupture of the roots by heaving is of more seldom occurrence. </seg>
            <seg id="p013">Winter Wheat Investigations 13 Kanred and Nebraska No. 60 have both proved somewhat hardier than common Turkey Red. Nebraska No. 6 and several other pro - ductive selections and varieties from this and other stations are fully equal and may be somewhat superior to common Turkey Red in this regard. The productivity of other more hardy wheats either is defi - nitely inferior or has not yet been fully established. As a class the soft and semihard varieties are less winter-hardy than the hard winter wheat varieties. A limited opportunity to observe this quality in Blackhull wheat suggests that it is definitely less winter-resistant than Turkey Red. 36. The rusting of winter wheat varies greatly in different seasons. The conditions most favorable to rust development are high tem - perature and high humidity accompanied by dew or rain followed by sunshine. Lodged grain by virtue of reduced air circulation, which results in higher humidity, is commonly subject to more severe rust - infection than standing grain. Orange leaf rust is more common than black stem rust but does less injury. Only 2 varieties of winter wheat grown in the Nebraska experiments have proved materially less subject to rust than common Turkey Red. Kanred has proved outstandingly resistant to the rust forms prevailing in Nebraska wheat fields every year since its introduction in 1915, except in 1923. In 1920, when a severe black stem rust epidemic occurred at the Experiment Station, Kanred rusted 19 per cent against 49 per cent for common Turkey Red. Nebraska No. 28 that year rusted only 18 per cent as a result of escaping rust by virtue of its earliness. This variety is fully as susceptible as Turkey Red. Every other variety that year rusted at least twice as badly as Kanred. Reduction in yield due to rusting depends upon the stage of maturity of the crop when attacked and upon the amount of rust. 37. Stinking smut or bunt of wheat may be successfully controlled in Nebraska by use of the standard formalin and copper carbonate treat - ments. This smut has assumed such large proportions in recent years that care should be given to its prevention wherever it has occurred. In 1924, six samples of Kanred differing in smut infection were obtained locally and compared for yield in field plats. Samples pro - ducing 0, 3, 8, 12, 42, and 63 per cent smutted heads in the field yielded respectively 34.7, 31.8, 28.2, 26.5, 20.7, and 16.3 bushels per acre, with corresponding grain test weights of 60.5, 59.5, 59.0, 58.0, 55.0, and 50.0 pounds per bushel. In a smut-treatment test, infected seed that produced 38 per cent smutted heads and gave 27.5 bushels per acre without treatment yielded 33.1 and 34.0 bushels when treated with the standard formalin and the copper carbonate methods, respectively. Seed which produced 63 per cent smutted heads yielded 20.6 bushels without treatment and 34.7 and 34.3 </seg>
            <seg id="p014">14 Nebe. Age. Exp. Station, Research Bulletin 31 bushels, respectively, when given the formalin and copper carbonate treatments. Practically smut-free seed yielded 35.1, 36.0, and 36.0 bushels per acre, respectively, when untreated, formalin treated, and copper carbonate treated. 38. A histological leaf study of wheat, acclimated to various sources, gave no consistent evidence of the inheritance of histological modifi - cations induced by the environment. As an example, reduction in the length of stomata and stomatal apertures under adverse moisture conditions might be interpreted as an adaptive modification were it not accompanied by a decided increase in number of stomata per unit of leaf area. It appears that wheat reacts to relatively unfavorable con - ditions by assuming a more dwarfish vegetative character. The indi - vidual cells, which are the units of growth, are reduced in size. This explains the reduction in size of stomata and epidermal cells and also their greater number in a given area. These differences do not appear to have been transmitted to progeny plants when grown comparably under uniform conditions. 39. Three standard varieties of rye have been compared for yield with Nebraska No. 60 winter wheat during a period of 5 years, 1919 - 1923. The wheat has averaged 1650 pounds or 27.9 bushels per acre compared with 1602 pounds or 27.5 bushels per acre for the 3 varieties of rye. Rosen rye, Advance rye, and Common rye have averaged 28.8, 28.4, and 26.4 bushels per acre, respectively. 40. During the 15-year period 1909-1923, the comparative yields of winter wheat and other crops grown at the Nebraska Experiment Station have averaged: Turkey Red winter wheat 33 bushels, spring wheat 18 bushels, Kherson oats 51 bushels, Hogue Yellow Dent corn 46 bushels, and Habaro soy beans 17 bushels per acre. 41. A comparison of field and nursery results indicates that when nursery methods correspond closely with those of field plats the nursery may be expected to give fair indications of relative behavior in the field. Outstandingly good or poor varieties and strains have in a large measure been established in both the nursery and the field experiments. Insufficient replication, plat competition, and short dur - ation of the tests are regarded as outstanding causes of inaccuracy in comparative results. Less accurate methods are permissible for pre - liminary testing and elimination of the less promising sorts than where accurate comparative yields are sought. </seg>
            <seg id="p015">WINTER WHEAT INVESTIGATIONS T. A. KIESSELBACH Twenty years of wheat breeding, consisting chiefly of the isolation and testing of pure lines, has now been conducted at the Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station. It is the purpose of this paper to report the conduct and results of this work. The resulting strains are compared with the best other wheats available from Nebraska and other sources. The effects of a number of cultural practices related to the preparation of seed, seeding, treatment of the growing crop, and harvesting are also presented. Some consideration is given to the experimental technique of the comparative tests. The testing of winter wheat varieties at this Station was begun in 1890 by C. L. Ingersoll and was continued by him until 1896, when he was succeeded by T. L. Lyon. The superiority in Nebraska of hard winter wheat, and especially of the Turkey Red, was determined under the direction of T. L. Lyon, 1896 to 1906. These investigations were con - tinued by E. G. Montgomery, 1907 to 1911, and have since been in charge of the writer. IMPORTANCE OF THE WHEAT CROP Winter wheat ranks second (Table 1) in importance among the cultivated field crops of Nebraska. The average annual acreage of all wheat in this state during the last 5 years has been approximately 3,580,000 acres, with a total annual pro - duction of 56 million bushels. Of this crop, 3,331,000 acres were winter wheat and 249,000 acres were spring wheat. INTRODUCTION OF WINTER WHEAT IN NEBRASKA Altho wheat of the winter type was grown in more east - ern states long before Nebraska was being settled, spring wheat was grown almost exclusively in this state prior to Acknowledgment is made for efficient assistance at various times during the coarse of these experiments to Messrs. Arthur Anderson, W. EL Lyness, J. A. Rateliff, and Carl E. Rosenquist. The milling and baking results, as specified, have been supplied by the offices of Hilling Investigations and Cereal Investigations, of the U. S. Department of Agriculture, and by the Nebraska station chemist. The chemical analyses have been made under the direction of either F. W. Upson or H. J. Blish, station chemists. </seg>
            <seg id="p016">Nebr. Agr. Exp. Station, Research Bulletin 31 1890. According to C. L. Ingersoll and C. E. Bessey x (1894) , this was due to a lack of winter resistant varieties that could be relied upon to survive the winters in this section. The risk in growing winter wheat in Nebraska was greatly re - duced with the introduction of the Turkey Red variety. Carleton 2 (1914) and Bassett 3 (1913) credit the Mennonite emigrants with having brought the first seed of this variety to the United States from their native home in southern Russia. There is no authentic record of the first growing of Turkey Red wheat in Nebraska. Mennonite emigrants, bringing seed with them, camped at Lincoln, Nebraska, in 1873. Some of these emigrants settled on farms in south - eastern Nebraska, tho the majority moved into Kansas. The climatic and soil conditions of Crimea, Russia, are so similar to those of Kansas and southern Nebraska that Turkey Red wheat proved well suited to this region. Various later im - portations of this type of wheat by the U. S. Department of Agriculture and private citizens have been assigned variety names corresponding with the Russian locality from which they were secured, such as Crimean, Kharkof, Malakof, and Yaroslav. Extensive production of Turkey Red wheat was delayed for some years. American millers discouraged it by paying a premium for the soft wheats, because their mills were not equipped to grind wheat of the hard winter type. With the adoption of suitable milling machinery following 1890, the excellent bread mak - ing qualities of Turkey Red wheat became apparent and the market discriminations were removed. It appears that the growing of this variety gradually spread northward in Kansas to southeastern Nebraska, where only the most pro - gressive farmers grew it in a limited way in the late eighties. According to Ingersoll and Bessey ' ( 1894 ) , and Lyon * (1902), variety tests at the Experiment Station and exten - sive co-operative tests with farmers did much to aid in the northward and westward movement of winter wheat culture. One hundred and eighteen varieties of this crop had been tested by the Experiment Station prior to 1902. Turkey Red proved to be the most desirable from the standpoint of yield, quality, and hardiness. Only 2 other varieties, Big Frame and Currell, withstood the winters satisfactorily in the tests. Being soft wheats, they were considered inferior in milling 1 Intrersoll, C. L., and Bessey, C. E. Wheat and Some of Its Problems. Nebr. Agr. Exp. Sta. Bui. 32. 1894. 'Carleton. M. A.

The early re - sults with these 3 varieties for 5 years are given in Table 2. Further testing during the 5 succeeding years, 1902-1906, reported in Table 3, substantiate earlier conclusions regard - ing the superiority of Turkey Red over other varieties avail - able at that time. ' IMPROVEMENT OF TURKEY RED WHEAT After the superiority of Turkey Red wheat for Nebraska conditions was recognized, the Agricultural Experiment Sta - tion undertook its further improvement. The various methods employed were (1) isolation of pure strains, accompanied for several years by continuous selection of the most pro - ductive plants within a strain, (2) isolation of pure strains and testing for production without further selection, (3) hybridization and testing of segregates, (4) competition breeding, and (5) continuous fanning mill selection. The first 3 of these practices are classed in this bulletin as " wheat breeding." Whether continuous selection, discontinuous selection, or hybridization is followed, selection of individuals and testing their progeny is the fundamental basis of procedure. It be - ing impossible to tell by the appearance of the individual what the relative production of the progeny will be, the prac - tical outcome of the work will depend upon the reliability of the testing. A statement of the methods employed is, there - fore, of interest. It is natural that in the evolution of experi - mental procedure its technique should be improved and that results should become more dependable. MODES OF NURSERY TESTING All wheat breeding involves the use of small nursery plats because of limited seed supply, and because of the large num - bers of selections to be compared.

Centgeners. — When wheat breeding was initiated at this experiment station in the fall of 1902, the centgener method of testing employed by Hays of Minnesota was adopted. This Cethod, illustrated in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, was well suited the purpose for which it was intended, namely, to equally space the seed to permit observation, and selection of the 'First S yean' data taken from Nebr.

This method was employed for planting the nursery during the period 1902 to 1907. Fig. 2. — A view of the centgener nursery as grown during the period 1902 to 1907. Each centgener was planted to 100 seeds spaced 6 inches apart in each direction. </seg>
            <seg id="p020">20 Nebr. Agr. Exp. Station, Research Bulletin 31 was normally planted to 100 seeds spaced 6 inches apart each way. The seeds were dropped individually, by hand, into the cup at the upper end of each of the 10 spouts of the centgener drill. The operation of one lever plunged all seeds into the soil and the working of another lever moved the machine six inches forward by means of hooks grabbing in holes spaced equidistant in the planks on which it rode. This manner of nursery testing was used exclusively from 1902 to 1907, inclusive. The centgener method is now considered obsolete as a test plat because superior performance of a strain when space planted at only about one-tenth the normal field rate cannot be a criterion of superiority when grown under ordinary field conditions at a much thicker rate of seeding. Further - more, the theory of accumulative improvement thru con - tinuous selection of the best developed plants, within a pure strain, appears to be based on a misunderstanding of the genetics of self-fertilized plants, such as wheat. This would seem to eliminate the need for space planting the seed. The principle of centgener planting (space planting) is now em - ployed only in special cases, such as the preliminary space planting of seeds in order to secure " mother " plants rather than mere heads, with which to begin a selection nursery. In the case of hybrid progenies, segregation may also be best determined when the plants are spaced. Nursery Rows. — The row method of comparing strains of wheat in the nursery was adopted in 1909 and entirely re - placed the centgener. A special drill, illustrated in modified form in Fig. 3, was designed, which distributes the seed in the row in a manner corresponding with farm practice (Fig. 4). The feeds of the drill spouts are all independently adjustable and may be set to seed any desired rate. Except where strains differ very decidedly in kernel size, approx - imately equal volumes of seed are sown with all feeds set alike. In the case of extreme differences in seed size, drill adjustments are made. Data from single-row plats were found subject to an un - avoidable source of error of sufficient magnitude in many cases to vitiate results. This is competition between unlike sorts in adjacent rows, for the various elements of growth, such as moisture, soil nutrients, and light. Such competition is especially apparent in the case of adjacent rows differing in the amount of vegetation, whether due to heritable rank - ness of growth, stooling, winterkilling, or seeding rate.

Fig. 5. — A rod row nursery planted with the nursery drill. When unlike sorts are seeded in adjacent rows, the element of plat com - petition may interfere with the making of a reliable comparison. Such plat competition may arise from differences in vegetative size, stooling, winterkilling, earliness, and number of seeds planted. Grouping of similar sorts will aid to some extent in reducing such unequal competition. </seg>
            <seg id="p023">Winter Wheat Investigations 23 The Nursery Block. — A 5-row nursery block has been used for all comparative strain and variety tests in the nursery since 1914. The block test combines the good features of the single-row method with the added advantages of overcoming plat competition and providing a more reliable opportunity for comparing vegetative differences such as lodging, un - modified by the adjacent strain. Border rows of these blocks are discarded at harvest, in order to eliminate the effects of border competition. Four-foot alleyways between plat ends are cropped to wheat in order to preserve greater soil uniformity for succeeding crops. A 6-inch strip is hoed out Fig. 6. — The nursery block method of nursery testing. Border com - petition may be largely avoided by discarding the outside rows at harvest. The mass effect of multiple row plats facilitates reliable comparison of varietal differences. along both ends of the plat to indicate the plat confines. Except in the case of very marked difference in seed size, the drill is set to seed approximately the same volume for the various strains. Altho only approximately equal volumes rather than identical numbers of seeds are sown for the various strains in this manner, it has been evident from the rate of planting tests such as those reported in Table 46 that there may be considerable variation in planting rate without materially affecting the yield per acre. This holds true of nursery blocks but not of nursery rows, which are so subject to adjacent plat competition. </seg>
            <seg id="p024">24 Nebr. Agr. Exp. Station, Research Bulletin 31 Replication of Nursery Plats. — Soil heterogeneity as well as other causes of accidental errors in comparative crop tests has been well recognized in more recent years. Obser - vations bearing on this point at the Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station have been recorded in Nebraska Re - search Bulletin No. 13 and B. P. I. Bulletin 269 of the U. S. Department of Agriculture. Systematic replication and the use of long, narrow plats has been shown very effective in the reduction of errors. The centgener tests of strains made during the period of 1903 to 1908 were not systematically replicated. From 5 to 40 centgeners were planted consecutively for each strain, each centgener representing a different selection within the strain. This system facilitated carrying out the plan of con - tinuous selection within a strain. With the adoption of the row and block method in the nursery, systematic replication has been practiced to the ex - tent of growing 10 plats of each strain annually, during 1910 to 1923. Yields have been determined by averaging all dupli - cates. The number of replications indicated in these experi - ments is inclusive of the total number of like plats under consideration. Check Plats. — With the use of the nursery row and block methods of testing, every fifth or sixth plat has been seeded to original Turkey Red wheat to serve as a basis for com - parison of superiority. The supply of check Turkey Red seed has been maintained annually in field plats without special treatment or selection. Harvesting and Threshing. — The centgeners were for - merly harvested by pulling the plants where individual plant performance was to be observed. They were cut with hand sickles, whenever bulk harvests were made. The single-row plats have all been harvested with hand sickles and bound into bundles with twine. In the case of 5 row blocks, the 3 middle rows are harvested together with a corrugated grain sickle and tied together with the labeled stake, into bundles with two twine bands. After the nursery bundles have been placed in shocks, these are covered with burlap shock covers to avoid possible dam - age by birds. When sufficiently dry, the grain sheaves are stored in the threshing shed, where a small motor-driven nursery thresher, illustrated in Fig. 9, is located. The bundle and grain weights are determined for each plat in grams, and the duplicate plats are averaged for compar - ative yields. </seg>

CONDUCT OF FIELD PLAT TESTS Field plat yields have been determined during the last 20 years in plats 16 rods long and varying in width to make an area of 1/15 or 1/30 acre. Since 1910, the plats have all been one drill wide and have commonly included 1/30 acre. Prior to 1910, a 2-foot space was left vacant between plats and since that time only one drill row or 8 inches has been left between plats. Border effects have been decidedly re - duced by the narrow bare strip. Systematic duplication of field plats began in 1910, when 2 plats were seeded to each strain. In earlier years, only 1 field plat was usually sown to each sort, altho some of the strains were represented by a number of selections within </seg>
            <seg id="p027">Winter Wheat Investigations 27 the strain, which were seeded in adjacent plats. During the period of 1911 to 1923 inclusive, varieties and selections have been represented by 3 to 5 systematically distributed plats annually. Systematically distributed check plats sown to the original Turkey wheat were introduced by Montgomery for the first time in 1907. This same original Turkey Red wheat has been used ever since for checks in both strain and variety tests, inserting a check ordinarily after every fifth test plat. The plats have been harvested with a horse-drawn grain binder, which has had a binder engine attached since 1909. Down swaths with the binder are made on discard plats which are inserted at intervals for this purpose. All duplicate plats of any one sort are threshed consecutively, and seed is saved from the last plat threshed. The replication of plats has usually been relied upon to reduce the effects of soil variations, and yields have seldom been corrected by check plats. ISOLATION AND CONTINUOUS SELECTION WITHIN PURE LINES The improvement of wheat by continuous selection of the most productive plants within a strain was begun in this state by T. L. Lyon in 1902. Eight hundred heads of Turkey winter wheat were selected from the 1902 crop and planted individually in centgeners that fall. In 1904 they were re - duced in number to 120, to 68 in 1905, and to 47 in 1906. High yield and high protein content formed the basis for selection. During the 4-year period 1903 to 1906, from 5 to 40 high-yielding plants were selected from each strain and grown in separate centgeners the following year. By con - tinuous selection of the highest-yielding individual plants from the most productive plant progenies of each strain, opportunity was thought to be afforded for an accumulative improvement. Twenty-six of these strains were compared for yield in field plats with the original Turkey Red during the 4-year period 1907-1910. The results of this 4-year test were pub - lished in 1912 by E. G. Montgomery, who had charge of the work during this period. These data are reproduced in Table 4. Montgomery concluded from the average of these 4 years in field plats that " the percentage of nitrogen varied from 2.45 to 2.75 and the yield per acre from 28.8 to 40.7 bushels — a difference of about 12 bushels." Three of the five strains </seg>
            <seg id="p028">28 Nebr. Agr. Exp. Station, Research Bulletin 31 which were the highest yielders in this 4-year test were dis - tributed to Nebraska farmers in the fall of 1910 for com - parison with their own wheat. Reports were received in the fall of 1911 from 21 farmers, who grew 8 acres of the new wheat as part of a larger field seeded to their local variety. The results of this test were summarized by Montgomery as shown in Table 5. The yields of the new strains surpassed the locally grown Turkey wheat 4 bushels per acre according to the farmers' reports. Such striking differences were obtained in these station and co-operative tests that it seemed desirable to verify them by further testing. The 5 highest and 5 lowest-yielding strains of the 4-year test in field plats (1907-1910) were compared for yield with the original Turkey Red wheat during the 4-year period of 1911 to 1914 in systematically replicated field plats. A similar test was made in nursery blocks during the 9 years 1914 to 1922. Field-plat data comparing the best 5 of these strains with the original Turkey Red are available for the 8-year period 1911 to 1918. (Tables 6 and 7.) Fig. 10. — Field plats used in these wheat investigations have com - monly been 16 rods in length and one-thirtieth acre in area.

The procedure in this nursery differed from that used in the 1902 selections in that continuous selection was not practiced. One thousand heads were selected from the 1907 crop. Twenty kernels from each head were grown in rows 18 inches long and 8 inches apart, and were harvested for yield in 1908. The number of strains continued in 1909 was reduced to 220 on the basis of yield and character of grow - ing crop. Two 16-foot rows were grown from each strain at the normal rate of seeding in that year, and grain yields Winter Whi 1AT 1NVESTK IATIONS 31 Pable 5. — Result of test wht grown in comparison with o, re selected \ &lt;-dinary Turl 'urkey Red w, ey Red wheat heat was in 1911 Wheat No. Yield of local Turkey Red Yield of Improved Turkey Red Name Town County Bushels Bushels Carl Rohde H.

Eighty strains were continued in 1910, 1911, and 1912 in 16-foot rows, replicated 10 times and seeded at the rate of 5 pecks per acre. Seventy of these strains were selected for apparent superiority. Every fifth plat was seeded as a check to the original Turkey Red. During the 5-year period 1914-1918, all 80 strains were grown in 5-row nursery blocks, replicated 10 times. Every sixth plat was a check. The number of strains was reduced after the 1918 crop to 31, which were continued until 1922. Of these 31 strains, 23 were selected because of their high yield, and 8 because of the low yield, which they had given during the 5-year test 1914-1918. All of these nursery results are re - ported in Tables 9 and 10. The annual yields for the 80 strains during the entire period from 1908 to 1918 are re - ported in Table 9. This provides opportunity to observe the variation in relative performance in different seasons over a rather long period of years. The annual yields are summar - ized so as to show the average yield in bushels, the relative yields in per cent, and the relative rank for (1) the 5-year averages in nursery blocks during 1914-1918, (2) the 3-year Strain number 1 — i ■ — s 1 1914 1915 1916 1917 1918 1919 1920 1921 1922 Av.

In the 5-year nursery block test (1914 - 1918) which is the most reliable test available for the entire 80 strains, the highest-yielding individual strain, No. 60, sur - passed the original Turkey Red 17 per cent in grain yield. The 10 strains yielding highest in the 5-year test averaged 40.2 bushels per acre, compared with 34.6 bushels as an average for the 10 poorest and 35.5 bushels for the original Turkey Red. These yields represent 13 per cent superiority for the 10 best and 3 per cent reduction for the 10 poorest, compared with the check. As an average for the 9 years 1914-1922, the original Turkey Red was surpassed 3.2 bushels or 10 per cent by strain No. 60, and a like amount by the average yield for the 10 strains that yielded highest in the 5-year test during 1914 - 1918. yWI MStyi 11SW J.'S'J I -J.tSJ.KJ) LIC field and nursery plats.

            <seg id="p040">Nebe. Agr. Exp. Station, Research Bulletin 31 40 As a grand average for the 12-year nursery test (1910 - 1922), during which time 31 strains were grown 3 years in single-row plats replicated 10 times and 9 years in 5-row blocks replicated 10 times, the original Turkey Red was ex - ceeded 5.9 bushels or 17.5 per cent by the highest-yielding strain, No. 60, and more than 10 per cent by 18 of the 31 strains that were tested thruout the entire period. The amount of experimental error of these nursery tests is suggested by the compiled check plat data recorded in Table 11. Thruout these trials every fifth or sixth plat has been planted uniformly to the original Turkey Red wheat to serve as indicators of the variability in yields due to other causes than inherent differences between the strains. Correspond - ing check plats in each of the 10 duplicate series were aver - aged so as to give 10 mean yields of 10 systematically dis - tributed check plats each. Altho the range of variation be - tween check averages was rather high during individual years, the extreme range was reduced to 1.8 bushels per acre or 5 per cent as an average for the 12 years. The co - efficient of variability for the 10 check averages of 10 plats each was 1.79 per cent. The annual protein content for these 31 Turkey strains is reported on a moisture-free basis in Table 12 for the 7 years 1916-1922. The protein content of the original wheat aver - aged 14.62 per cent. The two extremes of 14.31 per cent and 15.36 per cent protein content were registered by strains No. 60 and No. 78 respectively, which in turn yielded 17.5 per cent more and 2.4 per cent less grain per acre than the check during the 12-year test, 1910-1922. The variation in protein content from year to year is very marked, ranging from 20 per cent in 1918 down to 10.8 per cent in 1921, as an aver - age for the 31 strains and original wheat. The highest pro - tein content was secured from the lowest-yielding strains and in the years of lowest yield. </seg>

            <seg id="p047">47 Winter Wheat Investigations cured from S. C. Bassett of Gibbon, Nebraska, and known by him as Red Russian, averaged 5.4 per cent higher yield, (2)Kharkof yielded 4.4 per cent more, and (3) a pure line developed by Mr. George Coupland of Elgin, Nebraska, from ordinary Turkey Red, yielded 0.9 per cent more than Turkey Red. Big Frame, which is a soft, beardless wheat, yielded 93.4 per cent as much as Turkey Red, and Nebraska No. 28, which is a small, early maturing hybrid between Turkey Red and Big Frame varieties, yielded 9.5 per cent less. The experimental error of this field-plat test is indicated by the compiled check plat yields recorded in Table 16. Fifteen or more systematically distributed Turkey Red check plats were included annually. Corresponding check plats in the various duplicate series of plats have been so averaged as to give mean check yields similar in number and distribu - tion to the wheats under test. The extreme variation in the annual check averages was rather high in some years, but was reduced to 1.4 bushels per acre or approximately 4 per cent as a 13-year average. The coefficient of variability for these check averages has been calculated for each year's results and amounted to 1.3 per cent for the 13-year averages. The annual variations in the protein content of the strains and varieties grown in this test are recorded in Table 17 for the 8 years 1916-1923. The extreme range of protein content varied from 13.62 per cent to 14.32 per cent, mois - ture-free basis, compared with 13.9 per cent for the original Turkey Red. The 2 medium hard varieties, Big Frame and Nebraska No. 28, averaged as high in protein as common Turkey Red and higher than many of the Turkey Red strains. They were also the lowest-yielding of any of these wheats. </seg>

            <seg id="p049">Winter Wheat Investigations 49 COMPARISON OF NEBRASKA VARIETIES AND STRAINS WITH BEST FROM OTHER STATES It was thought desirable in 1914 to make comparisons be - tween the best wheats which other stations were growing and our own. Forty-nine samples of hard and soft to semihard red winter wheats were assembled and planted in the fall of that year, to be compared as to yield, quality, and plant characters. With the exception of 1917, when the crop was lost by winterkilling, this comparison was continued for a period of 8 years. The annual yields for 7 years are given in Table 18, and are summarized in Table 19 together with plant characters. This test included 25 hard and 24 soft to semihard varieties. Of the former group, 22 yielded as much or more than the common Turkey Red long grown at this experiment station. Of the latter group, only 3 yielded as much or more than the common Turkey Red. The data clearly suggest that the best of the Nebraska selections (No. 60 and No. 6) surpass the original Turkey Red but are equalled by several varieties and selections from other sources. Crimean No. P-762, which was named Kanred in 1917 by the Kansas State Agricultural College, where it originated as a pure line selec - tion from Crimean C. I. No. 1435, surpassed all other vari - eties and strains in this test, giving a yield 19 per cent higher than the commercial Turkey. South Dakota No. 144, which is of the Turkey Red type, ranked second, with a yield 11.9 per cent greater than commercial Turkey. Nebraska Turkey strain No. 60 (Nebraska No. 60) ranked third, yield - ing 11.6 per cent more than common Turkey. Crimean C. I. No. 1435, which was imported by the U. S. Department of Agriculture from the Crimea in Southern Russia, produced 10.9 per cent more than common Turkey. This is the original commercial variety from which Kanred was selected as a pure line. Nebraska Turkey strain No. 6 ranked fifth in this test, giving a grain yield 10 per cent greater than the commercial Turkey, from which it and Nebraska No. 60 are selections. The variation in grain yield for the Turkey Red check plats included in this 7-year nursery variety test is shown in Table 20. Ninety consecutive check plats are here aver - aged into 9 groups of 10 systematically distributed plats. The data suggest a large experimental error for a single year's results, even tho tests are replicated as often as ten times. This variation between mean check yields of 10 plats </seg>

The strain in the foreground is Buffum No. 17 and is the only variety of all those reported in Tables 18 and 19 which survived the winter under the conditions of this test. This plat is typical of all 10 replications of Buffum No. 17. Very satisfactory fall growth had been made by all these varieties. In spite of its extreme winter hardiness Buffum No. 17 is a low yielder and unsuitable for Nebraska growing. each was reduced to an extreme of 2.7 bushels per acre as an average for the 7 years, while the coefficient of variability for the 7-year averages was 2.51 per cent. Compared with each other, none of these 5 highest-yielding varieties varied more than 2 inches in plant height and 1 day in heading and ripening dates. Kanred and South Dakota No. 144 averaged one day earlier than any of the other hard winter wheats tested. Six years' available data for protein content of these wheats from various sources in - dicate that ordinary Turkey Red was practically equalled in protein by Kanred and by South Dakota No. 144 Turkey; was surpassed about \/k per cent protein by Crimean No. C.

Station, Research Bulletin 31 while the extreme annual variation for all varieties was 9.5 per cent, viz., 21.01 per cent protein for 1918 and 11.5 per cent protein for 1921. (Table 21.) A small group of varieties reported in Table 22 has become of special interest to Nebraska farmers in recent years. This is due to the fact that it contains all of the varieties that have recently been promoted in this territory, as well as several that have gained prominence otherwise. It is quite certain that this list contains the best winter wheats now available for Nebraska conditions. Table 22. — Summary of the more prominent winter wheats (jrcwn in the Nebraska Experiment Station tests GROWING STRAINS PURE VS. IN MIXTURES Nursery Results. — During the 9-year period 1914-1922, 2 groups of 5 strains each were compared in the nursery by planting the strains separately and also in two mechanical mixtures. The strains used in this test were the 5 poorest and 5 best 1902 selections as determined in the 1907-1910 field test reported in Table 7. Table 23 reports the average yields of the 5 best strains and of the 5 poorest strains planted separately in comparison with the yields of mechan - ical mixtures of the same strains. The mixtures were made up annually from equal quantities of each strain included.

In comparison the one best individual strain entering the mixture yielded 35.2 bushels. The 5 poorest strains averaged 31.1 bushels per acre when grown pure, and 32.1 bushels when grown as a mechanical mixture. The best individual strain of this group yielded 32.5 bushels. Field Plat Results. — During the 9-year period 1915-1923, 11 of the most productive Turkey Red strains of the 1907 selections were grown in a mechanical mixture to be com - pared annually with the average for the same strains grown separately. The mixture was made up annually as in the previous test. As an average for the entire period the mix - ture yielded 33.9 bushels per acre, compared with 34.1 bushels as an average for the same 11 strains grown pure, and 35.8 bushels for the highest-yielding individual strain grown alone. (Table 24.) The results of these three 9-year comparisons indicate no advantage from mixing strains com - pared with growing them pure. On the other hand, higher yields may be expected from the best strain grown pure than from a mixture. COMPARATIVE MILLING AND BAKING TESTS OF NEBRASKA TURKEY RED STRAINS AND VARIETIES Since wheat is grown primarily for conversion into flour and bread, it is desirable that the grain produced should possess those qualities which best fit it for such use. The qualities most sought for by millers and bakers of the hard winter wheats are: (1) high percentage of flour, (2) high water requirement in the dough which reflects economy of flour in bread making, (3) large loaf volume which is an ex - pression of " strength " in the flour, (4) fine texture and light color of the bread. The original commercial hard winter wheats of the Turkey Red type have a well deserved reputation for their excellent milling and baking qualities. The Turkey Red variety grown at the Nebraska Experiment Station for thirty years may well be taken as a basis for comparison. Any improvement over it thru some breeding practice, without yield impair - ment, would be an important achievement. Likewise any improvement in yielding ability, with a satisfactory retention of milling and baking value, would have far-reaching signif - icance. It is therefore of interest to compare a number of the most productive selections from Turkey Red wheat with the </seg>
            <seg id="p061">Winter Wheat Investigations 61 original variety and with other prominent Nebraska var - ieties. Three years' results are reported in Table 25 and are summarized in Table 26. All of these strains have been tested for yield in systematically replicated field plats for 9 or more years (Table 15), and with the exception of No. 78 have been included because of their promise of high yield. Strain No. 78 is a low yielder and has been of interest only because of its unusually stiff straw. Nebraska No. 6 and No. 60 have been extensively grown thruout the state during the last eight years. The milling samples contained equal quantities from each of the replicate plats (5, 3, and 4 replicate plats in 1916, 1917, and 1918, respectively) and should therefore be fairly com - parable with each other so far as field location is concerned. These milling and baking tests have been made for the Ne - braska Experiment Station by the Office of Milling Investi - gations, Bureau of Agricultural Economics of the United States Department of Agriculture. Standard formulas and methods for making the various determinations were em - ployed. These are described by J. H. Shollenberger and J. A. Clark in Department Bulletin No. 1183 of the United States Department of Agriculture. As an average for the three years (Table 25), the great - est deviations of any of the Turkey Red strains from the original variety in protein content of the whole wheat and flour were 0.4 and 0.6 per cent of protein respectively. The ratio of protein in the flour to the protein in the whole wheat did not vary more than 4 per cent for the various strains, as an average for the three years. This suggests that the protein analysis of the whole wheat is a fairly good index of the protein content of the flour with which the baker is directly concerned. The per cent of protein in the straight flour was approximately 90 per cent as great as that of the whole grain. The cause of this difference lies in the higher protein content of the shorts and bran which are by-products in the manufacture of flour. Exclusive of strain No. 78, these 12 strains compared with the original Turkey Red averaged almost identical weights per bushel, protein content, ash content, percentage of straight flour produced, and color and quality of bread, but exceeded the original 2.5 per cent in the percentage of water used in the dough and 0.6 per cent in loaf weight. On the other hand, these strains produced loaves which averaged 7 per cent smaller volume than did the common Turkey Red. Accompanying these differences, the strains averaged 3.7 </seg>

Station, Research Bulletin 31 bushels more grain per acre during this 3-year period and 2 bushels more during a 9-year period (1915-1923) than did the common Turkey Red. Commercial hard winter varieties grown in these tests under the names of Turkey, Kharkov, and Red Russian are all different importations of hard red winter wheat from Russia. The two latter varieties averaged very similar to the Turkey Red in all milling and baking qualities, except in loaf volume and in this regard they were 9 and 10 per cent inferior, respectively. In view of the fact that the soft red winter wheats are generally regarded as inferior in baking strength to the hard winter wheats, it is worthy of notice that the Marvelous variety, which is of this type, should exceed the highest of all the hard wheats by 6 per cent (Table 26) in loaf volume and excel all in protein content. Since the 3 lowest-yielding wheats (Table 26), Turkey Red, Nebraska No. 78, and Marvelous, averaged only 27.9 bushels per acre in this 3-year period, compared with 35.8 bushels for all the other varieties and strains, and at the same time produced an average loaf volume of 2170 c. c, com - pared with an average loaf volume of 2003 c. c, it appears that high yield and qualities associated with high volume may be antagonistic qualities under ordinary soil conditions represented in these experiments. These soil conditions con - sist in part of a supply of nitrates so limited during the grow - ing season that ordinarily not more than a trace of available nitrates may be recovered from the soil by chemical analysis when the wheat reaches maturity. A limited amount of available nitrogen which would be fully utilized by either a large or a small grain yield may result in a stronger flour of higher protein and gluten in the case of the lower yielding wheat. This is further sug - gested by the progressive inverse correlation between grain yield and per cent protein in the crops harvested from wheat planted at successive planting dates (Tables 44 and 45). This adverse effect of delay in seeding upon the grain yield is equivalent to an increase in the inadaptation of the wheat to its environment. Relative inadaptation of wheat to the crop growing conditions may result in lower yield accompanied by relatively high protein content. The effects of seasonal variations upon milling and baking quality are summarized in the end of Table 25. As an average for the 19 varieties and strains, the yield of grain per acre was unusually low and the protein content very </seg>
            <seg id="p069">69 Winter Wheat Investigations high for the year 1918. Altho the per cent of protein was approximately 3 per cent higher in 1918 than for 1916 and 1917, the loaf volume averaged 7 per cent lower. This would not indicate that baking strength and loaf volume are necessarily in close correlation with the per cent of protein in the wheat. The ratio of per cent protein in the flour to that of the whole wheat was rather constant in the different years for all of the strains, regardless of the actual per - centage present. As an average of the 19 different wheats tested, the percentage of protein for 1916, 1917, and 1918 were 11.2, 10.8, and 14.3, respectively, while the correspond - ing loaf volumes were 2080, 2053, and 1955, and the per - centages of water used in the dough were 60.3, 61.5, and 63.5 per cent. The milling and baking tests are reported annually during 6 years in Table 27 for the original commercial Turkey Red and the two strains Nebraska No. 6 and No. 60, which have been extensively distributed thruout the state. These samples were all composited from replicated Experiment Station field plats. The increased yield per acre of the selected strains would seem to more than offset their consistently lower loaf volume. A volume of 2,000 is considered satisfactory by the trade when these baking methods are employed. The Ex - periment Station has never heard of complaint by farmers or millers regarding the relative quality of grain produced by these strains. The Kharkov variety, recognized for its high milling and baking qualities, was not superior to these strains. Three years' results are given in Table 28, comparing Kanred with Nebraska No. 6, Nebraska No. 60, ordinary Turkey Red, and Kharkov winter wheat and Marquis spring wheat. Turkey Red surpassed the other winter wheats in protein and loaf volume, but the slight superiority in these regards was far more than offset from the grower's point of view by the increased yields of Kanred, Nebraska No. 6, and Nebraska No. 60. Kanred was inferior to Nebraska No. 6 to the extent of 0.2 per cent protein, 4.0 per cent water used in the dough, 2 per cent in loaf volume, 2 per cent in weight of loaf, and 2 per cent in color of bread. Kanred surpassed Nebraska No. 6, yielding 2.1 per cent more flour. Kanred and Nebraska No. 60 were practically equal in milling and bak - ing qualities. Since Kanred, Nebraska No. 6, and Nebraska No. 60 have been extensively adopted on Nebraska farms during the last 6 years in substitution for common Turkey Red, a complete </seg>

            <seg id="p075">Winter Wheat Investigations 75 RELATION OF WHEAT TYPE AND CULTURAL PRACTICE TO THE MILLING AND BAKING VALUE OF WHEAT* MILLING AND BAKING TESTS OF HARD AND SOFT RED WINTER WHEAT VARIETIES GROWN COMPARABLY AT THE NEBRASKA EXPERIMENT STATION Milling and baking tests were made for 11 representative varieties of hard and for 10 representative varieties of soft red winter wheat grown comparably on the Experiment Station farm during 1921, 1922, and 1923. The milling samples were each made up from 8 of the replicate nursery blocks grown in the nursery variety test, previously reported on pages 49-58. Such a test should indicate the inherent differences between the two groups, free from the effects of local and regional soil and climatic variations. The annual results are given in Table 30 and are summarized in Table 31. While there was considerable variation between varieties, the 3-year average results for the hard and soft groups, respectively, show only a slight difference in their milling and baking properties. The hard group averaged 6.5 bushels greater yield, 2.5 lbs. heavier test weight, 0.1 per cent lower protein analysis, 2.8 per cent higher flour production, 2.6 per cent higher water absorption, 7 c. c. greater loaf volume, 6 grams greater loaf weight, 2 per cent better bread texture, and identical bread color. From these results it appears that when the hard and the soft red winter wheats are grown comparably, under iden - tical soil and climatic conditions, the inferiority of the soft group in milling and baking quality is not very striking, and nearly equal milling and baking values may be expected. Inferior yields rather than decidedly inferior milling and baking values caused the soft red wheats to be decidedly less desirable than the hard red wheats under these uniform con - ditions. The individual variety variations shown in the table are of considerable interest and suggest a distinct advantage for some varieties. Turkey Red. known as South Dakota No. 144, ranked highest in these milling and baking tests and second in grain yield. No close correlation between total protein content and baking value is indicated. * These milling and baking tests were made for the Agronomy department under the direction of Dr. M. J. Blish, Station Chemist. The results are comparable with each other, but not with those previously published herein because of slightly different milling technique and baking formulas. </seg>

            <seg id="p084">84 Nebr. Agr. Exp. Station, Research Bulletin 31 RELATION OF CULTURAL PRACTICES TO THE MILLING AND BAKING VALUES OF WINTER WHEAT Milling and baking tests have been made for periods of 2 to 4 years for hard red winter wheat, to determine the effects of (1) time of planting, (2) time of harvesting, (3) time of seed bed preparation (plowing), and (4) soil fertilization with barnyard manure. EFFECT OF THE TIME OF PLANTING A comparative milling and baking test was made during the three years 1921-1923, of both the Nebraska No. 60 and the Kanred winter wheat produced in the date of planting tests reported in Tables 43 to 45. The annual and average results for both varieties are given for 8 different planting dates in Table 32. These are summarized in Table 33. Comparing the baking value of wheat from the two extreme planting dates, September 16 and February 13, the latter crop (yielding an average of 16.6 bushels less wheat per acre, testing 3.9 pounds less per bushel, and analyzing 3.7 per cent higher protein content) produced flour with 6 per cent higher water absorption, and loaves with 1 per cent greater loaf volume and 2 per cent greater weight. The tex - ture and color of all lots were nearly equal, irrespective of the protein content. Thruout the series of 8 planting dates, as seen in the tables, the correlation of baking value with protein content is not very pronounced. So slight an effect upon baking value, accompanied by such marked yield reduction when planting is materially delayed, would render unjustifiable any effort to control baking value of wheat thru the planting date. EFFECT OF TIME OF HARVESTING The milling and baking results are given in Table 34 for Turkey Red winter wheat harvested (1) ripe, (2) in the late dough stage 4 days before ripe, and (3) in the early dough stage 8 days before ripe. Premature harvesting, which resulted in average reduc - tions of 2.3 and 7.7 bushels per acre for the late dough and early dough stages respectively, failed to increase the protein content or to give superior milling and baking tests. These data do not confirm the opinion that wheat cut slightly green is superior in milling and baking qualities. </seg>

            <seg id="p090">90 Nebb. Agr. Exp. Station, Research Bulletin 31 EFFECT OF TIME OF SEED BED PREPARATION UPON THE MILLING AND BAKING VALUE In a 2-year test, 1922 and 1923, to determine the effect of time of seed bed preparation upon the milling and baking value of Turkey Red winter wheat, a fairly consistent show - ing was made in favor of early preparation (Table 35). Compared with early (July) plowing, the grain crop from late plowing (September) yielded 10.2 bushels less grain per acre, analyzed 0.6 per cent lower protein, and gave 145 c. c. smaller loaf volume. These baking results may doubt - less be associated in part at least with the effect of time of seed bed preparation upon the available soil nitrates. EFFECT OF MANURING SOIL UPON THE MILLING AND BAKING QUALITIES Milling and baking tests were made during the 3 years 1921-1923 to determine the effects of manure upon the mill - ing and baking qualities of Turkey Red wheat. Each year the grain from 7 plats manured at the rate of 8 tons every 4 years and from 5 untreated plats were mixed together and each sample milled in composite. Tho the manure (Table 36) increased the grain yield 4.6 bushels per acre, and the protein content 0.6 per cent, none of the milling and baking values were very materially influenced. It may be concluded that under these soil conditions the use of manure was valuable for increasing yields but did not appreciably increase the baking strength of the flour. PRODUCING NEW WHEATS THRU HYBRIDIZATION Altho considerable effort is now being made to recombine the more desirable qualities of two or more different var - ieties, only one outstanding distinctive new variety has been established at the Nebraska Experiment Station by such means. This is known as Nebraska No. 28. The original hybrid was made in 1903 by crossing a bearded wheat, Turkey Red, on a beardless wheat, Big Frame. A large number of types resulted from this combination and the more promising were tested for several years in field plats. The purpose of the cross was to produce a beardless hard winter wheat equal to Turkey Red in quality of grain and in yield. This result was not achieved, and all selections were dropped except a small, early, bearded type which ripens an average of 6 days earlier than either parent and is 6 inches shorter. As an average for 12 years in field plats (Table 15), Nebraska No. 28 yielded 86.2 per cent as much as its Turkey Red parent and 98 per cent as much as its Big Frame par- </seg>

            <seg id="p093">93 Winter Wheat Investigations ent. It has a softer grain and is less winter hardy than Turkey Red. A number of farmers in central and western Nebraska have been attracted by its earliness as a desirable factor in drought and hail evasion and have grown it with satisfaction for some years. Because of its short straw and relative lodge resistance it has also been grown some on low bottom land and otherwise very fertile soil where wheat tends to grow too rank. Because of its lack of winter hardiness this wheat is not recommended by the Experiment Station. An effort is being made to util - ize its earliness and lodge resistance by hybridization with other varieties. Two hundred head selections were made from this Nebraska No. 28 in 1920 and have been tested for yield, winter hardiness, and quality during the 4 succeeding years. No material differences have been observed for the various selections in these tests. The progeny of many of them are entirely true to type, and segregation of characters seems to have ceased. A beardless strain as early as the original Nebraska No. 28 has been isolated. A PROGRAM FOR FURTHER BREEDING AND SELECTION A new selection nursery was begun in 1920 with Crimean C. I. No. 1435 which proved to be the second highest yielding commercial variety of hard winter wheat in the 7-year test during 1915-1922. Five hundred and seventy strains of this variety were continued in 2 separate nurseries in 1924. One of these nurseries was planted for a comparison as to yield and other qualities under natural conditions. The strains in the other nursery were all seed inoculated with stinking smut and were also subjected during the growing season to an artificial epidemic of black stem rust. The rust inoculum was a mixture of 10 rust forms which have been found in Nebraska and was supplied by M. M. Levine of the Minnesota Experiment Station. Field infection was produced by the combined methods of (1) placing greenhouse-grown infected potted plants of Little Club spring wheat at 20-foot inter - vals thruout the nursery at 3 successive dates prior to head - ing, and (2) spraying several times with a water suspension of spores taken from the greenhouse plants. Severe rust and smut epidemics developed, and elimination of strains can now proceed with greater certainty on the combined basis of yield, quality, and relative resistance to rust, smut, winterkilling and lodging. Practically no rust or smut occurred in the </seg>

Further testing will be re - quired to verify the significance of these indications.

No variety is now known which has all of the most desir - able qualities recognized to exist in wheat. A logical effort of hybridization is to combine the outstandingly good qualities of various varieties. Buffum No. 17, Odessa, and Minturki are outstanding in winter hardiness but are inferior in yield under our conditions. Ridit, Red Hussar, Sherman, and Oregon No. 1571 C have proved highly resistant to stinking smut, having practically no smut whatever compared with 65 and 66 per cent smut for Kanred and Nebraska No. 60 in our smut inoculated nursery. Their comparative adapt - ation and yield have not yet been established for this territory. Nebraska No. 28 would be of interest as a special purpose wheat because of its extreme earliness and short straw, but it is deficient in winter hardiness. Kanred has proved de- </seg>

Nebraska No. 60 is a productive strain of winter wheat but is fairly rust susceptible. Some of the varieties of soft red winter wheat are decidedly lodge re - sistant but low in yield. All of these wheats and others are being used in hybridi - zation, with a hope of combining more of the outstanding good qualities for both general and special purpose wheats. Such crossing must be followed by individual plant selection and progeny testing for trueness to type and production. In view of the unavoidable natural crossing and mechanical mixing which occurs between strains grown for some years in comparative tests, it seems desirable to set aside some seed of each strain early in its development to serve as a source for pure seed increase in the event of farm distribution.

EFFECT OF PREVIOUS PLANTING RATE UPON SEED VALUE OF TURKEY RED WHEAT An experiment was begun in 1912 to determine the effect of thick planting upon the seed value of winter wheat. This crop is normally grown at such a thick seeding rate that in - dividual plant development is greatly reduced by competition. This may be illustrated by the stooling record of wheat sown at various planting rates (Table 46), in which the average number of stools per plant were 4.3, 2.6, and 1.8 respectively for wheat sown 3, 5, and 8 pecks per acre. Turkey Red wheat was seeded in the fall of 1911 at the respective rates of 3, 5, and 8 pecks per acre. During each of the succeeding 12 years, each lot has been continued in a seed plat at the previous planting rate, thus providing opportunity for a possible accumulative effect of excessive competition in the thick rate thru the elimination of the less vigorous strains. Beginning with 1915, a comparative </seg>

As an average for the 9-year period 1915-1923, the previous 3, 5, and 8 peck rates have yielded 34.1, 33.8, and 33.9 bushels per acre, respectively. It is evident both from yields and from plant characteristics that no heritable change has taken place as a result of continuous planting at the given rates. RELATION OF SEED GRADES TO PRODUCTION SEED VALUES OF FANNING MILL SELECTIONS Continuous selection of seed grades, by use of the fanning mill, has been practiced with a pure strain of Turkey Red wheat (Nebraska No. 6) during the last 5 years.

The largest one-fourth and the smallest one-fourth of the seed were selected by use of a regular screen fanning mill; while the heaviest one-fourth and the lightest one-fourth were secured by gravity separa - tion, thru the use of a wind blast fanning mill. The largest and the smallest one-fourth yielded, respectively, 31.7 bushels and 30.5 bushels per acre, while the heaviest and the lightest one-fourth yielded 30.7 bushels and 30.0 bushels, respectively.

These results indicate that the principal use of the fanning mill is to eliminate weed seed, trash, and diseased grain such as light, scabby, and smutty kernels. EQUAL WEIGHTS VS. EQUAL NUMBERS OF LARGE AND SMALL SEED Distinctly large and small grades of seed have been hand selected for seed from common Turkey Red wheat during each of 11 years. These 2 grades have been compared an - nually with the unselected seed by planting all in equal num - bers, and in equal weights of seeds per acre at a normal rate for the large seed. The annual planting rates and yields are recorded in Table 40 and are summarized in Table 41. As an average for the 10 years in which yields were deter - mined, the acre yields for the large, small, and unselected seed tested at equal numbers were 35.7, 32.8, and 34.5 bushels, respectively. Tested at equal weights per acre, the respec - tive yields have been 35.7, 34.3, and 36.8 bushels. While the unselected seed was at a slight disadvantage when com - pared with the large in equal numbers, this difference was entirely eliminated when equal weights of seed were planted. Small seed were at materially less disadvantage when seeded at equal weights than in equal numbers. </seg>

IMMEDIATE EFFECT OF SIZE OF SEED ON SIZE OF PLANT During the 4 years 1920-1923, 500 large and 500 small seeds of Turkey wheat have been space planted, 6 inches apart, in order to permit maximum development of the in - dividual plants.

The plants from the large seed (Table 42) averaged 5 per cent greater height, 9 per cent more stools, and 23 per cent greater yield of grain per plant. These data indicate that very small seed are less productive than large seed when given opportunity for maximum development. This may account for the some - what lower yields secured from the small and the ungraded seed, when planted in equal numbers per acre at the optimum rate for large seed. This difference tends to be overcome by planting equal weights or equal volumes of seed at an opti - mum rate for large seed (Table 41).

            <seg id="p103">Winter Wheat Investigations 103 TIME OF SEEDING WINTER WHEAT Since the date of seeding winter wheat varies in farm practice with the season and on different farms in accordance with climatic and labor conditions, an investigation was planned to determine the effect of such variation upon the growth and yield of this crop. Altho there is usually only about a month range in the time of seeding in any one community, the seeding dates of these tests have been dis - tributed thruout the fall, winter, and early spring. This has been done for the purpose of answering a number of questions, namely: (1) Are yields reduced by seeding earlier than the accepted correct date? (2) Approximately when and of how long duration is the best seeding period? (3) What is the effect of seeding wheat so late in the fall that germina - tion and emergence does not occur until the following spring? (4) To what extent is the popular theory true that yields will be satisfactory if the wheat does not come up until spring, provided the seed had been subject to freezing temperatures in the soil?

Wheat seeded as late as February 9 and March 4 was still subject to severe freezing temperatures, but their respective yields were only one-third and one-sixth of the normal. These data do not support the theory that the mere matter of freezing is highly beneficial to the crop and avoids serious yield reduction when the crop for any reason does not come up until spring. Low yields following late seeding or greatly delayed germination because of dry soil appear to be due to lack of fall stooling and retarded spring develop - ment and maturity which subject the crop to drought, heat, and rust complications.

The same general relations between time of planting and yields held for both sorts. Altho Kanred heads and ripens about 1 day earlier than Nebraska No, 60 when seeded in the fall, it averages 2 days later when seeded in early spring. As an average for the fall seeding dates, Kanred slightly surpasses Nebraska No. 60, whereas the latter excels when seeded in the spring. Wheat seeded abnormally late in the fall does not develop as many stools and results in a thinner stand than early seeding. This may be partly counterbalanced by seeding an additional peck per acre. On the other hand, spring seeded winter wheat stools profusely, but fails to head out normally. Wheat sown in the fall which for any reason does not come up until spring cannot be expected to yield well in eastern Nebraska. With an approach to - ward western Nebraska, where a cooler summer climate prevails, much less reduction from this cause is experienced. There appears to be an optimum planting period of about a week to 10 days duration under normal conditions. In years of Hessian Fly prevalence it is desirable to delay seeding until the latter part of this period which usually coincides with the " fly-safe date " as established by the State Ento - mologist. RATE OF PLANTING Turkey Red winter wheat has been seeded at 5 distinct rates during the 5-year period 1919-1923. The annual and average results recorded in Table 46 indicate that there may be a wide variation in the amount of seed sown per acre without a corresponding effect upon yield of grain. Wheat sown at the rates of 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 pecks per acre gave the respective yields of 28.6, 30.4, 30.5, 31.5, and 30.7 bushels per acre. Seeding thinner than 4 pecks per acre is not recommended for eastern Nebraska conditions. Five pecks is regarded as the most practical rate for this section, since it results in a more; satisfactory stand in years of severe winterkilling than does a thinner seeding. A gradual reduction in stool - ing rate from 4.3 to 1.8 stools per plant accompanied an in - crease in rate of planting. </seg>

Five years, 1 91 9- 1 923 RATE PLANTING TEST WITH TURKEY AND MARVELOUS WHEAT A semihard variety of winter wheat known as Marvelous was introduced and extensively exploited by seedmen, about 10 years ago. It was especially recommended for an alleged stooling capacity far greater than that possessed by other winter wheat of the Turkey Red type. Because of this alleged quality a planting rate of only two pecks per acre was recommended as optimum, and it became known as " Half Bushel Wheat." This variety was compared with Turkey Red during a 5-year period at the seeding rates of 2 and 5 pecks per acre. The 5-peck rate (Table 47) surpassed the 2-peck rate 4.5 bushels in case of the Marvelous and 3.1 bushels in case of the Turkey. The Turkey surpassed the Marvelous 3.7 bushels at the 2-peck rate and 2.3 bushels at the 5-peck rate. In these tests the Turkey Red stooled 10 per cent more than the Marvelous.

Earlier data obtained during 1902-1906, by Montgomery, had suggested an increase of 5 bushels per acre from rolling, and a reduction of 1 bushel from harrowing. Spring rolling has been regarded as bene - ficial in years of severe cracking and drying out of the soil, and in case of very loose soil. PASTURING AND MOWING TO PREVENT LODGING Under field conditions of high soil fertility and moisture where lodging is promoted by excessive rankness, spring pasturing is recognized to reduce this luxuriant vegetative growth and lodging. Some data bearing on the subject, to - gether with the effect of clipping the growing crop at various dates to reduce its vegetative growth, have been secured. Only 1 year of these investigations, 1919, was especially con - ducive to lodging. Neither pasturing nor clipping could possibly have been of benefit by way of reducing lodging in Fig. 22. — A low lying field of bottom land Turkey Red winter wheat just before harvest, showing the effect of spring mowing to reduce lodging. When apparent on April 25 that this increase field was likely to lodge because of its rank growth, the left half was mowed with an ordinary farm mower to a height of 5 inches — the wheat at that time being 9 inches tall. As seen in the picture the mowed portion lodged decidedly less than the unmowed. Except under severe lodging conditions, spring clipping has usually reduced the yield. </seg>

The results from the pasturing and mowing test in 1919 (Table 51) are typical of what may be expected on very fertile soil in a favorable growing season. A rather uniform 2-acre wheat field which had been heavily manured was divided into 3 sections. One was fenced and pastured, one was mowed, and one was untreated. Several head of cattle per acre were grazing on the pastured area during most of the period of March 31 to April 30, except during several days of wet weather. The pasturing was equivalent to 60 cow-days per acre and the feed derived was estimated by the Animal Husbandry Department to have been equivalent to 1,600 pounds of alfalfa hay. In addition to providing this feed, pasturing increased the production from 14 bushels for the unpastured to 18.7 bushels per acre. That part of the field which was mowed to a height of 5 inches April 30, when 12 inches tall, yielded 16.1 bushels per acre. Pasturing and mowing reduced the lodging, and reduced the plant height 2 and 4 inches respectively.

            <seg id="p116">116 Nebr. Agr. Exp. Station, Research Bulletin 31 pastured down short during a brief period of several days in the latter part of April. For the purpose of determining the effects of clipping on lodging, and also the precautions to be taken in connection with spring pasturing or mowing, duplicate nursery blocks of winter wheat were clipped to 3 different heights on 4 dates at 5 day intervals, during 6 different years. Since no lodging occurred under these conditions in any of the 6 years, the data which are given in Table 53 serve only to indicate the effect of clipping upon the growth and produc - tion of wheat under conditions free from lodging. The aver - age date and height of the wheat when clipped were: April 30, 9 inches; May 5, 11 inches; May 10, 14 inches; and May 15, 18 inches. The date for the first clipping was arbi - trarily chosen when the wheat reached the height of 9 inches, since it was thought unlikely that wheat would be mowed in farm practice, to prevent lodging, before it had attained that height. In all cases, the later and shorter the wheat was clipped the lower was the yield. Clipping April 30 to 5, 3, and 1.5 inches yielded 27.2, 25.4, and 20.1 bushels per acre compared with 28.7 bushels for the undipped. Clipping May 5 to 5, 3, and 1.5 inches yielded 19.9, 16.5, and 11.0 bushels. Clipping May 10 to 5, 3, and 1.5 inches yielded 14, 10.8, and 7.3 bushels per acre. Clipping May 15 to 5, 3, and 1.5 inches yielded 8.1, 5.7, and 3.3 bushels per acre. The re - ductions in grain yield were accompanied by a thinning of stand, reduction in mature height and straw weight, and delay in maturity. Where injury from clipping results, this is closely associated with the growth characteristics of the plant. The young spikes which ultimately bear all of the grain have their origin under ground and are simply carried up - ward on the end of the culm during growth. This elongation of the culm and emergence of the head from the soil begins with early spring growth. The nature of the young wheat plant is shown diagrammatically in Figs. 23 and 24. Mowing or grazing off this head destroys the further development of the culm. Only the undecapitated culms can continue their growth and mature a crop. Early spring culm development is somewhat delayed by delayed time of seeding. In a few extreme cases of lodging under observation, mowing high when the wheat was about 1 foot tall made harvesting possible whereas the unmowed portion of the field left as a check was a total loss. </seg>

The leaves were removed at the ligules from duplicate quadrats of Turkey winter wheat 3, 10, and 17 days after heading, respectively. These quad- rats were harvested when ripe and compared for yield with the unstripped wheat. As an average for the 4 years (Table 54), the wheat having leaves removed 3, 10, and 17 days after heading yielded 28.6, 32.4, and 35.4 bushels per acre respectively, compared with 36.9 bushels for the unstripped wheat. An average of 28 days was required to mature after heading. This information may be of interest in connection with the effects of premature drying and dying of the leaves. resulting from natural causes such as a severe attack of leaf rust.

Approximately 1500 main culms with heads equally advanced were tagged each year when in full head and apparently just fertilized. Be - ginning with 4 days after fertilization, 50 or more system - atically distributed wheat heads were harvested at 2-day in - tervals until maturity wa3 reached.

Table 55 records the green kernel weights, moisture content, moisture free weight, and the per cent of total mature kernel weight for the various intervals for each of the 4 years. The time required from heading until dead ripe was 30 days in 1922, 1923, and 1924, and 32 days in 1920.

The per cent nitrogen-free extract gradually in - creased to a maximum at the twenty-second day and was followed by a slight reduction of 1 per cent. The high ether extract of the young kernel, 4 to 6 days after fertilization, is not very significant of the actual fat content because, as is generally recognized, it contains considerable chlorophyll at this stage of development. The data regarding the pro - tein content of the kernel in its later stages of development do not substantiate a rather commonly held opinion that the protein is largely laid down early in the matrix of the kernel and that its percentage is, later, materially reduced by the filling in of starch. These results are confirmed by 5 years' protein determination for Turkey Red winter wheat (Table 57), harvested at 3 stages of maturity. The protein content in the early dough, late dough, and ripe stages was 12.4, 12.7, and 13.0 per cent respectively. EFFECT OF HARVESTING WINTER WHEAT BEFORE MATURITY Two tests were made during the 5-year period of 1919 - 1923, to determine the effect upon grain yield from harvest - ing wheat at several stages of maturity. (1) Duplicate thirtieth-acre plats of Turkey Red wheat (Table 57) were harvested an average of 22, 26, and 29 days after heading, when in the early dough, late dough, and ripe stages, respec - tively. The average yields of grain per acre were: early dough, 23.7 bushels; late dough, 28.8 bushels; and ripe, 30.9 bushels. Wheat when cut at the two earlier stages yielded 77 per cent and 93 per cent respectively of the fully ripe wheat. (2) In a second test (Table 58), ten systematically dis - tributed quadrats were harvested at each of 5 stages of maturity from a plat of Turkey wheat. As an average for the 4 years 1920-1923, wheat in the milk, early dough, medium dough, stiff dough, and mature stages, harvested an average of 16, 18, 21, 25, and 28 days after coming in full head, yielded respectively 21.5, 26.2, 31.6, 33.5, and 34.6 bushels per acre. The average relative kernel weights were 59, 75, 88, 97, and 100 per cent, respectively, while the corre - sponding relative grain yields per acre were 64, 76, 92, 97, and 100 per cent.

SEASONAL VARIATION IN THE LENGTH OF FRUITING PERIOD The length of fruiting period between heading and matur - ity of Turkey Red winter wheat has averaged 31 days at the Agricultural Experiment Station (Table 59) during the 21-year period 1903 to 1923.

            <seg id="p126">126 Nebr. Agr. Exp. Station, Research Bulletin 31 WINTERKILLING OF WHEAT It is a rather common belief that rupture of the plant root by heaving of the soil and smothering by sleet or ice are the chief or sole causes of the winterkilling of wheat. Observations, however, lead to the conclusion that these are only minor causes of infrequent occurrence in Nebraska. The prime causes for failure to survive the winter are (1) freez - ing to death by extreme cold, and (2) desiccation resulting from moisture shortage. Such winterkilling as that illus - trated in Figs. 12, 13, and 16 is due solely to low temperature beyond the point of endurance by the varieties in question. The less hardy strains, such as W as ni n gt° n Hybrid No. 143 and Red Rock from Michigan, winterkill decidedly in years when the hard winter wheats escape injury. A second degree of hardiness may be illustrated by such wheats as Marvelous, Nebraska No. 28, and probably Blackhull. These survive the majority of our winters in a satisfactory manner but come thru the winter with much reduced stands oftener than the standard hard winter wheats of the Turkey type, which comprise a third group. Blackhull has not been grown in Nebraska by either farmers or the Experiment Station longer than 3 years. During this period the winters have been rel - atively mild and opportunity has not been afforded for a good test of the winter hardiness of this variety. Lack of cold resistance is indicated, however, by the fact that the leaves were killed back by frost in the spring of 1923 to a greater extent than in case of the relatively non-hardy Ne - braska No. 28. In a winter hardiness test conducted by the United States Department of Agriculture, at 20 points in the United States and Canada, Blackhull has proved de - cidedly less winter hardy than Kanred or Nebraska No. 60. A fourth degree of winter hardiness is seen in a number of selected strains of hard winter wheat such as Minturki, Minhardi, Kanred, and Nebraska No. 60. The 2 former selections by the Minnesota Station are outstandingly hardy, tho their relative value in the main hard winter wheat belt has not yet been established. While Nebraska No. 60 and Kanred are noticeably more hardy than common Turkey Red in years of partial winterkilling, yet the resistance is only a matter of degree, and even these may winterkill decidedly in such rare winters as 1916-1917. The fifth and most winter-resist - ant group is represented by Buffum No. 17 and Odessa, both </seg>
            <seg id="p127">Winter Wheat Investigations 127 of which are late maturing and low yielding. Efforts are being made to combine the extreme winter hardiness of these and the Minnesota strains with the productivity of other strains by hybridization. The winterkilling in 1917 which reduced the acreage sur - viving in Nebraska to 597,000 acres from an original plant - ing of 3,375,000 acres appears to have been due largely to excessively low temperature while in an unprotected condition without snow covering. Much of the winterkilling that occurred in Nebraska dur - ing the winter of 1922 to 1923 was to a considerable extent due to the wheat drying out. With an unusual shortage of soil moisture, much of the wheat did not come up until No - vember, with no opportunity for fall stooling or much root development. The outcome was a dry, loose seed bed bearing poorly rooted and undeveloped seedlings. Strong March winds caused the drying up and blowing out of much wheat. The recuperation of wheat following severe winterkilling is often remarkable. With favorable weather conditions in the spring, wheat which was severely but rather uniformly winterkilled to the extent of 80 per cent in the year 1918 still yielded 40 bushels per acre. It is enabled to do this by heavy spring stooling under favorable weather conditions. In years when the soil is loose or badly cracked in the spring at the time wheat resumes its growth, rolling with a corrugated roller aids in the revival of weakened plants by firming the soil in contact with the roots. Wheat growing on compact seed beds is much less subject to winterkilling than on loose seed beds. RUST RESISTANCE OF WINTER WHEAT All varieties and strains of winter wheat tested at the Nebraska Experiment Station are more or less susceptible under farm conditions to orange leaf rust and black stem rust. The amount of rust is variable with the season, rang - ing from a mere trace in many years to occasional epidemics as occurred in 1920. (Fig. 27.) Severe losses to grain yield caused by black stem rust are infrequent. Kanred is the only winter wheat that has proved materially more rust resistant than common Turkey Red. Comparative results for 1920 when rust was severe are given in Table 19. Kanred showed 19 per cent rust against 49 per cent for common Turkey Red. Nebraska No. 28 had a low percentage of rust in this test due to rust evasion by virtue of its earliness. The difference </seg>
            <seg id="p128">Nebr. Agr. Exp. Station, Research Bulletin 31 128 in favor of Kanred has been very noticeable on Nebraska farms until 1923 when Kanred appears to have rusted as badly as Turkey Red. This relative difference in seasonal rust resistance of Kanred compared with other varieties may be related to the ecological relation of host, climate, and Cist form. It may also be possible that the rust forms to hich Kanred is susceptible are gaining wider distribution with the more extensive use of this strain. Climatic con - ditions resulted in unusually delayed maturity in 1923 in Western Nebraska where the rust was especially severe. The increased infection of Kanred by black stem rust under field conditions in the case of delayed maturity was apparent in 1920 in connection with clipping experiments. Kanred wheat was clipped at various dates and heights with the effect of a material delay in time of heading in some cases. In this test, Kanred wheat coming into full head on the dates of June 11, 14, 16, 18, and 28, July 5, and July 8, gave respective black stem rust percentages at maturity of 12, 15, 18, 25, 35, 55, and 67 per cent. PREVENTION OF STINKING SMUT IN WINTER WHEAT Winter wheat strains immune to stinking smut have been reported by the Oregon and Washington Experiment Sta - tions. Altho the value of these strains has not yet been established for Nebraska conditions, it appears that we may at least hope thru hybridization or selection to develop suit - able smut resistant wheat. When thoroly inoculated with stinking smut spores before planting, Ridit winter wheat from the Washington Experiment Station and Turkey Red No. C. I. 1571 from the Oregon Experiment Station each developed 0.5 pep cent smutted heads compared with 65.2 and 66.2 per cent for Kanred and Nebraska No. 60, respec - tively. Stinking smut has never been a serious problem in east - ern Nebraska until very recent years. Except in special smut experiments, no winter wheat seeded at the Nebraska Experiment Station has ever been treated for smut. It is seldom that even a trace of smut has been observed in the crop. Few farmers in eastern Nebraska have found it desir - able to treat wheat for smut until recent years. Smut ap - pears to have been more commonly prevalent since the ex - tensive importations of Kanred wheat seed, which was some - what infected in many cases. Field inspection on some east - ern Nebraska farms has shown as high as 20 per cent </seg>
            <seg id="p129">Winter Wheat Investigations 129 smutted plants, while infection as high as 80 per cent has occurred in the western part of the state. The only effective remedies for the present can be the sub - stitution of seed from smut-free fields or seed treatment. Both the wet formalin and dry copper carbonate dust treatments applied by standard methods have proved effective in smut prevention. RELATION OF AMOUNT OF STINKING SMUT TO YIELD AND QUALITY OF WHEAT In the fall of 1923, 6 lots of untreated Kanred winter wheat known to differ in degree of smut infection were planted in comparative field plat tests. Determinations were made before harvest in 1924 of the percentage of smutted heads in the crops grown from this seed. The result - ing crops (Table 60) containing 0, 3, 8, 12, 42, and 63 per cent of smutted heads yielded respectively 34.7, 31.8, 28.2, 26.5, 20.7, and 16.3 bushels per acre and tested 60.5, 59.5, 59.0, 58.0, 55.0, and 50.0 pounds per bushel. The badly smutted samples produced threshed grain containing a large amount of smut and having a very bad odor. Table 60. — Relation of degree of smut infection to yield of grain per acre. Kanred wheat, 192b EFFECT OF SEED TREATMENTS FOR STINKING SMUT UPON THE YIELD AND QUALITY OF WHEAT Seed corresponding with the smut free sample and with the two heaviest infected samples of wheat just described were planted in the fall of 1923 after being given the standard formalin treatment by the dipping method, using a solution of one pint formalin (40 per cent formaldehyde solution) to 40 gallons of water.

It was then spread out thin to hasten drying, when it was ready to plant. Similar wheat samples were treated dry with copper carbonate by revolving in a barrel for a period of two minutes with 2 ounces of copper carbonate dust, con - taining 50 per cent copper, to each bushel of wheat. These were planted in comparison with each other and with the untreated seed (Table 61). The crops grown from the untreated seed of these three samples contained .5, 38, and 63 per cent smutted heads and yielded 35.1, 27.5, and 20.6 bushels of grain per acre which tested 59.8, 55.0, and 52.8 pounds per bushel respectively. The corresponding yields from the formalin treated plats were 36.0, 33.1, and 34.7 bushels, which tested 59.3, 59.0, and 58.5 pounds per bushel, respectively. Corresponding yields from the seed treated with copper carbonate were 36.0, 34.0, and 35.3 bushels per acre, with respective test weights of 59.3, 59.0, and 58.0 pounds per bushel. This dry method has a very marked advantage over the old wet method in that there is no danger whatever to the germination of the seed.

On the other hand, there is no danger whatever of too strong a dosage with the copper carbonate. More of this powder may be applied without harm, but it will be of no benefit, since 2 ounces per bushel is all that may be made to adhere to the grain. Supplementary tests have indicated that a 20 per cent copper product is as effective as the 50 per cent copper preparation. In farm practice some device should be used, in apply - ing the copper carbonate, to hold the dust and prevent its inhalation by the operator. Altho machines for this pur - pose are now on the market, suitable apparatus may be very cheaply devised on the farm. A barrel concrete mixer serves the purpose very well by having a cloth tied over the open end of the container. A strong barrel suspended on a frame at each end by means of an axle with crank attached makes a good homemade machine. A trap door with cover should be cut into the side of the barrel for inserting and remov - ing the grain and copper carbonate powder. A revolving box with hinged coyer, suspended at diagonal corners, has also proved very satisfactory equipment. </seg>
            <seg id="p132">132 Nebr. Agr. Exp. Station, Research Bulletin 31 THE HISTOLOGICAL ADAPTATION OF WHEAT DISTINCTION BETWEEN HEREDITARY AND SOMATIC EFFECTS Investigations were made in 1922 bearing upon the ques - tion of the histological adaptation of wheat to environmental conditions. These data may impart some information re - garding the inheritance of " acquired characters " in wheat. By adaptation we mean in this paper the hereditary acquisi - tion or modification of some character or quality which causes the plant to be better suited and more productive in its environment. In discussing this problem a distinction must be made between heritable adaptive changes and mere so - matic variations induced by differences in external factors. Since the leaf is the seat of such important functions as photosynthesis and transpiration, it would seem that im - portant histological adaptations, if such occur, should be found there. These investigations have been restricted to a study of leaf structure (Figs. 28-30). The environmental factors under consideration were re - gional and largely climatic. Chief among these factors was the relative favorableness of moisture conditions. The plan was to compare the leaves of wheat differing in source of seed but grown, in the one case comparably at the Experi - ment Station, and in the other case in their native localities. The plants grown at the Experiment Station should exhibit hereditary differences, if any, whereas the differences be - tween wheats grown in their native localities might be due to the combined environmental effect plus heredity. The seed sources range from Lincoln, Nebraska, as the most favorable locality, with an average rainfall of 27.5 inches, to Nephi, Utah, with an annual rainfall of 13.4 inches. North Platte, Valentine, and Kimball, Nebraska, and Boze - man, Montana, with respective average annual rainfalls of 18.9, 22.5, 15, and 18.7 inches, were intermediate points used in the tests. 1 The uppermost leaves were harvested from 20 represent - ative plants of each planting when they reached the heading stage. These were preserved immediately in formalin alcohol. The material from distant sources was collected by the experiment stations and substations located at those points. » These precipitation data, supplied by W. D. Bancroft of the U. S. Weather Bureau, are averages for the respective periods of 40, 19. 49. 85, 20, and 24 years. </seg>

The microscopic sections were largely made freehand from material placed between strips of elder pith. From 50 to 200 measurements were averaged for each of the characters for each lot of wheat. The results for Marquis spring wheat, Kubanka spring wheat, and Turkey Red winter wheat are given in Tables 62, 63, and 64, respectively, and are summarized in Table 65. Averaging the 3 varieties and comparing the leaf develop - ment of central (North Platte) and western (Nephi and Bozeman) acclimated wheat with eastern (Lincoln) wheat as a 100 per cent basis, we have the following relative results: (1) leaf thickness, (a) grown at Lincoln 100, 105, and 103, and (b) native grown 100, 100, and 94; (2) average of upper and lower epidermis, (a) grown at Lincoln 100, 103, and 97, and (b) native grown 100, 93, and 85; (3) average thick - ness of cuticle, (a) grown at Lincoln 100, 101, and 102, and (b) native grown 100, 103, and 101; (4) number of vascular bundles in 1 cm. of cross section, (a) grown at Lincoln 100, 99, and 105, and (b) native grown 100, 101, and 109; (5) number of stomata per square mm., (a) grown at Lincoln 100, 99, and 104, and (b) native grown 100, 120, and 147; (6) average length of stomata, (a) grown at Lincoln 100, 101, and 98, and (b) native grown 100, 93, and 83; (7) average length of stomatal aperture, (a) grown at Lincoln 100, 102, and 100, and (b) native grown 100, 92, and 78; (8) average length of epidermal cell, (a) grown at Lincoln 100, 109, and 100, and (b) native grown 100, 71 and 61; (9) average width of epidermal cell, (a) grown at Lincoln 100, 102, and 97, and (b) native grown 100, 98, and 91. While there is some variation in the reactions from the different varieties as shown in the tables, their average (Table 65) indicates no significant hereditary histological adaptation. The histological differences observed between plants actually grown under relatively favorable and less favorable climatic conditions cannot be regarded as adaptive in their nature. They are merely growth correlations asso - ciated with the general well known reduction in plant vigor and size resulting from unfavorable conditions. Because of such adverse conditions, the size of the vegetative unit, the cell, is reduced. This accounts for the reduction under adverse conditions of leaf and epidermal thickness, and for the reduced size of stomata and epidermal cells. It would also account for the increased number of stomata per unit </seg>

The average reduction of 22 per cent in length of stomatal aperture might be explained as an adaptive reaction to reduce transpirational water loss were it not accompanied by a 47 per cent increase in the number of stomata per unit leaf area. No measurable differ - ences were observed in the compactness of mesophyll cells. COMPARISON OF REGIONAL TYPES It was thought of interest to compare histologically vari - eties that are generally recognized as best suited to widely different regional conditions. Turkey Red, Poole, and White Club (Washington Hybrid 143) are representative winter varieties from the " hard red winter," " semihard red winter " and " soft white winter " wheat regions of the United States. Marquis and Kubanka are common and durum spring varieties extensively grown under the more favorable and less favorable moisture conditions of the country, respectively. The histological differences (Table 66) found between the varieties in either the winter or the spring group cannot be explained as adaptive in their nature. While no histological adaptation to environment is shown by these results, we cannot lose sight of the fact that varieties actually differ in their suitability for specific conditions. This is considered due to other qualities than histological differences. COMPARATIVE YIELDS OF WINTER WHEAT AND RYE Three varieties of winter rye have been compared for yield (Table 67) with Nebraska No. 60 Turkey Red winter wheat, during the 5-year period 1919-1923. The test was made in nursery blocks replicated systematically 10 times. Rosen and Advance rye are 2 high yielding varieties introduced, re - spectively, by the Michigan and South Dakota Experiment Stations. They have yielded 2.4 and 2.0 bushels more per acre than the Common rye, which has been largely used in this state. The actual average yield in pounds per acre for the 5-year period is 1602 pounds for the rye and 1650 pounds for Nebraska No. 60 winter wheat. These yields equal 27.9 and 27..5 bushels per acre for the rye and wheat. </seg>

            <seg id="p143">Winter Wheat Investigations 143 COMPARATIVE YIELDS OF WINTER WHEAT AND OTHER CROPS AT THE NEBRASKA EXPERIMENT STATION The yields obtained at the Nebraska Experiment Station for winter wheat, oats, and corn (Table 68), during the 22 - year period 1902-1923, were 34, 52, and 53 bushels per acre, respectively. Spring wheat and soy beans may be included in the comparison during the last 15 years, with the follow - ing results: winter wheat 33 bushels, spring wheat 18 bushels, oats 51 bushels, corn 46 bushels, and soy beans 17 bushels per acre. CORRESPONDENCE OF FIELD PLAT AND NURSERY YIELDS Since much preliminary testing of strains and varieties for yield is done in small grain nurseries, it becomes of in - terest to know the extent to which these nursery results may be an index of relative field performance. Comparing Tables 69 and 70, it will be seen that 14 strains of Turkey Red wheat have been compared with the original variety during a period of years in both field plats and nursery blocks. It must be borne in mind in connection with these tests that the nursery and field plats have always been in different fields and that the nursery has usually been planted several days later. For these reasons one could not expect complete concordance in yields. But the differences in place and time were such as may occur at any Experiment Station in the conduct of nursery and field experimentation. The actual and relative annual yields for both methods of testing are reported for 14 Turkey Red strains and the original wheat in Table 69. The field plat yields are aver - ages for 3 or more replicate thirtieth- or fortieth-acre plats, while the nursery yields are averages of 10 replicate 5-row blocks 16 feet long and having the border rows discarded. As an average for the 7 years, the original Turkey ranked fourteenth in both nursery and field plats, while strain No. 78 yielded fifteenth in both tests. The strain No. 60 ranked first in the field plats and second in the nursery. Strain No. 11 ranked first in the nursery and fourth in the field. The 4 highest yielding strains in the nursery exceeded the original (check) an average of 9.1 per cent, whereas the same strains grown in field plats surpassed the original (check) an average of 8.3 per cent. </seg>

            <seg id="p149">Winter Wheat Investigations 149 The tests corresponded further in that none of the 14 strains except one in each test averaged less than the original wheat. Averaging all strains except No. 78, which has not been selected because of high yield, increases of 5 and 6 per cent over the original wheat are shown respectively for the nursery and field tests. The 2 methods of testing show great inconsistency in the annual results, and the data indicate the value of prolonged testing over a period of years. When the 7 years' data for the individual strains are assembled in 5 successive averages of 3 years each, it is apparent that relative excellence may not be conclusively established in tests of such short dura - tion. EFFECTS OF THE FREQUENCY OF REPLICATION AND DUR - ATION OF THE TEST IN NURSERY TRIALS The annual results for the 14 strains and original Turkey Red considered in the preceding discussion are so compiled in Table 70 as to compare the average yields from 3 and from 10 replicate nursery blocks during various periods of 3 years each as compared with a 7-year period. A study of the actual and relative yields and rankings in the tables suggests that great inconsistency in relative yields may result from in - adequate replication or duration of nursery tests. The literature dealing with these problems is so extensive that omission of and bibliography has been necessary. [5M1 </seg>
