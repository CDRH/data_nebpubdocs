It has been my practice to advise the board the value of the land, also the county treasurers, and the applicants were given </seg>
            <seg id="p017">17 B privilege of purchasing at such prices, or to ask that the be reappraised by freeholders of the county. Appraise - ts made by the freeholders have invariably been as high or er than the price fixed by this office. Under the law prior to July 9, 1897, a lessee was given the right to make application to purchase, and the law further pro - vided that the land should be appraised at its full value. The applicant to purchase should not object to a fair appraisement and the appraisers ought to keep the law in mind when so act - ing. They should not consider the length of time a man has lived on the land, the amount of rental he has paid for the use of it, nor the amount paid for the lease, if purchased from another, neither should they appraise it at what it was worth five or ten years ago, nor what it may be worth ten years in the future, but what it is worth at the date of application to purchase. So much of the state land has been sold at $7.00 and $8.00 per acre that it seems quite difficult to have school lands valued at a fair price compared with like lands in that vicinity. EThe legislature has very generously given the holder of a e executed prior to July 9, 1897, the right to re-lease for an itional period of 25 years without competition, so if the ap - ser will follow the law, the State School Fund will not suf - and the lessee may buy, if he so desires, or when his lease ires secure another lease for 25 years. The law of 1905 provides that an applicant to purchase shall pay the expense of this department in reveiwing the appraisement ; former laws made no such provision, and as it is to the interest of the state that all lands sought to be purchased be examined, it seems but fair that the cost be paid by the state. The following table shows acreage sold in each county, the first appraisement and amount sold for after review. </seg>

Discount on Bonds, etc. 21,583.24 $1,318,609.47 It will be noticed that the above apportionments are made up of four principal items, viz: State School Tax, Interest on lands sold. Rental on lands leased and Interest on securities held by the permanent school fund. While under the revenue law of 1904 the valuation of taxable property in the state has been greatly increased, we find that the a paid to the state school fund for 1905 and 1906 are leas than under the old revenue law. Interest on lands sold has rapidly decreased owing to the gen- eral good times and financial condition of our people and to the further fact that many of our contract holders can borrow money for a lower rate than 6 per cent which is the rate of interest paid the state on all money due on sale contracts. For above rea- sons the common school and saline lands under sale contract have cecreased from 566,805.13 acres December 1, 1896 to 220,579.37 acres December 1, 1906, and the annual interest paid to the state necessarily decrease. The Land Commissioner's reports do not give the unpaid principal on common school and saline lands separately but in- clude the University, Agricultural College and Normal School Lands, but to show the large decrease on sale contracts I submit the total principal due on all educational land sale contracts at the end of each biennium : </seg>
            <seg id="p022">22 Eill be noticed that the interest for 1899 on principal due ber 1, 18 127. 38 while interest for 1905 based icipal due December 1. 1904 was but $132,522.74. The un - terest now due the state is insignificant. The only way that t can be increased is for the Commissioner to see that when sold, are appraised at their full value. Rental on common school and saline lands under lease contract has increased fr 141.72 for 18!»7 and 1898 to $341,735.40 for 1905 and 1906, and this too with 1.916,047.10 acres of land subject to lease December 1. 1896 while on December 1, 1906 re but l.S27.7f&gt;4.33 acres, more than 88,000 acres of the best -land having been sold. This large increase in rental is due to two reasons, first: The interest taken by the Commissioner in keeping all unsold lands under lease and earning rental. By the table above it will be noticed that on December 1, 1898, 865,514.95 acres of the school la were not leased, while on December 1, 1906, but a few small tracts containing in all 18 acres, are not leased ; Second, nt of the land for lease purposes which has greatly ased the valuation of the lands. None of the school lands were reappraised prior to Mr. Follmer's term as Commissioner, and lands in eastern Nebraska were leased on the same valuation £8 made 20 or 25 years ago. B lands are sold the total valuation for rental purposes must ase except as the unsold lands increase in value, and are raised for lease purposes. I? interest on bonds and warrants belonging to the perma - ol fund is incr. s principal on sale contracts is into the state treasury, but not in the same proportion for ■I that interest rates on I'urities are much lower ten years ago. PERMANENT SCHOOL FUND.

Total interest bearing value permanent fund $12,592,399.34 At the rate of increase as indicated by reappraisement when all lease contracts are raised to a reasonable value, and i that are capable of being converted into sale contracts are so transferred and fully paid, it will increase the total interest bear - ing value of the permanent school fund of the state to from TKMPORARY SCHOOL FUND. The temporary school fund is obtained from the following sources : 1. Interest on permanent school securities. 2. Rental on educational lands under lease 3. Interest on valuation of lands held under sale contracts. State school tax of not less than one-half per cent, nor re than one and one-half per cent, on the assessed valuation. 5. Bonus received as a premium to secure lease contracts. 6. Interest on delinquent rental. 7. Money received for state licenses, fines, fees, etc. This temporary school fund is apportioned twice a year by the State Superintendent to the different counties in the state for the support of the public schools, and is known as the semi-an - nual apportionment. 0,000 'ermanent common school securities $6,787,243.80 'ermanent university securities 166,060.00 Sultural college securities 433,47131 al endowment securities 71,941.46 Total securities December 1. 1906 $7,458,716.57 'rincipal unpaid sale contracts 2,256,34: 'aluation lease contracts 2,877,340.38 </seg>

In addition to this I have held 83 different auction and myself and deputy have personally visited every tract of land that has been con - 1 into a sale contract. Interest and rental has been well paid up and the number of forfeitures less than in any pr&gt; ing bienniuni. due to the fact that lands are increasing in value and the rule of this department in following the law relative to forfeitures. Celieve the coming hiennium will be one at even greater thousands of lease contracts will expire during this I, lessees will either have to make a new contract or con - vert same into a sale contract. As the state issues a lease for 25 years it is quite important that a reasonable appraisement be had before entering into a new contract. In order for this lo be done a personal examination from this office will be neces - sary. Thousands of sale contracts will also expire. These will have to be extended or deeds issued. Principal upon sale con - tracts which expire within the next two years will amount ap - proximately to one and one half million dollars. This with the decrease of the state debt and the consequent payment of out - standing warrants will open up a wide field for investment bat under the Constitution the Board of Educational Lands and Funds can invest only in Government, State and County bonds and State warrants. It seems to me that an amendment to the State Constitution should be submitted to the voters of the state so I 2 &lt; ■ B I i ill ■ancaater . . | 7W.0OI I 98 OcU 1,460 54 t :nlt 3,ofT no|l </seg>

Bther matter to wltfch I desire to call to your attention is le rate of interest charged by the state upon unpaid princi - sale contracts is six per cent. In the past four years a number of persons have taken deeds upon their lands from the fact that they could secure the money at a less per cent with the same security. As each year goes by I find the tendency to be stronger to make this kind of exchange. Loan companies are making it a business to correspond with sale contract holders and hold out to them a lower interest rate. I see no reason why the state should not let its contract holders have the same rate as that of private interests. When this principal is paid it be - comes a part of the permanent trust fund and is then loaned at not to exceed a three and one half per cent basis. It seems to me that if anyone should have the benefit of the decreased rate it should be the actual holder of state land. I should at least recommend that all new contracts issued by the state for sale purposes be upon a five per cent basis and believe it to the in - terest of the school fund that all unpaid principal on sale con - tracts now due the state, draw interest at five per cent after December 31, 1907, instead of six per cent as contracts provide. There is a clause in the state constitution which states that the trust fund for school purposes shall remain inviolate and undiminished. It is a well known fact that there is due these funds $325,587.50, and it would be well that this amount be re - placed by direction of the coming legislature, either by direct appropriation, the warrant to be issued and held by the State Treasurer, or by the levy of one half mill by a law similar to the Sheldon law passed by the last legislature for the payment of the state debt. The latter would replace the shortage in two years without much increase to the tax payers of the state.

The steel fixtures for the vault used for the storage of gov - ernment field notes, maps, and the records of government stir - in Nebraska, were placed in position early in 1905. Being provided with glass doors and rolling shutters they are a great protection in preserving these invaluable records from dust and other deteriorating agencies. They are a great improvement over the open wooden shelves and closets with which the vault had been heretofore provided. The routine work of the State Surveyor and draughtsman consists of supplying the office force with such data as is re - quired from the records of surveys, making computations, ex - amination of abstracts, making maps for office use and copying field notes and plats of government surveys for the use of coun - ty surveyors and others who may make application for the same, and such other work as may be required by the Commissioner.

A complete general and classified index of their contents has been made, together with a &gt;f the surveying deputies who executed the public but of the territory and state during that period. It is evident, however, that all correspondence is missing from the files from the time of the establishment of the Surveyor General's office at Leaven worth, Kansas, up to Sept. 5, 1855, and from Sept. 3, 1886, to the closing of the office at Plattsmouth, Nebraska.

            <seg id="p039">39 From the history of the complaints as made, it is evident that the cause of trouble has usually originated through a lack of finding the evidence of original government corners in the making of local surveys. During the time and soon after the making of the public surveys by the government, Nebraska was generally settled by young men. No greater satisfaction can be given these land owners than the establishing of the evidence riginal corners where they had previously known them. Therefore great effort is made by this department to secure the ice to prove the existence of original corners. In conclusion, let me say that I have heard of no appeals to the courts from my decision on any of the findings in the above described cases, nor on any findings made by me during the preceding biennium.

I here has been so much said relative to the work done hienniuin by the Board of Public Lands and Build- I shall quote a part of the 14th biennial report as made by ollmer and recommend that a law be passed embodyii t features contained therein : "The large and varied amount of work demanded of each iie state officers who compose the Board of Public Lands pud Buildings, in addition to the supervision of the various in - stitutions, is such that it is impossible for them to look into the ils of the Management of each institution as much as should be done. It is made the duty of this board to examine into the condition of the buildings and grounds, the manner of conduct - he same, as well as to examine the accounts, and records, 11 the institutions and to report quarterly their findiiiL governor. As this cannot be done directly by the full b' I would recommend, as in my former report, that the cor -lature pass a suitable measure, directing that the Board of Public Lands and Buildings appoint a state accountant, who shall have power to investigate the management and fhe \&gt; &gt;rds of the several institutions, to act as clerk of the Board of Purchase and Supplies; to take an inventory of the Mipplies on hand in each institution quarterly, so that the bi act more intelligently upon the estimates for supplies, and heck up the vouchers drawn upon the various funds in : for the supplies furnished these institutions.

            <seg id="p049">Bs Excellency, the Governor, and the Honorable Members the Board of Public Lands and Buildings. Gentlemen : — As warden of the penitentiary of Nebraska, it is a pleasurable duty to submit to you my report for the biennial period commencing December 1, 1904, and closing November 30, 1906. The report, as its perusal will disclose, consists of a few general remarks by the warden ; financial and statistical fig - ures from the clerk's records; a report from the chaplain, who looks after the moral, religious, and educational welfare of the inmates, and a report from the physician, whose department is far from the least important to the institution. I trust that the report will prove entirely satisfactory, both to you and the I do not wish to seem unduly exulted, nor do I wish to plead guilty to false modesty, so I will avoid the latter charge and as - sume the risk of conviction of the former by stating that I believe a full and impartial investigation of the penitentiary premises will show them to be in better condition than ever before in the history of the institution. Careful attention to cleanliness, with - out which, of course, there can be no proper sanitation, has placed the prison on a basis of excellent health ; the latter being the foremost factor in happiness, the conclusion is reached that the inmates are as contented as men can be when deprived of liberty. Contentment goes far toward making men obedient and peaceable, and the result has been that the discipline of the in - stitution has been kept on a fairly high plane with little need of severe corrective measures. The work of the officers and employes in charge of the various departments has been generally satisfactory; personal interest has been manifested in the work ; comparatively few reports have been filed against the inmates in the several shops, and the officers and employes have shown a commendable spirit in overcoming the little difficulties which come to hand from day to day. In this connection I want to thank the deputy warden, Mr. Delahunty, </seg>
            <seg id="p050">50 Khe oth Bcieni assistance they and tin- hearty co-operation with which the; .[■ better condii i&lt; FINANCIAL. The report of the clerk will be found to make a full and e ensive showing of the financial transactions for the institu - the receipts and disbursements of the various funds appr ; by the legislature, as well as the receipts from con - labor. The latter will be found to be somewhat greater for the biennium just closed than for the previous two years. Dur - ing the last biennial period, the sum of $64,833.34 has been earned for the State by the inmates employed by the contractor as against *56.026.09 for the biennium 1902-04. E table relating to State Cash shows that there have been extensive operations in this fund than during the previous al period. Some discussion has been had in regard to the ety of such cash fund, but it seems to be necessary for tying of small emergency claims, as well as larger claims ■ized by the Board of Public Lands and Buildint The private funds of the inmates, of which the warden is the custodian, remain in total about the same as the balance of two years ago. but the number and extent of the transactions have materially increased. During the last biennium. about $34,000 of prisoners' money was handled in this office, an increase of $12, - 000 in the bulk of this business over the previous two years. This large increase, over 50 per cent, has of course added not a little t&lt;&gt; the work of the office. Eder the rules, an inmate may receive through the office any hat his friends or relatives send him. or that he may by overtime in the shops, and he may, once each month, or - ach articles as are not contraband, which articles are deliv - to him through the steward. The matter of overtime is one that is arranged between the contractor and the inmate, and the State gets no part of the money earned by the inmate after the completion of his daily task. The latter is by no means arduous, and nearly every convict in the shops earns more or less money which he may either spend as above indicated, or may save until his discharge. During the biennium one inmate, who has served seven and one-half years, left the institution « which he had saved wholly from </seg>
            <seg id="p051">51 Bvertime earnings. The majority, however, do not husband earnings so carefully, the "rainy day" instinct among the &gt;&gt;ple on the outside. POPULATION. 1 the census table will show that there has been an increase of more than 10 per cent in the prison popula ■ the previous biennium. The biennial report for 19' shows an average of 293.2. while the present report shows an age of 328.2. an increase of - I stated in my last re - when trying to account for the increase over the biennium _\ 1 do not know to what to attribute the enlarged ures unless it can be simply charged to the general growth of the state's population. Kl the only penal institution in Nebraska, however, the ng is excellent, especially when comparison is made with opulation of the prisons of adjacent states. There is no having so few convicts in proportion to the whole popula - m Nebraska, and there is no prison having so few ate innui! There have been bt &gt;pes from the prison during the past two years, and of these only 2 have been successful up to the nt writing, the rest of the men having been captured and returned to the penitentiary. DISCIPLINE. Iie mention was made earlier in this report concerning the line of the penitentiary, which I consider good. The of - and keepers having direct charge of the inmates are care - a rule, and are instructed to maintain discipline with as friction as possible. The grade system, which was adopted at this institution dur - the previous biennium, is gaining adherents wherever it is tried, and it is certainly a success here. As an incentive to good behavior it is far more potent than prospects of solitary confine - ment with meagre fare. When it is understood that a man must conduct himself in accordance with the rules, or be relegated to the stripes, it is generally an easy matter to keep that man on -traight and narrow path. Punishments, which. I am glad to say, are not often required, ;st of isolating the offender, feeding him scantily, and taking away his good time. There have been no serious outbreaks </seg>
            <seg id="p052">52 tong the inmates during the biennium, and the great majority the prisoners have obeyed the rules with cheerfulness. AGRICULTURAL. The legislature showed great wisdom, in my judgment, when it enacted a law at its last session, authorizing the Board of Pub - lic Lands and Buildings to sell at public auction the penitentiary binds situated at a distance from the institution, and to expend the proceeds in acquiring title to lands adjacent to the prison and in improving same. Prom the sale of these" distant lands" the sum of $25,092.00 was derived, and $24,000 of this amount was spent for 240 acres adjoining the penitentiary premises. Pnor to this purchase the penitentiary had but 40 acres of its , and about all of its produce was raised on leased land. Dur - the past two years about 110 acres have been leased in ad - dition to the 280 acres owned by the State, and goodly crops have been the rule. Hail and other unfavorable conditions seriously affected the vegetable crop of the present year, but the general average has been quite satisfactory. K produce of the farm not only enters into the question of ock raising, but it makes possible, at a minimum of c and agreeable variety in the diet of the inmates, whose rt and health are enhanced to no small degree. Ethe tables following will appear a statement of the pro - used in the prison during the biennium, as well as an invoice »t on hand at the close of the period. EDUCATIONAL. ce my last report there has been established a school for the benefit of those prisoners who have the ability and desire to learn, and there is now no reason why any ambitious inmate should not improve his mind during his period of detention. The school is presided over by Dr. P. C. Johnson, the chaplain 'of the penitentiary, with assistants in the persons of some of the more studious of the prisoners. The details of the school work are given in the chaplain's report, which, modestly, does not do jus - tice to the untiring efforts of Dr. Johnson. Ethe chaplain's report, too, will be found particulars relating e church and Sunday School work of the institution, done lselnsh people who devote much of their time on the Sabbath &gt;ors with the men and women of the prison. The library, which is also under the general supervision of </seg>

HEALTH. Brief reference has already been made to the sanitary condi - tion of the penitentiary and its relation to the comfort and con - tentment of the inmates. During the past two years there has been but a single inmate sent to the hospital on account of ill - ness. This is a strong statement, but one which will be borne out by the facts, and by reference to the report of the prison physician, Dr. E. L. Holyoke. I do not think that such a re has ever been made in any penitentiary in the United States, and it certainly breaks the record at this institution. E^s appears in the report of the physician, the most formidable ack upon the health of the institution was made by the measles ich brought down a number of victims, none of whom, how - r. failed to regain his usual health. The inmates, moreover, re not the only ones whom this contagion visited. Kat credit is due to Dr. Holyoke. whose hearty co-operation matters pertaining to the health of the prison I have thor - v appreciated. FEMALE WARD. The female ward at this institution continues to be a source of pride to myself and an object of favorable comment by visitors. The women themselves apparently take pleasure in keeping up the high standard of their department, which, I believe, is the of its kind in the country. The female inmates do not per - form any contract work whatever, their efforts being directed to mending, darning, and needlework of various kinds. The dis - cipline in this ward has continued excellent throughout the bien- The average number of women inmates during the past two years has been 5.4, as compared to 5.6 for the previous biennial »d. The number in prison at present is 9. of whom 3 are white and 6 colored. The average number for the past six month! has been 8.3. although, as above stated, the average for the entire two years has been lower than for the biennium of </seg>
            <seg id="p054">54 LAND COMMISSIONER'S REPORT SUGGESTIONS. I would respectfully recommend that the legislature make suit - eble provision for furnishing transportation for the discharged convict to the place where he was convicted ; or, if he does not wish to return to the place of conviction, for furnishing him with an equivalent amount of transportation in the direction in which move. This plan is adopted by the federal govern - ment in the treatment of their discharged prisoners, and the scheme is also in use in many of the states. In any event, such a plan would relieve the discharged man of a burden, and, per - haps be more acceptable to the citizens of the city in which the penitentiary is located than the present method of simply turn - ing the man loose at the gate. If the legislature should see fit to appropriate, for the main - nce of the prison for the biennium 1906-08, the amount of the proceeds from convict labor during the past two years and also the amount that will be received during the coming bien - pial period, I think the sum thus derived would be ample for the s of the institution. The amount received during the biennium 'd may be ascertained by a glance at the table of the labor fund in the clerk's report. Erould recommend also the purchase, if possible, of the few lying just east of the penitentiary. This acquisition would the prison control of all the land immediaely contiguous to ustitution. as well as add somewhat to the acreage of the entiary farm. Im firmly of the belief that the parole law should be extended elude all men sentenced to the penitentiary, regardless of convictions, and in this connection I would urge the | of a law providing for the appointment and remuneration parole officer, whose duties would be to look after the men sed on parole. Iiluding these remarks, I wish to heartily thank the | • for his personal interest and helpful advice, and the mem - of the Board of Public Lands and Buildings for their uni - ty kind and courteous treatment. Respectfully submitted, A. D. BEEMER, Warden. </seg>

NEBRASKA STATE PENITENTIARY, OFFICE OF THE PHYSICIAN. To the Warden : — I take pride as well as pleasure in submitting a brief report for the biennial period ending November 30, 1906. The report is. of necessity, brief, as there h so little sickness among the prisoners of the institution, and the physician's business has niore to do with the lack of health than its opposite. However, the physician who is true to his teachings is as much interested in maintaining the health of his patient as he is in restoring that health when it is menaced by disease. The result of the sani - tary and dieteti&lt; hich you have made has caused me much gratification, not only because of the excellent record that have made possible in my department, but because of the manifest increase of comfort for the inmates, rendering them more readily tible in treatment when threatened with 1 have follow ,e of treatment as I outlined in </seg>
            <seg id="p081">81 my last report to you, and it may not be out of place to quote substantially what I then said: I has been my policy not to wait until a malady has become developed before attacking it, but where I have found an e in an anaemic condition, to take immediate steps along orative line of treatment, to tone up his system, and, if le, ward off the threatened illness." During the biennium but few serious cases have been encoun - tered, and there has not been a death among the inmates during the period. There has been the unavoidable and to-be-expected number of minor complaints, and about the usual number of in - consequential surgical cases, the most of them no more than in - juries to fingers sustained in operating the machinery and v.ielding the sharp knives used in the manufacture of brooms, but however trivial these wounds may be they occasion the loss of many days because of the nature of the prisoner's occupation. I very seriously doubt whether the record for the last two years at this institution has been equaled at any institution of nature in the country, and there is documentary proof that it is a new record for this institution. I do not claim the credit for this remarkable state of things. It is largely yours as you have, during your administration, directed especial and ener - getic effort toward healthful and sanitary conditions. There is row no congestion in the cellhouses, no disease-breeding piles of rubbish, no inadequate bathing facilities. The culinary depart - ment has been improved, the sewer system amplified, and the various other matters pertaining to good health attended to v.ith rigor and good judgment. I think the state is fortunate, indeed, in having at the head of an institution like this one M appreciation of sanitary and hygienic requirements is so </seg>
