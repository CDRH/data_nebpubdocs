To have a large jly of good fresh vegetables always on hand during the sum - season to furnish an abundance of cheap and wholesome I for the family is a problem that should receive more con - ration in the farm home. The fruits of the kitchen garden lid not be limited to summer use. In addition to this, nearly the vegetables grown may be preserved in some form for ter use, making it unnecessary for the farmer to purchase led vegetables. The canning of garden stufff has often been thought a difficult problem and something that a farmer's wife could not I The Scottsbluff Experiment Farm 1b located on the North Platta tmation Project, six miles east of Mitchell and eight miles northwest ottsbluff, Nebraska. The tract consist of 160 acres of land, irrigated the Government canal. About 30 acres are devoted to experiments y land agriculture, and the remainder is irrigated, a wide variety of riments being conducted with irrigated crops. The work of the farm iintained cooperatively by the University of Nebraska and the U.

            <seg id="p006">Bsrtake. With the guidance of some of the bulletins issued by Department of Agriculture any woman may soon learn to successfully any of the common vegetables. Lack of gardens is more apparent in the West than in the East. The reason advanced is that a garden requires "the best piece of land on the farm" and "considerable time and money." It does require some time and a little money to have a good gar - den, but the actual expenditure of either time or money is not large. The largest cash outlay is for two or three hotbed sashes and a hand cultivator. Where it is possible to purchase most of the early plants desired for transplanting, the sashes may be omitted. The hand cultivator, however, enables a man to do as much work in an hour or two as he can do with a hoe in a whole day, and for that reason saves time and labor, making it an indis - pensable part of the equipment. The only other necessary cash outlay of importance is the seed, which costs but little and which after the first year can be secured largely from the garden The experience gained from maintaining a garden at the Seottsbluff Experiment Farm, on the North Platte Irrigation Project, has shown that excellent garden vegetables can be pro - duced on the irrigated lands of western Nebraska at a trifling co«t of time, labor, and money. The suggestions made in this publication are based primarily on the results secured in the garden discussed below. THE SCOTTSBLUFF GARDEN. I A family garden was maintained at the Scottsbluff Experi - lt Farm' during the seasons of 1911, 1912, and 1913. This den was in no manner connected with any of the regular erimental work of the farm. It received no extraordinary e, and the time devoted to it was such as any farmer may ote to a garden without interfering with his regular work. i actual labor, other than preparation of the ground and ir- Eiting. was all done at odd hours in the morning and evening. It may be rather surprising to many to know that, altho the elevation of the farm is 4,100 feet above sea level, thirty different kinds of vegetables have been successfully grown. The list in - cludes all of the more common ones and several others less well - known that should have a place in the gardens of the irrigated farms of western Nebraska. It was found that by the proper use of irrigation water it is possible to produce an excellent quality of vegetable*. No record was kept of the actual quantity grown, </seg>
            <seg id="p007">fin most cases the yields were satisfactory. Quality always ved first consideration. As a rule, this was secured by using of the proper varieties, by irrigating at the proper time, by harvesting the vegetables before they became too large overgrown. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR SUCCESSFUL GARDENS. LOCATION AND SIZE. One cause of failure and discouragement in connection with fanners' kitchen gardens is that proper attention is not given Fig. 1. — Corn and peanuts planted at different distances, and beans. I the location or to the size of the tract. The garden should be located that it is easily accessible from the house, and it raid be well protected against poultry and other farm animals, garden of one-third to one-half acre should be large enough supply the average family with all the vegetables required and th some small fruit as well. It is always a good plan to grow ne small frnit in connection with the garden. It is usually 'ferable to have the garden tract long and narrow, so that the vs may be made and irrigated the short way. The advantage </seg>
            <seg id="p008">of this method is that when the crop has been harvested from a short row. something else may be planted in that row without interfering with any other crop. It has been found best to plant small amounts of the various vegetables and to make several plantings during the season. For this also the short row is to be preferred. WINDBREAKS. BAs the wind, by whipping the plants about, causes heavy les, a windbreak is found effective in reducing the damage. Fig. 2. — Windbreaks : Russian artemesia in foreground and golden willow in background. t windbreak may be made of willows planted about one foot t, or of other low-growing hedge plants, such as Russian iter. elder, or Russian artemesia. The hedge should be kept med to about four or five feet in height. MANURING. If well-deeaved stable manure can be secured, it is well to give </seg>
            <seg id="p009">I nittublr Cnnhiix on Irrigated Farms in Western Xebraska 9 the garden a good top-dressing during the winter months. Fresh manure containing long, loose straw should not be used, as it is a detriment rather than a lieneftt because of its tendency to cause the soil to dry out too rapidly. The garden soil shouM imt be made too rich. A soil made overrich by heavy manuring and too much irrigation will have a tendency to make an abim dance of leaf growth at the expense of other portions of the plant. i Oeneral vWw of garden, Auzust 10, 1913. The windbreak of Russian artemesia is shown on the right. PALL CARE OF UABDBN TRACT. lu ihc fall, after most of the vegetable! have been harvested. it is wi-ll to irrigate the entire garden. This puts it in Rood shape for the following year. At the end of the gardening mm all reiimaiits of vegetables should be removed and burned or fed to the stock. This is done to destroy any insects that may be harboring on the plant material and to destroy eggx that in - ■trti may have laM in or on the plants during the season. </seg>
            <seg id="p010">10 I i &lt;/&lt; lulih (latiii iik mi I niiintnl t'nnux in Wixttrn Xebraskn I As a number of vegetables remain in the ground until after ■xing. fall plowing every year cannot lie advised, altho ;m rt should be made every two or three years. Garden soil aines more or less puddled and compart during the growing ion because of the necessity of walking (in it regardless of ■ wet it may be. Fall plowing not only loosens the soil. but oses it to the mellowing effect of the winter weather. PREPARING FOR IRRIGATION. I Before the garden is planted, the trait should be carefully pared for irrigation. This preparation consists chiefly in »ling the land to a fairly uniform slope and laying out the r8. In doing this it is well to give them enough fall so that re is no danger of flooding, and not enough fall to cause jhing. A good average slope is about three inches to the GROUP ARRANGEMENT. With a little planning it is possible to make advantageous groupings. Vegetables that require much irrigation should be separated from those that need but little. All perennial crops. such ;is rhubarb, asparagus, etc.. should be located at one end of the garden, as they will then not interfere with the operations connected with the annual plants. Here several rows may he devoted to the growing of cuttings seedlings, etc. IMPORTANCE OF PROPER IRRIGATION. I Several things must 1k» kept in mind when gardening under ration. As a rule, too little water is better than too much, h vegetables of which the leaves or leafstalks are used ;is I. a good vigorous growth is desirable, and such plants can a large amount of water. A slow or retarded growth pro - 's a tough, hard fiber, and often results in poor flavor. For ance. slow growing radishes are stronger I "hotter" I than te that have made a rapid growth. A stunted growth of let - ■ is evidenced by a very bitter taste. With the vegetables that fruit, such as tomatoes and cantaloups, irrigation should lie iheld. if possible, until the fruit sets, and the water should ipplied in limited amounts. Eeeds should not be permitted in the garden, as they take great deal of moisture, are apt to harbor insects, and make iithering of vegetables a task rather than a pleasure. WEEKS ANK INSECT l'ESTS. </seg>
            <seg id="p011">Vegetable Gardens on Irrigated Farms in Western Nebraska 11 f Western Nebraska is comparatively free from insect peats, some difficulty is encountered on their account. All spray - in the garden, when necessary, should be done with the lead date. This is better than Paris green, and as all vegetables washed before using, there is less danger of poisoning. A 11 hand pump may be secured for this work. The solution is e by using two pounds of arsenate of lead to fifty gallons of «r. This should be well stirred in order to dissolve the ar - te of lead. Wherever the use of a spray is recommended in bulletin, arsenate of lead is the spray intended. HOME PRODUCTION OF SEED. It is well for the farmer to save from his own garden many seeds. By exercising a little care and judgment it is possible to improve some of the vegetables from year to year. In breaking beans it is found that some "snap" better than others. The pods are fuller and more evenly developed. It is desirable to locate the plant that produced such beans and allow the pods to make seed. Again, it is found that some plants bear more evenly than others. It is well to drive a stake near these good plants and allow- them to produce seed. Peas often show a greater varia - tion than the beans. Some of the best pea plants should be saved for seed. One cucumber vine may produce a much evener lot of cucumbers than the other plants. A particular tomato plant is seen to have a good stem and hold itself up better than the sur - rounding plants. The fruit is smooth, of good flavor, and has no core. If some attention is paid to such superior plants and some of the fruit is allowed to go to seed, most of the seed may be readily gathered. This means a saving in the seed bill the following spring. SUGGESTIONS REGARDING DIFFERENT GARDEN CROPS. tThe vegetables which have been tried at the Experiment Farm discussed below in alphabetical order. The names of the ieties tried and of those which have produced the best results given. It is not advised that anyone who has a garden uld discard any varieties of vegetables that he may have in er to adopt those suggested in the following paragraphs, but her that he continue to grow what he has, and, in addition, some of the following. It is well to avoid or try with cau - 1 the novelties advertised in seed catalogs. It is not well to end on these for a crop. </seg>
            <seg id="p012">12 Vegetable Gardens on Irrigated Farms in Western Nebraska ARTICHOKES. There are two kinds of artichokes — the Jerusalem and Green Globe. The Jerusalem artichoke forms tubers under the ground. In autumn these tubers are harvested as needed. For table use they are usually creamed. On account of the small size of the tubers, this was not found to be a practical vegetable to grow. Ifhe Green Globe artichoke has large flowers. The buds are portion eaten. The season at Scottsbluff is too short for this it. Altho the terminal buds appeared in some cases, none ined sufficient size for cooking purposes. ASPARAGUS. Only one variety of asparagus, the "Colossal." was tried. As tli is is a perennial plant, it should be located at one end of the garden. There are two ways of starting a bed of asparagus, either by seed or by roots. If seed is planted, it should be soaked in water having a temperature just such that it is not too hot for the fingers at the time the seed is put in. The seeds should remain in this water for 24 hours. The seed is planted in a row. having about 200 plants after they are thinned to about six inches apart in the row. When these plants are one year old they are taken up, and from this time on the method of cultivation is the same as tho the plants wen- secured in place of seed. I he soil should be carefully prepared and made as rich as Me with well-rotted manure. A trench from six to eight s deep is made and the plants placed therein, the roots : distributed as equally as possible on the sides. The plants d be about eighteen to twenty-four inches apart. About three '8 of soil is thrown on the plants and as they grow the re - der of the soil is gradually worked down around them. I About one hundred plants should be sufficient for the average lily. Tf two hundred plants are grown there will be an op - tunity to throw out the poorer, weaker plants as they appear, mid more than one row be desired, the rows are planted four t apart. They should be cultivated regularly and irrigated to p the plants in growing condition. In the late fall or early iter the tops are cut off above the ground and burned. This uld be done each winter. tthe spring of the second year a light cutting of asparagus » made. Early in the spring of the third year it is well to up a ridge of soil directly over the row or to take some </seg>
            <seg id="p013">Vegetable Gardens on Irrigated Farms in Western Nebraska 13 I by four-inch boards and stake them down on each side of the leaving about one foot of space between the boards. This e or bed should be filled with soil. This will give a greater h from the top of the soil to the root, and longer stalks may at. After the cutting season is over, the boards are removed, the ridge is gradually worked down. In cutting asparagus, r the second week, the cuttings should be made lighter, al - ng several stalks of each hill to grow. By the end of the th week cutting should be discontinued. In* the late summer asparagus should be heavily top-dressed with well-rotted nre and then worked in with a cultivator. BEANS. I Two kinds of beans have been grown — string beans and dried ns. Of the string beans, the Yankee Pole, Refugee, and ingless were raised. The Refugee, a wax bean, gave the best isfaction. As a string bean, this variety is very prolific. The Is fill well and are almost entirely free from string. The pods p, even tho they are allowed to get a little old. Next in choice the Yankee Pole rod the Stringlpss. I The pole and bush Lima beans were tried and both proved too ! for local conditions. Altho a small crop of beans was picked in each, the results do not justify the production of this bean western Nebraska. I For dried or shelled varieties, the Navy, Burlingame, Texas, I Mexican were grown. The first two are white beans, the ;as a small yellow, and the Mexican a large white and brown ttled. There is little difference so far as yield is concerned, to flavor, the Texas is very mild; next are the white beans, I then the Mexican with a very strong flavor. |3eans should not be planted until danger of frost is over. \ applies especially to the planting of the dried bean varieties, ns checked by severe cold will never fully recover and pro - ! a large yield. String beans should be planted fairly thickly, seed about every two inches in rows about 22 inches apart. &gt;n the plants are three to four inches high, the weakest should hinned out until the plants stand from eight to ten inches rt in the row. A large planting of string beans should not nade at one time, but a new planting should be made every € weeks. This will produce a succession of tender beans lout the season. For dried beans, the culture is the same as string beans except that the dried beans may be all planted ne time in rows twenty-four inches apart in order to facilitate </seg>
            <seg id="p014">Beans require but little irrigation. By withholding the water until the pods begin to set and then forcing a growth, a much earlier crop may be produced. Too much water and close plant - ing will cause the buds to drop off. Dried beans may be harvested either by pulling the plants and putting them in small piles to cure or by cutting the plants off even with the ground by means of a sharp hoe. When thoroly dry they are threshed out best with sticks or a flail. BEETS. The best varieties tried were: Crimson Globe, Detroit, Dark Bed, and Dark Stimson. There is practically no difference in these varieties. The first planting may be made as soon as any garden operations begin in the spring. This is usually April 15. It is well to make a small planting, allowing the plants to stand about two or three inches apart and the rows about twenty IVhen the beets are being thinned the young plants may be ed and eaten as greens. As the beets increase in size, thin - 1 should be continued as they are used. When the first beets me large enough for table use, a second planting should be e, and later on a third, if the season permits. By successive tings, more tender beets may be had during the season. This table should not be allowed to become too dry and suffer for ;r, but should be kept in ■ fairly good growing condition, soil about the plants should be kept loose. I The beets, when mature, may be kept in a pit or cellar for iter use. They may be piled up the same as potatoes. Mature ts, however, are aiways more or less woody and undesirable the table. Small immature beets will not keep long in storage. ; best method is to can them during the summer. It is beat to use them when they get more than two or two and a half hes in diameter. The smaller the beets the more tender they BRUSSELS SPROUTS. ■This vegetable is very much like cabbage. It differs from that nt in that it bears small buds about an inch in diameter, ich are clustered about the stem in the axils of the leaves. For an early crop the seed may be sown — in a hotbed or in boxes — some time between the first and middle of March. After the middle of April, when the plants are six inches high, they are ■et out in the garden in rows three feet apart, the plants being about eighteen to twenty-four inches apart in the row. For late </seg>
            <seg id="p015">{ting the seed is sown in a small seed bed outdoors, and from the plants may be transplanted to the garden. The late ing is usually made about May 15 to June 1. In transplant - the Brussels sprouts should be set deeper than they were in original place. They should be set as deep as the base of the leaf. I When many butterflies are observed about these plants, it will found that soon thereafter worms begin to work on the crop, soon as the worms are noticed the plants should be thoroly ayed. It is best to irrigate so as to keep the soil moist, tho wet, and the plants in a good growing condition. Brussels sprouts do not keep well in storage and for that reason only enough should be grown for summer consumption. CABBAGE. iOf the early cabbage varieties. Early Wakefleld, Winningstadt Early Flathead were grown. Of the late types, Danish Ball, ch Flathead, Drumhead, and Twentieth Century were tried, to earliness and quality there was practically no difference veen the first two mentioned early varieties. The Early Flat- I was as early and of equally good quality, but as soon as the Is became very solid they would burst. Danish Ball Head red the best of the late varieties. It is not nearly so large he other varieties grown, but the leaves and ribs are of much p texture and it does not burst «o easily when mature. Neither : subject to the common fault of having a looee, soft center. The seeding and culture of cabbage are the same as for Brus - sels sprouts, except that as the heads begin to mature irrigation should be discontinued, unless the individual heads are harvested aa soon as they attain a good size and are firm. For storage, the heads are cut off just above the ground with a corn or beet knife. It is well to trim off some but not all of the lower leaves. The headH may then be piled up in a cellar. If there is no cellar space, the heads should be pulled and placed in a trench. The depth of the trench should equal the diameter of the largest cab - bage heads and the width should be about three times this. Six inches of straw should be placed on top of the cabbage and suffi - cient soil thrown on to hold the straw. As cold weather comes on, more soil should be added to prevent freezing. A ridge space should be left open along the top for ventilation. When very cold weather sets in and about six inches of soil is on the pit, the soil having been frozen about four inches deep, a board is placed along the straw ridge and the entire pit is covered with about one foot of coarse manure. </seg>
            <seg id="p016">Verifiable Gardens on Irrigated Farms in Wetter* Xebraska 16 CAULIFLOWER. I 'he varieties of cauliflower grown were Early Erfurt. Rarljf tfball, and Drouth Resistant. The choice of varieties is in order given. The Erfurt seemed to make a smoother head did not produce as many seed stalks as the Drouth Resistant. I For an early crop the plants should be seeded in boxes or a bed and handled the same as cabbage. The plants when once out and started should not be irrigated much. In fact, it is ter to have the soil a little too dry than too wet. When the Is begin to appear, a good irrigation should be given and there - ?r the plants should not be allowed to suffer for water. Soon ?r the head appears, all the leaves about the plant should be wn carefully together at the top and tied with a rag string, e being taken to exclude all light from the head. This blearh - will give a white head that is lender and of better flavor than se grown in the open. Cauliflower cannot be stored and kept winter use. CARROTS. Three varieties of carrots were tested — the Oxheart. Chaste nay. and Denver Half Long. The Oxheart at no time becan ettiw :is the other two varieties. All root crops, however, will become woody toward the end of the season, and for this reftMM a second planting should be made nltout six weeks after the first. The first seed should be planted the first week in May. in rows twenty inches apart. The plants may stand an inch apart in the rows. As they begin to crowd, they can be thinned out ;is the vegetable is used. The plants should be irrigated so as r&lt;&gt; he kept in a good growing condition. A dry soil will make a stringy, hard carrot. For winter use. the carrots are pulled after the first hard frost. The tops are cut off and the carrots are piled in a good cool cellar. If this cannot be done, they may be placed in a pile and covered in the same way as has been described for cabbages. SWISS CHARD. t Swiss chard is but little known to most farmers. The leaves v be eaten as greens, or the midrib of the leaves may be cooked I creamed the same as celery. This plant is worth a trial in garden. The seed should be planted about the first week in May in rows twenty-two inches apart. When thinned out the young plants may be used as greens, allowing the regular crop to stand nliout twelve inches apart in the row. It is well to irrigate so </seg>

The varieties of celery grown were: Golden Heart, Giant Pascal, and Self-Blanching. The last two made a larger and better growth than did the Golden Heart. The Golden Heart appeared to branch too much and caused trouble when bunched for blanching. The seed should be sown in a hotbed or cold frame about the last week in April. When the plants are about two inches high they should be set out in a bed or in rows three to four inches apart. When they have attained a height of four or five inches they are set out in the garden in rows forty inches apart and about ten inches in the row. Usually about the middle of Au - gust the plants are of suitable size to begin the blanching. This may be done either by ridging soil about the plants or by the much simpler process of placing boards along each side of the row as close as possible to the plants. If boards are used for blanching, the space between the plants should not be more than live inches. Celery should be liberally irrigated. There is no danger of giving it too much water. After the first real cold weather, the plants should lie taken up by the roots and placed in a trench about one foot wide, standing the plants as closely as possible without undue crowding. Straw is placed on the plants when the trench is full. From this point the procedure is the same as given for cabbage. ICeleriac is a turnip rooted celery. The root is large and hy and this is eaten instead of the stalk. The seed is sown in garden after danger of frost is past. Planting should be How. in rows twenty inches apart, allowing the plants to ad about six inches apart in the rows. The roots require king. They may be eaten creamed or made into a salad. SWEET CORN. The early sweet corn varieties were Peep o' Day, Golden Ban - tam, and Catawba. In earliness, these varieties ranked in the order named. There is but little difference in the earliness of Golden Bantam and Peep o' Day. The Peep o' Day has been dis - carded on account of its short ears and very shallow grain. For late sweet corn, the choice for table use is as follows: Country Gentleman. Crosby Early, Gold Medal, and Stowell's Evergreen. The Country Gentleman has very deep, uneven towb. </seg>
            <seg id="p018">18 Vegetable Gardens on Irrigated Farms in Western Nebraska Some object to the uneven rows, but the quality of the corn more than offsets this feature. A few rows of early sweet corn should be planted during the first days of May. It is best to plant in rows forty inches apart, with plants twelve to fifteen inches apart in the rows. Planting should be thick and the plants should be thinned out when they are well up. In case of severe cold after the corn is up it is desirable for protection to draw a little soil onto the plants with a hoe. If this is left a day or two it will not do any damage. The soil can be removed with a hoe, but care should be taken not to catch the earth too deep and tear off the plants. For the main crop, the corn should be planted about the middle of May. Altho the planting of an early and a late variety will give a succession of good corn the greater part of the season, it is well to plant some early corn the first week in July. This as a rule insures good table ears until frost. Elxcessive irrigation of corn when young will produce an dance of leaf growth and very late corn. Irrigation should eferred as long as possible. It is better to under-irrigate to overirrigate for early corn. CUCUMBERS. KThornburn's Everbearing, White Spine, and Long Green were varieties of cucumbers grown. The first named is preferred, n tho it is much smaller than the others. It bears abnn - tly and furnishes very good pickling stock. It ripens also ly a week earlier than the others. Cucumbers are easily grown. They are planted in the garden after danger of frost is over. Instead of planting cucumbers in hills, it is good practice to plant them in a continuous row. When the plants have grown about four leaves, they are of suit - able size for thinning. The smaller plants should then be pulled, those remaining being left to stand about six inches apart in the row. As soon as the plants bloom, those that have no flowers or buds should be removed, leaving the remaining plants about one foot to eighteen inches apart in the row. The first flowers never bear fruit ; they are male flowers. In about one week the female, or fruit flowers, appear. At this time the final thinning is made and all plants with female flowers are allowed to stand. This process may seem tedious, but it insures fruit from one to two weeks earlier than the hill method. I The cucumbers should be irrigated sparingly until after the it begins to set; from then on the soil should be kept in good ist condition. </seg>
            <seg id="p019">Vegetable Gardens on Irrigated Farms in Western Nebraska 19 EGGPLANT. Only two varieties of eggplant were grown — the Early Long Purple and the White. The latter variety is very late and did nothing more than flower and barely set fruit when the frost killed it. The Early Long Purple produced a large amount of fruit. A dozen plants are sufficient for a good-sized family. The plants are grown in boxes or hotbed the same as cabbage and set out after danger of frost is over. They are planted eighteen inches apart in rows thirty inches apart, and are irrigated the same as cucumbers. KOHI.-RABI. I This is a vegetable very much like a turnip, except that the We portion develops above the ground. The seed is planted May in the open ground, in rows twenty inches apart. The nts are thinned to two inches in the row. IKohl-rabi is very easily grown and should be tried by those j are fond of turnips. For table use it may be prepared the le as turnips. It is irrigated so as to keep the plants in a d growing condition from the time growth begins. LETTUCE. Iceberg, Silver Ball, May King, and Early Simpson were the lettuce varieties grown. There is but little difference in the many varieties except in the loose and solid head. For a real delicacy, the head lettuce is preferred. The chief objections made to the head lettuce is that it heads too late. This may be par - tially overcome by seeding it rather heavily about the last week in April. As soon as it is large enough to eat, thinning should begin and continue as the plants are used. After the first thin - ning, individual plants should stand about five inches apart in the row. After this it is well to go over the row and begin using the alternate plants. At about mid-season, large heads will be ready for use. Lettuce is seeded in rows twenty inches apart. The soil should be well stirred and kept moist enough to keep the plants in a good growing condition. Lettuce that grows ■lowly is inclined to be tough and very bitter. ONIONS. Eellow Danvers, Southport Red. Prize Takers, and Gibraltar grown for large onions, and Bermudas for pickling. The two are good keepers; the second two cannot be kept for length of time, but are good cooking onions on acconnt of mild flavor. </seg>
            <seg id="p020">Onions may be grown from seed or sets. The first method is the cheaper and gives as good result as sets. The plants should stand two or three inches apart in the row. The soil should be kept moist, but not wet, so the onions will remain in growing condition. If the tops begin to break down in the late summer, water should be kept off, so as to allow the onions to mature. Should they fail to break down, water should be kept off and the tops broken down about two or three weeks before the crop is to be harvested. The breaking of these will cause the onion to mature, especially if the soil is dry. When the tops are fairly dry the onions are pulled and left in rows for several days until they are well dried down. The tops are then removed and the onions stored in a cool, dry place for winter use. PARSNIPS. I Parsnips are easily grown. They are seeded in the spring in about twenty inches apart. The plants are thinned to stand m three to four inches apart in the row. Sufficient water is &gt;lied to keep them in good growing condition, but not enough force them. Roots that are too large usually become woody, renips are best for table use in the fall after the first freeze, fore the ground freezes solid, the parsnips should be dug and red in a cellar or pit for winter use, as suggested for carrots. PEAS. The collection of peas to choose from is large. Careful selec - tion is necessary if disappointing results are to be avoided. For early peas. American Wonder, Extra Early, Premium Gem, Xott's Excelsior, and British Wonder were grown. The first two have been discarded as total failures under local conditions. The last three named varieties are good and are preferred even tho they nre not particularly early. British Wonder has a strong, sturdy stem and does not whip about badly in windstorms. The late peas tried rank as follows: Duke of Albany, Telephone, and Marrowfat. The Edible Pod variety is more of a novelty and is not worth planting in the farm garden. As late planted peas do not thrive well, it is best to plant the early varieties as early as possible; that is. during April. About the first week in May both the mid-season and the late ones should be planted. This will give a succession of this vegetable thruout the season. About the middle of July it is well to plant more early peas, and these will generally give good pods before freezing. Peas are planted in rows twenty-four inches apart, with plants about three to four inches apart in the row. The care and culture should be the same as for beans. </seg>
            <seg id="p021">PEANUTS. Altho peanuts are not commonly considered as a garden vege - table, they find a place in the farmer's garden. The season in western Nebraska is rather short for this plant and the fruit does not mature in abundance, but with a little care some fruit may be secured. The small Spanish peanut is the only variety that has been successfully grown. It is planted early in the spring, after danger of frost is over. Planting is done in hills about ten to twelve inches apart in the row. It is best to irrigate but little. If the soil is very moist when the nuts are planted, they may not require another irrigation during the season. They are more likely to make a crop on dry land than under irrigation. After the first hard frost it is well to pull the plants and bunch them where they may cure in the sun. When the pods are thoroly dry, they are picked and spread out several inches deep on a floor. Whon the shells become dry and brittle the peanuts should be put into sacks or barrels, where they may be kept until used. PEPPER. |)f the peppers, Ruby King and Bull Nose were the only two ra, and there is but little difference between the two. The its should be grown in boxes in the house or in a hotbed, so they may be of good size when the season opens. The plants ild be about four to five inches high when set out in spring r danger of frost is over. Planting is done in rows thirty es apart with the plants eighteen inches apart in the row. It ell to irrigate sparingly until fruit begins to set and then to ;ate somewhat more liberally. Care should always be taken, ever, not to apply too much water. As a rule, a few plants produce all the peppers that will be consumed by the average 1 family. POTATOES. As a rule, potatoes are grown to better advantage in a field under field conditions than in a garden. The short rows of the garden are difficult to work on account of the ditching required for irrigation. I A few rows may be planted in the garden, however, and thus are some early potatoes until those in the field are ready for . The Quick Lunch or Norton's Beauty, Early Ohio, and ?eka are the best varieties to plant for this purpose. ■About the first of April, provide some shallow boxes or trays, ce in these the potatoes that are to be planted, standing the </seg>

Care should be taken that the ts do not become too large or watery. Irhe last week in April, plant these sprouted potatoes, cutting q in such a manner that one or two good sprouts will stand taking care not to break off the sprouts. Ee rows for planting need not be more than thirty-six inches and the hills about one foot. Make these rows with a plow or a hoe and deep enough to place the cut tuber three below the surface. Cover the rows with a rake. Efhen the potatoes are hoed, or cultivated, always throw the against plants. In this manner much of the ditching is done out having to do the work with a ditcher. Keep the plants good growing condition. Potatoes kept too wet will make ge amount of foliage and will not set tubers. RHUBARB. Ehubarb should be grown in every garden. It is easy of cul - is the earliest vegetable of the season, and is one of the wholesome grown. I Plants may be secured either in the fall, about September, or ly in the spring before growth begins. Small cuttings of the ts may be set out. provided there is a bud on the root cutting. &gt;se are planted so that the bud is about two or three inches rw the surface of the soil. As this plant is a perennial, it uld be set out in one end of the garden with the other per - nent plantings. If more than a row is planted, it is well to e the rows forty-eight inches apart. The plants should be ee feet apart in the row. As the plants begin to age it is best take up a portion of the old plants, divide them into small tings and start a new planting. Old plants will often have id centers or a portion near the edge will decay. Division need : be made until this takes place. The plants should be well nured and not allowed to get too dry. A rich soil and plenty moisture favor the production of large, tender stalks. RUTABAGA. Rutabagas are ordinarily seeded early in spring. Their cul - ture is the same as that given kohlrabi. For winter use it is well to plant some of the seed about the first week in July. This will give small, tender roots for winter use. These may be harvested after the first hard frost and stored in the cellar or pit the same as carrots. </seg>
            <seg id="p023">Vegetable Gardens on Irrigated Farms in Western Nebraska 23 SALSIFY Salsify is but little grown by the farmer, but it deserves a place in the farm garden. The root is eaten in the late summer. After the first severe frost the roots may be harvested and stored the same as carrots. The culture for salsify is the same as that for carrots. SPINACH. I Victoria. I&gt;routh Resistant, and Savoy-leaved were tried, toria grew the best and produced the tenderest leaf. Spinach ilanted early in Hay in rows twenty inches apart. The plants thinned out as used. It is best to make only a small seed - of spinach at a time and to plant every two or three weeks. s will insure good, tender leaves. When the plants are old leaves are tough and have a poor flavor. The crop should be gated so as to keep the soil moist and the plants in a good wing condition thruout the growing period. Slow growth, to lack of moisture, produces undesirable leaves. Spinach is ily canned for winter use. This is the only manner in which lay be kept. SQUASH The variety of squash to grow depends principally on indi - vidual taste. Any of the numerous kinds will thrive and pro - duce an abundance of squash. For summer squash those tried are ranked as follows: Fordhook, White Bush, Scalloped, and Golden Orookneck. For winter squash the varieties tried rank: Sweet Potato, Synne's Blue. Golden Hubbard, and Hubbard. Altho assertions are made that some of the summer squash may be kept over for winter use, this was not found possible at the Ex - periment Farm. Even the Sweet Potato squash does not keep as well as the Hnbbard for winter use. Care should be taken not to overirrigate the squash, as there is a tendency for it to pro - duce vines rather than fruit. If several varieties are grown in garden, it is necessary to secure new seed each year, as the plants mix easily. The summer squash are planted in rows five feet apart, with the plants three to four feet apart in the row. The culture of squash is the same as that given for cumbers. SWEET POTATOES. B'he Bermuda sweet potatoes were tried for two years, and, small potatoes formed, very few attained sufficient size for ? use. The yield secured does not justify the culture unless ich earlier variety than the Bermuda is secured. </seg>
            <seg id="p024">24 Ynjrtable Gardens on Irrigated Farms in Western Xebraska TOMATOES. A large number of tomato varieties were grown each year. The Earliana, Yakima. Sparks' Earliana, and Chalk's Early proved to be the mo.-u dependable. There is but little difference in the varieties mentioned so far as yielding qualities are con - cerned. The seasons are too short for such varieties as Match - less. Ponderosa. button's, and Beauty. The Dwarf Stone was tried, as on account of its low. stocky growth the wind would not be able to whip it about, but this variety proved too late for the I The plants should be grown in boxes or hotbed and set out ;r danger of frost. If the soil is moist when the plants are set and they start off well, they should not be irrigated until they in to show signs of suffering. At no time should they be gated heavily so that the soil is made very moist. The many ures to secure a good full crop of this fruit are more often ■ to overirrigation than to anything else. After the first hard st that has shriveled the leaves, all fruit that is beginning to n color, and some of the green fruit, should be picked. These uld be placed on a shelf in the cellar, but not piled up. (dually they will begin to ripen. In this manner good fresh it may be kept on hand for about six weeks after the first WATERMELONS AND CANTALOUPS. AYaterniplons and cantaloups grow very easily and in abun - dance. Only parly varieties should be used. Altho it may be pos - sible to secure fruit some years from the late varieties. they are not at all dependable. For parly maturing watermelons. Ford - hook Early has proved very satisfactory. Cole's Early does well, but is not so well flavored. For later watermelons, nothing else equaled Kleckley Sweet. Tn cantaloups the order of maturity is: Jenny T.ind. Nutmeg. Rocky Ford, and Burrell Gem. Many are disappointed with the Jenny T.ind on account of its small sizi\ but being an early cantaloup of delicious flavor it is very desir - alilp for tlip garden. As cantaloups mix very easily, new seed should be secured each year. The culture of these is the same as that given for cucumbers, except that they should have less mois - ture in order to obtain an abundance of good fruit. After the first frost it is well to place all of the partially ripe melons in a cellar, where they will ripen and keep in good condition from three to four weeks. </seg>
