            <seg id="p010">10 REPORT OF SECRETARY RECOMMENDATION The accomplishments during the past two years covered by this report, during which time 32 miles have been paved, 1601 miles gravel surfaced, 1074 miles graded and 186 bridges built, show very satisfactory results considering the amount of money expended. Generally speaking a continuance of the present financial program and also of the policies of administration of this Department are recommended. With the very diversified conditions prevalent in Nebraska and with the constantly increasing traffic, it is thought that at least $50,000.00 per year should be expended for experimental purposes. Because of the dust nuisance and the difficulty of main - tenance on the heaviest traffic roads on a comparatively small mileage near population centers where traffic from several lines of highway converge onto a single line, some thought should be given to the most efficient type of surface treatment which can be had at the lowest cost. While some of the fundamental practice established by ex - perience of other states can be used to advantage in this state, differ - ence of conditions, both as to soil, rainfall, traffic and construction materials makes it necessary that each state work out its own problems according to its own conditions. Because of the large mileage of low type surface (such as gravel) which we are building, the continuation of a strong maintenance organization adequately financed as at present is particularly nec - essary. Attention is called to the fact that this department is function - ing at a very low overhead cost. The total expense of general administration of this department which includes all expenditures for general supervision, preliminary survey and preparation of plans, in fact all expense except actual inspection of work on the job is about 2%. I do not know of any state which is equalling this record. I recommend that 2% of all finances coming to this department for expenditure be made available for general administration. Respectfully submitted, R. L. COCHRAN, State Engineer. November 30, 1926. </seg>
            <seg id="p011">DEPARTMENT OP PUBLIC WORKS U Mr. R. L. Cochran, November 30, 1926. Secretary and State Engineer, Department of Public Works, State of Nebraska, Lincoln. Sir: I have the honor and pleasure of submitting to you the Biennial Report of the Bureau of Roads and Bridges covering the two year period ending November 30, 1926. Owing to the magnitude of any State-Federal Aid Highway program it is only possible in such a re - port to present briefly the salient activities and accomplishments. All tabulations, charts, photographs, and discussions have been correlated, and consolidated under the Divisions most closely allied to the various subjects in a manner very similar to our previous re - port. These Divisions are functioning smoothly and efficiently under the system we established formerly which provided for the following consolidations: Division of Location, Construction and Maintenance; Division of Tests; Division of Design, Maps and Plans; Division of Accounts and Records. The people of Nebraska are well aware that the highway program and results obtained in this Biennium are but little less than that for all previous years combined since the acceptance of Federal Aid in 1917 but they are not aware of the strained efforts of our employees behind the scenes who made your dreams a reality. The Bureau takes far more pride in pointing to these splendid efforts and sacrifices than in chronicling the actual achievements upon the highways. The greater part of the office Engineering and Clerical personnel returned to these offices to work about 3 hours each night from two to six weeks preceeding each of our six large highway lettings. This extra time was given by the employees without encouragement by this Bureau and with their full knowledge that they would receive no extra pay for overtime and in many instances no credit for over - time. Our field engineers have been equally industrious. This loyalty and service to you, the Governor and the State is fully recognized but is not recorded elsewhere in this report although it is strongly evi - denced by the remarkably low cost of administration. Although the Bureau is proud of its personnel, its record of ac - complishments, its respect by the county officials and contractors rep - resented by the splendid harmony and cooperation obtained, its con - fidence of the general public as indicated through lack of adverse criticism by the press and also its general improvement over previous bienniums, yet it is not satisfied and is of the firm belief and hopes that the next Biennial Report will register still greater successes. Accepting this thought it is believed that this report will meet with your approval and is therefore Respectfully submitted. (Signed) M. C. NOBLE, Chief. Bureau of Roads and Bridges. </seg>

            <seg id="p013">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS ORGANIZATION, LAWS AND DISCUSSIONS To better appreciate the functioning of this Bureau and to under - stand clearly the discussions and tabulations following in this report, particularly with references to State-Federal Aid construction, it appears advisable to outline briefly the Department organization, also a few of the outstanding highway laws, governing policies, and types of construction caused by the demand for economy and use of materials at hand. Brief mention is also made of the history of the state particularly with reference to those historical spots which the autoist may easily reach from the State Highway System. ORGANIZATION OF HIGHWAY DEPARTMENT Previous to the Legislative Session of 1919, the highway depart - ment was under the State Board of Irrigation, Highways and Drain - age. This Board consisted of three members, the Governor acting as President, the Attorney General, and the Commissioner of Public Lands and Buildings. This Board appointed a State Engineer who became the active responsible head of the State Irrigation, Highways and Drainage. The State Engineer, with approval of the Board, ap - pointed a deputy, or assistant State Engineering in charge of the highway work. The 1919 Legislature adopted the Civil Administrative Code Bill which has been the law in force since that time. Under the Code, the State Board of Irrigation, Highways and Drainage was abolished and in its place was created the present Department of Public Works. The Governor who is the head appoints the Secretary-State Engineer as the active head of the Department of Public Works. The State Engineer with the Governor's approval appoints an Assistant as Chief of the Bureau of Roads and Bridges. The Code does not define the officers and their duties below the State Engineer so the organization is developed and responsibility placed as directed by the Chief of the Bureau and State Engineer. The organization chart as shown on page four explains the lines of responsibility for this Bureau as established by the Chief and State Engineer. This plan of organiza - tion is far more condensed and compaot than the usual highway organization plan with a corresponding resultant reduction in the number of higher salaried office heads and requiring likewise greater responsibility on the part of each head. HIGHWAY SYSTEM ESTABLISHED The original Federal Aid Highway Act was approved July 11, 1916. Following the acceptance of Federal Aid as covered by this Act by the Legislature of 1917, the County Board of Supervisors and Com- </seg>
            <seg id="p014">14 REPORT OF SECRETARY E oners designated a program of roads upon which they desired -Federal Aid participation. This system was approved by the Engineer. Later the 1919 Legislature established this system rising approximately 5000 miles under eighty-eight route numbers I the Nebraska State Highway System with the provision that as er roads were constructed with State and Federal Aid funds such structed roads would become a part of the State Highways. In ition to the statutory system as originally outlined by the County trds, the law also provided (hat the Counties establish a system ; ounty roads not exceeding twenty per cent of the total mileage he County, which system is under the jurisdiction of the County This system of State Highways as established by the County Boards, this department and the 1919 Legislature is primarily a farm to market system of roads. No connected system of roads could be established which would better serve as farm to market roads within the same allowable mileage. At the same time these roads include the important inter-county roads and inter-state roads. The amended Federal Highway Act approved Nov. 9, 1921 delegated authority to the United States Secretary of Agriculture to approve a system of highways know as the Seven Per Cent System. Each State was required to submit a map showing the Seven Per Cent System as desired, which map was to be approved by the Secre - tary of Agriculture as submitted or as modified under the Secretary's suggestion. The mileage of highways in this Seven Per Cent System, for any State, cannot exceed seven per cent of the total road mileage In the state as certified under the original highway act. Nebraska's certified mileage at that time was 80,272 miles, which permits the Seven Per Cent System to contain 5,619 miles. A careful check of all highway mileage in Nebraska was completed in 1923 and the mileage found to be 94,633. The maps on file with the Federal Bureau show this Seven Per Cent mileage in Nebraska to be entirely exhausted so the Nebraska highways which may receive State-Federal Aid funds are definitely established until the system is constructed in its entirety at which time additions may be made. Since Federal funds cannot be expended on highways outside the seven per cent system and since our state road legislative appropria - tions, are made to meet Federal Aid appropriations, it was the present administration's desire to increase the allowable mileage up to Seven Per Cent of 94,633, the correct mileage for the State, in order to incorporate several very important inter-county and interstate highways in this system. The request to the Federal Bureau was disapproved on the basis that the Federal Highway Act </seg>
            <seg id="p015">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 15 particularly specified that the mileage as certified by the State under the original act was to govern. FEDERAL AID APPROPRIATIONS AND LAWS Federal Aid appropriations are made from the General Funds of the United States Treasury. Distribution to the states is made upon the ratio that the state bears to the total of all Sates in the following three ways, area of States, population of State, and miles of mail route. In this manner the eastern states which contribute heavily to the Federal taxes do not receive a proportionately heavy return for roads while the western states profit accordingly. For example Nebraska receives $4.15 for Federal Aid roads for each dollar of Federal taxes paid for roads in this state. This is not so much to the advantage of the western states as these figures would indicate because many of the Federal taxes paid by the Eastern States is based upon property or products in Nebraska. For example, Federal taxes on some railroads, and many articles of consumption in this state are paid through headquarters offices located in the east and thus credited where paid. The Federal Bureau participates up to fifty per cent of the con - struction and engineering costs of a project except the engineering costs necessary on preliminary surveys, preparation of plans and estimates, and administration. The maximum Federal Aid available per mile has varied from $10,000.00 to $20,000.00 exclusive of bridges over 20 feet clear span as noted below. Federal funds may participate on construction through cities under 2500 population, and in larger cities these funds may be expended on that portion of the road along which the houses do not average more than 200 feet apart. All construction supervision and engineering and all main - tenance must be done by the State under a State Highway Depart - ment. The County Boards make formal application to this Depart - ment for State-Federal Aid funds specifying the highways upon which expenditure is to be made before any plans are made for contracting. Previous to November 9, 1926, the County Boards and this department awarded contracts jointly but the 1925 Legislature created a statute providing that after Nov. 9, 1926, the Department of Public Works alone shall let all contracts on State-Federal Aid construction.

            <seg id="p016">In addition to the above appropriations the House and Senate passed the Dowell Bill (H. R. 9504) carrying $75,000,000 for each of the years 1928 and 1929, under respective dates of April 16, 1926 and June 11, 1926. From these appropriations Nebraska will be allotted approximately $1,588,000 during each year of the coming biennium ending June 30, 1929. STATE AID APPROPRIATION AND DISTRIBUTION I Nebraska lacks progressive legislation which will permit the De - tment to plan a program ot definite expenditures in advance. It legislative appropriation is made for one biennium so that once :i two years, the Department must wait several months before the gram for the biennium can be established, surveys made and plans roved. This generally throws a large highway letting in late mid - imer when fewest contractors are free to bid. The following appropriations to meet Federal Aid have been made by the past state legislatures. State Appropriations Tears Covered Amount The above funds except gas tax were raised by direct property tax. Collections on property tax were made by the counties and trans - mitted to the State Treasurer. Gas tax collections are made by the Department of Agriculture and transmitted to the State Treasurer. The Legislative' estimate of gas funds to meet Federal Aid was low as an estimate placed today would be slightly in excess of $4,500,000. The funds used to meet Federal Aid are credited back to the counties in the same manner as Federal Aid is distributed to the States that is under the ratio that each county bears to the State in the follow - ing three ways, area, population and miles of mail route. The ratio relative to population is determined by the number of votes cast for Governor at the General election, 1916. The following chart shows the ratio or percentage of each ap - propriation credited to the county based upon population, miles of mail route and area.

This tax is estimated to raise about three million dollars annually of which about two million may be used to meet Federal Aid and one million used in conjunction with the 30% of Motor Vehicle license tax collections for highway main- tenance purposes. What was the property road tax in Nebraska as viewed by the tell the general tax payer who paid the bills? The following facts story: </seg>
            <seg id="p019">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS Assessed valuation all property in Nebraska 1923 $3,198,632,992 Road tax on 1-4 section land to raise $1,000,000 ....$ 1.92 The above taxes met a like amount of Federal Aid, so, previous to the Gas Tax law in Nebraska, to raise $2,000,000 State Federal Aid funds in one year the average 1-4 section of land paid $1.92 of the "well to do" taxpayers whose property was actually assessed at $10,000 (meaning it was actually worth considerably more) paid $3.12 state road tax for construction. This tax was paid alike by city and rural property but practically all funds were expended on rural roads. Let us see what has happened since the gas tax law was enacted. From close estimates it is apparent that the rural district raise 30% and the cities 70% of the gas tax yet practically all is expended on rural roads. The average Nebraska car uses about one gallon of gas to 13 miles. A tax of 2c per gallon means that the average car pays about 15c gas tax for 100 miles of driving. Compare this 15c good road tax expended for driving over a good road with the bad road tax due to additional wear and tear and lost time to make the same drive over an unimproved road. Further if $3,000,000 is to be collected annually on gas consumed in approximately 350,000 motor vehicles registered in Nebraska in 1926 it means an average tax per vehicle of about $8.57 per year. In addition to the $1,500,000 appropriated by tbe Legislature ot 1923, which was insufficient by over two million dollars to meet the Federal fund available, the same Legislature authorized the counties to meet as much of the surplus Federal Aid, through tbe State De - partment, as was available for their county. As a result in addition to the regular road tax the counties in the year 1923 raised $429,992 and in the year of 1924 they raised $572,746 to meet Federal Aid whereas in the previous three bienniums or six years all the local or county funds raised totalled only $513,853.00. In 1925 local funds to the extent of $409,704 were used and in 1926 $296, 73S were raised to meet Federal Aid. A most unfortunate condition arises in a few of the western counties under the present State-Federal Aid laws or rather under present lack of a surplus of State funds over that needed to meet available Federal Aid funds. In these particular counties traffic is very light and standard highway construction is very expensive on tate levy necessary to raise $1,000,000 Load tax on each $1,000 assessed valuation Load tax on each $10,000 assessed valuation $ .verage assessed valuation per acre ot land $ Load tax per acre to raise $1,000,000 .312 Mill 31.2 Cent 3.12 38.44 1.2 Cent </seg>
            <seg id="p020">REPORT OF SECRETARY account of sand soil. So state funds should be free to use, Independent of Federal Aid funds in order that the occasional bad spots in the sand hill trails could be improved and many miles of additional highways made useable rather than following federal requirements in the construction of a short span of high type sand clay road. Such Federal Aid construction means very little progress can be made with the meager funds available consequently the improve - ment is of very little service to the public. These counties would benefit greatly if state funds in excess of those appropriated to meet Federal Aid were available so that strictly State Aid funds could be used at least in counties under 4000 population. The following tabulation indicates the expenditures made for state highway construction since the acceptance of Federal Aid in State Federal Other Funds Total The above expenditures are inclusive of special appropriations made for special purposes and listed in detail later in this report such as, State Institution Paving or graveling and State Aid Bridges. State Institution Paving appropriation is applicable for fifty per cent of the excess costs over the special benefits assessed provided the Institution making application to this Department is located more than one-half mile and not exceeding three miles from a rail - road unloading track or permanent highway leading to the railroad unloading track. The Legislature of 1925 extended the possibility for state Institution paving to cover any highway used to connect the Institution with the termini of any street within the corporate limits of a city of the second class and authorizes the Board of Control to sign petitions in the name of the state for such improvement 246,263.60 1,463,650.10 2,070,112.33 1,260,660.11 796,408.18 50,782.47 1,494,775.85 2,077,417.06 2,786,792.74 277,232.03 1,453,602.48 1,357,099.84 1,370,038.07 846,715.77 404,036.64 1,952,055.36 2,219,500.83 2,675,723.08 182,295.89 236,015.42 56,866.26 219,437.13 81,280.31 429,992.39 572,746.86 409,704.14 296,738.27 705,791.52 3,153,268.00 3,484,078.43 2,850,135.31 1,724,404.26 884,811.50 4,019,578.07 4,706,622.03 5,759,254.09 Totals . . 12,246,862.44 12,556,004.10 2,485,076.67 27,287,943.21 </seg>
            <seg id="p021">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS State Institution graveling is a special appropriaation made by the 1925 Legislature. This appropriation authorizes the Department to gravel highways connecting State Institutions with State Highways when such State Institutions are not on State Highways and where the distance does not exceed eight miles. This same authorization limits the annual expenditure for this purpose to $25,000 same to be taken from the 2c gas tax. A separate appropriation of $1650 to be raised by property levy was made by this 1925 Legislature for the purpose of graveling 33rd Street, Lincoln from Holdrege Street North along the west side of the Agricultural College. The State Aid Bridge Appropriation is made by each Legislature usually in the sum of $200,000 to be used anywhere in the state to assist the counties in the construction of the larger bridges. These funds need not be expended on the State-Federal Aid system but in the event that they are so expended they may be used in conjunction with Federal Aid funds. Any county may make application for one - half the cost of any bridge spanning a stream the width of 100 fee or more. Application may be made by either county on a county line bridge and if approved by this Department the structure may be built and one-fourth cost collected from each county. In the even of a dispute between two counties on the location of such a bridge, the State Engineer may cast the deciding vote. Counties expending over $100.00 in any one year on State Aid Bridge repairs under the direction of the State Engineer may be reimbursed for one-half the cost of repairs from the State Aid Bridge fund. The cost of administration including the preparation of plans, specifications and estimates, preliminary surveys, equipment, supplies and other miscellaneous office expense is about 1.66% of all con - struction expenditures as shown by the following chart. This cost of administration is among the lowest, if not the lowest of any state highway administration cost in the U. S. and the contract price obtained as shown by the chart following is in line with the lowest prices received for comparable work in the United States. </seg>

            <seg id="p025">24 OTHER HIGHWAY LAWS A few of the highway laws which affect State and Federal Aid construction are mentioned here very briefly. Contracts — Construction work involving State-Federal Aid Road funds must be advertised in the official county paper for three con - secutive issues not less than twenty days. Such notice must state that the plans and specifications may be inspected at the office of the County Clerk and Department of Public Works and must also state the date and hour when the receiving of the bids shall close, at which time they must be publicly opened before any bidders or their representatives. The details of a typical highway letting are related later in this report. State Aid bridge notices must be advertised four consecutive weeks. On all state-federal aid construction previous to November 9, 1926, I contracts were signed jointly by the County and State. Since ember 9, the Department alone is required to award contracts. Btrictly county bridge construction the law requires the advertise - t to run four consecutive weeks and be based upon plans and :ifications prepared by the Department of Public Works. The ities must advertise all bridge work estimated to cost over $500 may let annual contracts covering all work for the year or if bids rejected the counties may purchase material and employ labor for construction and repair of all bridges for the year. All bridges t be painted white above the floor system for at least twenty feet t Maintenance — Previous to January 1, 1926, all maintenance funds e derived from the motor vehicle license tax. The collections e made by each county on vehicles within that county. All funds ained in the county where collected except three and one-half per t which was transmitted to the State General Fund a portion of ch if appropriated was used for motor vehicle and state highway ntenance administrative purposes. Once a year a representative of the Department of Public Works with the assistance of the County Board prepared a maintenance budget listing the funds needed for the maintenance of State High - ways in each county. This budget was certified to the County Treas - urer who set aside from the motor vehicle license collections the amount of funds shown by the budget providing such amount did not exceed seventy-five per cent of the Motor Vehicle taxes collected. The balance of the Motor Vehicle collections not taken in the budget or in the three and one-half per cent transmitted to the state or not otherwise taken was credited to the county road dragging fund. </seg>
            <seg id="p026">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 25 When the county adequately maintained the state system to the satisfaction of the Department they were reimbursed the actual cost of such maintenance by claims upon the State Highway Fund ap - proved by this Department. If the maintenance was not satisfactory the Department could upon thirty days written notice take over com - plete control of such maintenance and pay all costs from the State Highway Fund of said county. This has never been done although several warnings had to be issued to improve the maintenance. The maintenance of the state system in each county was directly under a County Highway Commissioner who was appointed each year by the County Board of Commissioners or Supervisors. The county board could appoint as County Highway Commissioner one of their own members or anyone else regardless of residence. Invariably the class of maintenance reflected directly the ability of the Highway Com - missioner and his degree of cooperation with the State Department and county lines were easily distinguishable by the difference in main - tenance between two counties. Joint responsibility by the state and counties for the maintenance made it possible for either party to attempt at least to pass responsibility for unsatisfactory maintenance to the other party. In order to wipe out county lines, produce uniform maintenance, place responsibility in a single head, and to conform to the Federal requirements the 1925 Legislature created a statute providing that after January 1, 1926 the Department of Public Works would main - tain the whole of the State Highway System, excepting those portions lying within Incorporated limits of cities or villages having a popula - tion more than 1400 people. This same statute further provides that after January 1, 1926 the County Treasurers shall transmit 30% of all motor vehicle registration collections to the State Treasurer to be placed in the State Highway Fund out of which state Highway Maintenance costs shall be paid. In addition to this 30% the Gas Tax law permits the use of as much of the gas tax collection for maintenance as is needed. Taking over this maintenance by this department increased the number of employees in the Department about four fold over night, although a small actual reduction in the total number of state high - way maintenance employees was made. This reduction was due to the elimination of about ninety County Highway Commissioners from the State Highway System and the substitution of about 60 Chief Patrolmen in charge of one to three counties each. Some of these chief patrolmen were former county highway commissioners and some were Resident Engineers who added the maintenance duties to their previous duties as state construction Engineers and this again reduced the overhead administration costs. By adding a stenographer or maintenance clerk in each of the eight district offices and two clerks </seg>
            <seg id="p027">26 REPORT OF SECRETARY in the Lincoln office this great increase in clerical work formerly handled by the ninety-three counties was absorbed very smoothly. If there is an adverse criticism to the functioning of this new section of the department organization it can only be with reference to the possibile slow payments of some employees salaries or maintenance supplies nearly all of which can be charged to the number of offices through which each claim must pass before payment after leaving this department. Motor Vehicles — Motor vehicles include motorcycles, and all vehicles propelled by any other power than muscular power, excepting traction engines, road rollers and vehicles which run only on rails or tracks. Trucks include all vehicles equipped or used to carry any - thing other than passengers. Numbers are assigned to vehicles consecutively (from number one up in each county) at the time the license fees are paid. Each county is assigned a key number desig - nating the order of the counties in which the large number of vehicles have been registered as for example a Douglas County Car with number 227 would carry 1-227 since Douglas County has the largest registration while a car with the same number in Hooker County with the smallest registration would carry 93-227. Numbers must be carried on front and back of the vehicle a minimum distance of six - teen inches from the ground. Certificates of registration showing ownership must be carried in containers in the car subject to public inspection. Registration fees are dependent upon the weight of the vehicle as follows: Motorcycles and two wheeled trucks weighing less than one thousand pounds $5.00 ($4.00 since the 1925 Legislature) motor vehicles less than two thousand pounds $10.00 ($8.00 since 1925 Legislature) with fifty cents additional for each one hundred pounds over two thousand pounds provided that upon vehicles equipped to carry more than seven passengers the total weight shall include the vehicle loaded to capacity with persons of 150 pounds weight. This latter provision changed by 1925 Legislature to a minimum fee of $25 plus $7 additional for each person for which the car is equipped to carry. Public owned motor vehicles are not taxed. Registration year extends from January 1 to December 31 with 50 per cent re - duction in fees on vehicles registered after July 1. (Changed by 1925 Legislature to 25% reduction in fees after each quarter of the year.) The minimum fee on trucks is $15 up to 4,000 pounds weight with 50c additional for each 100 pounds over 4,000 pounds. Foreign cars may stay in the state 30 days without purchasing a license, (changed by the 1925 Legislature to be reciprocal with all other states). </seg>
            <seg id="p028">DEPARTMENT OP PUBLIC WORKS 27 The maximum speed limit is 35 miles per hour on highways but does not apply to emergency calls of police, fire vehicles, doctors and ambulances, except when governed by city ordinances. Lenses must be tested by this Department for a fee of $10.00 and only approved lenses may be used. This Department is authorized to make rules and regulations governing lights and lenses. The following size and weight limitations are placed upon the operation of motor vehicles upon public highways: Width maximum 7% feet, height maximum 12 feet, 600 pounds maximum per inch width of tire, 7000 pounds maximum on one wheel. Advertising Signs — The Department has authority to mark the State Highway system from State Highway Funds or gas tax funds. No other signs are permitted on the State Highway right-of-way except where permit is granted by this Department. Only one or two permits have been granted in the past four years and not any will be granted in the future due to the new policy recently adopted by this Department. Perhaps a dozen has been granted in previous bienniums, only one of which was a state wide permit. Permits cannot be issued for signs larger than ten square feet surface. Signs can not be placed within 300 feet of a railroad crossing or highway intersection. All advertising concerns have been advised recently to remove all signs not covered by a permit and to remove those covered by a permit not later than July 1, 1927. All companies complied with this request promptly and agreeably so today there are practically no advertising signs except those covered by permit upon the state high - way system. The State Highway Harking system is described later. IMPROVEMENT DISTRICTS In addition to legislative appropriation funds the law provides several means of improving highways by various methods of assess - ing property benefitted under improvement districts created by the County Boards upon application of the districts. These laws are bulky and detailed but a few are summarized briefly here for general information. Douglas County Paving BUI — Applying to counties having popula - tion in excess of 150,000 provides that districts may be established, appraised and assessed as per benefits received. Lancaster County Paving Bill — Applying to counties having popula - tion of 40,000 to 100,000 provides that property over two miles from town can not be assessed over 10% of the total cost. Six zones are </seg>
            <seg id="p029">28 REPORT OF SECRETARY created bearing percentage of cost as follows: 50, 25, 10, 5, 5, 5%. tSarpy County Paving Bill — Applying to counties having popula - . of 9,000 — 10,000 provides that property may be assessed half ' between any two state highways but not over a distance of two is. Exclusive of state and federal aid funds which may be avail - i, the county at large is assessed twenty-five per cent of the re - ning cost and fifty per cent assessed on front footage of the prop - ' and twenty-five per cent to balance of property. I Precinct, Village, Township or County Bonds — May be Issued for rovements by petition vote of special election or* unanimous order he County Board but such issue in some instances can not exceed per cent of the assessed valuation of the district. A tax is erally levied on the district sufficient to pay interest and five per t of principal on bonds. There are many methods by which the division of State Government may form improvement districts be bonded as a unit but under the constitution the state can not io bonded. TYPICAL HIGHWAY LETTING It is of interest to many to know how a highway letting is handled at a time when several hundred bids are received with over a hundred bidders present besides many other interested parties and spectators. I The Nebraska method of holding highway lettings and awarding tracts has received so much favorable comment from the con - tors and general public that it is considered desirable to outline system briefly. Under this plan the Department holds several ;e highway lettings each year usually three or four each over a iod of two or three days so that a larger number of contractors present thus creating keen competition. When the large letting livided over two or three days all awards can be made promptly lout holding certified checks and unsuccessful bidders, particularly smaller contractors, may bid a second or third time with the le check. The following press report describes one of these lettings held in July, 1925: "892 Bids Received from 138 Bidders. An interesting event was witnessed by more than 400 people at the office of the department of public works on July 29, 30 and 31 when 138 different contractors submitted bids for road work amounting to more than $2,500,000. Probably no other like event has received so much favorable content by those interested as was heard on this occasion. Frequently con- </seg>
            <seg id="p030">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 29 tractors who have been bidding for road work in other states were heard to remark that this was the fairest and best organized letting they had ever witnessed. Each morning at 9:00 o'clock sharp, the work of opening and reading the bids began. A member of the county board, from the county in which the work was to be done, usually the chairman, sat with the state engineer as he read the different bids. The bids were tabulated as they were read, clerks were set to work to determine the successful bidder and the contract was signed by the secretary of the department of public works, the chairman of the county board and the contractor. Bonds were filed in the amount of 100% of the contract. Nearly all of this work was completed between the hours from nine a. m. and six p. m. Competition was so keen that the total amount of the contracts was 14% under the estimates made by the department of public works. A total of 892 bids were received, making an average of 12 to the project. The highest number of bids on any one project was 37. Of the 138 different bidders, 66 were successful. Kansas, Iowa, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota and Colorado were repre - sented by 13 different bidders. Six of these out-of-state bidders were successful. Contractors were required to file certified checks to the amount of 6% of their bids. The certified checks thus filed amounted to 11,103,124.77. The contracts covered 413 miles of gravel surfacing, 290 miles of grading and 3% miles of paving. The lowest bid for gravel surfac - ing was 7 cents per square yard for 2 inches of gravel. This con - tract was for 10.02 miles in Kearney County north from Axtell. The average cost for graveling of all the contracts let was about $800 per mile. The lowest price for earth excavation was 17 cents per cubic yard and the average price for all the earth excavation projects was 19.38 cents per cubic yard. Some very low bids were received for blade grader construction. This blade grader construction is possible in a level country where no cuts and fills are necessary. This type of construction, which will be paid for by state and federal aid funds, was contracted for as low as $184.80 per mile. The low bid for concrete paving was $2.03 per square yard, seven inches thick. This will make an 18 foot pavement cost about $21,000 a mile, exclusive of bridges, culverts, guard rails and grading." The following chart shows the plan of one of these lettings with Department employees represented by numbers from one to twenty-one. </seg>

            <seg id="p032">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 31 From the chart It is noted that the Department's large drafting room is used to open and read and tabulate all bids. This room ac - comodates about 100 contractors who wish table space to tabulate a part or all the bids as read. About 300 more contractors and spec - tators are accomodated in this room and the hallway. All bids are read through a broadcasting microphone connected through five loud speakers so every word is distinctly audible throughout the large room. All contract plans are displayed in the hallway as shown for three weeks preceding and during the letting. This permits the contractor to view these plans without interfering with or taking up valuable space of the Engineers and draftsmen. About 200 extra chairs are provided in the hallway tor the contractors and public during the letting. Three office rooms and the waiting room across the hallway as indicated is given over for the letting. The first room from the left is the awarding room, the second is a large waiting room in which is located the Department Telephone switchboard and operator. A large previously prepared bulletin board showing all projects and important construction items is hung in this waiting room so as fast as awards are made the successful contractors name is written in together with his unit bids. The third room is the computing room and the fourth is the accounting room given over to signing contracts, bonds, etc. The notice to contractors definitely stipulates the hour at which the receiving of bids will close. Most of these bids are personally handed to a Department representative within fifteen minutes of the closing time. When the hour for closing bids arrives the Department employees take places as shown on the chart. At table one, employee No. 1 has received all proposals and grouped them under their proper project numbers as shown on the sealed envelope. No. 1 cuts the sealed envelope, opens and arranges the bid and check passing same to No. 2. No. 2 calls the chairman or representative of the County Board, Circle A, to the stand to witness the opening and reading of the bids. No. 2 reads aloud the County, project number, bidder's name and address, amount of certified check and all items and bid prices submitted together with any special conditions or provisions the bidder may have inserted, then passes the proposal to Circle A who after inspection passes same to No. 3. No. 3 lists the certified checks for permanent record and passes this record, checks and proposal to No. 4 who acts as messenger between the reading rooms and the other rooms. No. 4 takes these records to table No. 5 in the contract room. Three tabulators Numbers 5, 6 and 7 are stationed at table No. 2 who tabulate all unit bid prices as read under the bidder's name </seg>
            <seg id="p033">32 REPORT OF SECRETARY together with any special provisions inserted by the bidder. These three tabulators with printed sheets carrying all units of construction tabulate independently as a check thus producing three originals and saving the necessity for repeated references to the many pro - posals during the awarding. When all bids are read oh a single project the completed tabulated sheets are passed to No. 4 who trans - mits them at once to No. 8 in the computing room. I No. 8 has charge of the computing and checking squads Nos. 9, 11, 12 and 13 at Table No. 3. No. 9 reads one tabulation sheet ud which is checked by Nos. 10 and 11. In reading the tabulation et No. 9 reads all items, quantities and unit bid prices which are ight by Nos. 12 and 13 and totals computed mechanically each ing as a check on the other. When computed No. 12 with No. 13 eking reads back the results to Nos. 9, 10 and 11 for recording. ?se sheets are then passed back to No. 8 who makes the final addi - is on an adding machine, extends all totals, checks and circles low bid on each item, group or permissable combination of groups covered in the specifications or stipulated in the proposal. When the low bidders are determined these sheets are passed to No. 14 who carries same to the awarding room. In the awarding room No. 14 is ready to furnish any desired In - formation relative to the bidder's proposal, special provisions, plans, etc. to No. 15, the State Engineer, who makes the award. The State Engineer in joint session with the members of the County Board or their representative, Circle A, review the bids, discuss the prices and take such action toward awarding or rejection as they deem advisable. A complete record of all minutes is kept by the steno - grapher, No. 16. In the event any question as to Federal policy or desires is raised, circle X, a representative of the Federal Bureau is consulted as previously mentioned. Any contracts advertised after November 9, 1926 must be awarded by the State Engineer alone without the vote of the county officials unless by policy he desires to have the Board express their wishes by vote but joint responsibility for any action taken can not be extended to the County Board. As soon as an award is made No. 14 prints the contractor's name and unit bid prices on a large previously prepared bulletin board in the waiting room. This information becomes available at once to all contractors and the press. When an award is made No. 17 who has charge of the contract room takes the tabulation sheet and together with the chairman of the County Board, the successful contractor and bondsman retire to table No. 5 in the contract room.

These contracts are signed at once by all parties thus avoiding long delays through the malls and also permits ot the immediate release ot all certified checks. No. 21 re-, ceives all certified checks as delivered by No. 4 from the reading, room. After contracts are signed all checks are released to the con - tractors by No. 21 upon signed receipt of deliverance. Within 15 or 20 minutes after the bids are read on the first project all rooms become active so that while bids are being opened in the reading room, read and tabulated, low bidders are being determined in the ■computing room, awards are being made in the awarding room,: results given to the press in the waiting room and contracts are be - ing signed in the contract room. If the letting Is small less than half as many employees are necessary and all bids are read before the awarding is started. Usually the reading of bids starts at 9 A. M. and is continuous until 1 P. M. The awards are completed on these same projects by 5 P. M. Under the above system of awarding con - tracts from twenty-five to thirty average highway projects, each with from one to five separate contracts carrying the usual number of road and bridge items with ten to forty bidders on each project totalling several million dollars can be read, awarded, contracts and bonds signed and checks returned between the hours of 9 A. H. and 5 P. M. During the present biennium approximately 750 different contracts have been executed by this Bureau. GRAVEL ROADS Gravel roads are no longer an experiment in Nebraska. No more promotion work need be done on this type of construction as the en - tire state is fully sold on Nebraska's gravel roads. "Would rather drive a gravel road than a pavement" is a common remark. Not only have the gravel roads made it possible for the people of Nebraska to see the beauties and resources of their own common - wealth at any time of the year and thus advertise the state to its own inaabitants but they have also advertised the state to the entire na - tion through favorable reports of tourists. All this at a surprisingly low cost which cost represents an investment paying annually several hundred per cent dividends not alone through advertising and bring - ing outside wealth into the state but through reduced motor operation costs to the state's own people. State Highway Engineers in neighboring states are generally agreed that an 8" gravel road can withstand economically only 400 vehicles per day. This is no doubt an established fact in the states having less favorable soil conditions, heavier rainfall and a poorer grade of gravel than is found in this state. The Nebraska people are 2 </seg>
            <seg id="p035">34 REPORT OF SECRETARY ready to spread the facts proven through experience that generally speaking half this amount of gravel will withstand from three to five times the amount of traffic and continue to do so without re - placement for several years. These are bold statements but the evidence lies in every direction over the state. For example, consider the Cornhusker Highway between Lincoln and Fremont in Saunders County. Note the gravel road photgraph titled "State-Federal Aid Project No. 27, 2" or 4" Gravel Surfacing." This road has formed a better riding surface than the average pave - ment 12 months out of the year except for the occasional dust nuis - ance. This section of road is known as State-Federal Aid Project No. 27. The gravel surfacing was started in the late fall of 1919 and completed in the early summer of 1920, thus giving 7 years service up to the present time. About 6.5 miles of this project was surfaced with gravel 4" deep and 4.5 miles was surfaced 2" deep. The main - tenance costs have averaged slightly less than the cost on adjoining dirt roads or about $265 per mile per year exclusive of replacement.

            <seg id="p036">DEPARTMENT OP PUBLIC WORKS 35 State Federal Aid Project Xo. 27, 4" Gravel Surfacing Attention is directed to the fact as indicated on both views on Project No. 27 that the roadway is being widened 3 feet on either side, changing the present 24 foot width to 30 foot width and the small windrow of gravel placed is to surface the new shoulders. Picture taken in November, 1926. Both sections gave splendid service for six years without any replace - ment. About a year ago the 2" section began to pit out and break through in places due to the thinness of the gravel mat, consequently one additional inch of Platte River gravel was spread over the surface. In a few days the surface was again in a splendid state of main - tenance and has continued so up to the present date. A few weeks ago the 4" surface began to show wear in spots and it was difficult to bring out sufficient gravel through dry weather maintenance to keep the necessary thin film of loose gravel over the roadway. Immediately one-half inch of Platte River gravel was added over the surface and today the road is in a high state of maintenance and will very prob - ably continue in this condition for over a year without further re - placement. The average traffic over this road the year round haa been probably 1000 vehicles daily. The traffic census taken one week </seg>

The census (or 1926 taken in the same manner indicated an average daily traffic of 1401 vehicles for the 15 hours of daylight. The probable traffic for the 24 hour day would no doubt be in excess of 2000 vehicles on this 24 foot roadway. Let us review another State-Federal Aid project of newer con - struction but carrying heavier traffic. Note the photograph of this road with the title "Staie-Federal Aid Projects No. 17." This eleven mile project lying just outside of Lincoln on the Lincoln-Omaha road usually called the D. L. D. or U. S. No. 38 Highway was con - structed early in 1923 with a 4 inch depth of gravel surfacing. After more than three years service the surface is in perfect condition sup - porting fast traffic including passenger busses, heavy freight trucks and cars averaging in 1924, 1434 vehicles daily during the daylight hours and in 1926, 1830 vehicles in 15 daylight hours. The probable traffic for the 24 hour day would certainly exceed 2500 vehicles. Less than 5% of the amount of the original gravel has been added to the project since completion. The greater part of the road has had no replacements, however some sections have had a load added here and there at weak spots and a few sections covering several hundred feet in a continuous stretch but totaling less than a mile altogether have had a fraction of an inch added more or less uni - formly so the estimate of 5 % replacement is amply high. The above two projects are typical of the gravel mileage all over the state of which 1616 miles was contracted this biennium. When the taxpayers are confronted with these facts on the life of gravel roads built on the interest of the cost of pavement it is impossible for the state to put over a paving bond issue and is in fact difficult to provide funds for these sections where a gravel surface is plainly inadequate due to soil conditions, rainfall or excessive traffic. With the average pavement costs at $25,000 per mile, the interest on bonds at 5% is $1250 per year. This interest will build and maintain a three inch gravel road every two years. From the previous discussion it is apparent that due to the proven life of Nebraska's gravel roads under limited traffic that the interest on paving bonds will not only build and maintain an equal mileage of gravel roads but will leave a surplus of perhaps $5,000 per mile over a six year period which can be used to triple the mileage con - structed or improve the existing surfaces constructed. A six year period is considered because this represents the older gravel roads in the state and they have withstood this length of service splendidly. </seg>
            <seg id="p039">38 REPORT OF SECRETARY Referring to the saving of $5000 it is predicted that this saving will be used in Nebraska in the near future in improving the existing gravel surfaces with a black top non-rigid type of pavement built of oils or asphalts. Within the next four years this state will witness the construction of an enormous mileage of this type of gravel sur - face protection much the same as they have witnessed the gravel accomplishment the past two or three years. The demand for this type of construction will not be due so much to the failure of the gravel under increased traffic as it will be due to the possible allevia - tion of the dust nuisance during the dry periods. A four inch gravel surfacing has been the maximum for Nebraska with the exception of one contract using 6 inches of local poor grade gravel but many miles of two inch and three inch depths have been constructed. The policy of the present administration is to put, under agreement with the Federal Bureau a total depth of gravel surfacing of 4 inches or 6 inches to be contracted by the State in two* courses. The second course to be contracted when needed. The 4" or 6 inch depth will be made upr of two 2 inch courses or one 3 inch or 4 inch course following later by a second course of 3 inches or 2 inches respectively.

            <seg id="p040">DEPARTMENT OP PUBLIC WORKS 39 GRAVEL SPECIFICATIONS AND METHODS OP CONSTRUCTION Some credit for the unusual success of gravel roads in Nebraska must be given to the materials and methods of construction. A slightly larger part of the gravel used in Nebraska is pumped from the Platte River and screened according to specifications. This gravel is very hard and so fine that engineers are inclined to speak of the material as sand rather than gravel. Out-of-state engineers, after reviewing the Nebraska specifications, comment that this state has no gravel roads but rather a sand-clay type of construction. Ne - braska does have a sand-clay type of road construction but it is much different from the so-called gravel or sand-gravel surfacing. The general screen analysis for gravel surfacing is as follows: passing one inch screen — 100%, retained on No. 4 sieve from 0 to 50%, retained on No. 10 sieve — from 70 to 90%. Clay &amp; silt con - tent not over 20%. To obtain the above analysis, from 20% to 80% of the pumped gravel is screened out as fine sand. This analysis may be modified to meet the conditions found in suitable dry gravel deposits or unusually finely graded river deposits carrying as low as 55% retention on a No. 10 sieve. The thickness placed of the lower test gravel is increased to obtain the same quantity on No. 10 sieve as Standard or 70%. The pumped gravel when delivered upon the road is absolutely clean and void of any silt or clays so that the finished surface should depend upon the gravel producing its own binder by pebbles pulveriz - ing under traffic into stone dust cement which forms the best possible binder following the rains. Traffic is not in the mood, however, to await this longer period for compaction necessitated if the gravel forms its own binder so a satisfactory but less permanent binder is supplied by adding a light mixture ol the subgrade in the gravel after placing. This subgrade has been incorporated in the gravel the past 7 years by the following methods; scarifying, discing, harrowing, blad - ing shoulder slopes and ditch cleanings over the gravel surface, and by placing the gravel in thin layers under traffic which beats the gravel into the subgrade or brings up a small part through wear. The ap - plication of thin layers under traffic as shown in the view on Proj. 71-E, as rapidly as traffic compacts same has proven to be by far the most satisfactory method since a good percentage of stone dust binder is produced and traffic is not hindered. In late fall or prolonged dry seasons a light scarifying or discing has proven desirable to hasten the incorporation of the gravel, but in general scarifying is a dangerous process unless at least one inch of gravel is left in a windrow to work over the finished scarifed roadbed for wearing course. A new gravel </seg>
            <seg id="p041">40 REPORT OF SECRETARY road receiving too much scarifying compacts quickly, forms a good sur - face quickly but wears out quickly, due to the addition of too much low grade binder and for the same reason such a road is badly rutted and cut up following a rain. When the rainfall and traffic is heavy and heavy soil conditions exist then a heavier first application should be placed, say a six inch depth of which four inches should be scarified and two inches left to spread over the finished surface and compacted under traffic and maintenance. State Federal Aid Project No. 71-E Note gravel Windrows right shoulder from where it is spread across roadway as traffic compacts it. The secrets of good gravel roads are believed to have been solved. Proper highway construction and drainage is the first essential fol - lowed by clean gravel deposited in one windrow on one shoulder line from which it can be spread in one-halt inch layers across the care - fully prepared and smooth roadbed as rapidly as traffic compacts it. </seg>
            <seg id="p042">DEPARTMENT OP PUBLIC WORKS 41 This construction must be followed by Intensive heavy maintenance during the heavy rains, not several hours or days after the rain, al - though continuous maintenance on dry graveled roads carrying a thin layer of loose gravel is essential. Such maintenance avoids chatter bumps, or corrugations, and keeps a thin film of loose but not ob - jectionable gravel evenly spread over the surface. Nebraska's fine, hard, clean gravel with all stones over one inch diameter removed, compacts solidly and does not ravel. Too much natural clay content or the addition of a high per cent of local soil binder destroys the life of the road. Larger stones, if permitted, tip and rock under traffic, causing a small hole. The impact of traffic soon produces a large ob - jectionable pot hole where once lay an oversized stone. One pot hole forms another particularly easy in the presence of objectionable foreign matter as lumps of earth, sod, or pieces of cloth used to plug leaky freight cars in shipment. These details are watched by the De - partment's inspector to insure a good gravel highway. Gravel road construction has assumed such importance in this state that an exhaustive study of gravel road construction, wear under traffic and maintenance, and results is being made. This study has just start - ed and involves so much work and detail analysis that any conclusions drawn from the meager information-at hand might not be correct. A detailed report should be available for the public in about six months. To begin this research a questionnaire was prepared and the District Engineers instructed to take samples of the gravel surfacing, and sub - grade from all projects and fill in the questionnaires in detail. The samples were forwarded to the Testing Engineer to break down and analyze in detail. An interesting fact uncovered in this investigation and which might be mentioned here is the general distinctions of the layer of gravel surfacing or so called mats. This mat usually about 2-3 or 3-4 the depth of the original application has a distinct and well denned line of demarcation between the mat and subgrade similar to the asphalt top or mat on a concrete base. There appears to be no gradual grading of the surfacing into the subgrade regardless of the method of original construction. From this research it is hoped that better methods of construction may be developed and a better specification be written reducing future maintenance costs. It is desired to know the clay or binder contents in the new and older gravel mats, the difference between the upper and lower half of the mats as to binder content, and gravel sieve analysis, also to know the effect of traffic on the surface in grinding down the gravel particles to a finer sieve analysis, the effect of different kinds of soil subgrades, and the effect and result of different kinds of soil subgrades, and the effect and result of different gravel specifica - tions, construction methods and maintenance methods. </seg>

            <seg id="p045">44 REPORT OF SECRETARY Sand and Gravel. Most of Nebraska's sand and gravel is pro - duced from mantle rock deposits, but a small portion is derived from the bedrock formation. These sources of gravel in Nebraska range in geologic time from the Pennsylvania Beds to the Dakota Formation, the Arikaree Formation, the Ogallala Formation, an unnamed tertiary formation, glacio-fluvial deposits, glacial drift and alluvium. Among these the most important are the alluvium of the Platte River, the Aftonian Sand Plain and gravel bodies occurring at the base of the Dakota Formation. Pennsylvania Formation. The Pennsylvania Beds outcrop in the southeastern counties of the state. Sand is found only in a few strata such as those outcroppings at Peru and south Falls City. Here the sand is too fine to be of much value as a road material. Dakota Formation. The Dakota Formation consists mainly of a buff to a rusty brown sand stone heavily stained with iron. At the base of the formation lying unconformably on the Pennsylvania rocks are lenticular beds of sand and fine gravel. The sand is too fine for most construction work but the gravel is very good for road surfacing. These deposits occur quite extensively in the vicinity of Louisville. The gravel ranges from 10 to 20 feet in thickness and contains a great many clay balls, large boulders and often a small body of fire clay. There is also in the same vicinity a buried gravel body which is glacio - fluvial or a stream deposit of cretaceous time. The deposit extends in a generally southeasterly direction from Cedar Creek to south of Rich - field and is about ten miles in length. Sand is produced from this de - posit at several places. Arikaree Formation. The Arikaree Formation outcrops over a large area in northwestern Nebraska. The sands are grayish and gen - erally of fine texture. In a few places it contains deposits of coarse gravel suitable for construction work. Ogallala Formation. This formation is the bedrock in a large portion of the southwestern counties of Nebraska. It outcrops along the Republican River from below Franklin westward to the state line, and in the Lodgepole and North Platte Valleys. It contains a vast amount of sand and gravel some of which occurs as a friable sand stone conglomerate. The particles are made up of rounded grains of material loosely cemented by a calcareous cement. Sand of the Late Tertiary Age. Beneath the loess of much of central Nebraska and extending eastward under the western edge of glacial deposits is an unnamed tertiary formation which carried vast quantities of sand interstratified with layers of clay and silt. This formation forms nearly a continuous sand plain from 25 to 100 feet </seg>
            <seg id="p046">DEPARTMENT OP PUBLIC WORKS 45 thick, outcropping along the Missouri River in Northeastern Nebraska as in Knox and Cedar Counties and in the valleys along the Republi - can River in the southwestern counties. The extent of this sand plain is not known nor what its geologic relation to the drift sheet may be. Much of the sand is too fine for use but a portion of it may be utilised as a surfacing material for roads. It is too dirty for concrete work, containing not only clay and silt but also an iron cement. The Glacio-Fluvial or Aftonian Sand Plain. This plain lies be - tween the Nebraska and Kansas drift sheets and has a thickness of from 10 to 70 feet. The sand varies from dirty to clean and from fine sand to coarse gravel. It contains boulders, cobbles and large clay balls which were undoubtedly carried to their present positions from the north, by streams during the glacial time. Just what caused these streams to drop their heavy load in eastern and central Ne - braska is not known. This sand plain extends through much of the upland of the loess hill and drift areas of Nebraska and is reported also in southwestern Iowa, northwestern Missouri and northeastern Kansas. Sand is produced commercially from this source at Fairbury, Endi - cott, DeWitt, Ulysses, Wahoo, Superior, Nelson and Hebron from the same horizon. As a surfacing material this gravel is one of the best in the state. It is of suitable size and quality and has a good binder of clay and iron oxide. When this gravel is laid upon a road and subjected to the impact of traffic it forms a surface which is extremely hard and urable in either wet or dry weather. Glacial Drift. The drift of the Kansas sheet covers approximately the tier of the eastern four counties of Nebraska. It is evidenced on the surface by large boulders of many kinds of material, by rounded pebbles in the soil or by a heavy red clay. The deposits occur In pockets which contain material grading from extremely fine sand to large boulders. At the base of these deposits the material is usually clean but is badly stained with iron, making it a poor ag- gregate for concrete, but has some value as a surfacing material when the oversized stone is crushed finer than a 1 inch seive. Either for construction work or surfacing material drift sands are poor at best, and the supply is so limited that at the present tima it seems inadvisable to utilize it to any considerable extent. Dune Sand. Dune Sand is the prevailing surface formation of the well known sand hill region. It is too fine for any road use in that location and offers a serious problem to road construction where - ever it exists. </seg>
            <seg id="p047">46 REPORT OF SECRETARY Alluvium. The alluvial deposits of sand and gravel in the state are by far the most important sources of road material. These de - posits occur in the valleys of the Platte, Loup, Elkhorn, Blue, Re - publican and Missouri Rivers. The alluvium of the Platte is very coarse in the western part of the state, becoming finer toward the east, due of course to the action of the water upon the material. That of the Loup and Elkhorn rivers is almost too fine for road use. The Big and Little Blue carry material derived from the Aftonian Sand Plain, tertiary sand and glacial drift. Much of the sand is used commercially. The alluvium of the Republican Valley varies a great deal in size and quality depending upon the region. That of the Missouri grades from very fine sand to clay and is seldom used. In the Alluvium of the Platte, Nebraska has an unlimited source of road material. This alluvium ranges from twenty-five to 100 feet in thickness and extends the full width of the Platte Valley through - out its course. It grades from fine sand to coarse gravel and is very hard and durable making an ideal concrete or road surfacing aggregate when screened to proper sizes. Stnte Owned Gravel Land. The gravel land near Ashland pur - chased by the State in May, 1920, is located in Sections 30 and 31 of Township 13 North, Range 10 East, Saunders County. It is on the main line of the C. B. &amp; Q. Railroad between Lincoln and Omaha. There are a great many reasons which enter into the fact that Platte Valley land in the vicinity of Ashland is almost ideal for gravel production. The Platte valley is about 1 % miles in width at this point so the river has had neither a chance to change its course appreciably nor has it lost any of its velocity. There are no tributary streams flowing into the Platte which might carry finer material im - mediately above this location and the river has not meandered enough to appreciably change the alluvium, as originally deposited, below a depth of about ten feet. There are 62.8 acres of deed land in the tract purchased. With this the State received title to thirty-four acres of accretion land. The tract has 2100 feet of trackage on the main line of the C. B. &amp; Q. It is possible to produce from this land approximately 500,000 cubic yards of standard road gravel or 1,000,000 cubic yards of con - crete gravel- and the supply from the river is unlimited. The land is protected on the south from overflow by the grade of the C. B. &amp; Q. railroad and on the east along the river front by a dike thrown up by the railroad company which facts are indeed an advantage. The gravel on this tract when analyzed, tested from forty to forty - six per cent retained on a No. 10 screen with the exception of a small area of about twenty-seven acres which has about ten feet of fine sand deposited on the surface. To date it has been unneces- </seg>
            <seg id="p048">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 47 sary to open this pit to secure proper gravel prices from the variouB commercial companies within the radius that this pit might be made to serve. Since freight rates greatly reduce the area that might be served from any gravel pit, it may prove advisable to acquire additional ground for sources of gravel supply in various parts of the state, parti - cularly along the Platte and Republican Rivers. Survey Methods. The survey of road materials in Nebraska has been conducted for several years by the State Conservation and Soil Survey, however, when the Federal Aid program was enacted a more detailed survey of certain areas became necessary which was carried on by the Department's engineering forces. The most important road materials surveyed are deposits of sand, gravel, clay and stone suitable for road construction. For the benefit of county officials and others interested in general road work, a few general statements will be made regarding methods used. The problem of testing sand deposits is divided into distinct phases; first, that of testing alluvial deposits, and second, that of testing bank deposits. These will be treated separately as follows: Alluvial Sand Testing. The economic side of the production of gravel enters so thoroughly into the situation that the quality of gravel possible to produce is often necessarily disregarded because of economic features. A site must be chosen not only with regard to the possibilities of producing gravel of good quality, and also with regard to distance tr the road upon which it is to be used, with regard to shipping facilities, and the purchase price of the land. Having decided upon a plot of land which is suitably located the detailed examination of that particular deposit is made. All alluvial gravel lies either practically at or below the water line, therefore it is necessary to procure such equipment as will work under these conditions. A casing four or six inches in diameter is sunk and the sand is removed from within this casing by either a sand bucket, a sand pump or a trap auger. The pump is often times mechanically inefficient, and the sand bucket gives a false impression as to the exact stratification of the sand. The trap auger is the most certain and effective tool for this work. It removes the gravel exactly as it occurs in the ground, taking out the fine and course materials in their exact relationship. It is much slower than either of 'the methods mentioned above but one may be certain of the results ob - tained. </seg>
            <seg id="p049">48 REPORT OF SECRETARY After several test holes have been put down evenly distributed over the plot of ground and samples have been obtained at different depths in these holes, the results are averaged and the quality of gravel possible to produce from the centain plot of ground determined. Next, quantities of material present must be figured. An easy way of doing this in the field is to figure the area of usable ground In square yards, multiply this by the depth to which the gravel may be worked and make a correction for the material to be wasted by screening. This will give approximately the number of yards of gravel in a given area. It then becomes necessary to map the ground as to the best possi - ble location for trackage, driveways, buildings and the pits, so as to give the largest areas possible to gravel production. Classify the ground as to the number of trees or stumps to be pulled, the amount of stripping to be done and the nature of the material to be stripped, and evaluate the land to be purchased. Bank Pits. The location of a dry land pit is much more com - plicated and uncertain as to results than is that of the alluvial pit. The material is these bank pits is derived from the sand plains, from two unnamed tertiary deposits and glacial pockets and because of the manner of their deposition great care must be taken in their survey. These deposits are not consistent as to thickness, quantity, quality of gealogic relation to other formations making deductions very uncertain. If seeking to locate a pit in an area where only bank pits will be possible, trace up the drainage ways in the vicinity, looking for a stream or intermittent drainage which carries gravel. If such a stream is found, follow this until the gravel body is located. Then determine the elevation of this layer of gravel and trace it by the use of a level and surface indications until a suitable location for production is found. Proceed by putting down test holes and by the methods stated previously, determine the exact quantities of gravel present. Clay. Clay as treated here is used as a surfacing material on sand roads and as a binding material on sand-clay roads or sand - clay roads to be surfaced with gravel. In nearly all places in the state where gravel roads are constructed the road soil and gravel dust has sufficient cementing quality to bind the gravel together into a hard wearing surface, but in some vicinities where sand-clay roads have been built additional clay must be added to insure a suitable foundation and binder for a gravel course. </seg>
            <seg id="p050">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS Clay Is used frequently in the sandhill regions as a surfacing materia'. where it not only binds together the fine particles of sand but als) forms a hard crust-like surface that will stand the wear ot the traffic. When seeking a suitable deposit of clay the assistance of local officials 01 old settlers is invited. In a few instances particularly around Hecla, Nebraska, in Hooker County this problem of locating clay became so keen that the help of local people was not sufficient and several survey parties were ordered out at various periods to search the country thoroughly and make hundreds of borings within economical hauling distance on either side of the proposed road. Samples of all material containing any noticeable clay content were forwarded to the Testing Engineer and finally small deposits were discovered carrying the minimum possible amount of clay that could be utilized for road surfacing. Without the aid of the state labora - tories in this instance the survey would have reported a failure. A sand-clay or gravel-clay road is constructed most effectively when the sand and clay are mixed in proper proportions. These proportions are not. purely arbitrary but are determined by definite tests of the material to be used and application of these tests made within economic limits. These proportions may be determined roughly iu the field but better results are obtained by forwarding samples to the Etate testing engineer for detail analysis and reports. Gravel Deposits. The Platte River Valley is the most important source of sand and gravel in the state. There are about 30 com - mercial producing plants located at different points along this stream within the limits of Nebraska. Nearly all of the aggregate for con - crete work, and 60% of the gravel for surfacing on Nebraska Federal Aid roads is secured from this source. Some of this material is being shipped to other states who are patterning after Nebraska gravel roads. Outside the limits of the Platte River Valley, the most important commercial sand and gravel producing plants are located at the follow - ing towns: Long Pine, Burwell, Norfolk, Cowles, Fairbury, Endicott, Atkinson and McCook. During the last three years there has been a rapidly growing de - mand for gravel surfacing on the State Highway system. This has led to an increased interest in local deposits that might be suitable and available for surfacing purposes. Much exploration work has been done by the State Highway Department, by the local road authorities and by the contractors since the Department does not guarantee the availability of any gravel at any highway letting. This </seg>
            <seg id="p051">50 REPORT OF SECRETARY is especially true in sections of the state, to which freight rates are extremely high from Platte River pits. Many deposits have been un - covered and utilized, in places where previously there was little idea, that gravel existed in pay quantities. By utilizing these local gravel deposits many thousands of dollars have been saved to the tax payers in freight charges alone. In the past it has been the policy of the Department to leave the securing of leases for privately owned local gravel deposits either up to the County Board of Commissioners of the county in which the surfacing was to be done, or to the successful contractors. It is believed that considerable uncertainty among contractors can be eliminated, and an appreciable economy effected, if the Department of Public Works had funds to investigate and determine the location, quality and quantity of gravel accessible to any given project and to secure favorable leases from land owners on all available deposit* prior to advertising for bids. Stone Deposits. There are very few stone deposits of commercial value in the State. The quarries located at Louisville and Weeping Water are the most important. A large deposit of sand stone, located near Indianola has been tested and found suitable for concrete aggregate. It is proposed to lay an experimental section of Macadam road from this material which although slightly soft should give reasonably fair service. A similar experiment tried at Falls City on a small section of road did not lend much encouragement to the use of local crushed stone. Portland Cement. This state has one cement mill located at Super - ior. This mill has a daily capacity of 3000 barrels. At the present time private interests are planning the erection of one or more cement mills in the Eastern part of the State near Louisville. HIGH POINTS IX NEBRASKA HISTORY So many inquiries have been received by this Bureau from tourists over the United States as well as local citizens for information touch - ing upon points in Nebraska of historical interest which could be visited by a stranger that certainly some recognition ought to be made of these inquiries. Upon consideration it must be admitted that any highway report of this nature, no matter how brief, would not be complete if some mention were not made of the possible points of historical interest to which the State Highway system can lead the speeding business man or the most idle traveler in a few hours time. </seg>
            <seg id="p052">DEPARTMENT OP PUBLIC WORKS 51 The usual automobile club is fully equipped with information for the tourist who is enthusiastically informed repeatedly relative to Ne - braska's splendid graveled or earth highways, her extensive prairies and agricultural districts, beautifully wooded hills and wide rivers, the many lakes with their wonderful fishing and hunting, in fact the many things which those people who are living only in the present enjoy but few if any of these clubs advise relative to those things which make a red blooded American stop and ponder and which stay in his mind long after his sporting or scenic trips are forgotten. Too few of these clubs are instructed to advise or direct the public to places of historical interest as Blue Creek Battlefield, Ancient Indian Villages, Fontenelle's Battlefield, Earliest White Towns, Massacre Canyon, Red Cloud's Surrender, Beecher Island Battlefield, Oregon Trail Monuments, Buffalo Bill's Ranch and dozens of other interest - ing points of history. Space will not permit in this report the relation of important events in history which made possible the great advancement in this state and the demand for modern highways of today. Even the thrilling tales of lesser importance but perhaps of more interest to the average individual must be omitted. It is readily understood why the present generation, particularly those from the eastern portion of our nation who have read some Nebraska history describing the early sacrifices, the heroic battles between the Red and White man, refer to this stato as "'Out Where the West Begins" and "The Wide Open Spaces" of "Where Men are Men." All this must be left for those sufficiently interested to make further inquiry of the State Librarians or Stale Historians.

            <seg id="p062">DEPARTMENT OP PUBLIC WORKS 61 DIVISION OP LOCATION, CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE In this Division the Chief of Bureau and Assistant Chief function directly through eight district engineers upon whose shoulders Is placed direct responsibility for the proper location, construction and maintenance of the state highway system. Through group conferences monthly in the State Capitol Building with the District Engineers and by occasional field trips usually with District Engineers, or Testing Engineer, the Chief of Bureau is en - abled to keep in close contact with all field work. Such monthly con - ferences, where the problems and accomplishments of each District Engineer are discussed and future policies established, result in a very great benefit to the individual Engineers and the functioning of the organization as a whole. One highly successful conference waa held in the western portion of the state at Scottsbluff in October of this year. At least one meeting in the west should be held each year so that the eastern District Engineers and the office engineer might view the efforts and results of the Western District Engineers. Such a meeting together with the tour around the state is highly educational and of great value to the Departmental organization. Each Dictrict Engineer has established permanent headquarters centrally located with reference to highways and railroad service In his district to best serve the purpose of the office. The ten outstanding duties of the District Engineer follow, together with a brief explanation of each duty. LOCATION 1. The District Engineer is largely responsible for the location of the highways. Too little power is granted this Department in the location of highways and acquiring of right of way and a correspond - ingly too much is granted to the local county officials who although competent are often-times seriously embarrassed by their contituents unfair demands upon them relative to a location benefiting a town or private interests at the expense of the state as a whole. Through engineering influence and with the aid of the - Federal Engineer at the time of inspection the District Engineer can obtain a reasonable location for the highway or recommend the postponement of con - struction. 2. Preliminary survey parties are under the direction of the District Engineers. The Preliminary Engineer is shown the general alignment to be surveyed and reports direct to the District Engineer. The funds available this biennium as in all past bienniums has been </seg>
            <seg id="p063">REPORT OF SECRETARY 62 too meager to permit the Preliminary Engineer to do justice to the necessary field investigation which would insure proper and economic highway location, design and construction. 3. Through cooperation with the County Boards of Commissioners and Supervisors the District Engineer obtains resolutions required by statute locating highways, requesting state-federal construction, pledg - ing funds for various purposes such as right of way, materials and construction. 4. The District Engineer makes the plan-in-hand inspection upon which the final plans are made previous to constracting. Upon receipt of tentative plans from the Office Engineer, the District Engineer and Federal Engineer, usually in company with the County Board, make an inspection over the route laying the proposed grade line and re - commending adequate surfacing and drainage structures. CONSTRUCTION 5. The District Engineer has direct supervision over all con - struction on the state highway system and all state aid bridges re - gardless of their location. Frequent inspection trips are made over all work to insure adequate engineering, satisfactory progress by the contractor and proper completion. 6. The District Engineer is responsible for the engineering parties in charge of construction. Such parties consist of a Project Engineer, generally in charge of several projects together with instrument men, inspectors, rodmen, and chainmen. The Project Engineer reports direct to the District Engineer. 7. The District Engineer checks and approves all payrolls, ex - pense vouchers, changes in construction plans, agreements, progress and final estimates submitted by the Project Engineer. MAINTENANCE 8. The District Engineer prepares a budget for each county at the beginning of each year of anticipated expenditures for maintenance on the state highway system and previous to January 1, 1926, sub - mitted this budget to the County Board of their approval. Patrol sections were designated, equipment purchased, and patrolmen hired in accordance with the approved budget which previous to January 1. 1926, could not exceed 75% of the automobile license collections. After January 1, 1926, the State assumed all maintenance responsi - bility so budgets are now filed only with the Bureau and expenditures allowed in each county from a sum apportioned by this office. This </seg>
            <seg id="p064">. DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 63 apportionment is based upon the predetermined needs of the county and district and the total of the budget controlled accordingly. MISCELLANEOUS 9. The markings of the state highway system and placement of advertising signs are also under the supervision of the District En - gineer. During the past biennium the Department has removed the old highway numbers and all advertising signs and started a system - atic marking and signing of the state roads as described later. The Department has authority to approve advertising signs upon the highway but has adopted a policy of no more approvals and a cleaning up of the right of way. In fact only one approval was granted for the previous biennium and this was for an individual sign and no approvals have been granted this biennium. In the campaign for clearing up the right of way the Department has received the splendid and solid support of all advertising and business concerns. All signs have been removed except those covered by a previously authorized permit. This latter class will be removed before July 1, 1927. 10. The District Engineers are frequently called upon to address meetings, discuss matters with various delegations, and to represent the Department at different times. For this reason considerable re - sponsibility is placed upon District Eng ; jeers in promoting cooperation between various organizations, units of government, and the public.

            <seg id="p067">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 65 HIGHWAY MARKING During the present biennium one of the outstanding improvements being made is the uniform marking of the State Highway System. - For a number of years the need of this marking has been very apparent, however, Nebraska did not commence this for the reason that it was felt that a standard system all over the United States should first be adopted. The American Association of State Highway officials in 1924 ap - pointed a committee to work out a uniform system of warning signs and also an interstate system of marking roads carrying the same numbers throughout, the only change in the markers being the name of the State in passing from one state to another. The interstate routes selected in Nebraska are the Lincoln High - way, U. S. Route No. 30; Grant Highway, U. S. Route No. 20; D. L. D. Highway, U. S. Route No. 38; Washington Highway, U. S. Route No. 75; Cornhusker Highway, U. S. Route No. 77; Meridian Highway, U. S. Route No. 81 and Platte Valley Highway, U. S. Route No. 26. A uniform system of warning signs is based upon what is known as the "shape system;" a round sign meaning a railroad crossing, a diamond shaped sign indicating some hazard within the road itself necessitating slow speed and a square sign caution with respect to some possible hazard outside of the road such as a school house, cross roads, etc. This system of warning signs is universal all over the United States. Over one half of the States already having erected markers conforming to this and practically all of the rest of the states having assured of their compliance with it during the next year. It is the opinion of those who have made a study of this proposition that it is one of the most important steps ever taken in the way of promoting convenience and safety for the traveling public. All warn - ing signs have a 24 inch diameter or side dimension using black letters on a yellow background thus the yellow color wherever seen on the highway flashes the warning signal and the shape transmits the degree or class of danger ahead. In order that this marking system can be most efficient, it is necessary that all advertising signs be removed from within the right of way and it is desirable that advertising signs be removed from the vicinity of the right of way. In line with this, the Department has had removed the greater part of the advertising signs lying within the right of way, during the current year. 1 </seg>
            <seg id="p068">66 REPORT OF SECRETARY The State Highway Marker adopted by this Department is the covered wagon, emblematic of the state's early history. This marker is 15 inches square with black figures on a white background which is distinctive from the warning signs. The following picture story indicates the marking system on East "O" Street directing the traveler over several routes without hesita - tion. The first view shows the tourist that he is on highways No. U. S. 38 leading to Omaha and across the State of Iowa, No. U. S. 77 leading to Fremont, Sioux City and North to Canada and No. 11 leading east to Union near the Iowa State line. The second view turns the traveler on U. S. 77 to the left but pulls the traveler on U. S. 38 or No. 11 across the intersection as indicated by the sign in the distance across the intersection. A close up view of the latter sign is shown in the third picture. Continuing east on "O" Street the fourth view turns the U. S. 38 traffic to the left while just beyond the intersection the covered wagon pulls the traffic on No. 11 straight ahead as shown on the 5th view. The junction sign informs the autoist that he is ap - proaching a state highway four hundred feet ahead. This is a 24 inch square with black letters and figures on a white background. The picture view No. 6, indicates the junction of highway No. 24 from the south midway between views No. 1 and No. 2 with U. S. 38, U. S. 77 and No. 11. The marker indicating route No. 24 may be seen at the corner on the opposite side of the street from the junction markers. </seg>

            <seg id="p075">DEPARTMENT OP PUBLIC WORKS 73 STATE HIGHWAY MAINTENANCE As previously stated the 1925 Session of the State Legislature passed a law making it the duty of the Department of Public Works to maintain the whole of the State Highway System including Bridges thereon. This act became effective January 1st, 1926. Financing was provided for by setting aside 30% of all motor vehicle registration fees and such part of the Gas Tax as was found to be necessary. The Maintenance organization is under the Bureau of Roads and Bridges, the Ass't Chief of Bureau being directly charged with full responsibility since the office of State Maintenance Engineer has not been established. The state is divided into eight districts each in charge of a District Engineer who has charge of both construction and maintenance within his district. Each district is divided into patrol districts made up of from one to three counties in charge of a resi - dent engineer who has direct charge of all maintenance and con - struction wtihin his district or a chief patrolman who is responsible only for maintenance. These men hire all patrolmen and extra labor and are held responsible for results obtained. All fuel, lubricants, repairs and emergency materials are pur - chased by the Chief Patrolmen, while equipment such as maintainers and tractors are purchased through the Lincoln office. All payrolls are made up in the district office from daily reports sent in by the patrolmen and extra laborers. A cost distribution sheet is also made for each man showing the amount chargeable to the different classes of work performed during the month. Material and supply vouchers are made up by each dealer from whom material has been purchased. These are forwarded to the District office where they are checked and distribution made to the different classes of work. Both payrolls and material and supply vouchers are forwarded to the Lincoln office where they are checked and sent on to the Finance Department for payment. The cost distribution sheets are retained in the cost accounting department, where all records are transferred to tabulating machine cards which provides an easy and speedy method of distributing costs to the proper district, county, patrol and class of work. A performance record is also kept for each individual piece of equipment which gives at the end of the year the total hours used, miles operated, amount of fuel and lubricant used and repair charges. These cost records are valuable for the comparative cost of mainten- </seg>

Equipment records are used for ascertaining the most economical type and make of equipment to purchase. When the Department took charge of maintenance the following equipment was taken over which had been purchased from the "State Highway Fund;" 220 one to five ton Trucks, 376 graders and main - tainers, 113 tractors, 60 one man maintainers. The following new equipment has been purchased during the year of 1926: 10 trucks, 116 graders and maintainers, 39 tractors, 141 one man maintainers, 43 weed mowers, 2 complete pressure sand blast and paint spray out - fits and 900,000 lineal feet of slat snow fence. The total cost of maintenance this year will be slightly under $2,000,000.00. All details of expenditures will be reported in the biennial report of 1927-1928. In view of the fact that it was necessary to build up an organiza - tion within a very limited time, the Bureau is very much gratified with results obtained during the past year of State Control of Maintenance. </seg>

Federal Aid was obtained for grading, building drainage structures and applying a gravel surface from Plattsmouth north to the Platte River, the last gap to be closed between the Kansas line south of Falls City and the Platte River north of Plattsmouth. State Federal Aid Project 15:5- A Note Gravel Surfacing under construction with windrows on left not all spread During the biennium a total of about thirty-five miles of gravel surfacing was placed on the State Highway System within the county, and about thirteen miles brought to permanent grade with suitable drainage structures. The gravel surfacing was financed from State and Federal funds together with county and precinct funds and some donations by private parties of the communities benefited by the Improvement. Fillmore County The construction of gravel surfacing in Fillmore County began in 1925 during which season the D. L. D. Highway, now U. S. Highway No. 38, was graveled across the county except about two and one - fourth miles east of Fairmont and one mile west of Fairmont. The delay in placing gravel near Fairmont was caused by lack of right - of-way for the new locations desired in that vicinity. </seg>
            <seg id="p079">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 77 \ The 1926 construction consisted of building drainage structures, grading and placing gravel on the remainder of the D. L. D. Highway. This work follows a new location each side of Fairmont whereby two right angle turns and two railroad grade crossings of the main line of the Burlington are eliminated. These new locations were made possible through the co-operation of the local people and County Board with the State and Federal road authorities. In addition to the above work contract was awarded for drainage structures and grading of the Meridian Highway, U. S. No. 81, from Geneva to the North county line, as well as gravel surfacing from Geneva to Fairmont. During the season the structures were built, about one-half of the grading completed by the county as contractor, and about one-third of the gravel contract completed. In addition to the work done on the State Highway System a gravel street and road was built from the Meridian Highway through Geneva and out to the Geneva Girls' Training School. Within the city State funds were used to supplement those of the local Improve - ment District and outside the city State funds were used alone. The expenditure was made under the provisions of the appropriation which set aside from the Gas Tax $25,000 per year for the years of 1925 and 1926 for the purpose of placing gravel surface on roads from State Institutions to State Highways. Gage County During the years of 1925 and 1926 the gravel road program was carried forward in Gage County and four times as much mileage of gravel placed as during the preceding biennium. At the close of the present biennium Wymore is connected with gravel north to meet Lancaster County gravel from Lincoln and Filley is connected with the gravel roads of Jefferson and Thayer counties to Hebron. In addition to the gravel program, the 1924 contract from Beatrice to Blue Springs was completed in 1925 and the state highway was graded from Wymore to the Kansas line and work begun on Ne - braska Highway No. 4 through Virginia at the close of the biennium. A relocation has been made through Virginia following the abandoned right-of-way of the old Kansas City and Northwestern Railway, which gives better view in the vicinity of the Rock Island depot and grade crossing, as well as natter curves. Also the system was shortened one mile at Rockford by eliminating the mile west on the south side of Rockford and making the connection north on the east side of Rockford. The Adams-Clatonia road east and west across the northern part of the county as well as the road north from Adams to the Lancaster County line are a part of the Federal Seven Per Cent System. </seg>
            <seg id="p080">78 REPORT OF SECRETARY I Maintenance of these roads was begun by the State In Janaury of 1926. During the summer the worst places have been graded up with teams and side ditches cut with a tractor and blade grader along the portions which had not previously been built up by the county. In addition to the work done on the state highways by the State, about two-thirds of a mile of gravel surface was built south from the State Institute pavement one mile east of Beatrice to Nebraska Highway No. 3 or Golden Rod. On this the grading was done by Gage County. Jefferson County During the biennium gravel road construction has been continued in Jefferson County and now Nebraska Highway No. 3 is graveled across the county through Fairbury. During 1926 Nebraska Highway No. 15 was graded and small drainage structures and bridges built from the junction of Highways No. 3 and No. 15 north of Fairbury to the north county line. With the completion of this construction the entire mileage of the State Highway System in Jefferson County has been brought to permanent grade and structures built. This is the first county of the group now in District One in which all the state highway has been brought to permanent grade. During the last two years considerable road gravel has been produced along the Blue River in Jefferson County for state roads within the county as well as in neighboring counties for surfacing. New pits have been developed to supplement the inadequate supply from the old pits and meet the new demand. Johnson County Gravel road construction was begun in Johnson County in the spring of 1926, at which time gravel was placed from Tecumseh through Vesta to Crab Orchard. This project was graded in 1920 and 1921. During 1926 contract was let for small structures, one bridge and grading from Nemaha County line due west to a point 2.75 miles north of the west side of Tecumseh. At the close of the construction season about 40% of this work will be done. The completion of the remainder of the State Highway System in Johnson County will involve relocations at Crab Orchard to obtain better alignment and from Sterling to Tecumseh to shorten distance </seg>

Lancaster County The mileage of the State Highway System in Lancaster County is greater than in any other county in District One. This is on ac - count of the many state highways which lead into Lincoln as well as on account of the size of the county. At the close of the present biennium we have slightly more than 70% of the state highway system within the county surfaced, which consists of 12.47 miles of brick or asphalt paving and 69.63 miles of gravel surface. Slightly over 91% of the system has been brought to permanent grade, leaving only 10.3 miles to be graded and per - manent drainage structures built where they have not already been constructed. During the years 1925 and 1926 gravel surfacing was placed on Nebraska Highway No. 33 from the Cornhusker Highway west to the county line towards Crete; and on XT. S. Highway No. 77 from Have - lock to the north county line. East "O" Street, Nebraska Highway No. 11 has been graded and drainage structures built from Lincoln to the east county line, except in the vicinity of the grade crossing of the Missouri Pacific Railway just east of Bethany where an under - pass is planned, one-half mile of asphalt pavement laid and gravel surface placed on the remainder. The city of Bethany and Lancaster County have built Cotner Boulevard from East "O" Street northeast to Bethany. The boule - vard has been extended north and northeast from Bethany to Have - lock, using city improvement district, state and federal funds. The combined project makes a new route for the Lincoln-Omaha road leaving Lincoln, whereby a number of right angle turns are eliminated and the larger business districts of University Place and Havelock avoided in lieu of the smaller business district of Bethany now traversed by the new route. </seg>

            <seg id="p083">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 81 When the new numbering of the highway system was adopted the Lincoln-Nebraska City Road, Nebraska Highway No. 24, was routed through College View, Cheney, Palmyra, Syracuse and to Nebraska City. To date the east three miles in Lancaster County have not been brought to a permanent grade on account of lack of construction funds but after the maintenance of the system was assumed by the State in 1926 maintenance funds were used to place this short stretch in sufficiently good condition that it is now open for travel. Gravel surface was placed by the State on grades prepared by the county from the State Hospital to the State Reformatory and from University Place east to one of the State Experimental Farms, a total combined distance of three and two-thirds miles in both projects. The State expenditure was made from the $25,000 per year appropri - ated from the Gas Tax for the years of 1925 and 1926 to construct gravel surface to connect State Institutions with the State High - ways. Nemaha County During the present biennium the state continued the previous program in Nemaha County by grading and building drainage struc - tures from Johnson west to the Johnson County line, which com - pleted the grading of the Golden Rod Highway in the county. The Rohrs-Johnson project, a 1924 contract, was completed in the spring of 1925, which was the same type of improvement as the above. In 1925 the graveling of the state highways was begun on the K. T. and completed early in 1926. The contractor made use of the local material, crushing the oversize to obtain material to meet the grading required in the specifications. A ■ satisfactory surface has been obtained, particularly south of Auburn. The first application on the north three and one-quarter miles was taken from a pit north - west of Auburn and this was finished with material hauled from a pit northwest of Nebraska City. The balance of the material for the project was hauled from a pit southwest of Auburn, which portion has proved to be the best of the project. In 1926 gravel surfacing was placed from the end of the con - crete pavement west of Auburn to Rohrs, using washed gravel from Platte River pits. While the roadbed is not absorbing this gravel very fast the surface has been very good since a short time after the gravel was hauled. There remains four miles of the highway system to be graded and structures built and 12.14 miles of surfacing to be placed in order to complete the 38.11 miles of state highways in the county. </seg>
            <seg id="p084">82 REPORT OF SECRETARY Otoe County In the spring of 1925 field investigations were made to determine available supplies of local gravel for the project from Dunbar to Syracuse. Construction was begun on this late in the fall of 1925, at which time only one-half the contract thickness was placed over a part of the project, but the two towns were connected with surfacing before the contractor stopped for the winter. Early in 1926 the re - mainder of the surface was placed, using a small amount of Platte River gravel to complete as the local supply of satisfactory material was depleted in that locality. In 1926 contract was let for grading and drainage structures from Syracuse west to meet the Federal Aid Projects completed west of Unadilla and contracts were awarded for gravel surfacing from Syracuse to the corner one-half mile west of Palmyra. The grading project west from Syracuse involves a relocation at Syracuse going north on the east side of the town and west at the next section corner in order to eliminate several right-angle turns. From Wolf Creek to Unadilla the road follows the north side of the Burlington track on a relocation which eliminates two grade cross - ings. North of Unadilla the new project continues due north two - miles to meet the section line east from south of Cheney and north of Palmyra, thence west and thus makes one right angle turn instead of three. At the close of the biennium there remains three miles of the system to be constructed to grade and drainage structures to be built and nine miles of gravel surface to be placed in order to complete the system in the county. Pawnee County In 1925 State Highway No. 4 was graded and drainage structures built from Lewiston west to the Gage County line. High fills were constructed between deep cuts through the hills and very satisfactory gradients were obtained. The same year gravel surfacing was begun at Pawnee City and constructed from a point about three-quarters of a mile south of Table Rock to about four miles west of Pawnee City. In the spring of 1926 the contract was completed making a total of 15.75 miles of gravel surfacing on State Highway No. 4, in Pawnee County. Late in the summer of 1926 work was begun on drainage struc - tures and grading from the Richardson County line to the drainage - ditch east of Table Rock. The completion of these contracts will effect an improvement through the steepest hills on the highway system in Pawnee County. </seg>

            <seg id="p086">84 REPORT OF SECRETARY Richardson County Late In the season of 1925 the placing of gravel surface was begun on the K. T. Highway, U. S. No. 73, through the eastern portion of Richardson County. This work was completed about mid-summer of 1926. Local material from a bank north of Salem was used to construct the surface in the south half of the county, except 1.5 miles just south of Falls City, and also for one-half the depth of the surface in the north half of the county. The north end was completed with shipped in washed gravel. To date the section built with a base course of local gravel covered with washed gravel has been the most popular with the local people. Early in 1926 an experimental section of 1.5 miles length just south of Falls City was constructed of crushed Nebraska limestone spread three inches deep and compacted by traffic the same as gravel surfaces are compacted in this State. This material compacted very readily and made a satisfactory surface until dry weather, at which time the fine stone dust was whipped off the surface by wind and traffic. After construction of a 100 foot bridge on U. S. Highway No. 75 north of Dawson in 1924, using State-Federal funds, the State and County placed patrol maintenance on this highway north and south across the central portion of the county in 1925 and the state con - tinued the maintenance with its own forces in 1926. During 1926 a steel and concrete bridge was built across the Nemaha River just south of Dawson, where an old steel rainbow arch failed during the spring freshets. A new bridge with channel changes and a straightening of the Highway was constructed at Whiskey Run Creek about five miles north of Dawson. This improvement added greatly to the safety of the highway at this point. Saline County At the beginning of the biennium there was gravel surfacing in Saline County from Dorchester to Friend and less than a mile east from Crete. At the close of the biennium there is a gravel road across the County through Crete and Friend, from Dorchester to the north County line and from Wilber to Crete. The work during this biennium included a second application late in 1925 of two inches on top of the gravel placed between Friend and Dorchester in 1924.

This constitutes the road constructed to a temporary grade as reported in the table showing mileage of state highways in District One. The ten miles of unimproved road is from this highway due west of Wilber to the Fillmore County line southeast of Milligan. Sarpy County The construction of gravel roads was begun in Sarpy County in 1924 and at the close of 1926 they have gravel surface on practically all of the state highway system within the county. During the present biennium the grading, structures and gravel surface have been constructed from Melia through Gretna to the Douglas County line north of Gretna; from Gretna east to within about three miles of Papillion together with the connection south of State-Federal Aid Project No. 138- A New relocation shortening distance and eliminating sharp, dangerous, blind corner. Millard near Chalco to the Gretna-Papillion road; from a point a mile east of Papillion to the Douglas County line near Ralston and to Fort Crook, except about three-quarters of a mile on the latter road.

This money was expended on 81.25 miles of roads within the respective precincts and improvement districts. Of this total mileage, approximately 43 miles is on the state highway system, on thirty-seven miles of which either or both state and federal funds were used jointly with the bond funds voted by the local communities served. The remainder of the roads improved with the bond funds are county or precinct roads. Saunders County For the convenience and economy of administration by the De - partment of Public Works, the D. L. D. Highway, U. S. No. 38, through Ashland is included in District One. No construction work was done on this portion of the system during the present biennium, all ex - penditures being confined to maintenance. The report on Saunders County will be found in the report on District No. 2. Thayer County At the beginning of the biennium the last gap on Highway No. 3 across the county was graded and structures built. This was a short project east of Deshler. During the winter of 1925 and 1926 and early summer of 1926 gravel surface was placed on No. 3 from Hebron to the east county line, and now Hebron is connected with Lincoln and Omaha by a surfaced highway. Local material, some pumped from the Blue River near Hebron and some taken from dry banks, was used for this surfacing. At the close of the biennium the Meridian Highway, U. S. No. 81, from Hebron to the Kansas line is under construction. When com - pleted, practically all of the state highway system in the county will have been constructed to permanent grade and structures built ready for gravel surfacing. This will make it possible to use practically all of the funds available during the next biennium for gravel surfacing. </seg>

State Highway No. 15 carries the traffic to Lincoln and southern parts via Seward and State Highway No. 16 carries the traffic to Omaha and the east via Yutan Bridge and Center Street in Douglas County. During the Biennium, State Highway No. 15 has been graveled from Colfax County line to David City and is being graded from David City south towards the county line to David City and graveled from David City to the Polk County line. The soil on Highway No. 15 varies from loess in the hills to sandy loam in the Platte River bottom and oc Highway No. 16 the soil is mostly loess with outcrops of joint clay. The entire system is easily maintained and the drainage problems have not been intricate as the streams are mostly sluggish. Due to the fact that all the railroads traversing this county are branch lines, no attempt has been made to separate grade crossings. M. F.

Both of these highways have bus and truck lines plying to Co - lumbus and Omaha as well as Lincoln and due to the tonnage hauled and the prevalence of hard tires, the roads are very difficult to maintain. U. S. Highway No. 38, being located in the Platte valley has a soil varying from sand to gumbo and state Highway No. 15 varies from sand and gumbo in the bottoms to loess in the hills. U. S. Highway No. 38 has been constructed from the Dodge County line to the Platte county line and has been surfaced with travel and presents an excellent appearance as well as riding qualities. One mile of State Highway No. 15 has been paved and the major part across the county has been graded and with a small amount of work in the valleys, this will be ready for gravel surfacing. The entire system has been maintained with one man tractor patrols and considering the traffic and type of soils the highways have been In very good shape during the past biennium. Considerable study has been made on the grade crossings within this county and with the new relocation on the north side of the main line of the Union Pacific railroad, two dangerous grade crossings havR been eliminated. While this improvement was met with much opposition in Schuyler and Richland by the townspeople and the merchants on the start, they now feel that the elimination has been an asset rathei than a liability. Snow removal has been carried on with the regular patrol forcei during the past biennium and the roads have never been closed oi impassable and with the use of the snow fence purchased recently, th« snow hazard will be reduced to a minimum. </seg>

The soils encountered on each of these highways varies from sand and heavy gumbo in the Platte and Elkhorn valleys to loess and sandy loam in the hills, each of which present a problem in maintenance and construction. Highway No. 8 is paved from the Douglas County line to the north city limits of Fremont and being improved to the Cumlng County line. No. 18 has been given a light coat of gravel from Fremont east. No. 30 has been paved from Fremont to Ames and graveled in sec - tions westerly to the Colfax County line and No. 77 has been paved from the Saunders county line northerly to the south city limits of Fremont and graded and graveled to its northern terminus. The maintenance of the earth and gravel sections due to the diver - sified types of soil has been a problem to handle, each soil demanding a different type of maintenance and different equipment. Considerable paving is contemplated to the west of Ames this season and with the relocation of the highway to the north of the Union Pacific Railroad from Ames west to 4 % miles east of North Bend, much of the danger of these railroad crossings will be eliminated and the distance of the highway will be shortened and alignment straightened. Snow removal has been carried on with truck and tractor and by our regular patrol forces, and at no time have the roads been im - passable or closed and with the recent purchase of snow fence sup - planting the fence already on hand the expensive problem of snow removal will be reduced to a minimum. </seg>

With the installation of snow fence purchased this year with tho use of that which we have already on hand and being equipped for any emergency that may arise no trouble is contemplated. Polk County Highways maintained by the State Highway Department in Polk County includes U. S. Highway No. 81 extending from the York County line to the Platte County line. State Highway No. 38 extending west and northerly from Osceola towards Genoa and State Highway No. 16 extending from the Butler County line to the Hamilton County line. A new and better location is contemplated for State Highway No. 16 and this has been sanctioned by the Bureau of Public Roads as this contemplates a shorter distance between Osceola and U. S. Highway No. 38 and a better stream crossing over the Platte River at Clarks. The soil is an excellent type to construct and maintain but due to a series of low lagoons without outlets, water has been a source of considerable trouble in our maintenance program. U. S. Highway No. 81 has been graveled from York County line to Shelby and State Highway No. 16 has been graveled from Shelby east to the Butler County line during the past biennium. No work has been done on State Highway No. 16 west of Stroms - burg or on State Highway No. 38 from Osceola to Genoa on account of relocations and insufficient funds. The maintenance has been carried on with truck and tractor patrols supplanted by such extra teams and labor required. </seg>

Sannders County The highways included in the State Highway Department program are State Highway No. 16 extending from the Douglas County line to the Butler County line and U. S. Highway No. 77 extending from the Lancaster County line northerly to the Dodge County line. During the biennium the State Highway No. 16 has been graded and graveled with Federal and State funds from the Douglas County line to Wahoo and from Western west to Butler County line. Included in this improvement is the Yutan State Aid Bridge between Douglas and Saunders counties. State Highway No. 16 has divided the traffic from U. 6. Highways No. 30 and 38 which had become congested. In the near future it is expected that through traffic will equal either of the U. S. Highways. The maintenance has been carried on with truck and tractor out - fits located at Wahoo, Cedar Bluffs and Yutan and the work has been very successful.

The snow removal has been taken care of during the past biennium by the regular patrols and such other help as needed and at no time have the roads been closed or impassable. The judicious use of snow fence in this county has reduced the expense to a minimum and with the further use of new fence purchased this year, snow hazard will be practically removed. Seward County The highways included in the State Highway Department program for the biennium ending December 31st, 1926 are U. S. Highway No. 38 and State Highways No. 11 and No. 15, each of which are of more than local importance. U. S. Highway No. 38 and State Highway No. 11 extend east and west through the county, while State Highway No. 15 traverses the county north and south. The soil of this county is such that no difficulty is experienced in maintenance and when surfaced with a proper amount of gravel has the appearance and riding qualities of a paved road. Extensive gravel deposits exist in the southern part of the county in and along the Blue River and are being used locally for surfacing but the major part of our surfacing gravel comes from the Platte River east and north. During the biennium State Highway No. 15 was graveled from a point four miles north of Milford to the York County line, and U. S. Highway No. 30 was graded from Milford to the Saline County line and graveled from Lancaster County line to the Saline County line, completing two east and west roads across the county and with the close of 1926 plans will be completed to grade and gravel the section from Seward north to the Butler County line completing the 7% system in this community. The maintenance within this county during the past biennium has tn carried on with truck and tractor patrols using one man regular - and employing such extra help as was needed and was very successful.

Washington County The highways maintained by the State Highway Department in Washington County include State Highways No. 5 and 31 extending North and South through the county and State Highway No. 18 ex - tends east and west, each of which are subjected to heavy truck traffic due to their proximity to Omaha. During the past biennium State Highway No. 5 has been graveled from Douglas County to Burt County line and five miles of state Highway No. 18 has been graded and major drainage structures com - pleted and State Highway No. 31 has been bladed. The soil varies from gumbo in the bottoms to loess in the hills and due to the erosions creeping back from the river it has been difficult to maintain.

The county through their maintenance funds has contributed to gravel construction in this county and through their aid, that section of No. 5 from Blair northerly has been graveled. Concrete paving has been built by City and Federal Aid through the villages of Ft. Calhoun and Herman and this no doubt will be a nucleus of future surface developments. The maintenance has been carried on with truck and tractor patrols and has been very efficient. No grade crossing elimination has been planned for this county as all the crossings are near towns and on branch railroads. Snow removal has been taken care of by the regular patrol forces with heavy equipment and at no time have the highways been closed. The purchase of additional snow fence together with that which was purchased in previous years, bids fair to reduce the snow hazard to a minimum. </seg>

Highway No. 81, which extends from north to south across the county and State Highway No. 11 which extends from east to west. The entire state highway system, within the county has been completed during the past biennium and York County roads stand preeminently among the best maintained highways within the district. Local gravel has been found near York but is only of value to those roads within a short radius of the pits since the major part of the gravel used in construction and maintenance has come from the. Flatte and Blue Rivers lying to the east and the south. The soil for the most part is of exceptional quality with which! to build and maintain roads and the drainage problems are not in - tricate and due to the gentle rolling land the construction costs have been reduced to the minimum. Grade crossings have been eliminated at Bradshaw and alarms requested at York and the railroad promises immediate action in the installation. Snow removal has been taken care of with the patrol forces and! heavy equipment and with recent purchases of snow fence no further difficulty is anticipated. </seg>

This County also has a north and south Highway, being No. 14, which runs through the County from Neligh to the south County line. Extensive improvement has been made in Antelope County's Highways during this biennium. At the end of the last biennium the County had 12 miles of graveled roads. It now boasts of one road. No. 8, which is graveled entirely across the County and it also has six miles of graveled road from Neligh to the south making a total of 37 miles of graveled Highways. In addition to the above improvements, U. S. Highway No. 20 has been constructed to permanent grade from Orchard to Bruns - wick a distance of 13 miles. Many miles of this project had to be clay surfaced as the northern part of Antelope County is sandy in parts. Local gravel pits fortunately located have made gravel construc - tion particularly economical in this County. Gravel testing as low as 30% on a No. 10 screen and seldom higher than 50% on a No. 10 screen has been used with excellent results. Nearness of the gravel has made it possible to gravel considerable mileage as a main - tenance feature. The maintenance in Antelope County has been very good at all times. In spite of the fine gravel used in the gravel construction in this County, very little maintenance gravel has been necessary as this fine material has withstood the effects of a medium traffic excellently. Replacements will be necessary on portions of Highway No. 8 during the coming biennium. A new bridge across the Elkhorn river between Clearwater and Neligh including advantageous straightening of the alignment ad - jacent to the bridge has been an outstanding improvement. A short project east of Oakdale to eliminate two dangerous railroad crossings has also been a decided improvement, appreciated by all who use this highway. Boone County The highway system of Boone County consists of Highway No. 14 which crosses the County north and south and Highway No. 32 which extends from Albion northeast to the County line and to Madison where it connects with U. S. Highway No. 81. During this biennium a very visible improvement has been made throughout this County. From the south County line to a point three </seg>
            <seg id="p104">102 REPORT OF SECRETARY miles north of Albion, gravel surfacing has been placed, a distance of about sixteen and one-half miles, all being placed during this blennlum except one mile was previously graveled. Highway No. 14 north of Albion for about five miles in the vicinity of Loretta is subjected to severe washes caused by filling and silting in of ditches and subsequent overflowing. Before this portion is graveled it will be necessary to rebuild the grades, making them higher throughout and to provide larger drainage structures. From Albion to the east County line on Highway No. 32, earth - work construction has been completed and this highway is now ready for gravel construction. In fact the entire system in Boone County is now graded with sixteen and one-half miles also graveled. During this biennium, particularly during 1926, Boone County maintenance costs have been increased due to bad washouts caused by unusual rains. On one occasion incompleted Projects 207-A, 207-B and 83-B were all washed out in several places, making it necessary to detour traffic. The grades were rebuilt and bridges back-filled by reconstruction crews. Old settlers stated that they could not recall a time when so much water fell in so short an interval. Bart County Burt County is crossed by two very important through highways and these in turn are fed by secondary State Federal Highways which make a very advantageous network within this County, serving local farm to market traffic and through traffic as well. XT. S. Highway No. 77 crosses the County north and south and Highway No. S from Omaha connects' with it at Oakland. Highway No. 9 starts from No. 77 west of Oakland and affords a connection with No. 8 to the west at West Point. No. 51 from Pender, via Bancroft connecting with No. 77 north of Lyons and crossing the county to Decatur and running thence south to Tekamah passes through a good farming country throughout its length and affords an excellent outlet for marketing the produce of this section. Harked improvements have been made during this biennium. Gravel surfacing has been placed from the south county line via Tekamaha to Oakland and from Tekamah to Decatur. Contracts have been let for graveling and grading from Oakland to the north county line and when completed, there will be a continuous gravel road from Sioux City to Omaha. This is a heavy traffic road both in volume and weight of traffic. Twelve large passenger busses main - tain a regular schedule and freight trucks are numerous. </seg>
            <seg id="p105">DEPARTMENT OP PUBLIC WORKS 103 Local gravel deposits north, south and west of Tekamah have been a boon to a gravel road program and the nearness of the local ma - terial has made this type of surfacing economical. The deposits north of Tekamah contain very fine material which is mixed with just enough damp clay to cause difficulty in screening. For this rea - son poor progress has resulted but by patient, untiring work, it has been possible to produce specification material and thus take advant - age of the native deposit. Close cooperation and good understanding with the County Board and the various communities has made for unhampered progress and marked improvements. Cedar County Located in Cedar County is the only bridge across the Missouri river for many miles up and down the river. Consequently this is a very important crossing and the traffic converges to this point. Highway No. 15, a part of the Omaha-Yankton Highway, crosses the county north and south for its full length. During the past two years, this highway, from Fordyce to the Yankton bridge, has been con - structed. Formerly sandy, hilly and with a very steep narrow and winding approach to the Missouri river bottom, the construction of this road has been a notable improvement. Because the Yankton bridge is a toll bridge, the Federal Bureau refused participation in the construction of the highway leading to it and for that reason, all state* funds were used in this construction. Gravel has been placed from Laurel to the south county line making a continuous gravel road from Fordyce to Laurel and to Omaha except for nine miles in Wayne County, which will be graveled next year. The Yankton bridge also provides a crossing for the Meridian Highway, being U. S. No. 81, which crosses Cedar County for five miles adjacent to the bridge. This stretch of road was blade graded during this biennium and a good temporary grade prepared for the traffic. Much improvement in alignment, to eliminate sharp corners, is anticipated when construction of this road is undertaken. </seg>

Highway No. 20 will be started in this county. The relocation of highway No. 15 at Fordyce to the north side of the track in order to eliminate two dangerous railroad crossings and three turns is an important short project that is planned for 1927 construction. Cunming County Cuming County has four State-Federal Highways, which are so located as to take care of both the local and through traffic very admirably. Highway No. 8 affords an Omaha connection and runs west through the County from West Point. Highway No. 15 from Wisner north to the County line is a part of the Omaha to Yankton route. There is also Highway No. 9 which runs from West Point east to a connection with U. S. Highway No. 77 and north from West Point through an excellent farming country to Pender and points be - yond making a connection with the Sioux City Highway at Emerson. Another excellent connection was made a part of the "seven per cent" system during this biennium when the road from Pender to Ban - croft and east to connect V. S. Highway No. 77 north of Lyons was made a State-Federal Highway.

In addition to this, Highway No. 15 from Wisner north to the County line, a distance of 7 miles, has been constructed and is being graveled as is the 2 miles on the Wayne, Cuming County line. This closes the gap and provides a gravel road from Wayne to Omaha. A contract has been let for the construction of grades and drainage structures on about 12 miles of Highway No. 9 from Pender north to the Bancroft road and this is now under construction. A new creosoted gum floor has also been placed on the Wisner State Aid bridge during this biennium. Wisner State Aid Bridge Note seasoned, creosoted, black gumwood floor </seg>

            <seg id="p109">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 107 Local gravel deposits in the Western part of the county have been opened up and have made It possibble to construct gravel roads quite economically. The soil from which Highway No. 8 is built, was for the most part very difficult to maintain as an earth road but graveling has solved the problem to a large extent and an excellent road has re - sulted. The soil on the other Highways is quite easily maintained and a good surface for travel has been kept at all times. The traffic through this County is very heavy on Highway No. 8 as it carries through traffic and is subjected to considerable local hauling. It traverses a great cattle feeding country. Dakota County Dakota County, adjacent to Sioux City, is situated, in the neck of a bottle, one might say, as all traffic from the Nebraska side to Sioux City, a great market center, must pass through Dakota County to the Missouri River Bridge. U. S. Highway No. 77 crosses the County north and south in the east part of the county and U. S. Highway No. 20 crosses east to the west along -the north part of the County. Highway No. 35 crosses diagonally between the above two, from the northeast corner of the county to the southwest corner. It will be apparent therefore that all traffic converges toward the northeast corner and the routing of these important highways is such that they very ably care for all local traffic as well as for the through traffic. During this biennium U. S. Highway No. 77 has been graveled en - tirely across the County except for two miles, previously graveled. On U. S. Highway No. 20 all of the grades from Jackson to South Sioux City were prepared for graveling by State and County forces ex - cept two miles. These two miles of grading, together with the neces - sary drainage structures, and gravel for all of the distance from Jack - son to South Sioux City have been contracted and work is in pro- On both Highway No. 20 and No. 35 excellent routing has been possible due to complete cooperation of the County. Heavy bus traffic and heavy freighting, both long distance and farm to market, coupled with a heavy automobile traffic are a cause of difficult maintenance throughout this county. As the roads leading into here are improved and consequently increases the traffic even more than at present. It will be necessary from an economical stand - point to consider hard surfaced roads for this County. </seg>
            <seg id="p110">108 REPORT OF SECRETARY Dixon County With portions of the County very hilly, Dixon County presents quite a problem in road building. It is faced with routing the high - ways through the hills, thus making excessive grades or especially heavy construction, or with routing the highways in the foothills where they are subject to severe washing from side hill drainage and conse - quent silting of ditches. In spite of this however, some very good routes have been located and several good stretches of highways have been constructed during this biennium. Dixon County is crossed north and south by Highway No. 9 and is crossed east and west in the northern part of the County by U. S. Highway No. 20 and in the south part of the county by Highway No. 35 which was added to the State-Federal system during this biennium. From Ponca to Martinsburg has been graveled during the past two years. State-Federal Aid Project Xo. 270-A Ready to Market Nebraska's Corn Crop Composed of a soil which cuts badly and is very heavy when wet, the graveling of this portion has been an outstanding improvement. Located as it is in the foothills with a stream crossing and recrossing It, this road has been subject to severe washes and the ditches are con - stantly filling with silt from the adjacent hills. The maintenance </seg>
            <seg id="p111">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 109 has therefore been difficult and has consisted of constant ditch clean - ing. The road being graveled has made it difficult to dispose of the material taken from the ditches as this was formerly bladed up into the grade before the gravel was placed. Undoubtedly it will be neces - sary to. regrade this project before another application of gravel is placed, at which time the grades should be built high troughout and larger drainage structures should be provided so as to take off the flood waters practically unchecked and consequently avoid the filling of ditches and consequent over flow. A local gravel deposit at Martinsburg was used to gravel the above project. This is the only deposit yet found in the County containing satisfactory material and its supply is quite limited. Prom Allen to Waterbury on Highway No. 20 an excellent grading project was constructed during this biennium. By routing this High - way parallel to the railroad it was found possible to avoid many turns and the grades were reduced by avoiding numerous steep hills. This involved the buying of right of way in which the County cooperated. All of the highways not constructed to permanent grade have been temporarily graded, so that all are in fair condition for travel in spite of the hills which are quite steep and frequent in places. The cooperation of the County has been excellent at all times which has helped very materially in the progress of the construction and maintenance of this county. Madison County Madison County with four State and Federal Highways has the greatest population of any County in Northeast Nebraska. This county has U. S. Highway No. 81, known as the Meridian Highway crossing it from the north to south and has State Highway No. 8 across its entire length from east to west. In addition it has State Highway No. 35 leading to Sioux City. This Highway was approved by the Federal Bureau during this biennium and made a part of the seven percent system. Highway No. 32 starting at Madison, the County seat, crosses the County to the west passing through a very rich farming country and affords an excellent market road to that part of the county. Extensive progress has been made in this County during the past two years on the State Highway system. U. S. Highway No. 81 is graveled entirely across the county north and south and State High - way No. 8 is graveled entirely across the county east and west. In addition to this a road from Norfolk to the State Hospital has been graveled, 1 mile of this being on State Highway No. 35. This gives </seg>
            <seg id="p112">110 REPORT OF SECRETARY Madison County 54 miles of gravelled highways, 28 miles of which were graveled during this biennium. During the past two years there has also been constructed 13 miles ot permanent grade between Madi - son and the west county line on Highway No. 32, permanent grade from Meadow Grove to Tilden, and permanent grade for 2.5 miles north and for 2.5 miles east of Norfolk. It will be noted therefore that many miles of the Highways of this county were both graded and later graveled during this biennium. It is to be noted that every mile of State Highway in this county which has been built to permanent grade, has also been graveled ex - cept the project between Madison and Newman Grove on which the contract for permanent grading was awarded during the later part of the biennium. "State-Federal Aid Project No. 207-C Soil conditions in Madison County vary to such extent that one mile of Highway is sometimes composed of three or four different soils, a fact that in the past has made good maintenance expensive and difficult. Graveling however has been very successful and has been instrumental in relieving this condition to a great degree. The end of this beinnium finds Madison county roads in excellent condition for all year round travel. A fine spirit of cooperation has existed between the County officials. city officials, chamber of Commerce, and the Department and the highly successful program which has been carried out in this county can be largely attributed to this cooperative and progressive spirit. </seg>
            <seg id="p113">DEPARTMENT OP PUBLIC WORKS 111 The county roads, too of Madison County have been developed on a systematic basis making a fine network of county roads connecting with State Highways and insuring a good market road to each market center in the county. Located one mile north and one mile east of Norfolk on a graveled road, built with State Highway funds, is the Norfolk State Hospital for insane. This institution including improvements and buildings cost approximately $2,500,000 and is said to be one of the best insti - tutions of its kind in the United States. Surrounded by well kept grounds and a model farm, this institution is a small town by itself with a population, including inmates and employes, totalling nearly 900 people. Pierce County With only two Highways through the County, it is notable that Pierce County is crossed both north to south and east to west by an important interstate route. Highway No. 20 with origin at Boston, Massachusetts, and objective at Astoria, Washington, crosses the county from east to west. The Meridian Highway, from Mexico City to Winnepeg, Canada, crosses it from south to north. During this biennium Highway No. 81 from Pierce south to the county line, a distance of approximately ten miles, has been graveled. Also Highway No. 20, from the west county line to the intersection with Highway No. 81, has been constructed, a distance of 16 miles. Being an east and west road subject to drifting snow, all fills were made from borrow pits to avoid cutting the knolls. An excellent all year road has resulted. About 5 miles of Highway No. 81 and about 9 miles of Highway No. 20 remain to be constructed but for the present an excellent tem - porary blade grader road has been built and has been in good condition Splendid cooperation has existed between the State, County and communities within the county. Stanton County State Highway No. 8 crosses this county east and west and State Highway No. 15 extends from Pilger south to the Stanton-Colfaz County line. This county now boasts of an excellent graveled road en - tirely across its length east and west, all of this graveling having been accomplished during this biennium. Highway No. 15 south from Pilger has a good temporary grade and being in a very rolling country. </seg>
            <seg id="p114">112 REPORT OF SECRETARY the drainage is good and well confined, so that under good mainten - ance it has been possible to keep this road in excellent condition. Local gravel deposits in the eastern part of the county have made gravel construction economical and was the means of accomplishing the completion of a larger construction program than otherwise would have been possible with the more or less meagre finances of this county. In the western part of the county, local gravel deposits were discovered but consisted of a preponderance of fine aggregate making it necessary to supplement this material with a coarser material shipped in from the Platte River. Varying soil conditions on Highway No. 8 made its maintenance difficult in the past but gravel surfacing has proved very adaptable with the result that uniform maintenance of a very satisfactory nature is now being obtained. Due to the location of the Highway west of Stanton where it parallels the foothills and is subjected to severe washes and consequent filling of ditches, expensive reconstruction has been necessary fre - quently. It has been found that drainage ditches to the Elkhorn River on the south are practical without undue cost and plans are be - ing considered to cut such ditches and thus provide better drainage by means of which the above condition can be avoided. Cooperation of the Chicago and Northwestern Railroad Company, who^e tracks parallel the highway is being sought as they have the same problem of main - tenance. Thurston County Located close to Sioux City, Thurston County Highways particular - ly U. S. Highway No. 77 crossing the County north and south, are sub - ject to very severe traffic. Highway No. 77, a through route, carries the trafllc from the Cornhusker Highway and from the Washington Highway. During this biennium this Highway has been graveled or is under contract for its entire length through the county. All of the county's State-Federal funds for this biennium have been used for this pur - pose, thus, with the work under contract in Burt County, closing the gap between Sioux City and Omaha and making a continuous gravel road for the whole distance. The result is that much of the traffic that formerly went down the Iowa side to Omaha, now goes over Highway No. 77. In the western part of the county, Highway No. 9 runs from Pender to the county line and to West Point affording a connection with High- </seg>
            <seg id="p115">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 113 way No. 8 and from Pender west and north to Wakefleld. This road has been well maintained and in good condition at all times. During this biennium another State-Federal Highway has been added to the system in Thurston County. This is Highway No. 51 starting at Emerson where it connects with No. 35 to Sioux City and runs south through Pender and south and southeast from Pender to a connection north of Lyons with Highway No. 77 and continuing on to Decatur and Tekamah. The addition of this Highway gives an ex - cellent outlet from all towns in the county over a State Highway. Thurston County with two Indian Reservations makes an interest - ing picture for the tourist. Two tribes, the Winnebagoes and the Omahas are located here. On a bright warm day the Indians may be seen anywhere draped in their bright colored shawls or blankets, wear - ing moccasins, and bedecked with gaudy jewelry. In September of each year a great pow-wow is held consisting of feasting, Indian dances, Indian games, and rodeos. Tribes from all over the middle west take part and tourists from long distances visit the reservations during the festivals which last for several days. Wayne County Wayne County representing some of the best farming country in the State is crossed north and south by State Highway No. 15, the Omaha to Yankton road, and is crossed east and west by State High - way No. 35 which was added to the seven percent system during this biennium. This is the Norfolk to Sioux City Highway. The county also has State Highway No. 9 from Wakefield south to a point west of Pender. Highway No. 15 is constructed to permanent grade entirely across the County and is graveled from Wayne south to the County line. This Highway connects at Wisner with Highway No. 8 and the entire distance from Wayne to Omaha is now graveled or under contract for gravel, giving Wayne County an excellent all weather road to the State's metropolis. During the early part of the next biennium it is planned to gravel Highway No. 15 from Wayne north to the County line to connect with the gravel across Cedar County. Highway No. 35 has been constructed from the county line three miles west of Hoskins to a point two miles west of Winside. This Is an exceptionally heavy piece of construction and a notable improve - ment as portions of this project were relocated from the old traveled road to eliminate four railroad crossings, to shorten distance, to im - prove grades, and to reduce the snow conditions which, on the old loca - tion of the road, were a cause of serious and lengthy delays to traffic. </seg>
            <seg id="p116">114 REPORT OF SECRETARY I / Excellent soil conditions prevail throughout the county. The soil is particularly adapted for gravel surfacing and as a result the graveled road south of Wayne is in excellent condition. All of the State Highways in this County are constructed to per - manent grade or temporary grade, there being no unimproved State highways in the county. The temporary grades are blade grader sections for the most part with the low portions either graded up by casting in with elevator grader or by i'resno work. Good drainage structures have been provided even on temporary grades so that under careful maintenance the roads in this county are in very good condition at all times. REPORT OF DISTRICT FOUR F. C. Rolls, District Engineer IThe State Highways in this county are graveled completely. The &gt; inches on the D. L. D. was not sufficient for the heavy traffic and was necessary to add additional gravel in 1926. Considerable uble has been experienced in past winters with snow on the D.

            <seg id="p117">DEPARTMENT OP PUBLIC WORKS 115 Clay County The entire system in this county has been graded and graveled and ranks with the finest roads in the State. The soil is very good and the roads are easily maintained. The topography is flat to rolling with no drianage problems. One-man graders and a tractor and planer are used for maintaining. Greeley County Probably the heaviest piece of road grading in the State was done on the Greeley-Howard County line east of Wolbach. Yardage moved was approximately 30,000 per mile. Practically the whole State System runs through hilly country and construction is necessarily expensive. Greeley County has 23 miles of first class roads but on account of the great amount of grading yet to be done, no gravel has been started. </seg>
            <seg id="p118">116 REPORT OP SECRETARY Not an uncommon experience with any progressive highway department. The two views above show how one District Engineer and his patrol forces eliminated a dangerous and narrow wood bridge which was expensive to maintain and substituted a 36-inch corrugated pipe culvert under a 45-foot fill. The wooden trestle was 60-foot long and 30-foot high. The second view shows the 45-foot fill nearly com - pleted. A State Highway crosses the southwest corner of Greeley County through the "Chalk Hills." This road had practically no work done on it previous to this year. With state funds only we have made this a very good road, in one place making a fill of 45 feet. This is a very picturesque route, as it runs along the Loup Valley. Hall County Hall County now has 70.25 miles of well graded and graveled roads. Of this amount Hall County Supervisors, who have always been good road enthusiasts built thirty-five miles of gravel from their own surplus funds. Probably one of the biggest improvements in this county was the building of four steel and concrete bridges over the Platte River on the Grand Island-Hastings highway, a total length of 1040 feet. Highway constructing during the past two years consisted of the building and graveling of five miles, which completed the gap between Grand Island and Hastings. Also, eleven miles of as fine a road as is in the State was built on the Potash Highway closing the gap between the Lincoln highway gravel and the Buffalo County line. Part of this road runs thru low flat country and it was necessary to raise the grade above the surrounding country. </seg>
            <seg id="p119">DEPARTMENT OP PUBLIC WORKS 117 One Section of the Platte River Bridge, State-Federal Aid Project No. 215-A Total length consists of six 80 foot spans, one 80 foot span, three 80 foot spans, and three 80 foot spans all in different sections, 20 foot roadway. The Lincoln Highway across Hall County has a number of turns and two had railroad crossings. It is now proposed to eliminate both these features by constructing a new highway on the north side of the Union Pacific tracks, which will also save about seven miles in distance. Hamilton County At the end of 1924 this county only had 1.71 miles of gravel on the State System, but now has 41 miles leaving only 21 miles to complete the system. Hamilton County has probably as fine a soil as any county in the State. A feature of improvement was the building of eleven miles west of Aurora. This road always blocks with snow in the winter so the new road grades were raised to eliminate this trouble. Teams and one man graders are used for maintaining. Howard County This county has shown a decided improvement in the past two years. Twelve miles of gravel road was built on the Grand Island Highway, which not only connected up with Grand Ieland but also pro - tected an expensive clay surface. </seg>
            <seg id="p120">118 REPORT OF SECRETARY The road west of St. PanI is very hilly and was generally snow bound each winter. Nine miles of this has been improved and the road is open the year round. Howard county has still a large mileage to improve. Merrick County Considerable trouble and expense is encountered in building roads in this county on account of sandy and gumbo soil and low swampy ground. Twenty miles of road through this sort of country has just been completed with a twenty-eight foot roadway. As there is no chance to erect snow fence on account of being parallell to the railroad, it was necessary to raise grade the entire length rather than just through the low ground. Great difficulty was encountered finding suitable binding material for surfacing. The county supervisors have co-operated to the fullest extent in acquiring right of way for the road and clay pits. The construction of Project No. 278-B eliminated two dangerous railroad crossings on the Lincoln Highway. One-man graders and tractor and planer are used for maintaining. Maintenance is a problem in this county on ac - count of traffic and soil conditions. Nance County A great improvement has been made from Fullerton south to the Merrick County line as the result of building project No. 5 0-D. This formerly could hardly be called a road but since the lines have been straightened, grades raised and clayed and graveled, it now compares with the best in the State. Work is now in progress between Genoa and Fullerton where numerous grade crossings are being eliminated, also distance shortened and lines straightened. When this project is completed, it will be a decided improvement. Future work in this county will be expensive on account of heavy work in the hills. One-man graders are nsed for maintenance. Xuckolls County Graveling and grading in this county is completed with the ex - ception of eleven miles between the K. N. D. and the Webster County line. This is on a new location and will probably use up the next two years approtionment. Topography is rolling to hilly. Roads are com - paratively easily maintained and are always in fine condition. Floods on the Republican River near Superior cause trouble but steps are now </seg>
            <seg id="p121">DEPARTMENT OP PUBLIC WORKS 119 being taken to remedy this. One-man graders are used for main - tenance. Sherman County Of great benefit to this county is the construction of Project 292-A, now being built from Loup City to Ashton. The road crosses the roughest part of the county and is their only outlet to the east. The supervisors have contracted the grading and have a well organized force. When 18 miles of gravel on the Potash is completed there will be a continuous stretch of gravel from Broken Bow to Lincoln and Omaha, a distance of about 260 miles. Almost Down to Grade on State-Federal Aid Project No. 292-A Valley County A very fine gravel road has been built from North Loup to Ord. Drainage has always been a big problem on this stretch, which neces - sitated extensive drainage surveys to correct. From Ord to Arcadia the heaviest construction has been accomplished. This is practically the only outlet for the southwest part of the county to the county seat. Valley County Supervisors were the grading contractors on this work. The soil washes easily but otherwise the roads are easily main- tained. </seg>
            <seg id="p122">120 REPORT OF SECRETARY Webster County Ten miles of heavy construction has been completed from Red Cloud to Guide Rock. In addition to this, 18 miles of gravel has been placed on the Red Cloud-Hastings road. The poor alignment through Cowles has been improved and distance shortened. Red Cloud is now connected with a well graveled road with the D. L. D. and Lincoln Highway. REPORT OF DISTRICT FIVE MILEAGE OF STATE AND FEDERAL AID ROADS WITH CLASSIFICATION OF IMPROVEMENTS. Figures include all work under contract. Banner County Grading and graveling from the Scottsbluff-Banner County line south has been completed during the biennium, leaving approximately seven miles of unimproved highway to connect with the improved road in the south end of the County. Twenty miles remain to be graveled to complete the surfacing across the County. Since there is no railroad in Banner County it is of utmost importance to carry the construction work to completion to provide a year around outlet to the people of the county. Maintenance on the whole has been good. Considerable money was spent during the winter of 1925 and 1926 on account of snow, in an effort to maintain continuous traffic. Efforts were reasonably suc - cessful, dependent on conditions which prevailed during the winter. A. M. Gaddis, District Engineer </seg>
            <seg id="p123">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 121 \ The Unimproved State Highway Appears Lost Among the Canyons And Pines In Banner County Box Bntte County The most important achievement during the biennium was the com - pletion of the road south from Alliance tapping the North Platte Valley highway seven miles northwest of Bridgeport. Approximately eight miles of this highway lies in Box Butte County, all of which was graded In 1925 and graveled early in 1926. The completion of this highway serves to connect northwest Nebraska with the rest of the State and is greatly appreciated. All projects which have been built with Federal Aid have been gravel surfaced except between Berea and Hemingford, a distance of about eight miles, which should be completed soon. Total mileage of gravel roads in the County is thirty-two out of a total of eighty-three miles of State Highway in the County. In 1926, approximately twenty miles of the highway system were graded with an elevating grader, supplemented with team work, and ten miles were bladed to State Standard. With a little more grading the twenty miles will be ready for gravel which should be undertaken as soon as possible. Maintenance has at all times been good. Snow conditions during the winter of 1925 and 1926 were especially bad, which left the roads in very bad shape in the early spring of 1926. </seg>
            <seg id="p124">122 REPORT OF SECRETARY Cheyenne County In addition to completing gravel which was nnder construction at the beginning of the biennium, approximately 26 miles of gravel have been placed under contract, ten of which have been completed. About 15 miles of grading and two bridges also have been completed, during the biennium, making a total of graded road completed forty-nine miles and thirty-nine miles of gravel out of a total of seventy-nine miles, the total highway system of the county. Improvements which should be taken up soon are the completion of the north and south highway from Gurley through Dalton to the north County line; from a point ten miles west of Sidney to the West County line and a connection of approximately seven miles between Sidney and Lodgepole, all of which should be accomplished during the coming biennium. Dawes County Aside from one Federal and State project in the south end of Dawes County, construction work has been confined to the Blue Pole High - way IT. S. No. 20. Grading and structures have been completed on six miles west of Chadron and approximately twelve miles between Chad - ron and the East County line. Ten large bridges and one subway under the C. &amp; N. W. Railroad tracks were included in this work. The pro - ject near the South County line was approximately two miles in length. The road from Chadron north and Crawford south were both put under State maintenance at the beginning of 1926 and considerable heavy work was done south of Crawford, making considerable im - provement in the condition of this road. The highways in this county are unusually expensive to biuld, and only a small part of the total mile - age of the county has been completed. No graveling has been done and gravel is needed unusually bad on a large percent of the mileage. The county allotment will not be adequate to complete the system for considerable time unless other funds are made available for this work. The next construction to be taken up is the completion of the high - way between Chadron and Crawford, the route of which will be changed to the south side of the Railroad track the entire distance. Good results have been obtained by the maintenance forces in the county. </seg>

This practically com - pletes gravel surfacing from a point six miles east of Big Springs to ten miles west of Sidney, a distance of about seventy miles. This has not all been built to Federal and State standard but a large part of it contains natural gravel sufficient to be called gravel surfaced. The grading and graveling of a five mile connection between Big Springs and Julesburg is under way and should be completed early in 1927. Approximately fifteen miles of State Highway in this county remain to be built to Federal Standard, the portion from Chappell to the west county line and that from Big Springs west 5 miles on the Denver branch of the Lincoln Highway. Garden County Very gratifying results have been obtained in this county during the biennium. In addition to about seven miles of gravel which was placed previously, about twenty miles have been added, and about fifteen miles have been graded. Two Platte river bridges have also been completed. The entire highway system but about nine miles has been improved with Federal aid, and one more year should see the completion of the entire system in the county. By relocations which were undertaken several bad turns and railroad crossings have been </seg>
            <seg id="p126">124 REPORT OF SECRETARY eliminated. Fine cooperation has been received from the county Com - missioners. Maintenance in the county has been very good. Kimball County At the close of 1926 the Lincoln Highway through Kimball County, between Dix and Bushnell was put to standard grade and graveled. The Klmball-Scottsbluff highway leading north from Kimball contains sufficient gravel in most places to justify the postponement of surfac - ing on the road until the more traveled Lincoln Highway is taken care of. In addition to the completion of the gravel east and west, tbe highway from Bushnell to the State line was regraded with State forces and is in good condition. A new bridge is also contracted north of Kimball over Lodgepole Creek, an improvement much desired by the residents of Kimball and the north table of Kimball and Banner Counties. A total of about sixteen miles remains to be put to permanent grade and about twenty-nine miles are yet to be graveled to complete the present highway system. The highway from Dix to the East County line is probably the most needed improvement. Morrill County The most outstanding and important improvement during the biennium was the completion of the portion of the Bridgeport-Alliance road from Angora to Alliance. This job went forward with remark - able speed, now being completely graveled, and serves to connect Northwest Nebraska, South Dakota and the Black Hills, with Southern and Eastern Nebraska and Colorado. It is considered by people of western Nebraska generally to be the most important piece of road work yet completed in this section. In addition to this the Broadwater bridge was completed and considerable grading work was done east and west of Bayard. Some improvements also were made on the Bridgeport-Sidney highway north of Dalton. Considerable improve - ments are yet necessary to complete the highway system in this County. Bayard east and west should be graveled, Broadwater east and west should be built and a project should be placed north of Dalton. Scottsbluff County The most outstanding accomplishment in this county in the past two years is the awarding of contract on paving between Scottsbluff and Gering connecting paving in Scottsbluff with pavement in Gering. This was made possible by the participation of the Federal Bureau, the State, the County, the two municipalities and the property owners along the improvement. This work will be completed early in 1927. </seg>
            <seg id="p127">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 125 In addition to this, four miles of graveling was completed east of Minatare and five miles of grading and gravel south of Gering, on which three new bridges were built. Sections of the highway which should come up for early attention are as follows: From Morrill to Henry, where it is planned to parallel the railroad track; both directions from Minatare, a total distance of about five miles, gap of about four miles between Gering and Stage Hill at the South County line. Additional improvement also will be needed between Mitchell and Scottsbluff. Additional gravel is being placed on the Scottsbluff east road to take care of the exceptionally heavy traffic it receives. Sheridan County During the biennium the grading of Highway U. S. No. 20 was completed across the county with the completion of the work from Gordon to the Cherry County line, a distance of six miles. This high - way has been graveled from Gordon to Hay Springs and is an ex - cellent piece of road. The Potash Highway, State No. 2, was graded and graveled from Antioch to Lakeside and graveled from Antioch west to the county line. All of the mileage in this county has been graded with the exception of a portion of the Potash Highway from Lakeside east to the County line, approximately twenty-four miles, a project which will be very expensive to build. This work should be carried to completion as rapidly as possible, as should the completion of the gravel on U. S. No. 20 and State No, 62 from Gordon north. The County officials of this county have been very enthusiastic over the work on their highways and have lent every help possible to make it a success. Maintenance has been excellent. Sioux County The highway in Sioux County from Harrison east to the west limits of Fort Robinson has all been graded to State and Federal Standard, three miles of which have been graveled. Gravel contract has been awarded on additional six miles, but was not placed on ac - count of the grading not being completed in time to allow it. In 1926 the highways from Harrison west to the State line and from Harrison south about ten miles were graded with a heavy outfit, a total of about 197 miles. The next work to be taken up in Sioux County is the com - pletion of the graveling east of Harrison and the grading and gravel - ing from Harrison west. The completion of the road south should follow in proper order. </seg>
            <seg id="p128">126 REPORT OF SECRETARY REPORT OF DISTRICT SIX A. T. Lobdell, District Engineer (Taken from History and Stories of Nebraska by Addison E. Sheldon) On the 17th of September, 1869, was fought the hardest battle be - tween the white men and the plains Indians in the annals of the West. It was fought on the Arickaree fork of the Republican River, a few miles from the southwest corner of Nebraska and not far from the present town of Wray, Colorado, on the Denver line of the Burlington road. Fifty one scouts and Frontiersmen under the command of Lieut. Geo. A. Foroyth stood off, on a little sandbar in the river, the combined forces of the Northern Cheyennes Arapahoes and Ogalalla Sioux for nine days. They lost more than one third of their own number in killed and wounded while the Indian loss was many times as great. For months these Indians had been murdering the settlers and travelers in western Nebraska and Kansas. Soldiers were sent to pursue them but always arrived on the scene of their action after the Indians were gone, finding nothing but the melancholy duty of bury - ing the murdered citizens.

            <seg id="p129">DEPARTMENT OP PUBLIC WORKS 127 tives by the Indians. Some of them were noted scouts. All of them enlisted to fight. Early in September this little command started from the place of the latest Indian murder near Fort Wallace, Kansas. They struck a trail leading to the Republican River. Following the trail up the Republican River in Nebraska it was joined by other trails and still others until the little party of fifty men was traveling a great beaten road, as wide as the Oregon Trail, made by thousands of Indians and ponies, and with hundreds of camp fires where they stopped at night. It seemed a crazy act to follow so great a trail with so small a party, but the little band had started out to find and fight Indians and kept on. On the afternoon of September 16th, the Indians signs were very fresh and Lieutenant Forsyth resolved to go into camp early, rest his men and be ready to strike the Indians the next day. An extra number of men were posted on picket duty to prevent surprise. In the earliest gray of the next morning, the men were up and saddling their horses when there came a volley of shots from the pickets followed by the yell and rush of Indians. The savages had expected to find the soldiers asleep and their horses out feeding. Their plan was to stampede the horses and leave the soldiers on foot in the open prairie where they could easily surround them and cut them off. They found their horses saddled, every scout ready with his rifle, and soon retreated out of reach of the white men's bullets. As daylight broke, Grover, the head scout, exclaimed, "Look at the Indians!" The hills on both sides of the little valley swarmed with them. None of the scouts had ever be - fore seen so many hostile Indians in one body. Lieutenant Forsyth saw the situation at a glance. A few hundred yards away in the middle of the river was a sandbar island having one cottonwood tree and a growth of willows. It was the only cover in the valley. At the word of command the scouts dashed forward through the water to the island. Every han tied his horse strongly to a willow bush and dropping on his knee held his rifle in one hand and dug a hole in the sand with the other. This move was a complete sur - prise to the Indians. They had expected to eat up the little band at one mouthful. They now saw them making a fort out of the little island. The Indians crowded up to the bank on both sides of the river and filled the air with a storm of bullets and arrows. A number of scouts were killed and wounded, while the poor horses plunged and struggled in misery until they fell in death. The fire of the Indians was very hot and accurate. Lieutenant Forsyth had his leg broken by a bullet and his second in command. Lieutenant Frederick H. Beecher, a nephew of Henry Ward Beecher, </seg>
            <seg id="p130">128 REPORT OF SECRETARY was killed. Forsyth cut the bullet from his leg, which he bandaged with his own hands, telling his men to be steady, to help each other and to make every shot count. In the course of an hour the men be - came calmer. They were getting a good cover with sand and dead horses. Every time an Indian showed himself within range a bullet went after him. This discouraged the Indians so much that they drew back, while the scouts took time to care for the wounded and to throw up more sand. About noon there was a great gathering of Indians on the hill in sight of the scouts. Warriors came riding in from all parts of the field. Among them was one whom every scout knew at long distance. He was Roman Nose, over six feet tall, the tallest Indian on the plains, and one of their greatest chiefs. It was evident a big plan was under way. The council broke up and the plan appeared. Roman Nose led a body of mounted young men out into the valley. Others joined them. They drew together in a line facing the island with Roman Nose at the head. The plan was now clear. This chosen body of two or three hundred was to charge straight on the island while the rest of the Indians crept up through the grass and fired as fast as they could at the scouts in their sand pits to distract their attention. Roman Nose gave the signal and his horsemen started for the island. Lieutenant Forsyth had ordered his men not to fire until the first pony reached the river's edge. The scouts were armed with a new gun, the Spencer Seven-shooter Carbine. The Indians knew what a one-shot riflle was, but had never seen one that shot seven times without loading. On came the line of Indians, yelling and whipping their horses. Just at the river's bank the rifles of the scouts flashed from the sand pits and groups of riders fell from their ponies. On they came. Another volley and more Indians fell. Another, and an - other and another and another, with a steady aim and terrible effect. Roman Nose himself fell dead from his horse and the Indian line broke and scattered. Lieutenant Forsyth turned anxiously to his scout Grover. "Can they do any better than that?" he asked. "I have been on these plains, boy and man, for twenty years and I never saw any - thing like it," answered the scout. "Then we have got them," re - plied Forsyth. The battle now changed to a siege, while from the hills arose that most harrowing of all sorrowful cries, the wail of the Indian women for their dead. Through many hours this haunted the ears of the men on the island. There were no more attempts to take the island by storm. Starvation was the Indian plan. At the first of the fight the scouts had lost their pack mules with all their provisions. They had nothing but river water and dead horse. Attempts were made after dark to creep through the Indian lines and carry word to the railroad </seg>

Another attempt was made, two scouts crept out in the darkness and did not return. Those left on the island could not know whether their messengers were dead or not. They could only hope and watch the line where the sky and prairie met. For a whole week they lay in their sand pits, drank river water and ate horse meat. The hot sun glared from the sky, the smell of the dead filled the air, the flies buzzed and the Indians glided steathily about the hills. A little charge would have captured the island now, but the Indians had suffered too much to try again. They preferred to starve the scouts. It was in the forenoon of September 25th, when a dark moving patch appeared far off on the prairie. It grew larger until the watchers saw that it was an ambulance and a column of cavalry. They knew then that the battle and the siege of Beecher Island were over. The Indians fled as the soldiers came near and soon the starving and wounded were' being cared for. General Custer said that the Arickaree fight was the greatest battle on the plains. At Wounded Knee, South Dakota, lives a tall wise Sioux named Fire Lightning. He was in the Arickaree fight and told me this story one summer afternoon sitting in the shadow of his log house and looking out upon his garden. He said the Indians lost nearly a hundred men in the fight and showed by gestures with his hands how fast the white men fired from their sand pits and how Roman Nose fell from his horse. </seg>
            <seg id="p132">130 REPORT OF SECRETARY The Splendid Highway, Project Xo. 68-A Traverses Massacre Canyon, the Sioux-Pawnee battlefield of half a century ago. Another outstanding place of historical interest is Massacre Canyon on Project 68-A about two and one-half miles east of Trenton, Hitch - cock County. The State Highway crosses this Canyon very close to where the massacre of the Pawnees by the Sioux took place August 5, 1873. The following brief description is from an account of J. W. William - son, a white man who accompanied the Pawnee Indians representing the Government. "On August 4th the Pawnees made camp on the north bank of the Republican River. About nine o'clock that night three white men came into camp and reported that the Sioux warriors were camped about twenty miles northwest awaiting an opportunity to attack the Pawnees. Sky Chief who was the Chieftain of the Pawnees did not take the report seriously. On the following morning, August 5th, the Pawnees broke camp and started north up the divide between the Republican and French - man Rivers. In a few minutes a buffalo scout informed them that buffalo had been sighted in the distance and Sky Chief and most of the Indians went after the buffalo. These Indians who went after the buffalo got too far away to return for the fight when the Sioux ap - peared during the forenoon. After the main body of the Pawnees had traveled about a mile the head of the procession stopped as they had </seg>
            <seg id="p133">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 131 received word from a scout that the Sioux were coining to attack them. At that time they were about a hundred yards from the head of the Canyon. Orders were shouted down the line for the squaws and their children together with the pack ponies to take refuge in the canyon. The warriors prepared to ride forth to meet the Sioux. After a short consultation between Chief Terra Recekons and Fighting Bear they decided that having fought the Sioux before In the open they could do so again and accordingly made ready where they were. After a short time the squaws got themselves ready and the chant or War Song of the Pawnees was heard from the Canyon. At this time the Sioux came over the hill and it was soon apparent that they outnumbered the fighting men of the Pawnees four to one. It was readily found that this was true as there were about fifteen hundred in the band under the command of Chief Snow Flake of Brule Sioux. Suddenly the war whoop of the Sioux sounded and the battle was on. The Pawnee warriors answered the battle cry of the Sioux and about three hundred and fifty Pawnees rode out to meet the Sioux. The Pawnees put up a splendid fight but the odds were against them. Soon the Pawnee Chief noted that the Sioux had surrounded the head of the Canyon and orders were given to retreat. The squaws cut the thongs that bound the packs of meat on the ponies and they mounted the ponies with the children and retreated down the Canyon. Just imagine about 700 Indians and children and as many ponies huddled together and running for dear life down the Canyon with over twelve hundred blood thirsty savages coming down on them. In some places the Canyon was quite narrow and this delayed the retreat. It was due to this fact that so many lives were lost as the Sioux rode on the high ground and fired down into the helpless Pawnees in the bottom of the Canyon. As the Pawnees reached the Republican River and were crossing to the opposite bank the Sioux cut down a good many more Pawnees and succeeded in cuttting off seven hundred ponies. The Sioux then started to cross the river at another point to pursue the Pawnees when they suddenly stopped. There appeared a flag patrol and a troop of U. S. Cavalry. When the Sioux saw the soldiers they hastily After the Sioux left, endeavors were made to have the Pawnees return and bury their dead and care for their wounded but the Pawnees said that the wounded had been killed and they did not return. Camp was made that night on the banks of Red Willow Creek. All of their supplies had been left on the battlefield and they had a miser - able night. The warriors who had fought most valiantly a few hours before pulled hairs from their head and joined in the demonstrations </seg>
            <seg id="p134">132 REPORT OF SECRETARY of grief. The squaws and children were nearly frantic with grief and 'kept up an incessant wail all night. The next day the Pawnees started east and obtained food at a -settlement. During the day the Pawnees killed a herd of twelve -buffaloes which gave them sufficient food. After that the Pawnees walked back through Arapahoe north to Plum Creek and then to Genoa, making a sorrowful return from the last buffalo hunt in a country that had been their home for many years. The Sioux lost fifty warriors on the battlefield, while the Pawnees ■ lost several times that number of men, women and children. The government penalized the Sioux $10,000 in cash which was given to ■the Pawnees to reimburse them for the Pawnees killed, the supplies •and meat lost, and the ponies captured. • Texas Cattle Trail About 1870 to 1879 during the Railroad construction in the Platte Valley there developed a need for food in the new towns developed 'along the Railroad. To supply this they began driving Texas steers north across Oklahoma, Kansas and Nebraska. The common point of crossing was about the west edge of Dundy and Chase Counties near where Haigler, Lamar, and Venango have been built up. This old Texas trail shows tracks sometimes two hundred or three hundred feet wide and follows from water hole to water hole. As railroad construction continued farther west the Texas Trail ■was opened up from Texas to Montana and was used until about 1883. It followed in general the same lines as when it first went to Ogalalla. </seg>
            <seg id="p135">DEPARTMENT OP PUBLIC WORKS 133 Wanneta Falls, just off the State Highway Through Wanneta First Settlement In Chase County The first permanent settlement in Chase County was at Wauneta Falls, Chase County, in 1876. It was at this point that the first flour mill in southwest Nebraska was built and this was an important center and trading point in the early days. Cheyenne Indians In The West In 1878 the Cheyenne Indians stampeded from their reservation In Oklahoma and were finally rounded up by the U. S. Cavalry on the high land northwest of Wauneta which the State Highway now crosses from Wauneta to Imperial. Chase County Up to 1925 tourists on the D. L. D. in the first ten miles southeast of Imperial often wondered when they hit the long sand stretches whether they were on the right road. This condition was remedied and an excellent piece of road graded, clay surfaced, and gravel sur - faced on Project 95-B from Imperial southeast for 8.2 miles in 1926. In 1926 Project 272-B from the Colorado state line east through Lamar was graded with State Funds only, for a distance of eighteen miles. The west eight miles of this Project was gravel surfaced and It is the general opinion that on the completion of this Project the roads </seg>
            <seg id="p136">REPORT OF SECRETARY 134 in Chase County became superior to those in Colorado due to more frequent maintenance and elimination of corrugated surfaces. Project 272 was relocated so as to lie on the divide between the Stinking Water and Frenchman Creeks. For its entire length no bridges and only one small pipe was used. During the construction of Project 272-A a good detour was graded, marked, and maintained. Maintenance during 1925 was generally good due to average rain fall and good work by the patrolmen. During 1926 due to dry weather it was more difficult to maintain the surfaces, however, by placing a Wehr one-man machine at Lamar and a similar machine at Wauneta together with an Avery Road Raiser and a truck at Imperial good re - sults were obtained. During 1926 a small patrol shed was erected at Imperial. Dandy County Dundy County with Colorado as its west boundry and with Kansas as its south boundary felt that their roads should be put up in con - dition better than the adjoining states. In 1925 in order to obtain this result from Haigler west to meet Colorado, Project 191 was re - opened to raise the grade about 2 feet above the swamp and to gravel the project. The completion of this project in the fall of 1925 produced a road which has been spoken of as one of the best roads in Southwest Nebraska and generally superior to Colorado gravel roads. Following the placing of gravel from Haigler west, gravel surfacing was placed on seven miles of Project 71 from the Railroad crossing east of Benkelman to the west end of Project 41 at Doane except through Benkelman which was not on the Project. During 1926 as a result of successful gravel placed in 1925, Pro - ject 41-B, 1.5 miles long, covering the elimination of two railroad crossings and a new grade and gravel through Blue Point Hill was completed. The grading required 34000 cu. yds. earth excavation and 8000 cu. yds. loose rock excavation on 41-B. Project 7 4- A including 8.5 miles of grading, gravel surfacing, and a 45 foot creosoted timber trestle bridge across Rock Creek i nParks and a 204 foot creosoted timber trestle across the Republican River west of Parks was com - pleted in 1926. .During 1925 due to lack of funds and lack of equipment, the main - tenance was only fair on the State Highways. During 1926 by placing a one man Gallon machine at Benkelman, another similar machine at Haigler and covering the State Highway from Max east with a machine working out of Stratton very decided improved maintenance resulted. The surface has been generally good during 1926 for the first time since the establishment of the State Highway system. The </seg>

During the construction of the projects, detours were built, marked, and maintained for the first time in this County. Franklin County Early in 1925 Project 205-B from Franklin east to Riverton was put under contract. The location of this Project was determined after a careful study and an estimate made of two other possible locations. One possibility was to go from Franklin south across the river and thence east on the south side of the river recrossing the Republican River at Riverton. This route was rejected on account of adding two railroad grade crossings, three ane one-half miles of extra length, and introducing two Republican River bridges as well as flood conditions on the south side of the river. Another route investigated was on the north side of the C. B. &amp; Q. right-of-way. This was rejected on ac - count of necessity of buying an entirely new R. O. W. and the fact that the cost of construction would be practically the same as com - pleting the highway on the tangent on which it was built. The con - struction of this highway involved 170,000 cu. yds. of earth excavation. The grading contractor built this road from August to November, 1925 and averaged over 45,000 yds. of earth excavation per month. A Wonderful Improvement. State-Federal Aid Project 2O5-B </seg>
            <seg id="p138">136 REPORT OF SECRETARY Six steel concrete bridges and twelve large box culverts were built. This was one of the heaviest jobs of construction in the state during 1925. On account of the fact that there was less than an Inch of rainfall while this Project was being built and as many of the fills averaged 30 feet in height the settlement of the dirt during 1926 made maintenance a difficult matter. The placing of guard rail was held off until the fall of 1926 to permit as much settlement as possible. During 1925 a box culvert was built on Project 71 east of Franklin to replace a concrete arch which had been used in place and which collapsed in 1925. Maintenance during 1925 was satisfactory on the State system. During 1926 a Wehr one-man machine was placed at Riverton and a similar machine was placed at Upland. Trucks were used at Naponee and Franklin. This equipment together with a ten ton Monarch tractor and big blade at Franklin gave improved maintenance condi - tions in 1926. Following many conferences and after Franklin citizens had ex - hibited great interest in placing the road from Franklin south on the State system an agreement was reached in the fall of 1926 placing this road under State Maintenance and getting it ready for State con - struction. A survey was taken on the Franklin-Minden road to elimi - nate four miles of distance between these two county seats which will Involve about four miles of clay and gravel surfacing in the north part of Franklin County. Frontier County During 1925 Project 244 from Stock ville east twenty-three miles was graded. The details of this construction are very interesting due to the economical plans and methods involved, results obtained and also the uncovering of an ancient Indian village in one of the cuts on a relocation. Eleven Indian bodies were found together with sufficient relics to prove that the village did not belong to the recent Indian races but was many hundreds of years old. During 1926 a contract was let for the six miles from Quick south to Red Willow County on the McCook-Maywood route. Following the completion of the Stockville-Elwood road the County Board passed a resolution asking for construction on the Curtis-Morefield-Eustis road to be located near the railroad on the High Line Highway. This route is being investigated preparatory to construction after the balance of the McCook-Maywood road shall have been completed across Frontier County. \ </seg>

The above construction was contracted and completed at $3.50 per 100 feet or about $185.00 per mile or 5c per cu. yd The Maywood-Curtis-Stockville road was satisfactory main - tained in 1925 but very little was done from May wood south or from Stockville east in 1925. In 1926 with the placing of a Wehr one man machine at Curtis together with a five ton Holt tractor at Curtis, and the placing of a Hadfield-Pennfield one man machine at Oraflno uniformly satisfactory maintenance has resulted. Furnas County Project 30-C consisting of a channel change with a 64 ft. creosoted timber trestle east of Beaver City in order to relieve flood conditions on Beaver Creek was completed in 1925. During 1926 Projects 2 54-A and B were completed from Arapahoe through Holbrook to meet Project 67-A four and one-half miles east of Cambridge. This project of .ten miles required 130,000 cu. yds. During the construction of this project one of the heaviest floods in the county washed out considerable earth excavation which had to be replaced by the con - tractor and delayed the grading for several weeks. On this project there were built the following bridges: 21 ft. creosoted wood bridge for flood relief from Deer Creek between Arapahoe and Holbrook; 220 ft. steel wood bridge at Holbrook over Deer Creek together with the channel change is figured to eliminate flood conditions in Hol - brook; 42 ft. cresosoted wood bridge over Kapin Canyon west of </seg>

This project will aid materially in getting through traffic across Furnas County in flood times which has been difficult on account of the heavy discharge of waters directly at the foot of the hills on to the State Highway. In order to improve a dangerous railroad grade crossing about eight miles East of Beaver City on Orleans-Beaver City State High - way Project 194-B was built and paid for equally by C. B. &amp; Q. Rail - road and State funds. Maintenance during 1925 was fairly good. During 1926 main - tenance conditions were decidedly improved by the use of a Galion one man machine at Oxford; a similar machine at Beaver City, a Wehr one man machine at Cambridge and trucks at Arapahoe. A Holt ten ton tractor and 12 ft. grader were used almost steadily on the State System during 1924 cleaning ditches and rebuilding grades. North of Arapahoe blade grading was done to complete the road into Gosper County. A patrol shed was built at Arapahoe providing a work shop, storage room, and office space for field parties. During the construction of 254-A and B detours were graded, marked, and maintained. State-Federal Aid Project Xo. 252-B Provides a sure way for the farmers to reach market with a heavy load. </seg>

Gosper County During 1925 no construction was done but preparations were made for a big year in 1926. During 1926 Project 11 was recon - structed and four major re-locations made from State Funds and then gravel surfaced. Project 252-B from Elwood north to the County line toward Lexington was graded, numerous small structures placed, and a 92 ft. steel concrete bridge built across Plum Creek. By the use of State Funds only the State Highway was graded from a point five miles south of Elwood to Arapahoe and a grade satis - factory to the general public was completed here. The Bertrand- Smithfteld road was regraded from State Funds and thus all of the State Highway in Gosper County has been graded. A total of sixteen major re-locations each over 400 ft. in length were accomplished during 1926. The County Board furnished nec - essary R. O. W. costing approximately $7,000.00, and co-operated in the most satisfactory manner possible. In general these re-locations were made to avoid grades, shorten distances, and put in from 350 ft. to 1000 ft. radius curves in place of short curves previously used. </seg>
            <seg id="p142">140 REPORT OF SECRETARY Maintenance during 1925 was fair. Surfaces were cared for but very little work was done outside of surface work. During 1926 under a very efficient Chief Patrolman maintenance was very much improved. A heavy grading crew was kept at work for the entire year, cleaning ditches and regrading State Highways. A Wehr one man machine has been used at Elwood together with a truck and a heavy grading outfit also working out of Elwood. The Smithfleld- Bertrand road was maintained by a one man machine which worked from Smithfield to Loomis. Harlan County During 1925 Project 2 40- A was graded, three concrete steel bridges and a large number of box culverts and pipes were com - pleted between Orleans and Oxford. This required two re-locations of about one-half mile each to eliminate turns and shorten dis - tances for which R. O. W. was furnished by the County Board. Dur - ing 1926 the Oxford-Mascot-Atlanta re-location was graded with State Funds only and traffic turned over this road during September 1926.

Maintenance on State roads in Harlan County has been uniformly - satisfactory due to an experienced patrol crew and a very capable Chief Patrolman. A Gilbert one man machine was used at Alma, m Wehr one man machine at Ragan, and also at Stamford, and trucks were used out of Alma together with a Best 60 and a big blade grader. During 1926 the entire State Highway had ditches cleaned and surfaces refreshed with new dirt.

In addition to this grading, gravel surfacing on five miles of Project 126-A and three miles on 63-A were completed. It required three lettings to obtain satisfactory arrangements for gravel surfacing. Contractors were loath to bid because no gravel surfacing had been done in the county and because of their in - experience in handling local (magnesia) gravel. The surveys be - tween Palisade and Hamlet have been completed and plans have been prepared for a 1927 letting. During 1926 great improvements were made on maintenance in Hayes County under a capable Chief Patrolman. A Wehr one man machine was located at Hayes Center and team dragging by farmers was eliminated. A similar machine was also placed at Palisade. During the construction of two Projects in Hayes County detours were graded, marked, and maintained. Hitchcock County During 1925 gravel surfacing was placed on Project 68-C from Culbertson east to the county line. During 1926 gravel was placed on 243-A and 68-D west of Culbertson. An agreement was reached through the City of Culbertson and Project 68-E was completed with large radius curves and improved grade, curb and gutter, and gravel surfacing in 1926. A further Project 243-A was built in the summer of 1926 from Palisade to Beverly to eliminate two large French - man River bridges, four irrigation bridges, two miles in distance, and eight sharp turns. Due to lack of funds in 1925 there was no improvement of previous years in Hitchcock county maintenance. In 1926 main - tenance was improved on State Highways in Hitchcock County by using Wehr one man machines at Trenton, Stratton, Culbertson, and Palisade. In addition a John Deere machine was used out of Cul - bertson. A re-location on the Federal route from Culbertson north in Hayes County was completed early in 1926. Kearney County During 1925 Project 248 from Axtell to the Platte Valley road south of Kearney was built. This project was an experiment through the sand hills. No drainage structures were used in the sand hills and instead of building high fills, rolling grades were used to utilize previously placed clay surfacing and to avoid cutting the sand hills. An eight inch ditch was used in place of the usual eighteen inch ditch. Wherever the sand hills had to be cut to obtain standard grades straw was placed in the ditches and on the back slopes to </seg>

During 1925, 2.2 miles on the D. L. D. were graded and graveled from Axtell west. During 1926 gravel surfacing was completed from Minden to Newark on Project 196. The Kearney-Axtell road was completed by Project 283 in the Platte Valley. The last connect - ing link on the D. L. D. from Atlanta to Omaha was completed when Project 253 from Minden west on the north side of the C. B. &amp; Q. track to Axtell was done. The use of Wehr one man machines at Minden, Heartwell and Axtell together with Rumley Engines south of Kearney and at Axtell and the truck at Minden has produced uniformly satisfactory main - tenance. During the construction of the Projects detours were graded, marked, and maintained. State Engineering aid was furnished the County toward starting the first grading and gravel Project on county roads from Minden to Norman in 1926. Perkins County During 1925 gravel surfacing was completed from Grant to Elsie making a continuous gravel surface on this so-called "Boulevard of the Sand Hills." During 1926 Project 264-A was completed to in - clude grading, one creosoted timber trestle, clay surfacing and gravel surfacing from Grant west to Brandon, a distance of eleven miles. This Project is on the south side of the C. B. &amp; Q. tracks in ac - cordance with the new route of Highway No. 17 which will cross Perkins County on the south side of the C. B. &amp; Q. Railroad for the entire width of the county and thus eliminate four railroad crossings and be free from snow troubles as the Burlington grade protects the Highway from snow. During this biennium the maintenance has been uniformly good. During 1926 the road from Elsie to Grainton and south to Hayes County line was regraded on the south side of the track and well maintained. The road from Brandon to Vanango was graded using a maintenance outfit and has been well maintained. During the con - struction of the Grant-Brandon Project, a detour was graded on the north side of the C. B. &amp; Q. tracks requiring the use of an elevating grader for two months and heavy blade work for three weeks before this detour was used. In this way a well maintained and well marked highway has been in use clear across Perkins county while the con - struction was being done on the Projects. This county has the only team patrol outfit in this District. The results on the light soil of Perkins County have been satisfactory although the machine units can cover their sections quicker and better than the team patrol. </seg>

Rod Willow County Following the discovery of gravel in the Republican Valley in 1924 and its successful use on the D. L. D., an additional gravel project was built in 1925 from McCook east to Red Willow which was preceeded by the reconstruction of this old Project and the widening of the fills by State Funds. In 1926 still more Republican Valley gravel was placed from Red Willow east to near Indlanola on old Project 46 together with a new 120 ft. steel bridge across Red Willow Creek to replace a 40 ft. bridge which was not sufficient for flood stages.

            <seg id="p149">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 147 The Highway from Arthur to Keystone has approximately seven miles graded with a permanent grade and surfaced with the best local material available. The Arthur-Martin Highway was just re - cently added to the system and rapid progress has been made in getting construction started, for which funds are available to com - plete it to the south County line. The contract has been awarded for grading and eight inch clay surfacing and work has just started. One patrolman with four horses, a hayrack, wagon and light blade comprise the maintenance force caring for the fifteen miles from Arthur to Keystone. Buffalo County The entire State Highway system in Buffalo County has been graded and graveled with the exception of 3.5 miles located on High - way No. 10, north of Pleasant on, for which contract has been let and work started. The availability of local gravel from the Platte River has aided materially in the rapid progress of gravel surfaced roads. Three important Highways traverse this County. The Lincoln Highway or U. S. No. 30, which for the most part parallels the Union Pacific Railroad has a very heavy traffic both local and tourist. The soil varies from a sandy loam to a heavy clay which causes the condition of the roads to vary in different sec - tions across the county. Considerable difficulty was had the past year in keeping the surface of Project 227 smooth, due to extremely dry weather and an excess of gravel in the windrow. The project, twenty miles in length, originally received four inches of gravel and it became necessary to scarify it in order to hasten compaction and reduce the excess gravel on the surface and in the windrow. The results were very satisfactory and at present the surface is in good condition. Highway No. 10 from Kearney north to the County line passes through yellow clay hills which makes an excellent binder for gravel. Gravel surfacing was completed about a year ago and since that time the road has been in excellent condition. The Potash Highway or Highway No. 2 traverses the northeast part of the County. This section, Project 276-B, fourteen miles in length has recently been graded and graveled. Eight one-man maintainer type patrols take care of the regular maintenance, with the occasional assistance of a heavy tractor and blade outfit. A machine shop has been maintained in conjunction with the County which has been very satisfactory. Soil and other conditions are favorable to good maintenance in this County. </seg>
            <seg id="p150">148 REPORT OF SECRETARY The Platte River which skirts the southern boundary of the County necessitates the construction and upkeep of several large bridges. This year the County availed themselves of the State Aid Bridge Fund and there is now under construction a $90,000.00 bridge and approach fills located south of Gibbon. Coster County Custer County has the largest mileage of State Highways of any Eunty in the State. With the exception of nineteen miles of sand e soil is a good road material, being a light yellow clay. With the oper amount of moisture conditions are favorable for good roads. The Custer County Board has been very aggressive in their ideas of road construction and have been successful bidders on the grading Projects 96-C, 188-C, 22-B, C, D, and E, all of which were contracted for in the spring of 1926 and completed in the fall of the same year. Prior to this biennium no gravel surfacing was undertaken, this County being handicapped as to the availability of local gravel and all gravel for road purposes is shipped in. This biennium has seen the completion of approximately fifty miles of gravel surfaced roads, as follows; Broken Bow east to the County line, thirty-five miles, Sargent north, eight miles and Sargent south, seven miles. An improvement of considerable merit was made from Broken Bow east on Highway No. 2, where in a distance of thirty-five miles, there were nine railroad crossings which were eliminated with the exception of three by the completion of Projects 22-B, C, D and E. Also in connection with this improvement construction for grading and gravel was carried through three towns on the Highway east of Broken Bow. All the above improvements being made on Fed - eral Aid Project 22 which was completed in 1922. With the completion of Projects 96-C and 188-C a ten mile gap' was closed on Highway No. 27 from Broken Bow to Arnold. Pre - viously this had been a bad stretch of road, being improperly located through a canyon country and with very little grading, each rain of any size would make it almost Impassable. Twelve regular patrols care for the maintenance of one hundred and sixty-eight miles of improved roads in this County. With the exception of three one-man maintainer type patrols, all maintenance 8 done with trucks, more frequently referred to as "old Army trucks" and wood drags. On all except graveled roads V-ditchers were used n order to bring fresh dirt on the surface and keep the weeds down. Considerable maintenance work was accomplished with two heavy </seg>
            <seg id="p151">DEPARTMENT OP PUBLIC WORKS 149 tractors and blade outfits which were operating eight months of a year reshaping and preparing projects for gravel. A first-class ma - chine shop and equipment yard is maintained and operated Jointly by State and County at Broken Bow. Excellent cooperation on the part of the County Board makes this possible and successful. Dawson County Dawson County is another one of the Counties located near the Platte River and has consequently taken advantage of local gravel for surfacing roads. During this biennium Project 39, nineteen miles in length, received a second coat of two inch gravel. In con - junction with the placing of this additional two inches, due primarily to dry weather, it was necessary to add a binder in order to hasten compaction and avoid having a surplus of gravel on the surface. The binder was obtained from the road ditches, placed on the surface and manipulated by a maintenance crew. This County is traversed from east to west by fifty-five miles of Lincoln Highway or Nebraska L". S. No. 30, which is entirely graveled but requires considerable attention in the way of maintenance on account of the heavy traffic. While soil conditions are considered favorable, dry weather and heavy traffic make good maintenance Project 25 2-A, seven miles in length, is nearing completion, grad - ing and drainage structures are now finished and three inches of gravel is being placed. This Project also received a new standard seventy foot span low truss bridge. State Aid Project 105, thirteen miles in length, from Cozad to Gothenburg is the cheapest and best road contracted for in the Dis - trict. Grading, structures and two inch gravel surfacing cost $1,350.00 per mile. All work being let by contract. All work is now completed and the road is in excellent condition. Dawson County is another County which takes advantage of the State Bridge Fund, and about a year ago completed a bridge and fill approaches across the Platte River just south of Cozad. Dawson County Commissioners never cease to want more road Im - provements, after all State Funds were exhausted they came with $50,000.00 to match with a like amount of Federal Funds for the construction of a standard bridge and approaches across the Platte River south of Gothenburg, which has been contracted for and con - struction started. This bridge is located on the Gothenburg-Farnam </seg>
            <seg id="p152">REPORT OF SECRETARY 150 State and Federal Highway which was just recently added to our system by the Government. Five one-man motor patrols provide the regular maintenance for the eighty-two miles of improved roads. One heavy tractor and blade outfit is kept busy working on the different patrols, reshaping and cleaning ditches. Considerable work was necessary the past year preparing the projects for gravel. . Blaine, Thomas, Hooker and Grant Counties The four counties noted have practically the same problems to face in the matter of road construction, therefore I will outline, in a general way, prevailing conditions. These counties are traversed by the Potash Highway or Highway No. 2, running from east to west, which undoubtedly sometime in the future, will be a very important Highway of the State and after its completion will receive a large percentage of the State's through travel. Located as it is, through the heart of the sandhill country, surrounded by numerous lakes which afford excellent hunting and fishing and lying adjacent to the Bessey Nebraska National Forest Reserve which is a vivid picture, clearly showing how land thought to be almost useless can be advantageously utilized, this highway offers several reasons why tourists would be amply justified in their desire to cross our State over this route. These counties are confronted with the proposition of clay sur - facing nearly every foot of their State and Federal system. Clay surfacing materials with suitable binding qualities are very scarce and necessitates long hauls on this material which consequently causes an increased cost of construction. Dry weather and wind are the elements which cause a clay surfaced road to deteriorate rapidly un - less a gravel wearing surface is provided shortly after the clay is placed. While at some points no local gravel is available, a recent Investigation of the gravel situation, shows that suitable gravel is obtainable within a reasonable distance and very reasonable prices on gravel surfacing can be anticipated. </seg>
            <seg id="p153">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 151 In the sand hills on the open ranges, the highway markers must be fenced for protection against cattle. The town of Ashby is in the distance. Out where the west has begun, the autoist is helpless on the sand trails which have not been surfaced with hay. </seg>
            <seg id="p154">152 REPORT OP SECRETARY One method of removing clay surfacing from old lake beds. Project No. 284- A Where once the covered wagon and oxen plodded slowly along, today the autolst burns up the highway through the barren sand hills on a clay surfaced boulevard. </seg>
            <seg id="p155">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 153 Due to a small apportionment of State and Federal Funds allotted to these counties and to the increased cost of construction on account of the clay surfacing required, rapid progress cannot be expected under the present system of financing. If the completion of this Highway is to be expected in the near future, some legislative action to provide more funds is necessary. Maintenance at present provides one man and four horses with a light blade, a hayrack and wagon for about each eighteen miles, which is a considerable distance to cover with horses. The patrol - men spend most of their time cutting and hauling hay on the sandy. trails and hauling clay a long distance on some sandy stretches which have been temporarily graded. While some temporary grading and clay surfacing has been done in the past, this biennium has seen the first standard construction of State and Federal Aid Highways which are listed below: Blaine County: Project 284-A, 7.5 miles in length, running from Dunning southeast through Linscott to the County line. Grading and six inch clay surfacing are nearing completion, funds were not avail - able for gravel surfacing. Thomas County: Project 2 SI- A beginning at Thedford and run - ning east six miles. Nearly complete excepting two inch gravel surfacing for which contract has been awarded. Local gravel will be used for the wearing surface. Hooker County: Project 8 0-B extends three miles east and three miles west of Hecla. This is probably the most objectionable stretch of sand on the Potash Highway and has caused considerable work and worry in an attempt to construct it at a reasonable cost. Bids have been received on several different types of wearing surfacing, concrete, asphalt, and clay-gravel. Concrete and asphalt bids were considerable in excess of funds available and clay bids for shipped in material or local material which had to be hauled an average of six miles were also prohibitive. After a prolonged investigation a clay material was located about two miles west and one mile south of Hecla. This material while very low in clay content, was con - sidered worth using in conjunction with a two inch gravel surfacing and on this basis the contract was awarded and the project is near - ing completion with fairly satisfactory results. Grant County: Project 80-A runs from Hyannis east seven miles; Project 277-A passes through the town of Hyannis to a point one mile west being about two and five-tenths miles in length. The prog - ress on these projects has been slowed up considerably on account </seg>
            <seg id="p156">154 REPORT OF SECRETARY of using wet material for surfacing but completion yet this year is anticipated. The contract has been awarded for grading, drain - age structures and two inch gravel surfacing. The country through which these improvements run is only graz - ing land of very little value. Large herds of cattle tramping around on the roads do considerable damage, therefore fencing of the High - way is very important. The land owners, on account of the cheap - ness of the land will not fence, therefore the County and State joint - ly are fencing all improved roads. Keith County Keith County has two important State Highways, the Lincoln Highway or Nebraska U. S. No. 30 running east and west through the County and the Platte Valley Highway or Nebraska U. S. No. 28 which follows the North Platte River. Another secondary State Highway No. 61 which leads to Arthur, an inland town well sur - rounded by sandhills, is of considerable importance to Arthur, being their only outlet to a railroad. Keith County's apportionment of State and Federal Aid is small as compared to the mileage of State and Federal Highways in tha County, therefore, the progress of Highway developments has been rather slow. Soil conditions vary considerably throughout the County. Along the river bottom the soil is an alkali gumbo and becomes very sandy as you leave the valley. Gravel deposits lie along the rivers in abundance, making it an easy matter to surface with gravel. All but five miles of the Platte Valley Highway has been built to a permanent grade but no gravel surfacing had been done until this year when seven miles from Ogalalla north received two inches of gravel surfacing. Project 2 2 4-C, five miles long and just east of Big Springs and on the Lincoln Highway was just recently completed, being graded and graveled. A contract was awarded for construction of grading, drainage structures and gravel for twelve miles on the Lincoln Highway from Roscoe to Paxton. Work on this section has just started. The regular maintenance of the sixty-eight miles of improved roads is cared for by two one-man maintainer type, two light tractors with wood drags and two team patrols. In addition to these a heavy tractor and blade outfit is used for special maintenance work. Con - siderable construction work has been done the past year by main - tenance forces. Approximately twenty-five miles have been blade graded to a good temporary grade, and clay surfacing was placed </seg>

Through the courtesy of the County Board the State is permitted to use the County's equipment yard and patrol shed at Ogalalla where equipment is stored and minor repair work done. Lincoln County Lincoln County with its one hundred and fifty-three miles of State and Federal Highways, with both the North and South Platte Rivers, and with widely varying soil from the sandiest to the toughest gumbo is very much appreciative of the benefits derived for State and Fed - eral Aid. While Lincoln County has numerous natural hazards to overcome in the progress of Highway construction, it is blessed with an unlimited supply of natural road gravel which is easily obtained from either the North or South Platte Rivers. The Lincoln Highway which is coincident with Nebraska U. S. No. 30 crosses the County from east to west through a low country adjacent to the Platte River and with a widely varying soil, main - tenance becomes a big problem. This Highway with the exception of nine miles is gravel surfaced ,and it is the present plan to construct this section next year. Construction during this biennium has been of considerable magnitude in Lincoln County. Two Platte River bridges and ap - proach fills have been contracted for and completed: One, seven hundred and forty feet long across the North Platte River north of North Platte on Highway No. 28, being financed by local contributions, County Funds, City Funds and fifty per cent Federal Aid. Another, eight hundred and thirty feet long across the Platte River located on a County road south of Brady Island, this being financed by fifty per cent State Aid Bridge Funds and fifty per cent County Bridge District Bond Issue. In the way of Highway improvements, other than river bridges, with State and Federal Funds, four Projects have been contracted for and are nearly completed. Project 221 from North Platte south to May wood was let under two separate contracts: Project 2 21-B, fifteen and one-half miles in length being graveled with two inch gravel; Project 221-C from the end of Project 221-B south to the County line, a distance of twenty miles, is now under construction and approximately fifty per cent complete, contract being awarded for grading, two inch gravel and drainage structures. When this Project is completed it will </seg>
            <seg id="p158">156 REPORT OF SECRETARY give North Platte a hard surfaced road south to the County line distance of forty miles. Project 2 33-B, on which contract has been awarded for grading, drainage structures and two inch gravel surfacing and is now under construction, extends from the north City limits of North Platte, a distance of six miles, towards Tryon. This is an important piece of construction as it is a start in closing a thirty-eight mile gap through the sand hills, which separates the inland town of Tryon, located in the heart of the sandhills, from good railroad facilities. Project 298-A begins just north of North Platte and continues north towards Stapleton a distance of six miles. Work is well under way on this project for which contract has been awarded for grading, drainage structures and two inch gravel surfacing. Of the one hundred and fifty-three miles of State Highway only one hundred and twelve are improved and under regular mainten - ance. The regular maintenance patrols consist of five one-man main - tainer type, one team and two heavy duty trucks, and each patrol has the occasional assistance of a heavy tractor and blade outfit. In connection with the maintenance work a remarkable improvement was made on Old Project No. 10, from North Platte to Sutherland, a distance of twenty miles, which was originally constructed with a twenty foot roadway and was recently widened to approximately a twenty-six foot roadway by the maintenance force. The maintenance force also graded six miles of Highway in the northeast corner of the County, making a good road out of what was previously only a trail. A well equipped machine shop and equipment yard is op - erated jointly by the County and State, which has worked out very satisfactorily. McPherson County McPherson County is an inland county with Tryon as its County Seat, the only town in the County and which is located approximately in the center, therefore, good roads are essential to its existence. This being another County in the sandhills, the improved roads with little exception must be clayed. This County has two State-Federal Highways, one. Highway No. 27 which begins at Tryon and runs east to the County line a distance of twenty miles, and Highway No. 28 beginning on Highway No. 27, fonr miles east of Tryon runs south to the County line toward North Platte. Previous to this biennium Projects 111- A and 111-B, twelve miles long were constructed with State and Federal Funds. At the time </seg>
            <seg id="p159">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 157 of construction of Project 111- A a poor quality of clay surfacing material and improper maintenance since its construction, caused 2.5 miles of this Project to become deteriorated to such an extent that a contract has been let for its re-construction. In addition to the 2.5 miles mentioned above, Project 111-C, two miles long has been built with State and Federal Funds and Project 233-C, five miles long is now under construction. Upon the completion of Project 111-C, Try on has an improved Highway to the railroad at Stapleton, twenty-six miles east. The beginning of Project 233-C is a start in getting an improved High - way from Tryon to North Platte, a distance of thirty-five miles. Regular maintenance in this County consists of two-four horse team patrols, who care for the twenty miles of improved road. A heavy tractor and blade outfit is operated jointly between Logan and McPherson Counties. It will be necessary to add another patrol next year to maintain the road now being improved. Logan County Logan County is the dividing line east and west between the sand hill country and the better soil country. The northwest half of the County is sandy while the southeast half varies from a light sandy clay to a heavier clay, which is a good road soil. This County has two State and Federal Highways. One High - way No. 27 crosses the county from east to west and has all been graded so as to furnish a good serviceable road. Highway No. 23 begins at Stapleton and runs southeast towards North Platte. Project 96-D located between Gandy and Stapleton, a distance of 3.5 miles is under construction and practically complete except two inch gravel wearing surface. The maintenance force consists of one heavy duty truck and drag patrol, one four horse team patrol, and two temporary team patrols. A heavy tractor and blade outfit is also used part time for dressing up the ditches and grading unimproved roads. From Gandy east to the County line prior to this year was only a trail but this section, fourteen miles long, has been graded up to a temporary grade, and a like improvement was made from Stapleton south to the County line, a distance of six miles. On these sections only temporary patrols are used, working when necessary in order to provide the best road possible with funds available. </seg>

            <seg id="p162">160 REPORT OP SECRETARY Federal and State Aid has been confined to the eastern part of the county, where heavy and costly construction is necessary to produce an all weather road. During this biennium two Federal Aid Projects have been completed in Boyd County. Project 14-C, on Highway No. 8, from the Whiting Bridge north three and a half miles, made a notable improvement; from a winding trail of exces - sively steep grades up the Niobrara Bluffs, this has become a road of pleasant alignment and easy gradient. Project 280-C completes Highway No. 12 in the extreme east end of the county. It was an expensive piece of construction, not only because of the heavy grading involved, but because of the large number of drainage structures required, which in addition to a 160 foot steel bridge, included many large concrete culerts. The balance of Boyd County State Highways have been put to a temporary grade and were well maintained at all seasons. The maintenance has been handled by four tractor patrols, located at Lynch, Spencer, Butte and Naper, covering the entire state highway system in the county. Through the assistance of the County Board several improvements in alignment have been made, with a view to better accommodate the increasingly heavy traffic until these roads can be constructed as Federal Aid Projects. Brown County Brown County, while generally thought of as a sand hill county, has many canyons and creeks which offer a decided change in scenery from the monotony one ordinarily expects in the sand hills. One development along Pine Creek is already receiving considerable men - tion as a summer resort and each year is attracting more and more visitors, who wish to spend a week or two among the pines. There are many points along the Niobrara River, Pine and Plum Creeks which, with a little developing, will make ideal camping spots in the future. As the highways continue to improve and people lose their old time dread of a trip through the sand hills, these places will come into their own, and be a decided attraction for tourists. Since the sand trails are the ones most in need of improvement, Brown County has put the greater part of its funds into constructing these roads. Project 238-A, graded and clay surfaced this year, has converted eight and a half miles of sand trail between Ainsworth and the Niobrara River into a speedway. It has made a much needed Improvement on the road over which much of the hauling is done to Springview, the inland county seat of Keya Paha County. Project 89-A extends four and a half miles south of Long Pine, and is the first step towards opening a constructed road to the south. </seg>

            <seg id="p164">162 REPORT OF SECRETARY This route, for approximately twenty-five miles, lies through the ■and hills, and it will be several years before sufficient funds are available to build it throughout. Much of the unconstructed portion of Brown County State High- Cs lies in the sand hills, but, wherever the soil is suitable, a porary grade has been bladed up and by constant maintenance the graded roads have been kept in good condition at all times. The sand trails have been kept hayed, which at least keeps the sand pass - able until such time as it will be possible to build a more perman - ent road. The County Board and the people of the county have been very active in highway work, and are eager to see that these trails are converted into highways at the earliest possible time. Cherry County A few years ago the name of Cherry County was, to many of us, synonomous with sandy waste and desert land. However, Cherry County is by no means all sand, as more and more tourists are learning each year. A person crossing the county on Highway No. 20 still finds a little trail road, but he is agreeably surprised, especially if he knew the country in earlier years or has been listening to tales told by those who visited the county some time ago. In the fall, Cherry County is the Mecca for duck hunters from all parts of this and adjoining states. The many little lakes and ponds hidden among the sand hills, harbor native ducks of all varieties, and serve as a convenient stop-over for northern water fowl on their winter migration to the south land. The bills themselves abound with prairie chicken, so that during the open season we see car after car of khaki clad hunters coming in for a few days sport-following the State Highway to some chosen point and then leaving it and striking off into the hills over the winding sand trails. This biennium has seen the completion of forty-five miles of State Highway in Cherry County, with a contract let and work in progress on an additional fourteen miles. Much of this construction has been through sand and the roadway has had to be topped with clay to pro - vide a wearing surface. Of the forty-five miles completed, twelve west of Merriman have been graveled, making an all weather road of it, as well as insuring a longer life for the surfacing. Highway construction is doing much to bring the East and West of Cherry County closer together, not alone in permitting faster travel but also in shortening the distance by line changes and relocations. Where trails used to wind around the hills, highways cut through; where the undeveloped roads went miles out of their way to avoid lakes and sloughs, highways go straight across. The result Is that </seg>

The long almost impassable sand trails give way to the short straight clay surfaced and graveled highways. </seg>
            <seg id="p166">164 REPORT OP SECRETARY On the unconstructed portions of the State Highway system, a temporary grade has been bladed up wherever soil conditions warrant It. The county has taken a great interest in the State's highway program and much of its success in the county has been due to the assistance giren by the Board of Commissioners, who have done every - thing to help further the work. Garfleld County All Federal and State Aid road construction in Garfield County has been from Burwell north. The two Projects completed in the previous biennium, numbers 34-A and B, extending approximately ten miles north of town, brought the constructed road up to the sand hills. Project 3 4-C, completed this year, carried the highway through six miles of bad sand and brought construction to within seven miles of the north county line. The State Highways in the southern part of the county, south and west from Burwell, roughly following the North Loup River, have been bladed up to a temporary grade, and the soil is such that it forms an excellent road with just ordinary maintenance. For this reason the County Board has asked that all available funds be ex - pended in constructing the north road through the sand, where the improvement is greatly needed. This road serves a large territory, not only as a local trade road but as a through route. It will develop also into a tourist route, for a few miles north of the county line it passes Swan Lake which in time will be developed as a camper's resort and is now well known by the devotees of the piscatorial sport. The maintenance in Garfield County has been satisfactorily handled by two patrols; a motor patrol at Burwell and a team patrol on the far end of the north road. As in all sand hill counties the maintenance on the sand trails has consisted of haying, a temporary expedient to keep the roads passable. Holt County Holt County, with a very large mileage of State and Federal roads,. lies just on the east edge of the sand hills. While some of its natural soil is good road material, much of it is too sandy to stand alone and has to be surfaced with clay, adding greatly to the cost of road construction. During this biennium there has been a large amount of highway edone in Holt County. Project 200-A, from O'Neill to Ewing, a ce of twenty-eight miles, was graded and clay surfaced, and and a half miles were graveled. Five and a half miles of the </seg>
            <seg id="p167">DEPARTMENT OF* PUBLIC WORKS 165 project finished south of Ewing during the last bienninm Is being graveled, and under favorable weather conditions, will be completed this winter. A notable improvement was made in Highway No. 20, west of O'Neill. Where the old road followed the section lines, making many sharp right angle turns, crossing the railroad twice and striking a little sand in the thirty-four miles to Stuart, the new route parallels the railroad on the north side for practically the entire distance. It eliminates the railroad crossings, which are always a menace to traffic; it avoids all but two of the right angle turns and these have been built as long, easy curves; it shortens the distance between O'Neill and Stuart by about five miles, which in itself is an Important im - provement. Eighteen miles of this road, from O'Neill to Atkinson, were graded as a Federal Aid Project, while the balance of the distance to Stuart was put to a temporary grade. Much of the soil going to make up this road contains sufficient natural gravel to give the finished highway the qualities of a gravel road. The road from O'Neill, south to Bartlett, was added to the Federal system during the biennium and is eligible for Federal Aid construction when funds are available. This road, in addition to its importance as a link in a through north and south route, will serve a good agri - cultural district in the south part of the county. This highway also passes near Goose Lake, which is now owned by the State and will probably be developed in the future. All graveling done in the county has been with local material. An extensive pumping pit was opened at Stuart, and two small pits were opened east of O'Neill. The presence of such local gravel, suitable for road surfacing, assures the county of many miles of gravel highway in the future. With a continuation of the sentiment favoring better highways, that has been evidenced in the county these past two years, it will be but a short time until the State system is graveled from east to west and north to south across the county. Keya Paha County Keya Paha County, having no railroad, must look to its highways to solve its transportation problems. The closest railroad points are Bassett in Rock County and Ainsworth in Brown County, separated in each instance from Keya Paha County by a stretch of sand hills and the Niobrara River. The river crossings were completed during the previous biennium so that for the past two years, attention has been given entirely to the east and west road, Highway No. 20. </seg>
            <seg id="p168">166 REPORT OF SECRETARY Approximately fifteen miles, between Springriew and Norden, were constructed as Federal Aid Project 267-A. Much of this road was built up of a soil composed of clay and gravel which combines to make an excellent highway, having most of the qualifications of a graveled surface. With the exception of eight miles, the State Highway system in the county is built to either a permanent or a temporary grade, and the entire system has been under regular maintenance. Four team patrols and one tractor patrol have kept the roads in good condi - tion, and the people of Keya Paha County, noting the added ease of hauling and driving over an improved road, have become strong boosters for everything that will help the Good Road Movement. A Beautiful Winding Highway Is Project 197-A Skirting the canyons and following the divides in and out among the pines. Knox County Knox county is one of hills and streams and due to topography of this kind, road improvement is expensive. It involves the making of deep cuts and high fills, and the construction of many large bridges and culverts, which raise the cost per mile of road built. Many ex - pedients are employed to keep this cost as low as consistent with </seg>
            <seg id="p169">DEPARTMENT OP PUBLIC WORKS 167 good construction, one of which is seen in the substitution of creo - soted timber bridges for steel structures on the project completed last year north of Center. Nine and a half miles of grading has been completed during the biennium on Highway No. 81, in the eastern part of the County. This was Federal Aid construction and consisted of Projects 136-C and 294-A, extending from the south county line to about five miles north of Wausa. This, in addition to being a state highway, is also the route of the Meridian highway through Knox County, and, as such, it carries much interstate and tourist traffic. A State Aid bridge is being built across the Niobrara River in the west end of the county. It is to replace an old timber structure built in 1885 by the United States Government to connect the San tee and Ponca Indian agencies. A bridge is no longer essential to the Indians, and modern traffic demands a more substantial structure than that erected years ago to accommodate the ox carts and covered wagons. The new bridge will consist of seven 100 foot steel spans, with 18 foot roadway, concrete floors, and concrete piers and abut - ments, forming a decided contrast to the timber trusses and piers of the old bridge. All unconstructed portions of the State Highway System have been put to a temporary grade and kept under maintenance. This was handled by six tractor patrols, and in spite of the many drainage problems that can be solved only by construction, the roads were all kept in good condition. Much credit is due the County Board for their assistance in this work, for they have cooperated in every way to further the State Highway Program. Loup County Loup County lies well within the sand hills and most of its State Highways were sand roads. This is particularly true of Highway No. 10, the north and bouth route. Highway No. 11, running east from Taylor, follows the Loup River, and the soil although light stands up under traffic without surfacing. For this reason the east road has been brought only to a temporary grade, while the County Board has requested that all construction funds be spent on the north road. The grading and claying on Highway No. 10 from the south county line to the Calamus River, fourteen miles north of Taylor, have been completed and graveling on this piece of road is now in progress. Local gravel pumped from the Loup and Calamus Rivers is being used satisfactorily for the surfacing, and the presence of such road </seg>
            <seg id="p170">168 REPORT OF SECRETARY material in the County will be a big help in future road improvement. The fact that the county has no railroad makes the condition of the highways of the utmost importance. The people and county of - ficials, realizing this, have aided the State's program in every way, and are enjoying the benefits that inevitably result from co-operation In highway work. The maintenance has been handled by two regular patrols work - ing out of Taylor, one equipped with a truck and the other a tractor one-man maintainer. These have kept the graded highways in good condition, . while a temporary team patrol in the north end of the county took care of the sand trails, haying them when needed. Rock County Rock County has a large mileage of State and Federal Roads, only seventeen miles of which have been brought to a permanent grade. Material suitable for road construction is scarce in the county and construction costs have been high, with the result that but few miles resulted from a large expenditure. Project 168-B, from Bassett to the east county line, graded and clayed in 1923, passes through some exceptionally fine hay lands. For a few months in the fall heavy loads of hay are hauled over the highway to the shipping points of Bassett and Newport, and the narrow iron tires of the hay wagons have proved very destructive to the clay surfacing. Newport is frequently given credit for. being the greatest hay shipping point in the world. It required costly main - tenance work each year to replace the clay that would be loosened and blown away. This year, after reclaying much of the project, a contract was let for gravel. The county now has sixteen miles of ex - cellent gravel road, well able to stand the abuse to which it is subjected during the haying season. The road between Bassett and Long Pine was brought to a temp - orary grade and the sandiest stretches clayed, so as to make a service - able highway between these towns until such time as it can be built as a Federal Aid Project. This was a much needed improvement, for it was the longest piece of trail road east of Valentine on Highway No. 20. The State Highway northwest of Bassett carries much of the freighting to Springview, the inland county seat of Keya Paha County, There has been no contract construction work on it this biennium, however out of the maintenance fund this year, four miles were graded up and clayed. </seg>
            <seg id="p171">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 169 Due to the necessary amount of clay hauling, the maintenance has been handled principally with teams, using six patrols. After the gravel was placed east of Bassett, a tractor one-man maintainer was added to the equipment for use on the surfaced road. Wheeler County Wheeler County, like many in the sand hills, has to depend large - ly on its highways because of the lack of railroad facilities. Bartlett, the county seat, is an inland town, with highway connections to the railroad at Ericson in the southwest corner of the county, and Spalding in Greeley County. Since the natural soil is too sandy to stand up under traffic, practically all highway construction involves clay sur - facing, and for that reason is expensive. There has been but one Federal Aid Project in the County. That was southeast from Bartlett for a distance of thirteen and a halt miles toward Spalding, on which construction was completed this year. The State Highway from Bartlett to Ericson has been graded up, and each year a little more clay is added from maintenance, until now the road is in good condition for most of its length, and well able to care for the heavy hauling to which it is subjected. The maintenance in the county was handled with team patrols entirely until the completion of the project at Bartlett, when a tractor one-man maintainer was added. Until these roads are graveled, main - tenance is largely a matter of hauling more clay to replace that which blows and washes away, so that team patrols are found to be the most practical to use. </seg>

            <seg id="p186">DEPARTMENT OP PUBLIC WORKS DIVISION OP TESTS Prof. C. M. Duff of the Nebraska State University is the Materials and Testing Engineer in charge of the analysis and tests of all mater - ials used in the construction of State and Federal Aid roads and bridges. This includes Portland cement, sand, sandgravel, gravel, crushed rock, concrete, steel reinforcing, bars, concrete and corrugated pipe, oils, paint, asphalts, tars and paving materials. View of Concrete Core Drilling Machine In operation on a concrete pavement 7 inches thick. Fifteen minutes time is required to cut one core but an additional 30 minutes is lost in moving and setting up This testing is done under an agreement between the Department of Public Works and the State University by the terms of which the University furnishes the equipment and personnel for making tests. Payments are made for these tests by the Department direct to the University, such payments being based upon an agreed price for each test. In addition to analyzing and testing recommendations are made as to the advisibility of using such materials. Reports and recom - mendations are made to the Chief of the Bureau of Roads and Bridges for his consideration and action. Analysis of all tests are mailed at once to the Federal District Engineer's office. No materials are used that do not meet the requirements of the Standard Specifications of the State and Federal Government. </seg>
            <seg id="p187">REPORT OP SECRETARY The principle object in view in the testing and analyzing of mater - ials used, or proposed to be used in the construction of State and Federal Aid roads and bridges is for the purpose of determining their suitability for this use. The materials are tested to determine whether or not they meet with the requirments of the specificaions. No special research appropriation has been made, however considerable has been accomplished through a study of the records of tests made and also through careful financing and extra labor donated the de - partment has been able to start a thorough investigation into concrete pipe and gravel roads. The investigation into gravel roads has been referred to earlier in this report under the subject "Gravel Roads." During the past year over 60 reinforced concrete pipes varying in size Pi 18 inches to 48 inches manufactured by ten different companies i been tested as a research work exclusive of the regular culvert ng routine. A study is being made regarding the strength as a &gt;r of shell thickness, amount and location of reinforcing. The ent specifications require a double line of reinforcing. A typical laboratory failure of single line re-inforced concrete pipe. 36 inch pipe crushed under load of 10,335 lbs. The methods used for conducting all of the tests and analysis of materials are as provided by the United States Department of Agricul - ture, Department Bulletin No. 1216, "Tentative Standard Methods of Sampling &amp; Testing Highway Materials" and by the American Society for Testing Materials. </seg>
            <seg id="p188">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 185 A typical laboratory failure of double line re-inforced concrete pipe. 48 inch concrete pipe crushed under load of 28,255 lbs. On account of the lack of a sufficient equantity of good commercial rock to be used as concrete aggregate, it has been necessary to design a concrete made of sand-gravel aggregate. Nebraska has a large num - ber of deposits of this material, which when of the right analysis, makes an excellent aggregate for concrete. A large number of tests have been made on the sand-gravel aggregate, which determine those particular characteristics which it must have in order to make the best concrete. In parallel with the sand-gravel tests, two concrete cylinders six inches in diameter and twelve inches long are moulded for each day's run of concrete pavement, concrete pavement base, concrete curb and gutter mixtures, and concrete bridges. Records are kept of the com - pressive strength of these concrete cylinders at the ages of seven and the twenty-eight days. Together with these tests are recorded the complete physical test for the Portland Cement and sand gravel aggre - gate used in the mixture on the job from which the concrete cylinders' are taken. All of the laboratory testing and analyzing is made in the engineer - ing laboratories at the University of Nebraska, except when certain paving projects have a large number of materials to be tested. In such cases a temporary laboratory is set up for that purpose near the work. Very often tests are made at the manufacturer's plant on </seg>

On many projects the inspector makes his own tests on gravel, supplying the Federal Bureau with copies o (the analysis direct. This is also an economical method with great saving in time. Owing to the difficulties and delays in testing paint and creosote for generally small jobs and the difficulty in determining definitely that the proper materials are being used even if a supposedly rep - resentative sample has been tested, this Department adopted the policy of furnishing the contractors direct with paint and creosote for all state work. Under this plan the Department purchases the estimated years supply in advance, has delivery made in advance, has tests made on these deliveries and furnishes these supplies to all contractors practically at cost. This plan adopted this biennium has met with great success and will be continued in the future.

            <seg id="p190">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS DIVISION OF DESIGN, MAPS AND PLANS Under this Division of the Bureau, the Office Engineer is responsible for the preparation of all standard and special designs and plans for state and federal aid construction as well as standard plans for county bridge construction, standard county bridge specifications and State Federal Aid highway and bridge specifications, supplies and equip - ment for office and field engineers and all records of field surveys. Steps to a Federal Aid Highway The first step in the establishment of a Federal and State Aid road is the passage of a resolution by the County Commissioners giving a description of the road and requesting Federal Aid for its construction. This resolution is presented to the State Department, and after an investigation of the conditions, if found favorable, it is approved. Upon approval by the State Department, a propect statement is compiled and submitted to the United States Bureau of Public Roads. This statement contains a map showing the alignment of the pro - prosed road, an estimate of the approximate cost, the source of funds available and all other data necessary to inform the Federal Bureau of the most important factors. Preliminary survey is then made of the project by the State. The surveying party usually consists of three, project engineer, rodman and chairman. This survey establishes Kind of Material No. of Tests Remarks Culvert Metal 613 Guard Rail Cable Gravel 1211 In addition to these tests in the laboratory, many hundreds of ad- ditional field tests were made by engineers and inspectors on Paint the job. 67 A single check test is made in the State Laboratory upon the paint and Creosote inspected and ap- proved by the Department repre- sentative at the manufacturing plant.

            <seg id="p191">REPORT OP SECRETARY the status of the road in respect to alignment, drainage, and all es - sential defects or needs are determined. The notes taken by the en - gineer in the field are then reduced in the office by the draftsman and platted in plan, profile and cross sections. The plan of the road indicates the location of trees, fences, drive - ways, houses, telephone poles, and entire alignment. It is in fact an exact chart of the road showing the position of every land-mark and structure which is contingent. The profile of the road is plotted to show the elevation of the center line of the road throughout the entire length. Cross sections of the road are plotted wherever they have been taken by the engineer in the field. These sections are taken every hundred feet and at intervals between these hundred foot stations whenever the profile of the road changes abruptly enough to warrant it. Two draftsmen will complete about three miles of plotting in one day. A tentative grade is then laid on the profile by the draftsman in the office who studies the profile and establishes a grade which ap - proximately balances the cuts and fills, making the road conform as near as possible to the desired standard. These plans are then sent to the District Engineer, who in company with an Engineer from the Federal office, makes a plan-in-hand inspection of the road. This inspection covering the whole project, includes recommendations for all surfacing, grade and drainage structures. The plan-in-hand in - spection notes are then sent into the office and the former plan is revised. Using the plan-in-hand inspection notes as a working basis, a balanced grade is laid utilizing the dirt that has been obtained from hills and ditches in raising the low places and bringing the road to the desired grade and cross section. Earth work quantities are computed from the cross sections and an estimate of the required yardage is made. Drainage structures are designed according to the plan-in-hand inspection and estimates are made for the new project. These plans and estimates are then submitted to the Federal Government and after their approval, the State is at Liberty to award contracts for construction. After completion of construction a final survey is made of the road as built. This survey is made over the same stations as preliminary, the notes being plotted over the preliminary cross sections and the actual yardage of excavation and embankment determined. The completed project is inspected by Federal engineers and after their approval the final plans and estimates are submitted to the Federal Bureau for approval and payment. The following charts are self-explanatory showing standard crosa sections, progress of construction, state of completed and accepted projects, status of propects under construtcion and financial status </seg>

            <seg id="p227">REPORT OP SECRETARY STATE AID BRIDGES The State Aid Bridge law has made It possible for counties to build permanent structures across the larger streams in this state. Without State Aid it would be an unjust burden to these counties since the cost on these larger structures should be borne to some extent by the State at large thus relieving the local community unfortunately situated. The law originally provided that the minimum width of stream over which State Aid could be allowed for bridging was 175 feet. The 1921 Legislature reduced this length to 100 feet so that more counties could avail themselves of this aid. The following tabulations show all State Aid Bridge Appropriations, all State Aid bridges contracted previous to this biennium, and bridges which became State Aid through the Emergency and Relief Appropri - ation of the 1925 Legislature, and those contracted this biennium, also expenditures for repairs this biennium and applications remaining on file. Lack of county funds to meet State Aid when State Aid was available is the reason why many applications have remained on file for several years.

The high bid was $29,642.60. The Platte river is peculiar in several respects. As Mark Twain so ably described it, it is during several months of the year "A mile wide and an inch deep." At flood periods the discharge may exceed 35,000 cubic feet per second. The river bed is fine sand and gravel. This gravel bed generally extends down far below any depth desirable for piling support with an occasional seam of sandstone or hard clay through which a piling will penetrate. Experience has proven that the river varying from a quarter of a mile to a mile in width can be bridged satisfactorily without undue hazard with 500 feet to 1400 feet of bridge. The balance of the river is spanned by a sand fill surfaced with clay and gravel, and protected against wave action or steam wash by rip rap and jetties. A rather careful study is being made to determine the most ecomical type of bridge design for general use on the Platte as conditions across the state are much the same varying only in width of the stream or natural island formation de - termining the location of spans. The following drawings and pictures are indicative of the founda - tion materials and of the general types of State Aid Bridges placed over the Platte River. The present tendency of design is toward steel truss or transverse joist type with concrete floor and foundations in place of the heavier multiple concrete arches. One of the problems in Nebraska along the Platte and many other rivers is the protection of the stream banks against erosion. The four following views show a typical installation of the Woods Brothers' patented steel and tree retards which have been very successful. </seg>

            <seg id="p261">256 REPORT OF SECRETARY DIVISION OF ACCOUNTS AND RECORDS The accounting Engineer has general supervision over the work and duties of this division. The division has a working force in addition to the Accounting Engineer of three stenographers, one clerk-bookkeeper, 1 contract clerk, one vouchering clerk and one filing clerk. During the biennium it has been necessary to draft at various periods assistance from the Maps and Plans division in order to handle the work. In addition to handling the heaviest biennium of routine work that has been experienced by this division, a complete revision of the filing system was made. A card-index system was also established as a means of recording Federal Project agreements. A similar index was made as a means of recording Final Federal Vouchers. The division has acted as a clearing house of claims filed against contractors covering bills for material, labor and supplies incurred during construction work. Adjustment of these claims has taken such a great amount of time that a modification of the policy is recommended. One of the most important pieces of work during the biennium has been the execution of new Personal Surety rulings covering con - tracts awarded by the state through the department. Heretofore the personal surety bonds did not afford the state ample protection. The personal sureties under the new rulings must file in addition to a statement of their personal valuation, a complete legal description of all property listed in their personal valuation forms. This statement must also be certified to by the county clerk or Register of Deeds in the county where real estate is located, with an additional statement that the property as listed is free from all liens, monetary judgment, etc. Copies of these forms together with a copy of the contract is filed with the register of deeds as a lien against said property. This lien is released after the department is satisfied that all provisions of the contract have been satisfactorily complied with. ROUTINE WORK For the purpose of controlling expenditures, this Division takes the various appropriations made by the Legislature for the Depart - ment of Public Works and subdivides them into quarterly estimates. These quarterly estimates are then distributed among the various accounts in each fund and a careful check made each month to see that the expenditures are not being made in excess of the appropria - tion. Under the existing system of financing the Department of Public Works, the appropriations of the Legislature control the funds available, and all work is carried on with that fact in mind. </seg>

At the time of the letting of the contracts, all tabulations of bids are checked by this Division, the contracts checked and the Minutes of the Meeting taken. They are checked, one against the other and the following copies are made and distributed: four copies of the Minutes, four copies of the tabulation of the bids and ten copies of each contract. As there are often five contractors receiving contracts on one project, it means as high as fifty copies of the contracts are made on a project. The handling of the certified checks and arrangements for bonds are made in this office. Estimates on construction work are sent in by the Project Engineer each month, after they have been approved by the Dis - trict Engineers and the Chief of the Bureau, they are presented to this Division for payment. These estimates are placed on vouchers that distribute the cost of construction as it appears on the estimate and are sent to the contractor for signature. On some estimates, this requires as many as six vouchers. After these vouchers have been properly signed by the contractor, they are placed on file and as funds become available, this Division requests the Finance De - partment to pass them through for payment. All details of pay - ment such as claims against the contractor, the assignment of funds due him and etc., are handled by this Division. </seg>
            <seg id="p264">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS When the Department desires to make any piece of construction a Federal Aid project, a Project Statement is made up and three copies forwarded to the Federal Government, together with the necessary copies of preliminary estimates and all information re - quired by the Government before they will approve a project and sign a Project Agreement with the State. The estimates handed in by the Construction Division are made the basis of a voucher to the Federal Government in which the Fed - eral Government's share of the cost of construction on that parti - cular project is claimed. On each project, the Federal Government enters into an agreement with the State as to the extent that they will participate in the cost thereof, this is known as the Project Agreement. Accompanying the Project Agreement is a Project state - ment and estimate, or as it is called, a P. S. &amp; E. This P. S. &amp; E. limits the extent to which the Federal Government may be vouchered as to the various items of construction on the project. If an overrun is necessary in the cost of construction, a modified project agree - ment is requested from the Government. Whenever a Project Agreement is entered into with the Gov - ernment it is necessary to show that funds are available to meet the balance of the construction costs, that are not to be paid by the Federal Government. This is usually met by the appropriation of the State Legislature known as the "Appropriation of State Aid Con - struction to Meet Federal Aid" however, in some cases, the Counties and various sub-divisions of the State agree to furnish the necessary funds to meet Federal Aid. In cases such as these, this Division bills the county and collects the share of the cost of construction that is charged to the county. All payrolls and expense vouchers for employees in the Depart - ment are made up from the various report sheets handed in.

Fund No. 186 After the expenditure has been charged to the proper Bureau, Division and Fund, it is distributed among the different accounts under the fund as follows Salaries and Wages Supplies Lands and Building Public Improvements Fixed Charges Expenses Equipment Revolving Funds. Monthly payrolls for employees in the Lincoln office are made up from daily report sheets and salary warrants drawn on the different funds according to Division employed under. The Equipment Division "Temporary Help" payrolls are paid twice a month and are paid on an hourly basis. Preliminary Engineering payrolls are made up from daily survey cards of Preliminary Engineers and their helpers. Project Engineers and helpers payrolls are made from monthly reports of the Project Engineer and charged to the different projects worked on. Division Engineer payrolls are made up from weekly reports. All salaries are figured on a monthly basis. Project Engineers and Preliminary Engineers and helpers are allowed in addition to their salaries a sub - sistence allowance. Project Engineers hand in monthly statements known as R-19s, showing distribution of their time and expenses. These are combined on, what is known as the Distribution sheet and this in turn is made the basis of a payroll voucher, which is passed through for payment of the cost of the engineering on the various projects. Heads of the different Divisions while away from Headquarters are allowed a flat subsistence rate, covering their meals. Receipts are not required to cover same. For all other expenses incurred, they are required to have receipts, same to be attached to expense voucher. Project Engineers are required to make up one set of expense vouchers, monthly for expenses of self and helpers and these are prorated to different projects, according to amount spent on same. These vouchers are checked by District Engineers in charge of the District worked in and then are forwarded to the Lincoln office for final check and approval. </seg>

AH stenographic work, including correspondence and filing with reference to road and bridge work is taken care of by this Division. All requisitions for all Divisions of the Department of Public Works are made by this Division, checked, sent to the Purchasing Agent of the Department of Finance. The Purchasing Agent then makes up the purchase orders and vouchers covering these requisi - tions and we again check and forward them for payment as soon as equipment and supplies are received. Cost data of maintenance done by the counties on the State High - way System throughout the entire state, is kept by this Division. This data is kept separately for each patrol in the different counties. All miscellaneous expenses as light, heat, rent and supplies of all kinds are vouchered and paid for through this division. ing the biennium to date the Department of Public Works placed under contract approximately ten million dollars worth of work. There is every indication that this amount will increase rather than decrease, and along with it, the duties of the Department. In order that the Department may function economically, a unified system of the accounts and records is a necessity. This should in - clude a continuous audit of accounts, revealing expenses and costs in detail to be used as a working guide in keeping the various items of expense to a minimum, together with a comprehensive and in - telligent set of records that could be used as a basis for planning work in the future. REPORT OP THE DIVISION OP ROAD EQUIPMENT On February 28th, 19 IS, Congress passed an amendment to the original Federal Aid Road Bill, designated as Section Seven, which provided for the transfer by the Secretary of War of all surplus war equipment materials and supplies not needed by the War Depart - ment, but suitable for use in the improvement of highways, to the highway departments of the several states, to be used on roads con - structed entirely or in part with Federal Aid Funds; such distribu - tion to be made upon a value basis, the same as provided for by the Federal Aid Road Act. The Department, realizing the importance of such equipment in building and maintaining roads, immediately gave definite instruc - tions to the War Department for shipment of Nebraska's share, and </seg>
            <seg id="p267">REPORT OF SECRETARY at the same time organized an Equipment Division which should have direct control and supervision of such materials. The Equipment Division's store room, garage and general equip - ment yard is located at Sixth and South Streets, Lincoln, Nebraska, where all supplies are stored, issued and shipped. The yard, cover - ing eleven acres, is fenced and a railroad spur, used for loading and unloading, runs the full length of one side. A large "A" frame crano stands on this track and facilitates the handling of shipments. The storeroom, in which all parts are kept, is located in the garage building. Doors leading to the storeroom are locked except when storekeeper is shipping or receiving supplies. As parts for the various types of equipment are received for stock, they are placed in bins or on shelves which are numbered and the quantity, description and location entered upon stock record cards. These cards, approximately six thousand in numbeer, give detailed information as to the application of the various parts carried in stock. When an issue or shipment of parts is made, a shipping ticket is executed showing the consignee, quantity and description of the article or articles, and method of shipment or delivery. The original of this form is used for invoicing and then filed, while the duplicate copy is forwarded to the consignee. The storekeeper posts the shipping tickets to the stock record cards and computes the balance of each item on hand. By this method a perpetual inventory of re - pair parts is kept, it being necessary only to refer to the stock record cards to determine the quantity of each item in stock. In addition to its various other function, the Equipment Division has been called upon to act as a distributing agency for paint and creosote. In 1925 bids were taken on the various grades of paint and creosote required for use on state and federal bridge and guard rail projects. This material was built in accordance with the de - partment's specifications and contractors are required to use it ex - clusively where they are engaged in state work. The result has been a reduction in cost to the state and a very marked Increase in the uniformity of the finished work. This division is reimbursed for materials supplied on the basis of cost plus handling and carrying charges. The cost of paint and creosote handled since this plan was inaugurated totals $28,510.00. During the past six months the same plan has been adopted in procuring and handling high explosives, except that surplus govern - ment material has been purchased in lieu of commercial stock. Shipments are received in carload quantities and distribution made </seg>
            <seg id="p268">DEPARTMENT OP PUBLIC WORKS to the various highway districts throughout the state. This explosive is used for clearing roadways of trees, for stream channel blasting, protecting river bridges from dangerous ice jams and for miscellaneous road work which the maintenance division is called upon to care for. The plan of handling explosive differs from that of paint in that it is not the policy of the department to supply individual contractors with this material. It is secured for the use of the state highway - maintenance organization and the quantity purchase method has reduced the cost to approximately one-half on the average through - out the state. Pursuant to an act of the 1925 state legislature, the Department of Public Works assumed responsibility for the proper maintenance of the entire state highway system on January 1st, 1926. One of the first problems that confronted those charged with the execution of the provisions of the new law was the procurement of sufficient additional road maintenance equipment to properly augment that taken over from the counties. A plan was conceived whereby the major portion of the needed equipment was purchased with money from the State Equipment and Material Fund with the provision that reimbursement should be made from the Maintenance Fund thru the annual payment of depreciation on the equipment so pur - chased. This method spreads the cost of new equipment over a period of years for the Maintenance Division and makes use of a large portion of the Equipment Division's cash fund for which there is no other immediate need. The amount of money expended by this Division to date for the purchase of equipment under this arrangement is $243,616.63. In addition to the equipment described above, government trucks and tractors to the estimated value of $70,000.00 have been condi - tioned and distributed for use on the state highway system during the last twelve months. During the past season two mobile sand blasting and spray paint - ing outfits have been developed to care for the renovating and re - painting of the bridges and guard rail on tb« state highway system, which are in need of such attention. Each outfit is mounted on a large truok chassis and consists of a 110 cu. ft. air compressor, a 2,000 lb. capacity sand blasting unit and a two-operator spray paint - ing unit. The trucks are equipped to carry a supply of paint, sand, gasoline and oil, together' with the various small articles necessary to the efficient operation of the equipment in the field and the proper execution of the work. The crews operating these sand blast and paint outfits have been called upon to perform varying classes of work and this year's experience is doing both the cleaning and painting </seg>
            <seg id="p269">264 REPORT OF SECRETARY with air has proven the economy of this method. The record out - put of one crew for one ten hour day was one coat of paint applied to 2,000 lineal feet of guard rail. Since March 1st, 1926, housing and shop facilities have been furnish by the equipment Division at the Sixth and South Street yard for the organization charged with the maintenance of state highways in Lancaster County. During the past two years much of the surplus material of ques - tionable value, which this division has possessed for several years, was liquidated by advertisement and sale to the highest bidder, in accordance with law. The personnel of the Division of Road Equipment has been re - duced from twenty-three employees on November 30th, 1924, to six employees on November 30th, 1926.

            <seg id="p287">REPORT OF SECRETARY Bridgeport, Nebraska, November 30, 1926. Mr. R. L. Cochran State Engineer, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: I have the pleasure of submitting herewith a brief statement covering matters pertaining to the activities of the office during the past biennium. Water Supply. E'he water supply of the North Platte and Platte rivers was suf - it to meet the demands of the past two seasons, although there an acute situation during July of 1925, for a period of two weeks which required the closing of projects having priorities later than June 26, 1894, to supply the Dawson County Canal. Considerable time has been devoted, in the past two years, to the study of the water distribution of the North Platte and Platte Rivers. The flow of the North Platte River has increased gradually since 1911 and has now reached a surprisingly large quantity. Prac - tically all the legal demands for water during the 1926 season were supplied with natural or percolating water. At no time during 1926 was the Platte River dry at Central City. From May to September, 1926 inclusive, 1,288,776 acre feet passed Overton unused. The amount of water coming to the State, measured at Torrington, Wyoming, during May to September inclusive, was 1,031,211 acre feet divided as follows: 495,050 acre feet original water passed through the Pathfinder Reservoir, the balance, 536,161 acre feet, was percolating water and storage released from the Path - finder Reservoir. After all projects were supplied there was more water at Overton, unused, than the amount which flowed across the Wyoming Line in the season of 1926. The amount of water diverted from the river by canals in Nebraska aggregated 764,824 acre feet, not including 746,563 acre feet which were diverted by the Ft. Laramie and Inter - state Canals at Whalen, Wyoming. Water Administration. The demand exceeded the supply during both seasons of the present biennium along the Frenchman and Republican Rivers. Water </seg>
            <seg id="p288">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS Commissioner, P. M. Whitehead, found it necessary to file ' a com - plaint with the County Attorney against a water user who persistently interfered with closed headgates in 1925, the case was later dis - missed. Another complaint was filed in 1926 against a water user who opened his gate after it was closed by the Water Commissioner. This case is still pending in the County Court. The distribution of the Lodgepole Creek water was satisfactorily administered by Water Commissioners S. B. Hanna and Charles H. Gardner. The streams in the Northwest corner of the State were super - vised by John D. Heywood, Water Superintendent, with very little friction. During July of 1925, the water situation on the Platte River was somewhat acute. Water Commissioner, R. F. Nosky, devoted his entire attention during that period to dividing the available water supply among the various projects east of North Platte. Water Commissioners The duties of Water Commissioner have been increased in the past ten years. The Irrigable area has approximately doubled in that time, requiring considerable more water, hence additional demand on the Water Commissioners' time. During the present biennium the demand for the services of the Water Commissioners was very noticeable. The funds for this purpose were used up entirely at the end of August which necessitated the dismissal of our regularly em - ployed Hydrographers, all but five river Observers and all of the Water Commissioners for the balance of the fiscal year. This action resulted in a break in our record of a long period of years of the flow of streams, especially the Platte Rivers. The salary of Water Com - missioners is insufficient and should be raised to six dollars per day. Observers It is necessary to maintain gaging station on many of our streams, especially the Platte Rivers. Every gaging station requires an Ob - server or an automatic recorder, and in some cases both are necessary. Nebraska maintained a gaging station on the North Platte River at Torrington, Wyoming, in order to ascertain the amount of water coming into Nebraska. However, this station was discontinued, with reluctance, on October first for want of funds. It is desirable to have an accurate and continuous record of the rise and fall of the river at all the gaging stations. For this purpose </seg>
            <seg id="p289">284 REPORT OF SECRETARY automatic recorders should be installed at Mitchell and North Platte, later on other gaging stations should be equipped with automatic recorders. On the South Platte Aiver at Julesburg, Colorado, an Interstate gaging station was established under the provisions of the Colorado- Nebraska South Platte River Compact. Two automatic recorders are used, one furnished by the State of Colorado and the other by Ne - braska. In addition to the automatic recorders an Observer is em - ployed to take daily gage heights, his services are paid jointly by the two States. Hydrography The hydrographical work carried on in Nebraska under the plan adopted in 1915, has resulted in an accumulation of valuable data pertaining to the flow of the streams in the State. One Hydrographer is employed throughout the entire year; one Hydrographer from March 1st to September 30th, and one office man is used part time on hydrographical work and computing current meter notes. Stream measurements are published elsewhere in this report. Canal measurements and daily discharges are not being published but are preserved in the files of the office for reference. Prom Sep - tember 30, 1924, to September 30, 1926, six thousand one hundred ninety one (6191) measurements were made at a cost of $2.2 S each. Irrigation Districts Three irrigation districts were formed during the past biennium: Petition for the formation of the Pathfinder Irrigation District under the North Platte Project, situated in Scottsbluff, Morrill and Sioux Counties, was approved by the Department April 27, 1926. The Hooper Irrigation District, including land under Docket 781, Hooper Canal; Docket 788, Graf Canal and Docket 795, the High Line Canal, and sometimes known as the Blue Creek Canal, was approved by the Department April 20, 1926. The Calamus Irrigation District which is located in Loup County, about five miles from Burwell, which is the nearest railroad point. This district was formed July 20, 1925, with an area of 9250 acres The water for this project will be taken from the Calamus River. </seg>
            <seg id="p290">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 285 Hearings Hearings were held on a number of appropriations which had not been used for many years. The hearing on the Delaware-Hickman appropriation was appealed from the District Court of Dundy County, where the department was reversed, to the Supreme Court where the District Court was affirmed. The following is a general summary of matters coming before the Department during the past two years: Stream and Canal Measurements 6191 Copying Records 488.15 $ 2460.85 \ Cooperation There are a few projects that have not shown any disposition to cooperate with the Department. Records of the daily water diversions are much needed in the administration and study of the water supply. Our disposition charts and tabulations of water supply are, while ap - proximately correct, not accurate for the reason that the amount of water diverted must be determined from occasional measurements, perhaps two weeks apart. Projects waste considerable water back to the stream, without the knowledge of the department, which is mistaken for return flow. A number of projects are taking water from sources other than the original source without informing the department. Applications Filed 123 Water Appropriations Permits Ill Water Appropriations Cancelled „ 42 Applications Dismissed 10 Applications Pending 30 Hearings Held 2 5 Relocation Permits 8 Water Power Leases 13 Deeds Recorded _ 9 Irrigation District Organized 3 Drainage Districts Organized 13 Maps Approved 84 Field Inspections 60 Fees Collected: Applications, Dam Plans, Leases, Deeds and Reports $ 1972.70 </seg>
            <seg id="p291">286 REPORT OF SECRETARY There are two or more projects having appropriations from a stream that have been receiving a sufficient supply, for several years, from seep streams without taking any water from the original source of the appropriation. Not having cooperation, the department can not have an accurate records of water used. Respectfully submitted, DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS R. H. Willis, Chief Bureau of Irrigation, Water Power &amp; Drainage. </seg>

            <seg id="p376">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 371 WATER POWER During the period between November 30, 1924, and November 30, 1926, fifteen water power permits have been issued by the Depart - ment, eight of which have been cancelled for the reason the appli - cants have failed to prosecute construction work as provided by law. Below is a description of each project covering permits issued during the past biennium which have not been cancelled. Application No. 1715 — Ruby Power Plant. The appropriators, Seward City Mills of Seward, proposed to construct an 18 ft. dam across the Big Blue River in Section 15 Township 10 North, Range 3 East of the 6th P. M. Detailed plans have not been filed and ac - cording to progress reports on file very little work has been done at this site. Application No. 1725-Application No. 1777 — Power development on Niobrara River. Permission to undertake a hydro-electric Power Project on the Niobrara River about 23 miles directly north of O'Neil, Nebraska, has been granted the Northern Nebraska Power Company of Spencer, Nebraska, by virtue of filings made by C. J. Hubbell of Deweese and A. W. Person of Fairmont, organizers of the Company. Application No. 1725 was approved January 29, 1925, and work was commenced in July of the same year; and later application No. 1777 was granted for an addition in height of dam. Many diffi - culties were encountered and progress was slow until the spring of 1926, when more equipment was brought on the job, and the project has moved steadily forward since that time. The development contemplates a solid masonry dam of the ogee type, trenched into shale which underlies the river at this point. The dam is 23 feet high with 375 feet of spillway. Two re-inforced concrete flumes, 30 feet wide, 16 feet high and a tainter gate 12 feet by 24 feet complete the river control. An earth dyke will be built from the south abutment of spillway to south bluff of river a distance of approximately 2800 feet. The lake created by the dam will cover an area of 1200 acres, and will back water about two miles. The power house is located in the lea of the North bluff where it will be sheltered from storms of winter. Power house sub-structures consist of two concrete flumes of two bays each, and there is pro - vided a silt pocket and gate valve in each bay just down stream from bottom end of trash rack, for eliminating any accumulation of silt at this point. </seg>
            <seg id="p377">372 REPORT OP SECRETARY To preclude interruptions resulting from ice, compressed air will be piped to bottom of all trash racks, and a steam outlet provided in each bay at level of gate house floor. An ice fender will also be installed in the forebay to guide floating ice to spillway and divert it from trash racks. Three of the eight sections of dam have been completed at this writing (November 30, 1926), and foundation for fourth section la in place. Three-fourths of the material for earth dike has been placed and power house sub-structures are complete up to the generator floor. Tainter gate and non-spill section are also finished. Aggregates for concrete have been procured from local deposits and nearly all labor has been secured in the vicinity. The equipment will consist of two propeller type water turbines set vertically and have a capacity of 1520 horse power each, at 15 ft. effective head. The propellers will have an overall diameter of 10 feet and be capable of discharging 1000 cubic feet of water per second of time. To complete the prime movers a 1300 KVA generator will be directly connected to each of the water turbines. Each unit will also have its oil pressure governor, lubricating devices and other accessories. The equipment will be housed in a re-inforced concrete and brick building made entirely fire-proof and having dimensions of 66 feet long, 42 feet wide and 60 feet high from bottom to wheel pit to The officers of the Northern Nebraska Power Company say this plant will be ready for operation by March 1st, 1927, and will cost about $400,000.00, which estimates includes only power plant and riparian lands. Power will be transmitted to towns and cities within a radius of 100 miles or more. Power in excess of 16,000,000 KWH annually will be produced by this plant. </seg>

            <seg id="p380">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 375 Application No. 1815 — Lynch Hydro Electric Power Plant. This permit was granted to the Northern Nebraska Power Company of Spencer, Nebraska. The proposed plant is located on the Niobrara River in Section 5 Township 32 North, Range 10 West of the 6th P. M. Power is to be obtained from turbine wheels, developing 1000 theoretical horse power, requiring a dam 24 feet in height. This application was recently granted and the department has very little information regarding the progress of the project. Application No. 1832 is a permit granted to W. E. Stewart of Spring Ranch, Nebraska. It is proposed to construct a dam six feet in height across the Little Blue River in Section 17 Township 5 North, Range 8 West of the 6th P. M., Clay County. Application No. 1850, permit granted to C. A. Kucera of Friend, Nebraska. This development is located on the Middle Loup River in Section 35 Township 18 North, Range 17 West of the 6th P. M., Custer County. The amount of the appropriation is 176 cubic feet of water, requiring a dam 15 feet high, developing 200 theoretical horse power. Detailed plans of the dam have not been filed and to date no work has been done on the project. Application No. 1852 — Gage County Electric Company of Beatrice, Nebraska. This permit was granted under date of September 27, 1926, and applicant has until March 27, 1927, to file detailed plans of the dam and start construction work. The plant is located on the Big Blue River in Section 13 Township 4 North, Range 5 East of the 6th P. M., Gage County, and the project when completed will cost ap - proximately $140,000.00. Power is to be obtained from turbine wheels, requiring a dam 18 feet high, developing 340 theoretical horse power. This location, known as the Hoag site, has been filed upon several times and for various reasons the project has not been developed. Application No. 1858 filed by T. H. Carter of Hebron, Nebraska, is for a permit to construct a hydro electric power plant in Section 35 Township 18 North, Range 17 West of the 6th P. M. Custer County. This application is pending before the department. Application No. 1872 filed by F. C. Krotter of Palisade, Nebraska, under date of November 19, 1926, is for a permit to construct a dam 80 feet high across the Frenchman River in Section 22 Township 5 North, Range 35 West of the 6th P. M., Hayes County. It is pro - posed to construct a canal approximately 6 miles. The project will cost $45,000.00, including fluming. The development at this site appears to be very practical and feasible. The application will be approved within a short time. </seg>

When an action in equity is appealed, it is the duty of this court to try the issues de novo and to reach an independent conclusion without reference to the findings of the district court. Comp. St. 1922, Sec. 9150. But in a case wherein the court has made a personal examination of the physical facts, and where, in the same case, the oral evidence in respect of material issues is so conflicting that it can not be reconciled, this court will consider the fact that such examination was made and that such court observed the witnesses and their manner of testifying, and must have accepted one version of the facts rather than the opposite. Greusel v. Payne, 107 Neb. 84. 2. Upon examination of the record, we find that the judgment is amply supported by the evidence. Heard before Rose, Dean, Day, Good, Thompson and Eberly, JJ DEAN, J. The Delaware-Hickman Ditch Company, of Dundy County, here - inafter called the Company and its officers were cited under section 8428, Comp. St. 1922, to appear at Bridgeport, before the Department of Public Works, there to show cause why its appropriation for a certain quantity of water for irrigation purposes from the Republican River, in Dundy County, Nebraska, should not be canceled and forfeited, on the alleged ground of non-user. Defendants own and occupy 1,280 acres of land under the ditch, and in their joint answer it is alleged, in substance, that for many years they used the water pursuant to the appropriation, in fact, ever since 1895, when the grant was obtained, and that, shortly there - after, they constructed the headgate, main ditch and laterals, and the irrigation works generally, and appropriated such water as was needed to irrigate the above mentioned lands. And they alleged that practically every year large sums of money were expended by them for the construction, upkeep and maintenance of the ditch and to keep it and the works generally in repair. It is also alleged that the soil through which the ditch runs is a light, sandy, porous loam and is therefore "subject to seepage," and much of the land under the ditch has received great benefit by reason of subirrigation, so that it did not at all times require the application of surface irrigation, unless the rainfall was deficient, and that at such times, when irriga - tion was deemed expedient and appeared to be necessary the land </seg>
            <seg id="p384">DEPARTMENT OP PUBLIC WORKS 373 was regularly irrigated through and by means of the ditch and the works generally. It is alleged, too, that, during all of the time since the appropriation of water involved herein, the headgate, main ditch, laterals, drops, spillway, and the works generally, have been kept in a reasonably efficient and operative condition and capable of furnishing the water for which the project was constructed. And L  - defendants insist that they have in no way, either by word or act, abandoned the right to use the full appropriation, and have never entertained any intention to abandon any right acquired through the appropriation. In support of defendant's material allegations there is evidence tending to prove that, during a part of the time involved in this in - quiry, there was no water available in the Republican river, so that, of course, irrigation from that source temporarily ceased; but, when needed, it was regularly turned into the ditch. A ditch foreman was employed each year, the evidence shows, and from $250 to $300 was expended yearly for ditch repairs exclusive of labor costs. It is also disclosed by defendants' witnesses that it was the expressed policy and the uniform practice of the company to extend the ditch to all points where the water might be beneficially used. George E. Johnson, then Secretary of the Department of Public Works, caused to be attached to the record certain instruments pur - porting to be verified copies of original reports made by the water commissioner which were adverse to the contention of defendants. Mr. Bailey, the commissioner, testified that he acted in that capacity while he was engaged with other work which was entirely aside from his duties as water commissioner. Other witnesses called by the de - partment of public works gave evidence which, in some particulars, flatly contradicted that of the defendants. And in respect of the evidence, plaintiff frankly makes this concession in his brief: "Many apparent conflicts appear and much indefiniteness in the use of terms occurs." Some of the evidence was taken in the form of depositions and some oral evidence was submitted in the presence of the court. And, besides, the court's findings disclose that the trial judge, accompanied by counsel for the opposing parties, made a personal examination of the irrigation works in suit throughout all its course; so that the court not only saw and heard many of the material witnesses who testified, but a personal examination of the physical facts was made as well. So much of the court findings as are immediately pertinent to the facts follows: "Proceeding to consideration of the case upon its merits, the - court finds from the evidence and the observation made at the exam- </seg>
            <seg id="p385">380 REPORT OP SECRETARY illation of the works and grounds, pursuant to the stipulation of counsel, that the contestee, Delaware-Hickman Ditch Company, has constructed and is maintaining the irrigation works in question, and that the structures and appliances used in connection therewith are of a feasible and practical nature, and. adapted to the purposes for which constructed; that the water of the Republican River has been put to the beneficial and useful purpose of irrigating lands for which the appropriation was made; the works and structures are probably as substantial as the size of the ditch would justify, particularly when consideration is given to the irregularity of the supply of water and demand for water; that at times there is no available water in the river at the point of diversion, and at times irrigation not necessary; that there has never been an abandonment of such irrigation project; and there has not been a failure to use said works, nor to apply the water appropriated thereby for irrigation purposes for a period of three consecutive years. The court finds generally in favor of the contestee and against the contestant." The rule is that, when an action in equity is appealed, it is the duty of this court to try the issues de novo and to reach an inde - pendent conclusion without reference to the findings of the district court. Comp. St. 1922, Sec. 9150. But in a case wherein the court has made a personal examination of the physical facts, and where, in the same case, the oral evidence in respect of material issues is so conflicting that it cannot be reconciled, this court will consider the fact that such examination was made and that such court observed the witnesses and their manner of testifying, and must have accepted one version of the facts rather than the opposite. Greusel v. Payne, 107 Neb. 84. Reversible error had not been pointed out. It follows that the judgment must be, and it hereby is, AFFIRMED. </seg>
