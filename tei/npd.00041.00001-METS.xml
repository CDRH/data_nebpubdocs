Section 6780 of Cobbey't Annotated Statutes: Irrigation and Water Power — Water Divisions: "Tha State of Nebraska is hereby divided into two water divisions, denominated Water Division No. 1 and Water Division No. 2, respec - tively." Section 6781 — Boundaries of Division One "Water Division No. 1 shall consist of ail the lands of the state drained by the Platte River; and also all other lands lying south of the Platte and South Platte rivers, that may be watered from other superficial or ubterranean streams not tributary to said Platte Rlvar Section 6782 — Boundaries of Division Two Water Division No. 2 shall consist of all lands that may be watered from the Loup, White, Niobrara and Elkhorn Rivers, and their tributaries and all other lands of the state not included in any other water division." Kor convenience in the adjudication of claims and in the distribution of water, these divisions have been subdivided into twelve water divisions denominated 1-A, IB, l-O, ID, IE. IF; 2-A, 2-B, 2-C. 2-D. 2-E. 2-F, as shown on the accompanying map. </seg>
            <seg id="p008">8 &gt;► REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT OF WATER DIVISION NO. 1 To The Honorable State Board of Irrigation, Highways and Drainage Gentlemen: — I am submitting herewith my report with the view of acquainting the water users of Water Division number (1) one with the work performed and conditions met by me during the last two years as Water Superintendent. During the season of 1915 gaugings were made by some of the water commissioners and some of the gaugings by the State Hydrographer and myself on the North Platte river at the State line (Henry), Bridge - port, North Platte and Elmcreek and North Platte on the South Platte river. The gaugings made by others than myself were reported to me at Bridgeport as soon as they were made. Observers were employed to read the gauge rod at these stations and reported daily by postal card to my office. Reports of the amount of water flowing in the river at Whalen, Wyo., were also received daily from the United States Reclamation Service, together with tri-weekly reports from the Path - finder Reservoir. This information was used in making a division of the water to the water users. Canal managers were requested to have their ditch riders or headgate keepers read the canal gauge rods and report the gauge height on the postal card furnished by the State, to the water superintendent daily. It is considered a great advantage to an irrigation project to supply the superintendent with prompt information relative to the status of the canal flow. Sufficient current meter measurements were made in each canal at their rating flume by the State Hydrographer that upon receipt of gauge height cards from the ditch riders, the amount of water flowing in the canal is immediately ascertained. This system, although somewhat crude, was the means by which the status of the streams was known each day during the irrigation MM, In the management or distribution of the water of the streams, only such irrigation projects having filed their acreage reports were con - sidered, primarily. The acreage reports on file were used as the basis in the distribution of water during the irrigation season. These reports contain mainly, a list of all lands which an irrigation project proposes to irrigate during the current season. Some protests have been made by a few of the larger projects against making out a list of lands, claiming that the work was too laborious with no real benefit to anyone. </seg>

Highways and Drainage, to have this list each season is considerable, especially during a time of scarcity of water. When there is an insufficient amount of water to satisfy all the appropriators. it becomes necessary to close the junior appropriators The question confronts the water superintendent: How much water should the senior appropriators have when the junior appropriators are burning up? Should the senior appropriator have the full amount of his grant or just enough to supply the lands actually being irrigated? V the latter amount, then the acreage report furnishes the data needed. The following is the delivery schedule used for the sason of 1916: WATER DELIVERY SCHEDULE. Division No. 1-A. For the season of 1916. based upon corrected acreage reports filed prior to June 1, 1916. This schedule will govern the distribution of the natural flow of the Plane. North and South Platte Rivers and tributaries during periods of scarcity, by the water commissioners.

            <seg id="p013">12 The following is the delivery schedule of Storage Water under Contracts with the United States Government. The system of procuring the data necessary to manage or distribute intelligently, the water of the streams in Water Division No. 1 was some - what improved over the season of 1915. This was due mainly to the placing of Mr. D. P. Weeks, Jr., by the State Engineer, as hydrographer on the streams of my division. His whole time was devoted to the measurement of streams and canals. This feature was very gratifying and should be continued. Mr. Weeks gauged the North Platte river from Henry to Kim Creek on the Platte river. Establishing stations at nearly every wagon bridge on the river and employed observers to read the gauge at each station and report to my office on postal cards furnished by the State, daily. By this arrangement much better service was rendered the water users. In connection with the above plan of frequent stream measurements on the river it was possible to prepare and mail a bulletin three times a week to all water commis - sioners, secretaries of irrigation projects and commercial clubs and others who were interested, during the season of 1916, covering the status of the river flow, including the outflow and inflow of the Path - finder Reservoir and the amount of water passing Whalen, Wyo., to - gether with rainfall reports whenever it was possible to get them. From July 8th to the 15th, it was necessary to close all canals whose priorities dated later than January 1, 1894. This was the only period during the seasons of 1915 and 1916 it was necessary to close any canals. I wish to make a few suggestions, which, in my opinion, will tend to make the office of Water Superintendent much more useful to the water users than it has in the past. First: — Two hydrographers are needed to make the measurements that are so desirable in the management of the distribution of the waters of this water division. The two hydrographers, I believe, will cover the entire territory from Elm Creek to Henry, measuring every week, the river flow at all suitable wagon bridges, all seep streams, tributaries to the rivers and all ditches.

Third:— Install automatic water stage recorders on the North PUtte river near the Wyoming-Nebraska line. Bridgeport. North Platte and Kim Creek or Lexington. Fourth: — Formulate a plan whereby the ditch managements will be more inclined to co-operate with the water superintendent, water com - missioners and hydrographers in keeping records of canal flows. Fifth: — Canals without rating flumes should be required to place one at nine convenient point in canal near the point of diversion. Nearly all anals now have rating flumes and good headgates.

The State Board, or its representative, shall have authority to order any changes they may see fit in said plans, and require the drainage district to conform thereto; and shall at all times, during the construction, have the right to inspect said work, and make recommendations pertaining to the same. Upon request of any interested party or parties of the proposed drainage dis - trict, the State Board may prepare for them, plans and specifications for any proposed drainage work at actual cost of doing same." Plans for Drainage Districts approved: Otoe and Johnson Counties Drainage District No. 1 Frontier County Drainage District No. 1. Merrick County Drainage District No. 1. Richardson County Drainage D. strict No. 4 Nemaha County Drainage District No. 3. Horse Shoe Lake Drainage District. Horseshoe Lake Drainage District. — This district l.es in typical sand hills of Cherry County, Nebraska. The area is approximately township 34, ranges 39 and 40. The drainage consists in cleaning out the natural water course from lake to lake for about 15 miles, involving about 17 lakes. The district was organized June 17, 1916. under the laws of Nebraska, as provided for in Article 5, Chapter 19, section 149-204, inclusive, Section 1899 of Revised Statutes of Nebraska, 1913, as amended by Article l Chapter 28, of the Session laws of 1915, of the State of Nebraska. The purpose of the drainage is to ( reclaim hay land. About 3,540 acres are expected to be drained at an estimated cost of $10.00 per acr ■ This land will yield two to two and one-half tons of wild hay to the acre valued at $2.00 per ton uncut. Experience under similar conditions shows that this land may, the third year after drainage, be made to grow three tons of red clover and timothy per acre, and in exceptionally favorable years, two cuttings may be made. The proposed work involves about 150.000 cubic yards of excavation in sand and muck at an estimated cost of 18 cents per cubic yard; 17 timber bridges of 14 to 16 foot spans, at an estimated cost of $160.00 each; engineering work including preliminaries and all work previously done, about $3,000.00. Contract for the excavation was let at 17V4 cents to Fred M. Crane Co., of Omaha, Nebraska. August 15, 1916. Work com - mences October 1, 1916, to be completed January 1, 1918. All the work will be paid for by cash paid into the district treasury by the Individual land owners with the exception of perhaps $5,000.00, for </seg>

Burt and Washington Counties.— The largest drainage district that has been constructed in the State is in Burt and Washington CounMes. This work, when completed, will cost approximately $450,000.00. One of the principal features of this district is the twenty settling basins, which are designed to remove the silt, drift and debris from the flood waters before allowing them to enter the drainage ditchas. These basins are of considerable interest, and they have already proved to be a great benefit in protecting the drainage ditches, and in building up the low land where they are located. </seg>
            <seg id="p017">16 IRRIGATION There was very little water UBed tor irrigation during t h - year l»lf&gt;. owing to the excessive rain fall; however, this condition was reveraai in 1916, and all of the land under ditches used a considerable amount ol water. There was enough water for all of the ditches at all times, excepting seven days in July. IRRIGATION LEGISLATION. The first law relative to irrigation was p»8S3d by the Legislature ot the State in 1877. This law enabled corporations formed to const ruri and operate canals for irrigation and other put poses to acquire rights ol way; and declared such works internal improvements. tThe Saint Raynor law. the first general irrigation law. was passed 1889. It provided for the appropriation of running waters for useful or beneficial purposes by posting a notice at the point of diversion, a copy of the notice to be filed with the county e'erk of the county in which the diversion was located, and construction to be begun within (10 days and prosecuted diligently and uninterruptedly &lt;o completion. The law provided that irrigation works should be exempt from taxation; that the same land should not be covered by more than one ditch or lateral with - out the owner's consent; that irrigation works were internal improve - ments; that water from one stream should not be turned into anotht r stream; that rights of way could be condemned for irrigation purposes: that excessive amounts of water should not be used; and that the waters appropriated should be distributed in certain ways. I'nder this law there was no way of knowing the value of a right except by going into court, and a right was always open to attack. The people of the western portion of the State wished to have sonii' state control over wat?r rights, and in 1891. an irrigation convention was held at Lincoln, and drafted a bill. This hill was introduced in the Legislature that winter but was defeated. Another bill almost identical with the first was introduced in the Legislature in 1893, but was defeated after a spirited fight, and the friends of irrigation had to be contented with an amendment to the Saint Raynor law allowing water rights to ba - ffled on streams 20 feet or over in width, and permitting water, under certain conditions, to be turned from one stream into another. The members of the Legislature from ( lie eastern nortion of the state fear a that the passage of an irrigation code would be looked upon as an adver - tisement to the outside world that the rainfall in the state was not Mitt' e'ent to produce crops, and that this would have a tendency to check Et. The complete failure of all crops because of the drought in sed ths question of adopting an irrigation code to be made ;i issue that fall. The Legislature in 1895 passed an irrigation </seg>

The irrigation rode created a state board of irrigation, consisting of the governor, the attorney general and the commissioner of public lands, the governor being ex-oflicio president of the board, and divided the state into two water districts. The law provided that at the first meeting of the state board it should elect a secretary, who should be a hydraulic engineer of theoreti - i al knowledge and practical skill and experience, and an under secretary for each of the water divisions, and that it could employ an assistant ecn'tary and such other assistants as might be necessary. The board. itlier directly or through its secretary or under secretaries, was charged with the measurement of all streams in the state; the determination of priorities and amounts of all claims initiated prior to the passage of th3 law. and the issuance of certificates of appropriation for claims found valid, the distribution of all waters appropriated; the receiving, record- ing and considering of all future applications for permits to appropriate water; th? granting of permits, if there was any unappropriated water in the streams, and the appropriation asked for would not in any other way be detrimental to the public welfare; and the issuance of cer - tificates of appropriation when satisfied that the applications had been rfected according to law. lis law, besides granting the board certain police powers and fix - unities, denned standards of measurement; dedicated the water state to public use; fixed the date of priority of applications and iler of preference in using water for different purposes; granted ■ right of eminent domain for irrigation works; exempted irrigation rks from taxation ; and provided for mutual irrigation companies. 1895 to 1911 a number of minor changes were made in the irriga - te, most of which were for the purpose of assisting tne state board in its administrative work. At the sessions of the legislature in 1911 and 1913, practically the entire code was revised and re-enacted, with amendments. Among some of the more important changes made were the following The "State Hoard of Irrigation" was changed to the "State Board of Irrigation, Highways and Drainage:" the board wag charged with the duty of examining into the condition of all water appropriations and of holding hearings and cancelling rights where the water had not been used for beneficial purposes for more than three years; the maximum amount of water that a tract could receive was limited to :; acre-feet per acre per year; irrigation works were declared common &gt; arriers and the rates for water were to be determined by the state rail - way commission: and the list of all lands to be irrigated were required tn be filed with the superintendent of each water division April 1 of </seg>

The main provisions at present are as follows: A majority of the electors, who also own or hold by leasehold a majority of the lands in the district susceptible of irrigation from a common system of works, may petition the County Commissioners of the County in which the land, or the greater portion of it lies, asking that an irrigation district be created including all the land. A copy of the plans, etc., submitted to the county commissioners must be filed with the state engineer, who must examine them and submit a report to the board of county commissioners at the meeting set for the hearing of the petition. If the petition, either in its original form or in the amended form, is approved by the board of county commissioners, the board divides the proposed district into three divisions, and calls an election to vote upon the organization of an irrigation district, and to elect a director for each division, if the vote is favorable to organi - zation. If upon canvassing the vote the county commissioners find a majority favorable to organization, the district is declared organized, and the directors elected meet and organize. The board of directors has control of the affairs of the district in a general way and is au - thorized to make surveys, acquire rights of way. and to secure lands, water or other property by purchase or condemnation. All surveys. maps, plans and estimates must be made under the direction of a com - petent engineer and sent to the state engineer, who shall file a report upon them with the board of directors. Having determined the amount of money required, the board of directors calls a special election to vote on the question of issuing bonds, and it a majority of the votes are in favor of issuing bonds, a special proceeding is begun in the district court to have the bonds examined, approved and confirmed If the bonds are confirmed they are sent, together with a history of the district, to the auditor of public accounts for registration if he finds the law has been conformed with in all respects. When registered, the bonds may be sold at 95 per cent of their face value, or if not sold, can be used to pay for property or for construction at their par value. The bonds and interest are paid from the revenues derived from an annual assessment upon the real estate in the district. They bear interest at 6 per cent, and unless otherwise provided by a majority vote at the time of issuance, a certain per cent is payable each year, beginning with the expiration of the eleventh year. This per cent cannot be less than 5 at the end of the eleventh year. After the eleventh year the minimum increases 1 per cent a year through the eighteenth year, and is 15 per cent in the nineteenth year. All the bonds must be paid upon the expiration of the twentieth year. The secretary of the board of directors certifies to the county clerk the amount of money needed each year for the payment of interest, bonds and for operation and maintenance, and the taxes are collected by the county treasurer at the same time that other county taxes are collected. </seg>

The state is divided two districts, each in charge of a water superintendent, and each ct is divided into divisions in charge of water commissioners, who t to the superintendent. » Information concerning water rights can be obtained by inspecting records of the state board and by consulting the state engineer. The gation laws have been published in pamphlet form, and copies ma; obtained by addressing the state engineer. IRRIGATION ENTERPRISES t There is no Carey Act project within the state, and with the excep - of the Interstate Canal, built and operated by the U. S. Reclamation ice, all the canals in the state are operated under the following nizations : 1. Individual or partnership ownership. 12. Mutual Irrigation companies. These are corporations or associa s organized under the laws of the state for irrigation purposes, and ving no revenue from the operation of such works. t:l. Stock companies. These are corporations, and in some cases stock is owned entirely by non-landowners; in others, chiefly by residents, of which only a few own land under the canal; and in r cases, by only a part of the landowners under the canal. 4. Irrigation districts. Along small streams where only a small amount of water can be diverted nearly all the canals fall under the first class. On the larger streams, canals operated under each of the different types of organization are to be found. Bach type of organisa - tion has been attended with success and with failures. The results in each case usually can be traced to the circumstances and conditions en - countered, and the methods employed in surmounting them. I Owing to the great number of enterprises that have been under ;en, it is not practicable to undertake to describe them all.

The Company sold some water rights but the enterprise was not a financial success as the lower eight miles of the canal were hard to maintain and the delivery of water to the lands under the end of the canal was very uncertain. On November 1, 1905, a petition signed by twenty landowners was presented to the board of county commissioners of Lincoln county. praying for the organization of an irrigation district to include the land under the upper twelve miles of the canal. On December 26, 1:&lt;I&gt;5, the commissioners approved the petition and called an election to be held January 27, 1906. On February 5, the commissioners met as a canvass - ing board, and finding 15 votes "yes" and one "no," declared the district duly organized. Bonds in the sum of $18,000 were then voted and paid to the company, who cancelled all water rights under the lower end of the canal. The land within the district, for district purposes, is assessed on a valuation of $10 per acre. Total area in district-1916-5147.63 acres, the greater part of which was irrigated to some extent this season. The crops watered being corn. oats, wheat, alfalfa, orchards, potatoes and other garden truck, and wild hay. The financial condition of the district is good: assessed valuation being $51,476.30, bonded indebtedness $19,400.00. A levy of tweniv mills on the dollar valuation was made this year to pay off bonds, 1 5th of which becomes due in 1917. Also a levy of twenty-two mills to pay interest on bonds. The canal is in good shape, carries ample water for all consumers; considerable work in concrete was done on the head - gate this season. CANALS ALONG THE FRENCHMAN RIVER Champion Water Power and Irrigation Ditch (0-47). This ditch was formerly seven miles long and was constructed in 1891. with $4,500 donated by Champion precinct of Chase County. The ditch was found to have too small a capacity, and was enlarged by an individual at a cost of $3000. Later it was sold and the Ditch extended three miles. Kilpatrick Brothers Company of Beatrice are the present owners of the ditch, and with the exception of water used on one quarter section of land, outside their own holdings, the water from this ditch is used entirely on their own land. In addition to the ditch, Kilpatrick Bros, have constructed in con - nection with their irrigation system, a reservoir which covers approxi - mately 120 acres. About 4000 acres are susceptible to irrigation, under this ditch, and about 2000 acres are irrigated from year to year, the water being used for irrigating wheat, oats, barley, emmer, alfalfa, corn and potatoes. The ditch and reservoir cost approximately $25000. </seg>

The Company owns seven miles of main - ditch, only, the laterals being owned by the individual members; two and one-half miles of the ditch were built as a private ditch in 18*6, and four and one-half miles in 189t&gt;. The amount of land irrigated each year for the past seventeen years is 450 acres. The total cost of opera - tion is $200.00 per year, on the average. Crops raised consist principally of alfalfa and forage crops, with some grain and vegetables. tMaranvilte Ditch (D70-71). This ditch is 4V4 miles long and was in 1895, at a cost of $5000 by three partners. The canal heads it 9 or 10 miles west of Champion. The financial condition of the Maranville Ditch Co. is first class, does not have any indebtedness whatever. They value the plant at $6000. The yearly cost of operation is not to exceed $100.00 in keeping up ditches and dam. This ditch irrigates about 500 acres, when they get all the water they need; the principal crops raised being alfalfa, some oats and spelts, and garden, but mostly alfalfa. Frenchman Valley Irrigation District (D24, 25 29 and 30). The canal formerly known as the Culbertson Water Power and Irrigation Cal has been owned and operated by the Frenchman Valley Irrigation rict since March, 1913. The waters of the Frenchman River are diverted into the canal by an earth dam located about one and one-half miles northwest of Pal - isade. The river Hows through the canal half a mile and then intersects the channel of the Stinking Water Creek. The next half mile the canal is partly in the enlarged channel of the creek and the remainder in an excavated channel. At the point where the canal leaves the bed of the Stinking Water Creek, the difference in grade between the river bed and the bottom of the canal is about five feet. At this point the head - gates or controlling works are located. They constitute a reinforced concrete structure with a thirty-two foot opening for the river channel. During the irrigation season, vertical posts, equipped with trips for the purpose of instantaneous waste of flood water down the river, are set across this opening and flash-boards are dropped in between them to a height of about eight feet, thus diverting the water into the remainder of the canal. This location of the controlling works provides a settling basin the width of the river channel and tapering from five feet deep at the flash-boards to the original grade of the river one mile up the canal. The sediment is scoured back into the river during the winter and enough never accumulates during the irrigation season to cause trouble. </seg>
            <seg id="p025">22 The main canal is twenty-six miles long and at the end the water is diverted into three main distributing laterals with a combined length of almost eleven miles. The water delivered to seventy-five per cent of the lands must be carried about twenty miles along the side of the river valley where the cross drainage is very heavy and at times causes damage, both in wash-outs and the deposit of sediment. t Since acquiring possession of the canal, the District has improved y the construction of two riveted steel and reinforced concrete in - ed siphons, reinforced concrete headgates and controlling works. one open steel flume, ninety-one concrete and tile water gates for farmers' turn-outs, seventeen public bridges, four reinforced concrete spillways for flood protection and also regulation of the canal, twenty concrete drops and checks, and strengthened the embankments at re - quired places for the entire length of the canal. Provision was made in the bond issue voted at the time of the formation of the District lor the bulk of the improvements: but the public bridges, about seventy-five per cent of the farmers' water gates, the spillways, and about twenty five per cent of the grading for strengthening the embankments have been done under the regular maintenance and operation tax levy. The bonded indebtedness of the District is $15t&gt;.&lt;&gt;o&lt;i.«ii&gt; or approxi mately $15.00 per acre. The taxes have been paid up or sold each year as levied. At present the registered warrants are selling readily at par The levy on the assessed valuation of the year 191B is ninety mills for the general fund and seventy mills for interest on bonds. The levy ... ninety mills covers the cost of operation for the season of 191«. and also a deficit occasioned by the excessive damages caused by the torrent ia rains of 1915. which were not completely covered by the levy of tlia year. tThe District organization includes 9.368 acres, approximately ninety per cent of which is irrigated at some time during each season most important crops grown are small grain, sugar beets, alfalfa and potatoes. Riverside Canal (D-18). — The farmers under this canal attempted to form a company — the Riverside Canal and Irrigation Company, but the organization was never perfected, and they have operated the canal under a mutual agreement whereby each acre constitutes a share. Six and one-half miles of canal were built in 1894. and an extension of one mile in 1897, the entire cost of construction being $3,000.00. The canal was built somewhat upon the plans followed in the construction of the ('uJbertson canal. The entire flow of the river is diverted by a dam about three miles east of Beverly, and conducted throu&amp;u a new channel for about three-fourths of a mile at which point, the headgates and waste gates are located. The excess water is here wasted back into the old rnnel of the river. This canal covers 1,200 acres lying in the valley which 694 acres are irrigated. All operation charges are assessed </seg>

The Kimball irrigation District was organized by local parties who filed an appropriation for a storage project April 15. 1908. On July 22, 1909, a petition signed by twenty - four landowners was presented to the board of County Commissioners of Kimball County, praying for the organization of an irrigation dis - trict, and on October 9. the board approved the petition and called an election for November 6. On November 15, the commissioners met as a canvassing board, and finding an unanimous vote in favor of the district, declared it duly organized. On April 9, 1910, bonds in the sum of $250.000. 0«l were voted for the construction of the project. These were issued under date of July 1, 1911. They were sold during 1911, the purchasers being mostly local men. The project is comprised of two storage reservoirs. The lower one located seven miles west of Kimball has been formed by building an earthen dam, 4900 feet long. with a maximum height of 45 feet, across the bed of the creek. The dam contains 221.000 cubic yards of material, the capacity is 7200 acre feet, but the plan has been to partially refill the reservoir each season, and so increase the supply to 9000 acre feet. To prevent wave action, the dam has been protected with reinforced concrete face laid in section. The water is diverted from the reservoir through one outlet on the north side of the creek. About one-half mile below the dam the canal branches and the south canal crosses the stream in a steel flume This branch is twenty miles Ion?, while the north branch is fourteen miles long. The system covers 7200 acres of irrigable land, and during the season of 1914 over 80 per cent of the land was actually irrigated. In the construction of the system, fourteen steel flumes were used. These cost $35,500 in place The largest flume is 1100 feet long and has a maximum height of 5fi feet. The second reservoir is located seven miles farther up the stream. </seg>

Cost of maintenance for 1914 — 60c per acre; for 1915 — 60c per acre, and for 1916 — 75c per acre. Part of this year's maintenance went into construction of new steel flume, therefore this cost has not increased. Each annual levy for interest on bonds is $2.25 per acre making the total levy for 1S16 — $3.00 per acre. Ninety-five per cent of all the lands in the district are in culti - vation and in crops th s year, and all this land is irrigated. The crops consist of sugar beels, potatoes, cabbage, alfalfa, native hay. wheat, oa's, barley, spelts and corn. This season has been very dry water delivery best since organiza - tion; it is contemplated all lands will be in cultivation in year 1917. First run water for year 1916 from May 11 to July 31. Two additional deliveries were made to finish potatoes and beets. CANALS ALONG THE NORTH PLATTE RIVER Castle Rock Irrigation District (D-921). The Castle Rock Irrigation and Water Power Company was incorporated with a capital stock of )20,000 in April, 1889, and during that month a notice of appropriation was posted on the south bank of the river in Section 4. township H north, range 54 west. Construction was started the same summer and continued until the summer of mt&gt;, by which time 17 miles of main canal and three miles of low-line lateral had been completed at a cost of about $20,000. ■ On May 3, 1898, a petition signed by nine landowners was presented the county commissioners of Scottsbluff County, praying for the or - ganization of an irrigation district, and on May 5, the commissioners approved the petition and called an election to be held on June 4. On June 13, the commissioners met as a canvassing board and finding 19 votes "yes," and 18 votes "no" declared the district duly organized. The district did not obtain possession of the canal until 1912. On September 14, 1912, a bond election was held at which bonds in the sum of $30,000 were voted. These bonds were issued under date of October 1, 1912, and $20,500 worth were used to purchase the canal from the old company. $6,801.96 to -retire water rights of the old canal and repair and build lateral headgates, and $2,698.04 to pay for the construction of a head - gate. The only indebtedness of the district is the bonded indebtedness of $30,000, the district meeting payment on all warrants regularly. The cost of operating canal is about $4&lt;Hm.

This proposition was accepted at this meeting, but on February 9, 1889, the decision was reconsidered and the organization of the Enterprise Ditch Company was decided upon. Stock was subscribed for and the Company organized on March 7, 1889, as a mutual stock company, with an authorized capital stock of 500 shares, with a par value of $100 each. Surveys were made and a notice of appropriation posted on the north bank of the river in Section 28. township 23 north, range 57 west, pr.or to the latter part of March, 1889, a copy of the notice being filed with the County Clerk of Scottsbluff County, on March 30. Construction on the ditch was started at once, but as the projected ditch was quite long, and there were not many stockholders, it was not completed until 1895, by which time the ditch had been built for a distance of 24 miles at a cost of $31,306.00. Water was first diverted from the river and used along the upper portion of the canal during the latter part of the season of 18Hi&gt;. On May 2, 1XH8, twelve of the landowners under the canal presented a petition to the county commissioners of Scotts Bluff County praying tthe formation of an irrigation district and on May 23, the commis - ers approved the petition and called an election to be held June 18.

The bonds were issued under date of October 5. 1898. and the transfer to the district was made March 17. 1900. On August 7. 1910, a second issue of bonds was voted in the sum of $15,000 for the construction of a permanent beadgate. These bonds were issued under date of September 1, 1910. Of the first issue of bonds, $22,800.00 have been paid to date. All bonds which are due are paid except one bond for $150.00 which has not been presented for payment.

The Karmers Irrigation District, or TriState Project as it is called, is second in size and im - portance in the state, and by far the largest enterprise constructed by private capital. On August 31, 1887, some settlers, who formerly had lived in the irrigated sections of Colorado, organized the Farmers' Cunal Company, and on September 16 posted notices of appropriation on the north bank of the river in Section 10, township 2S north, range 5X west : coptai &lt;&gt;t the notices were filed in the office of the county clerk of Cheyenne County, which at that time included the territory now in Scotts Bluft County. This was the first instrument making claim tor irrigation pur - poses to be filed within the State. Construction was begun in 1888 and continued until UM. at which time the canal had been completed for a distance of in miles, at a cost of about $7,800. The work was done by the stockholders. ea&lt; h being assigned a certain stretch of work which was estima ed to represent tin - amount of the stock suhscr.bed by him. In 1891. these farmers, tindiiiu that they were not financially able to complete the work, sold tlu&gt; canal, reserving perpetual water rights to themselves, to a company which was promoting a much larger project, and wished to use the line of the canal as its right of way. This succeeding company authorized a bond issue of $25u,0O0 and proceeded to enlarge and extend the canal by opening up detached stretches through a distance of 25 miles. It was forced to cease con - struction in 1893 on account of the inability to float more bonds. The actual cost of construction undertaken amounted to about $86,000, which together with the accrued interest, brought the total to approximately $100,000. Not being able to meet the accrued interest or the bonds fall - ing due, foreclosure proceedings were brought in 1898, and the canal sold by an order of the court in 1901.

The Tri-State Land Company, with an authorized capital stock of 160.000 shares of the par value of $100 each, was organized in 1904 and purchased the rights of the Farmers Canal Company. In 1905, they began to enlarge and extend the canal. To supplement the appropria - tion from the river this company in 1912 purchased at a cost of $500,000 a perpetual right to 180.000 acre-feet of stored water annually from the 1'athfinder Reservoir.

At this election, additional bonds in the sum of $153,000 were voted to be used in making some improvements and meeting the accrued interest at the end of the first year. These bonds were issued under date of January 1, 1913. The present outstanding bonded indebtedness of the farmers Irriga - tion District amounts to $2,203,000.00 — $500,000.00 of the bonds of the district having been cancelled and cremated by the terms of a certain contract between the District, The United States and the Tri-State Land Company, through which contract the District saved $25,000 in cash which had been paid to the United States by the Tri-State Land Com - pany, and 6' , interest on $500,000.00 of its bonds amounting to $30,000.00 per year or $600,000.00 during the 20 years in which the bonds were to run. in exchange for which the District assumed an indebtedness to the I'nited States of $475,000.00 payable in installments as follows: Without interest. $9,500.00 on September 1. 1915, $9,500.00 each July 15, 1916, 1917, 1918: $19,500.00 each July 15, 1919 and 1920: $28,500.00 each July 15. 1921 to 1934.

For the purpose of providing funds with which to pay maintenance and operation expenses and to provide interest on outstanding bonds the lands within the District are assessed each year, against which assess - ment a certain mill levy per dollar of assessed valuation is made. In the year 1915 a levy of 40 mills on the dollar was made for maintenance and operation and 50 mills on the dollar to provide interest on bonds. l&gt;ands were assessed at $40.00 and $50.00 per acre, therefore the lands which were assessed at $40.00 per acre were obliged to pay $1.60 per acre for maintenance and operation and $2.00 per acre for bond interest making a total tax per acre of $3.60.

These two enterprises are so closely re - lated that it will be best to consider them together. In July. 1893. Reuben Lisco posted a notice of appropriation for 32.86 second feet of water on the north bank of the river in Section 14, township 18 north, range 47 west, and built the Lisco canal, which was five miles long, for the pur - pose of irrigating his own lands.

This Company proposed to irrigate a stretch of territory east of that watered from the Lisco ditch and desired to use the same right of way. A contract was entered into whereby the company enlarged the Lisco canal, and in return agreed to carry free of charge the water to which Lisco was entitled. The company was composed entirely of farmers, who worked out the stock subscribed for upon the following basis: The entire yard- age to be removed was estimated, from which the number of yards to be moved for each 40-acre tract was determined; The farmers built 33 miles of canal, in addition to enlarging the five miles of the Lisco ditch during the years 1896-1898. According to the yardage estimates made, it would have cost $33,000 to build the canal by contract. The Lisco canal formerly covered 1500 acres, and the completed canal brought an additional 12,000 acres under the ditch. Water was used by the farmers in this larger area for several years, then dissen - sions over the use of the water arose and the ditch was allowed to de - teriorate. It was not used after 1900, when a large break occurred in the Sand draw that was never repaired. When the company failed to keep the canal in repair, in accordance with the contract, Lisco was forced to keep the upper end in running order to supply water to his lands. He immediately brought an action, and obtained a decree giving him his water right and the five miles of the canal on his former right of way. He then attached the canal of the company for the costs of </seg>

In 1910 Lisco made an application for three second-feet additional, in order to cover mil the lands below the canal. He then listed his own lands for sale, attaching u water right to each tract sold. A mutual stock company with a capital stock of $20,000 has been organized and has taken over the management of the canal. There are about 2800 acres under the ditch, and during the season 1916 about jmki acres were under irrigation. The maintenance and operation arses have been very low, being only 25c per acre. Midland Canal (D-789) and Overland Canal (D-791). These two anal* were built during 1894 and 1895 by individuals. Bach cost about 12,000. The Midland has a length of about 4V4 miles, and the Overland a length of 5 miles. The Overland heads below the Midland, but being built on a lighter grade it crosses over the Midland two miles below the headgates of that canal. Since 1905, the portion of the ditch lying below the Midland canal has been practically abandoned, the water being brought from the river through the upper portion of the Midland Canal. This practically combines the two ditches. The Midland (anal is owned by C. E. Roberts, and is free from all indebtedness. About 320 acres are under irrigation, crops being mostly alfalfa and corn. The Overland Canal is owned by the Western Land &amp; Cattle Com - pany, has under irrigation about 1040 acres of alfalfa, corn and native hay, in addition to small garden patches and some fruit; is free from all indebtedness, and during the past year the operation and up-keep of this canal was about $300.00. The Suburban Irrigation District (D-662). A notice of appropriation was posted on the south bank of the river in Section 12, township 14 north, range 33 west, on May 22, 1894, and on May 24, 1894, the Fanners and Merchants Irrigation and Land Company was organised with a capital stock of $50,000. On July 20. 1894, the articles of incorporation were amended, changing the capital stock to $25,000. This company pro - posed to build a canal to cover all the lands lying in the delta around and below the town of North Platte, and during the years 1894 and 1895, 18 miles of canal were built at a cost of $25,000. On January 28. 1896, a petition was filed with the county commis - sioners of Lincoln County, praying for the organization of an irrigation district, and on March 16. the commissioners approved the petition, and called an election for April 10. On April 20, the commissioners met as I canvassing board, and finding ten votes "yes" and one "no," declared the district duly organized. The district voted bonds in the sum of $26,000 for the purchase of the canal. The area of the district is about S500 acres, and practically all of the same has been irrigated more or during the existence of the district. </seg>
            <seg id="p034">30 The last of tbe $26,000.00 bonded indebtedness was paid in July of 1816, and tbe district is now entirely free of indebtedness, and has paid all of the costs of maintenance for the past three years upon a cash basis. The assessment for 1915 amounted to a total of $1.00 per acre, being 36c per acre for maintenance. 4c per acre for interest on bonds, and 60c per acre to pay the balance or the principal of the bonds. For this year, that is 1916, the only levy is 40c per acre for maintenance. For twenty years of the existence of the district, the average tax has been 55c per acre, and the highest being the $1.00 per acre in 1915 when the last of the bonded indebtedness was paid, and the lowest 15c. The Board of Directors have replaced several old wooden drops and checks with reinforced concrete, and have also erected two large con - crete and steel flumes, and two concrete and steel bridges. It is ex - pected that the tax of 40c an acre will be sufficient for maintenance and to replace all wooden structures in the near future The principal crops raised are alfalfa, wild hay. small grain, corn and beets. Winters Creek Canal (D-952). The Winters Creek Irrigation Com - pany was incorporated October 1, 1888, with a capital stock of $10,001). represented by 100 shares of the par value of $100 each. Sixteen per - sons subscribed for 80 shares, each share representing 40 acres of land. Surveys of the canal were completed during November, 1888, and con - struction was undertaken the same month. No contract was let tor the construction, each shareholder being allowed to work out 90 per cent of the par value of the stock subscribed: the other 10 per cent was paid in cash. During the winter the number of stockholders increased to thirty, and by May 1, 1889. about ten miles of the canal had been built. Water was diverted and was run the enMre length of the canal that sea - son. In the winter of 1889-1890. the authorized capital stock was In - creased to $10,700 by issuing seven more shares. The canal was en - larged and extended to its present length of 12 miles. On January 1, 1911, the Company was re-incorporated with a capital stock of $96,000, represented by 960 shares of the par value of $100 each. A large portion of this stock is now held by the Imperial Land Company, a subsidiary of the Scotts Bluff Sugar Company. The Company acts merely as a common carrier, and makes an annual charge of $3.00 per acre upon all contracts executed prior to May 15th, of each year and $4.00 per acre upon all contracts executed after the 15th of May, for the service of delivering the water to the headgate of the lateral. The laterals were built almost entirely by the farmers. The headgates are located in Section 17. township 22 north, range 55 west, on a bend in the north bank of the river, and during the past, drifting sand has entered the headgates and settled in the upper por - tions of the canal interfering greatly with the operation. There are 5840 acres of irrigable land lying below the canal and dur </seg>

CANALS ALONG PUMPKIN SEED CREEK. Meredith and Ammer Ditch (D876). The Meredith and Ammer Ditch was built in 1893. The system consists of two ditches, one on either side of the creek, diverting water at the same dam. The ditch on the west side is two miles long, and the one on the east side is 2 l * miles long. At present the ditch is owned by a co-partnership, consisting of four equal interests. There is no bond mortgage or other indebtedness against the ditch. The cost of maintenance is nominal, probably not to exceed one Hundred dollars. l"p to date a concrete dam has been constructed at a cost of about four thousand dollars. About 900 acres are under irrigation. Crops irrigated are wheat, oats. corn, spelts, potatoes and alfalfa, also a considerable acreage irri - gated for wild hay. Mutual Ditch (D843). The Mutual Ditch Company was incorporated with a capital stock of $10,000. each share representing a water right to forty acres, and having a par value of $100. Four miles of ditch were built during 1891 at a cost of $2,140.00. New headgates were built in 1912 at a cost of $250.00. One hundred and sixty acres were irrigated in 1914. and about 200 acres in Ittl5 and 1916. The assessments are made for the current year's expenses on the number of shares held: the expense of operation and maintenance is about 30c per acre. Crops irrigated are mostly alfalfa and wild hay. CANALS ALONG THE REPUBLICAN RIVER Cundy County Ditch (D118). The Dundy County Irrigation Company was organized in 1890, and 21 shares, with a par value of $500, were sub - scribed by the water users, each share representing the right to one sec - ond-foot of water. However at the present time, all the old users of water have dropped out with the exception of VVm. Hickley — five shares, and L. Morse — ten shares. The Company posted a notice of appropriation on November 22, 1890, at a point on the north bank of the stream in Section 24, township 1 north, range 39 west. Construction was begun immedi - ately and during 1891 eleven miles of canal were built, the work being done almost entirely by the stockholders. The cost of the canal was $4500 of which $1500 was spent in the construction of headgates and three flumes. The Company extended the canal 2hi. miles In 1894 at a cost of $700. During the first five years of operation the cost of main - tenance almost equalled the first cost of the canal, and the two lower flumes were allowed to become dilapidated. At the present time only </seg>

On ar count of the shifting sands of the river bed the Company does not al tempt to maintain a dam across the river, but when the flow becomes low they construct a temporary dam of brush and straw. The acreage cosi o! maintenance is about $300 per year. The Meeker Canal (D-4-7-8-9), now operating as The Mclook Hitch Company, heads on the south bank of the Republican River in Section 15, township 3 N, Range 31 West, 4V4 miles east of Culbertson. Nebraska. Nineteen miles or this canal were built during the years 1891-1892. Two precincts of Red Willow county voted and issued $10,000 in bonds to aid in the construction. The balance of the money for construction was raised by the builders on personal notes. In 1893, the McOook Irrigation and Water Power Company was or - ganized with a capital stock of $50,000 and took over the canal. The Company then extended the canal 3% miles, hut this portion was later abandoned, on account of the excessive cost of maintenance. The com - pany purchased the Carson ditches, Nos. 1 and 2. holding prior rights and abandoned them, transferring the water rights to the Meeker Canal. The cost of construction of the system was $50,000. Water rights for 160 acres were formerly sold for $2,000. In. Um price has been advanced to $35 an acre. Up to the season of 1915, there was an additional maintenance charge of $1.00 per acre. This amount, however, was found to be inadequate to meet the operating expenses of the Canal, and this maintenance charge was raised to $2.00 per acre in 1915 by the State Railway Commissioners. There are paid-up water rights for 2400 acres under the canal; water is also leased to non-holders of water rights, the rental price being $3.50 per acre. There are lo.ooo acres lying below this Canal. 3,950 acres were irrigated in 1911, 4200 acres in 1912, and 2561 acres during the season 1914. This Canal was not operated extensively during the season of 1915, due to excessive rainfall, which eliminated any direct need of water for irrigation purposes. This exces - sive rainfall caused considerable damage at various points along the canal in the way of washouts and flooding dirt into the channel. In November, 1915, a petition for Receivership was tiled, and on No - vember 20, 1915, the McCook Irrigation and Water Power Company passed into Receiver's hands. At the Receiver's sale, held in March. 1916, the McCook Irrigation and Water Power Company was purchased by Mr. \V. H. Ferguson of Lincoln Nebraska, and has since been operated under the name of McCook Ditch Company. Beginning in April, 1916, extensive repairs and improvements have been made at various points along the Canal, mostly in the line of Spill - ways, widening and cleaning and increasing the carrying capacity of the Canal. These extensive repairs incurred a cost of $10,000 to the present operators. Under ordinary conditions the maintenance charge of $2.00 per acre should be sufficient to meet the operating expenses for the season. Corn. </seg>

This ditch was constructed by the Rupert Ditch Company in 1912-1913. All the stock is owned by some of the land - owners under the ditch. The ditch is nine miles long, and has three siphon flumes, all of concrete. The ditch has been damaged considerable by the floods of 1915, and since then they have had plenty of rain so the ditch has not been used. CANALS ALONG THE SOUTH PLATTE RIVER. Miller and Warren Ditch iD-805). A notice of appropriation was posted January 5, 1895, and construction of ditch begun. In all about six and one-half miles of canal have been built at a cost of about $4500. A mutual company, called the "Miller and Kimball Canal Co.," was organized in 1903, and now own and control the canal. There are about 3760 acres under the canal, each share of stock covers a water right for forty acres; forty-five shares of stock have been issued. No indebted - ness. The ditch is maintained by stockholders, and no assessments made for repairs as yet. The affairs of the Company are conducted by three directors, elected annually by the stockholders. Prairie hay and alfalfa are the principal crops raised. CANALS ALONG WHITE TAIL CREEK. Keystone Canal (A-662B, 843, 1003)— West Keystone Canal (A1001) — Foster Keystone Canal (D730). The Keystone Irrigation Company was incorporated in 1909 with a capital stock of $100,000.00, all of the stock - holders being owners of land under the Company's ditches. The Cor - poration has no bonded or other indebtedness. The organization in - cludes practically all of the old canals and water rights in the North Platte Valley in the vicinity of Keystone, including the irrigation interest of the W. A. Paxton estate. Five thousand acres of land are covered by the different ditches of the company and the water is used extensively. The water supply comes from White tail and other creeks which keep up their flow during all kinds of seasons. The cost of maintenance has been only nominal so far, being only 10 to 15c per acre per year. The crops irrigated are alfalfa and wild hay, to furnish feed for the large herds of cattle; also sugar beets, corn and other general farm crops. </seg>

This law was very brief and merely gave to companies desiring to construct such work the right of eminent domain and declared them to be works of internal improve - ment No mention whatever was made of any course of procedure whereby title or the right of property to be use of water could be acquired.* The next legislation covering the use of water was passed by the Legislature of 1889. This act provided the right to acquire the use by appropriation of running water flowing in any river or stream or down any canyon or ravine; provided that the same be ased for bene - ficial or useful purposes, and that when any appropriate* or successor in interest ceased to use the water so appropriated for such a purpose the right ceased; that no land was to be burdened by more than one ditch, without the consent of the owner thereof; that all ditches were ex - empt from taxation; that the point of diversion might be changed if others were not injured; that the water so diverted must be returned to the stream from which it was taken; that as between appropriators the one first in time was first in right; that a notice be posted by the party desiring to appropriate water at the point of intended diversion, stating the point of diversion, the amount of appropriation, the purpose for which claimed, the place of intended use, and the means by which it was intended to divert; that a copy of the notice be recorded in the office of the County Clerk of the County in which the notice was posted; that excavation must commerce within sixty days from the time of posting notice and continue to completion; that completion meant con - ducting the water to the place of intended use; that a permanent right was granted to the use of all water beneficially used through ditches which had previously been completed; that owners of lands bordering on streams were entitled to use of water on adjoining lands; that the right was given for condemnation for right of way; sites for reservoirs, and to enlarge ditches; that ditch companies were au - thorised to borrow money and issue bonds; that canals constructed for irrigating or water power purposes were declared works of internal improvement; that ditches must be kept in proper repair; and pro - vided a penalty for interfering with ditches of gates. t The next law governing the use of water was enacted by the Leg - islature of 1895, which passed the first comprehensive law regarding and relating to the use of water for irrigation and water power pur - poses.

I The State Board of Irrigation organized itself on April 24, ISM. g composed of the Governor, as President of the Board, the Attor- General and the Commissioner of Public Lands and Buildings. State Board appointed its secretary, state engineer and other itants, and at once prepared claim blanks which were sent to water 8 of record in the offices of the different county clerks, which were i out and returned to the office of the State Board. Hearings were on those claims and the rights of the different claimants adjudi - d. For convenience in keeping a record of these claims, the ings were numbered in order in which they were held, and were id "Dockets." Thus all claims for the right to the use of water r to April, 1896, are known as "Dockets." Special attention is sd to this for the reason that it is necessary to know the docket ber of a particular water right in order to look it up. After a hearing on one of these claims which were presided over by the Secretary, an Opinion was rendered by the State Board upon the evidence submitted, which determined the amount of water, the use to which it was applied, the point of diversion, the location of the project, and the date of priority. These Opinions are bound in book form in the office of the State Board and are final and binding except where appealed from to the District Court. t For all water rights since April, 1895, the Board upon its organiza- Eat once prepared blanks, known as "Application Blanks*' which ■ supplied to persons desiring to obtain a permit for the uae of waters of the State of Nebraska. These were filed on the date and ' received at the office of the Board, given a numerical number and recorded.

The date ot priority to the right to use water under all applications, dates from the filing of the appli - cation in the office of the State Board, which is considered the date of priority. These applications are taken up, investigated by the Sec - retary and acted upon by the Board through the Secretary and either approved or dismissed. Under the law as it exists at present, an applicant feeling himself aggrieved by the action taken by the State Board on his application lor a permit to appropriate water, may ask for a hearing before the State Board at which hearing, testimony may be submitted for an 1 against any proposed appropriation, the * State Board having the right to summon any witnesses and in all things act as a court rendering a final decision in the matter, from which decision an applicant may appeal directly to the Supreme Court of the State, the same as in cases before the State Railway Commission. Cases pertaining to irrigation and water coming before the Supreme Court are advanced on the docket, so as to receive prompt consideration. tUpon the allowance of an application, the applicant shall begin actual work of excavation and construction within six months from the date of approval of said application. The application being in fact, simply a permit to the right of the water and no perfected rights are supposed to have been acquired until the project has been completed and the water beneficially used and applied The work of construction of a power plant must be vigorously, diligently and uninterruptedly pro - secuted to completion and one-tenth of the total work must be completed within one year from the date of approval. Also the applicant must die by the tenth of each month a report under oath to the State Board, giving the actual amount of money expended on such power development during the preceding calendar month. »The time for completing the appropriation and applying the water beneficial use is left to the discretion of the State Board, and in moat cases a year is allowed after the completion of the construction work tor the application of water to beneficial use. When the time for applying the water to beneficial use has expired the applicant is re - quired to file a proof of appropriation on a blank furnished by the state. This proof of appropriation shows how much water has been applied to beneficial use and the purpose, and is made under oath and attested to by Witnesses. Upon receipt of this the Secretary of the Board makes a personal investigation and verifies the proof. If everything is found to be according to law the certificate is issued, which certificate grants the applicant the right to the use of the water which has been applied to the beneficial purpose and th" right to the use of the same for as long as the applicant shall apply the same to said beneficial use. </seg>

Creighton Water Power Development (Application 914). This de - velopment is located on Bazile Creek, and is used to operate mill and electric light plant; develops approximately 60 horse power. Ravenna Mill Development (D-1037) Beaver Creek. This develop - ment was first constructed in 1891, and has been in continuous use with the exception of two or three short periods, when a portion of the dam was washed out. The present dam is constructed of cribs with con - crete abutment at each end. Holmesville Power Plant (D-1021). On the Big Blue River. Has an appropriation of 500 second feet. Power is used exclusively for hydro - electric purposes, current being furnished to the towns of Beatrice, Wrmore, Blue Springs, and Holmesville. The plant is constructed en - tirely of concrete, and was finished in December, 1911, being operated continuously ever since. Fourteen feet head is provided for, capable of developing 675 horse power. Average output of the plant for the last five years has been one million K. W. H. per year, but during the past year it will run as high as one million three hundred thousand, which is about the capacity of the plant. On this account another plant is being contemplated at Barnston to take care of the increase in busi - ness. Staplehurst Power Development (A-1135). This power plant is located on the Big Blue River at Staplehurst; power is obtained from 30 inch Leffel Turbine. Dam is 8 feet high. The power is used daily for light and power. Ericson Lake Development (A-1415). The development of the Ericson Lake Co., on the Cedar River about one and one-half miles below the village of Ericson, Neb., consists of an earth dam with concrete spill - way and flume for the installation of two 150 horse power units. The flow of the river is normally about 250 second feet.

The current is very swift and is fed all along the stream by numerous springs which furnish the purest water in the United States, testing 99' ; pure. This stream runs into a canyon. In 1885 a wooden dam was built which furnished power for a burr mill. This was remodeled to the roller system in 1888, also in 1900. In 1909 the Long Pine Light &amp; Power plant was installed by S. H. Kyner. In order to have more power a concrete dam was constructed, giving the plant a 20 foot head. There is a 54 inch tube 75 feet long which conveys the water from the pond to a steel penstock, where a 26 inch Sampson water wheel is installed which furnishes the power for the dynamo located in the concrete building, with the switch board and other electrical appliances, water wheel and governor, etc. The plant is giving continuous service Owing to increasing business, it is contemplated installing another unit and a 30 inch Sampson wheel of the horizontal type. Hydro-Electric Development at Jtoelus, under application 1373 — Central Power Co. The hydro-electric development consists of a diver - sion dam across the Middle Loup River, a canal three miles in length with a generating station at the lower end discharging into the South Loup River. The resultant head at the power house is 30 feet which with the minimum flow of the Middle Loup River makes possible the development of 2500 K. V. A. The dam is a concrete structure built on piling. It is 50 feet in height from bottom of concrete foundation to top of concrete crest. It is set 8 feet below normal river level and therefore raises the normal level 2 feet on the upper side of the dam. On the top of the concrete portion is three feet of flash board. The normal river level is therefore raised 5 feet by the dam when the flash boards are in place. The piling under the dam are steel sheeting 40 feet long mak - ing a complete cut-off wall under the crest. I'nder the apron are round piling 40 feet long spaced 10 feet center to center and a further cut-off wall 10 feet from the down stream edge of 30 feet wakefleld piling. The dam is 523 feet long over all and out of this is a sluiceway on the south end of 62 feet consisting of four openings. Two of these have steel gates with hand operated racks and the two nearest the spillway are fitted with stop logs. The spillway extends 43 fee: with the river and is protected from underwash by the steel sheeting. On the north end of the dam is an earth nil 3000 feet long protected for 700 feet by steel sheet piling driven in line with that under the concrete portion. This fill is 20 feet wide on top with 3 to 1 slopes on the up stream side and 2 to 1 on the down stream side. It is paved with rip-rap where the wash strikes it on the up-stream side. On the south end and at right angles to the spillway are the head - gates which are controlled by stop logs. There are 5 gates, each open - ing being 11 feet wide by 9 feet high and protected by trash racks which also are arranged that they art as ice guards. Over the head- </seg>

The water on leaving the headgates passes into the canal which !■ 30 feet wide on the bottom with 2% to 1 slopes for the first half mile and 2 to 1 slopes from there on. The canal carries 10 feet of water and has a fall of 3 feet in the three miles of length. For some 10,000 feet is necessary to build dikes in order to provide sufficient margin for the required depth, the minimum cut being 5 feet while on the other hand the deepest cut is approximately 22 feet. The material thru which the canal passes is, for the first half mile a fine sand, for the rest of the length it is almost entirely yellow clay. The total yardage is about 400,000 cubic yards. At the lower end the canal widens into a small forebay about 50ti feet wide by 1.000 feet long. The power house which is built largely of re-inforced concrete is in two distinct parts. The part nearest the South Lonp Kiver which houses the generators and electrfl-al equipment, is 46 feet wide facing the river, and SO feet deep towards the canal. The discharge flumes from the wheels pass under this portion. These flumes being 20 feet wide each and some 20 feet deep, about 13 feet being below river level; a re-inforced coiicrete floor covers these flumes and above this are con - crete beams £nd columns carrying a concrete roof. The sidewalks are of brick S inches thick, and steel factors su&gt;l The wall nearest the canal is solid concrete 3 feet thick and forms bulkhead to hold back the water in the wheel pits. The shafts of th turbines pass through this wall to the generators which are dire, coupled. The other portion of the building which, as has been indicated, is on the canal side, consists of two flumes or wheel pits each 20 feet wide, 50 feet long, and varying in depth from 18 to 25 feet. In each flume is mounted a turbine of the horizontal type, and the discharge from the turbine is carried through the floor into a draft tube which is 10 feet in diameter, where it leaves the wheels and curving at right angles discharges horizontally into the discharge flumes under the gen - erator portion of the power house through openings 20 feet wide and 11 feet high. The walls of the wheel pits, which are of re-inforced con - crete are two feet thick at the base and batter to 9 inches at the top. Across the flumes is a concrete bridge capable of carrying a 20 ton roller, and the trash racks and stop logs for the flumes are on the canal side of this bridge. Water from the canal is received through a flume whic'.i is 60 feet wide and 16 feet deep on the canal side, with battered sides and bottom to join the wheel flumes. The length of this auxiliary por - tion is 20 feet, making the total length of the powerhouse 100 feet. The wheels as previously stated are horizontal, 42 inches in diam - eter and are mounted two on a shaft. Each wheel is capable of d&lt; veloping 1,500 horse power when passing 630 cubic feet of water per </seg>

A. for the plant. Bach unit carries its own exciter direct connected and besides there is a 60 K. \V moter driven exciter sufficient to excite both generators. The wheels are controlled by oil pressure governors of 15,000 feet pounds capacity. In the generator room is also placed three 750 K. V. A. 2,300 to 33,000 volt water cooled transformers. These stop the power from generator voltage to high line voltage. All connections between gen - erators, switchboard and transformers are lead covered cables carried in the floor in 3% inch Orangeburg Conduit. Some of these cables are so large it was found necessary to run two sets in order to get a size that ( ould be easily handled. The 33,000 volt lines are carried out of the building through roof bushings. From the bushings they pass through choke coils and airbreak switches to the line; the coils, switch and electrolitic arrester being mounted on the roof. The switchboard consists of seven panels among which are (be - sides the ordinary generator panels) the high line control panel, and I control panel for the auxiliary plant which will be built on the South Loup River below the main power house, and the small feeder panels. Where the auxiliary plant is to be located a 10 foot fall is available by making an 800 foot cut through a bend in the river and a IM K V. A. unit will be installed to take advantage of this. It will he floated on the line without a governor or a special attendant. Makinc the cut mentioned will take the South Loup about a half mile from the power house and will relieve it of all difficulties due to flood waters In the tail race and this is the principal reason for making this part of the development. The outgoing lines from the station are the 33,000 volt line to the steam plant at Grand Island; the 2,300 volt line to the auxiliary plant. a 2.300 volt line to Boelus and also to the 6.600 volt outside substation which is located just east of the building. This consists of three M K. V. A. 2.300 to 6,600 volt transformers and from this sub-station to the 6.600 volt transmission line goes east to Dannebrog and St. Paul. The hydro-plant is of such capacity as to be admirably suited to the territory it is to serve, being centrally located in a growing coun - try and the waterpower should soon be loaded to full capacity for a considerable portion of the time, the peaks being carried by the steam plant.

I call your attention to the tabulations at ivtngM taf iirs and 1915-1916. These averages are tabulated from the annual report c of the counties on twenty ton bridges. There have been a few fifteen bridges constructed in the past year. The average cost of the fifteen bridges is approximately 15 per centum less than the cost of the tw ton bridges. You will note that the price has been reduced, notwithsl ing the fact that material has increased considerably during tin - two years.

HIGHWAYS AMI DRAINAGE r i pi ■t NEBRASKA HYDROGRAPHIC REPORT, 1916 I'lif work in hydrographic investigations during 1915 was confined a general study of the flow of Nebraska streams at scattered gaging iiions throughout the state, these stations having been maintained rough a number of years for the purpose of water power determina - nt, and id some extent, in the western portion of the state for irriga- purp&lt; 1916 an attempt was made to continue the stations maintained past throughout the state, and to carry on. also, a special investi- ion of the flow in the North Platte river between the Wyoming state ■ and Kearney, and to determine as tar as possible the amount of di - sion and incrassation occurring between these points. he amount of funds available, however, proved insufficient for carry- g mi both the general investigations as in the past and the special in - stigations on the North Platte river, which seems at this time to be very portant both from the standpoint of pending litigation with adjoining ites and also from the standpoint of the water superintendent appor - &gt;ning water among the various users in the valley. The general work s abandoned therefore on May first, and a concentrated effort was made make the greatest use of the funds available for hydrographic work era Henry and Kearney aging stations discontinued on May first over the state in general follows: Itig Blue at Beatrice. Republican at Bostwick, Platte at Fremont, Loup at Columbus, Little Blue at Fairbury, Birdwood Creek at Suther - land. Plafte at Kim Creek, Platte at Columbus, Elkhorn at Arlington. Qagtag stations established at this time in connection with the North te river investigations are as follows: North Platte river at Henry. Morrill, Mitchell, Scott's Bluff, Min - utare, Bayard. Bridgeport. Broadwater. Lisoo, Oshkosh, Lewellen, Keystone, Sutherland, and North Platte. uth Platte river at North Platte. Platte river at Gothenburg, Lexington and Elm Creek After establishing these stations the following were found to be lm - acticable because of poor conditions at the station: North Platte river at Morrill. Scott's Bluff. Bayard, Lewellen, and Sutherland. Gaging stations with their estimate of daily discharge herewith pre - nted are: North Platte rticer at Henry. Mitchell, Minatare. Bridgeport, Rroadwater, Lisco, Oshkosh, Keystone, and North Platte. Platte river at Gothenburg. Lexington, and Elm Creek. </seg>
            <seg id="p247">214 KK.IMkl IK STATE KM.INKKM The following nui&gt; be said regarding future work that may be done along this line: More frequent gagings are necessary at each station to obtain the best results. More than a mere comparative value of discharge can be expected and with proper care, equipment, and organization, a very close estimate can be made of the actual flow of the river at each of the gaging sta - tions which were maintained throughout the entire season. The following problems are to be met which do not occur in such extremes in ordinary hydrographic work: The river at most of the stations is very broad and very shallow at the times when most careful observations are needed, thereby making actual measurements very difficult. The shifting sand of the river bed affects greatly the relation of gagf height to discharge. Hack water from a number of the irrigation lieadworks produ condition unfavorable to accurate results. Wind blowing from one side of the river toward the other will pro duce a gage height different than would be exhibited with the same flow on a calm day. The low salary which has been available for observers has made it impossible to get the most reliable service in the matter of reading gage heights. By reference to the accompanying chart showing hydrographs for each of the gaging stations at which estimates of daily discharge were made. it may be readily seen that certain inconsistencies present themselves in comparing one hydrograph with another, but the hydrographs here pre - sented represent the discharge as computed for that particular station independent of any reference to the other gaging stations. Keeping this in mind it is fair to assume that these inconsistencies might well lie re - duced to a minimum by a more intensive survey of the station. In addition to river measurements it was attempted to obtain as nearly as possible an estimate of all water flowing into the river between the points under consideration as well as an estimate of the diversions. An attempt was made to have each water user make daily observation of gage height in his rating flume and submit a record of these gage heights to the State Engineer. Casings were made in the rating flume and referred to the gage height read by the water user. Many difficulties presented themselves in this respect. Many of the rating flumes were in poor shape and conditions for reading were very bad. Several of the water users were indifferent in their co-operation with the office of the State Engineer in spite of the fact of the law re - quiring them to furnish gage heights and efforts of the Board of Irriga- </seg>

However, on the larger enterprises where the value of water and of co-operative work with the state were apparent, more evidence of better co-operation was experienced. Many promises were obtained for reading gage heights that were not fulfilled, but the data that has been supplied will be of considerable value and is contained herewith. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE INVESTIGATIONS. An automatic gage should be installed on North Platte, at Bridgeport, and one either at Mitchell or Henry. Two hydrographers with small cars can cover the territory from Henry to Kearney in a very efficient manner, reducing the results of the investigation from one of comparative value to one of absolute value. The headquarters of one hydrographer might be North Platte, while other could headquarter at Bridgeport or Scott's Bluff. Due consideration should be given to blank forms, observers' Meld books, observers' report cards, and other forms upon which the data is to finally be recorded. Observers should be paid a higher salary than was prevalent in the past, and insistence made upon their diligent and accurate work. A report of each observer should be made to the office of the State Kngineer, and to the water superintendent of Division No. 1, from the principal gaging stations daily and from the less important stations each week. It should be the duty of some person in the office to keep these re - ports platted up to date both for the detection of poor work on the part of the observers and for the purpose of giving information of stream flow at any time it may be needed. Actual measurements should be platted in the office as soon as com - puted, each hydrographer computing his own notes and sending in a re - port of same to the general office and to the water superintendent or Di - vision No. 1 Water users should be instructed to get their rating flumes in good order before the irrigation season. Legislation is urged to compel water users to co-operate more thor - oughly in furnishing gage heights to the State Board. Each station should be carefully referred to permanent bench marks for future reference. For the purpose of future comparison stations should be maintained from the first of April to the thirtieth of September. This means that the hydrographers should be in their respective territories by at least the fifteenth of March. If the ice has not left the river at that time the or- </seg>

SEEPAGE RETURN IN THE NORTH PLATTE VALLEY The complications which beset us in estimating the seepage return of the North Platte river are many, and a series of observations extend - ing over a period of more than one season would be necessary to even approximate a satisfactory idea of the amount of water returning to the river from the different irrigation projects. Among the difficulties encountered may be mentioned problems i &gt;t obtaining accurate estimates of diversions, inaccuracies entering into river discharge measurements and estimates, and greatest of all the constant change in proportion between surface flow and underflow. Our investigations were organized last spring primarily to make a general study of the flow of the river between Henry and Kim (reek and to obtain as accurately as possible, an estimate of all diversions from the flow of the river. No special return flow investigations were made, but it was hoped that an analysis of the data collected would be a means of a fair determination of this return flow The only way in which it is possible to get a figure on the amount of diversion is by conscientious co-operation on the part of t lit- water users Some of the water users during the past season were very good about this. Others were good in their promises only, and a few were antag - onistic toward any plan of co-operation, whatever The accuracy of stream gagings in connection with an hUbh seepage return bears much more importance than a mere estimate • amount of water available for use. Under ordinary conditions of measurement the I'laite and North I Matte river present very aggravating problems Where the water is spread out over nearh a half a mile of width with a depth of small frac - tions of a foot little hope of obtaining a measurement within Mr , may be entertained. However, by selecting more favorable sites and adout ing special methods and precautions, error may be reduced to a minimum. Whatever the accuracy of measurements and estimates may lie. great inconsistencies will present themselves because of the indefinite propor - tion which is maintained between surface and under How. The North Platte and Platte rivers may be considered as a general movement of water down the valley, part in the form of surface flow and a large por - tion in the form of under flow. Though this under flow is very slow, yet the large area through which it moves makes possible a large total flow. It is reasonable to believe that wherever the cross section area of the porous sub-strata is reduced by reason of a shallower depth of sand or encroachment of the bench or bluffs upon the river, more of the total </seg>

            <seg id="p251">217 i Kkll ATION, HIGHWAYS AND DRAIN ACE flow will be in the form of surface runoff. It is predicted that a more or less definite relation may be found to exist between the losses or gains from one gaging station to another and the product of the depth of the sand multiplied by the width of the valley. Information as to depth of sand may be obtained from soundings made for State Bridges. Differences in topography of the country through which the river flows hinders the use of comparative methods over the different portions of the stream. The accretions of the river through Scottsbluff and Mor - rill counties will consist of principally of seepage return. Between Bridgeport and North i'latte large quantities of rainfall have been stored in the sand hills to the north and will form a source of considerable ac - cretion Helow North Hatte a still different condition exists which will present further problems. As to results of the past seasons work in estimating return fir rif gm total acre feet passing each gaging station during the month of July us been tabulated together with estimated diversions in acre feet. The month of July is taken because in that month the stream in its upper stretches at no time varied beyond the limits of our measurements of discharge, nor was the flow as great at* any time as to introduce other complications For instance, a flow of 1,000 second feet with a possible error of 5'J would introduce a possible error in estimating loss or gain in the flow of the river of 50 second feet, while a flow of 4,000 second feet with the same possible error would introduce a possible error of 200 second feet in the loss or gain between gaging stations. It has been taken into account that ditches dating later than Jan - ary 1, 1894. were closed to natural flow from July 9th to 17th. Seepage in any form whether entering the river in streams or by underflow was left out of the table. By tabulating discharge in acre feet at one gaging station together with accretions and discharge of the river at the next station down the river together with intervening di - versions, the difference will indicate unaccountable losses or gains in the flow, which as set forth above will consist of losses in the form of evapora - tion or the disappearance of surface waters into the sub-strata, or gains consisting of seepage return from irrigation projects, accretion from springs, or the return of underflow to the surface. The results shown by this tabular representation are consistent with the theory that the river changes back and forth from surface flow to underflow, and vice versa. The principal gains are between Mitchell and Minatare. and Bridgeport and Usc-o. In each of these river stretches the bluffs come in close to the river. The other stretches show losses of varying magnitudes consistent in each case with the topographic and geologic features. With the foregoing in mind and noticing the tabular record of loss and gain in the river from the accompanying sheet, the following conclu - sions may be made. </seg>
            <seg id="p252">218 KKI1IKI uh SI \VL ENGINEE* 1st. Field work in connection with seepage return investigations must be reduced to precision, for an error of 10'; in any one Raging station might introduce an error of 100 r ; in seepage return results. 2d. A study of underflow and ground water will necessarily accom panv a study of seepage return. 3d. A series of winter measurements would be valuable in connec - tion with this study as during that time no diversions are made and evaporation is a minimum, while seepage return, though affected by temperature, would stand out more plainly. </seg>

Two wooden staffs, one nailed to a square pile about 15 feet up - stream from the north end of the highway bridge across the north channel. The other is nailed to a square pile about the same dis - tance upstream from the south end of the bridge across the south channel. Bench Marks. No bench mark data is at hand concerning these gages. However, they have been referred to bench marks and information concerning their location and datum will be on file in the office of the State Engineer. Observer. F. Erwin Powell, Morrill, Nebr. Salary'. *5-00 per month. General. Because of the collapsible dam of the Enterprise Irrigation Ditch the relation between gage height and discharge has been found to be so inconsistent that no records of data discharge are herewith published. NORTH PLATTE RIVER AT SCOTT'S BLUFF, NEBR., 1918. Location. At the highway bridge between Scottsbluff and Gering. Gage. Enameled staff nailed to a pile about 15 feet upstream from the north end of the bridge. Bench Marks. No bench mark data is at hand concerning these gates. However, they have been referred to bench marks and information concerning their location and datum will be on file in the office of the State Engineer. Observer. Mrs. ('. A. Uljenstolpe. Salary. $5.00 per month. General. Because of the extreme width of the river at this point in com - parison to the depth a very small variation in height gives a large variation in discharge. This, together with the shifting conditions of the sandy bed. has rendered it impossible to compute daily discharge. </seg>
            <seg id="p285">248 KWUKT Of STATE ENGINEER NORTH PLATTE RIVER AT MINATARE, NEBR.. 1916 Location. On highway bridge^between Melbeta and Minatare. Gage. Enameled staff nailed to wooden abutment on upstream side of bridge at south end. Bench Mark. No bench mark data is at hand concerning this gage. How - ever, it has been referred to bench marks and information concerning its location and datum will be on tile in the office of the State En - gineer. Observer. (\ Harry Uarnall, Melbeta, Nebr. Salary, $5.00 per month General. The conditions at this station are very good, considering the conditions at the other stations as a whole. However, there is some tendency towards shifting sand preventing the best results. NORTH PLATTE RIVER AT BAYARD, NEBR.. 1916 Location. At State Aid Bridge about two miles south of Bayard Gage. Enameled staff nailed to a pile on the upstream side of the old highway bridge about a half mile upstream from the State Aid Bridge. Bench Marks. No bench mark data is at lrand concerning this gage. However, it has been referred to bench marks and information con - cerning its location and datum will be on file in the office of the State Engineer. General. It is difficult to obtain satisfactory discharge measurements at this station especially during higher stages because of the swirling water about the piers of the bridge. No measurements have been made since May, 1916, except of gage height and no estimates of daily discharge have been made. </seg>

Wooden staff nailed to the downstream pile of the fir: south of the first turn-out from the north end of the bridge Observer. Harold Bent?.. Oshkosh, Nebr. Salary, $5.00 per mon General. The river is wide at this point and a small variation in gag( height indicates a large variation of discharge. This with shiftiiu conditions make it somewhat difficult to get accurate results. How ever, estimates have been made for 1918. </seg>

At highway bridge about three-quarters of a mile southwest of Keystone. Gage. Knameled staff nailed to the downstream pile of the south abut ment. Observer. Eugene Keltz, Keystone, Nebr. Salary, $5.00 per month General. The river is very wide at this point and very shallow. During a large part of the summer construction work in repairing the bridge prevented the measurement of actual discharge. However, esti - mates have been made for 1916. These are shown to be somewhat inaccurate in the drawing of hydrographs in comparison with other stations. </seg>

A wooden staff nailed to a square pile about 40 feet upstream from the south end of the bridge. Bench Mark. No bench mark data is at hand concerning this gage. How - ever, it is believed that it has been referred to the original datum used in maintaining the same station when a chain gage was used. Information regarding this datum will be on file in the office of the State Engineer. Observer. ('. Q. Waldo, mail carrier. Salary, 15.00 per month General. The information from this station is quite reliable between the stages of 2.81 and 3.36. Below and above these stages the curve has been produced to get an approximation as to the flow from daily gage heights. Shifting conditions of the bed of the stream have made it necessary to compute the discharge by a special method for shifting channels. </seg>

The principal object of the hydrographic studies on the l.uup river is for power development. It is evident therefore that some knowledge of the flow during the frozen season is desirable to fill the gap in the records from November ::utli to about the middle of March. No studies of winter flow have been made by this office previous to the past winter. Engineers in private practice have at different times made investigations of more or less thoroughness as to the probable winter run-off. Open season measurements have been made on the l.oup river I Columbus since 1XM5. Since that year there have been four seasons du ing which there were not enough ; to compute estimate! of daily flow. ing this report showing the mean the sixteen years of data available. agings made to make it practicablt There is a hydrograph accompany flow for five-da&gt; periods ba The unstable character of tin- bed and banks of the Itt Nebraska has made estimates of flow very difficult, and relia when frequent gagings have been made. The Loup river is an example of this type of stream as ma&gt; be seen by platting gagt and discharge. It is therefore to bt tions resulting from the freezing of t further trouble in obtaining accurati expected that additional comp e river in the winter will give record t Besides the varying relation of shifting sand, the direction of flow gage heights la cliscliari: ivilh respect to the gagin is continually changing. It has been the practice in making open sea son measurements to determine the angle which the stream makes with the gaging section and to take as the actual discharge that component at right angles to the section. When the stream is covered by ice these varying angles cannot be seen, thus giving additional sources of error. In late fall and in the spring after the ice has broken up great quan - titles of frazil ice have been most troublesome in making meter meas - urements. At these times frequent gagings are most desirable because the stage and bed of the river are undergoing pronounced changes When low temperatures have finally given the river a covering of ice, it is usually imperfect, a channel of varying widths usually being left where the swiftest water flows. This makes it impossible to select the most de - sirable section. Other features such as alternate layers of ice. sand and flowing water: bridge piers, brush, etc., obstructing the channel; and the personal discomfort of the hydrographer during bad weather, all affect to a greater or less extent the accuracy of winter measurements. These are given as local conditions for the station under consideration. Different streams in various localities and conditions are affected by other controlling factors. </seg>

FIELD WORK. The general procedure on the I.oup River during the winter of 1914-15 is as follows: On November 28th, before any frazil ice had appeared in the river, a special test was made in an effort to discover some means of measure - ment which would not be influenced by the flowing ice. Two parallel lines were established, one above and the other below the Union Pacific Railroad bridge, at a distance of fifty-live feet apart. On the east bank these lines were determined by crosses chiseled into the stone abutment of the bridge and on the west bank by stakes driven into the sand. Two transits were used in the tests, one on each line. Weighted floats were made with varying draught for use in water of different depths. The floats were calibrated in the Hydraulic Laboratory at the Uni - versity of Nebraska. The depth of flotation was marked on each float. The measurement was made with one man on the bridge to throw the floats upstream while another with a stop watch recorded the time re - quired for them to pass the two transit lines. A cross section of the stream was made ftrst, which made it possible to select floats which would just clear the bed of the stream. When one would chance to drag on the sand the test was repeated. Difficulty was found at first in lo - cating the float with the transit, but it was found that by making the observation from the sand bar on the west side of the river which is much lower than the abutment, where the first set-up was made, the field of view was larger and the difficulty was thus avoided. A meter measurement was made immediately before this test and was corrected for the angle of the current with the bridge, but was slightly larger than the result of the float measurement. It is evi - dent that the velocity obtained by the floats is the desired component without correction for angle. The result of the tests are as follows: Meter measurement. 2,459 second feet Float measurement, 2,390 second feet. Difference, 2.8 per cent. The period of frazil ice was of shorter duration in the winter of 1914 - 1915, than usual, and it was necessary to make only one measurement between the time the river was clear and when it was covered with solid ice. This measurement was made on December 12th, being the lowest actual discharge measurement on record, for this station. The discharge on this day was 1.012 second feet with a gage height of 2.5. Two days later the observer reported a gage height of 1.5. </seg>
            <seg id="p317">276 Oil December 23rd, the ice had formed to an average thickness &lt;&gt;l .8 feet with the exception of an open channel of about Iwenty-tive feet. In order to meter the open channel the section was selected directly under the bridge. The river had started to freeze when at the low stage noted and when it rose again due to increased flow and '&lt;&gt; back water, alternate layers of ice and flowing water resulted which for two consecutive gag - ings caused some trouble in making measurements. An ice chisel made from a buggy axle was used in cutting the holes in the ice and as the surface ice was cut through it was possible to cut the submerged layers which were not more than two or three feet below the surface. This submerged ice extended from twenty to fifty feet from the banks -&gt;n&lt;l piers of the bridge and was from two to four inches in thickness. I Across the main channel holes were cut every ten feet up to within feet of the open water. On the west side where the depth and city are small, intervals of fifteen and twenty feet were used. It considered that although this increased the per cent of error for section, the gaging as a whole was little affected. In metering the i channel, the cable and weight were used from the bridge. Rods ? used for the most part on the ice. Observations were made at hs recommended by Mr. Hoyt in water supply paper No. :i:i". A few ical velocity curves revealed the same conditions whicli open sea - curves have shown, that is that in certain parts of the channel the larity of flow is greatly disturbed and a smooth curve is impossible e in other parts of the stream very good curves are obtainable, ire the submerged layers of ice were encountered velocity readings • made, treating each layer of water as a separate section. After January 2nd, most of the submerged ice had been melted by the flowing water, which is always above 32 degrees in temperature During the early part of the winter the form of notes kept was that recommended by Mr. Hoyt, making observations of the thickness of ice. distance from water surface to bottom of ice, and total depth, and from these the effective depth and depth of observation were computed. It was considered later that inasmuch as care, speed and the personal comfort of the hydrographer are important factors governing accuracy of stream measurements, that many of these items were unnecessary and that the effective depth could be obtained in one operation. To do this two eight foot rods made up in standard two foot sections were pro - vided, one with an ordinary sounding shoe and the other with a right angle bolted to one end. As the rods were graduated to feet and tenths, effective depths were indicated immediately by the difference in eleva - tion of the tops of the rods when the sounding shoe was on the bed of the river, and the right angle was against the lower surface of the Ice. After depths were taken the sounding shoe was replaced by the meter and depths of observations were male by placing the top of the meter rod the desired distance below the top of the rod equipped with the right angle. Both rods were then grasped and held firmly </seg>
            <seg id="p318">277 Ml\kll F IRRIGATION, together and the right angle brought tightly against the bottom of the ice on I lie upstream edge of the bole. The hydrographer placed bis loot on the ice chisel which had previously been thrown across the hole parallel to the current and in this way held the rods in place. This method, it is believed, reduced the possibility of error, both in computa - tion and in manipulating the instruments besides making one operation take the place of three. An added advantage is found in the fact read - ings are taken from the rod above the point where the water has con - gealed after several wettings, which makes readings at tbe waters sur - face very difficult. Average thickness of ice was usually recorded in case it might be desired for future reference. The open channel at the bridge slowly narrowed down to about ve feet and then, following a warm spell, broke open to nearly eighty feet. Soon after, however, the channel about three hundred feet above the bridge had been completely frozen and the section was changed to this point where it could be extended across the stream at right angles to the flow unobstructed by bridge piers. During the latter part of the winter t he ice was blasted away from the bridge by railroad employees and measurements were made as during the open season. While the section was maintained at the bridge, correction was made for the angle which the flow in the open channel made with the bridge. This probably was not the direction which extended throughout the width but it is safe to assume that the variation was not great and that the importance of exactness in this coefficient in the point of great - est discharge justified the above procedure. It is recommended that an instrument be devised for obtaining the direction of flow at the point each observation under the ice. RESULTS. The results of the test are shown graphically by tha accompanying set of diagrams. The method of computation is a combination of the graphic system used to some extent by the United States Geological Sur - vey and Stout's method of computation, of the flow of rivers with shift - ing, sandy beds. In fact the use of the latter alone has been considered somewhat more satisfactory since changes of relationship between gage height and discharge have evidently taken place as gradually since the winter regimen was established as during the open season. Plotted dally gage heights show nearly as smooth a curve for the winter months as during the months of October and November, when the river was free from ice. Even during the transition from the period of frazil Ice to the solid, there seems to have been a consistent though rapid daily increase in gage heights. In seeking an explanation for the above, it might be well to consider that the station has a gravity section, that ia, the heights on the gage represent the head assumed by the water in </seg>
            <seg id="p319">278 maintaining its velocity against friction along the whole course ot the river, in contradistinction to the control section where the How over a shoal or natural or artificial obstruction determines the gage height. It seems reasonable to suppose that a temporary obstruction due to i&lt; ■&lt;■ at this point of control would produce a much greater effect than such an obstruction at any point along the Loup at Columbus. Owing to the freezing of the shallow water clear to the sand the winter channel of the stream was confined to a width of about three hundred feet, tending to reduce the shifting which ordinarily takes place across a width of six hundred feet. The effect of the submerged ice during the latter part of December is clearly shown on the gage height cor - rection curve and as it left the channel slowly the effect was gradual. Conditions do not seem favorable to the existence of anchor ice which forms on the bottom o! many streams causing sudden fluctuation in gage A rating curve was constructed based on measurements made in 1SM« and for the sake of convenience in making a rating table was built up from a scale ot second differences. A correction curve was drawn through points with distances of plotted gagings from this curve as ordinates and time as abscissa. The general behavior of the curve be tween these points was determined by a study of the critical points on a curve of actual daily gage heights plotted with time as abseil curve of daily mean temperatures served principally to aid the judgment in the above operation, and also made an interesting comparison witli the discharge curve. Corrected gage heights were found by subtracting the ordinate of the correction c urve from the ordinate of the gage height curve for the same date. It was then only a simple step to the i^imputa- in tion of the discharge from a rating table. No attempt was made to compute the daily discharge between December 11th and December 14th, as the gage heights fell below a point for which measurements have been made. The possible discharge for this period is shown on the hydrograph of a dotted line. A hydrograph based on all previous open season measurements giving a mean discharge for five day periods is also given for comparison </seg>

The original location of this station was a little over two hun - dred feet above the Union Pacific Railroad Bridge which is about a mile west of town. Measurements were made from a car and cable at this place. In 1904 the cable station was abandoned and measure - ments were made at the highway bridge, which is a little more thai a mile below the railroad bridge, until the fall of 1913. Conditions for measuring the How here, which have never been the best, were made still worse by certain improvements on the south bank and th-re - upou the station was moved to the railroad bridge where gainings are made at present from the lower chord of the bridge. Passing trains in no way interfere with the work. Drainage Area. 13.54U square miles. Gage. The original gage was a staff spiked to a pile at the (able sta - tion. When the station was moved to the highway bridge a standard u eight and chain was installed, set to read the same height as the tirst, luit this relation was not permanent. The gage used at pres - ent is a staff nailed to a pile near the original staff gage but with an entirely different datum. Bench Marks. No. 1. Standard U. S. G. S., bench mark, seventy-two feet east of the east bank of the river and a little more than two hun - dred feet north from the Union Pacific tracks. Klevation, 13.27 feet above zero of the original gage: 21.83 feet above zero of the chain gage at the highway bridue; and 12. «9 feet over zero of the staff gage in present use. No. 2. A cross cut on the upstream end of the cap of the first pier from the north end of the highway bridge approach. Klevation, 10.91 feet above zero of She chain gage. No. 3. A spot of red paint on the south corner of east abutment on ledge on which uder of the railroad bridge rests. Klevation 14.07 feet above zero of the staff gage in present use. iSeptember, 1914.) Channel. The channel is comparatively straight at the point where meas - urements are made, but curves at a short distance above and below the bridge. It is probably the best example of a shifting, sandy river bed in the state. Accuracy. So variable is the lied of the river at this point that no perman - ent relation exists between gage height and discharge and ordinary methods cannot be used in making estimates of daily discharge. A chart showing the change which took place in the cross section in leas than fourteen days is printed herewith. Also a chart showing the futility of applying ordinary methods of computation. Frequent actual measurements of discharge together with special methods de - scribed in various -United States Geological Survey Water Supply Papers have made it possible to make daily estimates which are fair. </seg>

It will be noticed that the length of chain, and the gage datum at this station is different than that recorded in various reports. This is due both to a lengthening of the chain not having been corrected in previous years, and to the settling of the bridge during the higher water of 1915. Frequent measurements were made during 1915, and this new datum is estab - lished on a basis of the present condition of the old gage and referred in this way to the permanent bench mark. No change in datum 1 given in 1915 records. No records during winter months nor after Mar 1, 1916. </seg>

            <seg id="p365">320 REPORT OF THE ASSISTANT STATE ENGINEER, ON STATE FARM PAVING In the year of 1915, for the first time in its history, the State of Nebraska engaged in real road building, using convict labor, and 1 think it would be appropriate to give at least a short history of the work at this time: Two years ago, a paring district was created on that part of the road extending along the south and east sides of the State Agricultural School at Lincoln. The Legislature of 1914 realizing the advantage of the improvement, appropriated the sum of $35,000 to pay for its share of the work and stipulated that the Governor, at his discretion, might let the work by contract, or build the state's portion by the use of con - rict labor. After careful consideration, the Governor, Mr. John H. More - head, decided on the latter course. He designated George E. Johnson. State Engineer, to arrange for the buying of the material, and gp.ve W. D. J. Steckelberg, Assistant State Engineer, the position of actual supervisor of the work. By arrangement with the contractor, the work was evenly divided, the State taking the west end of the street and the contractor the other portion. tThe contracts for supplying the material were finally completed by middle of August, and also arrangements were made to house the men in the "Stock Judging Pavilion" of the State Kara. The first men to arrive on the work from the penitentiary, or the "Stir" as they called it, came on the 27th day of August. There were but six men. I will never forget the look of joy and hope on those boys' faces. Ten minutes after their arrival work was started. First a barn, which was loaned to the State by Woods Bros. Kelley Co. had to be floored, as it was to be used as a cement store house. That finished, five cars of cement were unloaded and stored for future use. At the same time, three men were busily engaged making th«- forms to be used in building the curb. The concrete mixer was next set up and a temporary water main laid up to it. The Superintendent decided that the work could be more econ - omically handled by mixing all the concrete at one plant, and hauling it to the point desired in wagons. This scheme had the disadvantage of requiring the use of more teams and wagons, but to offset this, the material required less handling and time was saved by not having to move the mixer every two hundred yards or so. The curbing was finished on the 2nd of October, and the concrete baaa was started exactly one week later, hut was not finished until </seg>

            <seg id="p367">321 BOARD OF IRRIGATION, HIGHWAYS AND DRAINAGE November 6. This delay was due to the amount or grading to be done, and the inability to obtain teams. In view of this, the superintendent attempted to sublet the grading, as is the common practice on this kind of work, to some grading outfit, with the proper equipment, argu - ing that the saving in time and money would more than justify the sav - ing if nothing else, but this was over-ruled, and so all of this work had to be done by hand. Before the concrete base was finished, the brick was being hauled and piled on each side of the street. Sand was next hauled and dumped at proper intervals in sufficient quantities for the cushion. The actual finishing began on November 9. This consisted in spreading the sand, shaping it true and the laying, rolling and filling the interstices of the brick with pitch. The first afternoon, 950 square yards of street were laid in four hours. This average could not be maintained on account of the weather and the inability of the contractor, who did the hauling, to handle the brick fast enough. However, the road was opened to traffic at nine o'clock on Thanksgiving day, November 25, 1916. I would like to say a word about these last two days. On the afternoon of the 24th, the last bricks were laid and the pitch gang with two heating kettles, figured that they could finish the re - mainder by working a couple of hours overtime in the evening. Sev - eral newspaper reporters who came out to see the finish were told, by the Superintendent, that the street would be opened to traffic the next morning. As luck would have it, the last reporter had hardly disap - peared when one of the tar kettles sprung a leak and was rendered use - less. This meant that the road could not be opened for another day at least. After debating among themselves, these men of the pitch gaag, ronvfets if you will, volunteered to work all night in order to keep the word of the superintendent. This they did. cheerfully and faithfully, for twenty-six hours continuously without sleep or rest. Consequently the 25th of November was after all a day of thanksgiving. The following Saturday, all the rented equipment was either re - turned, or on its way. the men packed up their belongings and returned once again to complete paying their debt to society. The superintendent is pleased to state that he is more than pleased with the results am 1 has nothing but praise for the way in which the men responded to the demands of the work.

The prices were the same as paid by the City of University Place for the same and adjoining work. In addition, the contractor has filed a bill with this office for $994.51, being one-half the cost of drainage and bridge work on Holdrege Street and on Warren Avenue. I have refused to approve this claim and recom - mend that it be disallowed as I find no provision in the appropriation bill covering this class of work, and the county has an annual levy for the payment of same. </seg>
            <seg id="p370">325 BOARD OF IRRIGATION, HIGHWAYS AND DRAINAGE ROAD MATERIALS OF NEBRASKA PART ONE STONE By G. E. CONDRA, Director of the State Conservation and Soil Survey. There is widespread interest in the improvement of public road* in Nebraska, both state and national. Nebraska in co-operation with the fed - eral government is to embark upon an extensive plan of road develop - ment. One of the first considerations in road building is the material avail - able for construction. The Nebraska Legislature of 1913 with this in view, enacted a statute covering the survey of the state's road building materials and placed the work under the State Conservation and Soil Survey with instructions to proceed as rapidly as possible consistent with good work. Later, the State Advisory Highway Commission urged the Survey to complete the work on road materials. This survey of road materials has been carried on as fast as possi - ble with the limited funds available for its support, and we present here - with a preliminary report which, it is hoped, may be of some use to those engaged in road building. The survey is far from completion, hence a detailed report cannot be made at this time. It is not the purpose here to discuss the different phases of engineer - ing involved in road making, or the engineering of road materials. Each of these subjects will require a special bulletin in the future. The author has received assistance in the preparation of this report from Professors N. A. Bengtson, George R. Chatburn. and C. E. Micney of the State University, from Mr. George Johnson. State Engineer, Mr. Leslie Nichols and from Mr. J. G. Mclntosh, H. F. Wetherbee, Edgar Kiddoo, John J. Lyons and others of the Conservation and Soil Survey. It is sometimes said that Nebraska is without road materials. Per - sons claiming as much are not fully conversant with the facts for there are several road building materials within the state. The chief ones of these are sand, gravel, limestone, sandstone, shale, and several kinds of soil and subsoil. Our reports treat these materials under the headings "Stone," "Sand," and "Soil." Field Studies. — The writer and assistants have visited and studied many of the stone outcrops in Nebraska. This work has continued </seg>
            <seg id="p371">326 over a period of several years. Though the field investigations are far from complete, and should be extended with great detail, it seems that enough data are at hand to warrant publication. Field work on structure was done under difficult conditions. It was not easy to do accurate structure work because of the presence at most plac3s of a thick overburden, which obscures the outcrops. This made the determination and mapping of constants especially difficult. By persistent effort the distribution of the leading stone members has been determined and it is thought that a description of these will be of value to road builders. Samples of stone from all the leading members or ledges, as they are sometimes called, were collected for testing at the University. Laboratory Tests. — The University of Nebraska is well supplied with standard equipment for testing the physical properties of road materials. Professor C. E. Mickey of the Department of Applied Mechanics of the Engineering College directed the testing of the samples supplied by the State Conservation and Soil Survey. The principal specifications in testing road materials are hardness, toughness, and cementing value. The tests of Nebraska stone made under Professor Mickey's direction were on weight per cubic foot, water asorptiou, abrasion, hardness, toughness, and cementing value. The following brief raview of the quali - ties tested in stone, is taken mostly from U. S. Department of Agriculture Bulletin 347, "Methods for the Determination of the Physical Properties of Road Building Rock." March 17. 1916. Weight per cubic foot. — The object is to determine the weight of ■ cubic foot of the solid material. The weight of the cubit- foot is ui value in estimating the weight of any t.ven volume, as a cubic yard or car load of the crushed rock. Percentage of water absorption. — This test determines the amouni of water absorbed by one cubic foot of stone in H6 hours. The valut of the test is in judging the probable lasting qualities of the rock and the action of frost, since the presence of water in the rock is liable u promote disintegration. The higher the water absorption the s.ivjtei the disintegrating effect of frost Abrasion test. — The object of the test is to determine the percent of wear. The abrasion test determines the hardness and toughness of rock simultaneously and probably is the best indicator of the wearing qualities of a material. The per cent of wear runs from as low as 1 in rare cases to as high as 30 or 40 for some sandstones and limestones. This is important because of the general use of roads by autos and the wear caused by such traffic. Hardness. — "Hardness is the property which a rock should possess in order to successfully resist the abrasive action of traffic especially iron tires of vehicles which tend to grind to dust the individual fraements </seg>
            <seg id="p372">327 ARD )F IRRIGATION, HIGHWAY AND DRAINAGE of rock forming the wearing surface of macadam roads." The object of the hardness test is to determine the resistance a rock offers to the displacement of surface particles by friction. The test is of value in determining the resistance of a rock to the grinding action of traffic. The co-efficient of hardness for various types of rock runs from 0 for very soft limestones and sandstones to 19.7 for the hardest varieties of quartzite. The terms used to denote hardness have the following values: 14 or lower, soft; 14 to 17, medium; above 17, hard. Toughness. — "Toughness is the property a rock should possess to successfully resist fracture under the impact of traffic." The object of this test is to determine the resistance the material offers to fractures due to impact. The value of the test is in determining the compara - tive resistance of rock to the impact of traffic produced by the action of horses' hoofs, etc., on the stone forming the wearing course of a macadam road. Toughness in rock varies through a wide range of value from as low as 2 or 3 in the case of some limestones and sand - stones to as high as 60 in rare instances. Below 13 is low; 13 to 19 is medium: and 19-t- is high. Cementing value. — "Binding or cementing value, as it is more fre - uently known, is the ability which the dust of a rock should possess or develop by contact with water, so as to bind or cement the larger rock iragments together and prevent their displacement under the shaaring action of traffic. This property is especially valuable in water-bound ma - cadam construction since it is depended on to maintain the integrity of the wearing course as the road surface is worn off by traffic." The object of this test is to determine the ability which the rock powder when wet possesses of binding the larger fragments together. The test gives a very good preliminary idea of the binding power of the materials. The result? vary enormously, running from 0 for pure quartz to very high in the case of clays. They are used as follows: Below 10, low; 10 to 25. fair; to 75, good: 76 to 100, very good: above 100, excellent. </seg>

Four systems of bed rock formations outcrop in Nebraska and pro - duce stone for road building. They are the Pennsylvanian, Permian, Cre - taceous and Tertiary. Pennsylvanian Formations The oldest formations exposed in Nebraska, the Pennsylvanian, out rop in the southeastern counties. They consist principally of lime- stones and shales, as shown by outcrops at or near Louisville, South li. -ml. Weeping Water, N?hawka, Plattsmouth, Nebraska City, Auburn. Rulo. Falls City. Table Rock and Roca. The total exposed thickness of these formations is between 800 and 900 feet. There are other and lower urination of the system not exposed in our state. The Pennsylvanian ivisions are plainly stratified, and, except where modified by deforma- tions, such as folds and small faults, lie nearly horizontal or dip westward under formations of later age. Deformations. — Among the best denned deformations in the Pennsyl - vania!! beds are those near Table Rock and Nehawka. Figure 2 shows that these strata bend downward along the Missouri between ('ass County and the Kansas line. Figure 3, representing the Platte Section, shows also the north end of the Nehawka anticline. Figure 4 is a section along Weeping Water from east of Union to and beyond Wabash. In this section the Nehawka anticline carries the beds upward by two bends, and the highest point is between Nehawka and Weeping Water. The exact outline of the Nehawka anticline is not known and cannot be worked out without prospecting by drilling because drift and loess cover the bed rock in much of the upland. The Nehawka anticline extends in a north - east, southwest course, but its exact form and area are not known. The Table Rock anticline (see Figure 5) rises more than 400 feet above what would be the normal position of the strata. Its axis as shown by exposures, extends from north of Tecumseh, past Elk Creek, Table Rock and DuBois. Though the strata along the little Nemaha, between the Table Rock and Nehawka anticlines, are much higher than in the Missouri River section, they are lower than in the anticlines. Between Bennett and Roca. the strata are nearly level, but are thought to form what appears to be a low broad anticline extending in a north-south direction. </seg>

"Generalized Section of the Pennsylvanian Beds. — The divisions are iii-rc arranged from the oldest exposed, upward in the order of their superposition and age. Though most members of this generalized section, both limestone and shale, extend throughout the Pennsyl - vanian area of Nebraska, it should be understood that certain ones of them do not. The sequence of formations is shown by Roman numerals and their limestone members by Arabic numbers. The shales separate the limestones and practically all we give for them is their thickness. The generalized section follows: I Lawrence (Andrew) Shales, thickness 80 to 90 feet exposed in the Weeping Water Valley, lower Platte and at Plattsmouth. These are the Lawrence shales of Kansas and the Andrew of Iowa. The Lawrence shales of Nebraska contain four limestones, num - bered 1 to 4 in our section. They are as follows: 9. Meadow Limestone, 2Vi to 4 fret. Shale. 5 to 6 feet. 10. Union Limestone, thickness in the Missouri River section, 6 to 8 feet •'The Pennsylvanian Formations of Southeastern Nebraska," Condra and Bengtson. 1. Nehawka Limestone, thickness 10 feet.

An important source of brick clay. The Howard Limestone of Kansas and the shale below ara included in this division for Nebraska. The Howard Limestone is exposed in the creek south of DuBois and in the bluffs near the southeast - ern corner of the state, but has practically no value for building purposes. Nemaha Formation, thickness, 110 to 130 feet This formation includes 5 workable limestones and 4 shale mem bers. It is best developed in the Big Nemaha Valley with ex posures between Tecumseh and DuBois, and between Falls City and Rulo. There are outcrops north of Rulo, between Union and Nebraska City. The name for this formation was proposed by the writer and Professor Bengtson. The divisions of the formation are as follows: 14. Rulo Limestone, 1 to 2 feet Shale, 7 to 9 feet. 15. Burlingame Limestone, 5 to &lt; feet. The name Burlingame appears to have been used for three different ledges in Kan - sas, all of which extend into Nebraska. Just what is the cor - rect usage is not known. Shale, 28 to 30 feet. 16. Fargo Limestone, 3 to 5 feet Shale, 30 to 34 feet. 17. Preston Limestone, 6 to 11 feet Shale, 30 to 45 feet.. 18. Tarkio Limestone, 5 to 6 feet. This ledge is often confused with the well known Cottonwood Limestone. McKisaock Grove Shales, thickness 95 to 120 feet. This division is known as the McKissock Grove shales in Iowa and is pan of the Admire formation of Kansas. It is well shown in the Nemaha section where it contains much arenaceous shale and several thin seams of coal. The division is prominently exposed in the vicinity of Falls City and along the Missouri near Nebraska City and Peru. The member has local developments of very hard sandstone which has local use.

This is one of the best horizon markers in the state. The sione is light colored and contains myriads of small fossils about the form and size of a rice grain. X The Garrison Formation, thickness less than 100 feet. This forma - tion contains shales and thin limestones. Nearly all of the mem - bers are covered with mantle rock. Only about 20 feet of the base of the formation is exposed east of the Table Rock anticline. To the west of this anticline along the line between Pawnee and Gage counties, but covered by mantle rock, may be a thickness of nearly 100 feet. The thickness reported in Kansas to the south 140 feet Permian Beds. Overlying the Pennsylvanian beds and exposed principally in the Big Blue Valley are strata of the Permian system. (See Figure 6.) The best 1 -fined outcrops of these are in the vicinity of Blue Springs and Wymore. The Permian contains variegated shales, limestones, and flinty limestones. The total thickness here as determined from incomplete exposures is lought to be about 220 feet. The Pennsylvanian beds grade gradually to the Permian without a definite line of demarcation. In fact the livisional line in Nebraska is not marked by either fossil or structure ilifferences. The members of the Permian system In Nebraska are: Wreford Limestone, 1 to 3 feet exposed. This division is 40 or more feet thick in Kansas and would show a greater thick - ness in Nebraska, if not covered with mantle rock. Matfield Shales, 65 feet. Florence Flint, 20 to 24H feet. 8. Fort Riley Limestone, 42 to 45 feet. Doyle Shale*, 60 to 70 feet. 9. Winfield Formation, about 20 feet exposed. The higher members of the Permian do not outcrop in Nebraska. It here, they are covered by mantle rock and may be somewhat thinner than in Kansas. It is thought that there are additional developments of the Permian under western Nebraska, leading up to the "red beds" of- later age. There is no need for considering them in this connection. </seg>
            <seg id="p385">334 REPORT OF STATE ENGINEER Cretaceous Beds. The thrrd system of rocks of importance in Nebraska is of Creta ceous ags. (See Figures 1 and 7.) These beds lie unconformably on the Permian on some later beds of central and western Nebraska. Among the best exposures are those along the Missouri from Boyd County, to Dakota County, in Jefferson County, along the Republican from Superior to Indian ola, and in Hat Creek and White River basins. The beds dip gently west ward except where they lie nearly horizontal or are deformed. Several distinct deformations are shown by small faults and by folds. The two best marked anticlines are in the vicinity of Cambridge and northeast of Chadron. The thickness of the Cretaceous increases from east to »esi reaching a maximum of what is thought to be between 2,500 and 3.00" feet. The formations are composed principally of shale, sandstone and chalk. The divisions are as follows: 30. Dakota formation, 300 to 400 feet. Graneros Shale, 50 to 30n feet or mop 1. Greenhorn Limestone, IS to 30 feet Carlile Shales, 100 to K feet. _ Niobrara chalk rock. Ml to 4»n feet Pierre Shale, 100 or less to about 1 .000 feet. Laramie formation, thickness ?. This division has distribution in the southwestern counties. It is expo a very small area in the western part of Scottsbluff count and is thought to underly several hundred square miles t Nebraska. See Figure 1. There are stone resources in the Dakota, Greenhorn and Niobrars which are described at another place in this report. Aside from thes&lt; the Cretaceous stone has little value in Nebraska. The shales and clay have importance. Tertiary Formations. Lying on an uneven surfa&lt; e of the various Creta her are two thick groups of Tertiary age. They are exposed as far east as shown by Figure 1. These deposits are separable into two leading divisions, formerly known as the White River group and the Loup Fork beds. The studies of Darton and others published in 1'rofessional Papers 17 and 32 of the United States Geological Survey divide the White River beds or lower part of Nebraska's Tertiary into two main divisions, the Chadron beds and the Brule Clay. These formations are distinctly sedimentary, plainly stratified, and mostly of clayey texture. The upper Tertiary deposits (Loup Fork beds) are separable into three main di - visions known as the Gering, Arikaree and Ogal'ala formations. They have wide distribution in central and western Nebraska. Figure 8 shows a cross section of the western counties and the distribution of tbese formations in that area. </seg>
            <seg id="p386">335 IF IRRIGATION, HIGHWAYS AND DRAINAGE ARD The sequence of Tertiary deposits is as follows: Chadron Formation, thickness 100 to 200 feet. This consists of sandy clays and greenish gray sandstones. As a rule the stone is too friable and soft for use, but there are places where it has been worked to good advantage for rip rap and for building purposes, as near Henry, Scottsbluff county. The Chadron is prominently exposed In White River Valley. Brule Clay, thickness 200 to 800 feet or more. This formation is a pink to flesh colored, arenaceous silty clay, but carries some stone grading between limestone and sandstone. This stone has only minor value for local use. The Brule clay reaches a thickness of fully 800 feet at places in the North Pla'.te Valley. It well exposed in Scottsbluff Mountain and outcrops very generally in White River Valley, Hat Creek Basin, North Plalte Valley, Pumpkin Creek Valley, and Lodge - pole Valley, and at a few points along the Niobrara and upper courses of the Loup rivers. Gering Formation, thickness 50 to 200 feet. This formation is quite sandy, at most places a friable sandstone. It forms the nearly vertical walls in the Pine Ridge country and in parts of the North Platte and Pumpkin Creek valleys and may be present in the Niobrara Valley in the vicinity of Valen- tine Ankaree Formation, thickness 50 to 600 feet. The beds of the Arikaree formation are separable into three main divisions as shown by fossils. The Arikaree has a very wide distribution over the northwestern part of the state, but gives way at or near the Pumpkin Creek Valley on the south to the Ogallala formation. The principal content of the Arikaree is light grayish sand, yet it carries large quantities of lime, some clay, pebbles and stone. The sands are cemented at places forming friable stone. 34. Ogallala Formation, thickness 50 to 200 feet. This formation occurs in the southwestern part of the state from the Republi - can Valley westward to Wild Cat Range of the North Platte Valley area. The Ogallala contains a considerable amount of lime and sand and has thin beds of soft limestones at places. The lime binds the sand and pebbles into sand and pebble rock </seg>

Such tests as have been made show the fol- ding averages: Weight. 164 to 167 pounds per cubic foot: absorption, .48 to 0.74; per cent of wear, 1.95 to 3.1; compression strength, 9,500 to 11,815; hardness. 12 to 17; toughness, 4 to 7; cementing value, 65 to 118. The stone differs somewhat in the various outcrop areas and it will require additional field and laboratory work to supply data sufficient for a definite statement. The stone is quite heavy, and comparatively durable. It is extensively produced in the formed of crushed rock. None of this is hard enough for use in the wearing surface of concrete roads.

The Cottonwood is distinguished by its massive appearance, myriads of small fossils about the size of a rice grain, its very light color, and the presence at places of geodes and concretions. The geodes are less common than the concretions. The concretions are largely of flint. The principal areas in which the Cottonwood has been quarried are near Glen Rock, and northeast of Johnson, both in the Little Nemaha Valley, and at a number of points along the Big Nemaha and the South Fork, as between Humboldt and Salem.

The second division from the top contains myriads of oyster like fossils. It is irregularly bedded, usually brownish and contains some clay and sand. It is best suited for rip rap. In some exposures the basal divisions of the Green - horn limestone are soft and massive like the Niobrara chalk rock. This ■ mlirioii is particularly noticeable in exposures near Ponca. The Greenhorn Limestone outcrops in Dixon. Dakota, Seward. Jef - ferson and Thayer counties, where it usually forms a light colored streak a the uplands. This condition is particularly noticeable in Jefferson ounty. The principal quarries in the Greenhorn are located 5 miles orthwest of Kairbury, a few miles northeast of Gladstone, north of Gilead, south of Kesterson and in the vicinity of Hubbell. The Greenhorn has been used at many places for walks, buildings, posts and road work, but is not of much commercial importance because of its softness and limited supply. Niobrara Chalk: lis is the thickest deposit of stone in Nebraska. (Figure 32.) It is prominently exposed along the Missouri River between Cedar and Hoyd counties. Niobrara is the place from which the stone was named. Here the massive chalk rises nearly 100 feet above the river, and less Mian half its thickness is exposed. The Niobrara formation has a relatively wide distribution in southern and south-central Nebraska. It first appears under the loess in the val- ley of the Little Blue above Angus, at Nelson, in central Nuckolls county, and farther south on either side of Smyrna, and near Bostwick. The for - mation outcrops most extensively along the Republican and its tribu - taries,- and rises high in the slopes south of Guide Rock, gradually lower - ing westward. It passes below the Pierre shale south of Indlanola, and rises quite high in the Cambridge anticline. The prevailing colors of the Niobrara are lead gray, light gray and yellowish. The chalk is of a porous texture and gives a hollow sound when struck with the hammer. It fractures unevenly and has a tend - ency to break into splinter-like fragments. The chief impurities are clay, silica and gypsum. The basal member of the Niobrara is a massive chalky limestone (Figure 33). bluish to light gray on freshly broken sur - faces. It has a thickness of 40 to 50 feet. The outcrops are marked by prominent ledges capping the softer shales of the Carlile. It is found </seg>

In southern Nebraska the upper part of the Niobrara is 300 feet thick, bluish gray, massive with layers of light colored limestone and calcareous clays throughout. Badly weathered surfaces of the Niobrara are ochreous. In some localities the upper part of the formation con - tains brownish, reddish or greenish flint. These flint beds vary in thick - ness from a few inches to 10 feet. The Niobrara chalk rock is composed largely of very small cal - careous shells. It is of light weight, and soft enough to be easily sawed or carved. There are thin seams of gypsum in the ledges and selinitt - crystals often occur on the weathered slopes. This chalk, though soft, appears to harden somewhat when exposed to the air. It is used in many places for building houses and for road surfacing. Alma was one of the first places in ihe state to use this chalk for road surfacing. The results were more favorable than was expected. The stone breaks up into a powder which binds sandy loam soil quite firmly.

Stone in the Arikaree and Ogalla'a Formations: Each of these formations contains some sandstone, conglomerate, fresh water limestone and what is sometimes called quartzite. The Arikaree (Figure 34), exposed on the valley sides and in the canyons of northwestern Nebraska, contains much friable sandstone, which can be used in very cheap forms of construction. This stone is light gray, massive, and of poor quality, yet it serves well to surface roads leadinu across sandy loam and dune sand soils. Such use of the Arikaree has been made at many places and with good results. Moisture 81O 5 Organic matter SO, CO, CaO Fe : O, and A1 : O.

Drift Boulders. — These occur in the glaciated area of Nebraska but in siraller numbers than in most glaciated states. The boulders vary in size from a few inches in diameter to more than ten feet. These boulders represent several kinds of rock. Sioux quartzite, found in at least three colors — pink, purplish red and brownish red, constitutes fully half the drift boulders exposed in Nebraska. There are granites of several kinds, and syenites, gneiss, mica and hornblende schists, greenstone and trap - rock. One or more forms of each of these can be collected at most typical drift exposures in the state. Limestone and sandstone boulders are quite common in the drift. The laraest boulder areas in the state are southeast of Endicott, (Figure 38) southeast of Table Rock, northwest of Tecumseh, about eight mileB southeast of Humboldt, northeast of Germantown and west of Denton. Though the drift boulders of Nebraska have been used for a number of purposes as in marking land corners, and in foundations, walls ani general concrete construction, their value is comparatively unimportant. </seg>

In fact the use of thte stone for cement manu - facture may become of importance in the future. The chalk would be mixed with either the Granerose shale below or the Pierre shale above, depending on the condition in which it outcrops with respect to these shales. There is no question that the Niobrara chalk and Granerose shale, when properly combined, can be made into high grade cement. This has been done at Superior. Several years ago very good cement was made at Yankton, South Dakota, by using the chalk rock and Pierre shale There are several sites in Nebraska where cement mills could be in - stalled to work the Niobrara and shales. One of these is near the town of Niobrara. It is reported that the cement plant at Superior will be reopened this year, and it is hoped that road builders will extend it every encourage - ment possible. One drawback here is fuel. This drawback will be solved if oil and gas are found in the apparently favorable structures which are known to cross the Republican Valley and to occur also in Kansas. The cement materials are available. Good management and cheap fuel, it" applied to these materials, would make Nebraska an important cement oroducing state. IOITHKAHT &lt;&gt;K KNDIOOTT </seg>

            <seg id="p427">376 REPORT OF STATE ENGINEER STONE PRODUCTION IN SOUTHEASTERN NEBRASKA This part of the state leads in stone production, for the most pai from limestone, some from the Dakota sandstone. The stone is produced in well defined districts, viz.: Lower Plattt Weeping Water, Little Neniaha, Bis Nemaha, Missouri River and Bi Blue. This discussion refers to the conditions under which stone is pro duced in Nebraska and to the quarrying, crushing, shipment and ust - of the stone. It does not show the volume of production. Overburden — Nebraska stone is exposed principally in valley iMcs. The quarry faces are worked alonK outcrops and into the slope land Working the slopes causes the overburden to become gradually thicker and therefore expensive to remove. This condition has caused the abandonment of many quarries. Most quarries when first opened wo along the exposed stone rather than into the upland. This gi\»&gt; Hi or strings of small openings along the outcrops of the different st&lt;&gt; members. In most cases, a single ledge is worked and the overburd is deposited on or above a more valuable ledge of stone below. Though the state has thirty-four distini t horizons or stone prod members, the workable area, from which there can lie economic pr duct ion, is quite limited. This is mainly because of heavy overburdet If the stone deposits were thicker, it would require relative stripping. In some localities it is necessary to strip overburden than the amount of stone. A second unfavorable condition ri amount of interbedded shale which must be removed if more that limestone member is quarried in a given exposure Weathered Stone. — Quarrying in Nebraska not only fails to iwd far into the hill sides, but it also fails to produce the best quality at stone Mostly weathered rock is worked and the fresh stone remains, excep in the largest quarries. At some places the workable stone does occur near the surface over a considerable area of land. But as a rule, where this condi tion is found, the stone to be quarried is thin and not of the best quality 1 refer here to the Cottonwood Limestone as it occurs northeast of John son and in the vicinity of Glen Rock. Working a Slope. — It is quite evident that stone quarrying in Ne - braska must be placed on a different basis if the supplies are to last for a long time. To date the hill sides have been gophered out, many of the more valuable deposits have been covered, and the best stone remains in the slope land. A larger plan of development would call for the working of a whole hill side and the production for some purpose of each limestone and shale member. The limestones, differing in quality. </seg>

This proceedure will be imperative if our stone and shale re - ire to be available during a long period of state development. M importation of stone from other states will delay the time when is practice will he followed in Nebraska. Local Use Quarries. There are several hundred local use quarries te state, some in most counties. Quarrying for purely local use was lone more a few years ago than it is at this time. The stone was re - noved largely by hand, i. e., by hand drilling, simple blasting, pick and row bar. and breaking with sledge and hammer. Such quarrying resulted n production from each of the 34 horizons and from additional thin un - lanied ledges. Commercial Quarries. — Among the largest commercial quarries in this ate arc those near South Bend, Meadow, Louisville, Cedar Creek, Xe- hawka, Weeping Water. Wymore and Blue Springs. At most of these places, a large force of men is employed in the quarry operations. Steam. electricity and compressed air are used in these quarries. Much of the stone is crushed for use in concrete. Among the leading quarry companies operating in the state are: Rurlington Quarry, South Bend: National Stone Company, and Murphy Construction Co., Louisville; Woodworth Quarry, Meadow; Atwood Quarry, Cedar Creek: Western Stone Company, Nehawka; Olson's Quarry, Weeping Water; Davis Quarry, Wymore; Blue Springs Quarry, Blue Springs. Stone Aggregate. The question has arisen many times as to whether Nebraska stone is suitable for aggregate in concrete. Some maintain that all our stone is suitable for such purpose. Others hold that Nebraska stone is unsuited for this purpose. The fact is that there are many uses of concrete, some of which require stone of a particular quality, and others of which can use low grade stone. Practically all of the Pennsyl - vanian members herein described will do for use in ordinary concrete. Farts of the Plattsmouth, about 16 feet of the Deer Creek, the Meadow, 8 feet of the Louisville, about 6 feet of the South Bend, and 10 feet of the Ashland limestone make aggregate suited to a somewhat higher grade of construction, but are not hard enough for the wearing course of concrete roads. The Permian members serve for cheap concrete construction, for road and pavement foundations, and fairly well as rail - road ballast. The Greenhorn Limestone and the Niobrara chalk are too soft for aggregate. The quartzite in the Arikaree and Ogallala forma - tions seem to make the best aggregate of any Nebraska stone. Care should be taken, however, to use only solid materials free from cavities and soft impurities. </seg>

Immediately north of the Fisheries is a small exposure of limestone below heavy overburden. Opposite South Bend.— Some of the first quarrying was done in the slopes across the Platte from South Bend, near the east end of the Clarke Bridge. The limestone was hauled to the railroad and shipped out for rip rap, rubble, sugar stone, and dimension stone. Some of the limestone from this locality was used in the State Capitol Building. There are many exposures of limestone and sandstone between the State -Fish Hatcheries and one-half mile north of the Rock Island bridge.

Sand is Nebraska's most important mineral resource. It is widely Iisiritiutfd. and extensively m'ned for a number of uses including general liuilding and road work. There are about 800 sand pits in the state, picducing principally or local use, and more than thirty laree commercial pits, sand pumping nations, and sand dredges The production of these plan's is shipped hroughout the state and to parts of Iowa, Missouri and Kansas.

Physical Properties of Sand Though sand is used extensively, as a rule, it is not tested as it should be to determine its properties and fitness for these uses. The principal properties of sand are cleanness, fineness or size of grain, sharpness, and the mineral content. Certain other qualities deserve consideration in a description. They are color, specific gravity, weight :iii(i voids. Cleanness.— The qualities of sand are essentially those of the grains which compose it but there may be present also, more or less extraneous </seg>

There are simple methods of determining cleanness but they are not h used. It is possible to estimate this property by sight without the uipment. Proof that a sand has a low degree of cleanness is *n by placing a sample in a vessel containing water and agitating A diny sample will badly discolor the water. Perfectly clean sand will not soil the hand. Such a degree of clean - . liowevt-r, is rarely found. Much of Nebraska sand shows a high of cleanness. This is especially true of the production from the district. FmeneM. — This property relates to the size of grains and has more &gt;nance than is generally supposed. It deserves careful considera- &gt;y builders of roads and pavements. The most common means inn tireness is by the use of sieves.

It is the opposite of rm sand in which the grains are mostly of the same size. Engineers i of what is called the "uniformity coefficient" which shows the de - of uniformity of grains, i. e. whether they are mainly of the same \&gt; ;i rule Nebraska's sands are graded. This is a favorable condi - because it makes them heavy and low in voids. Sharpness and Form of Grain. — Practically ail specifications made a years since strongly emphasized sharpness and angularity, regard- use to be made of a sand. We now know that sharpness has istiniated. and that there is some virtue in sand with rough, I grains, if they are composed of hard, durable minerals III. qualities sharpness and form can be determined by a low power ? or by pressing the sand between the fingers. Sharp sand has a uliar grit, in contrast with the sound produced by round sand. Sands sometimes classed as sharp, angular and round. Most of Nebraska's 1 is angular to round, not sharp.

            <seg id="p447">396 REPORT OF STATE ENGINEER t Specific Gravity and Weight. — Building sand is composed mostly of &gt;rals having specific gravities from 2.57 to 3.0. Certain minor in - tents are heavier. Most Nebraska sand ranges in specific gravity i 2.6 to 2.66. the average being about 2.64 or 2.65. (Specific gravity does not have much importance, especially so where ? sands run evenly as they do in Nebraska. It is of use, however determining voids by the specific gravity weight method. »The weight of a sand sample depends on the mineral content, grad - and compaction. It is usually given in pounds, the volume considered ng a cubic foot. A simple method for determining this property is weight a cubic foot of sand in a vessel of standard size. kDry, compact sand weighs from 75 to 100 pounds or more per ■ foot. Dry, compact, graded sand runs much higher. Nebraska , being graded, runs between 88 and 125 pounds per cubic foot. I Voids. — The term "void" means unoccupied. It is practically the ne as space. Engineers use the term "voids" to denote the percentage inter-grain space. Voids as a property has most importance in sand ■d in mortar or concrete. The voids is low in graded sand and high uniform sand. It is greater in fine than in coarse sand. The range Nebraska sands is between M and 48. The methods of determining voids are well known, yet it seen a word of caution should be given in regard to the hydration n By this test a volume of sand is measured, and water sufficient to spaces is introduced. The water required to fill the sand is, test is carefully made, equal to the voids. The difficulty in this to drive out all the air in the sand spaces. Hence, the test shows too low in voids. The most common means of testing voids in t lie laboratory is hy the specific gravity weight method. In this, the first step is to find the specific gravity of the sand, which for the most of the samples collected from deposits in Nebraska is 2.64 or 2.65. If the specific gravity is 2.65, 100 cubic centimeters of solid rock would weight about 2ti:&gt; grams, but the weight of 100 cubic centimeters of sand is about 1«3 grams, mak - ing a difference of 102 grams between the solid and the sand, due to voids. The next step is to find what percent 1ii2 is of JB5. which gives a result of 38.49, the voids. A larger measure, the cubic foot, is used in field operations. The specific gravity being L'.t;r&gt; a cubic foot of sanil weighs about 110 pounds, whereas an equal volume of a solid composed of the same materials as the sand, would weigh about 166.625 pounds, making a difference of 55.625 pounds per cubic foot. This represents the weight of sand that would fill the voids. The reckoning is finished by finding what percent 55.625 is of 165.625. In practical work the opera - tion of determining voids is about as follows: Weigh a cubic foot of sand moderately compact, subtract the weight from 165.625, divide the difference by 165.625 and the result represents the voids. </seg>

HIGHWAYS AND MAIN AGE The heavy sands of Nebraska are low in voids, and light ones are high n void CHEMICAL COMPOSITION Sand is finely divided rock. Its composition is determined largely by the material from which it was derived. For example, sand may originate from such as coral rock, iron ore, or granite. Much of Ne - braska's sand was derived from quartz and feldspar which came from granite. The largest ingredient is quartz. This, when pure, is com - posed of silica 1S1O i, and contains about 46.6 per cent silicon and 53.33 per cent oxygen. Feldspar, mica, hornblende and other silicate minerals, usually present, make the composition more complex, adding alumina &lt;Alo I, potassium oxide (K..0), sodium oxide (Na,0). calcium oxide (CaO), magnesium oxide (MgO), and iron oxide (Fe,O,). In association with the sand grains may be iron stain, clay filler, and calcium carbonate. Forms of iron oxide are sometimes present as stain on sand grains. Clay im - purities are essentially hydrated silicates of alumina. Limestone is mostly calcium carbonate, CaCO3. Chemical analyses of sands are approximate and ultimate. Approxi - mate analyses determine only the SIO,, A1..0, and iron content This takes little time, whereas ultimate analyses are time-consuming and expensive. wmmmm t ijl AIITZ AMI KKI.IWAi: (iKAINS </seg>

As a rule these occur as the larger particles such as gravel and pebbles. They should be of special interest to operators who product - aggregate from sand.

SAND BEARING FORMATIONS Most of Nebraska's sand is derived from mantle rock deposits. A small amount is secured from bed rock. The geological sources of sand in Nebraska are the Pennsylvanian beds, Dakota Formation, Arikaree Formation, Ogallala Formation, an unnamed Tertiary Formation, glacial drift and alluvial deposits.

Some of tliis is cemented into friable sandstone and conglomerate. Vt places the sand varies from fine to coarse, and the gravel which grades into coarse pebble rock, is loose enough to permit of working without blasting. The sand and gravel are heavily charged with cal - areous matter. Feldspar pebbles are a noticeable feature. Pebbles of luartz, hornblende, granite, basalt, and other minerals and rocks are plentiful. Sand of Late Tertiary Age.— Beneath the loess in much of central Nebraska and extending eastward under the west edge of the glacial deposits is an unnamed formation which carries vast quantities of sand &lt; nt erst ratified with thin layers of day and silt. (Figure 6.) This is nearly continuous sand plain 25 to 100 feet or more thick. It outcrops ong the Missouri in northeastern Nebraska, as in Knox and Cedar i-oun ies, and in the valleys southward and southwestward to and beyond the (epuhlican. The sand is encountered in most upland wells. Just how ar west this sand extends and just what its geological relations are to I rill en the east has not been definitely determined. Though much of the sand in this formation is fine, a large amount is nurse and suitable for production. Much of it is clean, coarse and fit &gt;r structure purposes. The sand is composed principally of quartz but nough particles of feldspar are present to give it a mottled, flesh color. The sand plain in much of its area is covered by loess and drift npt where it outcrops in valleys. This restricts most of the present iduction of sand from this source to valley sides. Future needs may for more mining from beneath the upland plains. Glacial Drift Sands. — These occur in approximately the east cne- third of the siate and in two conditions. The larger amount is in a fairly distinct sand plain known as the Aftonian. (Figure 7.1 This lies between the Nebraskan and Kansan drift sheets and has a thickness ranging from a few feet to 5il feet or more. The sand varies from dirty to clean and from fine sand to coarse gravel. The deposit is strati - fied and cross bedded and contains sorre clay balls and boulders. This means that it is primarily a stream deposit. The Aftonian sands extend through much of the upland of the Loess Hill and Drift Hill areas of Nebraska and are represented also in southwestern Iowa, northwestern Missouri and northeastern Kansas. Among the best exposures of these glacic-f.uvial sands in Nebraska are those near Fairtury, DeWitt, Ulysses. Wahoo. and near Martinsburg, Cixon county.

Dune Sand. — This is the prevailing surface formation of the well known sandhill region and of the outlying sandhill areas. The sand is too fine for roost road work but has been utilized for some purposes. Alluvium. — This is a general name for stream deposits made in valleys. The alluvium of Nebraska varies greatly. In some valleys it is largely clay and silt, in others sand and gravel. The Platte alluvium has vast quantities of sand and fine gravel which serve as a source of commercial production. This alluvium is more than 100 feet deep at places, yet there are points where shales and other bed rock reach close the surface of the valley floor. The soil and subsoil proper of the Platte Valley vary considerably in texture, structure and thickness, but as a rule are not very thick over the alluvial sand. A typical section of the Platte alluvium repre- nting the conditions in the areas where the dredges operate, is shown figure 8 The alluvium of the Missouri is finer than that of the Platte. It trades from clay to medium sand. The alluvial deposits of the Repub - lican. Loup and Elkhorn are somewhat coarser grading from fine to medium sands. The alluvium of the Nemahas ranges from clay to fine sand It is too fine for sand production. METHODS OF PRODUCTION md is produced in Nebraska by loading from sand bars, by pit or ank mining, by pumping and by dredging. The first named of these eeds no description. Pit or Bank Mining. — At many places in the state, the sand beds her outcrop or occur near the surface. This makes them accessible for mining, especially so where the sand is above the water level. The sand is in valley sides and on valley floors. Under the first condition. the deposits, being nearly level, extend into the upland, and working nmkes a bank like opening, hence the name bank pit. On smooth land such as a valley plain the working or mining produces a pit like opening. The first thing to do in pit or bank mining is to remove the over - burden. This, called "stripping." is done with team and scraper. In some small pits little overburden is encountered, and working follows along the sand exposure without forming much of an opening. The simplest form of loading in bank pits is by hand shoveling to tarni wagons, (Figure 9) and haulage to points where the sand is used. The owner of a pit charges the neighbors or persons of the community a small amount per load for sand. </seg>

Dredging. — This is done with drawline dredges and clam dredges 11 dredges are operated either by cranes or on double cables. About Aenty dredges lead sand in the state, eight months of the year. Most clam dredges operate along the lower Platte producing from sandy alluvium where the stripping is thin and the water table is if ihf surface. They are located on railroad spurs which extend to essible sand ground near the towns. The cost of a clam dredging ant not including the railroad spur is from $3,000.1)0 to I5.0U0.00. The problem involved in the installation of a dredge is to secure a ■ amount of desirable sand land, favorably located with respect to ansportation facilities and markets. Commercial sand dredging has vantages and limitations. Production by this method is relatively "ap and it enables the producer to secure sand where it could not be ached by shovel or s&lt; raper. Rainy weather does not interfere very tli the operation of the plant. One of the principal drawbacks ability to obtain sand of different degrees of fineness from the the dredges can not readily luad either fine or coarse sand KIEWIT 1'IMl'IMI I'l.ANT XKAK MKAlMiW kii.i kk: in </seg>

In this equipment the bucket fills with sand by the ng force of the drag line cable. The crane or boom swings in a radius of fifty feet or more and dumps to cars, or to a washing and trailing plant. Washing and Grading. — Discussing this subject several years ago. the author wrote: "Thus far, with few exceptions, no attempt has been made to screen or wash sand at the places of production. It would seem that the trade as it is now organizing, would demand a product ready for use. The screening might be done with less expense at the dredges than at the places of sand consumption. As the industry further develops we may expect more up-to-date methods of preparing the product for market. The sand thus prepared will demand a higher price, but the results will be more favorable to all concerned." At this time, ten years after the above was written, most commercial plants are equipped (Figure 13) to produce washed sand, screened to market grades. By the use of wire screens, and revolving screens, and </seg>

Much of the commercial sand is clean. The water brought up in pumping and dredging assists in the cleaning. In fact it performs this purpose. The washing and screening together remove practically all dirt and grains too fine for use. Sand Storage.— The pit run of the dredges is dumped at once into cars. That which is sized for market goes to the drop screening and grading plants and then to cars. In some places the sand is separated into different grades according to fineness and stored in high wedge shaped bins (Figure 13) from which the water drains off and and from which the sand is later dropped into cars for shipment. Commercial Movement. — The output of some sand plants near towns and cities is marketed in sand wagons. Where larger quantities are hauled it is sometimes done in dump wagons which save time and labor. Much of the sand produced at the large pits and dredges is hauled on railroads. It is not an uncommon sight to see half a train of sand drawn from a single loading station. (Figure IS.) Such sand moves to IKilKK 15 Alil.llADS OK SANK. KK'IIKV PLANT. I.I HISVII.I.K </seg>

Persons using river sand. simply drive to a point on a bar where the material looks clean and coarse enough and load what is needed. Though the North Platte alluvium is not very deep, compared with that of some courses of the Platte Valley it contains an enormous amount of good sand material, and the river is bringing down a heavy load from the mountains. This resource seems to be in a condition which might be called inexhaustible. </seg>

The terraces are underlain with sand of no commercial value. The bluffs contain outcrops of a sand plain from which there has been some production as in I'lum and Elk Creek valleys. Most towns in this area are located on first bottom land or on very low benches. They are all underlain with good building sand at shallow depths. Many excavations for foundations have removed sufficient sand for use in the building. This is particularly true at Kearney. The bars and river bed (Figure 19) supply much of the sand used in this part of the valley. The sand is delivered to market in ordinary wagons or in sand wagons. Persons doing the hauling are paid about $1.00 per yard, the amount depending on the distance and whether the sand is free at the river or whether a royalty has to be paid to the land </seg>

            <seg id="p498">447 ARD OF IRRIGATION, HIGHWAYS AND DRAINAGE The material in the process of consolidation will shrink in volume about 50',. An easy method for obtaining a close approximation of the quantity of gravel required for any particular road is to multiply the length of the road in miles, by the width in feet and by the desired thickness (after consolidation) in inches, and the product by twenty-five. The result is the quantity of gravel in cubic yards. For example, sup - pose the road is one-half mile long, twenty feet wide and eight inches thick, then, %x20x8x25=2,000 cubic yards of gravel as measured in wagons at the pit, will be required. This number may be a trifle too large; if the consolidation were always exactly 50%, twenty-four and four-ninths would be the exact multiplier instead of twenty-five. GRAVEL-CONCRETE ROADS Gravel may be substituted for broken stone in concrete roads, i Figure 31.) The chief difficulty in this state has been to obtain a gravel coarse enough for this purpose. The pebbles should form a Kraded mixture with the largest not less than one inch in diameter. a mixture can best be obtained with Nebraska gravel by first ling it into two or three grades and remixing. In this way, the excess sand can be saved and sold for other purposes. If the product could be run over two screens, the first with one-half inch openings, the other forty meshes per inch, it would be divided into three grades — ne sand, coarse sand and gravel. The coarse sand and gravel would lake excellent concrete, the fine sand can be used for plastering and asphalt pavements Ordinarily the ingredients are divided into three parts, the cement i he fine aggregate — sand, and the coarse aggregate — stone or pebbles. The sand should be as hard as flint or quartz. Quartz is the pre- minent mineral in Nebraska sands. Sharpness is no longer considered requisite of good sand. Sharp sands give a little greater mechanical bond but somewhat rounded sands pack closer and make a denser mortar; denseness is more important than the mechanical bond due to sharpness. As a rule, the coarser the aggregate, the better concrete will be made. The pebbles ranging in size from one-fourth inch up to one inch make a good coarse aggregate. Here again the more uniformly coarse the better. Cleanness is an important item in concrete making. If possible, the sand should be reasonably clean. Cleanness may be shown roughly by agitating a quantity of the sand in a glass bottle partly full of water and then allowing it to stand. The fine particles of silt and loam will take considerable time to settle. The sooner the water becomes clear the cleaner the aggregate. When settled the thickness of the layer of fine silt on top will be a measure of the "suspended" matter. This should not exceed W of the total thickness of the aggregate. </seg>

            <seg id="p501">450 KEPORT OF STATE ENGINEER by the sum of the parts of all the ingredients, the quotient is the number of barrels of cement required. As a sack of cement, weighing i»4 pounds, is for practical purposes one cubic foot, and four sacks make one barrel, to get the number of sacks multiply the number of barrels by four. To get the sand or stone in cubic yards multiply the number of sacks of cement by the proportional part of sand or stone used and divide by twenty-seven. For example, to find the quantities of cement, sand, and pebbles necessary to build one-fourth mile of 1:2%: 4 concrete road seventeen feet wide and six inches thick the application of the rule is as follows: — 6732 barrels MMxStt = 2400 cubic yards :'.".:&lt;28x4 1 (JRAVKI.

MARKERS, CULVERTS AND BRIDGES Markers for section and quarter section corners, and for guide boards and danger signs along the highways can be made from Nebraska sand and gravel. (Figure 32.) Wooden forms are easily made and the mortar deposited in them until hard. For extra good work a mixture of one ce- ment to three sand may be used; for work not requiring so good or smooth surface a mixture of 1:4 or 1:5 may be employed. If made moderately dry, and tamped well, until it quakes, better results will be obtained than if mixed slushy. Markers should cure in a shady place for three or four weeks before setting them. The photograph shows a marker designed by Arthur Edgren, County Engineer of Lancaster County. The post contains four reinforcing rods, one near each corner and the slab is reinforced with horizontal and vertical rods. Cast-iron letter molds were attached to the form before putting on the concrete. These leave the letters depressed. The surface was rubbed down with a carborundum brick and the letters painted and varnished. FII.IKE 32 oNCKKTK ROAD MAKKKH &lt;&gt;X OMUTI LINK </seg>

( Figur caster County has for several years manufactured concrete tilins durir the winter months. At this time many men are out of work and MN not that the County can thus supply them with labor would becon charges upon the bounty of the public. A few molds, a pla rk at a foreman constitute the overhead charges. The pipe of course must be transported to the place of use, but usually tins would cost no mon - than transporting the raw materials. I'ipes up to three feet in diameter and three inches in thickness are made without reinforcement. Larger sizes must be reinforced. The mixture is about the same as for the markers mentioned above or the building blocks used for the foundation of a house. Culverts made in place require forms. Some of these are constructed of wood and removed after the hardening cf the concrete by loosening wedges. Others are of steel and iron and are collapsible. In making these culverts it is well to separate the gravel into pebbles and sand and remix. The mixture should be made up in proportions for good building concrete. About 1:2:3 or 1:2:4 will answer very well. Wing walls, parapets and end markers can be constructed of these same materials. </seg>

            <seg id="p505">454 REPORT OF STATE ENGINEER PAVEMENTS Paved roadways have long been in use in the cities (Figure 34) and towns and are rapidly being adopted for rural roads. The material* generally used for pavements are: brick, stone block, wood block, asphalt and concrete. Concrete has already been mentioned. The other ma - terials require a foundation course. This is usually made of concrete. Sand and gravel are applicable for this. A mixture of one cement to two sand, five pebbles will be found satisfactory. By pebbles here is meant all of the gravel that is retained on a one-fourth inch mesh sieve. With a foundation of concrete six inches thick on a well rolled sub - grade no trouble with settlement should ever occur. I K.I KK H SANK t SKll IN STKKKT WoKK. OMAHA </seg>

The sands of Nebraska have ven entirely satisfactory for this form of pavement. A fine sand, st of it passing a No. 50 sieve, is best. The fine sands not desired for concrete foundation may all be used here. When pebbles not exceeding one-half inch in diameter are mixed i a mixture of asphalt and sand, an asphaltic concrete results. Pave- its of this character are a little cheaper in first cost than the asphalt many miles are now being layed in the United States. Sand and 1 gravel are frequently used for a cushion course under the brick cement grout used to fill the spaces between the bricks. ty street pavements require curbs and gutters. These are of late usually made of concrete. Cement, sand and gravel (pebbles less ne-half inch and more than one-fourth inch in diameter) answer veil for this purpose. Sidewalks and carriage drives are made the same materials. Once more, let it be urged that, in the use of Nebraska gravel, it iik fine in character, having lots of sand mixed with it, care should taken first to screen it and then remix in proper proportions. Upon may depend success or failure. </seg>
