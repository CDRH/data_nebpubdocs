            <seg id="p007">FIRST SESSION Two o'clock P. M. Tuesday. Lincoln, Nebr., January 18, 1916 The annual meeting of the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture was called together by Vice-President Ollis. Mr. Ollis: Gentlemen of the State Board of Agriculture, it is time for us to come to order and start the business of this meeting. I feel somewhat embarrassed in coming before you this afternoon in this posi - tion. I suppose you all know, perhaps, that our president, Mr. Roberts is sick. Mr. Roberts has been very sick for about a week or ten days with grippe and while he is better he is in bed yet today and is a pretty sick man. I am sure no member of this State Board of Agriculture is more loved than is Joe Roberts; he has been your president the last two years and all of you have looked up to him and honored him in filling his position as well as he has filled it. I certainly regret very much Mr. Roberts is not able to be with us and know you all feel the same way. The boys got together this forenoon and sent him a box of flowers, in the name of the State Board of Agriculture, feeling it would be just a little token to remind him we have not forgotten him even If he is not with us. The first business before the meeting will be the reading of the call. Mellor: Inasmuch as Mr. Roberts is home sick I move he be excused from attendance at this meeting. Motion seconded and carried unanimously. NOTICE OF ANNUAL MEETING Lincoln, December 10, 1915. The annual meeting of the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture, will be held at the Commercial Club Rooms, Lincoln, on Tuesday, January 18, 1916, at 2 o'clock P. M.

Presidents of regularly organized, live county agricultural societies, which have filed their reports prior to this meeting, are ex-officio members of the Board. If the president cannot attend, the society must elect a delegate, and file authenticated credentials. No proxies are admitted. </seg>

There may be others come in later. </seg>
            <seg id="p011">11 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOABD OF AURK 'ULTUBE Ollis: Moved and seconded that the report be accepted and the com - mittee continued. Any remarks? Hunter: I believe Mr. Grimes was recognized by the committee as the representative from Holt County. Mellon J. H. Hunter too. Hunter: I did not hear the name called. Before we take action on this, you understand there was a controversy last year and it seems this is a continuance of last year's controversy. I handed one member of the committee a certificate from the county clerk of our county a little while ago showing we had received the appropriation for last year and the county board has given the Holt County Fair Association, located at O'Neill, the entire appropriation for this year. We have received it for three years in succession. Of course this matter is in controversy. I do not feel it is hardly right to divide this vote. I have no objection to Mr. Grimes sitting as a member of this convention if the balance of the meeting is perfectly willing he should do that, but we feel we are the regularly organized county society so far as we have any legal decision on it. If you will remember, I handed the findings of the court last year to the committee and was given a seat in the convention. Mr. Grimes was seated afterward and I believe I requested that he be given a seat in this convention but I do not feel like being put off with a half vote. I believe the Holt County Fair Association is entitled to this recognition; the courts have recognized us, the county board has recognized us and we have received this appropriation entirely for three years. Ollis: Did you make that as a motion Mr. Hunter? Hunter: I did not, I do not like to make a motion to seat myself. Ollis: As the report stands J. M. Hunter and J. E. Grimes are recognized as delegates, with a half vote each. Hunter: Bear in mind Mr. Grimes is a representative of an associa - tion known as the South Fork Association. Ollis: There is a motion before the house to adopt the report, and it has to be amended unless the report goes in as it was originally made. McArdle: I move the motion be amended and the Holt County Fair Association or Hunter be given representation in this meeting. Grimes: I am from the South Fork Association Ollis: Do I hear a second? Seconded. Grimes: I do not believe it is giving the South Fork Fair Associa - tion a fair deal. Hunter has stated his side of the question. I do not see why a fair that has been organized for twenty-four years has to lay down for a new society that sprung up three years ago just because the county board has seen fit to allow them the appropriation. We have carried on our fair and been recognized by the State Board of Agriculture year after year. Our delegate has been here and I do not see why we </seg>
            <seg id="p012">12 should be set back in the corner. Of course I will leave it to tha State Board of Agriculture. Sass: I move the Secretary read the letter. Ollis: The Secretary will read the letter Hunter has handed in. O'Neill, Nebr.. January 17, 1916. State of Nebraska, , .. „... '- 88. County of Holt \ tl, P. C. Kelley, County Clerk of Holt County. Nebraska, do hereby Ify that at the regular meeting of the County Board of Supervisors of I County, Nebraska, held at the supervisors' office at O'Neill, in said lty on the 17th day of January, A. D. 1916, a resolution was adopted cting the County Clerk of Holt County, to issue a warrant on the nty General Fund of Holt County, to J. M. Hunter, President of the I County Pair Association for $853.50 in compliance with Section 6 of pter 1 of the Revised Statutes of Nebraska, for the year 1913. L Witness my hand and the seal of Holt County this 17th day of lary, A. D. 1916. P. C. KELLEY. (SEAL) County Clerk. k Mellon 1 will also state, while I am on my feet, it is a fact that r to recognition by the county board the State Board of Agriculture always recognized the South Fork Fair Association at Chambers and ' have been here almost constantly, year after year. t Ollis: The motion is that the credential committee's report be aded so as to give Mr. Hunter the full vote and cut out the Chambers elation. Lawrence: I would like to ask for information, if that has gone through the courts, what the decision was in regard to the money being issued to the proper parties; it seems to me that is a question that would cut some figure in this vote. I know nothing about it myself, and conditions up there, but there are two questions that might arise as to whether the county commissioners issued the money to the proper au - thorities. If there is a decision by the courts I would like to know who the courts recognized as the proper fair association. Ollis: Can anyone answer that question? Grimes: I can answer this, gentlemen. We had a suit in the District Court a year ago on this matter and the judge there decided in favor of the Holt County fair but we have carried it to the Supreme Court and there has been no decision. The suit has not been decided in the District Court for 1915, and I do not think Holt County has drawn the money for the last three years, although the supervisors have allowed it. Ollis: Any further remarks? Hunter: I do not want to consume a lot of time. The case was tried a year ago before Judge Westover and, if you will remember, I </seg>
            <seg id="p013">13 PROCEEDINGS NEBBA8KA 8TATE BOARD Or AGBICULTUKE handed in the findings of the court last year. In Judge Westover's de - cision he stated the Holt County Fair Association had gone strictly accord - ing to law and had complied with the law in every respect and that the other association, while they had been drawing the money from a legal standpoint, had not been entitled to it and it was a serious question whether they could not be made to refund the money, but as he was living at O'Neill he did not feel like rendering a decision and an appeal was taken to the Supreme Court but the appeal was not taken in time to stop the payment of the money. While our friends from Chambers were anxious to have this tried out, and we were perfectly willing they should, they did not seem to have confidence enough in their opinion to file a bond and stop us from getting the money. Last year the claim was allowed which we were entitled to after we filed our report but was not allowed until after the levy was made which was a little late. An appeal was taken from the action of the county board by the South Fork Fair Asso - ciation and the case was not tried until last week. Judge Welsh tried this case and he has not rendered a decision; he said inasmuch as it had been decided by one judge and the case was in the Supreme Court now that he should take a little more time to look up the matter more thoroughly. Our general fund is included in it and they have allowed the Holt County Fair Association the money for this year. The county board is practically unanimous on this subject except one member, who represents the Chambers district. We have seven members. Danielson: Don't these fairs make a report to you, Mr. Secretary? Mellor: Yes. Member: It wodld seem someone should offer a vote of substitution to accept all the report, but the case in question, leaving it open to be brought up in the future. There should be a motion by someone who can make a motion at this time and bring it before this body and then all will have to vote. Whitehead: I think the suggestion is well taken and I would make a motion that the credential committee report be accepted with the exception of the Holt County delegation. 0111b: You make that as an amendment? Whitehead: A substitute motion. Ollis: Do I hear a second? Member: I will second it to get it before the house. Ollis: You have heard the substitute motion that the report of the committee be accepted except with relation to Holt County; that would leave the question before the committee as it was before. Any further remarks? All in favor of the question signify by saying aye; contrary minded no. The report is accepted, except the Holt County proposition, and that is still left with the committee. Whitehead: I presume that now will be left to the people who are seated here as regular delegates to decide. The Credential Committee </seg>
            <seg id="p014">14 PROCEEDINGS N EBB ASK A STATE BOABD OF AGBICULTUBE E reported this and there seems to be a controversy in regard to Holt ity. It is up to this association to seat either one or both, as they deem proper. tOUis: That can be brought before this body by a proper motion, unless there is a motion of that kind made it will be left to the mittee. Whitehead: It is simply a question of whether we will accept the recommendation of the committee. All is accepted but that Then it might be proper to make a motion as to who shall sit here as a delegate. I will make a motion that each of these parties be allowed a half vote in this convention, for the sake of bringing this before the meeting. Ollis: Do I hear a second? Seconded. Agee: As a substitute for that motion I move the gentleman from O'Neill, who is recognized from Holt County, be allowed to rote in this convention. Ollis: Do I hear a second? Seconded. It is moved and seconded to substitute a motion allowing Mr. Hunter one full vote in this convention. Agee: The commissioners have passed upon this question and Mr. Hunter has the credentials to represent his society, they know more about it than I do and I believe we should leave it to Holt County. W' itehead: This seems to be the situation in the case. There has been a decision in the District Court of Holt County in favor of Mr. Hunter's association. There is an appeal taken from that decision to the Supreme Court of the State of Nebraska, on file now. That would leave the question undecided as to who the proper authorities are until it is decided by the Supreme Court of the state and until this Is done we are unable to pass intelligently on the question. For that reason I am in favor, for the sake of harmony and peace, of seating both of the delegates at this time. By next year the question will be settled. Ollis: Any further remarks? Danlelson: It Just appealed to me, if you seat these gentlemen with a half vote apiece, what are you going to do tomorrow morning when voting for the members of the State Board of Agriculture. Will they write one-half vote before the names of the men for whom they vote, instead of a cross? Ollis: I do not think that would stand &lt;n the way of the merit in deciding one way or the other. Graff: I feel somewhat like I want to take the part of the under dog, especially when that under dog is one who has carried on an agricultural organization in that county for a great many years. Unfortunately, the citizens further north have wakened up along these lines and have or - ganized a county agricultural society which has been recognized by the county board and has drawn first blood in the courts; since these two </seg>
            <seg id="p015">PROCEEDINGS XtMASKA STATE BOAKD OF AGBICULTUIE 15 agricultural societies are represented here today and we gave them repre - sentation last year, I feel I would not like to send this young mai. home without giving him a little voice in this annual meeting. I hope that the courts and the people of Holt County and everybody concerned in this controversy will know exactly where they are another year and then this society will know what is to be done. The chances are there would not be dual representation here another year. I am in favor of giving both of these organizations the same representation we gave them last year. (Applause.) Agee: I have this much more to say in reply to our friend Graff; there is no reason in the world why Hunter should be robbed of half a vote. He is the legal representative of that county, if we have anything to give, let us give it to him, but let us give Hunter what he is entitled to. My sympathies are with the fellow who is off in the wilds and away from the railroad, but Mr. Hunter is the representative of the Holt County association. Why should we rob him of half a vote, when the county commissioners and the courts have rendered their decision in his favor. Do not take something away from Hunter and give it to somebody else. Hunter: I Just wanted to say I heartily agree with Mr. Graff; I do not want to do anything to Chambers, particularly with my friend Grimes here, and send him home in a humiliated position. I guess I told you last year we are friends, and we are friends, and hope we will be. I agreed with Graff, and he was chairman of the Credential Committee last year. If you will give me what I am entitled to I am not going to try to cut Mr. Grimes out of this convention at all; do not understand that I am, but I feel I am the legal representative of that county, the courts and the board of supervisors have recognized me, and it was almost unanimous. Whitehead: If I understand the proposition by the gentleman who has just spoken, that would give Holt County two votes in the convention. As I understand the law, the president of each agricultural society who represents the county would be entitled to one vote and it does not seem to me to be right to the other counties here that one county should have two votes and the rest only one. For that reason it seems the half vote each or one full vote for Holt County is all they are entitled to. The prime object of this association does not seem to me to be the seating of this aggregation, but( it is the agricultural Interests of the state at large. If they can have two associations there so much the better for the county, and can hold two fairs, but so far as the state at large is concerned they should only have one vote from Holt County. Ollis: A substitute motion allowing Hunter the full vote; all in favor signify by saying aye, contrary minded no. (Calls for rising vote). AH in favor please rise. Member: Calls for roll call. Ollis : Do you demand the roll call Mellor: We can settle it by rising if you withdraw the motion. </seg>
            <seg id="p016">16 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOABO OF A8BICULTCM: Member: I withdraw the motion. 0111b: All In favor of the motion please rise and remain standing until counted. Strader: May I ask a question before this vote is taken? Is there anything in the by-laws to prevent our giving the man from South Pork rote? Mellor: The statute! say one vote. The vote on the motion was fifteen affirmative. Motion declared lost. Ollis: The motion before the house now is to adopt the report ot the committee so far as it concerns the Holt County fairs. All in favor of the adoption of the report will signify by saying aye. The report of the committee is declared adopted. Ollis: As I stated to you a few moments ago our President, Mr. Roberts, is not able to be with us but he has sent in his annual report and the Secretary will now read the same. PRESIDENT'S REPORT Fellow Members of the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture In reviewing our State Fair business for 1915 the officers and mem - bers can well feel proud of its success in every way. We started to prepare for the 1915 Fair with a depleted treasury, due to the rainy week of 1914. We had been prepared from year to year by carrying a reserve fund of ten thousand dollars to meet such conditions, and if we had not paid out of that fund eight thousand dollars to com - plete the new Agricultural Hall we would still have had a surplus left in the treasury. However, members of the Board of Managers were not discouraged, and, having confidence that a year with favorable weather would adjust things, they borrowed two thousand dollars and gave their notes for same; as was done several years ago, and no doubt are willing to do it again should it become necessary. The exhibits in all departments was above the average of any fair ever held in Nebraska. The Cattle exhibit under the supervision of Superintendent E. R. Danielson made a splendid showing, all barns were full and overflow space had to be provided. Both exhibitors and patrons spoke highly of this department and the manner in which It was conducted. The Swine exhibit also maintained its usual standard of excellence, 1915 hogs shown. We regret very much that better quarters could not have been pro - vided for the men who work so hard and take such interest in this great industry in Nebraska, and I sincerely hope that better accommodations will be provided in the near future. </seg>
            <seg id="p017">PROCEEDINGS NEBBA8KA STATE BO ABO OF AORICCLTUBI 17 Our sheep department is increasing in quantity and quality each year, and this industry should be given every attention and encouragement possible, (or I believe this to be one of the best adjuncts to the (arm financially, and as a weed exterminator. The exhibit of horses, although not so large as some years, was excep - tionally good as to quality; about one hundred and fifty contended for the premiums offered, not including the eighty Shetland ponies, which were especially fine. The exhibit in Agricultural Hall, compared with other states, is in a class by itself; and that fact is conceded by visitors from other Fairs. This year was especially favorable for the excellent showing from our western counties on account of abundance of rain, and they certainly demonstrated what can be produced in those counties under favorable conditions. The Horticultural exhibit was much larger than any previous year — something like six thousand plates of fruit and one hundred seventy-five varieties of apples. Much credit is due Mr. J. R. Duncan, Mr. Christy, Mr. Pollard and their coworkers for this splendid show. The Educational exhibit on the second floor of this building has grown from year to year until several hundred feet of space is required to make this exhibit. Those in charge are to be congratulated in the progress they are making. Superintendents of both city and county schools are joining forces and are beginning to realize the educational advantages of our State Pair. Many schools decided to wait until after our Fair before opening, so as to give both teachers and pupils an opportunity to attend, and we believe there is no other place where students can inform themselves as to the agricultural resources of our Great State better than in a week at our Fair. We appreciate the cooperation of the professors from our State University in giving demonstrations and lectures on the best means of producing and getting results in almost every line of agriculture. In the better babies contest, while reduced In numbers from former years, the interest shown is as strong as ever, both by patrons and those in charge. Machinery Hall can now be called Automobile Building, space used almost exclusively for that exhibit; and the crowds that thronged this building during the Fair is an indication of the interest .taken in this up-to-date mode of travel. Orders were taken, so exhibitors told me, that exceeded their expectations. Much interest was taken as usual in the machinery department, many firms represented for the first time, and I believe they realize the importance of making an exhibit at our Fair, as in no other way can they present their goods before their patrons in the same length of time at so little expense. We appreciate the fact that they are a great (actor In the success of our Fair and every encouragement should be given them. </seg>
            <seg id="p018">18 PROCEEDINGS IfEBBASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE EThe Fish exhibit, which is always attractive, created the same inter - as in former years, and Mr. O'Brian is ready at all times to do his in making the Fair a success. tThe Poultry department is always looked after by the breeders gen - ly, realizing that this branch of agriculture brings good returns to fanner. t Under the efficient management of F. G. Odell the honey display leded anything of the kind ever known at our Fair, and we certainly grateful to him for his efforts. The old Dairy building occupied by the Farmers Union, was a busy place, being headquarters for thousands of farmers who attended our Fair, and we must concede the farmer to be the leading factor in our state, and on him depends largely our success. k Mercantile Hall, in charge of Mr. Ringer, who represented the manu - ires of Nebraska, deserves much praise. This was the first display tie kind ever made on our grounds, and it was surprising to know many different articles are manufactured in Nebraska. All seemed to be well pleased with results and intend to be with us another year. I believe I am safe in saying that our attractions and amusements were beyond criticism and so far as I know the public was well pleased with the selections made for their pleasure and enjoyment. Auto racing was added to our attractions for the first time, and from the interest taken, this feature has come to stay. Mr. Sloan, who managed this part of our program, had nothing but words of praise at Chicago from all fair officials who secured his services. We have made some improvements this year. New sleeping com - partments were built for the boys' camp, which were much needed and appreciated by them. The low ground below the swine barns has been partially filled, and when completed will greatly benefit that part of grounds. Some of the buildings were repainted which always adds to their beauty and appearance as well as being a necessary protection. This part of the work should not be neglected. I would recommend that fill on low ground be completed and dirt taken from railroad right-of-way, which now obstructs view of our grounds from passing train, if same can be secured. Some cleaning up or tearing down at rear of concession buildings as you enter grounds by the B. &amp; M. R. R. or street cars. Also new sidewalks from street car gates east to main street. Advertising I want to especially thank the press of this state for their united efforts for the success of our 1915 Fair. Never before have the great dailies and weeklies joined hands in giving the State Fair such publicity, and I heartily accord to them their share of the credit of making the 1915 Fair the greatest in its history. And while they are so loyal, the State Fair officials must see that their part of the advertisement is taken </seg>
            <seg id="p019">19 rmx KKIHNCS NKKKVSKA STATK BOAK1) OF ARRK'l'LTl'BE care of. My idea of advertising done by the State Fair itself, is to give the patrons value received for their money. Give them more than you advertise rather than cut anything short. Have all attractions and amusements pleasing for both young and old, but clean, so that every - one leaving our gates will feel it is worth the price. You will then have from one to two hundred thousand walking advertisers scattered all over the state ready to come back the next year. I attended some of the county fairs which were a great credit to the different counties as well as the officials in charge. Co-operation be - tween county and state fairs is essential for the success of both. Certain rules that state fairs have I believe would be an advantage to county fairs. One especially, where an exhibitor does not comply with rules, he be suspended until a hearing before a Board of Appeals, after which he could be reinstated by paying fine, apology, or as in their Judgment seemed proper, otherwise prohibited from showing in any county or state fair. Our trip to Chicago as delegates to the National Fairs Association was both pleasant and profitable. Many instructive papers were read. The discussion on these bringing out many points well worth the con - sideration of state fair managers. There are some things however that do not appeal to us as a good thing for state fairs to adopt. A certain professor thought we ought to take lessons from European countries in conducting our fairs. He said in our judging pavilion, spectators could scarcely tell the color of animals shown from their seats, and that in the old countries you saw the animals one day on foot, the next day their dressed carcass hanging in the same stall for your inspection. I cannot see how it would be possible for six to ten thousand people, the seating capacity of Iowa or Nebraska stock pavilion to see anything if allowed in the ring at time of judging, and should we adopt the system of slaughtering animals with the temperature from eighty to ninety, also some flies, our exhibitors would strenously object to that method and prefer to keep their show cattle at home. I also wonder what Nebraska would do for show cattle if all were slaughtered at Iowa Fair. So we find peculiar ideas even among professors. Those desiring to see the different beef breeds both before and after dressing should go to the slaughter houses, or some experiment station where demonstrations are made for that purpose. It is true in England cattle are not generally sold to the butcher or dealer to be shipped at so much per pound live weight, but are sold per pound dressed, an Inspector looks after the seller's interest. But this method could not well be adopted in this country where so many cattle are fed for market. I for one do not desire to adopt England's plan of running fairs. I had the privilege of attending the Royal Cornwall Fair five years ago. The first days of the fair were for royalty and some of the middle class, admission high on those days so the poor class could not afford to go The last days prices reduced one-half so the poor could attend. If the object had been to help the poor instead of dividing classes it might be all right, but I </seg>
            <seg id="p020">20 could but notice how busy officials were entertaining visitors the first days, and the last days very conspicuous by their absence. No good American wants to make that change in the Nebraska State Fair. I should like to impress on members the necessity of co-operation and harmony in the future as you have shown in the past. There are those who are watching every opportunity to sow dissension among members no matter how clean and successful a fair you hold and you may be assured that anyone trying to array members against each other are not In sympathy with our Fair but do so from selfish motives. In retiring from the presidency, I want to thank every member for his loyal efforts, working with me to maintain and build up one of the greatest fairs in the United States and 1 assure you that when ever the time comes that I do not work with you on the inside, I shall always be a booster and friend to our State Fair. Respectfully submitted, JOSEPH ROBERTS, President. Ollis: We will now take up the matter of nominations for members of the Board who are to be elected for the ensuing two years. In the first district three men are to be elected for two years and one man for one year. As Mr. Mellor stated to you in the reading of the call, for the meeting, there is a vacancy to be filled in the first district; one man for one year, three men for two years. If you will make your recommenda - tions we will write them on the board so they can all see them. James: Do I understand there are three members to be elected for years? Mellor: The terms of Arnold, Foster and Banning expire. S trader was appointed to fill the term for which Mr. Rudge was elected. James: I nominate Mr. William Foster Jackson: I wish to place in nomination Mr. V.

If not, we will take up the second district. bAgee: I do not know what your rules are, but it seems to me there &gt;ld be three nominations for the long term and one for the short i. I think they should be separated. Danielson: The three highest men take the long term, that has been our custom. Ollis: The three men receiving the highest vote have the long terms and the one receiving the smallest vote the short term. Of course If you care to change that and have certain nominations for the long term and certain for the short term it can be done. </seg>

There should be a certain named (or the long term and a certain number for the short term and then we will know who we are voting for. I move you we separate those in the short term from those in the long term and in all other instances so we will know just exactly for whom we are voting. Ollis: I think the only way we can get out of this is to withdraw these nominations and then proceed to make nominations for a long term and for a short term. Agee: I think that is fair. Leftwich: It seems to me that will complicate matters; it has been our custom to make those receiving the highest number of votes the long term candidates and those receiving the lower number the short term candidates. Ollis: I do not hear any second to the motion. If not, we will proceed to the second district. Whitehead: There is this difficulty that will arise Cheney: I rise to a point of order; there is no question before the house. Ollis: Your point is well taken. Let us proceed to the second district.

Ollis: That would have been the time but we will deviate from the rules a little and allow you to give your reasons if you care to. It probably will not take very long. Lawrence: It is not a set speech and will only take a few moments; very frequently in the past few years since I have been located in the western part of the state I have found the people in the eastern part of the state do not seem to recognize that there is such a place as the western part of Nebraska. If you will bear with me a few moments and keep in mind the state lines of Nebraska and draw a line from the top edge of Colorado and move that over to the western edge of Custer county and extend that line practically due north you have a rectangular piece of Nebraska which at the present time is represented by one man, E. Von Porell of Scottsbluff county. I have not met the man, I think he is a pretty good sized fellow and I think he is well able to represent that part of the state so far as he is concerned but you are not permitting enough membership from that end of the stale because we feel, this year at least, we have made a pretty good record. We would ask you in choosing your man for the Board to look at this proposition: there you have a section of the state, practically an area of one-third of the state of Nebraska, represented by one man. You speak of the sixth district being represented by five men but you take them from the eastern quarter and forget about the western part of the state, in the sandhills. Let me quote you a few statistics. You know the Trade Review Mr. Bushnell gets out; he mentions eight principle crops of the state of Nebraska, there were five leading counties under each head. That made forty banner counties in the state. Do you realize the western end of the state was named nine times out of the forty, more than one-fourth? Also do you know that Mr. Bushnell rigged up a column of fancy yields of the western part of the state; there were thirty -two mentions made and out of those thirty-two thirteen came from the eleven counties in the western part of the state. I am not posted as to the eleven counties </seg>

As to the gentlemen who are nominated here this afternoon of course there is some question as to who I shall vote for, I do not know the men, all I know is they have served on the Board and have been very satisfactory. I have brought before you today a man from the western part of the state, from the same section Uncle Charley Mann represented, who has been recognized as being willing and able to serve the western end of the state, and we ask you in making up your ballots — you remember that one third of the state of Nebraska has one representative and it should have more. Ollis: We will now have the secretary's report. Mellor: Before leaving this matter I ask it be re-opened again as I have a letter on my desk, which I have forgotten, and hope you will allow the name of J. P. Jensen of Blair, Nebraska, to be placed in nomination. Mellor: If there is no objection I think it would be a courtesy to allow this man's name to be placed on the ballot. Sass: I move J. P. Jensen's name be placed on the list. Motion carried SECRETARY'S REPORT To the Officers and Members of the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture, Greeting: As the most important business of the State Board of Agriculture is the conducting of the State Pair, we will commence with that subject. Professor W. J. Kennedy, formerly of Ames, Iowa, who judged all the cattle and horses at the 1901 Nebraska State Pair, is authority for the statement that "the Nebraska State Pair has made more rapid progress during the past ten years than any large fair in the United States." Such statements has caused us to investigate, to see what are the actual facts and we have taken the period of the last five years as against the period 1901 to 1905 inclusive, being the five years preceding the ten year period spoken of. We find as follows: fear 901 902 903 .904 1905 Total receipts $ 28,370.63 . 35,546.82 . 42,301.81 . 42,297.16 40,784.85 Gates $ 12,522.50 22,799.00 26,090.50 26,544.25 25,944.75 Amphi- theatre $ 2,196.50 2,759.00 4,446.50 4,667.75 3,321.75 Concessions $ 2,063.05 2,302.41 4,082.41 4,177.57 5,204.80 Speed $ 1,046.45 2,005.75 2,577.40 1,654.75 1,291.90 Total . .$189,301.27 $113,901.00 $17,391.50 $17,830.24 $ 8,493.54 </seg>
            <seg id="p024">24 PBocBBMea rwm' rats boabd of aobicultube Taking the receipts of the first five years mentioned as one hundred per cent, the comparison with the last five years shows increase in total receipts 235 per cent; gates 208 per cent; amphitheatre and quarter stretch 384 per cent; concessions 404 per cent; and speed 183 per cent, or a total increase in these items of 144 per cent more than the amounts received in the corresponding five year period submitted. If such is a fact we, as an organization, are facing a large problem for its continued success in the future. We are especially blessed by - natural advantages of location in the heart of the best agricultural country on the face of the earth. Therefore, our prosperity is due to the natural conditions reflected by the possibilities of our patrons for success. That the season just passed, although unusual with regard to excessive mois - ture, has been one of agricultural plenty is fully proven by the record breaking attendance enjoyed by the 1915 Nebraska State Pair, to-wii. 180,713. tThe Nebraska State Fair grounds now consists of 183 acres of land which is erected 98 buildings belonging to the state.

Resume 1915 Fair It is proper that we give a brief resume of the 1915 Fair; therefore we will do so — making it as short as possible. Horae* The agricultural department of the Government gives Nebraska the sixth position in the United States in the number of horses within the state and the largest per capita of any state in the Union according to rural population — to wit, 1.19. That Nebraska, with her wonderful re - sources in the raising of feed and forage and climatic conditions, is the natural breeding ground for horses cannot be disputed. Therefore it is rather disappointing that we do not have a greater show in this particular department as it is an undeniable fact that a number of fairs have a far better show than Nebraska. The number of entries at our 1915 Fair in this department were 434; the amount of premiums offered was $2,586.50 of which we paid out $1,700.00. </seg>
            <seg id="p026">26 FBOCnSIHOS ROU1K1 STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Cattle According to population, Nebraska is given credit for more cattle per capita than any other state in the Union. Therefore, it is a fore - gone conclusion that our cattle show should be one of the best in the United States. The show for 1915 was one of the best, as to quality, ever held in Nebraska, being assisted by the prospect of the Panama Pacific Exposition which, at the time of our Fair, was the goal of nearly all of the older exhibitors. This condition, however, failed to materialise aa the Panama Pacific people called off the possibility for showing at San Francisco by any exhibitor who had shown east of the Rocky Moun - tains. Animals making up the dairy exhibit were mostly shown by Nebraska breeders — therefore, to we Nebraskans, it was especially inter - esting. One of our greatest needs is a new, modern, sanitary combined dairy barn and exhibit room. We are not in favor of a temporary make - shift but do think this industry should be recognized by the state, by the erection of such a building as quickly as possible. entries in the cattle department were 1.424; the amount offered tO.OO and the amomnt paid out $6,791.00. Swine Nebraska, one of the best swine producing states in the Union, held a marvelous swine show at the 1915 State Fair, the peculiarity fng 1915 hogs — corresponding exactly with the year in which it was d. In this department were shown some of the choicest individuals t have ever been seen in the United States. There was offered $3,907.00 which $2,878.00 was paid in premiums. Sheep We are gradually gaining in our sheep exhibit. Only a few years ago there were scarcely any sheep shown at the Nebraska State Fair; this year we had 401 entries on which we offerd $1,254.00 and paid out $1,081.00. Poultry The poultry show has grown to such dimensions that it is necessary for the Board to either restrict the showing made by some exhibitors or provide more commodious quarters. We think we are warranted in making the statement that the Nebraska poultry show is one of the greatest held in the United States. It now fills both the old and new poultry buildings to capacity. To make this a more creditable showing, uniform coops are a necessity and we hope tt will be possible for the incoming Board to see their way clear to make this much needed im - provement. About 3,000 birds were on exhibit. Our offering in this department waa $3,445.00, of which $1,144.50 was paid. </seg>
            <seg id="p027">27 r»H EEDI.NGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Agriculture Our exhibit of agriculture continues to be the marvel of all foreign visitors. Nebraska has a trained corps of efficient exhibitors in this particular department that is not equalled in any other state in the Union and, naturally, this department is one of great pride to this Board. We realize that to build a creditable agricultural exhibit much time and expense are necessary. Our suggestion to each member here is to lend every assistance to those who are striving to make such a display in the name of your county. Talk to the county commissioners, the banks and real estate men, to secure for the exhibitor a county appropri - ation. Have you considered how much good you can do by some effort along this line? Get busy. Nebraska must keep her position at the head of the procession in exhibits of agriculture. The artistic features shown by the combination of agriculture, horticulture and floriculture on the lower floor of the building are of great merit. In this department we offered the sum of $4,631.42 of which we paid out $4,538.92. Horticulture and Floriculture The peculiar method of arrangement adopted by the managers of the horticultural and fioricultural departments has created considerable satisfaction both to the management and patrons by its unusual and beautiful display. In this department was offered $1,200.00 and this amount was paid out. Dairy This Board feels deeply greatful to the members of the State Dairy - men's Association, who annually assist in making the dairy show one of the most interesting and growing departments on the State Fair grounds. During the past two years the association has made extra effort to draw the attention of the patrons to the excellence of their exhibit. Owing to the generosity of the individuals who are members of this association the expense in this department is almost nothing as only $197.00 was asked for premiums, of which $127.00 was paid. Domestic Products One of the departments making the most rapid growth in the last few years is that of our domestic products. The ladles of the state seem to take an especial interest in showing their skill in the prepara - tion of various makes of bread and cake, canned fruits and vegetables for exhibition, which later are so much appreciated by the men and children in the family. This department is fully two or three times greater than it was five years ago. The number of entries this year was 1,825; the offering for premiums was $393.75 nd the payment of premiums $366.25. </seg>

It was by far the best exhibit ir held on the Nebraska State Fair grounds and much credit is due the exhibitors who participated. The amount offered in this depart - nt was $418.00. all of which was paid out. Women's Department. A few years ago, when we moved the women's department to the old e stock building, it was thought that we had provided sufficient space r this exhibit for many years to come. The space for exhibit purposes n this building is now entirely inadequate for the items offered. The umber of entries in the textile department at the last Fair was 1,922, any of them being put in such out-of-the-way places and under such nditions it was impossible to do justice to some of the finest work ere. If this department could have a series of show cases made, in lich to exhibit at close range the splendid work offered, I am sure it ould be appreciated greatly by the ladies interested. The amount of premiums offered was $565.00, of which $490.50 was paid. Fine Arts Those who are interested in fine arts say we get better work each year and it is a fact that the number of exhibitors from out over the state is steadily increasing. The same conditions exist in the art depart - ment that have been mentioned in the women's department — that is show cases could be used to good advantage. The number of entries was 708: the amount offered was $660.00 and the amount paid $454.75. Educational The educational department, located in the south balcony of the Eiat agriculture-horticulture hall, is without doubt the greatest display public school work to be seen at any fair in the United States. The libit for 1916 covered more than nine thousand square feet of space I was a recommendation for the faithful work of the superintendent and the educational department of the state of Nebraska. The amount of premiums offered was $662.00, of which $479.00 was paid. Better Babies The babies' health department has grown to be one of the standard departments of the Fair. The interest manifested by the mothers in the welfare of their children gives great pleasure to the members of this Board. We have divided this department into practically two classes — rural and city. In the rural class 55 babies were examined and in the </seg>
            <seg id="p029">29 raOCEBDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BUAJtU OF AGBICULTUBE city class 128 examined, the total number being restricted to two hundred. The amount offered was $304.00 all of which was paid out. During the last two years we have conducted a children's nursery under the north balcony of agriculture-horticulture building, where chil - dren were cared for under direction of competent nurses during the days of the Fair. This year one of the state institutions furnished the nurses free of charge to the Board. A small fee is charged parents for the care received. We believe, with a proper amount of publicity, and capable management, this department could be made profitable. It is a source of great convenience and help to mothers attending the Fair and its possibilities are worthy of consideration. Boyi' Camp The Boy's Camp continues to attract in the neighborhood of one hundred members. During the year we have erected eight roofed and floored tents for the boys' sleeping apartments, one similar tent for the superintendent and it is hoped that we can provide a lecture building in the near future so as to relieve the present dining room from double duty, which is claimed to be inconvenient by those in charge. This department is beginning to be one of our best advertising mediums. Boys from fifteen to twenty-one years of age in attendance are provided with an impressive short course in scientific agriculture from lectures and object lessons, and acquire added confidence from ushering in the grandstand and a general good fellowship from atheletic and camp fire experiences with the camp leaders and other boys. Our 1916 calendar contains a copy of a photograph of our 1915 Boys' Camp, which should tend toward an increased attendance for next year. We hope each county in the state will see that a full quota of delegates is sent down this year. It is the unanimous opinion of each boy who attended that it was a week of profit and pleasure. Automobiles The automobile exhibit at our annual Fair is always the greatest show of its kind in the state. More machines were on exhibit here this year than were shown at the great Iowa 1915 Fair. The exhibitors are beginning to realize that at the Nebraska State Fair they get in touch with actual buyers as at no other state gathering and as fast as it is possible for us to improve showing facilities we expect to see this department grow to be one of the greatest at future fairs. Machinery Some of the great machine companies returned to the showing fold at the last Fair and we expect soon to see them all in their accustomed place. There is no proof that State Fair showing is not profitable to the exhibitor, in fact, all testimony in the case shows that it is profitable. </seg>
            <seg id="p030">30 PSOCEIDINOS NEBBA8KA STATE BOARD Or AQBICULTUBE One instance brought to the notice of a manager of one of the leading western machinery firms was as follows: A patron at the 1913 State Pair saw a binder which he concluded was suitable for his needs. When he went home he visited the implement dealer of his town and asked him if he was going to handle that particular machine the coming season. The dealer said he did not think he would, but after a heart to heart talk he promised to secure one for his customer. In the spring when the machine arrived and was set up others began to look it over and the final result was eighteen binders of that particular make sold from that one man attending the State Fair. The western managers realize the necessity for showing but the eastern "higher ups" are conservative. Too many farmers attend the Nebraska State Fair to be long ignored. It has been such actions on the part of the large dealers that have assisted in giving our farmers a just cause for the movement toward organization to compete with powerful business combines as shown by the machinery combination in this effort to deprive our rural patrons of an opportunity to see new models and improvements in machinery. Mercantile We are indebted to the Nebraska Manufacturers' Association and their efficient secretary, Mr. Frank I. Ringer, for the best exhibit of Nebraska made goods ever shown in the state. This exhibit entirely filled the 13,800 square feet in Mercantile Hall and was an outstanding credit to a rapidly growing industry. All foreign exhibits in the mercan - tile line were placed in the Dairy and Food building. From the comments of the thousands of patrons who saw the wonder - ful mercantile and manufacturers' show in these two buildings, we know they were deeply appreciated. Farmers' Co-operative Union This young giant of an organization of farmers only, applied for and were located in the old Dairy building where headquarters were main - tained. Their exhibit and rest room entirely filled this great building where the local branch had the pleasure of entertaining the officers and delegates of the National organization. University The University of Nebraska is to be congratulated on the effort being made to give publicity to their activities. Many patrons visited our office and commented on the completeness of data secured at the University exhibit and they surely have a more extended view of Nebraska's greatest educational institution, by being permitted to hear the explanation of conclusions arrived at from long periods of scientific investigation. This exhibit covered 6,040 feet of floor space and as high on the walls as could readily be seen. </seg>
            <seg id="p031">31 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Fish Exhibit The Fish and Game Commission, under the superintendency of W. J. O'Brien, made their usual interesting exhibit consisting from tiny gold fish up to the hundred pound river catfish. This exhibit la one of the popular ones which always draws an immense crowd of people and it is safe to say that more than 100,000 visitors were entertained thereby. Inatitutiona The fifteen state institutions under the Board of Control made a splendid showing, in old agricultural hall, of the handicraft of their inmates which was a credit to the state. Such an exhibit of excellent work proves conclusively that the management Is concerned in the welfare and happiness of the state's unfortunates. Our thanks are ex - tended to Messrs. Kennedy, Gerdes and Holcomb for the interest taken in an effort to show the people of the state that their wards are urged on to better things. Permanent Improvements The permanent improvements for 1915 were rather limited as no funds were in the treasury for such purpose. We think, however, that the following may be mentioned; nine Boys' Camp tent buildings, fill of old Antelope Creek, and the purchase of tbe John Deere building, at a total expenditure of about $1,500.00. Borrowed Money On account of bad weather during the two previous Fairs, early in the spring we ran out of money so it was necessary for the Board of Managers to individually guarantee a loan of $2,000.00 for the purpose of bringing us up to the Fair. This loan was paid on Wednesday of the Fair. Concessionaires One of the barometers of our success or failure is indicated by the results from the concession department. We notice many of the same faces in this department year after year. This fact did not obtain several years ago. The parties who follow the large fairs for business reasons are seeking a foothold at Nebraska, which is an indication that outside concessionaires now recognize Nebraska as one of the desirable fairs to attend. Toilets The Fair grounds are satisfactorily equipped with toilets if we had water sufficient to properly flush them. It seems impossible for us to secure pressure from the city mains when the peak load obtains, therefore it would be well to consider the erection of large tanks on the northeast corner of Art and Textile building to care for the necessities of that building and Agriculture-Horticulture building, and at the grandstand </seg>
            <seg id="p032">32 PBfXEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOASO OF AGRICULTURE / to properly care for toilets there. We think if these two points were provided for, that the pressure of the mains might be sufficient to care for the others. Superintendent* A large, well balanced fair can only be secured by active, working superintendents. When the department superintendent busies himself in « effort to build up his department, in addition to what is done from office, It shows in the excellence of that particular class at the Fair. It has been our policy, when the possible weakness of a department is brought to our attention prior to the Fair, to write letters to interested parties in an effort to build up the weak spots. Some departments, however, need nothing additional to the usual advertising as the superintendent is concerned in its welfare and has it well in hand so that before the Fair opens he knows about what kind of an exhibit he will have. That Nebraska is blessed with a "live bunch" of superintendents is reflected in the growth of the Fair. Chicago Meeting* Our delegates attending the annual meetings of the various societies held in Chicago the first week in December were Messrs. Roberts, Ollis, Jackson, Graff, Myers and your secretary. A number of the breeders' associations have already notified the office of the special premiums appropriated for our 1916 Fair. The dates secured follow Iowa and are September 4th to 9th. Attractions Our big attraction for 1915, outside of horse and automobile racing, was flying by De Lloyd Thompson and auto driving by Barney Oldfield. These parties gave a special aeroplane-auto race each day, which proved a novelty. This Thompson-Oldfield exhibition was secured as a com - bined attraction and greatly appreciated by our patrons, together with the smaller vaudeville acts used to fill in the afternoon and evening program. It is our opinion that another step forward could be taken by an evening program wholly different and apart from that shown in the afternoon. This could be accomplished by careful consideration but would, of necessity, add to the expense. Horse Racing The modern state fair seeks to instruct and entertain its patrons; its principal aim is to educate. Many times we hear objections to racing or other entertainment features, but so many things are provided at a great state fair to satisfy the tastes of all that it is unnecessary to com - ment thereon. </seg>
            <seg id="p033">1'HCM-KEUIMiS NKMANKA STATK IMtAKIl OK AUBK'l'I.TUBE 33 It is true that many people attend the state (air and are so interested in the meritorious exhibits that they have no time (or the entertain - ment features but, on the other hand, there is a certain class of our patrons who come just in time to go to the grandstand (or the racing and attractions only. To this latter class the racing program is the all im - portant part of the state (air, in (act it was the only great entertaining event o( the (air no more than ten years ago. Now the aeroplane and automobile detract somewhat from its monoply. However, tne speed exhibited by a well trained horse in a contest with his peers brings the red blood tingling through the veins of horse lovers — and they are legion. That this assertion is true might have been fully authenticated during the 1915 Nebraska State Fair, when the immense grandstand, which seats 6,400 people, and the bleachers were filled to capacity and the (ence around the entire track was crowded with spectators. Some people say that the races are "fixed in the barns." We do not think such assertion is based on (act. We do know that the aim o( this Board, during our connection with it, has been to secure officials in all the departments of racing whose integrity is unquestioned and who demand the best (rom those under their control. In 1915 we gave four - teen harness races and eight running races in the (our days, (or which we offered $10,650 00 and finally paid out the sum o( $7,848.40. We had 344 entries in this department. Automobile Racing Prjor to the year 1903 automobile racing was heard of only as between Henry Ford's wonderful "999" racing car and Alexander Winton with his two (amous "Bullet" creations. During the year mentioned the Packard Motor Car Company built the racer "Gray Wol(" and the Peerless company o( Cleveland the "Green Dragon." The first international dirt track contest was held in 1904 over the Empire City track, New York, in which Barney Oldfield participated as driver of the Peerless company's "Green Dragon." We cite these (acts to show the recent origin of dirt track racing. It has become a sport so firmly fixed in the hearts of (air patrons that at the 1914 meeting of the American Association of Fairs and Ex - positions a committee was appointed with power to organize the Interna - tional Motor Contest Association, prepare and adopt rules and sanction dirt track meetings at the (airs. Forty-five meetings have been sanctioned during the year and a total saving made to our members of $3,700.00 bver (ees heretofore charged by the American Automobile Association for similar sanctions. The stock of the International Motor Contest Association was offered only to members of the American Association of Fairs and Expositions. It was divided into 250 shares at $10.00 each and each member requested to purchase not to exceed five shares. Your management has purchased five shares of this stock. Under the sanction issued, the Nebraska State </seg>

J. Alex Sloan and Huff Dorward acted as directors of the contest; H. E. Sidles, referee; Colonel C. J. Bills, Joseph Sheen and John G. Burket, judges; H. V. Riesen, clerk; Robert Lowery, Charles Miller and W. A. Lloyd, timers. Eight automobiles races were held each day, to well filled grand - stands. From careful conclusions drawn, we are of the opinion that from now on the public will demand automobile racing as a feature of our annual Fair. Bands A new departure was made in the selection of bands for the 1915 Fair. For the first time in a number of years no large foreign band was employed. Hagenow and his Nebraska State Band and George Green and his band were greatly appreciated in concert while the Fifth Regiment Band was the stand-by at the race track and evening programs. State Appropriation Representatives Naylor and Palmer, in the 1915 legislature, intro - duced our bill for a permanent swine barn to cost $80,000.00 but they refused to make such appropriation, giving us instead $7,500.00 for "Repairs and Sanitation." Of this amount $7,372.41 has been expended, of which only $300.00 was used in payment for the filling of the old bed of Antelope Creek. This leaves $127.59 in the fund unexpended. The statement showing the expenditure of this fund can be found in the 1915 report, page 273. Filling We have secured the privilege, from the officials of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy railroad and the Chicago and Rock Island rail - road, to remove the dirt from their right of way through the hill east of Seventeenth street and south of the fair grounds to such a level as their engineers may direct for the purpose of filling old Antelope Creek north of the Boys' Camp and west of the present swine barns. The Board of Managers are of the opinion that this dirt should be utilized in the effort to prepare all the enclosed Fair grounds for service - able use, as with the growth of the fair more room is being constantly demanded by the various departments. This dirt is the most available that can be secured contiguous to the Fair grounds, and we recommend that advantage be taken of the opportunity here presented. </seg>

In caring for this work blank books are prepared, containing a Hat of questions, and forwarded to the precinct assessor and summaries to the county clerks as prescribed by law. The statute requires the return of this data to our office by July 1st of each year, but a number of officials are prone to non-observance of the law. When the figures on acreage were received in 1915 we sent out to 3,500 correspondents located in all counties of the state for estimates of production. From the answers returned we found our averages by adding together all re - turns from each county and dividing the result by the number reporting. The statistical department of the government had their agents visit us many times during the season and we believe that they have profited by our labors. A' representative of a certain banking institution spent nearly a week in our office gathering figures and facts from which said bank issued a bulletin but failed to give the State Board of Agriculture credit for the figures obtained. We have furnished our figures to all who have asked for same, as our idea of such service carries unrestricted publicity to fully carry out the intent of the law and demonstrate to unbiassed minds the utility of this Board in carrying out matters entrusted to our care. </seg>
            <seg id="p038">■ PBOCEEDINOS NEBBASKA STATE BOARD Or AGRICULTURE The climatic conditions of 1915 were unusual and the excessive rain- fall caused extreme difficulties in the harvesting of small grain and curing of forage. Not only was this condition detrimental to harvesting small grain, but it also prevented the preparation of the land for the sowing of winter grain, which will be shown in restricted fall grain acreage for 1916. Early frost caught the corn in the northern part of the state; there- fore we have the peculiar condition, in that district of Nebraska not making its usual good showing in corn production. In the 1915 com- putation of agricultural statistics, printed in bulletin number 166, we find the agricultural wealth of Nebraska for 1915 to be: Per bushel Acres Av.

In the matter of valuation for dairy and poultry products, we know that the precinct and county assessors have been unable to make a proper return as farmers are not in the habit of keeping books of account in which each item of revenue or expenditure is put down </seg>
            <seg id="p039">39 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOABD OF AGRICULTURE We think a fair method in arriving at a conclusion as to the value of the raw product is to average the milk production of the 514,519 milch cows at five quarts per day, allowing six weeks dry time during the year, and we find a total of 830,948,185 quarts of milk with a farm value of 4.5 cents or a total production of 137,392,668. From careful estimates along the same lines we find the poultry and egg production about $35,000,000, which makes a total annual production from the thirteen leading crops, the animals grown, dairy and poultry raw products of $420,091,517, during the year 1915.. PUBLICITY The publicity bureau is the sales department of a state fair. No prosperous manufacturing concern would think of trying to get along without an efficient sales manager. For a state fair to curtail its publicity is to eventually reduce patronage. The State Board of Agriculture has consistently worked to advance the agricultural interests of the state through publicity. The methods used and the work done have been discussed, commented on and adopted in other states. Expense has been reduced, the output increased and the foundation laid for unlimited publicity for Nebraska and the state fair. Good crops, weather and publicity are the three great factors in state fair attendance. In adverse years publicity brings added patronage and in - creases receipts. In such a year as 1915 the value of an efficient publicity campaign can hardly be over estimated. Nebraska is a state of marvels. The record breaking crowd of 1915 is but a beginning and efficient publicity will ensure the patronage of most of the progressive farmers of the state.

Mellor: Before this revision report is read I want to state tonight we have our usual county and state fair banquet and Mr. Smith is now here with the tickets. I think he would like to see you and sell yon a ticket before you leave the room; is that right, Mr. Smith? Smith: Yes, sir. Graff: As a preliminary, I would like to say I am sorry that our report is not as short as the reports of some of the other committees, but to relieve the feeling some of you may have that we are trying to revolutionize the premium list I will say nothing of that kind is going to happen. Also, this committee feels they are unfortunate in not being able to grant every wish of everyone who had changes to offer. You will notice, when I read this report, that some of these revisions may sound rather sweeping to you but there is nothing dangerous about it. I will ask Mr. Danielson to stand by me a little. Will you all please take a premium list and follow closely. I will read slowly and we will probably get through much faster that way. (Starts reading the report.) </seg>

The superintendent of Machinery Hall shall receive $60.00. Eliminate the position of clerk of speed, making it superintendent and clerk combined at a salary of $50.00. &lt;a.) a. I wish to say our friend Riesen presented this request to the com - mittee. He is the man who has had charge of that department for several years. The committee felt it was rather an unusual thing to come before them and ask for the elimination of an employee for whom he could find no work. We granted that request of course. Ollis: I think you all have premium lists and if there is anything you want to talk about check it as he reads the report, and we will go back and take it up. In the last paragraph on page 13 where it states $2.00 per day, change to read $3.00 per day, and add "No person on the pay roll by the year or month shall receive extra compensation during Fair week."

In number 6 where it states "He shall receive a salary of $4.00 per day, "cut out all of line 13, all of line 14 and the word "services" in line 15 and substitute the following: "He shall receive a salary of $400.00 per annum." Page 17, line 2, cut out the following: "Designate a chairman to act in hia absence" and also the word "all" immediately following the word "absence"' in line 3.

Page 19, cut out the last paragraph in number 11 beginning "Each member of the Board" and ending with the word "employed" and insert the following: "The sum of $1,500.00 is annually appropriated as com - pensation for the Board of Managers, other than the President and Sec - retary, the same to be apportioned among its members as it may direct."

This may come as a surprise to you; this committee felt that these old veterans are becoming fewer every year.

We have about four hundred who attend on Monday and among them we have a lot of good, loyal boosters. Some of them will even go so far on that day as to pay their fare, keeping their buttons in their pockets until they get into the grounds. This rule of admission applies only to the Lincoln veterans', it does not apply over the state and I do not know whether it is wisdom to start this new method or not, of giving them the benefit of the whole week. I do not believe they are asking for it when we give them the privileges of the grounds on Monday. On page 23, to section 37 add the following: "In issuing permits for automobiles on the State Fair grounds during the time of the Fair there shall be three different classifications of permits. One known as the 'V permit which shall be good until ten o'clock in the morning of each day only. The 'O' permit good for entrance at all hours of the day but not good on Dunham avenue after ten a. m. The 'X' permit good any place on the grounds at any time, for the delivery of supplies only. Machines covered by the 'O' and 'V permits must not be left stand - ing to exceed thirty minutes at any one time." Page 23, section 42, cut out all beginning with the word "superinten - dent" in line 10 and concluding with the word "therefor" and insert instead the words "secretary, at Lincoln, Nebraska." And in all places where it states the fee shall be paid to the different superintendents change to read that the fee shall be sent to the Secretary at Lincoln (c). c. Graff: Those of us who have had any experience along this line know there is always more or less confusion with the exhibitor as to whom he shall send his fee and I believe this will do away with that.

Lawrence: Mr. Chairman, I do not know what your policy has been heretofore in regard to this but I must confess it is impossible for me to vote on this proposition with any degree of accuracy and fairness to myself. There is no element of policy in this matter but it is principally a matter of detail, which should be handled by the officers in charge. You ask whether the fees should be five or ten dollars and I could not tell; these things should be worked out by the officers in charge and the Board of Managers. I do not see where it is up to this body of men at all; this body should determine matters of policy and not go into such matters of detail. Von Forell: I just want to say that the Board of Managers has selected a committee on revision, they have made this revision anc now we shall simply say Amen to it, that is what I understand; we endorse Question called for.

Ollis: Let us come to order, gentlemen, and the secretary will call the roll. The secretary calls the roll and announces a quorum present. Ollis: We will now have the reports from the standing committees. The first committee is live stock, Charles Graff, chairman. Have you a report, Mr. Graff? Graff: Mr. Chairman, the report of the live stock committee was handed in to the secretary and I do not know what the duty of this body will be, whether you are going to have a lot of stale history read here all forenoon or whether you are going to accept It. Ollis: That is a question for this body to decide. Youngers: I make a motion that the reading of these reports be dispensed with and they be placed in the year book. Ollis: It is moved and seconded that the reading of the reports be dispensed with and that they be printed in the year book. Mellor: Heretofore a number of times we have been censured be - cause we did not discuss matters agricultural. These committees were appointed for that specific purpose. If all we are here for is to attend to the State Fair business alone, as has been said by some of the papers of the state, then we do not want to hear these reports. Now that is the reason we have had these committees report, so we could discuss these things; if any of you can offer suggestions for the betterment of agricul - ture, that is the proposition to think out. It is for you to say if you want to discuss these matters or whether we want to get through and go. Ollis: Any further remarks. Member: Could I ask this? I am heartily in sympathy with not wanting to listen to stale history but Mr. Graff knows whether that report con - tains anything that should be discussed or not. If there are things in the report that should be discussed Mr. Graff can tell us, no doubt and those might be taken up, as Mr. Mellor suggests. Graff: I would state that the chairman of this committee had to draw up that report himself; therefore he is not in a position to judge how stale the matter is. He tried, however, to touch upon the most interesting points to the stock interests of Nebraska. I feel, Gentlemen, that these reports, after all, do not amount to much. We can report to ourselves here in this body but when you stop to consider these reports will not be published and reach the people throughout the state for a year I am afraid by that time the reports will be more or less stale. I will frankly confess gentlemen, I am not much wrapped up in these reports. I believe they clutter up our annual report with a lot of matter which is </seg>

Mellor: Hay I offer as a substitute motion that if these reports are not read at this time that they be ordered printed in bulletin form and sent out as bulletins from the office as soon as possible, one following the other. Motion seconded Ollls: As I understand it, the way the motion now stands, we dis - pense with the reading of the reports and they be published in bulletin form and sent out as soon as possible.

Ollis: Good roads, T. B. Keedle, chairman Keedle: I do not know. I understood Mr. Chat burn would hand in this report the 17th of the month; I do not know whether he has handed it in or not as I have not seen him since I have been in the city but one will be handed in. Ollis: Marketing and production, L. W. Leonard, chairman Leonard: No report handed in and none made. You have an awfully bum chairman on that committee; the best men you have got on the Board were to help, Messrs, Dickman and Caley. Last year I spoke to these men about it and Mr. Dickman suggested we enlist Mr. Beckhoff, farm demonstrator of Seward county. We decided between ourselves that the report sent in last year is good enough to last two years. Ollis: That seems to cover all but the report on dairying; how about </seg>
            <seg id="p049">PROCEEDINGS NEBBA8KA STATE BOABO OF AOBICULTUBE 49 it, Mr. Sass, will that be handed in later or did you make a two year report also? Saas: I know very little about dairying and I think the best report we could get would be at the University. There was quite a report sent in last year and I think that should do. Ollis: Evidently there is a difference of opinion; some think they are stale now and some think they will hold good for two years. Mr. Thompson is here and asked me if he could hare five minutes time to bring up a subject before the county fair men. I think it is a little foreign to the fair business, but if there are no objection! we will hear Mr. Thompson; he has promised he will not take up more than five minutes. If there are objections, let them be known. Thompson: I will try not to infringe at all on the good nature of you men. I understand it is entirely out of line to talk to some forty or fifty delegates by the two-minute buttonhole. Sometimes it takes a great deal of time and is not satisfactory. What I have to say I will tell very briefly, if there should be a circuit of from four to six county fairs that would care to have us show our Shetland ponies with a minia - ture truck such as the packers use at the International and all big shows, we would like to make that arrangement. I do not have a truck like this but could order one with harness with a long K collar, the only one I know of has been used by George J. Hyle and it has been very satisfactory at both the International and the Eastern state fairs. I would get an exact duplicate of this if I had a certain amount of time, if I could make nve or six fairs. I would take, besides that, four or five or six ponies, not more than that. Would not ask for premiums but would take along ponies that would be winners at the state fair; also four or five colts which are the greatest interest to the children. This would cost from four to six hundred dollars. I will furnish this, pay all of my own expenses, take a tent along, there are no adequate arrange - ments. Franklin county hired a tent. We will hitch as many times as you want in reason with six or eight ponies, drive in front of the grandstand and give exhibitions there. We will do this two or three times a day, whatever you want, for $200.00 a fair. That is all I care to say. I see Mr. Harms in the back of the room. We went to Franklin county at his request; they had tried to get us for two years. If he will talk to you and tell you what we did and four or five or six fairs want us I will be glad to talk to you. Harms: Will say this— it was one of the best attractions we had on the grounds, a great drawing card, and satisfied lots of people. Mellor: If I can be granted a moment here, I think it would be well for you county fair men to get together and say where you will meet in your district in a place contiguous to your homes and then have the attraction men come to see you. Of course we would like all of you to come to Lincoln, but we realize the men in the western </seg>

If you will agree among yourselves and notify me where you will meet I will see when the attrac - tions committee comes to Nebraska that they come to see you at these places. Whether you buy anything or not it will be all right to do that, If you wish to consider such a proposition. I think it would be well for you county fair men to talk this over before leaving the city. Leonard: I have had a load on my mind last night and this mom - ing and will have to plead guilty. What I want to say now is much more out of order than this pony exhibit you have been talking about; yesterday I was out at the state farm and the swine men asked me to have one word changed in the premium list. I told them the premium list committee had the report all made up, but I would mention it yesterday afternoon. I overlooked it and do not know whether there is any way or not of bringing the matter up again, since this committee has been discharged. The change mentioned is on page 47 in regard to senior and junior pigs. If I understand this right the International Association of Fairs at Chicago made a new classification, I think a year ago last December, and have changed the date on the age of the pigs under six months from March 1st back to February 1st, but did not change the date on senior pigs from September 1st back to August 1st, and the Swine Breeders' Association asks if it can possibly be done, to change just this one word from September 1st to August 1st. It reads now "Senior pigs must have been farrowed on or after September 1st, 1914, and before February 1st, 1815." It is their desire this should read "Senior pigs must have been farrowed on or after August 1st and before February 1st." I know this is entirely out of order, but if there is any way of having this change made, I know it would be very satis - factory to the swine breeders of our state possibly it might make our classification different from that of other state fairs. You can tell us what was done at the Chicago meeting about that, Will. Mellor: At the meeting of the American Association of Fairs and Expositions, held at Chicago, the classification committee reported they had been around and talked this matter over with the breeders' asso - ciations. Mr. Gentry made a report that all the fairs in the United States which are following the plan of the American Association of Fairs have this rule in their book. We realize there are men who like to show pigs which are bred August 1st and soon after and not be barred from showing on account of the date being September 1st, but as long as the Iowa classification is this way I don't think it would be advisable to make the change for Nebraska alone. However, th s is a matter we would like to have had discussed with the swine breeders because we realize we show principally or primarily for Nebraska swine breeders, but at the same time when all the other classifications are different it would throw us out of tune, we might say, with the other fairs. Leonard: I cannot conceive the idea why they should want to </seg>
            <seg id="p051">l'WM KKIIIM.S \HIKV-K v STATE BOABD OF AGRICULTURE 51 make this classification in regard to what we call junior pigs and not make it (or senior pigs. I presume, but maybe I had better not presume, they think the hog men are patterning after the Red Polled cattlemen and trying to juggle these dates around a little. Ollis: I can tell you why they made it that way. Mr. Gentry comes from a warmer climate than we have where they can raise pigs earlier in the spring and later in the fall and therefore the southern states were in favor of changing to the earlier spring date, they would just as soon put the date back a little and make it October 1st. I think it was rather a compromise in making it September 1st, but that is the reason they want the early date in the spring and the later date in the fall, but it does not work very well in this country. Smith: I want to say, as one of the swine breeders of Nebraska, at the annual meeting last fall the matter of spring pigs was brought up and a vote taken in regard to the plan adopted by the association of fairs giving them February 1st. The vote was almost unanimous against it unless we could get the August pigs in at the same time. I think it might conflict with exhibitors from other states but, as Secretary Mellor has already said, we are making this fair principally for Nebraska breeders and they are the people we have to look to almost all the time for exhibits at our State Fair. This is absolutely asked for by the swine breeders of Nebraska. I would like to say, as one breeder, I would like to see it put to August 1st; it would relieve my conscience somewhat when I come down here with an August pig and call it September 1st. (Laughter). There seems to be others. Now it is true that it is hard to get February pigs, as Senator Ollis has said, in this climate, but we are doing it. We claim four or five February pigs are better than six or eight April pigs, so we are willing to show February pigs and call them February pigs, not show March pigs and call them February pigs. I would like to have this committee go to Chicago next year and get all the states in line for August 1st. If there is no motion before the house I will make a motion, if it can be legally done at this time, to change the word from September to August. Ollis: The motion is "That the word September 1st on page 47, be changed to read August 1st instead of September, wherever the same appears." Leonard: Now this does not work any hardship on these southern men if they want to come here; they can bring their October pigs and show them against our August pigs, as Mr. Ollis has already said, they can produce these pigs earlier than we can on account of the warmer climate. It would work a much greater hardship on the exhibitors if they would put this date October than to set it forward to February or August. Mellor: The understanding is to change everything from Septem - ber 1st to August 1st. We cannot change one classification because they show in more than one class in the herds. </seg>
            <seg id="p052">paorEEDiNcs Nebraska htate board of aorktltirk ■ KOUia: Wherever the word September appears, it should be changed August. Graff: I would like to hear that motion read. Motion as handed in, in writing, is as follows: "I move you that the word September 1st on page 47, be changed to read August 1st instead of September, wherever the same appears." The motion carried. Mel lor: I would suggest to Mr. Smith that when the swine breeders hold their meeting he have them write to the swine breeders' associa - tions and state (air associations of Iowa, Minnesota, South Dakota and Kansas and get them to do likewise, if they can. Member: I would like to know why this is changed, is it just the futurity pigs under six months and under one year so they can be seven months and thirteen months in order to obtain larger prizes. I think it is absolutely wrong in all the states to have pigs coming in February; the next thing we know they will be having January pigs and calling them February pigs. This will mean pigs coming in February or August, the coldest or hottest time of the year. I do not know what the hog men are doing but I think it is absolutely wrong. Ollis: We should have called for an additional report from the Credential committee; have you an additional report to make? Ryan: The reports have all been handed in and signed up Mellor: I would like to ask a question- This is out of order, but I beg your Indulgence. Referring to this motion that has just been passed, what effect will it have on the offerings of the various swine breeders associations; their offerings are running close to $1,000.00 for the swine industry in the State of Nebraska. How will it affect that? Smith: If It will make them ineligible from any state they will have to be classed as under six months. Mellor: If they refuse to pay on that ground, you fellows are to blame and not the State Fair Board. Danielson: Was there not some information from these associa- tions? Mellor: They make their offerings on the basis of the rules adopted by the American Association of Fairs and Expositions, and now we are changing them. If they refuse to pay their premiums, we cannot help It. Danielson: That is just the reason, when I was sitting on that committee, I went in to you and asked you if you had any information from these associations. We were looking over the hog section of the premium list when that proposition came before us, you gave me the report of the National meeting in Chicago and they had sanctioned Febr- </seg>
            <seg id="p053">53 PMX'KEUINOH XEMA8KA STATE BOARD OK AURU II.TIKK uary 1st and September 1st and this committee passed it as such. I think the Poland China people are giving $600.00 against our $160.00 and the National Duroc Jersey Association are giving $400.00 against our $100.00. If it is in any way going to conflict and we lose that money I think the hog men of the State of Nebraska are going to be big losers. Smith: I would like to say here if this is going to withdraw the premiums offered by the different swine breeders' associations, I want this Board of Managers to be empowered to put this date back, I do not want to lose that money. (Laughter.) I mean I do not want the fair to lose it, I do not see any reason for their doing so as It puts them all on the same basis. I wish to make that a motion at this time. Motion carried unanimously. Ollis: If you people want to get any action before this national Pair Managers' Board it might have some strength if you would pass a resolution here in regard to changing the date from September to August 1st. Leonard: I think we had better let that Chicago matter alone and if our Board finds this conflicts with the different record associations offering these premiums they have the power not to insert this motion. So far as I am personally concerned, I have always been opposed to these date of August and February 1st. When I was in Chicago four or five years ago Mr. Gentry brought this matter up at that time. It did not carry them but later on it did. You remember, Mr. Mellor, I talked against those dates at that time. I was always opposed to it, but if it will relieve the consciences of such men as Smith and McKelvie (I will not say anything about him as he is not here) and it does not work any hardship on any exhibitor, I am perfectly willing to let them have it. It is now in the hands of the Board of Managers, and if they find it is going to conflict with the offerings of these record associa - tions I think the only way is to let the Board say whether they will put in the word August or September. Ollis: If there is anything else you want to bring before the meet - ing now is the time to speak up, if you have anything on your mind. Strader: I have just a little word I waat to say, especially to the county fair men, about the Boys' Camp. I think Mr. Von Forell will agree we did not have as many boys as we should have had to take care of the amphitheatre crowds this year. We need 125 men to take care of the amphitheatre, and if the county fair men will use their influence in getting boys appointed from their counties we will hare no trouble in bringing our attendance up. I think you will all agree the camp was a great success. If you could carry yourself back a few years when you were twelve or fifteen years of age you can imagine what it would mean to those boys from the western counties; you would know some- </seg>
            <seg id="p054">54 rKlH'KKIIINCK NEBBAHKA STATK HOARD OF AUBil I I.T1KK thing about the influence and pleasure that came to those boys. I could name some members of the Board who did not use very much influ - ence in getting boys from their particular district, but we will try to handle them in some other way. If you county fair men will make it a point this year to work with the proper parties for the appointment of a couple of bright young boys who will come and get the benefit of this week we will appreciate it very much and I think we will have 100 to 125 boys. Keedle: I rise for information in regard to whether the boys have been provided for financially for this meeting. I have not heard any motion to pay them their little railroad fare and their little dues; there - fore I will make a motion if it has not been acted upon. I move the State Board be authorized to pay the delegates for three days at $4.00 per day and their railroad fare. Motion seconded. Ollis: You have heard the motion, that the treasurer be authorized to pay the delegates $4.00 per day for three days and railroad fare. Any remarks? Member: What has been the custom in this matter? Ollis: We have been paying $6.00 for the meeting and railroad fare. Mellor: It might be all right to pay it this year but if we start such a precedent and have a bad year, what are we going to do about it, Tom? Johansen: I amend that by making it the same as last year, $6.00 and railroad fare. Banning: I second the amendment. Leonard: Heretofore these members called in on committee work have had a day extra; we do not want to make this a blanket rule and leave these committees out. The rank and file, I do not see why they have not fared pretty well. Banning: It seems to me $3 00 a day is all right; we can buy lots of stuff we do not need, in Lincoln, on $3.00 a day. Ollis: I will say the extra day the committee men put in is cared for by the Board of Managers. Member: It does not seem to me three days is any too much; you take the western part of the state, it takes a day to get here and two days here, there is four or five days for the men from the western part of the state and it seems to me three days is none too much at $4.00 per day. If that would not be satisfactory we might get at it in another way, let them have each according to the time they are on the road, I think four days would practically cover all here. Leftwich: There is no one who can visit this meeting and get back inside of three days unless he lives on the edge of the city. It </seg>
            <seg id="p055">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 55 looks as if three days was not exorbitant even if it does establish a precedent, for a fellow cannot get very far with $3.00 a day at the present time, with the high cost of living, you all know that. Your room will cost you $2.00 and you will have to live pretty economically. We expend a good deal of money extravagantly in our operations and I do not think we should strain at a point like this when men are taken away from their homes for four days and we are only asking for three days. I do not think It is out of the way even if we do establish a precedent. Agee: I am heartily in favor of Mr. Keedle's motion for a number of reasons. There are a number of boys here who could not make it in five days. Yesterday we passed resolutions raising salaries of every - body connected with the Fair from a few dollars to several hundred dol - lars. I believe it is no more than fair to the boys from the west that they should corns in here and get at least part of what they are entitled to when they come so far and get so little for their work. Smith: The establishment of a precedent in a matter of this kind does not mean anything with a body like this, the same body can vote this down another year. The treasury was bankrupt a year ago and the expenses were curbed until they got money in the treasury again. If we are in bad shape next year I am in favor of cutting it down and keeping it down until they are able to pay their actual expenses. Three days is not too much, most of us spend four. Von Forell: A year ago when this matter was up for discussion you nearly made it so profitable for me to come from Scottsbluff on the mileage system that I protested against receiving a plutocrat's wages for coming to the state fair, proposed in the largeness of your hearts, and before we had figured what it would amount to, as it would give us in the western part of the state a decided advantage on the mileage rate, but I do not feel at this time four days is any too much. Four days will not take me back home, it will take me about six days to get out to where I live, but I do not want pay for six days, three days will be sufficient. Of course, while I can get back to Scottsbluff in four full days, traveling nights, to where I now live on my ranch it will take me practically another day to get there. I do not feel three days at $4.00 is excessive. When the State Board was hard up there was not a man on this Board who was not willing to cut down and make a sacrifice in order that the management might curtail expenses. When prosperity came we all agreed these things should be put back and I know I voted for the raise in salaries, whether I was a beneficiary or not. I voted for an increase for every member whose salary was cut down on account of the hard times. Smith told the truth, if we have hard times again we will all willingly share adversity together; when pros - perity is ours we want to share in the prosperity. Ollis: The question comes on the amendment, which would read that each delegate should be paid $6.00 and railroad fare; all in favor signify by saying aye (Two votes affirmative.) The motion is lost. </seg>

Motion carried. Whitebead: I would like to ask, as a matter of information, from the gentleman who spoke of the boys' camp, in regard to it. A lot of we fellows in the western part of the state do not know what they are here for. Von Forell: I was just going to say in our county we have an experiment station and the head of this station is supposed to be one of the committee to appoint these boys; the county superintendent is to be another member of that committee. Being the member of the State Fair Board I was on the committee to appoint these boys, as I have a pretty wide acquaintance in my home county and keep in touch with the school boys I think I have been exceptionally fortunate in my selection. The county superintendent and the supervisor instructed me to do as Professor Knox said, "Go ahead and I will endorse anything you do." We have made selections of boys on the farm as a rule; we have tried to pick those boys who really wanted to do something, boys who could go back and give a good report. Each year we have selected boys of this kind, with one exception, and they have received a re - markable amount of benefit, barring this one exception we have had a class of boys who have set on fire every other boy in the schools and we do not have to go gunning for boys any more; they show eager - ness and willingness to come and we have a large field to select from. It would be a good idea if every county and state fair man would stimulate the Interest in this camp, in his own locality. We have tried to select young men who would probably want to turn their attention to the study of agriculture and be a candidate for the agricultural college, and we have succeeded in doing this, in a measure, and we will do it more. There is more than getting a delegate from your county — you want a delegate who literally can receive an inspiration and can inspire others. If you will all do your part we will have a full quota of boys. There is one thing I want to say. the boys who live close by do not get the railroad fare the boys out west get. There is but little induce - ment for the boys at home, they can go to the Fair without much expense and they do not care to enter into the strenuous life which is required. We find the boys who came from near home got homesick and wanted to go home and I have known several instances where the boys were back at the Fair seeing the sights later in the week. They do not like the strenuous life of the camp. It seems to me some provision should be made whereby some of these western counties can send an additional delegation if the nearby counties do not send their full quota; the boys out there are far from the center of things and there is a dearth of the things of which the boys in this part of the state have a surfeit. You will find the boys from that part of the country will be studious in the camp and will perform their duties and will eventually find their way into </seg>
            <seg id="p057">I'KIM KKMM.S NEBBAHKA STATE HOABO OF AOBICULTUBE 57 the agricultural school and be students there. Several of the boys there now got their first inspiration from the boys' camp. Lawrence: We have always filled our quota of boys from Dawes County, and we could certainly send more if you would permit us to. Our boys always looked forward to this proposition of coming to the State Fair; we hold it out as an inducement to them. In 1914 we sent two boys. One of them eventually took first prize in the potato contest in the boys' and girls' club and this materially helped in giving us a full quota to draw from, last year. One of the boys who came down last year I know has taken fourth place in the pig contest this year; it gives an inspiration to the boys and they think it is well worth while. Member: I for one will see that our county is represented. I believe the boys should have their appointment early so they can prepare themselves and look forward to the time of coming. When they do not get their ap - pointment until late in the fall the question of the starting of school comes up and they will either have to stay out of school or stay at home. If they get their appointment by May 1st they can prepare themselves. I will see our county is represented. Cheney: I wish to offer a resolution: "Whereas attempts are being made at this time to raise the railroad rates in the State of Nebraska, therefore. Be it Resolved by the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture that we are opposed to a raise in the railroad rates in this state at this time; Resolved, That we commend our Attorney General in his efforts resist - ing the attempt of the transportation companies to raise the present rates." I move the adoption of the resolution. I second the motion. Strader: I think I had the floor on this boys' camp matter and want to clean it up while we are at it. Leftwich: Is there a motion before the house on this boys' camp? Ollis: A member got up and asked for information, he had the floor and was practically recognized. Strader: If the Board pleases I think I will read you my report, it is just a little more than a page. It is only a little more than a page and will show you what we are trying to do out there. </seg>

The new tent houses which the Board so kindly built for the boys were a great success. No matter what the weather might have been the boys would have been entirely comfortable. They took great pride in keeping their tents neat and clean. I am sure that the plan of using the tent leaders as head ushers was a real improvement. These leaders understood their boys and because of this they were able to work most harmoniously and I think most effec - tively. I wish it were possible for me to convey to you the appreciation shown by the boys of the camp and what they learned. A great number of them came to camp director and myself and wished that they might come back next year. I should like also to say a word in connection with the work done by the camp director, Mr. King. I have never known a more zealous worker among boys and have never known a man so able to give inspiration and helpful counsel than Mr. King. I consider that the Fair management are very fortunate in having the services of this man in connection with this camp. The things most needed in the way of equipment to make the boys' camp an ideal one are, first, an athletic field, with a volley ball and tennis court and a base ball diamond. This can be done with little expense by merely leveling off the field in front of the tent houses. Another much needed improvement would be a shower bath which could ba easily made by merely stretching a canvas around a spray somewhere close to the tent houses. With these things added it would be lsss difficult to interest the boys in the afternoons and early evenings after the attraction of the Fair itself was worn away. Respectfully submitted, CHAS. STRADER, Supt. of Camp. Ollis: Now, Mr. Cheney, your motion is on order; will you send up your resolution? The motion is on the adoption of the motion offered by Mr. Cheney, are there any remarks in regard to it? The motion was carried unanimously. Ollis: Is there anything else? If not we will proceed with the elec - tion of officers. I will appoint Mr. Jackson, Mr. McLaughlin and Mr. Meese as tellers. You gentlemen will please come forward, distribute the ballots and then collect them. There have been one or two questions asked in regard to this ballot, as to whether a delegate has a right to vote for all the candidates from the different districts or only in the district in which he resides.

In the Second district you will find it states "vote for two." Is there any question from anyone who does not understand this ballot or how to vote it? The Secretary will call the roll and as each man's name is called he will stand and one of the tellers will get his bal - lot. The votes were collected and counted by the tellers.

Ollis for President of the Nebraska State Board of Agricul - ture for the ensuing year. Wolcott: Mr Ollis is elected. Ollis: Gentlemen I certainly appreciate this election and I just want to make a short statement here. In order to obviate making it too long I hare written it. Gentlemen of the State Board of Agriculture: Here we are again, with another year of history written, and a new year just beginning. What of the past, and what of the future? Shall we rest and be sat - isfied with the things already accomplished? Let us not follow the path of the proverbial calf which made a wobbly path through the wilderness which others followed until finally a city boulevard grew out of the narrow winding course. The calf did the best he could under the circumstances; but those who followed were in a groove and followed only because it was the line of the least resistance. It has been said that there is no difference between a groove and a grave, except in the depth, and continued rolling along in the groove eliminates even that difference. The success attained up to the present time will go down in history as a great achievement, made possible only by the earnest work of en - thusiastic men who have given their best thought and efforts to the up - building of the State Fair. The holding of the Fair has been practically all that has been at - tempted thus far, but I believe there are other lines we should take up now. The State Fair is a great educational Institution. It is a school in which every citizen of the State should ba a student. This education is not gained from lectures by teachers or professors, but by object lessons. Every person, whether a student in a country school, a graduate from the state university, or a student on the farm, in the factory, bank or mer - cantile house, can here find valuable instruction which can be obtained nowhere else. We are responsible for the attractiveness with which these object lessons are placed before the public. Will any of those enlisted in the work fall behind, or shall we all pull together? If all together, then how? Surely not permitting one or two leaders to push ahead and the others merely to follow. Every one of the twenty-nine members, and every one of the presidents and delegates from county societies has a part to do. Don't think for a minute that when you have come here, voted. </seg>
            <seg id="p062">62 nOCXEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AOKICtLTUKE F drawn your per diem, that you are done, and that all you have to do the balance of the year is to sit back and criticize what some one else is doing. If any one fails to do his best, It never can be made up by some one else, and the sum total of work accomplished will 'fall that much short of the ideal. The Board of Managers will be directly responsible for the staging of the State Fair, but they need the advice, help and encourage - ment of the rank and file. We have had wonderful exhibits of live stock, and wonderful displays of agricultural products as well as of machinery and many other lines. t^rs going through the exit gates go through with many new things ned. and with inspiration and determination to produce and do better things in the future than in the past. As I said before, there are other lines of work that should now be taken up. One of these is a publicity department. This is a field not now covered either by the University or the farm press. And I want to tell you that while we have a splendid line of farm papers in Nebraska, edited and managed by able men, still a publicity department properly handled would be a benefit not only to citizens generally, but to the farm papers as well. Such a department should be conducted by a man thor - oughly acquainted with agricultural activities, including stock, grain and machinery. He should keep in touch with the work that the State Vet - erinary department is doing both as to live stock diseases, quarantines for contagious diseases, station inspection, and shipping rules. New labor saving machinery should be brought before the public. I sometimes think that farm papers, loyal as they are to farmers and farmers' interests, possibly because they must draw much of their income from advertising, are a little slow to mention new labor saving devices until the owner or manufacturer becomes financially strong enough to advertise freely. A department of this kind could not be run on wind alone. To make it what it should be, some traveling expenses would have to be incurred, for if such a department is made a success, it can not be composed of statis - tics alone. Speaking of statistics, I am not going to inflict any upon you today. The annual report of the Board is printed, and can be obtained free by applying to the Secretary. This report contains a complete statement of the work of the Board, both financial and otherwise, and I hope all you men will obtain a copy each, and acquaint yourselves with details which it is impossible to give at this meeting. There is another thing that I want to bring to the attention of the Board, and that is the need of a real superintendent of transportation. Many exhibitors, especially new ones who are not acquainted, hava had great trouble in getting their exhibits into and out of the Fair grounds. I believe a man familiar with railroad transportation problems, with an office where every one could find htm, could render valuable service. Those of you who are appointed superintendents have a responsi - bility for the success of your departments. You should begin at once and </seg>

These exhibits do not just grow, like Topsy, but have to be assembled under the direction of a master mind. Others of you should talk State Fair to the people in your several communities, encourage people to prepare exhibits, write to the superin - tendents and tell them where exhibits may be obtained, and last but not least, tell your neighbors about the real value of the State Fair in educa - tion and inspiration. Let me tell you encouragement is what most of us need, even more than education. We as a people know better than we do. One of the most hopeful facts connected with this organization is that new blood is yearly going into its membership. This is necessary to the life and success of any organization. Some say, "when you have a good man, don't change," but there are always other good men, and new men coming in not only profit by the experience and work of those before them, but bring new and valuable ideas. It has never been disputed that the interest of the Board is paramount to that of any man or group of men. One of the healthiest indications of the future success of the State Board is that the members are not afraid to scrap, if need be, in sup - port of their individual opinions ; but after the majority have spoken, every member says Amen and goes forward for a pull together. I can not close without a word of appreciation of the confidence you have placed in me by electing me as your president. If at the next annual meeting I can turn the trust over to some other man with the knowledge that the work in 1916 has brought better results than ever before, I shall indeed be happy. Gentlemen, I pledge you my best efforts. Friends need not expect special favors, and enemies, if there be such, need not fear a stab in the back. My work will be in the open, and directed only toward making the best possible record for the State Board of Agriculture in 1916. J. A. OLLIS.

M. W. H. Smith: Ladies and Gentlemen: It seems that both the State Board and county organization are unfortunate tonight in that the presi - dents of both are absent, Mr. Roberts, President of the State Board of Agriculture, being ill at his home in Fremont and Mr. Wilson, President of the Nebraska Association is also ill at his home in Geneva. As a re - sult it has been necessary for us to draft a man and in place of Mr. Wil - son we have selected Mr. George Jackson, who is well known to all of you, as the presiding officer for this evening. Preliminary to his presentation, however, I want to say that it is just six years ago tonight that this organization was formed in the old Commercial Club rooms in the Fraternity building. I recognize a num - ber of familiar faces tonight, who wera present at that meeting. We have held these meetings each year since, with a varying attendance, usual y about what we have on this occasion. We have enjoyed the spread fur - nished by the Commercial Club but I might add the cigars were not on the program. To Lincoln's merchant prince, Mr. Rudge. we are indebted for this treat (applause.) And we will all enjoy them. I now take pleasure in presenting Mr. Jackson, who will preside during the presenta - tion of the program (applause). Jackson: Ladies and gentlemen, members of the county fair organ - ization and politicians (applause); I am very sorry indeed that Mr. Wil - son is unable to be here. I know he could handle this job so much better than I. I am not an orator nor the son of one nor am I a toastmaster and the Governor here had the audacity to ask me if I was going to spring any poetry and I want to tell you, before we dance the next set, just how I got to writing poetry. I was walking through a cemetery one day when I saw some young people over the way reading verses on a tombstone. I thought I would go over and see what all the excitement was about, and this is what I read: Here lies my wife, Amanda Proctor, She got the grippe and wouldn't doctor; She could not stay, she had to go, Blass God from whom all blessings flow. The first gentleman on the program is Henry Pickett of Wahoo, who will talk to us on the subject of Agricultural School Exhibits at County Fairs, and without any further preliminaries I will introduce Mr. Henry Pickett of Wahoo. Mr. Pickett: Mr. President and Fair Managers: The committee this last year had a pretty hard time in getting together to make up the routing of the exhibits, but after three attempts we prepared a routing </seg>

I will read that re - port; there were twenty-seven applicants in all and to divide them be - tween the six weeks Fair season was not an easy matter. Report from Mr. Pickett Mr. President and Members of the Nebraska County Fair Association: Your committee this year had a rather hard time getting together to study out the proper routing for the State Farm exhibit, but after three attempts the schedule was prepared and the various ones to whom the exhibit was awarded, were notified of the selection. There were twenty-seven applicants in all and to divide them up among a six weeks' fair season was not a very easy matter. Your com - mittee feels, regardless of all the grief the exhibit had this season on ac - count of rain and mud at the various points, that it is a winner, and this year, with proper weather more will visit it than have visited it both years past and prove our belief. Mr. Bothwell, of the extension service, had charge of the exhibit and I don't believe a better report could be submitted to this Association than the one prepared by him, so I wish to submit it for your approval. The following schedule was prepared for the State Farm exhibit: Aug. 30-Sept. 4 — Hamilton County, at Aurora. Sept. 6-10 — Nebraska State Fair, at Lincoln. Sept. 13-18— Pawnee County, at Pawnee. Sept. 20-25 — Platte County, at Columbus. Sept. 27-Oct. 2— Webster County, at Bladen Oct. E-8 — Nemaha County, at Auburn. Oct. 13-16 — Jefferson County, at Fairbury. Other applicants for same week: A\n: 30-Sept. 4 — Scotts Bluff, Thayer, Polk Sept. 13-1S— Antelope, Brown, Clay, Custer, Dawes, Dundy, Hall, Har - lin, Keith. Madison, Merrick, Seward, Platte, Fillmore. S-ept 20-25— Johnson, Dodge. Sept. 27-Oct 2— Gage. Shortly before the beginning of the season Platte County changed the date of their Fair and forfeited their opportunity to secure the ex - hibit. Johnson County had already applied for the week made open by Platte County's change and Johnson County was given Platte County's place on the schedule. The final schedule was then Hamilton, State Fair, Pawnee, Johnson, Webster, Nemaha and Jefferson. The Aurora Fair was held during ideal weather. A soft south breeze blew steadily during the entire week. Warm sunshiny days brought im - mense crowds and it was estimated that 7,500 people inspected the ex - hibit during the week. </seg>
            <seg id="p068">■ PBOCUDl.N'US SEBKASKA STATE HUAJU) OK AURU'l'LTl'BE tAt the State Fair the exhibit was not assembled as a unit, each de - ment of the College of Agriculture taking charge of their particular s. Many thousands of people, however, were attracted by the Uni - ity exhibits, of which the cases formed an important part. • tThe exhibit was loaded Friday evening and Saturday morning fol - ng the State Fair preparations made to open at Pawnee the following day. During the day (Saturday) Pawnee people notified us they were postponing their Fair until later in the season. Efforts ware made to place the exhibit at one of the other fourteen points which had applied for the exhibit that week, but as there was practically no tima at all, it was found impossible to make arrangements The exhibit remained idle during the week following the State Fair but was set up at Tscumseh, Johnson County, the following Monday. The assistants accompanying the exhibit were handicapped in setting up at Tecumseh by the mud. Evreything was ready for the opening of the Fair, however, and conditions seemed to indicate a large crowd. However, rains cut off two-thirds of the attendance, which for the week was estimated to have been at the exhibit 1,800. From Tecumseh the Burlington railroad favored us with a special routing on the car to Bladen, Webster County, in order that the exhibit be ready for the opening of the Fair. Almost incessant rains kept the people away from this Fair and it was held over Saturday in an attempt to have at least one favorable day. About 1,500 saw the exhibit here. From Bladen the exhibit went to Auburn. The weather turned cold at Auburn and the Fair goers found it necessary to wear overcoats. An indication of the way cold weather and rain will keep people away from county fairs may be gained from the following: Last year at Auburn 3,800 inspected the exhibit; this year a greater percentage of the people on the ground were interested in the exhibit and our attendance fell to 2,500. From Auburn the exhibit was transferred to Fairbury, the last point. The weather started out fine at Fairbury and we hoped to wind up with at least a fair week. Fairbury holds over one day later than the other fairs, Friday and Saturday being the big days. Rain fell heavily all day Friday and Friday afternoon it was impossible to continue with the Fair for the day. A total of three inches of rainfall ruined the prospects for a good week. In spite of the awful mud on Saturday our tent was crowded from 10 o'clock until closing time. It is estimated 1,800 people was the total number inspecting our exhibit. Our total attendance this year was 15,100 for the five counties. Last year seven counties, 35,000. The average this year was 3,020 against last year's 5,000. The unfavorable weather turned what would otherwise have been a favorable year into a disappointment at each point excspt Auburn, in spite of which I am sure the exhibit will prove to be more popular than ever In 1916, several urgent applications already having been made. </seg>

One good turn deserves another and we should divide it around a little. I thank you. Jackson: All these questions are open for discussion. We will be glad to hear from any one with any questions you care to ask. Mr. Picket will be glad to answer them. Member: What steps do we have to take to obtain this exhibit? Pickett: Well, just make a regular application and mail it either to Professor Pugsley or the Committee. Applications are given considera - tion and the routing is of course prepared after all the applications have been gone over. If there are three counties in the South Platte wanted the exhibit and they are close together and come one, two and three it would not be a good idea to send the exhibits away up in the north part of the state or away out west that week; the week between the towns nearest get the exhibit. If these towns in the North Platte district will get their fairs lined up so saveral of them will come together it would not be a hard matter to route those exhibits that way, but where they are scattered all over the North Platte territory it is pretty hard to give those towns as much considaration as the committee would like. Make out an application and mail it to Professor Pugsley, I think that would be the best way to do it. ' Blacknian : I have not heard Mr. Pickett mention anything about Madison County, he wrote me Madison County was the first applicant and yet we have not been considered. The wsek our Fair was on the exhibit was idle, and yet so far as I know there was no effort made to send the exhibit to Madison County although in 1914 and 1915 Madison County was one of the first to send in an application for that exhibit. Pickatt: I can answer that right off. In 1914 you had your Fair ex - actly the same date as the State Fair and you could not have considera - tion then, over the State Fair. This last year, on account of the short notice given us, we did not have time to do anything; but two years ago, in 1914, you will remembar you had your Fair exactly the same week as the State Fair. Blacknian: Yes, we had the same date as the State Fair, </seg>
            <seg id="p070">70 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGBK'l'LTVBE Pickett: Well, you could not expect it over the State Fair Blackmail: Last year we thought we got our application in plenty early, at least we think the North Platte country' should be represented a little. Of course, as I understand it, Platte County was put in on the list ahead of Madison but afterwards on account of changing dates we lost out. But what I am trying to get at is whether these applications are taken up in the order they are received, that is the question. Pickett: They were not all handled in the order received, some of these counties would make a good showing, they would get their Commer - cial Club to back the proposition, send in a whole bunch of telegrams, a representation would come down and it was a pretty squirmy corner. Jackson: Is there anything further? Pugsley: I think I can throw just a little light on the routing of the exhibit. It is necessary to take into consideration the applications of course, in relation one to another and the dates of the fairs. For example, it is impossible to move ths exhibit over a large territory and get it set up in time for the next Fair, it has been necessary heretofore to route this exhibit on one railroad rather than on several and the committee, 1 think, recognizes that next time it should be put north of the Platte. II will be routed on one railroad and if you can get several of your fairs ip one locality to make application for the exhibit and these dates come one after another it should be an easy matter to get the exhibit if you still want it. Report from Mr. Kokjer Mr. President and Members: This committee was appointed last January to confer with Prof. Pugsley at the State Farm and draw up contracts with local fairs for the State Farm exhibit which the management of the State Farm was so kind to offer the Fair managers, and for the further purpose of routing the same. Your committee met at Prof. Pugsley's office at the State Farm on two different occasions; the first meeting was for the purpose of organizing and arranging the contents of the contracts and get a more thorough knowledge of the proposed exhibit; the last meeting was for the purpose of routing the exhibit. H. M. Kokjer was elected chairman and Henry Pickett, Secretary of the committee. I will say here that all members of the committee were present at both meetings with Prof. Pugsley. While the routing of the exhibit to the satisfaction of everyone was impossible as we well knew, we did make an effort to do the best that was possible for the majority. In all there were twenty applicants, some located quite a distance from Lincoln -and others close to Lincoln. Prof. Pugsley informed the </seg>

Clay Center for Clay County had no opposition for the exhibit the first week on account of the earliness of the season. Wahoo won the exhibit for Saunders County away from four other applicants on account of the fact that it was relatively near to Lincoln. Madison County wanted tha exhibit State Fair week, but it was re - served for the State Fair, where it was thought that it would serve more people. Fillmore County won the choice of five applicants. Its strongest com - petitor was Pawnee County. Location again won the choice owing to the fact that Auburn had petitioned for Nemaha County, and it was believed that a portion at least, of Pawnee County could be served from Auburn. Additional deference was accorded tha Fillmore County fair petition owing to the fact that H P. Wilson, Secretary of the Fillmore County Fair As - sociation and President of the County Fair Managers Association of Ne - braska, was the father of the county Fair exhibit movement. Auburn won over seven applicants for the fifth week on account of location. Gage County received preference in two applications for sixth week. It was then learned that Auburn and Beatrice had set their fairs back a week and the dates upon their applications were wrong so Nelson in Nuckolls County which was very desirous of the exhibit was passed on and won. They being so close to Geneva. The contract price for the exhibit was $100.00. Besides this the Fair Association paid for the hauling and help to set the exhibit up, and fur - nished police protection at night. The State Farm exhibit contained among ether things photographs of various plant diseases, specimens of the destructive insects and birds as well as a method of their extermination, also specimens of birds and in - sects which are of assistance to farmers, illustrations of the students' work in the workshop, the forge shop, the work with farm implements in the laboratory and in field practice, and as they say on sale bills "and many other articles too numerous to mention." The exhibit was very at - tractively gotten up and while I didn't have as much time as I would have liked to look over the exhibit, the little time that I spent there I was con - vinced that there were lots of people getting information out of the ex - hibit as they kept the demonstrators very busy answering questions. The canning demonstration proved to be quiet a success and a lady told me shortly before leaving to come down here that her fruit that was canned during our fair was still in good condition, and I of course told her I was real glad to hear it.

The demonstration (or the eradication of hug cholera was conducted by Drs. Day and Lintner, two exceedingly skillful gentlemen in their pro - fession. The people that attended this feature were very much benefited. We had previous to their arrival, placed a tent 40 x 60 ft. near the State Farm exhibit and quite a number of benches inside for the benefit of the crowd. Two tables were made use of by the doctors for their medicines and for the operation that they performed on the hog. Those who saw this knew whether they had been performing the operation right or not at and is considered a very conservative estimate The following partial quotation from some of the letters received by Prof. Pugsley indicate the attitude of visitors and members of this Association: "The exhibit was far better than I expected. In fact I think it one of the greatest educational features of the county fairs where shown. The information one can obtain is very valuable. I was too busy to spt.id as much time in the exhibit tent as I would have liked, but I could name twenty or more features qf the exhibit that any farmer could well afford to pay twice the amount of admission to the fair for anyone of them. The Fair management and the people of the county are more than pleased with the exhibit, and while we do not wish to be selfish, we would like the exhibit again next year, if it is possible to get it. I feel certain that this trial exhibit will make the exhibition a permanent fixture to the live county fairs in the state, and I believe you will see a marked increase in the number of boys taking the agricultural work after the exhibit has been out a few years." — H. L. McKelvie, Fairfield, Neb.

Your committee would recommend that this feature be made perma - nent, if it is possible, so to do and that the fairs organize their own cir - cuits, one following another, and if more than one exhibit is to go forward which is likely, an exhibit can be turned to each one of the circuits and a long haul will not be necessary, in this way it will keep expenses down. Respectfully submitted, H. M. KOKJER, HENRY PICKETT, JACOB WEIS. Jackson: If there is nothing further, we will take up the next sub - ject — What the Fair Does for a Community — this subject is one everybody should be interested in and ought to bring out a lot of good oratory. We have plenty of it around this table and other places around the room, but it seems the speaker, Mr. Van Horn of Lexington, is not present. We have, however, a gentleman from the western part of the state who I understand is conducting one of the best fairs in the state. He will handle this subject and I know we will all be pleased to listen. We will now listen to L. R. White of Lexington on the question of what the fair does for the community. What the County Fair Does For a Community The fair is undoubtedly one of the greatest, if not the greatest avenue open to all the people as a get-together meeting for a community of interests that has been devised. I cannot conceive of any organization if properly conducted that provides the advantages that this kind of venture does for the betterment of all classes, old and young alike. As a stimulation for the people to do better things and more of them, I do not know of any undertaking that any where near reaches the object intended. Fairs reach and benefit every avenue of industrial life. From an educational point of view, the fair is far reaching. It is of </seg>
            <seg id="p074">74 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA 8TATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE great benefit to a large class of people, who were It not for such advantages as the fair provides, would probably never obtain any idea of the advancement the country is making along many lines. This is true of the stranger within your gates, who may be from some far country, as well as the people of the community in which the fair is held. It is to be regretted that there are those who ar? apparently not interested in the advancement of the country wherein they live. The advantages to be derived from an advertising view point are many. We know whereof we speak on this question, from the observa - tion we have had from several years experience as secretary of one of the best county fairs in this great stats. We also know from what we l\ave heard, and from the natural results obtained by many of our exhibitors that this advantage is not to be despised. The financial results from the fair are numerous; which any observ - ing person cannot help but notice if he will but give credit where the credit belongs. We will admit that the direct financial profits are not usually in evidence except to a few, but in the years to come if those interested in the community in which the fair is held, will look backward to the efforts put forth by the faithful of the past and present generations, thty will have to admit the bare facts that the untiring energy, the unselfish devotion, the sacrifice of time and labor of a few generous, broad minded benefactors have paved the way for better things which will be of greater financial benefit. As the old style fair failed to interest the people to the extent that it might become a lasting benefit to the public, someone evolved the scheme of adding the night fair and amusement feature. This addition has caused most fair boards many vexing problems. Who shall say that the free act and the carnival do not have their place in making the fair a success? There are many acts of merit that can be had. that are instructive to the people and as the gate receipts are the backbone of the financial end of the fair, this kind of entertainment has its redeem - ing quality to fair and patron. It is true that carnivals sometimes have features which do not saem beneficial; but these may be of service to enlighten a certain element, in fact there is a certain per cent of people who would not be interested if it were not for the merry-go-round, ferris wheel and cheap show, as well as the many games of chance, and the red lemonade stand and by interesting this class of people to the extent that you get them to attend the fair may it not be hoped that in time they also may be brought to take an interest in the betterment of the object in view. In closing I will draw a picture of a certain class of people who may be brought to take an interest and yet get some benefit. When the grounds are all ablaze with red fire, as it were, and the merry-go-round and ferris wheel, as well as the various shows good and bad alike and the different games of chance and the hamburger and red lemonade stands are in full swing: I see unsophisticated Zeke grasp </seg>

Jackson: There is one gentleman I know we all mist tonight, a man who has attended every meeting I guess, since the Fair was or - ganized, a man we all learned to love. We miss him. I refer to Mr. Charles Mann. We have with us a gentleman from his section of the state, from Chadron, who will discuss this question, Mr. J. F. Lawrence. Lawrence: It is rather hard to say anything with an introduction which leads the thoughts directly back to Uncle Charlie Mann, be - cause I think his was as lovable a character as ever lived and while you men who were in touch with him only portions of the year have learned to love him and regard him most kindly, what must you think of us people up there who hfcve lived with him through all the years of struggle and trial. He acquired a little farm within a few miles of Chadron and finally succeeded, before his death, in building up a pretty little place in which to live, and seeing his three sons well es - tablished on farms of their own where they could rear their families and keep up the good work he had started, in building a home for him - self in this new neighborhood. It seems to me the influence of such a good soul as old Uncle Charlie Mann was is one that will live through countless years in any community and I thank you most kindly that you have been able to see in him in the short spaces of time he has been able to be with you, the good influence which we who lived with him year after year have been able to find. Now in regard to the county fair proposition I must tell you fel - lows you have put me up against a kind of hard proposition this evening, trom the simple fact I came here not expecting to say anything. It is the first time I have visited you and consequently am a little at a loss. It is like the story of Jim and Mike, two fellows who were going across a field one day and got into a pretty mix-up because a bull under - took to chase them. They went to the nearest place in the fence but found they were not going to make it. Right in the middle of the field was a ton and after the tree they went. Mike got up but Jim could not make it, but there was a welcome hole in the ground and into it Jim went. The bull scratched around and Jim came out of the hole, the bull came toward him again and into the hole he goes again, which he does about three times. Mike calls down, Jim what are you doing that for, you will have that bull so mad we will never get out of here. And Jim replies. Doggone you, there is a bear in that hole. I am at a loss to know what to say tonight. As to the matter of county fairs and the influence they will have on a community, there are </seg>
            <seg id="p076">76 FKK'EKDlMis NKRKAKKA STATE BOARD OF AGRUTI.TUBE three things a fair is supposed to do. In the first place you are to show what ability you have in the way of entertaining; you are to entertain your crowds that come there. Secondly, you have the educational fea - ture which I conceive is the greatest one and thirdly the advertising feature. Those three things are the definite objects of a county fair. Some people or some communities throw more stress on one of these than on the other, for instance, in our Dawes county fair in years past we have placed more stress on the entertainment. Three years ago when I took hold of the county fair I said it was all wrong, you see I was as bad as the other fellow. I said "it was all wrong, the educa - tional feature is the thing— build up your exhibits." As a consequence the entertainment feature of our fair has dropped off but the educa - tional exhibit has been built up, as witnessed by the fact we paid over twice as much in premiums this year as has ever been paid before. I have centered on that one thing, but have built it up to the detriment of the entertainment feature. Those three things are co-ordinate. In the first place you must have entertainments. I believ? Uncle Charlie Mann was always telling you about the Indians, that was one thing he was always talking about. We think we have the bast entertainment in the Indians that there is to be had, things you pay good money to see in a wild west show we have right at our back door and can bring them in. The entertainment feature is one thing you must consider because in our experience it has been the necessary thing to draw the crowds. You will not draw the crowds from the far off community and ad - joining towns unless you offer them something in the entertainment line. Our biggest entertainment was three shows of Indians and a company of soldiers who put on a musical drill. When we talked of getting an aeroplane they said it was stale, no good, they wanted some - thing new, something big. But now, coming back to the educational feature, this must include the country as well as the town people. These people know just as much as the children who are going to school; they have to be told what is best in the way of pumpkins, the best in the way of corn, potatoes. etc. The biggest potato is not the best, they find that out in bringing their exhibits to the county fair. A man will fill up a bushel basket with the biggest he has raised and then raise Cain because he does not get first prize on his potatoes. The same applies to corn, th_ - idea of the best corn is changing from what it was ten years ago. The best ear of corn is not the same shape it was. There are many things I might mention that are changing year in and yaar out, that must be taken up. The third proposition is the advertising feature, the thing you men are all talking about and thinking about in your own town and your own county. You want to see how big a display you can get, how many people you can get to your fair and then you want to tell about it. These three things are the ones I would like to impress upon you, and they are co-ordinate, there is not one that should be given more </seg>
            <seg id="p077">PK&lt;M EKU1.NGS NEBRASKA STATE BOAKD OF AGRH'l'LTl'RE 77 stress than another. You should have your work so divided that these three things will have equal importance; first, the entertainment fea - ture; second, the educational feature, and third, the advertising. I thank you. Jackson: Is there any further discussion on this question; we will be glad to hear from anyone. Sebastian: 1 am a delegate from Lincoln county, North Platte, my name is not on the program but the brother from Chadron making remarks in regard to county fair work reminds me of when I took the secretaryship of our Fair two years ago. In 1913 our county agricul - tural society was organized; in 1914 we had a hard struggle to get our people interested. We were put in Lincoln county which, to you people around Lincoln and Omaha, seems pretty far west, but we have forty-four precincts in our county and we feel we have a pretty good county. The one problem which confronted us was to get the people in the country interested in the county fair movement. The advertising feature, which the gentleman from Chadron spoke about, has been an awful weak proposition with us. The plan we adopted two years ago, which I will speak of because it might be helpful to some - one promoting a county fair in a western county, is this: We took the names from the tax list and wrote personal letters to all the tax - payers. That did not seem to give the results we expected; time was getting short, so we telephoned to something like twenty-five or thirty farmers in the different school districts and told them there was going to be a bunch of fellows from North Platte drive over in automobiles and we wanted as many people from that community as possible to meet us at the school house. There we got them enthused, and out of this school house meeting we held we had four precinct exhibits and people who came to the school house who ordinarily would not have brought anything to the fair. Some of those very fellows came to the fair and got away with first money and I want to tell you they had nice stuff. We followed up the same scheme last year and those who saw our 1915 exhibit at the State Fair realize that that is just the way we got it, by using the school house method. We expect to have a pretty hard struggle in 1916. Scottsbluff is pretty hard competition, but not - withstanding, w? are strong for western Nebraska, and I hope to meet you here next fall. Whitehead: Mr. Toastmaster, I want to ask the gentleman from Lincoln County for information (I am from Scotts Bluff County and am the strong competition he spoke of), I notice on their program last year they eliminated the racing feature. I would like to know how that af - fected their attendance. We go pretty strong on the racing. Sebastian: As a matter of fact we eliminated it because we were limited financially and did not have the chink and another thing, we did not have the race track. The city of North Platte has bought a twelve thousand dollar tract of land consisting of seventy-five acres on </seg>
            <seg id="p078">78 PROCEEDINGS .NEBRASKA STATE BOABD OF AGKICULTl'BE which to put a race track. If we come up to our expectations we are going to put up a pretty good show this year. Last year we had an aeroplane proposition. Captain Shaffer came and stayed three days rdid not get off the earth and the peopfe would like to have mobbed Our gate receipts were $1,640.00 and the people kept calling up at eleven and twelve o'clock at night and asking Mrs. Sebastian when the aeroplane was going to go up. I got a little wicked and put up a black - board on which I wrote: "I do not think the aeroplane is ever going to fly." The flying machine attraction is absolutely a failure. The best attraction we have in our town is auto polo and I think that is what we will have for our next attraction. Blackman: I would like to see this body go on record by sending a message of condolence to the family of Uncle Charlie Mann; I there - fore move we send a message of condolence, which is the best we can do. Carried by a rising vote. Jackson: The next question is very closely connected with the one we have just discussed: "What the Fair Does for a Community?" and next, "How It Does It." We have a gentleman here with whom I am personally acquainted in a business way, and in the Fair work, a man conducting a Fair I think in the smallest town in the state conducting a Fair. This is one of the youngest, organized, I think three years ago and it is one of the leading Fairs in the state today and gentlemen, you want to keep your eyes on the Fair down at Deshler, Mr. E. J. Mitchell of Deshler will discuss this question. Mitchell: Mr. Toastmaster, Ladies and gentlemen: How It Does It It is possible that some of us are a little like the captain. He is sure that "Hans and Fritz do it." He does not know how they do it, but he knows that they do it. The story of the Indian who always arose before the sun, and stood with kingly mein pointing out the road Old Sol was to travel for the day, is well known. We, who are enthusiasts on the Fair and what it does for the community, may give a little too much credit to the Fair as a profitable asset, and credit some improvements to the Fair, that might have Just "growed" liked Topsy, without any father or mother. When we were building our grandstand for the Thayer County Fair, an intelligent bystander remarked that it was all foolishness as we would never get people enough to fill it. It has a seating capacity of 1,200. When, that same fall it was filled to over - flowing and hundreds were unable to be accommodated, the same wise man said that it just happened that way. A perfect day and the people just happened to come to the Fair • • • but, it just happened again last year for three days, and this year we will probably double the ca - pacity of that grandstand. I might add here, that since writing this </seg>
            <seg id="p079">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTUIE 79 little extemporaneous address, our county commissioners have voted to give us an appropriation of $1,000 this year to be used in buildings, we having complied with every requirement of the law whereby this appro - priation may be obtained. When the directors of the Fair appeared be - fore that august body to request the appropriation, we were informed that we already had good buildings. We told them that while we had an electric lighted and city watered swine barn 32 x 60, that same barn was entirely inadequate last year, and at the present time every one of the pens were sold for the 1916 Fair and half the fees paid. We also re - minded them how hard they had to work to find a place in the grandstand and they agreed with us that we could use that thousand dollars to an advantage. The Fair benefits or hurts a community according to the way it Is managed. If it is allowed to run itself without careful attention, it is a positive detriment. If ably handled, it brings thousands of dollars into the community and provides work for many. It is educational as well as entertaining. Many a successful breeder of pure brsd stock and raiser of good seed products got his first ideas of these things from what he saw when a boy at the county Fair. The successful Fair brings the best school work, the best fancy work, the best cooking and preserving, and the best stock and farm products of the county together and shows the natives as well as visitors from a distance what the district can produce. An exhibitor remarked to me one day during our last Fair that if I had told him he would sell one of his best pure bred hogs to a man in Indiana by showing at our Fair, he would not have believed me, and yet that was just what he had done. Another exhibitor from a distance is trying to sell his farm and buy near Deshler in ordsr to be close to where he can show his pure bred horses, cattle, hogs, poultry and agri - cultural products. It is up to the people of the county, as to just "How It Does It." If the right community interest is taken, it benefits finan - cially, educationally, and socially. It broadens the vision, teaches us how to co-operate and boost and put our towns and county on the map, but it takes work and then more work. The results, however, ars strictly worth while. Jackson: We would be glad to hear from anyone else. Seybolt: I would like to have a little information. I am secre - tary from Morrill County and there are two points in particular that bother me and I would like to hear about. One is the entertainment feature, I would like to hear from some of the managers of the smaller Fairs. We have had two factions, one very strong for races and one lor ball games and others who do not think we should have either, but want something else. It seems to me that the races are a little the best of the two propositions but I would like to know how others handle this. The other thing is how they pick out judges, who 'really know anything about it especially in the agricultural line. Jackson: Will someone answer the question? </seg>
            <seg id="p080">nPCHSINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOABO OF AGBHTLTl RE 80 White: We are up against the proposition to know what kind of an entertainment to get good enough for our people, we have always had a good Fair, we have always given them a good entertainment, had good races and good shows, and a good many down there don't know what to do next. We have had our night entertainment ever since we have been conducting our Fair and we think it is one of the best financial proposi - tions of the Fair. If anyone here has anything that is good, I would like to hear it. I think racing is all right but one member of our Board has always stood pat against it. I believe in giving them a good racing pro- Member: How much money do you pay White: Our horse races cost us from $1,200.00 to $1,800.00 and our attractions $700.00 to $1,000.00 per year. Member: I would like to ask the Gentleman it' they charge two ad missions where they have a street fair inside the Fair grounds. White: Yes, we have our season tickets, $1.50 for the season. We have four days Fair and then single admission ticket is 50 cents. In the evening our admission is 25 cents. If you have a season ticket you can go in and out as many times as you wish but if you have just a single admission at 50 cants and you stay in the grounds it is good for all day and the evening but if you go out you would have to pay 25 cents to get back in the evening. We also have children's tickets at half fare. Jackson: Any more questions? Cheney: I will attempt, informally, to answer one question of our friend — in regard to the entertainment. There are two theories, one is to get professionals from a long way off and the other is to secure people who live near you. They may not do so well but the fact that they are known may help in adding to your entries and for two years we have tried out the proposition of having a football game between two high schools. All we have to pay them is their expenses, which is what they would get when they meet as between other high schools; that has cost us between $75.00 and $80.00 but we have found it to be very satisfactory. I do not know how long it will last, the next time it might not be a success but it h&amp;s for the past two years, so that is one suggestion in regard to the theory of taking an entertainment which is near you and keeping the money at home. The baseball entertainment is along the same lines, we in the west - ern end of the state have tried that to a point where it is getting a little old and it is not so satisfactory so we have switched to the football game although we still retain the baseball game for other days, bringing the teams from the adjoining villages. One other point, as to your judges, I believe you asked about that Ask Professor Pugsley, he has them by the dozen, you can get all kinds of judges for all kinds of things and you will get good ones, too.

We had Professor Little a year or two and we had a man who had been at Ames a year. We tried to get Colonel Leonard to come out last year and he promised us faithfully he would and I told the boys what we could depend on but unfortunately he promised someone else before us so we were disappointed and had to secure someone else. However we had no trouble in securing a competent judge and I believe the expert judge is what you need. It is something that gives confidence the people who exhibit Jackson: If there is nothing more on this we will take up the next, subject. I know we will all be interested in knowing how to run a Fair free; we have a man with us from the "state of Omaha" who will speak on this question and, by the way, be was the first president of this or- un/.utioM I be!ieve, and probably a gentleman who has done as much &gt;r the State Board of Agriculture as any other one man. I refer to Mr. G. W. Hervey of Omaha. Hervey: Mr. Chairman and Members of the Nebraska Fairs' Asso - ciation: I am not surprised that this topic tonight has proved to be such a joke and it is scarcely worth while for me to attempt to apologize for being here seemingly to endorse the free county Fair. Mr. Smith, the Secretary, and I started out on the proposition of getting the Fairs in Nebraska together and we b.'came quite sympathetic and interested in ach other. I received a little note from Mr. Smith a while ago asking if I would discuss this subject. "The Free County Fair" and without any consideration whatever I said I would. I wanted to accommodate Mr. Smith and relieve him of anxiety in hunting up anyone else. 1 did not think anything more about it for a while until it was called to my atten - tion and the more I thought about it the more J was satisfied I did not know anything about it. The next trouble was to get help of any kind that would be reliable authority and I got a little relief by going away down to Oklahoma. I have got this in one of those extemporane - ous speeches. The Free County Fair This subject has been receiving considerable attention for some time both locally and generally. I believe in the county Fair, I believe in the township Fair, I believe in farmers' institute Fair, I believe in the smaller community Fair, even if it is of organization boundary no larger than the school district. I believe in making all these Fairs free and cl;ar. exempt from personal advantage or money influence in the matter of perfect freedom to the grounds where the Fair is being held. If it is a good thing for the man and woman, the boy and girl, who are interested and come to see, study, compare and learn from the standpoint of exhibition or that of casual observer or sightseer, it is good for idle, careless, indif- </seg>

There is more or less prejudice on the part of some persons against those who operate or supervise public enterprise? where there is position and compensation involved. The free pass the free admission from some source or other Is a matter of contention, a matter of prejudice against many local Fair organizations. It keeps down ambition to co - operate, to help, to join in community enterprise, to engage in friendly contest, to become an active progressive leader in the community. The free Fair will to a very large extent remove these prejudices. I assume that the properly conducted Fair does result in increased production. If this is true, then increased production results in increased taxable values. If increased taxable values are the result of increased production, which is the effect or result of the teachings of the township or county Fair, then this fair may very properly claim the support of taxa - tion for its maintenance, in whole or in part, as it has been ths means of creating this increased wealth. This I claim as (he basis of argument in justice of taxation for maintenance of the free Fair. I have prepared a short summary of the Oklahoma free fair law. Oklahoma, I believe, has satisfactorily solved this question of the free county and township Fair. In this state their new law governing the county Fair, provides for a county Fair association composed of two members from each township in the county. These members shall be elected every two years by the citizens of their respective townships at a meeting held in the township on a specified date fixed by law. A cer - tificate of election is given the successful candidates by the Chairman and Secretary of this meeting which is taken to the Chairman of th ■ County Commissioner who records their certificates of election. Monday of the next week, the elected members of the various townships meet at the county seat and proceed to elect from their number a President, the Secretary is chosen from outside the association and at this meeting they elect from their members a board of five directors. These, with the President, constitute the board of Fair managers who proceed to plan, arrange and hold a county Fair, drawing such assistance as they need in the work from the members of the Fair association. The Board of Managers makes a classified estimate of the amount of funds they will need for holding the Fair. This request goes before the County Commis - sioners prior to their annual meeting for the making of tax levies. The County Excise Board may in their discretion levy not to exceed % of a mill upon the total valuation of the county in which the fair is held, for free fair purposes, on the estimate made by the Fair Board. The county treasurer shall collect and apportion moneys for the county free-fair, as other moneys are collected and apportioned, and </seg>
            <seg id="p083">1-KiK KKDl.XUS NKBBASKA STATE BOARD OF AQBICULTUBE ■ disburse the same upon vouchers issued by the executive board of fair managers having the endorsement of the President and Secretary. The executive board shall have exclusive right to all concessions, stand-rights and privileges of all kinds at the township and county fairs; and admission may bs charged to races of all kinds, horse shows or any other special amusements; provided that no money appropriated under this act or law is ussd to defray any expenses or costs of such races or amusements; and further that charging admission to such amusements does not interfere with free access of the public to all exhibits of the fair or receiving support from the county appropria - tion. The free fair applies to the matter of exhibits entirely. It applies to the outside admission onto the fair grounds, and such free exhibitions and amusements as the Board of Managers may direct. PULLING THE COUNTY AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY OUT OF THE OLD RUT The greatest difficulty that the county fair has to contend with generally is in getting properly and satisfactorily organized at the start. Where there are factions and dissentions born with the fair, created in its first organization, and carried down through an out of balance or unfair representation of the public interests of the county, there can never be a success attained, to the extent that the people of the county are entitled to, until a reorganization is effected. After canvassing practically every basis for county fair organizations, there is nothing that appeals to us as a safer and more equitable basis for county fair organization, than by precinct of township representation. This would call for as many members of the fair board as there are townships in the county. Each township selecting its representative for the board by nomina - tion, to be sent up to the annual meeting and election of directors. Thus, each division or district in the county would have its delegate or representative, and be responsible for the quality of person they selected. This would be a stimulus to the general qualifications and character of the county fair, and break down all prejudice of one section of the county trying to get advantage of another; unity of purpose and unity of action in the promotion of the agricultural interests of the whole county, upon a basis of equal representation is the bulwark of success in the building of the agricultural fair. I believe that the most successful system of county fair organization is by annual membership, making any person who has been a resident of the county for six months prior to the holding of the fair eligible to membership upon the payment of one dollar. This one dollar membership fee shall thereafter be an annual assess - ment upon each member, and in order that each member be entitled to </seg>
            <seg id="p084">84 PROCEEDINGS NEBZASKA STATE BO ABU OF AGEICt'LTlTBE vote at the election of officers at the annual meeting held on a certain date, a renewal of membership must be established by the payment of one dollar by the member at said annual meeting. The date of the annual meeting shall be recognized as the beginning of the fair year with ths County Agricultural Society. This system of renewal of mem - bership each year keeps a live, active, interested membership. Persons who are not interested can drop out and the fair spirit of the society or association can be freshened up by new mat 'rial, a portion of which will become interested and active workers. There cannot be too much stress put on the importance of linking and moulding together of mutual interests and responsibilities of fair mem - bers, fair managers, and exhibitors in the success of the fair. Every person holding a membership certificate in the agricultural society should be admitted to the annual fair as a stockholder or member, free of charge, during its continuance; and all exhibitors making a speci - fied number of entries under the regular classification of the premium list, should receive an exhibitor's ticket to the fair, free of charge. If this exhibitor is a stockholder or member of the agricultural society, then his entry admission to be made out to one of his family, or as h? directs. The object in this system of admission is to enlist the sympathy and interest of all who are interested in agricultural improvement in the community where the fair is being he'd and thus strengthen the fair support and fair work with people who make the fair. It is a wrong idea to have a fair management so constituted as to encourage the prejudice of the people against it. by the common be - lief that the managers or board of directors are enjoying all the privileges of the organization; that they are occupying positions of profit and are selfish inAheir management of the affairs of the society and lair. The facts are that the man who goes on a board of fair managers and performs his duty earns more than he gets; in other words, if he has any business to attend to at home, he is a loser financially during his period of fair management. But public opinion does not give the matter this charitable and reasonable view. One of the most important features in organization of the agricul - tural society is the officering of it. The success or failure in a great measure depends upon the men who are put at the head of it to look after and manage its affairs. There shou'.d be more interest takeu in the agricultural society by the common farmer. The time to prepare for the annual show is before the annual election of officers, by selecting a number of the best men in the county to be offered at the meeting as candidates to fill the official positions. It is bad management to wait until time to commence to prepare for the annual fair and then dis - cover that careless and incompetent men have been placed in active, re - sponsible positions and the interests of -the county and society are made to suffer from a carelessness on the part of the membership, in not turning out at the annual meeting for the election of officers and </seg>

One of the greatest mistakes common to such organizations is the selection of persons to fill those official positions, because they are idle, not got much on hand, plenty of time to devote to such work, etc. Our observation and experience has taught us that nine times out of ten such men are not fit for the position tendered thsm. A gentleman of leisure, an idler, an old fogy, or an old worn-out man is not suited to the work of planning, arranging or managing an agricultural exhibit. There are a few exceptions, but as a general rule, the continuance of such men in office tends to flatten out and deaden the agricultural interests of a county, that the agricultural society was designed to stimu - late and develop into a degree of excellence, that can never be had by any other incentive. It is highly important for the success and well being of the agricul - tural interests of a county that the young men be invited into the ranks, not only to hold memberships in the county agricultural society but to take hold and learn the official management. There is nothing so potent as young blood. Introduce it into the county agricultural societies by giving those young farmers important official positions. We need more vim and energy at the head of every department of agriculture and no better schooling can be offered than to encourage the boys to become exhibitors, then members, and as soon as they develop a d.s - position and fitness for exhibition work, put them on the society board of directors; this is one of the feasible means at hand of pulling the agricultural society out of the old rut, into which it has fallen. When we say the agricultural society we speak in general terms, applying to agricultural societies in general wherever the progressive spirit does not exist Jackson: We would be glad to hear from Mr. McKelvie. McKelvie: Mr. Speaker, Members of this Organization and Friends I was sitting here feeling very much like the description given of Jonah by Chauncey Depew. Tbe story goes that Chauncey Depew was passing through a fine art gallery with a young lady and they were looking at the paintings. Among them was one depicting Jonah as he was about to be swallowed by the whale, and he seemed to have a very complacent and contented look on his face. The young lady said: "Senator Depew, it seems strange that Jonah, knowing he is about to be swallowed, should look so comfortable and contented. Sen - ator Depew said : ' I do not know that there is anything strange about it, when the banquet is over he knows he will not be called upon to make a speech." In being called upon thus unexpectedly I am like the colored fellow in Arkansas who had some money in the bank; the bank busted and he lost all his money and he was bewailing his fate to a friend of his. His </seg>
            <seg id="p086">86 PROCEEDINGS NEBBA8KA STATE BOARD OF AORlCULTlKfc friend, in an attempt to console him, said: "Don't fael so badly about it, banks have busted before." "Yes, 1 know, but this is the first time 1 ever had one bust right in my face." I ought to be able to talk very glibly and intelligently on this subject because I have given it no thought whatever and have had no experience whatever. Mr. Hervey seems to have covered the subject quite thoroughly, but at least in order to make believe I know something about it and arouse interest, I am obliged to take the opposite side of the question. I doubt the practica - bility of the free county fair, first on the basis that the thing which is free is usually deemed to be worth what it cost, and I do not believe the attendance at county fairs will be largely increased through free admission. The expenditure of the amount necessary to see a fair is not, in my opinion, the element that causes people to stay away. There are several causes which contribute more to it. There are some lo - calities in which it seems to be difficult to arouse interest in public events of such kind, and there are other communities in which there is a spirit of public interest that causes people to join in making a county fair as well as other events, a success. Throughout Nebraska we find that condition. 1 should favor free admission to county fairs or other exhibitions of an educational nature for school children; I believe they will come and they should, by every means, be induced to come. Fres admission for school children will bring out the older people, in fact, whatever increased interest is given in exhibits and other things that tend to bring out the young people invariably brings out a large attend - ance of the older people of a community. There is a phase of the free county fair which will be discussed very considerably by the people when it finally becomes an issue and that is the question of taxation. The support of the county fair as a free in - stitution must be distributed throughout the entire county and the cost assessed upon the property throughout the county. Access to the fair has something to do with the extent to which people can patronize it. those located close to it have an advantage over those who have to come from a distance, though they have to pay an equal amount for the support of the fair. That feature, it seems to me, would make an unfair distribution of the cost of maintenance. The town in which the fair is held has the advantage over other towns in the county. The merchants of that town have an advantage in that they will obtain, as a result of the fair, the patronage which the other towns will be deprived of. So to my way of looking at it, it seems only just that towns near the fair should contribute more to its support than other towns in the county, and I believe those merchants are glad to do it. As I said before, it is my belief that it is not the amount of admission which causes people to stay away from the fair, but lack of interest in the enterprise and it is for that very reason you are assembled here tonight — to discuss ways and means by which you can increase interest and resultant patronage for your county fairs. I thank you. </seg>
            <seg id="p087">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 87 Jackson: We have with us this evening a gentleman from Iowa, a man I understand, until recently, has been a member of the State Board of Agriculture of Iowa, Mr. L. H. Pickard, and we would like to hear from him on any subject on which he will talk. Pickard: Mr. Chairman and Fellow Fair Managers: I hardly know what I would be expected to talk about. There are some things we see and I will give a little experience. I came from Omaha on the street car and it was pretty well crowded. A gantleman came in and was hanging to the strap, the car gave a lurch and he fell into a lady's lap. She indignantly pushed him off and said, "What kind of a man are you?" "Well," he said, "I came in here an Irishman, but now I am a Lap - lander." Another man came into the car who was a little intoxicated; I sup - pose he crossed the river from Iowa into Nebraska. He was banging to the strap when the car gave another lurch and he landed in the lady's lap. She indignantly pushed him off and said: "You afe a pretty looking man to go home to your family. Do you know what I would do if you were my husband. I would give you poison, I would." He looked up at her and said, "Madam, if you were my wife, I would take it." A very large man was sitting in the ssat with a boy next to him when a couple of nice looking young ladies came in. The man nudged the boy and said : "Get up and give one of those ladies your seat," and the boy replied, "You get up and give them both a seat." Now, of course there are a good many things that transpire that have to be considered, especially in an age of fairs. In our state the railroads are prohibited from carrying a public drinking cup; you can take your individual cups, go to the cooler and drink what you please and then go back and sit in a seat a tuberculosis patient has just va - cated. And when night comes you slesp in a berth the same patient has occupied the night before, knowing you have complied with the re - quirements of the sanitary law. In fact, a business man going to his business early in the morning kisses his wife through a plate glass door; that door has to be sterilized after each kiss and a young man going to see his best girl in the evening cannot give her a kiss without knowing that that kiss has been thoroughly sterilized and has the stamp of ap - proval of the State Board of Health. Down in Kansas a year ago they actually had a bill before the House, I don't know whether it was passed or not, but it was something like this: A bill prohibiting a girl from curl - ing her hair or using either paint or powder. They claimed there were too many young men dying from painter's colic. A little girl had an invitation to a 6 o'clock dinner. Her mother naturally gave her a few instructions in regard to table etiquette. When she got home her mother asked her how she got along. "Mother, I do not know, when the lady passed the pie I took it and ate it and said to her, 'that is very good pie, indeed.' " The lady said, 'Will you have another piece?" and I said, "No, I thank you, I have had one piece." </seg>
            <seg id="p088">88 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE "But you must have another." So I took another and remarked it was very nice pie indeed." The lady passed it to me a third time, and mother, you did not tell me what to say when it was passed the third time." ' We'.l, daughter, what did you say?" "I said what papa always says. Take the "damn thing away." In regard to running fairs it reminds me a little bit. at one of our annual meetings of the State Fair we had a gentleman from New York, I think he was the editor of the "Rural New York." In his preliminary remarks he said, "Well, gentlemen, I have no speech. I had a speech when I started from New York, but had not been out but a little whil ■ when I found you young people knew more about farming than we ever knew. I am going to tell you how we farm. Among othar things he told of a couple of little boys who lived five or six miles from town. There was a show in the town and their mother had promised them they could go. When the morning came the boys dressed up and the mother gave them two cents each. The boys walked into town and were feehng pretty good when they got there. They got two cents worth of crack srs, went out and ate those and took in the free attractions. Along about 3 o'clock they began to get hungry again, so they invested the other two cents in more crackers. They went out and sat down in the shade and one of the boys said to the other: "John, what do you suppose mother would say if she knew the time we were having " The grandson of one of those boys gave a banquet in California a short time ago that cost him just one thousand dollars; the difference there is in boys. But he told us a good many interesting stories as to the way they farmsd. In regard to running fairs, about the only thing I can say perhaps is to tell you how we run ours. We were speaking about tickets; we never have a ticket at the gate that is good for more than one admis - sion. We change the color of our tickets every day; the color we have today is something else tomorrow. At one end of our season tickets we have 1-2-3-4, according to the number of days we hold our fair. That ticket is good at the gate in the morning or the first time in. If it is the second day we punch numbsr two; that ticket is not good again that day unless he has the pass check. If he wants to go out and come back again he can do so as many times as he likes, but he must secure a pass check to present with his season ticket. These pass checks are the same color as those for that day so he cannot misuse them. I notice one thing, a great many people will take advantage of a fair or railroad company if they can. One could gather up two or three of those tickets and pass them to two or three of his friends, but by this method we have a chack on him so he absolutely cannot do it. Last year we only held two days fair. We were rained out. In regard to attractions, we thought our baby health contest was a great attraction. We had something over ninety babies at the fair. Nsxt year we will open it to the world and you people in Nebraska can bring your babies. Of course the mothers, have to come with tb» </seg>
            <seg id="p089">■ PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOABD OF AGRICULTURE babies, and of course someone has to bring the mother, and as a con - sequence, we generally get the whole family. We also have a spelling contest which interests the children from the eighth grade and down. Before the schools are out the first part of June we send a free admission ticket to the teachers for the day on which we hold the spelling contest. Each school in the county holds a spelling contest and the five winners go to the township spelling contest and the five who win there go to the county fair. We give pretty good premiums. At the time we sand out these tickets we send out children's tickets, any number of them. We admit all the children twelve years or under anyway, but we send out tickets to be distributed to the school so every child under twelve has a ticket. As a matter of fact, the child who has a ticket is going to come to the fair and the rest have to come with it. The contest is creating quite an interest. This method reaches every child and teacher in the county and has been very success - ful in drawing out the people. In regard to attractions, that depends, I think, upon the locality. You will have to find something that will amuse the people. There is always something new such as auto polo; that is a good attraction. We put this on last year and also had a night attraction. We gave them fireworks, very fine, which we considered very good for a county fair. We had a good program and the people turned out very well. I think we will continue it next year with the exception that next year we will hold a longer fair, instead of three days we will hold it about six; that is, you understand, we start in on Saturday, which is entry day. On Sunday we put on a chautauqua program suited to the day with a sacred concert, and some noted speaker. We did have our United States Senator and had contracted for Booker T. Washington, but death beat us to it. We had Senator Kenyon and are looking for some other speaker. We want to get the best speaker in the United States for that Sunday so we can draw a big crowd. The only chance we take is in regard to the day. If it is a good day and good roads the people will come. Thece are no threshing machines running and no one is working. There is a chautauqua which is held a week or more with a good attendance every day, so we concluded to make this a good program. You cannot. get too good a one. One trouble is that we find something cheap; we should not look at this but should try and get the best. In concessions, of course, there is more tendency toward bootlegging and other things which the law prohibits with us than with you people here. We cannot allow any gambling on the grounds, if we do we lose our state appropriation. This year we had a detective and on the night of the first day we had nine in jail, but after that everything went nicely and I do not think we will be bothered with that any more. But you want good, clean attractions. Of course, as I said before, it de - pends largely upon the locality as to what attractions you can put on. If we were all educated up to a certain standard it would be easy to get </seg>
            <seg id="p090">90 PROCEEDINGS NEBBASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE attractions, but what suits one does not suit another. For instance, they were having a church meeting and the deacons were all there but they did not agree on some things. One brother got up and said: "Brother So-and-So, 1 am very glad we are not all of the same opinion; if they were all like me they would all want my woman." "Yes, I am very glad we are not all alike; if all were like me no one would have her." So you have to have different attractions or what we call a well balanced fair in order to make everybody feel they are interested. This year we had an attraction at our fair that took quite well, a pole act. The man runs up the pole like a squirrel and performs feats upon it. He goes clear to the top — 110 feet. He balances himself right on the point and goes through a swimming act, kicks with his feet; it is a very nice attraction and probably something new. You want some - thing you have not had. I think it advisable to change your programs every day. We had a tug-of-war which is a drawing card and by the way, you have a good team here in your state, at Omaha, the Danish Brotherhood. They had a contest last week and they have never been beaten. We are planning to put on a tug of war, and if we succeed we will challenge the Omaha team and take our best men. Of course we do not expact to win, but it will be quite interesting. We have had, this year, since the fair, a horseshoe tournament, and the town was full. 1 happened to be away at that time but they had a good crowd. They wanted to come in and hold their tournament during the fair. That of course, is something new, but it will draw a certain class of people who might not come otherwise. I do not think I can give you people in Nebraska any pointers as to running a fair, as you seem to be pretty well posted as I judged from attending your meeting today. Your state is very generous in giving you an appropriation. As a matter of fact all your secretaries ought to be wearing diamonds. It is far better than we get in Iowa. Jackson: If thers is nothing further, I see Professor Condra is here ready to conduct his part of the program. Dr. George E. Condra of the Nebraska State Conservation Commis - sion, showed several reels of Nebraska, in which was included one of the Nebraska State Fair dims, explained by W. R. Mellor. At the conclusion of this part of the program Mr. Riesen moved that a vote of thanks be extended to Dr. Condra for his part of the program, which was carried unanimously. Mr. Jackson' called the meeting to order for the reading of the Secre - tary's report and the election of oncers. Smith: The Secretary has a very brief report to make. A year ago we had on hand a balance of $26.90. We still have on hand about $14.00 of that money.

            <seg id="p092">92 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON LIVE STOCK Gentlemen: It is with much pleasure we are able to report that in the past year Nebraska Live Stock interests have in a general way been quite satisfactory to those identified with this chief industry. While conditions in many parts of the country caused by the foot and mouth disease has cost the Live Stock men of this country millions of dollars, Nebraska happily has during this period remained free from this blight - ing scourge, which now appears to be under control and business is again taking on normal conditions. A meeting of considerable importance to Live Stock men was held in Chicago in the month of December called by the Secretary of Agricul - ture at Washington, D. C, to take up the perplexing problems confronting these interests at the present time, this meeting was largely attended by men vitally interested from all parts of the United States. J. A. Ollis and Chas. Graff represented the Nebraska Live Stock Breeders' Associa - tion at said meeting. All the Allied Live Stock interests were well rep - resented at this conference, men from all parts of the United States being present and taking an active part in the discussions. Mr. Carl Vrooman, Assistant Secretary of Agriculture, who presided over the meeting was much complimented by the Stockmen present for the fair and impartial way he conducted said meeting and contended from the start that the Farmer and Stockman was entitled to first con - sideration. At this meeting the interests of Live Stock were discussed in its many phases, particularly sanitary methods and interstate shipments of Live Stock. It was not difficult to notice that the two problems of sanitation and interstate shipments among the Farmers and Breeders on Live Stock is far from satisfactory, being faulty in many ways. Under exist - ing rules and regulations we find that one state has this set of rules and another state that, and when taken into consideration that these rules are being continually, "or at least can be" changed no one knows at any time what the requirements are, or may be, in order to get an animal from one state to another. We find that printed rules by the different states are of little use for the reasons mentioned above.

OLLI8, REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON HORTICULTURE HORTICULTURE IN NEBRASKA IN 1915 FRUIT GROWING Apples The apple crop of 1915 was larger than for the past three years, but not as large as some crops of former years. The loss of trees in the past five years, caused by dry weather, has cut down the total number of bearing trees about one-half of what it formerly amounted to. The figures gathered by the State Board of Agriculture in 1914 were 1,430,044 bearing trees. The figures in 1910 were in round numbers 2,800,000. The crop for 1915 has been estimated at various figures, but a conservative estimate based upon the actual number of trees in bearing would be two and one-half million bushels. This includes 'summer, fall and winter fruit, and the product of both commercial and home orchards. The weather conditions this season have been exceedingly bad for the proper application of sprays in order to successfully combat the fungus troubles.

This made it hard to get the necessary pruning and cleaning up done in the late winter months when it is customary to do these things. All this work was left until the time for spring work. This caused the grower to neglect some things. It caused many of them to be late in putting on their sprays. Others thought they had no scab in their orchards and needed no fungus sprays. Some thought they did not need to spray at all. These all had a rude awakening. While we had a large crop of good sized fruit, it was of a poor marketable quality, because of almost universal infection from -scab. A few growers by a thorough application at the right time, and using plenty of material and pressure in applying same, grew a crop of clean fruit that graded up well and brought a good price. The price of apples, generally speaking, throughout the state was low. This was because of the poor quality of the fruit, which necessitated its being put upon the market as soon as possible after picking. This meant glutted markets of poor fruit and a low price. The good fruit did not go begging and sold readily at a good price. The marketing conditions the past fall emphasize two things: Closer cooperation between the grower in producing and marketing their crops, and the growing of the best quality of fruit and rigid grading and packing of that fruit before it is placed upon the market. The past spring saw a number of large commercial orchards being planted in the Missouri River territory. The spring and summer were ideal for setting out and starting a young orchard. Where proper care was taken in planting the young trees and good stock was secured to plant, a perfect stand and a growth of from twenty to forty inches for the season resulted. The old orchards of the state that had almost suc - cumbed to the attacks of disease and drouth were given a new lease oi life by the wet weather of the past year. All in all the outlook for commercial orcharding in Nebraska, where commercial orchards can l&gt;. - grown, was never better. The fanner who will set out a home onuard and give it the same relative care as he does his corn has never had a better opportunity for growing a paying orchard than now. The outlook for apple growing in Nebraska was never brighter than at present, if the grower is willing to profit by the lessons tauK~.it this season. Well grown, well graded, well packed Nebraska apples will al - ways command a top price upon the market. Pear* Pears were, generally speaking, a light crop in the eastern part of the state. Individual trees were in some cases heavily loaded, but the commercial pear orchards did not have as large a crop as in 1914. Cherries There was a fair crop of cherries of excellent quality and size </seg>
            <seg id="p095">95 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOAJtD OF AGRICULTURE Peaches As a commercial crop peaches were a failure. A few places report some peaches, but as most of the commercial peach orchards are dead or nearly so, we cannot expect to get any peach crop of consequence until more orchards are set. Peach growing, except in the extreme south - eastern portion, is a gamble as to securing crops of fruit. Plums Plums were generally light over the state. What were produced were of good size and good quality. The Americana varieties do well rll over the state. The late spring frosts damaged them somewhat this pa-it spring. Grape* Grapes are commencing to be one of the large commercial crop3 of the Missouri River Valley territory. Several thousand vines were set out into commercial vineyards this season. Better care is being given the vineyards already in bearing and the fruit is being placed upon the market in better shape, being more rigidly graded and packed. The weather conditions at blooming time were unfavorable to proper fertilization of the blooms and as a consequence the bunches were irregularly filled. This made ragged buncnes aid reduced the yield in pounds per vine. However, a good crop was marketed and was sold at from fair to good prices. The eastern part of the state offers the best opportunities in the production of high quality grapes of any section of the United States, where the American varieties of grapes are grown. Small Fruits Strawberries are the most important of the small fruits in Nebraska. Florence, in Douglas county, and Brownville, in Nemaha county, are two centers where strawberry growing is engaged in extensively. Early in the spring the fields gave promise of an abundant harvest, and the crop came on in' good shape, but during the picking season the excessive rain - fall caused considerable loss. The berries were soft and did not siand up well in shipment, A large amount were canned by the local canning plants. The prices received were good. Raspberries were generally a good crop, as were also blackberries. The wet season was favorable to producing a heavy yield ef large luscious blackberries. These fruits are not grown on an extensive scale for commercial purposes. A growing demand at good prices affords a good opportunity for the planting of more raspberries. Floriculture and Ornamental Gardening The season has been an excellent one for the growth of all kinds of flowers, and ornamental shrubs, roses and perennials. More interest is </seg>

The farui«f of the state his reached the point where he can afford some of the luxuries, such as a modern home and he wants that home placed in an attractive surrounding of trees, flowers and shrubs REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON POULTRY The raising of poultry in the state, during the past year, was a diffi - cult matter owing to the great amount of rainfall, as many farmers and poultrymen are not equipped with good, dry coops for the mother hen and chicks, or a suitable place for the brooder. The mother hen and her chicks must have ample room to keep on the go most of the time: if they are cooped in such a manner that they will have to mope around most of the day you can make up your mind you will not raise very many chicks from the brood, what you do raise will be very weak and of little value for any purpose. To raise good, strong, vigorous birds hatch them from eggs that have been layed by good, healthy stock and then arrange brood coops not affected by either wet or dry, and with ample room for all the exercise they can take. Nothing makes bone and muscle like exercise. We do not consider the kind of feed given them of as much value, but it is how we give it to them. We all can profit by Nature's way of feeding the wild birds, and when we follow as near as possible tl&gt;at manner of feeding we will have better success with our chicks. We believe that most of our trouble comes from improper f°edinK. both with chicks and parent stock. We think there are too many different breeds of poultry of little value as a commercial fowl. What the farmer wants are eggs and meat and there are many good breeds for such purposes. Many of the highly boosted breeds are of little value in this respect, "some of them are good to look upon and that is about all." Select some good sized bird. one that will produce bpth eggs and meat and then stick to that breed until fully conversant with their needs. Such a course will brini; better returns from the flock of poultry. Another place where the average, poultryman is weak is not being prepared for the cold weather; there is no excuse for unpreparvduess. we get cold weather every winter, yet year after year our birds are PETER YOUNGERS, C.

Prepare for cold weather next year before it gets here even if it comes early in November.

Try to raise twice the amount of poultry the coming year, and be one to profit thereby. WILLIAM FOSTER, J. F. McARDLE, J. E. RYAN, A. H. SMITH, U. G. MUNSON, Committee. REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON RURAL AND AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION To the President, Secretary and Board of Managers of the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture: As members of the committee on rural education we realize that the afety of our democracy lies in the intelligent education of its people. We affirm our belief and loyalty in those present day educational move - ments of our state and nation whose purpose it is to promote an educa - tional system that will fit the individual to cope with the environment of which he is so vital a factor. A few days ago a commercial teacher in one of our higher institutions of learning in an address before a company of business men gave this definition of education: "Education is merely the taking of knowledge of the past and transmitting it to the present generation." This is both a conservative and popular conception of education. It is at the same time erroneous and out of harmony with the trend of modern educational research. Today, we have come to realize that education is not merely the accumulation of a stock of traditional knowledge for possible use later in life, but that it is the living of life and life experience as we go along. Education, unrelated to environment is bookish and ineffective; education tied up with rich experiences of life will prove effective any - where. Today we realize that culture is control and control of Itself is education. The old idea of education was to tell the child what to do; </seg>

UK I 1. 1 I 1:1 the new idea is the harmonious development of all the powers of the individual in such a way that the individual can make his own decisions. At the present time the whole country is keenly alive to the collec - tion of problems which include land ownership and tenantry, rural social life, the country women problem, the rural church and education. All of these problems when taken together constitute the so-called rural prob - lem. The rural school problem is only one phase of this .great rural un - rest and to understand it we must see it in its proper setting. How to reduce farm tenantry and increase rural home builders: how to make possible country homes, how to improve the farm and its people are the fundamental needs of rural life today. As was stated earlier, education to be effective must be associated with environment. If the school is to be a vital force in its community, it must shape its instruction to serve the needs of its people. We are in hearty accord with all organizations that have for their purpose the betterment and general uplift of rural life, and we would urge that educators lend their co-operation and influence to all move - ments concerned with the great rural problem. We believe that there is a great need of public awakening along the lines of sanitation and health. The recent survey directed by Or. T 1) Wood of Columbia University has brought forth results showing, that in the localities where the investigations were carried on. the children from the city were healthier than those from the country. We, therefore, ap prove of school plants that represent the perfection of the builder's arl with reference to location, ventilation, lighting, heat a arrangement and form of desks We further approve of a nation-widt campaign for general sanitation of homes and barn yards, for fresh aii and cleanliness and against improper diet and intemperance. We believe an effort should be made towards the estal agriculture, manual training and domestic science as soon as in our rural schools. We feel that there should be an organization of the bfst available material bearing upon the child's physical and industrial environment This should be accomplished by school supervisors with a view of making such material accessible to both teacher and pupils. We heartily commend the last legislature for its auion in establishing courses in rural education in the normal schools of our state. To meet these new demands for rural education a new training must be supplied for the rural teacher of the future. We are in hearty accord with Secretary Lane's recommendations for the betterment of rural schools, and with our state department of educa - tion in its effort in urging the standardization and consolidation of the rural schools of Nebraska.

REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURAL EXTEN8ION The first appropriation tor Agricultural Extension work was made for carrying on Farmers' Institutes for the biennluni of 1897-99 and amounted to $3,000. Until the year 1906, practically all of the work was farmers' institute work. After that extension schools and boys' and girls' clubs were put in as a part of the extension work. The first extension school was held in Pawnee county during the winter of 1906-07. In September of 1911 the title of the department having the extension work in charge </seg>
            <seg id="p100">100 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE was changed from Farmers' Institute Department to Agricultural Exten - sion Department with a superintendent in charge. In 1914 the title was again changed to Extension Service of the College of Agriculture with a director in charge. In 1915 the state legislature passed and the governor signed a law which accepted the provisions of the Smith-Lever Act. The Extension Service is organized coordinate with the Experiment Station as a part of the College of Agriculture. The Service itself is divided into departments or divisions with an executive officer in charge of each. At present the divisions comprise the following: County Agents, Boys' and Girls' Clubs, Home Economics, Publicity Movable Schools and Special Meetings. The Extension Service bears the same relation to the College as does the Experiment Station, and the College is organized as a part of the University. A close cooperative relationship exists between the State Board of Agriculture, the State Horticultural Society, the State Depart - ment of Public Instruction, and other state departments and societies, not by law, but by agreement. County Associations, known as County Farmers' Associations, taking part in the direction of the county agent work, cooperate with the Extension Service, and there are also farmers' institute associations and other local organizations which cooperate with the Service. The revenue for the extension work comes from four sources, (1) Smith-Lever, (2) State Appropriations, (3) U. S. Department of Agri - culture, (4) Local Contributions. The use of the Smith-Lever money is limited by terms of the- Smith-Lever Act. That portion of the state money which offsets Smith-Lever funds is limited by the same act. The state money is appropriated for agricultural extension work including Farmers' Institutes. U. S. Department of Agriculture money is limited by project agreements and the local money is raised for special extension work in special communities. The Extension Division is housed in Agricultural Hall at University Farm, which building also contains the administration offices of the Col - lege, Station and School of Agriculture, as well as the library and some class rooms. A total of thirty-six extension bulletins have been published. Circu - lars and leaflets from the various divisions have been printed as occa - sion has demanded. Extension specialists, or persons especially pre - pared to write material for bulletins, circulars and leaflets make prepar - ation of the material. The material is distributed upon special re - quest and to a mailing list which is kept at the college. The work of the Extension Service in all its departments is put on a project basis.

REPORT OF WORK BY DEPARTMENTS County Agent Work 1915 Eight counties have carried on the county agricultural agent work during 1915. Those counties, together with the county agents are as follows: In addition eight counties have temporary farmers' associations formed for the purpose of undertaking county agricultural agent work as soon as the counties can be properly organized. These temporary associations were formed this year, or have been In effect previous this year. Four other counties this year have started a movement organize for conducting county agent work. Hog Cholera Control Practically all of the county agents took up the project of hog cholera control as the leading feature in their work. They have vaccinated over 12,000 hogs in the effort made to control and eradicate the disease. In all but two instances the county agents have succeeded in confining the disease on the place where it first appeared. By quick action and by community cooperation they have succeeded in isolating the outbreaks, cleaning up after the disease has abated, and prevented the further spread. Where outbreaks have occurred they have held community meet - ings, have formed anti-hog cholera clubs, started clean-up campaigns. Gage county ...0. H. Liebers Seward county ..... ...A. H.

Crop Improvement Work A total of 688 demonstrations were started by county agents for the purpose of improving farm crops. Of these 1S4 were to show Mm value of treating seed oats for the prevention of oat smut. Twenty-two demonstrations were started to show the superiority of home-grown seed corn compared with imported seed corn. The adaptability of certain forage crops to various parts of the state was shown in thirty-two demonstrations with Feterita, fifty with Sudan Grass, and forty-two with Sweet Clover. The value of inoculating alfalfa seed was shown in forty-six demonstrations. Rolling and harrowing winter wheat was shown in twenty-six demonstrations. One hundred thirty demonstrations were undertaken with corn, and ten with pastures. Demonstrations in the seeding of alfalfa was undertaken in thirty-four instances In the work with potatoes, northern seed was compared with home-grown seed, which in Gage county gave an increase of ninety - two bushels to the acre in favor of ths northern grown seed. In Box Butte county it was determined that the seed of potatoes affected with dry rot reduced the yield at the rate of 153.7 bushels marketable potatoes per acre. Potatoes affected with scab and treated gave a yield of thirty bushels per acre more than the same potatoes not treated. Clean potatoes, that is free from scab, gave an increase of seventy-three bushels per acre over scabby seed that was not treated. Orchard Improvement Work Forty-two orchards were used by the county agents in demonstrat - ing the practicability of pruning and spraying in order to insure clean and marketable fruit. A few trees left as checks in these orchards have produced practically no clean marketable fruit this year. </seg>

The Extension News Service has been translated into German, Bo - hemian. Polish, Swedish, Danish, and the tongue of the Indians. During the past year I have edited eleven extension bulletins of the general series, thirty-four pamphlets, and thirty-two miscellaneous out - lines, recipe sheets and circulars, or sixty-seven extension publications, in addition to the ten bulletins of larger size of the agricultural experi - ment station. In connection with the extension work it has been necessary to type 1,556 letters. Up to the beginning of the last quarter, I have done my own office work. Since the beginning of September 159 charts have been made in the office up to January 1, not including posters and small signs. About 125 of the charts were mMe for the Extension Service. </seg>

PUGSLEY. O. A. LIEBERS. Committee NEBRASKA PRODUCTION AND MARKETING Report of Committee of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture It is apparent at the outset that production and marketing should go hand in hand, each receiving its due share of attention, yet for a number of years past the bulk of the students of agricultural economicR gave vent to their ideas by advocating various ways by which produc - tion might be increased. It being taken for granted that the demand would take care of commodity produced. It must be admitted that in a very large number of cases ideas, theories, etc., advanced by men of agricultural thought were of the best and in a very larg ■ measure, the end to be attained was accomplished; Production was increased. The result of this was that production had been developed to an ab - normal degree and out of all proportion to the problem of marketing. Production will be found to follow the lines of least resistance. By this we mean that a very large per cent of the farm produce grown in some localities are done so because conditions are more favorable there than elsewhere, causing the production to be very high at some place while in that particular locality there may be no demand for the commodity at all. The fault of extremely high prices at one place and the correspond - ingly low prices at another point and the instability and fluctuation of the price level lies to a large extent not with supply and demand as much as with the inequality of the system of distribution. Com - modities are demanded in far more places than it is possible to pro - duce them, hence the growth of a very complex system of distribution. The main problem to be concerned with in the system of marketing is to bring the producer and the consumer in such close contact with each other that each may share the greatest possible benefit from the transactions taking place between them. In this discussion the pro - ducer will receive the greatest attention and such suggestions as are offered are in no wise Intended, however, to take advantage of the consumer. * </seg>
            <seg id="p109">109 l-IMM KKMM.- NEBUASKA STATE BOAkU in AGH1LLLTIM The growth of a system of distribution has come about in an effort to meet the demand with a supply, for it is absolutely impossible to change the demand to meet it, consequently produce in excess at one point must be transported to a point where th? demand exceeds the supply. In view of the fact that the production occupies the greater part of the farmer's time the marketing of farm produce is generally left to other persons and as a rule we will find are marketed through some form of commission firm or through one or more middlemen. The main cause for the agitation on the subject of marketing lies in the fact that the farmer in some cases gets only about one-third the price paid by the consumer. Probably some of this is caused by un - scrupulous methods used by middlemen in getting more than a legiti - mate income on the produce they handle. Most of it is caused, how - ever, by the product being forced to pass through too many hands be - fore it reaches the ultimate consumer, each one of these may, how - ever, get only a very small income and yet the producer get only cents for an article for which the consumer pays $1.00. The effort to remedy these conditions has called forth the bast efforts from the present day agricultural economists. So much so that of late we have thought, read, talked and lived in an atmosphere of co-operation. Co-operation on the part of the producer was the panacea which was to bring about a readjustment of things, not to eliminate the middleman, but to curb his power so that the price paid by the consumer would not be so completely eaten up by the profits of the middleman. In this connection various methods might bs cited to bring out some of the commendable features and the drawbacks. The practice of the farmer selling direct to the consumer can and is only practiced in such localities as there exists an active demand for that particular product or products. This form of marketing gener - ally exists in the proximity of cities. If the farmer can get a group of consumers who will take his product regularly, a great saving of time can be brought about; or better still, if he can deliver to a group of associated consumers he will have a condition of direct marketing in its highest state of efficiency. The greatest drawback in the system of direct marketing is that it entails a great amount of time on the part of the producer, which in many cases is not entirely offset by the better price received. From the plan of direct and individual marketing has arisen that of public markets. This form is coming into favor in many parts of the country and has many commendable features and some common draw - backs. The main drawback is that it requires too much time on the part of the farmer in the same way as direct marketing previously al - luded to. Public markets may be owned by the city or by private in- </seg>
            <seg id="p110">110 l'MOTEEUIXUS NEBRASKA STATE I)OAKI) &lt;(V AliKK II.TIKK dividuals, and space is rented at so much per foot. The procedure is very much the same, the farmer brings in his own produce and does his own selling. It follows then that the farmer must be on hand and it is quite possible that, in so doing, he is sacrificing con - siderable Held work which really means more to him. The problem of marketing by parcels post is encouraged more by agricultural magazines than is really justifiable, for reports show ilia! this system has met with very poor results for the most part. Since in this state, the systems suggested can only be used to a moderate degree it is quite apparent that the various marketing asso - ciations hold by far the most in their favor. The thing most con - spicuously in favor of a marketing association which, to a large ex - tent, does not exist in the case of individual marketing is the assump - tion of responsibility by the association. In one section of the state the county agent has found market for and aided ths farmers in making sales of alfalfa seed amounting to several thousand dollars In a great many cases the farmer wanted more for his product from the consumer than he would had he been selling to a dealer. Many farm - ers left samples of seed with the agent requesting him to find a market for it, providing he did not sell it lower than a certain figure; re- peated instances showed that they straightforward sold it to a at a lower figure. An extract from a letter written by a county agricultural agent Illinois to one in Nebraska illustrates the point pretty well. "We ha been having difficulty securing a good grade. The trouble is that t farmers charge us as much or more than the dealer and do not gi us as good a grade I wonder if you could refer us to some loi dealer who could supply us in carload lots at a narrow margin?" Or this one from another letter: "We should prefer only to deal with you direct for many people require a deposit first and then do not realize the obligations they are under." Still another: "The seed Mr sent us was not the .same as his sampl which we still have. As you referred this party to us we beg you to take the matter up with him." These and many others show that many farmers do not appreciat? the gravity of the position in which they are placed, especially if they are marketing at a distance and to un - known parties. In many cases we feel that this is not in any way intentional but is caused by not being informed and he bases his price on his own estimate of its value, regardless of existing market conditions. This is especially true of smaller farm produce which is not produced in great enough amounts to have a definite market at the particular point where produced. Because it is an association, there are many things possible which would not be the case under individual marketing A large amount is </seg>

Also an association of this sort can transact a great deal of business on a very small amount of capital. In any co-operative association and for the purpose of marketing especially, a number of things are absolutely essential for success. The first essential is proper organization and incorporation. The overlooking of the true principles of co-operation has been fatal to a great many associations. Pecuniary benefits must be one of the first principles and it can not be obtained without the feeling of obligation on the part of each one cf the members. The feeling of financial gain must attract to the association so that it Mill be built up right along by the addition of new members. On • of the hardest things that new associations in this state have to overcome, and presumably it is the same everywhere, is the tendency to lose members faster than th?y gain. Again some mem - bers will weaken their own associations by selling elsewhere if they can get a few dollars profit. The associations, here and elsewhere, which have thrived owe almost their entire existence to the fact that they have had a good manager. Poor managers are distressingly fatal in a business of this sort and good ones are about as hard to find as a needle in a straw- Mack. A large number of failures are due also to the fact that the association has been formed for sentimental reasons when, from an economic point of view, it was not necessary to organize one, hence interest waned and the thing was allowed to die. The strongest associa - tions to be found in the country today are those termed by the fruit producers and they are almost countless in number. More because of the nature of the product than anything else, the conditions were such as to force the growers to combine, not enly in marketing, but in vastly niproving and increasing the product. The Farmers' I'nion and kindred organizations are making a strong b : d for favor and the next yaar or two will no doubt witness a great deal of development along this line. Take the main farm products of the state and follow their course from the farm through the various channels to the consumer and note the probable changes and improvements which will take place, as the different systems of marketing develop. Nearly all the grain produced, exclusive of that fed on farms, finds its way to and through the elevators of which three kinds handle the liulk — Independent Elevators owned and operated by private concerns. Lint- Elevators having elevators along railroads at many points but operated from a central office, and Farmers' Elevators. The last one is the form owned and operated by any association of farmers, and it has a decided effect of craating a stronger market for the farmers' grain when it is operated in competition with line or independent ele - vators. </seg>
            <seg id="p112">112 PBOCEEDI.NGS NEBBABKA STATE BOABO OF AGBlCULTLBt The principle in the whole elevator system is that the grain goes from the farmer through the elevator to the large warehouses. The great drawback is that the grain does this too quick, the average farmer not being in position to hold very much of it after harvest. For instance, Duluth, Minn., handles 70 per cent of its total corn re - ceipts in one month, Kansas City handles 33 per cent in January and February; Omaha is fairly constant with 37 per cant in December, January and February. Wheat shows up in the same manner. Chicago receives almost 60 per cent in July and August; Kansas City 43 per cent and Omaha 30 per cent in these two months. From this it would appear that over half the grain crop left the farmers hands in four months. Warehouses in which farmers could store their grain would be a great help. Just how much good co-operative associations could do here remains to be seen with their development, and as the average farmer needs money on his grain it would seem that this would be a good fie d for rural credits. Take the hay crop which is one of the most important crops. Prob - ably in no other crop is the producer so much at sea and uninformed of the actual market demands. We are fortunate in having been in posi - tion to feed the bulk of the hay produced on the farm and yet in some sections a great deal is produced to supply the market. This, for the most part, is shipped to centers such as Omaha, Kansas City, St. Joe, etc. It leaves the farm and is consigned to a commission firm at some of these points. The producer will receive a price according to the grade and on account of the extreme variability, no definite rule obtains at any point. The hay may grade as "choice" — No. 1 — No. 2 — No. 3 — or ' No grade" and the producer has absolutely no conception of what constitutes the various grades. The attempt of the writer to find a market for a large quantity of alfalfa hay revealed the fact that the producer figured his hay would grade from No. 1 to choice, and when actually put on the market actu - ally graded but No. 2 at the best and in many cases No. 3 and "No grade." The fault is that the farmer has no standard of comparison and cannot appreciate that in alfalfa hay, especially a little discolored, a few weeds of foreign grass or cut_a day or two too late will throw it into a lower grade, when a little precaution along this line have meant a dollar or two per ton. The common faults as listed by the centers as Omaha, Kansas City, St. Louis and M'nneapolis. show that a great per cent of the poor hay received at these points was "Cut too late," "Weeds and foreign grasses," and "Sandwiched," mean - ing that poor and mouldy hay had been permitted to become mixed in the process of baling. The first requisite in hay marketing is the produc- </seg>
            <seg id="p113">l'KtHKEUlM.S NEBRASKA STATE 1I0AK1) OF AURIC II.TIKE 113 tion of good uniform quality. In order that justice be done to all con - cerned a definite system of grading should be established and in order to get full value this system must be understood by the producer as well as the dealer. Hay should not, by the farmer, be considered as an auxiliary crop for as long as it is, there will be a great variance as to quality and there is sure to be trouble in marketing it. The marketing of fruit very largely takes place through various as - sociations and to this class we might also add quite a large list of farm products of perishable nature Associations have done a great deal, as before stated, in raising the quality of the product and disposing of it in a manner not possible by single persons. The associations by means of their extensive operations an competent managers can find markets for a product which, by reason of its nature, must ba marketed early or suitably stored in some way. For this reason these associations have very little trouble in holding farmers together. The essential features of a great many such associations is a large warehouse or number of warehouses in which products may be stored until the rush season is over, and the price of the commodity is better. There are also many private warehouses which do not purchase the produce but merely rent cubic space to the produce owner until he is ready to dispose of his produce. The common conception that cold storage, as charged by consum - rs, has a tendency to raise the level of prices is in no way true. A glance at the reports at some of the market centers will show that the prices are on an average about the same, although the extreme fluctua - tions have been eliminated. It is also charged that they keep the produce in storage an abnorm - ally long time. A compilation of the figures has shown that over seventy per cent of the beef put into cold storage is again delivered out in three months; ninety-five per cent of the pork, seventy-five par cent of the poultry, forty per cent of the butter and about fifteen per cent of tha eggs in a like time. It looks then, that the great bulk of the cold storage results in keeping the market from becoming flooded at a short period, when production is the highest. It can easily be seen that this has proved of an immense benefit to the farmer in enabling him to store his products for a time, at a relative small cost and to enable him to dispose of them at a time when the demand is keener. It is hard to understand how this can, when judiciously managed, be of anything but a benefit to both the producer and the consumer. The fact that at flush season thousands of independent merchants gather the surp'us and redistribute it at a time when the supply is scarce, does very little more than to equalize the price and, as before stated, eliminates a great amount of waste at the same time doing away with the extreme fluctuations which most surely, in the long run, are more of a detriment than a benefit. The brief mention which has been </seg>
            <seg id="p114">114 PBOCIEDINGH NKKKASKA STATK HDAKll Ol AUKKULTIKK 1 made of the cold storage products above would hold true in regard tc fruit and other perishable farm products. The various other farm products which might be listed as prov - sions find their way to the consumer through th? middleman to a very large extent and do not need special mention here. The marketing of farm products in the form of live stock is a field largely controlled by the commission men and. as yet. invaded to a very small extent by the farmer himself. It is a field requiring a large amount of executive ability and, as a rule, a large amount of capital is involved as the stock must be handled in carload lots, consequently the small farmer is not in position to do so and is intimidated by th? prospect. It is ap - parent that the honest and experienced commission man is far less apt to make a mistake in this vanture than is the farmer. A few conclusions then: The charge that in cases of larg • pro - duction, the farmer received less than at periods of light production is not true for figures will show that in years of high production prices have remained at a fairly constant level and that farmers have re - ceived a correspondingly strong price for their produce. Production, in crder to assist marketing, must bring forth a higher grade of produce, must seek to produce this as nearly as possible near demand centers. Increase in production olten raises the quality and at the same time cuts down the cost per unit. High quality produce does not go begging on the market at any time. Properly directed energies on the part of the farmer will aid in securing a market. The absence of enterprise in seeking the market accounts tor a great deal more than for its non - existence. Co-operative organizations can and will be the main ! actors in the solution of the marketing problem. Necessity must enter strong y and associations must never be formed just because they have he ■ started somewhere else. A better system of marketing must he thn outgrowth of nc?ssity and, to a very great extent, the producer can aid in solving it. but business ability can never be lost sight of in co - operative associations, and while the middleman will always have his place, it is felt that in the future, systems of marketing will exist on a more common meeting ground than they liav - in the past.

Not only is our lair valuable as an educator, but it is the one place that you can have a real family reunion, meet your friends from all over the county. This alone, will fully repay all the expense incidental to the trip. It is not lair to measure the success or failure of our County Fair by the amount of money taken in at the gates, but rather by drawing a com - parison by the increased excellency of our exhibits and the interest taken by its patrons. The young people of our country are the best asset we hava and the County Pair that is not running along educational lines and doing something to interest the young people of its county are not doing the real purpose of the County Fair and it will be short lived. It is true we must have our horse races and other clean amusements, but no gambling or shows of disrepute should be allowed. We believe that a great many of our County Fairs are spending too much money for races and not enough for premiums. We find by looking over the State Board of Agriculture Report, that the County Fairs of our state are spending more for races than they are for all premiums combined. This should not be. The 1913 report shows that our County Fairs of our state spent (27,839.69 for races, and only $21, - 377.95 for premiums. And another discouraging thing is the amount of premiums offered compared with the amount paid these same fairs offered $52,517.02 in premiums, but only paid $21,377.95. Every agricul - tural society should make their premium list, then endeavor to have every class full and the premiums ready to pay the last day of the Fair. A well-balanced and successful County Fair is ons that pays at least as much for premiums as they do for races, one-half as much for free attractions as they do for races or premiums, have the organi - zation made up of men that are fair men 365 days in the year and men that will work together on business methods. Give your patrons just a little more than you advertise. It should not be how much can wa get for what we give, but how much can we give for what we are getting. Not how much money can we make, but how much good can we do. Make the Fair educational as well as a place of amusement.

DICKMAN George K Dickman was born in Cambridge, Massa - chusetts, November 10, 1854, where he received a public school education. His young manhood was spent in com - mercial life in Boston. On the 19th day of March, A. D. 1879, he was united in marriage to Miss Florence B. Kemp. On January 2, 1883, they came to Nebraska and settled at Seward where the well known firm of "The Babson-Dick - man Implement Company" was formed and he has been connected with this organization continuously since. Mr. Dickman acted in the capacity of speed clerk at the State Kair held in 1884. He was appointed a member of the Nebraska State Hoard of Agriculture to fill the unexpired term of Edmund Mclntyre on Dec. 26, 1905, and elected as a member in January. 1906 and served continuously until the time of his death. He acted as one of the Board of Managers in 1909 and was elected Treasurer of the Board in 1910, which position he filled until the date of his death March 6th, 1916. RESOLUTION WHEKEAS: Almighty God, in his wisdom, has drafted our honored member. George P. Dickman, for service in the Great Beyond, and WHEREAS: His consistent effort in the Held of labor assigned to him by the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture has been of such value and character as to make such service impossible to measure by earthly compensation, and WHEREAS: In contemplating his virtues, from our narrow, selfish viewpoint, we fain would have had his life spared for future earthly -i-rvic-f both to his beloved wife and his fellowmen, therefore be it RESOLVED: That we, the members of the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture, in this dark hour of affliction extend to his bereaved wife our sincere, heartfelt sympathy in this measureless loss and that this resolution be spread upon our minutes and a copy thereof be forwarded to Mrs. Dickman W.

            <seg id="p317">317 I'KOt EEm.V,* NEBRASKA STATt BUABD OF AGRICULTURE •AGRICULTURAL GEOGRAPHY OF DAWE8 COUNTY, NEBRA8KA By Frank A. Hayes, University of Nebraska. Dawes county comprises an area of 1402 square miles, or 897,280 acres in northwestern Nebraska. The surface is uneven, and divided into three belts or regions which extend across the county in an east - west direction Named in order from north to south the belts are: White River Basin, Pine Ridge and the Table Land. (Figure 1.) White River Basin is a broad, shallow area which drains northeast - ward through White River into South Dakota. Pine Ridge is an irregu - lar region of rough broken land, narrow valleys and park land. It is the scenic feature of the county because of its high rugged topography and mantle of pines. A strip of comparatively smooth land within this region is known as park land. This, when viewed from the edge of the table on the south, resembles a great grass covered trough modified by numerous deep, steep-walled canyons from which pine trees project above the general level. The high land south of Pine Ridge is nearly level, where unsroded. but becomes rolling to hilly bordering the Niobrara drainage. The nearly flat land just south of Pine Ridge and extending half way across the county from the eastern boundary is locally known as the "Big Table." Until 1914 the state survey regarded this as a part of Bo\ Hutte Table. We now know that the two areas are distinctly separated and that a new name should be given that portion which is in Dawes county. I hereby propose the name "Dawes Table." Altitude.

The entire drainage except a few sections in the northwest corner is affected through the Niobrara and White rivers and their tributaries. White River flows in a north - easterly direction in a valley course of 42 miles across the northwestern part of the county. This river and its tributaries drain White River Basin and Pine Ridge Region. The river channel is between 15 and 25 feet wide, is very swift and causes considerable damage by erosion and flooding during seasons of abundant precipitation. Water power has been developed at Crawford. Following is a list of the northern and southern tributaries of White River: Northern Tributaries Southern Tributaries White Clay Creek Little Cottonwood Creek Cottonwood Creek English Creek Squaw Creek Hooker Creek Indian Creek West Ash Creek Ash Creek Lone Tree Creek Messenger Creek Willow Creek Bohemian Creek Rush Creek Maiden Creek North Creek Alkali Creek Trunk Butte Creek Dead Horse Creek Chadron Creek Bordeaux Creek Beaver Creek Few of the above streams run water during the entire year. All the northern tributaries go dry during seasons of prolonged drought. Of the southern tributaries. West Ash, Ash, Indian, Trunk Butte. Dead Horse, Chadron, Bordeaux and Beaver are permanent. The Niobrara drains that part of the county which lies south of Pine Ridge. This stream flows in an easterly direction for a distance of approximately 27 miles close to the southern border of the county. The main channel varies in width from 25 to 40 feet, being somewhat wider than that of the White River. It has a more sluggish flow, however and does not afford as many power sites The principal tributaries of the Niobrara are Cottonwood, Pebble and Pepper creeks, all of which drain from the north. These streams are intermittent during most seasons. Supplementary to the rivers, creeks and branches are numerous small drainage ways which run no water except immediately after a rainfall. These draws give complete and adequate drainage to almost every farm in the county. . Climate. Climatologkal data for Dawes county are compiled in the table below. They were secured from the record of the Weather Bureau station located at Fort Robinson in the east central portion. The figures obtained represent the local climatic conditions.

It is lightest during the winter with a mean for December, January and February of 1.91 inches. The greater part of the precipitation in ths summer occurs as local storms, the rain olten falling on small areas. The rainfall during May and June is well d.stributed, periods of drought being almost unknown. In July the distribution is less favorable, further decreasing in August and September causing crop failures in some years. Total crop failures, however, seldom occur over the entire county, owing to the differences in soils, early maturing crops, and improved methods ol cultivation. According to records, the average snowfall during the last three years, 1913, 1914 and 1915 inclusive, was almost 24 inches. This occurred mainly during December. January. February and March. The winds are prevailing from the northwest, south and southeast. Tornadoes ar ■ rare. The records show an annual average of between 210 and 220 clear and 145 and 155 cloudy or partly cloudy days, for the years l»o&lt;t in 1914 inclusive. The foregoing is a general description of the climatic and weather conditions in the county. It does not account for the conditions in ex teptional places, such as parks, canyons and the wc41-defined exposures facing different directions. The State Conservation and Soil Survey has studied the climate of these areas with considerable detail. The data derived therefrom should be of use in specialized agriculture. Structure. The structure of the county is comparatively simple Below the mantle rock and exposed in many places are well deh'ii *d sedimentary formations. These lie in a nearly horizontal position except that there are deformations in the northeastern part of the county from which the beds dip gradually and quite rapidly to the westward. In point of age, the geologic formations belong to the Cretaceous Tertiary and Quartenary series. The oldest formations exposed lie near the top of the Cretaceous system. They are represented by the Niobrara and Pierre. The Niobrara chalk rock is brought to th? sur - face in the northeastern part of the county. It has a thickness exposed of about 50 feet and consists mainly of massive dark gray chalk or soft limestone which weathers to a buff or cream color. This is overlain by the Pierre Shale which outcrops very generally over the northwestern and northern parts of the county. The formation extends southward under later beds and underlies all other parts of the area, The thickness of the Pierre formation is not definitely known but it probably exceeds 1000 feet where not exposed to erosion. It consists principally of clay which is loosely indurated making, at places, shale rock. Next above the Pierre Shal;&gt; and lying unconformablr on it is the base of the Tertiary series. This series is composed of the Chadron Hrule. Gering and Arikaree formations. The Chadron and Brule divisions are usually classed under the name- White River beds. The Gering and Arikaree constitute the well known Loup Fork beds. Generally </seg>

The Brule clay, according to Darton. is about 600 feet thick. It is exposed gen - erally across the county between White River and Pins Ridge. The formation is a mass of sediment, consisting mainly of silt and clay, or a mixture of fine silt, clay and sand, of pale flesh color, containing numerous fossil beds. The Gering formation is a loosely bound sand deposit which varies from coarse to fin 3 and is often sufficiently cemented to be classed as soft sandstone. At its base there is usually more or less conglomerate of local origin. The thickness varies from a thin wedge to over 200 feet. It is well exposed on the north facs of Pine Ridge where it forms the cliffs or vertical walls. The Arikaree formation has a great deal of calcareous cement which binds quite firmly the sand, of which it is largely composed. This for - mation outcrops in Pine Ride;-' and Niobrara valley. It extends through the table lands between these two areas of outcrops. The formation lias two well-defined hard layers which become cliff formers, one of these the upper division is near the surface of the smooth table land, and the other occurs below the floor of Pine Ridge park. The recent deposits of the Quartenary Period are alluvial terraces, flood plains, and small developments of dune sand. Topography and Soil. As 'previously outlined the topography is divided into the Dawes Table and its eroded phase. Pine Ridge, and White River Basin. Dawes Table is a very flat plain dissected at in - tervals by deep, narrow, steep walled canyons draining southward and eastward to the Niobrara. These canyons gradually widen as they near the river, thus causing the table to lose its flat characteristic and become a region of gently rolling to rolling topography, cut by an intricate system of wide, shallow drainage ways. The soil of the Dawes Table is very uniform. It is of residual origin, having been derived through the process of disintegration and decomposition of the underlying Arikaree formation. It consists of a brown to dark brown friable silt loam. 15 inches deap, underlain by a yellowish brown to light grayish brown compact silty clay loam, pas - sing at 24 inches into a stiff compact silty clay. In the deeper canyons where the weathered material is shallower, the silt loam gives way to a very fine sandy loam, differing little in texture with depth. The native grasses of the high table consist chiefly of western wheat grass, (Agropy - ron spicatum) grama grass. (Bouteloua oligostachya) and buffalo grass (Bulbilis dactyloides). Owing to the comparatively open structure and desirable texture of th? soils of the Dawes Table, they are very tractable and can be cultivated under a wide range of moisture conditions. The subsoil is a good reservoir for water and maintains a sufficient amount for growing crops except under the most extreme conditions of drought. </seg>

(Figure 2.) The acreage sown to this crop, however, does not far exceed that of wheat. The eroded portion or the Dawes Table, owing to its different topo - graphic position has been subjected to an increased amount of leaching and the soils are mostly sandy. They consist of a dark brown, brown or gray brown sandy surface soil underlain by a lighter colored, very (Figure 2) — "Rye on the Dawes Table friable to floury silt loam, fine sandy loam or very tine sandy loam. Tfca soils are used chiefly lor grazing, though they are also adapted to agriculture over a large percentage of their area. The native grasses consist chiefly of sand grass, (Triplasis purpurea) needle grass, (Stipa comata) grama and buffalo grass. I'pon the more exposed ridges of this area the yucca (Yucca glauca) is found. Practically the same crops can be grown here as on the fiat phase of the table. The soil, how - ever, does not retain its moisture as well, and consequently there is greater danger of crop failure during seasons of prolonged drought. In the western half of the county the eroded table land joins Pine Ridge on the north. Here the conifers follow the drainage ways across the table land area. Local deposits of dune sand are found north of the Niobrara River. The Niobrara flood plain, here mapped with the table land area, is seldom over one-half mile wide. It is bounded by gentle slopes inter - rupted by occasional low cliffs. The valley bottom is 400 or 500 feet below the crest of Pine Ridge.

The slopes are too steep and the soils too shallow to permit extensive cultivation. The soil is much the same as that of the eroded table land. It is generally shal'ower and more sandy, however, and contains a much (Figure 3) — General View Across Pine Ridge Park </seg>

The chief resource of this rough land is timber, which will be taken up later under Timber Resources. The Pine Ridge Park (Figure 3) is characterized by a gently rolling topography cut by deep narrow canyons. The divides are generally devoid of tknber though ths canyons contain fairly dense growths of pines. These trees form an arborescent network over the entire region. The treeless areas are never large and seldom exceed 160 acres, they are so numerous, however, as to make this region more suitable (or agri - culture than for timber production. The surface soil is a brown to dark brown, very fine sandy loam, generally containing a larg .&gt; amount of organic matter. It is underlain by lighter colored material of the same texture which differs little with depth. The grasses of this region are the sams as those found in Pine Ridge proper. Corn, wheat, oats, barlty. rye and potatoes are the principal crops. Droughts are not so common here as in many other portions of the county. The timber surrounding the parks acts as windbreaks and thus prevents evaporation. The soil on the canyon floors occurs in very narrow strips. It is a deep, dark, fertile, fine, sandy loam. Its distribution is not favorable for agriculture on a large scale. The soil grows timber and where cleared produces a variety of farm crops and fruits. The White River basin has three natural divisions controlled by geological formations. They are tha Brule Clay Area, the Pierre Clay Area and the alluvial bottom lands. At places where erosion is severe, in the Brule Clay Area, bail lands are' often seen. These ars devoid of vegetation and it is impos sible to utilize them for agriculture. They are relatively small in extent, however, and the land in which they occur is utilized for pasture. Where erosion is not gullying the surface of the soil and the vegetative cover - ing prevails the land is gently rolling to undulating. The soil found here is composed of a brown to dark brown silt, or vary fine sandy loam underlain in most cases by a light yellowish gray to gray, floury silt loam. Over small areas the subsoil is a light brown, heavy silty clay loam resembling a hardpan in texture and location. The soBs are very productive during seasons of abundant rainfall. They do not, how - ever, withstand drought as well as those of the High Table. This is due to their more open sandy texture and lower water-holding capacity. Alfalfa, corn, oats, wheat, barley and potatoes are the principal cul - tivated crops of the Brule Clay Area. (Figure 4.) The principal for - age grassas are western wheat grass, buffalo grass, bluest em. (Andro - pogon Hallii) sandgrass and grama. The Pierre Clay Area is composed of gently rolling to rugged topo - graphy. The soil is very uniform and is locally termed '"Dark Gumbo." It consists of a brown, or olivs brown heavy c'ay which is very sticky when wet, underlain by a dark drab iieavy clay, which below 30 inches becomes mottled with gray or brown. This soil is chiefly used for graz - ing and hay production. The principal grasses are the western wheat </seg>

This is probably due to its greater drouth resisting qualities and to the heavy compact nature of the soil and subsoil of the Pierre Clay. Agri - culture is practiced on a very small scale. The difficulty of working the heavy soil and the poor yields received in return have held this industry in check. Plenty of moisture, however, would almost insure against crop failure, as the soil becomes more friable with proper cultivation, moisture and aerial conditions. Lying within and overlying a portion of the Pierre Clay Area is the Chadron formation. This formation usually occurs as isolated hum - mocks or low rounded hills. It forms a rough broken badly eroded topo - graphy characterized by scant vegetation and poor water supply. The soil is a heavy clay loam much resembling the Pierre Clay proper though lighter in color and of a less plastic nature. It is used as pasture and hay land. Western wheat grass is the predominate species. The alluvial land of the White River Basin lies chiefly between the Brule and Pierre Clay areas, the largest distribution being along White River. It occurs also along Chadron, Bordeaux, Dead Horse, Ash and other creeks. The alluvial land consists of flood plains and terraces. The terrace surfaces are' 20 to 30 feet above the flood plain. They are quite well defined and consist of a dark brown to brown silt or very fine sandy loam underlain by a lighter colored subsoil of much the same texture. This is probably the most valuable soil in the county, due to its fertility and nearness to irrigation water. The leading crops are alfalfa, corn, wheat, rye, oats and native hay.

It is brown to light yellowish brown becoming lighter in color with depth. Alfalfa and wild hay are the chief crops though corn, potatoes, wheat, barley and rye thrive where irrigation is practised. In the northeast corner of the county (Figure 1) is a small area in which the Pierre clay has been almost entirely eroded and the Niobrara chalk rock is exposed in many places. This area has a rough, deeply eroded topography, unsuited for agriculture, but supports a fairly dense growth of pine and juniper. Water Supply. Dawes county is in a region of low rainfall. The general development and the distribution of population are governed to a large extent by the ground and surface water resources. There is not sufficient rainfall to insure against occasional crop failures. The under - ground waters present a variety of features. In many localities there are large supplies at moderate depths and in other places the amount of water within reach of the average farmer is so small as to seriously interfere with the settlement and development. The greatest difficulty in obtaining water has been in the area occupied by the Brule Clay and Pierre formations. In Niobrara valley supplies of water are obtain. -d from shallow wells in the narrow strip of alluvial lands along the river. On the table lands plenty of water is found at depths of 50 to 150 feet on the eroded slopes and 150 to 300 feet on the higher parts of the Dawes Table. There are many springs in the Pine Ridge belt. They supply the water of the permanent streams which finally join White Riv m (Figure 5.) The water of these clear swift streams is used for ranch.

The creeks afford trout fishing and could be used in the development of many small water powers. Good well water supplies are obtained in Pine Ridge park at a depth of 100 to 200 feet. in the Pierre Clay area north of White River, agricultural devel - opment is seriously hindered by the lack of sufficient water for farm purposes. The streams are small and do not flow during the drier times of the year. A supply is obtained, however, by damming the longer drainage ways and thus holding the flood water for use during the dry months. This method of obtaining water is practiced in a very small way and chiefly for stock and household purposes. There are practically no springs and very few wells in the Pierre day area. The well water is generally of poor quayty because of its mineralization. The surface water, however, is not harmful to either man or stock. Irrigation. Dawes county has considerable acreage under cultivation with the assistance of irrigation. There are several ditches along the White and Niobrara rivers and some of the smaller valleys. The water rights are controlled by individual farmers, consequently the ditches are short and water only a small acreage. Alfalfa is the chief irrigated irop. The waters of the Niobrara river are utilized extensively for the irrigation of narrow strips of bottom land. There are canals at frequent intervals along the course, which furnish water for many hay meadows. Some grain crops are also raised, but their acreage Is small. The minor streams which are used for irrigation purposes are Bordeaux, Chadron, Dead Horse and Ash Creeks. These furnish a relatively small amount of water and the acreage irrigated by them is very limited. Settlement. Prior to 1884 northwestern Nebraska was occupied chiefly by Indians and open rangers. At that time Dawes county was included in Sioux and Box Butte counties. During that year, however, it was organized from a part of Sioux county and in 1886 a portion of Box Butte county was annexed. In 1884 the Elkhorn, Missouri and Valley railroad extended no farther than Valentine. In the fall of 1884 there were but a few settlers in the county and these were located at Chadron, then on White River, a short distance south of where Dakota Junction now stands. In the summer of 1885 the railroad was built from Valentine to White River Basin. Upon its completion there was a great influx of people who settled the county, beginning near White River. By the end of that year much of the county had been homesteaded. The town of Chadron was moved from its former location and placed where it now stands in August, 1885. The estimated population of the town was 1500. In August, 1886, one year from the plotting of the townsite. the town was organized. The Pierre Clay Area was the last to become settled by the home - seeker. Not much permanent settlement was made here until after the Kincaid Art came into effect. This was due to the unproductivity of the soil and the inadequate water supply. </seg>

According to the census, the population in 1890 was 9.722 and in 1900 it was 6,288, a decrease of 36.1',; . The land held by mortgages and loan companies previous to this emigration period tell into the hands of the remaining settlers who saw opportunities for free grazing by borrowing money to buy stock. Later these stockmen, fearing trouble in grazing land which did not belong to them, bought the tax titles and rights of loan companies. Grazing operations continued until about 1901 when farming was again started in order to produce teed for the cattle, horses and other ani - mals with which the county was becoming overstocked. Population. According to the 19H* census the population of Dawes county is 8,254, an increase of 32.8', over the 1900 census. Of this number there are only 168 of the colored races, 105 of these are negroes and the remaining 63 Chinese. Japanese and Indians. The county has a rural population of 4 persons per square mile. This is not very evenly distributed over the entire region, topography, soils and water, being the governing factors. The Brule clay area, with its rolling topography and numerous streams, probably now ranks first in density of rural population. The Dawes table, with its Hat surface, rich soil and abun - dant supply of ground watar. ranks second. Pine Ridge is a very sparsely populated area owing t population is in the park land rough topography. Most of thf The Pierre Clay area, with is water supply, is the most sparsely heavy intractable soil, and scant populated part of the county. Of the urban population { 191 nsusi Chadron. a city of 2,687 located in the northaastern part of the county, is the center. The city, the county seat of Dawes county, is the local shipping point for the surrounding country. Crawford, a town of 1,323 inhabitants, is located in the central portion close to the western border. Both places depend largely on the produca of the surrounding country. There are four small villages in the county, which have been included in the rural population, viz: Wayside, Whitney. Belmont and Marsland. These towns are all located along railroads and are important as local ship - ping points. Development. As previously staled the agricultural development of Dawes county did not begin in earnest until about 1901. Prior to this time there had been a large influx of settlers but dry years, accom - panied by severe crop failures, had driven them out. Following this emigration, the county fell into the hands of cattlemen who made stock - raising the chief industry. The county was covered with a good growth of grass of various kinds. This grass land was utilized almost exclu - sively as range for horses and cattle. In 1901. however, it became necessary to start farming operations. </seg>
            <seg id="p329">ntOCEEVIK'GS .\CBKASKA .STATE BOAWJ OK AGKK'ULTUBK .fcftt The progress in agriculture during the first few years was slow as most of the farmers were working in a new region and under dif - ferent climatic and soil conditions than those with which they were accustomed. Within the last five years, however, agriculture has ad - vanced very rapidly and there are comparatively few areas which are not utilized to the best advantage, under the existing conditions of topog - raphy, water supply and soils. Dry farming is practiced on the greater part of the cultivated land and from the very beginning a large percentage of the total acreage has been utilized for growing wheat. Spring wheat is usually grown. Velvet Chaff and Eastern Fife are the principal varieties Winter wheat is coming into more general use, Turkey Red being grown most exten - bively. During the last few years, the acreage sown to rye and spelts has greatly increased as these crops seem to withstand drought better lhan wheat. Whera irrigation is practiced in valleys, good yields of all crops are much more certain than on the un-irrigated sections The growing of fruits is practiced to a very limited extent in some parts of the county.

Yields of 25 to 30 bushels per acre are reported in very favorable seasons. When droughts occur in the spring and summer months the average yield is very low and in many cases the crop is a failure. The rye grown in the county is used chiefly for feeding. When thrashed the yield ranges from 8 to 10 bushels per acre. Oats is grown quite extensively. This crop ranks next to wheat in acreage. It yields from 15 to 20 bushels per acre during a season of average rainfall. The production of corn is becoming more general (Figure 6.) It requires a careful conservation of moisture and yields are very uncertain in dry years. The varieties grown are Early Dent and Squaw Corn, both of which mature early and generally avoid fall frosts. In favorable years the yield ranges between 15 and 20 bushel* per acre. Barley is grown to a very limited extent. This crop yields between 12 and 15 bushels per acre. Potatoes are produced quite ex tensively, both for home use and for distant markets. The Ohio ami Red Triumph are the principal varieties. The tubers are firm and of excellent quality. The yield over most of the county ranges from 50 to 60 bushels per acre. There are places, however, in the high open parks of Pine Ridge where 200 and 250 bushels per acre have been harvested. The absence of the potato beetle greatly reduces the cost of labor in tending this crop. Alfalfa is gaining in acreage and import - ance in many parts of the county. It produces best, however, in the lower levels and especially in the irrigated region along White River. Over the entire area on which alfalfa is grown, an average of two cuttings with a yield of one and one-half tons per acre is obtained. In the irrigated sec - tions where seed is not desired, a total yield of three to four tons can be expected. The production of alfalfa seed is coming to be an important industry. The first crop is cut about the latter part of June. The second crop Is allowed to mature and is finally harvested between the first and fifteenth of September. The dry weather occurring during the latter part of August greatly aids in seed production as the younger growth is held in check and tbe entire nourishment is used in filling the pods. Stock raising is still a very important industry. Wild grass grows extensively throughout the county. Many localities, owing to topographic and soil conditions are not suitable for any other crop. Most land not in cultivation is either being used for pasturage or native hay production The species of grass and their yields per acre are largely determined by the water supply and the soils of the area in which they are found. During years of moderate rainfall the hay produced on Dawes Table and its eroded slopes will average one-third ton per acre. On the irrigated portions of the Niobrara flood plain the yield is greater, reaching above one-half ton per acre. In the White River valley, the average yield is one-fourth to one third ton per acre. North of White River in the Pierre Clay area, tin - western wheat grass is by far the most important for hay. This is used </seg>

It is claimed by most farmers to be more valuable ton for ton than alfalfa for feeding purposes. The yield is rather low except on areas under irrigation. Four or five acres are required to produce a ton of hay over most of this area. The agricultural development of the county is of such recent date that no system of crop rotation is in use and the greater portion of the cultivated land has been utilized for the growing of small grains. Th. - larger percentage of the wheat is planted in the spring, about 76 pounds to the acre. Generally very little preparation is given to the seed bed. The wheat is sown broadcast in the old stubble field and double disked in. The method usually requires more seed and does not insure as uniform a stand as would the method of sowing with a press drill. Rye. oats and barley are planted in much the same manner as wheat. In harvesting the small grains, binders are used almost exclusively. It is desirable to remove the straw from the ground as there is not sufficient moisture to insure its thorough rotting before the succeeding crop is sown. Little or no fertilizer or manure is used on any of the soils in the county. This is due to the newness of the country and the cheapness of the land. Live stock has relatively great importance in the agricultural develop - tent of the county. According to the 1910 census, the value of animals sold and slaughtered was $592,578, almost as much as the entire value of all grain, fruit and vegetable products. Cattle and horses are the chief sources of revenue. The wide expanses of hay and pasture lands afford abundant forage for these animals. Nearly all the cattle of the region are sold as range stock to eastern feeders, who fatten them for the market. The dairy industry is as yet in its infancy. The silo, however, is asi coming into use. This means of saving the corn crop for feed during dry years is almost certain to increase the number of dairy farms. Grade Holstein and dual purpose Shorthorns compose most of the dairy herds. The raising of horses has been practised since the first settlement, starting with small animals, used chiefly in the cattle business. Selec - tion for breeding purposes, however, has gradually improved the stock until at present it compares very favorably with that of the eastern counties. Sheep raising is a very small industry in this region. The raising of hogs is coming more into practice each year. Nearly every farm has a small herd. This occupation, however, will probably never reach great importance because the acreage of com and alfalfa land is limited. The absence of cholera, however, greatly cheapens the cost of hog raising and on such land as is adapted to alfalfa and corn the grow - ing of hogs should be a very profitable industry. Moat farmers have found that larger returns are realized from diversified farming, it being more profitable to market the farm produce in the form of live stock. </seg>

The farms are operated almost exclusively by their owners and there is a relatively small percentage of the population without an occupation. The area of most farms is large, sometimes including several sec- lions. It has been difficult to determine land values. A very small per - centage of the land has changed hands for cash. The present owners are either the original settlers or have acquired title through trade. The values here given are estimates of reliable ranchmen and real estate dealers. The land of the Dawes Table is estimated to be worth $25 to $35 per acre, depending on the improvements, while the eroded table land is worth from $7 to $15 per acre, depending on its location. The irrigated bottom land along the Niobrara River and White River is probably worth from $40 to $60 per acre, in some cases running much higher. The rough broken land of Pine Ridge is valued at about $10 and that of the park land $25 per acre. The land on the north slopes of the White River basin will range from $15 to $25 per acre, depend ing upon the location with respect to market, topography and water supply. The land in the Pierre (lay Area is worth from $3 to $15 per acre. In areas where the topography is level and it would be possible by means of a dam to hold the flood waters for irrigation, the value of this land will reach the higher figure. Over most of the area, how - ever, such conditions do not exist. Timber Resources. The occurrence of timber in this region is re stricted to certain localities, though the total area is by no means small Of the 1402 square miles comprise are covered with a dense to mediun by tree growth occurs under three 1 in the county, approximately 200 stand of timber. The area covered conditions of distribution. Along Pine Ridge there is a n: iderately wide zone of scattered dense pine timber. (Figure 7.)

The canyon and valley Moors leading from Pine Kidge across the northern slopes of the White River basin are characterized by a fairly dense growth of broad-leaved species. The bottom land alone White River is well timbered throughout the county. In the northeastern portion of Dawes county the rough, broken, gul - lied topography of the Niobrara chalk rock and the base of the Pierre formation support a fairly dense mixed stand of pine and juniper. The great lumber tree of the west, western yellow pine. (Pinus ponderosa) is the predominating species of the Pine Ridge area. The tree as found here, however, does not compare very favorably with those found in the western states. They are of medium size and rarely attain a height of over 60 feet. The trunks are stocky with a short, clear length and rarely exceed a breast-high diameter of two feet. Very fre - quently in the open the branches extend almost to the ground with no </seg>

These plots were chosen very carefully and represented a typical stand for the locality in which they were taken. The number of trees of certain heights and diameters as given in this table is probably high for some localities and low for others, but may be taken as a fair average lor the entire Pine Ridge Region of Dawes county. The same will hold true for the number of saedlings, saplings and dead trees found on each acre of ground producing a stand of timber. </seg>

The phenomenon in this region is probably due, in part at least, to the scarcity of squirrels, chipmunks and other seed destroying rodents so common farther west. As observed on the eroded table lands the pines are s'.owly invad - ing the grass areas. From the higher elevations narrow, tortuous and irregular strips of timber are seen extending in a southeasterly direc - tion across the region. This invasion is made possible by the exposure of newer and newer rock areas by erosion forces that slowly remove the grassy sod from the uplands. Small isolated stands of quaking aspen (l'opulus tremuloides) are occasionally found in the deeper canyons of Pine Kidge, especially along the branches leading into the head of Ash Creek. Thsse trees form a striking contrast to the coniferous species surrounding them. They range from 15 to 30 feet in height and from 2 to 6 inches in diameter. The bark is an ashy gray color and very smooth. The leaves are small and rounded and seem to rustle continually even though the breeze be hardly noticeable. The topography and soils of the northeast portion of the area while apparently differing widely from Pine Ridge region support a fairly dense growth of pine and juniper. Through the process of erosion the clays so detrimental to most coniferous growth have been practically removed from the Brule, Pierre and Chadron formations. The heavier rocks, pebbles and mineral matter so abundant in these formations have remained intact and are now found lying thickly on or close to the surface of the ground. The above mentioned process of soil weathering has left the north - east corner of the county in good condition for coniferous growth. The rough stony topography together with the abundance of lime derived from the underlying chalk rock forms an ideal soil for red cedar (Jun - iperus virginiana). The small amount of clay, however, not completely removed is detrimental to the western yellow pine which requires an open sandy, well ventilated soil. This tree does not thrive as well here as on the Arikaree formation of Pine Ridge. It is nearly all of scrub growth with gnarled, twisted trunks and branches and of little economic importance. The juniper is a short, gnarled, stocky tree seldom attain - ing a height of over 20 feet, though it often has a butt diameter rang - ing from 10 to 14 inches. The trunk has practically no clear length at all and the lower branches sometimes lie on the surface of the ground. This forest area is surrounded on all sides by a practically treeless plain composed of either the Pierre or Brule formations. Ths tree species found growing here have evidently been transported from Pine Ridge. The seed of the western yellow pine has probably been brought in by the waters of White River or Beaver Creek, both of which flow from or through Pine Ridgr. The juniper seed has. in all probability, 1&gt;h»&gt;m </seg>

The timber has bean a valuable asset since the first settlers entered the county. The western yellow pine has furnished logs from which all farm structures were built. Fuel hag been obtained both from this tree and from the broad-leaved species. Fence posts are cut from nearly all species. The juniper found in the northeast portion of the county fur - nishes the best post material in the region. This tree has been very little used, however, on account of the difficulty encountered in securing It. The topography is so rough and the trees suitable for post material so scattered that it is questionable whether ft would pay the farmer to i ut and haul them. As early as 1885 and before the railroad extended into the county, a saw mill was set in operation at the head of Ash Creek. During 1885 and 1886 five hundred thousand board feet of western yellow pine were cut and sold. The mill consisted of a 60 H. P. engine, a 44 inch circular saw and a 16 foot carriage. It was equipped with a planer, a shingle mill and a lath mill. The output was between 10 and 12 thousand board feet per day. At that time the timber was mostly owned by the govern - ment and could not be cut unless bought. There was no competition and a very high pries was set on all mill products. Shingles sold for $7.00, lath for $5.00, and rough surface lumber for $50.00 per M. The output was hauled long distances as this mill supplied the only lumber in the county at that time. At the present time there are thre? small mills in operation, the largest of which is located on Ash Creek in the same locality as the first mill in the county. When running at lull capacity the present mill has an output of 4,000 board feet per day. It is equipped with a 16 H. P. engine, a 44 inch circular saw and a 16 foot carriage. Three men are required to operate it, an engineer and two sawyers. The cost of oper - ation is about $6.00 per day. The lumber sells at the mill for $11.00 to $18.00 per M., depending on quality. The kind of material produced depends entirely upon the local demand. During the present year, 1915. the major portion of the output has been dimension and bridge materials. Slabs, the by-product in log squaring, sell for five cents apiece and are used by ths farmers chiefly in fence and corral construction. It has been estimated that about 30',', of the logs hauled to the mill have heart rot. This condition could be greatly improved by care - nil management. In fact the entire region is one in which there is a great opportunity for the working out of practical forest principles. A careful study of forest conditions would result in making the forests of Pine Ridge a much more useful and valuable asset to Dawes county. Transportation and Communication Facilities. The transportation facilities are governed by the Chicago &amp; Northwestern and the Chicago. Burlington &amp; Quincy railroads together with the numerous highways </seg>

The Chicago &amp; Northwestern crosses the northeastern portion of the area. This road carries most of the produce for that half of the county. Bordeaux. Chadron, Dakota Junction and Wayside are the only stations inside the county on the main line of this road. A branch of the Northwestern extends from Dakota Junction southwestward through Whitney to Craw - ford and beyond to Lander, Wyoming. The Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy railroad crosses the southwestern portion of the county, run - ning through Marsland, Belmont, Crawford and Horn Siding. The wagon roads are in good condition throughout the greater part of the area. Owing to the newness of the country and the rugged char - acter of much of its topography a relatively small percentage of the road* follow section lines. Those which have been laid out as permanent high - ways are usually kept in fair condition. Very little attention, however, is given to the less important ones. The roads in the southern and southeastern parts are more easily maintained than are those of the region around Chadron and north of White River. This is due to the more sandy nature of the soil in the southern part of the area. The gumbo roads north of the river become almost impassable for a few days after each heavy rain, excessive precipitation, however, does not often occur, hence they are in good condition during most of the year. Much of the county is reached by rural free delivery routes. Telephones are in general use. Schools are located at convenient places over the entire county. There are three city high schools, one state normal and sev - enty-four rural schools. Markets. The greater portion of the produce of Dawes county is handled in the local markets. Most of the grain produced is used for home consumption. Timber and lumber find a local demand. The chief resources for which the local demand is not adequate are wheat, rye, potatoes, hay, alfalfa seed and live stock. These commodities find markets outside the area. The surplus hay is shipped to Fort Robin - son, to the fort located at Sturgess, S. D.. and to the Omaha market. Wheat and rye are shipped to Omaha. Potatoes find a ready market in Omaha and Lincoln, buyers being sent from these points to purchase the crop as fast as it is harvested. The surplus alfalfa saed, for the production of which the county is well adapted, is shipped to all parts of the United States. Cattle, sheep, hogs and horses go to Omaha. </seg>

Condra, University of Nebraska, Chairman of the Advisory State Highway Commission. The writer proposes in this connection to briefly outline some of the things which should receive careful consideration in highway improve - ment. The subject is discussed from an unbiased point of view and from the angle of service to the greatest number. Nebraska is making rapid progress in road improvement. The state ranks high in the condition of her dirt roads. These roads reach more generally throughout the country than is the case in most states. As a rule, they are dragged and in good condition except when modified by rain, snow drifts and melting snows. The statement often made that our roads are the poorest, is therefore in error. It is true, however, that Nebraska has low rank in the mileage of roads built of gravel, concrete, stone and brick. We should clearly dis - tinguish between the two conditions, i. e. the good dirt road and the so-called permanent road. The following is a summary of problems which have importance in planning highway improvements. Road* Must Suit Physical Conditions and Traffic Needs Few people realize how diverse this state really is in its climate, soils, topography, road materials, industrial development and density of population. These factors usually are overlooked in discussions made at good roads meetings. Hence there is no general agreement concerning such as dragging, width of road, culverts, markers, administration. The discussions continue, nearly everyone speaking his own experience and for a locality. Perhaps all are right or nearly so. The fact is that some few roads must remain practically as trails. Some should not be graded and dragged because the native sod must be retained where possible to prevent wind erosion and to maintain the position of a trail or road. Over much of the state nature greatly favors good road building by grading and dragging. We might enumerate a long list of conditions, favorable and unfavorable, the distribution of which does not extend throughout the whole of Nebraska, but such does not seem necessary. The problem involved here is one of general education, of broaden - ing our experience and knowledge. It is only on such a basis that a oomprehensive and right policy can be established. This policy must take into account, much more than in the past, the facts relating to physical conditions and traffic needs. When understood and accepted it will permit and promote in the state a highway improvement ranging from trail to permanent road but adapted to all the conditions and needs of the various localities and of the state as a whole. </seg>
            <seg id="p340">340 IKIH L£01M,S NKBKASKA Sliit. HUAKV Of Al. UK I I II UK Better Results for the Money Large amounts are voted for roads, yet many citizens are not satisfied with the results. The unsatisfactory condition, though usually over - drawn, deserves the consideration that will tend to put all public road work on a firm business basis. The ideal should be that townships, counties and the state should be repaid in good road service, the equivalent, dollar for dollar and with interest, for all tax money expended. The road administration should be democratic and efficient but not overshadowed by politics. Persons competent for the work in the differ - ent branches and departments should be employed and no othws. Those working for the public in these capacities should be more permanent and serve as efficiently as if they were employed by private parties. Better economics in road work, including construction, maintenance and administration will overcome some of the opposition to road taxation and improvement. It will tend to decrease taxation and will promote a higher degree of confidence in public service generally. Township, County and Community Development Road funds are derived largely from assessments made by townships and counties. The funds needed vary greatly. In some locations road building is simple, in others difficult and expensive. Township meet - ings and county commissioners determine levies except in cases of spe - cial elections. Township and county units have importance in road de - velopment in Nebraska. There are many communities in which addi - tional funds and work are secured through the efforts of public spirited citizens. This is done under the leadership of farmers' organizations and commercial clubs. Town and country unite to improve roads leading to a community center. This brings larger improvement than can be secured from the township and county funds alone. Much of the state has been covered in this way. Among the centers leading in the work are Alliance, Chadron, Norfolk, Gothenburg, Kearney, Nelson, Geneva. Lexington, Humboldt, Exeter, Grand Island, Seward and Fremont. This list could be extended to include a large number of places. The com - munity development results not only in improving traffic conditions but it develops ro-operation in these centers. State Roads Just what is to be done in building inter county or state roads in Nebraska remains a problem. Traffic does not stop at township, county or community lines. It reaches over larger areas, often across several counties and state lines. The condition of roads varies much by counties. It is particularly noticeable that a road may change at once from good to bad at a county </seg>
            <seg id="p341">I 1:0. 1 mum..-. .NKKKAKKA MTATK r.u.\lili i&gt;l Ai.KU I 1.1 I 111. 341 line. Construction and maintenance ot dirt roads are well standardised in some counties but not in others. Community development does not necessarily fit into inter-county and state plans. The result is a road condition which has been called, "good, bad and indifferent." This con - dition is being corrected to some extent by the work of road associations. The tendency Is to improve the leading roads with a degree of uniformity. The results attained show possibilities in the way of permanent roads be - tween the larger centers. This development, if carried out, would give good highways where most needed and some of them would have inter - state and national importance. Among the well known roads are The Lincoln Highway, The Omaha- Lincoln-Denver Highway, The Omaha-Kansas City Highway and The Meridian Highway. None of these is in good condition throughout the year. The counties and communities, practically unaided by the state and federal departments, have not been able to meet the conditions imposed by heavy traffic. The state does not have funds for co-operation. So here are two practical problems: The first to determine what assist - ance the state is to give, in coordinating and extending the county and community work: and the second, to raise the necessary state funds to support the project. Colorado leads Nebraska in improving the Lincoln Highway and the Omaha-Lincoln-Denver Highway. One reason for this may be that Colo - rado is more of a tourist state. The condition of these roads is plainly evident to tourists who never fail to contrast the conditions of these roads in the two states. Nebraskans are not fully convinced that tourist travel is a resource and that good roads develop this resource. An awakening in this respect is coming, however, with the increase of travel on our interstate high - ways. This is due to the presence of many autos from other states, especially in the summer. The tourists patronize our garages, hotels, restaurants and stores. They spend thousands of dollars in the state and receive impressions, both favorable and unfavorable, which they compare with other states on the highways. 1 would not go too far in urging road improvement because of its relation to the publicity derived from tourists, but I would maintain that tourist travel is becoming of greater importance and that the need for inter-county and state roads is growing. State Highway Commission Nebraska has a Department of Irrigation Highways and Drainage, and an Advisory State Highway Commission. These departments render valuable service in a number of capacities, yet many citizens are not aware that such services are performed. The Advisory Highway Com - mission has a principle duty, authority over the routing and marking of the leading highways. The State Engineer, employed by the Department of Irrigation.

Co-Operation with Federal Department* Recent federal legislation provides a large fund for highways under the United States Department of Agriculture. The states are to co-operate in a movement which is intended to develop national highways. Ne - braska will be required to provide funds for co-operation if this plan is accepted. Some people oppose the project, whereas others are strong in its favor. The administration of the funds is to be by the State Highway Commissions and the Office of Public Roads and Rural En - gineering of the United States Department of Agriculture. The project should receive the thought of citizens for it calls for state funds and probably for levies by townships. Some counties under - taking to complete the work in a large way. may bond themselves. This should not be done too hurriedly and without consideration of the plans tried out in such states as New York, Pennsylvania, Alabama, Florida and Virginia. The most economic plan should be used and provision must be made for maintenance as well as for road construction. We do not know what support this movement for permanent roads is to receive in Nebraska. The matter should be decided definitely. If accepted, the state commissions will occupy a difficult position. Pressure will be brought to bear from many localities favoring the development of certain highways, all of which cannot be undertaken at once. This will foster dissatisfaction at places, but those in charge should art with a comprehensive view looking toward the general Rood of the state. The decision of our state to accept or reject this federal aid and co-operation rests with the legislature. The following should factor in the t decision: 1. Traffic. — Would such roads reduce the ooRt of haula would the investment pay on this account? 2. Land Value*. — Would they advance or lower pric would farmers view the matter? 3. School*. — Would they increase attendance, improve efficiency ar favor consolidation? 4. Community Development. — Effects upon social and rtligiou Health? Small towns? Cities? 5. The State and Nation. — What* relation and bow important Road Materials It is sometimes said that Nebraska is without road materials. Per - sons claiming as much do not appear to be fully conversant with the facts for there are several road building materials within our borders. The chief ones of these are sand, gravel, limestone and subsoil. The Platte </seg>
            <seg id="p343">1-tCOl EEDlMiS NRHKANRA STATE HOARD OK AUB1CLLTLKK 343 Republican, Loup and Klkliorn valleys are underlain with thick deposits of sand suited for road making. The big dredges of the Platte supply a vast amount of this material not only for Nebraska but for use in western Iowa, northwestern Missouri and northeastern Kansas. A number of quarries are operated, producing principally crushed stone. The leading centers are Meadow, Louisville, Cedar Creek, Nehawka and Blue Springs. The state has twenty-nine distinct limestone ledges, a thick formation of chalk rock, and a number of deposits of the so-called magnesia rock, the latter occurring principally in the central and western counties. Nearly every part of the state can be served by local deposits of sand and by some stone. The state surveys have determined the distribution and qualities of these materials. Tli principle road building material in Nebraska is the subsoil of . Inch there are many kinds. The chief subsoils of the southeastern all of the state are silt loams. These occur on the uplands and on the erraces of the principle valleys and are easily graded and dragged, niak - ng hard roads. The Platte and other principle valley floors contain a lariety of subsoils ranging from clay to sandy and gravelly loams. In these situations it is necessary" to use care in the selection and mixture of materials in order to build uniform roads. Otherwise, there are clayey, sandy or gravelly stretches. The sand hill region and its outliers, occupy - ing some 20,000 square miles has four leading soil J.ypes. but the one with largest areal distribution is dune sand. This blows badly when the (Trass cover is destroyed. Straw, hay, grass and other materials must be used as a cover at the blow places. Grading and dragging are not feasible, except where the ground is hard. There are some thirty kinds of subsoil in the High Plains region of western Nebraska. These range between clays, silts, fine sandy loams, sand, gravel and partly weathered stone. Some stretches of road remain good without much work, others require careful selection of materials, grading and dragging. The so-called magnesia rock when spread upon a road surface makes it smooth and hard. The road materials of our state are being surveyed, mapped, tested and described by the State Conservation and Soil Survey in co-operation with the Engineering College of the University and the State Engineer. To date the subsoil of more than twenty counties has been surveyed in detail Kinds of Permanent Road Experimental roads have been built in a number of states. The fed - eral department has constructed them at several places as In the vicinity of Washington. U. C. The object has been to determine the kinds best suited to the different needs. Our state should profit by this experience. Enough has been learned in the way of building and standardizing roads to supply the public generally with a vast amount of Information. The experience gained with this and the literature connected therewith </seg>
            <seg id="p344">344 PKOCKEMKUS NhBKASKA 8TATK UUAIU) Ut ACkR ULTLRK has made advocates of sand roads, oiled roads, cement roads and rock roads. No doubt most advocates are sincere in their belief, yet some may be selfish, hoping to secure the sale of such materials as stone, sand, brick or cement. Persons actually representing the state must be free from all such bias and it would seem that when the time comes for extensive permanent road building the different communities should be ready and willing to accept technical information concerning the materials and types of construction that best serve the traffic needs. Causes and Prevention of Accidents The state is facing the problem of an increasing accident and death rate on the public highways. The courts are occupied with suits brought against counties and the number of these is also increasing. The situation is becoming alarming. The accidents are caused in several ways but practically all of thest could be prevented. Some are due to road conditions, including bridges others to teams and defective machines, but most are caused by reckless driving. Heavy traffic of recent years and especially with autos has brouglii a condition difficult for road commissioners to meet. It is a new situation. Hills must be planed down, grades widened, culverts lengthened, bridges widened, markers erected and in some cases the highways policed. This need for construction and maintenance cannot be met at once with the funds available. Let us summarize a few of the things causing accidents, and point out method of prevention. 1. Narrow Grades: These present dangerous conditions by caring, the skidding of cars and wagons after rains, and in being too narrow to permit passing. The condition can be remedied but at great expense. Drivers should exercise exceptional laution un such grades. 2. Sharp Hill Crests: Many accidents are caused by the coll sion of rapidly moving autos at hill tops. This can be prevented by grading the hills downward, widening the cuts and by more care - ful driving. Making the hills at a high rate of speed is dangerous. 3. Short Culverts: The last legislature passed a law requiring the lengthening of culverts so that teams and autos may puss. This legislation requires also the erection of white posts at the ends of culverts. Though the step is in the right direction, some of the counties do not have the necessary funds to complete the work, hence the public should not be overly critical with these counties because the improvements can be made when funds are available. Furthermore, we should not expect lone: culverts, on highways carrying little traffic. </seg>
            <seg id="p345">345 ru«" USUINUH NBMAMKA HTATK IMIAKH &lt;i| m.iiii I I'll i:k Narrow Bridges: Traffic along the principle highways demands bridges wide enough for passing teams and autos. The actual construction of these must necessarily be delayed because of the great expense and drivers should be careful. t Zig Zag Bridget: Not many of these are left in the state, yet it is plainly evident that safety demands the reallignment of such structures. Rushing for Bridges: This is one of the worst features of reck - less driving. It has resulted in a number of collisions and several deaths. This kind of driving is not an act of sportnianship and it would seem that those so careless should be denied the privi - lege of the road. The driver should slow up especially when meeting others at bridges. It is a good plan to let the other fellow pass first. Speeding and Racing: The state law places a limit of 25 miles per hour on autos, yet practically every driver breaks this limit and the law of the state. The fact is that recklessness should be guarded against more than fast driving. Some counties, as a result of practical experience, make the limit thirty-five or forty miles per hour, allowing for the skill of the driver and the con - ditions of the machine and road. Speeding and racing are danger - ous under most conditions and should be stopped. Drunkenness: Herein is a positive element of danger, quite evi - dent in some parts of the state. It is the cause of damage suits now pending in the courts and has contributed largely to the list of fatal accidents. Persons addicted to drunkenness should not lie permitted to drive autos on the public highways thereby en - dangering tlie lives of themselves and others. Railroad Crossings: Crossing railroad tracks without due caution is one of the leading causes of accidents in our state. Reports of such are frequent in the daily press. Some railroads are poorly marked, a condition which must be remedied. Drivers should be on the watch ; they should slow up at railroads and look both ways with care, before crossing. Courtesy and Politeness The consideration given autoists by farmers in Nebraska is a notice - able feature. They drive well to one side in order that machines may pass. The hindrance to farmers hauling heavy loads is very annoying when many machines are encountered. The polite thing for the chauffeur to do in every case of this kind is to acknowledge the favor. "Thank you," is in order. It expresses appreciation and manliness. Some drivers fail to signal when passing teams. Rushing by skittish horses and taking people unawares is one of the frequent discourtesies of Jhe road. </seg>
            <seg id="p346">346 mtM'KKltlMiS .YfcUKANKA STATK IMIABU u» Al.llll I I I I ill The autoist should be thoughtful not only of farmers and teams but also of fellow autoists. This thoughtfulness is expressed in assistance to those having car trouble. Auto drivers should express appreciation for all favors shown them on the highways and at garages. Garage Service and Charges The garage business has sprung up so rapidly that service and charges have not yet been standardized. Some places give polite and efficient services whereas others keep patrons on the waiting list. Some make excessive charges; others are more reasonable. Our state can well afford to improve Its garage service especially along the main highways and in the larger cities. Such will have increasing importance in the future. Road Maps The State Conservation and Soil Survey is mapping the state as rapidly as possible, consistent with good work. These maps show .oils. topography, houses, railroads, wagon roads and towns. Some data ar&lt;&gt; also supplied on local history and industries. Such Information am! the maps will be published for general use Road Marking The roads of some states are poorly marked. This Mat venient and difficult for travel. Nebraska ranks well in rued mark yet the public should show additional interest and helpfulness to the that the right ensignia may bo adopted for the various rout ivork must be brought to a high degree of standardization. It ■Utill select colors simply to show the location of a route. Tlu other markers should express something of importance concerning our state. For example, a road is to be routed and marked between Marys - ville Kansas and Sioux City, Iowa. There is much interest in this high - way. It traverses a part of the corn belt of Nebraska. Our citizens are called Cornhuskers so among the names proposed for this route the one "Cornhusker" seems most appropriate. The majority of persons con - sulted favor the colors white and yellow, representing the two principle kinds of corn grown in Nebraska, which is a good choice. The Omaha-Lincoln-Denver Highway is marked by a band of white bordered with black. A better color scheme would have been scarlet and cream, representing the University of Nebraska and the spirit of the state. The Lincoln Highway has for its colors, red, white and blue, the most appropriate selection of them all. These examples are given to show that the ensignia used on Nebraska highways should have the fullest possible meaning. Though many of the highways have been marked by public spirited citizens and some of the routings and markings have been passed upon favorably by the Advisory Highway Commission, there will </seg>
            <seg id="p347">I'HOCEfcW.MiS NEBRASKA STATE IDIAKII hi Al.KHll.TlKK 347 come a time when they must be revised according to a uniform plan. We have not done enough in marking distances between towns, in showing county ltnes and places of historic interest. Mileage Reduction It seems, as trattit increases between the principle centers and on the interstate roads, that the mileage should be decreased where possible, in order to reduce the expense of construction and maintenance, to eliminate sharp turns and accidents resulting therefrom, and to conserve time. For example, the road distance between the two leading cities in the state is about 65 miles with several sharp turns and railroad crossings. This distance could be reduced at comparatively small expense to less than 60 miles and at the same time eliminate certain elements of danger. What is true here is also true at other points. The total mileage of interstate roads such as the Lincoln Highway and the Omaha-Lincoln-Denver Highway, can be reduced by routing them together where possible. A comprehensive plan covering the distribution of the main roads will be largely governed, when determined, by the tratflc needs as shown by careful surveys. This routing will give the best results to the state as a whole and with the least mileage. Confidence and Co-Operation If we view the matter correctly there appears to be a lack of con - fidence and co-operation in the road situation in Nebraska. There is mis - understanding at places between county and town, yet the community de - velopment is removing this barrier. The value of good roads in the country proper has paramount impor - tance in Nebraska, yet not all farmers and town folk on the smaller arteries of travel realize the importance of the fact that their roads lead out to highways with more traffic and that these in turn reach the paved streets and large centers of population. There is no break along the line. All are public roads whether in good or bad condition or in large or small communities. They are related parts of what should be a more perfect development. County lines bar none. The big road problem of Nebraska is involved in the relationship of township, county and state work. We have three inter-related units somewhat out of adjustment. Some maintain that all road work should be placed under a central or state administration whereas others would decentralize, retaining only the township unit. Here are two extremes, and it seems that, if put into effect, either would be equally bad at this time. This problem can be solved without much change and with little legis - lation. Most roads might remain under township and county administra - tion, and those of greatest state and interstate importance could be placed </seg>
            <seg id="p348">348 PSOCCKIUMJS .NKBUAHKA STATE BOAKIl UK AUKK ULTl'KE under state control. The State Highway Department would be required as now, to supply certain kinds of useful advisory data to the township and county work. This would serve to unify and standardize the system. But how are we to meet the expense of state roads? It cannot be met by township and county levies alone. There must be funds for this purpose, supplied by the state. There is a growing need for permanent state and interstate roads. They would have local use, would serve as interurbans, for tourists, and for national purposes. It is evident, however, that there must be a better understanding than we now have, together with added confidence before anything worth while can be accomplished in this line in Nebraska. The time was when such subjects as convict labor and the bridge interests held our attention. Now convict labor is a road resource and the bridge matters are in better condition. One after another of the dis - cordant problems has been solved, giving a better understanding, greater confidence and a higher degree of co-operation. This spirit and under - standing when more fully developed should produce a workable plan for highway improvement, a plan supported by all interests including those of county, state and nation. MAKING MUTTON WITH SILAGE By A. G. Kittell Silage has proved to be the determining factor in making sheep feed - ing uniformly profitable for Fred Bartels of Dakota county, Nebraska. Mr. Bartels is the most extensive feeder of lambs in the northeastern corner of Nebraska, tributary to the Sioux City market. His farm is 9 miles southwest from Dakota City, between the towns of Homer and Hubbard. On this farm of 360 acres he has fed as many as 15,000 sheep in one winter. This winter his flock is considerably below the average, only 2,600 being in the feedlots the last week of January. This decrease in numbers is due partly to the high price of feeders last fall and the short - age of the 1915 corn crop. It would be difficult to find a more pronounced silo enthusiast than Fred Bartels. In fact he is so enthusiastic over silage feeding that his neighbors declare he is a crank on the subject. To some of them his ideas and methods are rank heresy. They might be questioned too by the scientific man at the University Farm, but he keeps right on topping the sheep market at Sioux City and Omaha, and every now and then the news goes out that Fred Bartels has bought another piece of land. All of which takes the edge off any criticism directed toward his methods of management, whether wrong or right. One of his most flagrant violations of the farming creed for that part of the state is his attitude towards alfalfa. He grew some of it at one </seg>
            <seg id="p349">349 I'KIH ttUl.MiS NLBKA8KA bTATt BUAKD Of AUKKULTUKt time but now there is not an acre on the place. Corn is favored because it will produce a greater tonnage of fattening forage to the acre. Corn will grow 8 to 15 tons of silage an acre, while the best alfalfa will do is 4 to 5 tons an acre. So why alfalfa, he argues. What protein feed is necessary to balance the ration for the lambs is supplied by a small allowance of oil meal, and also of "alfalfa fat," a mixture of alfalfa meal and molasses. Besides providing the needed protein, Mr. Bartels declares they serve as appetizers and keep the animals' digestive organs in good working order far better than would alfalfa hay. From 1,000 to 1,200 tons of silage are fed annually on the Bartels farm to sheep and cattle. This silage is supplied by three large silos on the place. These silos not only are filled in the fall at the regular season, but just as soon as one is emptied it is refilled with dry corn fodder, moistened plentifully as it goes into the silos. Mr. Bartels says there is no comparison between corn stalks fed dry from the shock, and the same feed properly siloed. Under no circumstances will he feed the shock corn while there is silo room. Naturally there is a difference in quality of feed between silage made from corn at the proper time, and that siloed from the shock, but according to Mr. Bartels this difference is only a traction of what the average man would suppose it to be. Cattle and sheep show very little preference for the green silage and they clean up the dry silage just as they would the other except at finishing time when they get a heavy allowance of corn. Then they will leave a portion of the pulpy stalks. By sprinkling a little salt over this silage he finds the stock will clean it up much better than otherwise. The sheep will eat this silage before they will touch alfalfa hay. The corn for the regular silage crop is cut just as the ears are dent - ing. No corn is left down over night if it can be helped, but is run through the machine and into the silo with as little loss of time as possible. When all three silos are filled the binders are started again, and from 30 to 40 acres of corn are cut and shocked up. When a silo is emptied, it is refilled at once from this shock corn. Last year the last silo was filled April 10. This dry corn is cut up with the same silage cutter used during the regular silage season. Large quantities of water are used in siloing the dry corn. A small stream is run into the cutter to kill the dust without which it would be impossible for a man in the silo to exist very long. Then a 1%-inch stream is run into the silo to thoroughly saturate the silage as it is packed in. The wetting and chemical action gives the silage properties and a feeding value that it never would have had in the form of dry fodder. Mr. Bartels says the average man unacquainted with the silage, would not believe it possessed the succulence and palatability that it does. The sheep fed on this farm are bought about the middle of October to the first of November. In his earlier years of sheep feeding Mr. Bartels bought his feeders out on the ranges of Montana and Wyoming. In late years he has found he could do better by buying them right in tin 1 yards of Sioux City as they come in off the range. He found that the </seg>
            <seg id="p350">350 IKtHKKUINliS .NKBKAhKA HTATfc 1IOAKII Of AUK1LUL1 X'Kt saving in time and expense of traveling over the range looking for sheep, more than overbalanced any advantages this plan might have had over buying right at home. While they may cost a little more at the yards he has no freight to pay and no shrink to lose. The price cannot be so much higher either for he has on occasions picked up thin ewes for as little as 50 cents apiece. Many of the animals bought are anything but promising in appearance after a long overland journey, but a few weeks of feeding works a wonderful transformation. As soon as these feeders are received on the farm they are turned out to clean up the fields. At this time there still is a considerable amount of green picking, and they also finish up the wheat sown for pasture directly after harvest. They have the run of every field except where there is corn, as every acre of the farm is fenced sheeptight. Mr. Battels believes it is a mistake to turn sheep into unhusked corn as some feeders do. He says they cannot help wasting some corn and so long as there is any in the field they will trample over all the rest of the feed without noticing it. When the corn is out the sheep are turned in to finish up the field and they certainly do a clean job of it. The sheep are left out in the fields as long as weather will permit, which in Mr. Barters estimation is a good, lone time. Except when there are sharp, biting winds, or r&gt;Hz - zards, he believes sheep or cattle are better off out in the open than if closely yarded. When shelter is needed, open sheds or at least protection from cold winds, are available. The fencing around the fields is made of two strands of 26-inch woven wire, with a barb wire on top to tarn horses and cattle. Mr. Bartels prefers the two strands since this means a saving of fence and of work in repairing. Since the top of the fence always suffers most, the one strand can be removed for repairs, or replaced, while leaving the other on the posts. Such a fence also turns dogs and coyotes, but in spite of all precautions the coyotes find openings under the fence in draws and washouts, and whenevec they do, it is certain that some sheep will be found the next day with throats cut and torn. They are not always killed out - right, it seems. In some cases an animal has remained in the flock for several days after such an attack. But it is very seldom tlwt one finally recovers. Mr. Bartels finds dogs less of a problem than coyotes. The feeding of the sheep in the lots is governed by the amount of feed they pick up in the fields. As the feed becomes scarce and the weather colder, they receive an allowance of silage that is increased gradually until they get as much as they will clean up. The "alfalfa fat," already mentioned, is mixed in with the silage as this is put into the feed bunks a sack of 100 pounds to every load. This has a sweetening effect, making the silage more appetizing, besides supplying the elements needed to bal - ance the ration. Later on, toward the finishing period the oil meal is added. Mr. Bartels said he had tried alfalfa hay on several occasions and only recently bought a stack from a neighbor, but both sheep and cattle will hardly touch it unless the allowances of silage and corn are cut down sufficiently to make them eat it. This is where alfalfa gets its black eye </seg>
            <seg id="p351">riilH/LMMM.* 351 \tllUAM\.\ M.Wh l:nlllli llf M.liHI I 1 1 UK from Mr. Bartels. He figures that in feeding sheep or any other meat animal, successfully, the object should be to induce them to eat the largest possible bulk of fattening feed, and whatever the feed may be of which they can be induced to eat the largest quantity, that is the kind to give them. As the finishing period approaches in late winter or early spring the allowance of corn is increased and a little oil meal is added. Mr. Bartels says he has no hard and fast rules as to the quantities of either corn or silage to be given at any time during the feeding period. The condition of the flock, and its needs, as indicated by outward appearances, govern the amounts fed to them. The object is to feed all the animals can make use of profitably, but not to give them more than they will clean up promptly, or so much that they will be thrown "off feed." During the last week of January, when these facts were, obtained from Mr. Bartels, he was feed - ing a lot of 1,000 animals, 53 scoops of corn a day. He figured 3 scoops to make a bushel which would mean approximately 18 bushels, or an aver - age of about 1 pound to an animal daily, together with all the silage they &lt;'ared to clean up. Occasionally a part of the flocks may still be on the place when the shearing season has arrived. Such animals are sheared and while the fleece is quite valuable the market prices for shorn animals are enough lower so that it is about a standoff whether they are sold with or without the fleece. Shearing usually is done early in April, and once or twice has been tri.'d late in March, but this has been found too early. REARING THE WHOLE BROOD l'.y M. E. Dickson. University Kami. Lincoln. Nebr The degree of success attained in poultry raising is reckoned by the number of fowls raised. The number matured depends upon the vitality or strength of the individual chick to grow. The foundation for large hatches and strong chicks lies in the strength of the germ when the egg is laid. To produce strong germs means the selection of the old stock upon the same basis. Narrow chests, crow heads, weak legs and long hooked beaks indicate lack of vigor. Overfat hens, drooped behind, unless otherwise valuable as fancy birds, should be sold. Select pullets properly matured, showing good comb development. Infertility and poor hatches in the early spring in most cases are due not to low vitality, but to improper handling of the stock through the winter. Very often the birds are crowded badly, and in some cases fer - tility is impaired by such practices as feeding heavily on condimentals and meat feeds. Induce the birds to take exercise by feeding cracked grain morning and night in the litter. When the weather will permit, allow them </seg>
            <seg id="p352">352 I-IMH KtlUMiS NKIWAShA HTATK WIAKII of AI.HII II II n to run at large. Free MM to Hit- barnyard for at least a part of the day should be allowed. In milder weather, feed the birds in a bedding of straw outside the house. This practice hardens them, and is excellent for getting fertility. The lack of green feed is noted especially as one reason for poor fertility on some farms. Feed at least two grains, and provide a com - fortable, dry house. The natural method of incubation and brooding is all right, but in many cases has led to an entire shifting of responsibility to the hen to perpetuate the flock. The result is that chicks are hatched at any time and at all times; and in the fall many chicks weighing only a pound are offered to the market. Such chicks arc a nuisance on the farm and an not wanted on the market. This practice means chicks of all sizes at all times, which not only is bad business management, but actually makes more work. If natural incubation is to be practicrd with the least loss, one should set as many hens at one time as possible and divide the total chicks among the best mothers, repeating this operation as many times as necessry, until the desired number of chicks are hatohfd. Shorten the hatching period as much as advisable, and in so doing the chicks will be more nearly of the same size. This not only makes feeding and handling more simple, but reduces the loss of chicks killed by belligerent hens and also adds to uniformity and value at market time. What is true about natural incubation is true also about the artificial method. Many farmers' wives run the incubator all summer long. This is wrong, and in so doing the best advantage of the incubator is obliterated. If you are using an incubator and it is too small, better get another and systematize your raising of the chick crop, the same as any other crop. Start as early as you wish if the eggs are fertile and you will find much of the usual worry and "hard luck" dropping out. Many times one cannot get sitting hens early enough, and the result is immature stock in the fall. These are not layers and should not be bred from. In natural incubation it is a good plan to start at least two hens at a time. If more than one variety of chickens is kept, mix the eggs, so that at the time of dividing the chicks every lien will have a mixed lot of colors. This often saves some unnecessary killing. Select eggs uniform in size and color. In cold weather, place too few rather than too many eggs under the hen. Use a shallow nest that is sufficiently wide so the hen will not have to jump on the eggs when returning. Round off all corners and fill up the holes into which the eggs might roll. Place the box on the floor, and for the purpose of supplying moisture to the eggs it is well to place a fresh piece of sod in the bottom, roots upward. Either dust the hen or grease her with a little blue ointment below the vent, to rid her of lice. Be careful to use only a small amount and that none gets on the eggs. Blue ointment may be bought at any drug store. This preparation not only kills the live lice at the time of ap - plication, but also is sufficiently lasting to completely rid the hen of young lice when they hatch. In this respect one application of this is </seg>
            <seg id="p353">353 rKOOEEDI.NGS .NE8BASKA STATE BOARV Ol A6UCULTUBS hftti-r than a similar treatment with dusting power. Provide a dust bath, also plan' sonif water beside the next within easy reach, In warm weather. Feed the sitting hen only \vhol ■ grains, and a little green feed. Keep the nest clean and take all necessary precautions to protect the hen from rats and dogs. About the fourteenth day, and again the eighteenth, it is a good plan to sprinkle the eggs with warm water. When the chicks begin to hatch, be on hand to see how the hen will "take to them." If she is malicious give the chicks to another. In making the change from nest to brood coop, it is a good plan to wait until the noon of the twenty - third day and at that time give them their first feed. Do not attempt to feed in the nest. If convenient, place the brood coops in an orchard, or at least where there is some shade and at the same time in the open. Move the coop every other day or so to provide clean quarters and fresh green feed for the hen. Never place the coop in bushes or near old buildings where rats, cats and other prowlers may hide unnoticed. Trees give protection from hawks and crows. Along the edge of the cornfield is an excellent place for the coops. Keep the hen confined for the first two weeks or till such a time as you feel it will be safe to allow the chicks to run with the hen in the tall grass. Do not allow the hen to run loose in bad weather. Head lice kill large numbers of chicks every year. Grease the head of every chick once a week for the first four weeks, with common petro - leum or vaseline. Do not use blue ointment for this purpose. Mites are commonly known to be the worst pests of chicks. They are red, spider - like creatures and infest all brood coops. Spray coops once a week with common kerosene plus 15 per cent crude carbolic acid until entirely rid of them. It is a good plan to protect the hen at night by partly closing up the front of the house. Arrange a sliding board for convenience. Hatching With Incubators. In artificial incubation the responsibility rests entirely upon, the de - pendableness of the operator and the incubator used. There are many good machines on the market, and the price is within the reach of every farmer. The results obtained are warranting their use, and the chicks when properly handled are equal to those hen hatched and reared. Some persons hatch artificially and rear naturally, but as a common thing the brooder is an accompaniment of the incubator. On the ordinary farm it takes 14 pounds of grain to raise a 4-pound cockerel. This, at $30 a ton, would cost 21 cents; the original cost of the egg, 3 cents; and kerosene for incubation about 2 cents; making a total of 26 cents. The bird should bring 50 cents on any market; which leaves a profit of 24 cents. As a general rule, "the price received for the cockerels offsets the cost of raising the pullets." Eggs will average a hatch of 50 per cent cockerels and 50 per cent pullets. We generally figure, in starting an incubator, to allow three </seg>
            <seg id="p354">354 1'WHtJJHMlh NHU1ASK A MT.ITK l;.Hl:n in A«ikl&lt; I I I I «► eggs (or one chick matured. The cockerels are a by-pruduct of the busi - ness and should be produced and sold when weighing l' pounds, and as early as possible to derive the highest price. It is well to hold back a few of the most promising cockerels for next year's breeders; but as h general thing too many are held. Such practice is poor business economy in the face of a falling price. A 2-pound bird in early spring is worth the price paid for a 4-pound bird in the fall. Hold only what is needed for the table and breeders and sell the rest. When the chicks begin to hatch in the machine do not disturb them. Allow them to sleep, and encourage this by pinning a heavy paper over the front of the machine, thereby darkening it. This sleep is very essential in the finishing of the hatch. The temperature will probably go to 104 degrees or 10f&gt; degrefs. This is because of the animal heat given off in hatching. A temperature higher than this is harmful. In incubators having no nursery tray, it is advisable at the dose of the hatch to open the door and remove the broken egg shells. If the machin has a nursery tray, make certain it is sufficiently close to the egg tray s&lt;i that chicks will not be injured in falling from one to the other. An ex - amination of dead chicks often reveals an enlarged yolk sac still in tie abdomen of the chick. This may be caused either by a twisting in tli umbilicus which prevents the yolk from being absorbed, or by beginning to feed too early, in which case the feai in the crop is digested and the yolk sometimes remains unabsorbed. In either case the apparent evidence leads us to conclude the cause of death. Where chicks crowd at the door and pant, it is an indication of high humidity and a lack of air. If such a condition prevails at the close of the hatch, open the door about one-eighth inch and gradually harden them off. All chicks should be hatched out at the close of the twenty-first day. Those eggs not. receiving enough heat will be the last to hatch, and as ;t rule these chicks are rather weak. Those receiving more heat will hatch sooner. When the chicks are ready to be changed to the brooder, take special care not to chill them. The brooder receiving them should be at least as warm as the incubator — a little warmer will do no harm The chick will seek a comfortable temperature. In making this change, use a basket or box containing a soft cloth to throw over them. Always warm the hands, and in handling the chicks never squeeze them. Use as a litter, clover rouen or some such light material. Hank all the corners until round, to prevent crowding and packing in them. Have the litter about two inches deep. At night always replace what has been scratched away during the day, and at Mm same time slope it up away from the brooder. This breaks floor drafts. Provide sufficient heat to have the chicks five or six inches out away from the hover and well spread out. This heat is for reserve purposes and meets a declining temperature during the night. Bed the brooders at the last feeding time, be on hand again at dusk to put them to bed, and again about 10 o'clock p. m. </seg>

Both ground feed and whole grain seem to be necessary for the best growth of chicks. Ground feed mixed with milk Kivcs more returns than the same amounts fed dry. Dry mash fed in large rain-proof hoppers lessens labor expense. Hopper feeding is indis - pensable after chickens are eight weeks old. Before this, hand feeding is best.

MAKING THE POTATO CROP PAY By Arnold Martin, Pawnee County, Nebraska Potatoes have been the money making crop on my small farm of twenty acres. My success has been due largely to careful selection of the land which was covered with timber and brush when it came into my possession. The soil was rich, well drained, part alluvial and sandy loam, with an abundance of plant food in it. Special care in the selection of seed, in the cultivation of the crop, keeping up the fertility with clover, alfalfa, or barnyard manure and some commercial fertilizer in late years, with irrigation where needed, have all been factors in making potato grow - ing a profitable business for me. I believe in deep plowing, letting the ground lit- rough through the winter so as to catch the snow and stop the soil from washing. I let nature do the pulverizing and settling of the soil for it is done better and cheaper that way than I can do it. As soon as the frost leaves the ground, in the last days of March, or the first days of April, I plant my potatoes. I want my potatoes to sprout in the ground, not in the pile, or in the cellar. I use pieces with from one to three eyes, from smooth well shaped, medium to large potatoes. Instead of following the usual plan of going to the bin in the spring for my seed potatoes, after the housewife has been selecting from it all winter for her household needs, I select my seed from the field. I go through the patch when the plants are in full growth and study the growth and vigor of the vines. By this method of selection, I have been able to greatly increase my yields. I find also that in this way, we can breed out the present tendency toward blight and other diseases. I plant four Inches deep, dropping the seed twelve to fourteen inches apart in the row with rows three to four feet apart. 1 prefer hand plant - ing, marking out the rows with a lister or a plow and covering with a cultivator by taking off the two outside shovels. This leaves a shallow furrow between the rows. One cultivation and a harrowing are given before the potatoes see daylight. The last harrowing is given just before they break through the ground. This helps to control the weeds, retains the moisture, leu in the air, and makes plant food available for the young plants. A deep cultivation is given as soon as I can see the row, following this with a weeder or harrow a few days afterward. This stirs the soil In the rows and between the plants, keeps the weeds down and soon the plants shari&lt;' the ground. </seg>
            <seg id="p357">357 rmXLEDl.NUK NtBKASKA STATE BOAKU OK AGRICULTURE Shallow cultivation is kept up until the crop stops growing. Cultiva - tion of potatoes is very important. It must be shallow, not more than two inches deep in the last part of the growing season. The roots have then grown across the rows passing through the soil in search of food. Deep cultivation will destroy these roots and cut down the feeding capacity of the growing' plant in the most critical time. The old rule was to stop cultivation when the potatoes were in bloom. It was all right to quit then with the tools we formerly had for cultivation, but now we have imple - ments that will cultivate shallow and not injure the roots. Late varieties of potatoes with a longer growing season will outyield i-arly sorts, under favorable conditions, the same as corn will. But in a period of five years they will not do this. The early maturing variety will be the best yielder and the safest money making crop. I grow as many varieties of potatoes as I can get hold of — from twenty-five to forty in some seasons. I depend on the seed houses for many varieties, but one drawback has been that I can never get them early enough in the spring. When I do get them they are in no better condition than my own, well kept, home grown seed. It would be a good investment in the average com - munity for the farmers to go together and get their seed early in the spring for early planting. Varieties must be chosen that are adapted to the locality, especially where rainfall is not abundant. This often makes a great difference in the yield. For eastern Nebraska, Bliss Triumph, Irish Cobbler, Eureka, and Early Ohio are the best yielders for early varieties. Early Ohio will lead these four in a period of ten years. In growing potatoes for the home market, Bliss Triumph will take the lead. The crop is ready by June 1 to 10, thus coming in competition with the southern grown pota - toes. The potatoes will sell for from 3 cents to 5 cents a pound. Market them then and plant the ground to some other crop for the remainder of the season. Eureka, Irish Cobbler, and Early Ohio should follow later. The market always is good for home grown potatoes of quality from June 1 to October 1. Quite often my potatoes go from the store back to the farm. Car loads of potatoes have been shipped into the towns of South - eastern Nebraska in late years that could have been produced just as well in this territory. Hundreds of acres of brush timber land is lying idle which would make excellent potato ground. The average farmer does not give the potato a fair chance. This is one reason why the yield is decreasing and the seed is running out. To my mind there are few vegetables that have as wide a range of adaptability as the potato. There is no plant which is used as much by both rich and poor as the potato. The potato bugs have full control in many patches on the average farm. To control these pests, a sprayer is necessary. The orchard and potato patch on the average farm never see a sprayer because the farmer feels that he does not have enough work to justify owning one. He does </seg>
            <seg id="p358">358 PMOCEBD1NG8 NEBKASKA STATE BOAKD Of AUBUTM I K&gt; not grow enough for bis own use and then he pays a bonus to some neigli bor who sprays, for the fruit and potatoes he needs for his table. I have used nitrate of soda as a commercial fertilizer the last few years. I started in by experimenting on all kinds of crops. Most vege - tables and plants draw on nitrogen in their early growth. No matter how much manure we work into the soil there is a time in early sprint before the plant food from that source is available, when something else must be supplied. Nitrate of soda is a direct plant food that will assist the plant in early spring growth. I have a small Irrigation plant in use on my farm. I came to the con - clusion that when a man has learned when and how to apply water to his plants, that he is then no longer a slave to the elements. He is able to keep up the moisture supply at any time it is needed and will be well rewarded for his efforts. VALUE OF COW TESTING ASSOCIATIONS By E. 1). C'omstock. Jr., Merrick County On the east shore of the North sea is the little country of Denmark with an area less than one-fifth that of Nebraska, with only about ;!,500,0(H acres under cultivation. Denmark supports a population of over 1,900,00* and the dairy cow is largely responsible for this. During the middle of the nineteenth century devastating wars had practically bankrupted Denmark and when peace was finally gained tin - country turned to their agricultural sources to regain their national wealth. The dairy industry in this intensely cultivated country was just beginning to be improved and cow owners realized that in order to make a profit better cows must be bred and better methods must be followed. At) improved the first condition by importing new blood and crossing it on the best of their own stock. However, the Danes realized that pernian ent improvement could not be secured by breeding alone. It was the pro - duction of the dairy cow that meant wealth and the only way to increase production through breeding was by keeping records. Necessity often - times brings out the best in nations and peoples, and in systems of agriculture. Nebraska, with her great natural resources, is still blind to the wealth here for the asking, but in some far off time (and maybe not so far off either) her increased population will be driven to use better methods to increase production. Is it not too bad that we have to be driven into these ways? So Denmark, through necessity, began the keeping of permanent records of her dafry cows. A. M. Hansen was the first progressive dairyman to test his cows and keep records. The system proved so successful In increasing Dm produe- </seg>

Accordingly they started a system of co-operative testing, and not only milk records, but also records of feed consumption were kept. The system proved to be so valuable to the permanent improvement of the dairy cow that in 1895 Denmark organized the first cow testing association in order "to find and develop families of cows giving a rich yield of milk." Today Denmark has over 500 cow testing associations, and the average production of her cows has practically doubled. If the Cnited States should be blessed with such a condition, her dairy n-turns would add about one billion dollars annually to this nation's wealth. It would build a wall of butter so high on our eastern coast that no foreign warship could shoot over it and enough would be left over to give us agricultural instruction in our rural schools and a system of rioultural credit that would enable a young man to buy a farm and for it Tlic first cow testing association formed in America was in Newago county. Michigan, in 1905. It has been in continuous operation ever since and is one of the strongest in the United States. Five hundred people attended their annual picnic last summer and a large class of dairy cattle was exhibited. A special brand of community spirit was also ex - it ibi ted here that was ample proof of what co-operation will do for a people through the organization of a cow testing association. Thirty-one states have taken up this movement and now we have 211 associations in America testing about 110,000 cows. Nebraska is credited with three associations and two men handle the work as official testers. C. L. Kelsey is in charge of the central Nebraska association and S. A. Berger has the Lancaster and Gage counties association. Tin- object in organizing cow testing associations is to keep the milk production and feed consumption of dairy cows and in this way to weed out the unprofitable cows and show up unprofitable methods. You ask, "Where is the value?" I refer you to Denmark. I refer you to associations in this country which have greatly increased the pro - duction of cows. The cow testing association puts dairying on a business basis. The keeping of records year in and year out will bring permanent improvement by showing the farmer his unprofitable cows and per - mitting him to breed those which give high prices for feexl and labor. The association will teach the farmer better methods of feeding. The writer was in charge of the Douglas county cow testing association for a time and the truth came home to him very forcibly as to the value of these associations if properly conducted and supervised. You can get an organization formed, but if an incompetent tester is hired and if the experiment station forgets to supervise, the new-born association is bound to die and it will take several years to reorganize. I believe that in a few years dairy farmers in this state will fully realize the value of keeping records and will organize and run their own association just as they are now operating agricultural associations. </seg>

By J. O. Shroyer and A. G. Kittell Twenty-two societies and associations, agricultural in nature, met at Lincoln the week of January 17, and "talked shop." The attendance for tin week probably reached 2,000, and altogether it wax the most successful "Farmers' Week" held at Lincoln since this annual event was established. The meetings brought together the state's most successful men and women in agricultural lines — stockmen, grain growers, fruitmen, and homemakers. Their views, experiences, and opinions expressed in open meetings cannot help being interesting and helpful, and so they were this year just as they have been in all previous years. Added to this interchange of ideas were the addresses of speakers who are making a life study along special lines, and who are recognized authorities in their particular fields. The educational value of these gatherings can hardly be overestimated. Valuable Socially Too. But the educational value represents only one side of the benefits oi these annual gatherings. They have their social valu&lt;&gt; too for they offer n common meeting place for men and women from all parts of the state — the leaders in their respective communities. There is a social pleasure in renewing acquaintanceships year after year and in comparing notes on the experiences of the year past. Then there is the enthusiasm and public spirit developed, unconsciously perhaps, among those who meet for the good of worthy causes. To tell of all the things said and done that are worth the telling heiv. would have required the services of about twenty-two men, and a special number of the Journal, devoted entirely to this one topic. Which is out of the question. Two men were kept busy "hot footing" it between the buildings at the state farm or riding the street cars down town and back, in order to take in the things that looked most appealing on the program. The only dissatisfaction expressed about these annual meetings is that "there is too much going on at one time." No visitor could attend hair the meetings of special interest and it was a big problem for every indi - vidual there to decide what to take in and what to pass up. Stockmen's Meeting a Feature The stockmen's meetings were, as usual, the big feature of the week. No other event, except the State Pair, brings so many stock raisers together.

            <seg id="p361">361 I-WH'EEDI.NUS VKBHASKA STATE UUAKU OK AUHUXXTUBK hand In good numbers, and each group held its own sessions. Talks and discussions by t li« ■ cattlemen showed that their industry is feeling the hand of the packers more than ever before and that measures of relief soon will have to be adopted or the feeders will have to go out of busi - ness — broke. So strong was this feeling that a resolution was adopted favoring the curtailing of beef production and at the name time urging co-operation with other livestock organizations in an effort to get relief from the packers' monopoly through federal and state legislation. D. M. Hildebrand, of Seward, Neb., who is a feeder, suggested the establishing of an independent packing house by the cattle feeders themselves. While no definite action was taken his plan was well received and favorably discussed. Col. L. W. Leonard of Pawnee county called attention to the dangerous practice followed at the South Omaha yards, of loading and unloading cattle over the same chutes used in handling the hogs. It is a well known fact that many cholera hogs pass through the yards, which would make it an easy matter for contagion to be carried back to the farms on cattle shipped out for farther feeding. The "Americanized Percheron or the Percheronized American" was the topic that drew closest attention among the horsemen. We were told that it now takes 28 million horsepower to run the farms of our country and that the Percheron is growing every year into the ideal representative of that power. But we were told that after all our experience and the ex - amples of European nations, we are using more grades than purely-bred sires in the United States. ('. F. Curtiss, dean of the Iowa State college, made this statement and he further told us that Percherons in America were being made stronger, larger, more powerful and of cleaner action year after year. Surely those are the characteristics of the ideal draft hors ■ Another interesting statement made was that few of the horses passing through the sale rings now are black. Horse fashions demand other colors. Dean Curtiss says that our horses would have been better had we paid less attention to color. He accused the farmer of not being as good a feeder of young animals as he ought to be. He insisted that we did not grow out stuff well enough the first year or two of life. He said that if we did not grow the best yearling that we could, we never will grow the best finished horse that we should. The highest possibilities of the first year must be attained. Good Outlook for Horse*. In spite of the tractor fever that is sweeping the land he insisted that it was never more encouraging to grow the very best horses, than now. And he cited Nebraska as being one of the ideal places to grow that kind He further said that more tractor users had failed than had the growers of good horses.

Anderson, state veterinarian of Ne - braska, and L. W. Chase of the University Farm. The hog men were on the ground in good numbers and with a good stock of enthusiasm. C. Y. Thompson of West Point, and George Briggs of Clay Center gave two of the most practical addresses of the sessions. The "linen pin" of Thompson's argument was good breeds and good feeds. His methods while not all new, include the essentials of those best known. Raise gilts from mature sows, use well developed boars and breed toward a certain fixed type all the time, was his prac - tical advice. He said if you are starting with common sows, then tli« - boar should be more than half the herd. Many farmers starting with poor sows think that any old boar will do. but under those circumstances it is all the more our duty to use something better than an ordinary boar. Mr. Thompson is one of those men who believes in the hog-and-cattl&gt; j combination of harvesting the corn. He practiced what he preached by putting sixty-five steers and 100 hogs on the fields to husk his crop. He uses some individual 8 by 8-foot farrowing houses, 7 feet high, putting one or two of these in a lot. He keeps the sows separate from the rest of the herd. A long argument followed this talk and many successful plans were discussed. It was shown that 15 minutes a day was all the time spent caring for this big herd while on the cornfield, as it was necessary only to throw them a little alfalfa and see that they had free access to water. Mr. Thompson told us that he saved $10(1 in husking wages and board for men and many farmers coincided with him when h&lt; j declared that he lost no corn left in the field. Besides the manure was put where wanted and it saved the hauling. Sanitation Preventive of Worm* Professor Alford of the university gave a very helpful talk on worms and emphasized sanitation as a preventive. It is no easy task, h I declared, to eradicate the worm once it gets a good hold. The one - way in that case is to starve the pig forty-eight hours and give a strong medicine. He recommended copperas, blue vitriol, and turpentine for worms and suggested that to doctor them right they should be divided into lots of ten or a dozen. However, if the remedy is kept before them all the time it is not necessary to starve the hogs at any time. Salt should be accessible at all times. Self feeders of a small type are recommended in which to feed both grain and medicine. Anyone who wants the most modern and up-to - date plans for these handy conveniences should address Professor L. W. Chase, University Farm, Lincoln, and he will be pleased to send you plenty of free information of the latest kind along that line. </seg>

The state farm has many modern devices in practical use that will interest any farmer who will take the time to look them over. One of the speakers on the program that all Nebraska stockmen were particularly glad to 9ee and hear was H. R. Smith, formerly head if the animal husbandry department at the University Farm. He now is employed by a bank in St. Paul to encourage the raising of more livestock in the great northwest. Prof. L. A. Weaver of the Missouri Agricultural college was another speaker from out of the state who stave two talks that were well received. For thirty-one years the dairymen of Nebraska have been meet - ing in annual convention and their gatherings are among the principal events of "Farmers' Week." Unlike the men gathered in other groups, the dairymen said that most of their troubles were due to their own mistakes. They admitted that careless handling was largely to blame for the quality of their products and that no grading out, or only a per - functory grading, of the inefficient cows from a herd, kept down the profits. F. W. Bouska of Chicago showed that by the inefficient handling of &gt;ws, cream and butter, we get only the very highest price on 15 per ■nt of the butter that is marketed in this country. What a tremendous loss is represented in the 85 per cent of our butter that is sold for much less than it ought to bring. Study it from an epicurean standpoint and consider that out of every 100 pounds of butter you see on the market, 85 pounds smell badly, taste badly, or look badly, and you have a close insight on the present condition of butter production. This speaker said that we could produce better butter and cream if we wed more pure cold water in a farm method of refrigeration with - out ice. He and other experts testified that it did not take an ice plant or a high priced refrigerator to handle cream properly. They said the scientific investigations showed that the water cooled milk twenty-five times as fast as air and all that we had to do was to run the water pumped for stock through a trough in which the cream or milk was set. Like other producers, the dairymen find that their profit is the amount that stands between cost and selling price. Hence they exert every effort to reduce cost and one of the best ways to increase the selling price is to produce butter under more ideal conditions. They cannot understand why the farmer refuses to adopt those practices that will tend to make his product better. One Omaha creamery bought several hundred water cooling tanks at what they thought was a reasonable price. So far they have failed to induce a single customer to use one. The dairy speakers showed by maps that the strong nations of the earth were the people who drink milk and eat butter, and they are the peaceful nations too, just now. They declared that publicity was the life of the dairy business. </seg>
            <seg id="p364">■MH I'klH EElllXdK NKKKAKKA STATIC imAKIi Of MUUCWTVWK The fruit growers' gatherings were interesting as usual.. The hor - ticultural resources of the state were discussed by experts and Professor Condra portrayed them with his ever popular moving pictures. Tin - diseases of fruits were touched upon by H. F. Howard, of the University Farm, who discussed scab, blotch, and similar troubles. These diseases can be handled by well known spraying methods. Any one troubled with them can at any time obtain all that is necessary in the way of instruction from the university where the very best scientific and practical plans are studied and practiced, and then made available for the busy farmer or small fruit grower. L. 0. Williams of University Place, one of the speakers, has learned like others, that the marketing end is the equal of production. Mr. Williams has put in 20 years getting his experience with small fruits and he summed up a fine point when he declared that a 6-pound basket of fruit would sell for the same price that an 8-pound basket would bring, if the 6 pounds were put up in neat and attractive form and the 8-pound basket packed indifferently. He, like others, blamed our inefficiency to obtain good prices as due largely to careless preparation for market. He said that he found many persons who prefer home grown berries because they are fresh, but they buy those shipped in because of better selection and more careful handling and packing. Val Keyser, Nemaha county fruit grower, emphasized the fact that this marketing problem was largely in the hand of the grower himself and not entirely governed by supply and demand. He put three barriers to profit between the grower and the consumer — the speculator, whole - saler, and retailer. This gives us the impression that although our horticultural society is one of the oldest, and we certainly must aay. is composed of some of the brainiest men in Nebraska, they have been so engrossed in the science of production that they have forgotten the distribution end. But they now are on the right road, for they are hammering away at these three classes of middlemen, so that in tiim - we may see some of them eliminated. Mr. Keyser believes that the speculator injures the consumer, but not the producer. We disagree with him there, for whatever puts a fictitious or unnecessary cost on the articles a man has for sale, is sure to cause a reduction in demand and a restricted demand cannot help hurting the producer. But he got right down to facts in the next breath, for he put it plainly that a product that the grower cannot recommend does not deserve a market. Until you have the goods to sell there is no use to work up the commercial side. All over Nebraska we grow fruit and it takes as much ground to support a poor crop as it does a good and superior one. It takes almost as much time to prepare our products for the market in a slouchy way as it does in a good and neat manner. With a neat, attractive product a grower feels he has something he can stand back of and that he will be proud to recommend. We only wish that every farmer of whatever line could have heard </seg>

S. C. Basset of Gibbon, Neb., presented an appeal for the estab - lishment of a "Hall of Achievement" for this state. Certainly he could not find a better group of men to appeal to than the horticulturists. When we look back at the work of Pumas, Pollard, Harrison and the scores of others who have led us from the choke cherry and wild grape to the excellent fruit that filled the tables in the city auditorium, it would seem that there is good reason to erect a memorial of some sort in appreciation of their achievements. Those loaded tables of unexcelled fruits were in themselves a monument to the grand old men who, amid drouths, financial troubles, grasshoppers and innumerable discourage - ments, went on and on with their work of investigation until they gave us positive proof that we can produce any fruit here but those of the tropics, besides the many kinds of trees for shelter, ornament and fuel. We walk today in a Paradise here in Nebraska, compared with the land we found here 40 years ago. Nebraska can and should do something to commemorate the deeds of those grand old heroes. We love them and honor them, and so let us place a tablet in memory of their works, in this Hall of Achievement. Corn Improvement. The corn improvers held an exceedingly successful and interesting meeting and they had the demonstrations on the tables in the corn show to prove that they knew what they were talking about. The discussion that followed the talk of R. Hogue of Crete, Neb., brought out the argu - ment that the best place to dry corn for seed was right on the stalk, provid - ing the weather remained seasonable. The drying rack was commended and a simple way to make them was suggested, by driving three rows of 10-penny nails through each side of a 6-inch fencing board, fastened upright in a shed. Such a board will accommodate 200 ears and is the best plan we heard discussed. They told us to select good, solid ears for seed, which is good advice, but in some exhibits at the show that came close up to the top among the prize winners, were some rather loose ears. This caused one to wonder if the corn that wins prizes always is the best seed corn after all. The university score card was shown and explained. While we never have exhibited an ear at any show and can "see" corn only for its utility purpose, we would give "solidity of ear and of kernels on the cob" more than 5 points, as the score card has it. Any old farmer who goes to his crib to pick seed corn or picks it from the wagon, or if he goes into his field and carries it out on his back, selects an ear largely on that quality. We contend that the "feel" of an ear in the hand more than half determines its qualifications for the seed box. </seg>

They told us that the score card was no good to the experienced farmer picking seed corn; but we are of the opinion that it will not hurt any of us to get familiar with the fine points of corn breeding. As the fine points of a horse are best found by clos? measurements, so the fine points of a good ear can be found by scoring. Hut this need only be done on a few ears to accustom you to the type you are working for. Otherwise, I believe ever)' farmer can well take this card with him into the seed corn room and select the ears out of his pile laid away for next spring. It surely will tend toward a uniform type that he can keep in mind and in a few years he will establish a variety suited to his land, needs and fancy, for after all we will do our best with any animal, fruit or grain that strikes our fancy. We discovered that a lot of that field selection talk advocated by the seed corn experts has fallen on bare ground and that few of the men present followed their own suggestions. The wagon box selection at husking time is tin - way most of the careful work is done. The great cry among the corn experts last fall was for earliness. Ninety per cent of the corn in Nebraska is too soft for seed purposes. One might lay this to the exceedingly wet season, but it seems to be an outstanding fact that as corn improves in size, it tends toward later ripening in our state, especially in the southern part. • In this meeting the talk turned to other grains and a statisticiar told us that wheat, during long tests, had proved to be a more depend able money crop than any other grown on the farm. Discussed Plowing Deep and shallow plowing were discussed and, of course, we were told to plow deep. But some, apparently well established beliefs were assailed in these discussions. It has been shown by long test that the tapering ear will grow as large an acre yield as will the straight, cylindrical ear. So, after all this time spent in looking for nice straight ears, we are told that the unshapely, tapering style will do just as well. Corn styles, we suppose, are like fashions in women's clothes. Apparently the ear that can wear the tight skirt is coming on now. Another preachment that knocked all the science out of the dust mulch idea, was put on the boards. They told us that by keeping the weeds down or just scraping the surface, one could grow 40 bushels of corn on an acre. We learned also that the seed ears with the 14 - kernel rows will grow more on an acre than will the 18-row kind. The idea of 30 years ago, that three kernels to the hill is the right number, still prevails. Of course, the testing methods which scientific investigation </seg>

These programs were of particular interest to the women visitors, but usually a good sprinkling of men was noticed in the audience, and many of them were enlightened on certain points that it was good for them to know. One address, by Prof. H. B. Brownell of the university, was given for the sole benefit of fathers, and was really the only one on which we feel capable of com - menting intelligently. This speaker laid down some doctrines for fathers that if followed would scon raise the citizenship of this country to higher levels. This auxiliary organization of the women has made an excellent start and great things are expected of it in the near future. Corn and Apple Sh.ow The city auditorium in the downtown district of Lincoln was com - fortably filled with the exhibits of the corn and apple show .At night tliis hall was used for the showing of the state's moving pictures by Professor Condra of the university. The galleries provided plenty of seats for those who wished to see the pictures. The flower show brought out only a very small number of exhibits, but these of good uality The apple show was made up of 165 box samples and about 2,000 plates. The quality and appearance of the apples was well up to the standard and was somwhat of a surprise in view of the fact that the late varieties were hard hit by scab. The exhibitors were all well known Nebraska growers, who are demonstrating year after year that it is possible to grow the very best quality of apples in this state, and that there is money in it when done right. Most of the prizes were corraled by Marshal Brothers of Arlington, Keyser and Robinson of Nebraska City, and C H. Barnard of Table Hock.

Propps, Assistant in Dairy Extension, University of Nebraska The cow testing association project is a federal movement under the general supervision of the Dairy Division I'nited States Department of Agriculture, and practically the same plan is followed in every state. At the close of the last fiscal year there were, in the United States, about 350 active cow testing associations Wisconsin alone has fifty-two, and Iowa twenty-five. Nebraska has four such associations, located in Lan - caster, Merrick, Oage and Pawnee counties. In these four associations records are now being kept on about 800 cows. Purpose and Plan of the Association. — The main purpose of such an association is to furnish the man who milks a practicable and economical means of finding out Just what each cow in his herd is doing. To accom - plish this purpose, about twenty-six men, milking a total of about 400 cows form a co-operative organization; or, in communities where not enough cows can be secured to form a full association, a small associa - tion may be formed. Then two or more associations unite and operate together. A competent supervisor is then employed for twelve months. He spends one day in each month on each of the twenty-six farms. He weighs and takes a sample of milk from each cow, both morning and evening. The milk is then tested for butter fat and each cow is credited with the total amount of fat contained in the milk for that day. The </seg>
            <seg id="p369">369 FJWOEED1KW? .NEBRASKA STATE BUAJtU Of XHUtULTlWB feed for each cow is also weighed or estimated and she is charged for the total amount consumed in one day. These figures are then multiplied by the number of days in the month, thus giving the amount of fat produced and the amount of feed consumed in that month. Both the product and the feed is estimated at the market price. Deductions are then made for each cow, such as profit or loss, return for each dollar invested in feed, cost of producing a pound of fat, cost of producing a hundred pounds of milk, etc. When the supervisor has finished his work at each visit he leaves with the owner his association book, which shows exactly what each cow in his herd has done that month. The supervisor repeats his visit at each farm about the same time each month for twelve months. At the end of the year he totals the record of each cow for the twelve months and leaves with the owner a complete summary of his herd. Cott.— The Dairy Division, U. S. Department of Agriculture, the Ex - tension and the Dairy Departments of the University of Nebraska furnish assistance in organizing and also furnish certain material and apparatus necessary for carrying on the work The salary of the supervisor must be provided for by the association. The cost should not exceed $1.50 per cow per year. This amount will be sufficient in most communities to meet the entire expense of the association. The supervisor works under the direction of the College of Agriculture and must be familiar with the work before he is permitted to take charge of an association. Value of Record*. — Ths cow .testing association records often prce a revelation to the owners of herds. For example, No. 1 shows a cow that produced last year only 111.9 pounds of fat and was kept at a loss of $11.28. A few such cows kept in the herd will very rapidly cut down the profit made by the remainder of the herd. Such cows too frequently escape the notice of the owner if they are not occasionally brought to account. It is a common thing to hear a member of an association say, "Some of my cows that I had always considered very good producers proved to be the poorest cows in my herd." On the other hand, cows that have been considered rather low pro - ducers sometimes prove to be the most profitable cows in the herd. No. 2 shows the cow, Maud, a Jersey-Shorthorn, owned by F. E. Put- man, of Gage county. Mr. Putman has offered her for sale a number of times at $50 because he thought she was unprofitable. At the end of the association year. May 31, 1916, Maud had produced 85 pounds of fat more than any other cow in Mr. Putmans herd and 52 pounds more than any other cow in the association. Mr. Putman say now, "She is not for sale, but she is worth $125 to me." Cow testing association records, then, not only assist in weeding out unprofitable cows, but also increase the value of good cows since they indicate exactly what &lt;«ach cow is capable of dolnjc. </seg>
            <seg id="p370">370 PaUCKEUfSOS .NfcBKAbKA SIAll WMKD Ut A(,KU I 1.1 1 KK Unquestionably the largest factor in profitable dairying is the kind of cows that are kept and the only sure way of determining what a cow is doing is to weigh and test the milk and keep a record of the feed con - sumed. The cow testing association makes such records possible and practicable. THE SELF-FEEDER SYSTEM FOR RAPID GAINS AND FEED ECONOMY. By ('has. B. Lee, Department of Animal Husbandry. Nebrask Agricultural College. Sometime, somewhere, somebody started the idea that whatever a a man likes he should not have. Whether the somebody was a man with a perpetual grouch or a dyspeptic or one of these "always taking the joy out of life" persons, it is hard to say. Perhaps the idea was born in the martyr age when people, to show their own unworthiness. underwent bodily tortures, thus demonstrating to their own satisfaction by a tor - ment of the flesh the stableness of the spirit. At any rate, selT-denial has been handed down to us as one of the cardinal virtues. As children, we all soon learned that most of the food we liked best was food which we must eat of sparingly and the ever-present bugaboo of medicine represented in childish minds by bitterness and castor oil, served as a check on too eager appetites. With such remembrances in our minds there is little wonder that many of us looked suspiciously at those daring persons who, in late years, have been spreading the heresy of letting the appetite determine the kinds and amounts of foods to be eaten. And while, in many cases, we have been won over to the new belief in so far as it has to do with our persons, many are still of the opinion that the needs of farm animals can most wisely be administered to without consulting the desires of the animals themselves. Consequently, the much advertised self-feeder system for feeding pigs is of especial interest in that it has. seemingly, in a great many cases, proven that the pig is not only capable of selecting the kind of food that will do him the most good, but is also able to determine the amount of food material necessary for most economical gains. Many men have been practicing for years a self-feeding system by turn - ing their hogs in the corn field. Under such a system some protein feed, such as rape or alfalfa forage or tankage has been provided to balance the ration. There are few men who have tried hogging down corn who do not recommend it. In fact, this system has proven one of the moot efficient systems for economic pork production. Self-feeding corn from a box differs from wir-feeding com from the stalk standing in the field only In that the hogs are not required to roam </seg>
            <seg id="p371">371 KKA»KA MTATfc IHlAKIt Of AliKlcl'l H lit. r iver considerable ground in order to get their feed. Obviously, on account if more ease of access and consequently less exercise the box system of self - feeding would encourage the more rapid gains than the hogging down method. Such has proven to be the case, and the numerous feeding tests •arried on in different states located in the corn belt region unanimously iemonstrate the efficiency of the box self-feeder for producing rapid, ■oonomieal gains. The Iowa experiment station found that self-fed hogs produced four- teen per cent faster gains and consumed less feed than hand fed hogs. After many experiments with different systems of feeding hogs, the Iowa ■xperiment station unreservedly recommends the self-feeder when the object is to secure rapid gains. Likewise in the feeding tests carried on at the Minnesota experiment station, the self-feeder method has been found nf great advantage in preparing hogs for the market. In an experiment just completed at the Nebraska experiment station 'ourteen head of spring pigs fed by the self-feeder system put on an aver - age daily gain for six weeks of 2.02 pounds per pig. The pigs were fed shelled corn and tankage, the corn and tankage being fed through sepa - rate self-feeders. When the test began the average weight of the pigs was 167 pounds nd when it closed they averaged 252 pounds. In making their gains, the pigs consumed 64 V4 bushels of corn and 300 pounds of tankage. Charging the corn at 63 cents per bushel, the price paid for it during the time the feeding test was in progress, and pricing the tankage at $2.50 per hundred weight, the total cost of feed eaten amounted to $448.14. For this cost 1,191 pounds of gain were made, making the gains cost $4.04 for 100 pounds. Computing the gains made on the pigs as worth 6 cents per pound, price of 99 cents per bushel was received for the corn fed. It is interesting to note that the pigs ate an average of 6.14 pounds corn and .51 pound tankage a day. This shows that they consumed the corn and tankage in the proportion of twelve parts corn to one part tankage. According to generally accepted figures for the digestibility of corn and high grade tankage, this gives a nutritive ratio of about 1 to 6.5. This indicates that the old hand-feeding method, in which it was assumed that one part of protein to every six or seven parts of carbohydrates was about correct for economical gains was directly in line with the desires of the pigs' appetites. It will likewise be seen that in the amount of grain eaten there was not a much larger consumption than there is under many systems of heavy feeding by hand. Consequently, until more definite knowledge is gained, it might bo assumed that the principle advantage of the self-feeder method is gained by allowing the pigs to get food when- ever their appetites crave it. This accomplishes economy by not over - loading the digestive system at any one time, hence allowing it to carry on its work more efficiently. Since the self-feeder system necessarily is a help yourself system, it obviously would not be suited for mature members of a breeding herd of </seg>
            <seg id="p372">372 PBOCEBOiyGb STATE ROABU OF AGBICULTI'KE swine unless food was provided that would not cause the animals to become over fat. It is possible that such food might assume the form of ground alfalfa hay or bran mixed with a small amount of grain. The bran or the ground alfalfa, would provide bulk and so prevent the animals getting an over supply of fattening food. While the general adoption of the self-feeder for breeding animals has not been fully demonstrated, work under way would indicate that it may be so adopted providing some such precaution is taken in administering the feed materials as indicated above CO-OPERATIVE LIVE STOCK MARKETING. By H. 0. Filley, Department of Farm Management, University of Nebraska "I'll give you $125 for the steers, $80 for the heifers and $35 for the old cow, $240 for the bunch. The cow may lose me money at that price but 111 take her if you sell me the young stock." "But those heifers must weigh at least 800 pounds apiece, and that would be only 5 cents a pound." "They will weigh very little over 700, so I'm offering you 6 cents per pound. Grass fed stock do not weigh down as if they had been corn fed. You will never get a better offer." "Why not weigh them up and s&gt; take 6 cents." how heavy they are? I'm willing to "I have never bothered to weigh the cattle which I purchased," answered the stock buyer "Tell you what I'll do, though. I will make it $250 for the bunch, and give you a check now for the $50 to bind the bargain. We will come out for them Saturday morning and I will pay the balance then. You are selling at a good price, know just what you are getting, and will not even have to deliver them. I take all the risk. What do you say? The stock buyer drew out a check book and an indelible pencil and waited for the farmer to reply. "They are rushing lots of grass fed stuff to market now," he continued, "and the price may tumble any day. Better sell before they go down." "All right, come out and get them. It seems as if they ought to bring more, but we are too busy just now to bother with them and the feed is getting short." The stock buyer visited other farms and made similar bargains. Ac - customed to buying and selling, he was a good judge of stock and their value, and incidentally of human nature. Few of the men with whom he dealt had scales, and fewer yet had a very accurate idea of the price which their cattle would bring on the terminal market. There is too great a </seg>
            <seg id="p373">373 mver.fXNoR NtBBASKA STATK BOAKH OK \f.RlrlT,TI KK rangV in pri&lt;»- quotations, because of the difference in the grade of cattle. The buyer, therefore, "lumped off" the animals whenever posdible. Tinder such conditions all the advantage is with the buyer. Hog prices run more uniform, because the bulk of bogs offered for sale is of more uniform grade, and country buyers are, therefore, com - pelled to offer a definite price per pound. Because of the competition among buyers we usually find a fair mar - ket for all kinds of stock in nearly all towns. Even when there is only a single buyer, the potential competition of buyers in other towns and the knowledge that they will buy stock wherever they can be purchased at a bargain, tends to keep prices at a fair level. In many towns we find several buyers and often very active competition between them. Sometimes the competition results either in a price war which lasts until one of the buyers is forced out of business, or a "gentleman's agreement," which divides the business. Such a locality is in need of a co-operative shipping association. The buyer who visits all the farmers within his territory, and keeps track of their stock may be a very busy man, and work hard for his net income. The vital question is not, how hard does he work, but is his work necessary? It makes little difference either to the feeder or to the packer who ships the stock which he purchases at a terminal market. He is inter - ested in the stock, and the price which he must pay. It naturally fol - lows that the regular buyer and shipper does not get a better price than does the man who ships but seldom. If he does not get a better price for the stock sold, how does he make a living? The only logical answer is that he must pay a lower price than the producer would receive if he sold direct. All his time spent in looking for marketable stock must be paid for by the men who sell the stock. The co-operative shipping association is an organization to take the place of the country buyer. The members believe that they can market stock cheaper themselves than through a buyer. They believe that they know when their stock is ready to market, and that it is a needless expense for competitive buyers to drive out to look the stock over. The capital required by such a company is very small, and ths plan of organization very simple. A manager is elected who does the major portion of the work for the association. Often a certain day of the week is agreed upon as a regular shipping day. The members who have stock to ship notify the manager. He orders cars and attends to the details of shipping. It is often necessary, and in fact usual, to ship in one car stock be - longing to several men. One of the simplest methods of marking the stock is to clip the hair upon some part of the body with a pair of shears. For example, A's stock may be marked on the right side of the neck. </seg>

The stock of each shipper is sold separately, and the manager turns the proceeds over to him, less the necessary shipping and selling expense and a small fee which pays the running expenses of the association. Each man receives what his stock is worth on the open market, no more and no less. As the shippers do not receive their pay for stock until after the net returns have been remitted to the co-operative company from the terminal market, only a small capital is required. Each farmer finances his own shipment; that is, he receives his net returns a few days later than if he had sold to a local buyer. The Farmers' Business association of Arapahoe, Nebraska, is unique in its organization, in that no shares of stock are issued. Bach member pays an entrance fee of $1.00, and $1.00 for every carload weighed over the association scales. These two items furnish sufficient money to keep the yards, sheds, office and water supply in fine condition. Each shipper pays his proportionate share of the freight and selling expense upon a car of stock and a small per cent to the local manager of the association The secretary of the association wrote me a year or two ago: "W« are credited with having one of the finest yards between Hastings and Denver. Our association has driven all competition from town, a sure sign that our system works well. Farmers pass their own town to ship through us." During the year preceding March 1, 1913, they shipped out 10 stock valued at nearly $132,000. The expense of operating the association was $51.75. This does not include the small fee paid the manager by each shipper. Practically all the shipping associations from which I have heard giv&lt; favorable reports and continue their work from year to year. They eai perform the service of selling live stock cheaper than will any individua who is working for personal profit. In other words, the owner receive! 100 per cent of his profit on feeding stock. What about the country buyer who loses his livelihood because co-operative association? Will there be less of prosperity in the munity because his work has proven needless? The greatest factor in human progress is the elimination of labor Man is rendered more efficient by machinery, his powers enlarged by reducing the waste of energy, and added returns for labor performed allow him more of the comforts of life. Three thousand years ago six per cent of all human labor in the most civilized country in Europe was engaged in grinding flour for bread, after the wheat had been planted, cultivated and threshed by wearisome hand methods. Today the grinding of flour employs a very small fraction of one per cent of our labor. What are the men doing whom modern machinery has displaced? They are engaged in manufacturing bath tubs and books, electrical fix </seg>

The men who receive the added price for their stock have more money to spend for things which add to the joy of living. Let the dis - placed stock buyer help supply these wants. No nation or community prospers because it has many men who are performing unnecessary work; some communities prosper in spite of such a handicap. The farmers' shipping association is easily organized. The most that is required is stock to ship and a little confidence in one's neighbors. The results are increased confidence and increased profits. We usually like our neighbor when we know him. A farmers' co-operative elevator may often add the shipping of live stock in its other work. It requires but little capital and only a small portion of the manager's time. If the manager says he is too busy, let him hire some assistance in his routine work. Where practically all members of the elevator company sell live stock it is better to use the established organization than to start a new one. In the past the term "business man" has seldom been used to include the farmer. It has bean considered the function of the farmer to pro - duce, while the business man should distribute the product. This con - dition will continue so long as each farmer markets independently of every other farmer. Co-operation permits the producers of any community to become the business men of that community, by uniting in the sale and purchase of goods. In many Nebraska communities every man who grows live stock knows that he receives just as good a price for stock as any of his neighbors. He lias simplified the question of profit-making by eliminating the man be - tween him and the packer. At the same time he is gaining confidence in his neighbors, because we all are selling together instead of in compe - tition with one another. The live stock shipping association is worth while, not only because it brings larger profits at the present time, but I.ecause it helps pave the way for rural credit associations and kindred operative organizations UNPREPAREDNESS IN LIVE STOCK INDUSTRY. Hy Kdward L Hurke, Omaha, an Address Before the Nebraska Live Stock Feeders' Association. For several years past, it has gradually been borne in on producers of meat animals, that all is not well with the industry. That thare are at work at all the principal live stock markets in this country, certain forces which deprive the producer of his fair share of the returns, that there is a concentration of control at these markets into the hands of a </seg>
            <seg id="p376">376 l-WH'KEUIMiH .NKBKANKA M.Uf BOAKll Oh Ai.KIl I 1.1 1 HK lew very rich and powerful buying concerns, whose selfish and unfair methods bid fair to first ruin the producers and later re-act with crushing force on the buyers themselves in the shape of diminished production. It isn't necessary for me to go into the details of the enormous losses of &lt; attle feeders during the past two or three years. Coincident with their great losses, the great packing institutions have been absorbing a larger and larger proportion of the business and have been piling up the greatest net earnings in the history of their business. From bitter experience, you are too well aware of the existing conditions. The American National Live Stock association, largely composed as you know, of producers in the west and southwest, has appreciated the unfairness of the present situation and the disastrous results to the entire industry, unless some steps ar ■ taken to find and apply a remedy before it is too late. There must be some line of justice and fairness estab ished between the producers and the few men who buy thsir product. The association believed that the simplest and best way to establish that line was to get all parties in interest together. They therefore asked Mr David F Houston, secretary of agriculture, to call a meeting, inviting all the various interests connected with the live stock industry, especially the producers and th? big packers to attend. It was intended to hold a friendly conference in the hope that by a free and frank discussion of the unfair and unsatisfactory conditions, at least a more iriendly feeling and a better understanding might result and quite possibly, a remedy be dis - covered. At least an improvement in conditions might have been expected. Mr. Houston, whose department seems to be thoroughly alive to the situa - tion and greatly interested in securing a betterment of conditions, promptly complied with the association's request and called a meeting at Chicago on November 15 and 16. 1915. at which Mr Charles J-. Brand, chief of the office of markets, presided. All of the various interests responded to th • secretary's invitation, except the big packers, who practical 1 }- refused to have anything to do with the meeting. It looked to many of us as though they were serving notice of their utter indifference to the welfare of the other branches of the industry. It was a bitter disappointme.it to the producers and we all thought most discourteous to the secretary of agri culture and Mr. Brand, who presided over the meeting with great tact and fairness. We have the richest and the best country in the world, and our people are the most prosperous, and probably on the whole, the happiest in the world. It was turned over to us as trustees by our fathers, a.id we in turn must turn it over to our sons, and if. through any lack &lt; ■; effort or self-sacrifice on or part, it is not as good a place in which to live as when we received it, 1 hold tint we have failed in our duty, and betrayed our trust. That it is the best place in the world to live, is largely due to our form of government, and the principles on which the nation is founded One of the essentials to our continued prosperity is that every man shal&lt; have an equal opportuntiy in life, that no man or set of men shall step in </seg>

If that can t&gt; • done in this country and no way found to remedy it, then t say that before long, it will cease to be that id al plac.e in which to rear our children, which it has been in the past, and which it is our duty to make it in the future. This country is still in its infancy, democracy is on trial. It remains to be seen whether it is going to work out so as to secure the greatest good for the greatest number. That will depend very largely on whether, under our system of government, the greed and rapacity of a few men can control the prices of meat animals for their own benefit. It will depend on the willingness and capacity of such men as we are to make the necessary sacrifices. During the early life of our country, when life was comparatively simple, and business small and evenly distributed, supply and demand and cost of production regulated prices fairly well, but during that time competition was in full swing. As the country has grown older and business more complicated, with the large corporations doing the bulk of the big business, the community of interest idea has stepped in. and gradually competition has been elimin - ated in certain lines so that prices are no longer subject to natural laws That is just what has happened in the greatest industry in our country, and that is the principal thing about which I want to talk with you, in the hope that you will awake to the situation and give the matter the careful study which will be necessary for its proper solution. I refer to the control of the prices of meat animals and meat products by the leading packing concerns. I take it for granted that it is unnecessary for me to go into any great detail as to how this control has been acquired during the past thirty years, and what a death grip a few men have on the prin i ipal live stock markets at the present time, with the resultant loss and suffering on the part of ths producers. Suffice it to say that these men have gradually been perfecting this organization and getting so firmly in - trenched through acquiring control, not only of the meat business proper but of most of the industries connected with it, that now it is a question of whether they are so powerful financially and politically that it will be impossible to break their hold. Put in its simplest form, shall four or live very small groups of men, with unlimited financial power, control the .meat supply of one hundred million people, exploiting the producer on the one hand and the consumer on the other? On the face of it. it doesn't seem possible that they can. for long, succeed, but as one studies the situation the more complicated and difficult of solution does it appear. The present deplorable conditions are due largely to the Laissez fain - system which has prevailed in this country, the idea that by allowing things to take their own course they will in the long run, work out satis - factorily. This is a case where' they haven't worked out that way, and it seems to me that our government has been wickedly negligent in allow - ing the meat business to reach its present status. The first step toward something better is to recognize the situation. There would seem to be several ways open toward at least bettering present conditions. First, trying to force competition between the buyers. Second, government </seg>
            <seg id="p378">378 I-K'M Ktlll.M.- NKllilA.SKA .SI. UK UUAkU Of AliKIl DU'UW. supervision, or even regulation. The latter would probably ultimately lead clear to the regulation of prices. Third, actions for damages against the packers for losses sustained by the seller, involving the proving of the breaking of the anti-trust laws. Fourth, establishment of competitive plants, either privately or municipally owned. Fifth, co-operative mar - keting, which has been so successful in various other lines. Sixth, a thorough investigation of the packing business, and all subsidiaries. Seventh, curtailment in production. Taking them in the above order, the securing of competition by legislative enactment enfored by litigation would be an exceedingly dif - ficult thing. The government has been attempting it for many years. and the result is the condition we now face. It seems to be almost impossible to force three or four concerns to compete, when they fully realize that their community interest lies in not competing. Without any actual agreement, but by tacit understanding, they can accomplish the desired result. Still, by a more rigid enforcement of the law, a thorough airing of the unfair methods practiced in buying, something might h ■ accomplished along this line. Next is government regulation, which it seems to me should be a last resort, and which the majority of our people do not approve. If other ways fail, we may eventually have to omm M this, but government paternalism is not likely to be popular. If other methods fail, I can see no reason why an industrial commission, similar in its functions to the interstate commerce commission, should not be able to handle such a situation as we are now facing in the meat business to the benefit of both the producer and the public at large Next is action for damages by the seller. It is one thing to be sure that the law has been liruki n. and quite a different thing to prove it. Tin- methods employed to break the law an so Intangible that it is well nigh impossible to make proof. Still, in some caueo it might be accomplished, and three times the amount of damage, sustained could be recovered. Fourth, the establishment of competitive plants at the central markets where they would be of most advantag &gt;. is becoming more difficult each year partly on account of the control by the packers of most of the public stock yards. It is attended with great risk, involves tremendous capital and the certainty of a long and bitter fight with those now in control. Considering the tremendous difficulties in organizing the widely scattered producers for a movement of this l:ind, I should say that producers' co-operative plants would not be prac - ticable and that outside competition must come, if at all. by making it possible for individual independents to operate without danger of anni - hilation by unfair methods. Next, the affective co-operative marketing of live stock involves many serious difficulties, such as do not exist in other products. Sixth, government investigation in the past has not been very satisfactory. The beef industry, as you will remember, was investi - gated in 1906 very thoroughly by Mr. Garfleld, then commissioner of corporations, and he was unable to find that the packers were making </seg>

I have always been of the opinion that he did not get to the bottom of the matter, and that the big profits were covered up, either in the subsidiary companies, which ramify interminably, or in the appropriation of large amounts by the heads of the concerns under the guise of administration expenses. Since 1905 the luation has vastly changed. The big concerns have all more than doubled the volume of their business, the proportion of the total meat business of the country handled by them has greatly increased, competition has been still further elimin - ated, and the control over prices made much more complete. The profits also have increased correspondingly . The death knell of competition was sounded when the packers were allowed to acquire the various plants, which went to make up the National Packing company, early in 1903. It seems almost incredible that our department of justice should have stood quietly by without raising a finger, while this was going on. Up to that time, there had been a little real competition In the business. Although this company was later declared illegal and dissolved by governmental action, the constituent plants were all distributed between Armour, Swift and Morris, just a transfer from one pocket to another . The real damage had been done when the plants were acquired. To have restored compe - tition, the packers should have been forced by the government to dispose f the National Packing company's plants to entirely independent Interests. I have mentioned curtailment of production last, because I would consider it an unfortunate solution of the difficulty. At the same time it is undoubtedly the surest method the producer can take to protect his inter - ests, and until conditions change, I have no hesitancy in recommending that producers freely apply it. In a way, it seems unpatriotic to advise producers to curtail production in the necessities of life, when there are hundreds of thousands of people who actually need, but are unable to buy meat, on account of the high prices. But this seems to be the only way over which the producer himself has complete control and is much the simplest and surest one to secure the desired results. By applying this method and letting the reasons be widely known, is a sure way of enlist - ing public opinion on the producers' side and bringing the packing interest to a more reasonable attitude. I am not prepared to say along just what other lines we ought to proceed, but I know one thing, and that is that this is primarily a pro - ducer's problem and unless they take hold .of it with courage and deter - mination and give it careful study, so that they can eventually lead the way toward a proper solution, it is not likely to be satisfactorily solved. It is oni&lt; through the effective co-operation of the producers with govern - ment officials that we can hope for the best results. Government officials aided by the best legal talent that the producers can employ, co-operat - ing with a few representatives of the producers, who are in close touch with the situation and prepared to give their time to the subject, are likely to get results. Certainly such a combination would lead to an </seg>

Present conditions are ample proof that neither the government offi - cials or anybody else are going to protect the producers of beef, pork and mutton. If they are too lazy or too timid or too indifferent to pro - tect themselves, they can expect and will deserve the same sort of treat - ment they have been getting the past three years. As a matter of fact, the producers have stood around for years with their eyes shut and their mouths open, waiting for the plums to drop in, but instead of plums they are now getting very sour lemons. In the past a great deal of time and attention has been given by producers' organizations to railroad questions and questions of production, ignoring the much more difficult and equally important question of marketing and distribution. The day of reckoning has come and it has found us unprepared. While we have slept at our posts the other fellow has for years been busy and now occupies all the strategic positions. It is Infinitely harder now to right matters than it would have been fifteen years ago; and ii things are allowed to drift for another five or ten years it will be just that much harder to right them than it is now. The whole situation. I believe, is fraught with the greatest danger and delay is fatal. We are now paying and will have for years to pay the price of being unprepared, just as some of the countries of Europe are now paying. You can be sure of one thing, that the buying interests are not going to give up their control of the industry without a struggle They have been playing for big stakes and so far have been able to deal all the cards. Another thing equally certain is that you are not going to be able to unload your troubles onto the government by simply demanding investigations and then waiting for them to do all the work. These investigations have a way of never getting anywhere unless the people who are interested follow up with substantial assistance. The sooner the issue is joined the better for the country- Every man in the industry should make up his mind where he is going to stand and how much he is pre - pared to sacrifice. In this matter the average feeder seems to be a fatalist. He acts as '.hough he thought the present system God-made instead of the work of man. It is much easier to acquiesce than to fight . An association like yours, located in the very heart of the beef producing country, ought to take a leading part in finding a remedy. Of course, co-operation with other live stock associations is essential. The American National Live Stock association, which will have a meeting at El Paso, Texas, has been doing all it could to help in this matter through the combined efforts of their president, Mr. Dwight B. Heard, their secretary. Mr. W. T. Tomlln - son, and a special marketing committee, of which Mr. A. E. de Ricqles, of Denver, Colorado, is the chairman. Owing to the large membership and character of this association, it is peculiarly well qualified to help the feeders of the middle west solve this problem. To be sure, some of its </seg>

But your problem of today will be - come theirs of tomorrow. As Mr. de Ricqles has so forcibly put it, "when the price of steel rails is low, pig iron is going to be cheap." Undeniably the producers of the west are coming to a better under - standing of the marketing problem and they fully realize that their inter - ests are identical with yours in solving it. You, on the other hand, should realize that only through a general getting together of all the producing interests, can a solution be reached. The American National are willing to take the lead in the matter, but they must have your support. 1 hope that vour association will realize the necessity of becoming a contributing member of the American National and give them all possible support. Wide publicity of conditions ar° necessary at the present time in order to enlist public opinion, and I cannot too strongly recommend, that before you adjourn, you pass resolutions such as I have suggested to your sec - retary, as we need not only the support of the public, but all the help we can get from Washington. HOME CURED MEAT Every Farm Should Have an Annual Butchering Day. Oak Davis says: "There are few men over forty years of age who were raised on the farm who do not count among the rarest of their boy - hood experiences the annual butchering day when enough hogs were killed to supply the family meat larder for the coming twelve months, nor is the happy memory of home-made sausage something soon to be forgotten. And then there was that institution known as the family pork barrel where the meat that was to be preserved was pickled. Here was the first destination of the hams and bacon before they were transferred to the leaky smoke house to complete the purgatory pre - pared for all good hams and bacon. And the smoke house itself — that was also an institution. Usually it stood at some distance apart from the rest of the buildings so that in case it caught fire, as it sometimes did. It would not endanger anything else. In the summer time and for most of the rest of the year it furnished a handy store house for garden tools and other light objects which had more or less of a transitory nature. However, it still remained the smoke house and it kept its identity intact by maintaining a most delicious smoky odor that never failed to create a watery mouth for any hungry individual who chanced to invade Its precincts. Once a year and sometimes more often it came Into its own, and on these occasions gorged itself with appetizing smoke from hickory wood </seg>

While thus fulfilling its destiny there was no place on the farm that received more attention or that was priaed more highly, for out of it as everyone knew, would soon come the fresh smoked meat, and there 1b something about home cured and smoked meat that endears itself in our memories. Consequently, the passing of the farm smoke house and the old pork barrel in the cellar are matters of deep regret to those who remember them as family institutions. Furthermore, there is a decidedly practical side to the preparing of meat on the farm which in itself is sufficient to arouse new interest in this old fashioned practice. In this way meat can be supplied to the farmer's table at a considerably lower cost than if it were bought on the market. However, owing to the use of improper methods or carelessness, many people have spoiled their meat in trying to cure It, and spoiled meat is very discouraging to any one who in this way suffers a con - siderable financial loss. Perhaps it is largely because of the spoiling of meat in the pork barrel that many people prefer to buy rather than fur - nish their own. The spoiling of meat can always be traced to delinite causes and these causes can usually be easily avoided. Probably the most common causes for meat spoiling in curing are due to one or more of three things, first, in not getting the animal to bleed well when killed; second, putting the meat in the salt pickle before it is thoroughly cooled; third, tli»- use of a poor grade of salt in making up the brine for pickling. In order to be certain that everything is right, it is well to exercise care in attend - ing to all the details of killing and the subsequent handling of the meat. If this is done the result will be a supply of excellent meat at a minimum cost. In the selection of hogs for killing, the light weights running from 200 to 250 pounds are to be preferred. When hogs of this size are used, there will not be so much fat on the carcass, mucli of which if it appears on the hams, shoulders and bacon, is undesirable. Furthermore, light hogs are easier to handle than heavier animals and they cut up into much more usable sizes of meat pieces. The pigs should be in a good, thrifty condition when killed. It' they are gaining rapidly in weight so much the better. At least twelve hours before the animals are killed they should be shut in a pen by themselves and deprived of all food. If this is done the dressing of the carcass will be a much simpler operation. Care should be taken that the pigs do not become excited and overheated just before killing. Such a condition pre - vents good bleeding and hence endangers the keeping qualities of the meat. In killing hogs it is absolutely essential that the animals bletd well. It is on this account that experienced men usually resort to stick - ing rather than to killing by any other means. After the carcass has been dressed, it should be allowed to get thor - oughly cooled before it is cut up. It is best, however, not to let the meat </seg>

Freezing ib detrimental in that wueii tin- meat thaws it is more spongy than it was prior to freezing. Meat that is put in the salt pickle after being frozen, on account of its spongy condition, will absorb a large amount of brine and become altogether too salty. In preparing the hams and shoulders for packing, trim off all ragged scraps of meat. These scraps can be made into sausage. On cured hams they are just so much waste. There are two methods of packing meat in common use. One of these is a dry and the other is a wet or brine pack. As a general prac - tice packing brine can be recommended over the dry method. The latter practice demands more work and unless a well prepared place is at hand ir is difficult to sufficiently protect meat curing by the dry process from insects. On this account the following directions are for curing meat by the use of brine. After the meat is ready for curing it should be well rubbed with common table salt. A good practice followed by many men who bare made a success in the curing of meats is to, in addition to rubbing the meat, inject a little concentrated salt solution around the knuckle joints of the hams. In practically every instance where hams spoil in the pickle, the spoiling starts around the bone. This is due to the fact that the salt does not penetrate deeply enough into the meat By injecting brine, however, this difficulty is overcome. Allow the salted meat to drain over night and then pack in a barrel or large jar. Be sure and have the container well scalded before the meat is put in it. If a barrel is used it is a good plan to try to get one that has contained molasses. Such a barrel Is not likely to give an un - desirable flavor to the meat. It is best never to use a barrel that has at any time contained spoiled meat. l'ack the hams and shoulders in the bottom of the barrel and fill in with strips of bacon. After the meat has been packed, a brine solution made up of 10 pounds of salt, 2 pounds of brown sugar, 2 ounces of salt petre dissolved in 4 gallons of pure water should be used for every 100 pounds meat. If there is any question about the purity of the water supply, it is a good plan to boil it before using. Be sure that the meat is well covered with the brine. It is important in making up the brine solution that pure salt is used. It is a good plan to always use the regu lar packer's salt. This salt is free from alum, and other undesirable impurities. If the meat is cured in warm weather it is a good plan to boil the brine before it in used. In the winter, boiling of the brine is generally unnecessary. Watch the brine closely from day to day and if it becomes stringy or syrupy, reboil it or put the meat in fresh brine. The latter practice is perhaps the safest and therefore the best. Leave the strips of bacon in the brine from four to five weeks and the hams and shoulders about seven weeks. After this time they should </seg>
            <seg id="p384">384 nxKEEDIMiS MttKASKA STATE IMIAMK »r AUBI" ILTrBt be removed and hung up in a place free from insects for two or thro. - days to drain. It is a good plan to rinse off the meat with clear water after it is taken from the brine. After draining the meat it is ready to be smoked. This can best be done in a house especially built for the purpose. However, good results have been accomplished by using a large box. The smoke house should be so constructed that good ventilation Is obtained, but there should tx no draft. The Ore should be far enough away so that there is no danger of overheating the meat. The best arrangement is to have the fire out - side in a pit or fire box .with the smoke flue passing into the house at the floor. Hickory wood makes the very best fuel for smoking purposes although corn cobs make a very acceptable substitute. Soft wood of any kind should never be used. If a steady fire is maintained the meat should be sufficiently smoked in three to five days. The color of the meat will indicate when the smoking has been carried far enough. After smoking, the pieces of meat should be allowed to cool, then wrapped in paper (newspapers are very good for this purpose) then put in heavy muslin bags and hung up in a dry place until ready for use. Smoked meat should never be piled up. Some people seal up meat bags by coating them with a starch paste or by a mixture of white wash and a little glue. Such a coating insures the meat from outside con - tamination. For preparing ordinary salt pork, the pieces of meat should be pre - pared for the brine in the same manner as described for the meat to be smoked. The brine for salt pork should consist of 10 pounds of salt and 2 ounces of salt petre to four gallons of water. This solution, it will be noted, is the same as given before except for the omission of the brown sugar. The salt pork is left in the brine solution until it Is used. For the making of sausage on the farm, there is perhaps no recipe which has given more general satisfaction than the New England recipe. This recipe varies to some extent in different places, but in general em - bodies the same ingredients wherever it is used. To 50 pounds of finely chopped meat use three-quarters of a pound of coarse salt, 5 ounces of black pepper, 4 ounces of finely pulverized sage and 5 tablespoons of ginger. These ingredients should be well mixed together and the mixture then thoroughly and uniformly mixed with the chopped meat. Some - times in addition to the materials just given, a little cayenne pepper is used. However, most people do not like the cayenne pepper in that it makes the sausage a little to hot. </seg>
            <seg id="p385">385 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE WO AMD OF A6EK ULTUBJC CORN TYPES AND YIELD. By C. H. Helm, University of Nebraska. Through corn shows, largely, have come the association of many corn characters with yield. Show or "fancy" corn has laid emphasis on num - erous small and insignificant ear characters until they have been accepted as factors determining yield. It now becomes generally accepted that many of the visible ear characters, as shape of ear, straightness of rows, character of tips and butts, have no correlation with yield. Score cards in the past have laid emphasis on many such fancy points and not enough on utility points. Corn shows have had a considerable value in the past if not in in - creasing corn production by selection. They have caused the use of better growing seed, have encouraged better care of seed and have caused better farming methods in general. Show corn now stands for good terminable seed that is adapted to a particular section — and that's about its limit. All ear characters other than those covering adaptation and viability are simply "fancy points" as far as one is able, at present, to mnert with production. Corn Type*, i'robably the most conclusive work at present time along that of types has been carried on at the Ohio station. In testing out long and short ears for yields, the yield after ten years was in favor of the long cars by the narrow margin of eight-tenths of one bushel. After a nine - year test of cylindrical and tapering ears, the latter out-yielded the cylindrical ears by 1.7 bushels per acre. No difference in yields was obtained between ears of bare and filled tips. The same was true in ■ of ears of high and ears of low shelling per cent. Seed taken from butts, the middles, and the tips of ears showed no material difference vield The one and probably the only real important factor in connection with types is that of adaption. The state of Nebraska affords the most variations in rainfall, season length, altitude and soil of any state in the corn belt. For this reason it becomes impracticable to import seed any great distance. Corn grown continuously in the river counties will un - questionably not thrive in the western parts as well as will a good home grown variety. In general for this state the smoother type of kernel with only medium depth is to be desired. In this connection the Nebraska station has found that the smoother type of corn is more desirable than the rougher and deeper grained types. This is probably of more im - portance farther westward in the state. The Ohio station found a differ - ence of about two bushels in favor of the smoother type of kernel. As stated before the factor of germination is one factor in favor of </seg>

Only in extreme years like the one just past is it necessary to give much attention to this point. Under such conditions the only prac - tical way is either the use of old seed or else early field selection and immediate drying. Every Farmer Hi* Own Seedman. With reference to corn there is little or no reason why every man should not supply his own seed each year. The corn plant is very variable and the effect of climatic conditions is always noticeable. This effect is most usually detrimental, especially when seed is imported from the south or east as compared with a well adapted local variety. The following table indicates this effect: Yield of Corn From Acclimated Seed and From Other Regions While this effect would not be nearly so great in a comparatively local section the principle holds good in rather short changes within the state. The fact is where one is growing a corn which uses the entire grow - ing season and which seems well adapted — there is no reason why he. should discard this seed and import seed from other sources. Most farmers can well afford to select their own seed each year from their own fields. In normal years selecting the ears at husking and stor - ing in a dry well ventilated place is all that is necessary to insure good ( Nebrask ka Experiment I Station.) Name and Origin. 3 Yr.

Little results need be expected from selection or breeding methods on In* (arm. It is true that by field selection one is able to shorten or ■ ■ngttien the growing varieties and also to change some of the characters Materially. However, from a standpoint of yield little results will be •'cured from selection. An exception might be made in case of varieties ich do not use the entire growing season. Even then it would probably sier to secure a local variety that already uses the entire season. Soil Fertility and Soil Culture. il fertility is the one big factor under the partial control of man. Uu'h determine the yield of crops. More profitable returns will be se - ured from looking at the fertility and cultural side of corn production lan from seed selection. The Ohio station after twenty years' test, reports &gt;rn yield under continuous cropping as sixteen bushels as compared to .venty-nine bushels in a rotation of corn, wheat and clover. The applica- of manure increased the yields in each case about twenty bushels kt acre. While such responses would not be secured, in general, in this tate the same principle holds good and in time threatens to become icute in this state. However, one must bear in mind that increased yields, md profitable increased yields, may be — and often are — entirely two eparate things. While every one must farm in a manner to make the tost profit to himself, at the same time there are practices which can be &gt;llowed at the same time which will be increasing the security of the itself. For example, every one should follow a rotation of some sort — no one rotation will apply on every farm. The utilization of all barnyard manures, rotted straw piles and the we of alfalfa or sweet clover are practical and economical methods which an well be applied. In sections where the legumes will not thrive — the uestion there is usually above all, the lack of sufficient rainfall. Soil culture has an important place and must be considered in crop production. Seed bed preparation and the keeping down of weeds are the two main factors. They are often, however, over-emphasized. Corn yields, after five years' test at the Ohio station, were 60.7 bushels ground plowed at depth of 7V4 inches, 63.0 bushels where the ground was subsoiled an extra 7% inches and 61.0 bushels where the ground was deep-tilled 15 inches, with the Spalding plow. When considering that it costs about twice as much to deep till as to plow, the extra yield secured from the Spalding leaves a question mark. On some soils tending toward gumbo or tight subsoils the method may prove valuable. In connection with cultivation it was found after a nine-year average that corn cultivated to a depth of only one and one-half inches gave a yield of four bushels over that where the cultivation was to a depth of four inches. In this state where the rainfall is often light during the </seg>

Ground should, without question, be plowed more shallow each time with the idea in mind only to keep down weed growth and to pre - vent the baking and crusting on heavy types of soils. As a matter of fact the average farmer is practicing most of the methods which will afford him the largest profit for his particular kind of fanning. He must manage so that the greatest returns per acre can be secured with the least cost of production per acre coupled with leaving the soil in the best possible condition.

Each class is defined and a number of -i requirements are imposed as conditions precedent to the merchant s of sale. Agricultural seeds are dflini'd by the law as including the red clover, white clover, alsike clover, alfalfa, Kentuct timothy, brome grass, orchard grass, red top, meadow fescue, uat ;rass rye grass, and other grasses and forage plants, flax. rap*-, and c-reals Concentrated commercial feeding stuffs, or the seed produrts an- defined in the law as follows: The term "concentrated commercial feeding-stuffs." as us&gt;*(i article, shall include alfalfa meals and feeds; dried beet refuse: around beef and fish scraps; bean meals: dried blood: brewers' grains, both vet and dry; cerealine feeds; cocoanut meals; corn feeds; corn and oat feeds; corn, oat, and barley feeds; compounds under the nani-- of corn and cob meals; corn bran; clover meal; cottonseed meal and feeds: germ feeds; distillers' grains; gluten meals; gluten feeds; linswd meals: hominy feeds; malt refuse; malt sprouts; meat meals; meat and bone meals; mixed feeds of all kinds; oil meals of all kinds: oat feeds: oat bran; oat flour; oat middlings; oat shorts: pea meals; poultry foods: rice bran; rice meal; rice polish; rye bran; rye middlings; rye shorts; starch feeds and starch factory by-products; tankage and packing house by products; wheat bran; wheat middlings; wheat shorts: and low grad&lt; - wheat flour, and all materials of similar nature used for domestic animals; condimental stock foods; patented proprietary or trad— marked stock or poultry feeds claimed to possess medicinal or nutritiv- proper- </seg>

But It shall not include: hay; straw; whole seeds; unmixed meals made from the entire grains of wheat; rye; barley; oats; corn; buckwheat; and broomcorn; nor wheat flours nor other flours fit for human consumption. The pure seed law begins by imposing a number of restrictions on the wholesale and retail distribution of feeding stuffs. Packages con - taining this kind of stock food must be labeled with specified information about the contents. A copy of the label must be filed with the food, dairy and drug commissioner, and with this copy a sample of the goods in the package accompanied by an affidavit of the seller showing that the sample is fair and corresponds within reasonable limits to the bulk offered for sale. The seller also must pay an inspection fee of 10 cents a ton sold, or instead of this fee a license of $10# a year, payable before July 1. If the seller is at all careful to comply with the law, a large part of his work may be done before any part of his goods are offered for sale. The law is specific in the information required on the label and also n regard to the manner of taking the sample and the use to be made of it after it is taken. The label must show: (1) the number of net pounds of feeding stuffs in the package; (2) the name, brand, or trade- mark under which the article is sold; (3) the name and address of the manufacturer, importer, dealer or agent; (4) the place where the goods are made; (5) the chemical composition of the goods. The sample for analysis, must be taken by an inspector of the food, drug and dairy department. It must be taken either in the presence of the seller or two disinterested witnesses. If the goods are "concen - trated commercial feeding stuffs, the sample must weigh 4 pounds or if "agricultural seeds," the sample must weigh 4 ounces or less. must be taken from a parcel representing not less than 5 per cent of the whole lot Inspected. It must be thoroughly mixed, divided into two parts, and each part enclosed in a glass or metal case. The inspector is required to leave one sample thus preserved with the seller and take the other sample to the department's laboratory for analysis. When the sample, properly taken is analyzed, the results show whether or not the law has been complied with. The results of seed analysis also are im - portant statistical information for the farmer to have. They are published in the periodical bulletins of the department. The pure seed law imposes a number of restrictions on the sale of "agricultural seeds." The purpose of these restrictions is to prevent some adulterations and limit the amount of other adulterations in seeds offered for sale. Accordingly the statute designates four classes of adulterations in seeds: (1) poisonous weeds, (2) non-poisonous weeds, (3) mineral impurities. (4) mixtures. </seg>

Neither does it apply to seed sold bv one farmer to another farmer for seeding unless the agreement is that the seed is sold under the protection of the pure seed law. Seed held in ■t irage for recleaning purposes only, seed marked, "not absolutely clean," i d a mixture of seeds for lawn and pasture purposes, also are excluded im the operation of this act. But it is unlawful to sell these five ex- pted classes of seed, if they contain any amount of the poisonous weeds • more than 2 per cent by weight of the non-poisonous weeds. From excepted classes one can plainly see the intent of the lawmakers a is to protect the farmer against tha possible mistakes and misrepre- i tat ions of wholesaler and retail dealers in seeds. Since the lawfulness or unlawfulness of the sale of seeds was made depend on the purity of the seed sold, it was necessary for the law to a standard of purity. Accordingly, Section 52 of the Revised Statutes Nebraska for 1913, gives a table showing the required percentage of pure •d and Rerminable seed in all the various kinds of seed that mav be x This table is given here in full: Per Cent of Per Cent of Germinabli Name of Seed.

It is the inspec - tor's business to examine suspected seeds offered for sale and to bring a prosecution against the offending seller when there seems to be good reason to bring it. Before or after buying seed, from a wholesale or retail dealer, the farmer can have samples analysed by the inspector. An offender against this law is prosecuted in the ordinary manner pro - vided by the Nebraska code of criminal procedure, and if he is found guilty of violating the law, his fine is $100 and costs. The plain object of the pure seedlaw, as disclosed by its remedial provisions, is to invest the farmer who buys seed and stock foods with certain rights; to impose certain duties and restrictions on the whole - sale and retail sellers of such seeds; and to make it a criminal offense for a dealer to fail to perform the duties. In conclusion it may be said, that at common law, under the bulk sales act, and the blue sky act, the buyer of seeds may have a civil action for damages against the seller for frauds and misrepresentations made during the sale. A SQUARE DEAL FOR THE FARMER'S WIFE No doubt that title sounds sarcastic to the hundreds of farmers whose wives are already getting such a square deal that it bulges at the sides, but these are sadly in the minority, and I am writing of the average woman on the farm; the woman who does all of her own work, bears and rears from two to a dozen babies, raises several hun dred chickens every year, takes care of the milk and butter from any number of cows, and is expected to furnish the family with an un - limited supply of "garden sass" from the first lettuce in the spring to the last pumpkin in the fall. Nearly all of you farmers are saying to yourselves: "Why, that is no more than any farm woman ought to do," but right there is where I take issue with you. If the farm woman could have modern conven - iences for all of her work, these duties would not be so burdensome, but as a matter of fact, she does all of these tasks with an equipment but little better than that used by her grandmother. For instance, in the matter of household conveniences; how many farm women have water handy to the kitchen? It may not be a supply tank, with taps in the kitchen, but a mere reservoir, close to the house, or in it, which is still better, where the busy woman can get a pail of water without bundling up in the winter or roasting her brains in the summer. This one item alone is one of the heaviest burdens that the farm woman has to bear. By Ada Carroll VVortman, Gage County. Nebraska </seg>
            <seg id="p393">393 PBOCEGUINUK NEMA8KA 8TATK BUABO OK AOBICULTUBS The matter of fuel, too, is a bugbear to farm women. I know that it seems wasteful to buy fuel when there are hog pen cobs and those from the barn and the shelter lying unused, but it would pay infinitely better to sell all that are salable, use the rest for kindling, and bny either coal or good wood. Nothing interferes much more with the work of the day than the constant attention that is needed by a cob fire, and the litter consequent thereupon. Coal is much cheaper than wood, and a (rood coal fire will last without attention for an hour at a time, but the wood is more satisfactory by reason of its cleanliness, both inside the range and outside. Better still is a gasoline or coal oil stove, which eeds no attention except to be filled occasionally. Heat can be furnished y a large heating stove, and the time saved in the kitchen utilized for asks And when illness enters the farm home, the farm woman has to ould-r the additional burden without any of the aids that are fur- ished gratis to her sister in the city. There is no nurse, no hygienic are except what she can give, and no bureau of information where she can receive direction and advice. She bears her children with the at - tendance of a physician (sometimes), and one or two neighbor women know but little more than she does. She lies for one or two weeks. pending upon the state of the domestic menage and her own strength, without any care other than that given by a half-trained girl in the kitchen and the occasional helpful visits of the kindly neighbor women; tnd then people wonder why she breaks so soon, and looks so much older than the town woman of the same age. addition to her heavy household duties, she is supposed to attend to the entire work of supplying the family with poultry and eggs. Few - farmers, even of the most up-to-date type, expect to have any care what- ever of the chickens. It is a fine thing for the woman, in one way, for vithout it she would get very little outdoor exercise except in the spring, when she has the garden to make, but any woman can tell you that the care of poultry comes at the identical hour when there are a half dozen other tasks waiting, and something has to be neglected. Usually, it is the health and strength of the farm woman that is neglected. And any man who gives the subject thought ought to see that it is asking too much of the farm woman that she attend to the planting and cultivating of the garden alone. There is no part of the farm that gives better returns for the land and cost involved than the garden, and while it is most beneficial for the farm woman to get out of doors for a part of her work, it should mean that she ought to be relieved of some of the work indoors; if she is not, she is overworking, and a man should no more overwork his wife than he would his fine brood mares. What do you suppose one of those blessed men would say if he was asked to put one of his cows into the harness, and make her do some of the plowing? But she is far better able to do that than the farm woman is able to do many of the tasks that are expected of her. </seg>
            <seg id="p394">394 PBOCEEDINGS .NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRKILTUBE I am not one of those who does not believe in out-of-door work tor women. Instead, I think that women as a class do altogether too much indoor work; but there should be a more equal division of the outdoor and indoor work. If the average farm woman could have the help of her husband or a good stout man for one or two half days of each week, it would mean her emancipation from many of the heaviest of her bur - dens, and incidentally would open the eyes of the farmer to many of her needs. In return, she would gladly help him, and the exchange would be beneflcial to both, from a psychological as well as a physical standpoint. Or a good gasoline engine might be the means of revolu - tionizing the work in the home, so that the farm woman could save her strength and nerve force for better things than mere physical exertion. The farm woman is not given a square deal in the matter of beau - tiful surroundings, either. I grant you that there are many farm homes that are far more beautiful and well-kept than the homes in town, but they are in the small minority, and we are writing now about the aver - age farm woman. Hogs and chickens run about her yard at will; the wood-pile or the cobs lie in her very door-way, "so they will be handy;" there is no grass and flowers to be seen: and paint and varnish an conspicuous by their shabbiness, if not their absence. She loves beauty as well as any one, and it is small wonder if she grows dissatisfied, and longs to move to town, where hogs and hens do not corrupt, nor cattle break through and steal. She has protested until she finally sees that it is of no avail, and she resigns herself to the inevitable, but it is not giving her a square deal. A few dollars expended in fencing, -e.d and shrubbery might mean the difference between a satisfied farm wife and one who was forever rebellious against life in the country, and I am sure that any farmer who will give the subject a moment's thought will agree with me that he could hardly spend ten or fifteen dollars to bet - ter advantage, considering everything that it would mean. The matter of social advantages, too, is one in whit woman comes in for far less than her share. It is amazing, to one who has been accustomed to a reasonable amount of social diversion, to dis - cover the paucity of organized social endeavor in the average farm com - munity. Fortunately, many communities are waking up, and there are hundreds of country clubs now in existence, but the number is all too few, and there are many bipeds in the semblance of men who refuse to let their women folks have anything to do with such "notions." The sociable chat over the back yard fence that is the time-honored privilege of the woman in town is denied to the isolated farm woman, and it is her right to demand and receive social recognition. The busiest farmer goes to town and to the neighbors on errands and gets to see and con - verse with his neighbors, while there are women who never go off the home place for weeks at a time. The farmer who permits such a condi - tion may think that he is making time, but it has been proved by actual experiment that the women who take time to visit, and meet their </seg>

The farmer's wife is not given a square deal in the matter of school - ng. her children. In these days, a child is not half grown before he has Inished the work that is permitted in the country schools; then he must :-ither stop going to school or else go away from home. It is an injus - .ice both to the child and to the mother that it is necessary for him to deprived of her care and counsel at the time when he needs her i much as he does at this transition period. He is not conscious iat he needs her, but she knows it, and she knows, too, that when he ies away from her, he soon ceases to depend upon her. and is usually rmanently estranged from home influence. Even the government is not guiltless in the matter of giving the farm oman a square deal. The woman in the city has inspectors for every - ing that she eats or buys; her children are guarded in school; the )ublic health is looked after most rigorously. If the city woman wants nformation, there is some one always ready to furnish it. The farm •vonian can also procure much valuable information, but it is so hard o get at, and so bound with red tape in many instances, that she had ather go on in the old way than to try for it. I am willing to give all redit and honor to the government for the helpful data it is prepared to supply, but I wish it was in more available form. At present, it ■•■minds me of nothing so much as a man who has provided his wife Aith a liberal wardrobe, but has furnished her with no place to keep r clothes when she is not wearing them. She needs a bureau, where she can put her clothes neatly away when she is not using them, and .vhere they will be readily available when she needs them. And that is iust what the farm woman needs: a government bureau where all the nformation which she needs will be instantly accessible. This is not at ill beyond the confines of reason, and every farm woman can be working such a bureau if she will. I do not want to be considered as thinking that all farm women are :reated unjustly; I am only trying to show you that the average farm .voman is not getting a square deal, and asking what you intend to do tbout it. </seg>
