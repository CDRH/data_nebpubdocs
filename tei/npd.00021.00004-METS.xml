            <seg id="p038">38 THE WORK OF THE FARMERS' INSTITUTE IN HORTICULTURE VAL KEYSER, LINCOLN. The field of horticultural work is so broad, each line requiring a specialist, that the speaker soon finds that the scope of his subject must be limited. He is also forced in his discussion to effect a compromise of the various lines of horticultural work to suit the needs of the people where he is sent. Our State Horticultural Society has emphasized only a few of the various lines of work included under the broad subject of horticulture. The students and investigators in horticultural schools and colleges have found it necessary, in order to present the subjects, to classify the work about as follows: (1) Pomology, or fruit growing, (2) Landscape Gar - dening, (3) Floriculture, (4) Vegetable Gardening, (5) Forestry, which in many states becomes a department by itself, and (6) Plant Breeding may also be included. Improvement of plants can be practiced in all of the lines above mentioned, but if one expects to master the subject it will be found necessary to make a separate course of study, which in - volves the principles and practices of plant improvement in general. Plant breeding has been practiced and carried further by horticulturists than by others who deal with plants. This is perhaps true because hor - ticultural plants lend themselves more easily to the work of the plant Improver. We could go further and make a series of subdivisions under each of the subjects outlined as belonging to the field of horti - culture. But this is sufficient to show the immense amount of work required of one who undertakes to prepare himself for a teacher of general horticulture. Our society with its members representing the many lines of horticultural work has been unable to cover the entire field. Vegetable gardening is rarely ever discussed before our meetings. Little has been done in landscape gardening and forestry, but we find that we have limited our discussion chiefly to fruit growing and flori - culture. It has occurred to the writer that more attention should be paid to the subject of vegetable gardening. Every year at the state fair we find the products of the garden occupying a very conspicuous place in the show of Nebraska products. Tomatoes, celery, melons, and other vine products, which are placed among the fruits for the delicacies of the table, do not find a place on the shelves of our Horticultural Building. Even the potato, which is the people's stand-by and one of Nebraska's surest crops, is dumped in among the field crops; yet if you wish in - struction in the subject of potato culture you are directed to the horti - culturist. All this is introduced to show how much is expected of the man who wishes to become a teacher of horticulture. The institute speaker may choose one plant from any of these various lines, and find abundant material for a subject with which he can interest an audience. </seg>
            <seg id="p039">39 For example, in the line of pomology, we may use the apple or the straw - berry and we find it difficult to cover the subject of the growing and care of either of these fruits in the time allotted an institute speaker. From the line of landscape gardening the speaker may take the evergreens and before he has covered the details of the planting, growing, and pruning of these trees in order to get the greatest benefit and most attractive ar - rangement will have used up his portion of the time. From the line of floriculture he may choose the carnations and devote an hour to the discussion of this flower. The vegetable gardener could use an hour in a lecture on the production of the sweet potato or the canteloupe. The speaker may take one plant from the subject of forestry; suppose he chooses the catalpa. By the time he has discussed the preparation of the ground for planting the seed, the care and culture and use of the timber and answered the questions which he has awakened in the audience, the better part of an hour will have been consumed. It is not necessary to point out how a speaker could utilize an hour in discussing one of the processes of plant breeding. The directors of the Farmers' Institute Department have always al - lowed the speaker a great deal of latitude as to the subject matter of their lectures. A few new subjects have been introduced by the depart - ment, but most of the speakers go out at the request of the local com - munity. Horticulture is prominent among the subjects the department has tried to introduce in our farmers' institutes. It is quite an under - taking to furnish the information the people are asking for. And a still greater problem to introduce ideas where the people are ignorant of the subjects or have become discouraged in trying to grow crops without a proper understanding of the habits of the plant. The farmers' institute lecturer on horticultural subjects will realize this condition among two - thirds the audiences he addresses. We have our Horticultural Society composed mainly of members who are following some special line of work and are devoting the major portion of their energies to their chosen line. It is not unreasonable to suppose that the importance of their work is often greatly magnified, but this seems to follow the specialist in every line and may be an essential to success. The principal phase of horticulture which the institutes have attempted to introduce is horticulture in its relation to the farm home. What is meant by this is that an attempt is made to show the fanner that he need not be without a decorated lawn, a home orchard, and a garden, nor lose the benefit of windbreaks and shelterbelts because he Is busy with field crops and the care of his stock. Little attention has been given to the commercial side of fruit growing, gardening, or forestry, and less has been done with floriculture and plant breeding. Perhaps this is a mistake, and it may be that the people would take more interest In our work if we showed the profits from an acre of hardy catalpa. an acre of strawberries, or an acre of canteloupe. People may not be constituted Just as they should be, but the institute speaker will find that he can </seg>
            <seg id="p040">40 interest his audience at once when he figures the value of a product in dollars and cents. The chief question in the mind of the producer today is, does it pay? This is why a lecturer on the production of pork and corn is always in demand. It is not eo easy to figure out the money side of a vine growing over the door or a flowering shruh in the corner of the lawn, but these things have a value which need not be measured In dollars and cents. And, if our Nebraska farmers do not appreciate a beautiful country home, it is because there has been something lacking in our system of education. The farmer of the past had many difficulties to overcome. This new country had to be domesticated, but the future is brighter and better than the past. Our schools of horticulture will in - terest the young men. The farmers' institutes with their horticultural lecturers are sure to reach the active farmers of today. The department has also begun a work which will afford an excellent opportunity to reach the young minds of the country and start them in the right direction before, they have lecome discouraged l&gt;y failures due to the lack of correct knowledge of how to cultivate and care for this class of plants. This is the work of the Nebraska Boys' and Girls' Contests. As yet corn is the main crop undertaken for contest work, and over 4.000 boys have entered the contest. We have been obliged to exclude a number of counties this year because the corn crop was not a success in some parts of the state. Plans are in progress to have boys in these counties take up work with potatoes. There is no reason why these boys can not work with the strawberry or the growing of seedling trees. In other states of the east a work is started thru the Department of Farmers' Institutes and Experiment Stations known as movable schools of agriculture. Professor Samuel B. Green of the Minnesota Experiment Station has prepared a course of study in fruit growing. This is pub - lished by the I T . S. Department of Agriculture, and Mr. Hamilton is urging Nebraska to take up the work. A great many of our leaders in farmers' institute work thru the country are of the opinion that the people will soon outgrow the stage when a forty-minute lecture on a subject will satisfy their desire for information. The movable school of horticulture will give a course of from six to ten lectures as a substi - tute for the one lecture now given at each institute point. There is no question but that this plan is worthy our careful consideration. P&gt;re concluding this paper, I should like to refer to the demon - l idea introduced by Congressman Pollard, "the spraying demon - l in southeast Nebraska." It seems that these demonstrations &gt;e successfully carried on by using crops from several of the dif - lines of horticulture; i. e.. suppose we wish to convince the people that strawberries, melons or evergreens can be successfully grown in ox Butte county. A competent man could be sent into that locality. Let him choose a farm that would represent average conditions, and have him grow these crops and trees for a period covering two to four years. </seg>
            <seg id="p041">41 This would show the farmer that by the proper rare these crops could be grown successfully. we can not depend on the average farmer to introduce new method Merely to tell him how is not suf - to him that these crops can be made productive in his locality The specialist is always in ad ■ s of the common people and some - (ople to take up with a new idea be beneficial to the community as times it tat a whole.

I was in 'ert, but I took the first train nan I in to Lincoln. I am very the University apprt he « is doing in the state if which inte it- I ner; mis to me that the Horticultural Society especially can ng the people to appreciate more the fruits and flowers an find everything that concerns the ornamentation oim f that this education is necessary in a large part of Nebraska in order ii make the farmers appreciate home decoration — in order that they m now the value of plants, how to grow them, and what plants and flower to select. Now if the farmers work for this better class of homes they will get them. I think perhaps more than anything else these farm homes need the care and enjoyment of plants and flowers. And to produce these plants and flowers the care is the essential thins. I have heard of a farmer, not very far from here, who is probably worth J30.000, and he said he had planted $1,000 worth of trees and plants, and now he has nothing to show for it. These trees of his were planted about fifteen or twenty years ago, when there was not much knowledge of such things. But from the statement of this man he had been very successful in all other lines of farming, which would seem that he should know how to grow trees. No young man should grow up in this country without the knowl - edge of how to grow trees.

It does not appear to me that it requires so very much knowledge at the present time. The average farmer, when con - sidering trees and flowers, thinks he can not afford them because they have no economic value in his eyes, but there is where he is mistaken. They are not merely ornamental, but they really have an economic value as well. I shall not attempt to tell you what we have been doing along horti - cultural lines here at the State Farm. I believe Professor Emerson has agreed to do that. I only want to assure you that we are glad to have you here. We want to show you what we have here at the farm and further your pleasure and interest here in every possible way. We want you to be sure and see the farm before you go away. I understand pro - vision has been made for your lunch here today. Throughout your visit here if we can do anything to make it more enjoyable for you we are very glad to do so. Thank you. The President: On behalf of the' members of the society I wish to extend to Professor Burnett our hearty appreciation of his words of encouragement and cordial welcome. We are glad to be here. We are glad to know that he is pleased to have us here. There is one thing we should be proud of in our horticultural lines of work here in Nebraska, and that is that we are observing harmony. The results of these meet - ings will not only make our relations more harmonious, but will make us more zealous in our efforts toward helping each other. I think that more of our members should visit the State Farm here, and see the great and good work being accomplished here. R Yager: Mr. Chairman, I move that Dean Burnett be made an y life member of our society. Motion seconded by Mr. Brown, unanimously. Professor Burnett: I wish to thank the society very heartily for this expression. I must confess that I have been very negligent in not join - ing the society long ago, but I assure you that I will do whatever I can to help the society along and the interests which it represents. Meeting adjourned to 2 P. M. AFTERNOON SESSION. 2:00 P. M. The President: First on the program this afternoon will be a vocal solo, by Miss Edith Roberts, of Lincoln.

            <seg id="p043">43 The topic assigned me. Grapes and Grape Culture, is one that has been discussed before this society a good many times, and I doubt very much if I can say anything new on the subject, and I doubt very much if there is any considerable number of Nebraska people especially inter - ested in the success of commercial grape growing, although a great part of the state is well adapted for successful grape culture, and espe - cially those counties bordering on the Missouri river. Eis not a difficult matter to grow three tons of grapes to the acre, t 5 cents per pound an acre will bring $300. In order to accomplish however, it would require some skill and business ability, besides it 1 be necessary to select varieties well adapted to the locality. At the present stage of the grape industry in Nebraska, our methods of grape culture are very imperfect, and if we expect to make a financial success we must improve our methods. First, select suitable locations with soil adapted for growing the vine. The work of planting must be thoroughly done, then the success largely depends on the selection of the right varieties and the manner of putting the fruit on the market. It won't do to plant just any old variety with the expectation of realizing $300 per acre. While the Moore's Early Grape is probably the most popular grape among the grape growers of Nebraska, yet it is anything but profitable. Its large size, earliness. handsome appearance and fair quality make it pretty well adapted for a market grape, but owing to its lark of productiveness and perishable nature and rather slow growing on prairie soil, especially on a south or west exposure, makes it almost a failure over a great part of the state, but down in Nemaha county on rich or timber land, it produces fair crops of fruit and the vine makes a satisfactory growth. It does the best on an east or north exposure, with good deep, rich soil. (We have been trying to produce a Moore's Early Grape that would be more productive with better keeping qualities, and we believe we have it.) We would recommend the Moore's Early Grape for general planting and market. We consider this grape a better grape in every way than the Concord grape. After fruiting the Campbell's Early Grape for five years we are con - vinced that it is the best all-around black grape for market or general use that grows on Nebraska soil. It appears to be well adapted to our soil and climate. This wonderful grape was produced by the late George W. Campbell of Delaware, Ohio, from seed of Moore's Early pollenized with the Black Hamburg. Just enough of the Black Hamburg to add size, quality and productiveness, with the health and hardiness of Moore's This grape has many good qualities and very few faults.

This is a fine market grape, there is no danger of glutting the market with this grape. It sells well in the four-basket California flat box. The case we use holds about 16 pounds. We pack all our fancy table grapes in these flat cases. There is just one thing about Campbell's Early that must not be forgotten. It will overbear unless pruned very short. When overbearing the vines will suffer and often die from the effects of overbearing. While I would recommend this grape very high there may be some places in the state where it might be a failure. Grapes are like other fruits in this respect, they must be tested to find out if they are adapted to the locality. Our climatic conditions are very trying on our fruit trees and vines, and while our state is so rich in agricultural pursuits we may hardly look for much investigation along the lines of adaptability of fruits to our climate and soil. There may be varieties not now known far su - perior and much better adapted to our climatic conditions than any variety we now grow. Por a successful market grape I prefer red, a red grape lakes the eye. d a great many people buy fruit that pleases the eye instead of the le. At any rate, red fruit is very popular with the public. I have growing grapes for over twenty-five years and in all that time have found a red grape that was perfectly satisfactory as a market grape. Probably the Brighton Ghai'k stands as near first as any for a table and market grape. It is early, of fine quality, a heavy producer of fine clusters, vine healthy and a strong grower, but will not endure our severe winters without protection. This grape has been very profitable El Iowa Grapk is another good red grape very much like the Brigh - ly ten days later and a much better keeper. Not quite hardy; needs tion during the winter. I The WooimiKF Red is a large fine looking grape, very popular with le people, vine not very healthy, fruit of very poor quality, and drops m vine soon after ripe. The Alice Grape is one of the newer red grapes and comes highly recommended, and it may be the grape we are looking for. We have it in fruit, but it is too soon to tell much about it. We have three very fine red grapes of our own production that may become profitable as market grapes, but would not like to recommend them for general planting at the present time. The Diamond Grape (or Moore's Diamond) is one of the good market grapes where a white grape is wanted. It is a large handsome grape, ripens early, good quality, hardy, healthy and productive. The Dutchess is another white grape I cannot help but recommend. We have grown this grape for twenty years and it has always given us </seg>
            <seg id="p045">45 GRAPES AND GRAPE CULTURE. the best of satisfaction. It produces immense crops of finest quality. As a table grape for winter use it has no superior. About the only fault it has the vine is not hardy enough to endure our severe winters without protection, though protecting the vines is quite a simple problem. It would only cost $12 to lay down and cover with soil one acre of these vines and the product of twelve vine! have heard some of our fruit growers That may be owing to its not being might have happened that we planted wants; at any rate, after twenty years profitable variety. would pay the bill. I believe I condemn this grape as worthless, adapted to all kinds of soil. It this variety on soil suited to its trial we would have to vote it a The Lady Washington is another white grape that should be better known. It is a heavy producer of very large clusters, single clusters often weighing one and one-half pounds, of fine quality, ripens about ten days after the Concord; vine healthy and a good grower; not perfectly hardy, but is well worth a little extra care to get such fine fruit as the Lady Washington. We have selected the foregoing varieties to plant in our commercial vineyard. We would not pretend to say these varieties would be profit - able throughout the state. We plant on hazel brush land, and grapes may do better on such land than they would on the ordinary prairie land. With reasonable care we think these varieties would be safe to plant in the eastern half of the state. I wish to call your attention to the following list of splendid varieties of American grapes that appear to be pretty well adapted to the eastern part of the state: The Mii-ls is an extra fine, large, black grape, equal to the European varieties. This grape is very valuable. The Rogers No. 10 is a fine black grape, hardy and healthy. Hekbkkt is always good. Ammisia is a good early black grape. In red grapes the Goethe, Rogers No. 1, is a very fine table grape and a good seller. We usually get six cents per pound for the Goethe. The Jeffebson is another mighty fine table grape. The late G. W. Campbell, of Ohio, called the Jefferson, The Muscat of America. A heavy Kucer of extra large clusters. I presume the only reason it is not :ed more extensively the vine is a little tender. The Ulsteb Pbo - is another red grape we like pretty well. In white grapes Ejcpire State, Green Mountain, Niagara and Geneva are pretty good white grapes. We do not intend to grow many white grapes for the market so we make no special effort to multiply white varieties. On our trial grounds we grow a great many varieties of grapes. We now have about 150 varieties and are constantly adding more. This experimenting is for the sole purpose of discovering, if possible, varieties t&gt;etter adapted to our climate and soil. E'e also grow a great many seedling grapes each year and believe we produced some most excellent varieties. Such varieties as our ,iTY Utility, Comfort, Dewey, Niota, end Yukattub, we think are hy of dissemination. </seg>
            <seg id="p046">46 Lin this paper we have aimed to say nothing that would mislead or eive the intending grape grower. We are deeply interested in grape culture and we hope the people of Nebraska will become interested; if what we have said will cause more vines to be planted, then we have accomplished all we could expect. DISCUSSION Mr. Camp: Don't you recommend the Concord? What is equal to Mr. Alexander: We do not grow the Concord for market, and for several reasons. They don't thrive with us and they do not ripen perfectly. There is no doubt with us but that the Campbell's Early is worth more than the Concord. The vines are cheap and very reason - able. We grow the McPike also, and there is not much difference be - tween it and the Concord. Mr. Beltzer: I haven't much sense about grapes, but I would like to have more grape sense. Now I think Mr. Alexander has left out one of Nebraska's best grapes when he leaves out of his list one of the varieties I have in mind. I was distributing this grape among the ladies out at the State Fair, and it gave the best of satisfaction. And that was no other grape than the Pocklington. I think it is certainly a good grape. I like the good old Concord, too, and I don't believe it is right for Brother Alexander to exclude the Concord from his list. That Pockling - ton grape is one of the best table grapes I ever saw. It is not so very prolific, but it is certainly a good one and worthy of mention. A Member: You mention Campbell's Early Grape. At Fails City where I live it is worthless. How is it over the state? LMr. Alexander: It seems to give general satisfaction. That grape i Introduced about twelve years ago in Nebraska, and today the vines are higher priced than they were when it was introduced. I wrote to the originator of this grape and asked him why the price of the vines was going up, and he said because the demand was constantly growing, and they did not have the vines to supply it. It is perfectly healthy, productive, and the quality is fine. The Campbell's Early in my mind is certainly one of the finest market grapes that grows. It always sells at the highest prices. kMr. Christy: For the general planter is not the Concord about as good any? IMr. Alexander: It is for the farmer who wants fruit for the home, muse it is very hardy and healthy and will bear lots of neglect But you are going to base your grape upon that standard, why not plant i Elvira or something like that that is worthless? Mr. Camp: Is the Moore's Diamond hardy with you? IMr. Alexander: Perfectly so. It is hardy and healthy, and produces d heavy Tines. ▲ Member: It winter-kills with us at Falls City. </seg>
            <seg id="p047">47 Kr. Alexander: I should think it would do well with you there, be - i your soil is the same as ours. But it is merely a matter of adapta - tion. We do not study this question of adaptation enough. We must ■tudy adaptability or we will fail. Mr. Camp: Do you consider the Moore's Diamond hardier than the Niagara? Mr. Alexander: Yes, much more so. Mr. Brown: As to Mr. Alexander's idea of the inferior quality of the Concord grape. I was recently in the lake region of western New York where the growing of grapes is their business. In all that section of grape growing I don't think there is ten acres of anything else except Concord. As to the adaptability of the vine. We sell lots of grapevines such as the Pocklington, Moore's Early, etc., but more of the Concord than anything else. The Concord vine is adapted to every locality in Mr. Alexander; I do not intend to dispute what Mr. Brown says in regard to the Concord. But in our experience of about twenty-five yean of grape growing in Nebraska we find that we can sell other varieties and get from two to three cents a pound more than the Concord brings. That is one of the reasons why I speak- of other varieties in preference to the Concord. But I will not dispute the fact that the Concord is pretty well adapted to Nebraska. rlr. Keyser: Last summer I was doing some spraying work at Auburn, Ir. John Swan's farm. He is growing fruit there and he certainly some of the finest things that I have ever seen. He has some good grapes there, and they are something that are worthy of getting out over the state. He has many varieties that are far superior to the Concord grapes which we are growing in this section of the country. Mr. Brown: I just want to add one word more. I do not want to dis - courage anything that Mr. Alexander is doing, or question the fact that some of his grapes may be superior to the Concord, but I do want to say that the Concord will not be discarded. The President: If there is no further discussion on Mr. Alexander's paper, we will pass on to the next subject on our program, and that is "Ornamentals," by C. E. Dwyer, of Nebraska City. ORNAMENTALS. C. E. DWYEB, NEBRASKA CITY E subject first assigned me by your secretary was Forestry and entals. On my request this was shortened, leaving the subject of ry to some one more directly engaged in this line of work.

Unfortunately this Nebraska sun. which enables us to excel the east in the growing of corn, is too strong for some of the finest ornamentals of the cast and it is impossible to grow them here unless we provide the proper conditions. To provide these conditions we must study and practice forestry to the extent of knowing what kind of trees to plant for the results wanted and then to set groves and shelterbelts of sufficient size to get these results. The broad leaf trees, especially the elm and soft maple, so common here dry out the ground too badly and do not give enough pro - tect ion in winter and early spring. We must therefore rely on the evergreens. In purely ornamental planting we can use a large variety of pine, fir, spruce, and arborvit*. but in most cases it is better to restrict ourselves to one or two of the best species, and there are few farms where a small evergreen grove will not pay large returns in the way of r to the lots and buildings and later fuel and lumber. El a grove of an acre or two can hardly be called a forest, and provide exactly forest conditions, yet it will enable you to grow v Inch would not survive a year in the open. As an example of this I may mention that at one of the winter meet - ings of this socieiy a few years ago I asked whether it were possible to grow rhododendrons and azaleas out of doors in this state. The answer was a decided no. it was too cold in winter and too hot in summer; had been tried by several and found wanting. I wrote to Prof. Sar - if the Arnold Arl&gt;oreuini connected with Harvard University and he replied tliat there was probably too much lime in this soil for plants of this nature to do well. Acting on this suggestion we dug a pit and filled it with well rotted sod mixed with a liberal proportion of cow manure, hoping that the large amount of manure would neutralize to some extent the excess of lime. We dog this pit on the north side of an opening in a small grove of white pine and planted a few rhododendrons and azaleas the next spring with high hopes for success. It was exposed, however, to the afternoon sun and while the Azalea mollit has done well, but one rhododendron is now living and that is badly damaged by sunscald. On the south side of this opening we set some rhododendrons in the shade of the pines, with close low branched trees elose by on all sides except the north and here they have grown finely and blossomed every year since planting. They were not hurt even by this spring's frost and snow which did so much damage to the fruit crop. I feel sure that R. maximum, Catawbiense. and any of the hardier hybrids can be successfully grown in southeast Nebraska if the conditions are right. These are briefly, absolute protection against the hot sun and winds on the south and west, some protection from high winds on all sides, very careful. If any, culti - vation as the roots are close to the surface, a good mulch the year around, and in winter a little extra protection of leaves or straw over the roots </seg>

In addition to the general work offered in the school, various special courses are given to college students, as landscape gardening, plant breeding, etc. The college courses are designed to fit students for teachers in high schools and to give the necessary preliminary training for those who will later become teachers in agricultural colleges or investigators in experiment stations. When we are able to arrange for our students more of the practical experience which can only be had in commercial establishments, we shall be able to recommend our graduates for positions as superin - tendents of fruit farms and the like, for which There seems to be con - siderable demand at present. To summarize, during the past year 400 students received the in - struction in the school and college courses in horticulture. A little leu than half of these received lectures only and for a comparatively short period at that. The other 200 took the work throughout the school year and had practice work in the laboratory or Held. It is a practice or laboratory work that is at once the most important for the student and the most difficult for the department to give. The Importance of labora - tory work I need not urge upon you. You know that to attempt to teach many of these things that must be taught in horticulure by mere lectures or text book study would result in practical failure. The difficulty of the laboratory work will also be apparent to you when you realize that an instructor can handle no more than ten students at a time in practice work in hortieulturs If he would do work of any value. Indeed, there are certain exercises-, such for Instance as pruning trees, in which an instructor cannot do good work if he attempts to handle more than five students at a time. Laboratory work is necessarily expensive, therefore, both as to assistants and as to room. I wish I might at this time tell you of the plans fo- the improvement and the extension of our work in Instruction for next year. But I am obliged If I say anything to tell you that the work for next year will be greatly curtailed owing to lack of help and to my failure to secure the new building, which I may add is certainly needed as much at least as any of the departmental build - ings that will be erected at the farm during the present biennium. Two years ago we had to drop the practice work with the short course stu dents from lack of proper facilities Now we have abandoned the labora - tory work with the whole first year class of the three^years course in the Agricultural School. The 150 or more boys in the first year will hereafter get what horticulture they can from lectures alone. While the department will extend its work somewhat by offering instruction to the girls who will be admitted next year, and while it will be able to strengthen the college courses considerably, this cannot compensate en - tirely for the curtailment In the school course* made necessary by lack of proper facilities. The work of instruction mimt remain prarticmlly »♦ » standstill for thp next two yparx lit loam. </seg>
            <seg id="p054">54 EXPERIMENT STATION WORK IN HORTICULTURE. The experiments now being carried on by the Department of Horti - culture are very similar to those that have been In progress for some time. Some of the tests which will be of most interest to you will be mentioned here. In 1901 an experiment was begun in orchard tillage. Eight plats of three-quarters acre each were planted to various tree fruits. In some it the plats cultivated crops, such as vegetables or corn, were grown. In »ne plat small grain was raised. Another plat received clean culti - vation throughout each year. Other plats were cultivated during early summer and given over to a cover-crop during fall. These methods of culture were continued for the first five years. At the end of that time one of the plats was seeded to alfalfa, one to clover, and one to a mixture of grasses. In another plat the weeds were allowed to grow, and are mowed two or three times a year. Another plat was mulched with straw. In two of the plats the cultivation and cover-crop method has been con - tinued, and in one plat thorough, clean cultivation is given as in the early part of the test. It is yet too early to determine what will be the final result of the methods now in use. During the first few years of the test the trees which were given clean cultivation made the best growth, though the plats in which cultivated crops were grown and those in which cover crops were used were not far behind. One very noticeable result of the test so far Is the great amount of soil erosion that takes place in the plat which has received clean cultivation. The plats where a cover-crop has been plowed under each year have washed very little, while In the plat that has been given clean cultivation with - out the addition of anv vegetable matter to the soil the black surface ■oil has nearly all washed awav. We have been obliged indeed to put In board dims to stop the washing to this plat. A few vears ago a small orchard was planted to various fruit trees for the purpose of testlne a counle of methods of pruning. The orchard was divided into three equal plats, one of which has not been pruned at •11. A second plat has been given moderate pruning such as is advocated by many horticulturists of this state. The other nlat has been pruned more severely. In addition to the ordinary thinning out of the limbs, the annual growth has been headed back considerably each veor. With some trees, such as nlnms. peaches, and certain varieties of pears and apples, heading ba&lt;-k has seemed to be advisable. The results indicate, however, that with cherries ench a method of nrunine: Is unnecessary. During the past two veurs the Department of Horticulture in co-onera i. on with *he United States Department of Agriculture, has been engaged In snrayine demonstrations in various annle orchards in eaVern Ne - braska. Last vear the work was done in co-onenMnn with t*&gt;e United Sta»es Dennrtroent of Aeri'M'lture.

The cost of making five applications of the spraying material was about 23 cents on the average. The value of the unsprayed trees averaged 80 cents per tree. The value of the fruit from the sprayed trees, minus the cost of spraying, was $1.66, leaving a gain of 86 cents per tree, or more than the total value of the unsprayed fruit. This year's demonstrations were abandoned in all but one of the orchards, owing to the freezes. The Department of Horticulture is conducting the spraying work alone in this orchard. Experiments are being carried on on a small scale in two other orchards to determine if possible what strength of Bordeaux mixture can be used to control scab without injury to the fruit. rmong other lines of work wilh fruits might be mentioned the breed - work. For some years the department has been engaged in the production of seedling apples, and has now several hundred seedlings, only two of which have fruited so far. The object of this work is to produce a hardy winter apple, that is, one which will keep during the winter in the ordinary cellar and still be as hardy in tree as the Duchess. Results of value cannot be expected in such work for a number of years yet. Recently the breeding work has been extended to include peaches and raspberries. The department now has several hundred peach seed lings growing, all of known parentage, and a few hundred raspberry seedlings. I believe that it is possible to unite the hardiness of some of our hardy seedlings with the better quality of fruit and the more diversified season of ripening of our budded sorts. Some very careful experiments are being carried on at present to determine the exact cause of winter killing in plants of various kinds, and to find means of lessening winter injury. The result of this work will be published in due time. tin addition to the experiments noted above, the station has growing nerous varieties of fruits and ornamental plants. While this work cannot be said to be exactly experimental, since we are making no systematic methods at variety testing, yet the growing of considerable numbers of varieties of fruit Is an important part of our work. It is our aim to have growing on the Experiment Station every variety of orchard and small fruits recommended by the State Horticultural Society for any fruit district of the state and every variety recommended by the American Pomological Society for District No. 8 of the United States. We have been unable as yet to secure from Nebraska nurserymen a number of varieties that are recommended by the Horticultural Society. In addition to tbe3e standard varieties we are adding to our orchards and gardens from time to time the more promising of the new varieties that are constantly being introduced. We have now about 100 varieties of apple, 25 varieties of pear, 30 varieties of peach, 50 varieties of plum, and 20 varieties of cherry. In the line of small fruits we do not have so extensive a list of varieties but will add to our small fruit planting </seg>
            <seg id="p056">56 materially next season. In connection with this variety work I should mention the collection of shade and ornamental trees, shrubs, and vines which we are getting together in our newly-established arboretum. The planting on the arboretum was begun the past spring, when there were set out 46 species and varieties of maple. 24 poplar, 17 willow, 13 linden. 9 walnut and hickory, "&gt; catalpa. M miscellaneous, or a total of 124 ■s and varieties of trees. The planting also included 58 varieties of roses, about 60 varieties of lilac. 23 spirea. II mock orange. 8 privet, x althea, 8 sumac. 7 deutzia, and M miscellaneous shrubs and vines; a total of 224 species and varieties of shrubs and the like. The first year'R planting, then, includes nearly i'.'jii species and varieties of plants, all of which are labeled correctly so far as we are able, the label showing i he correct botanical name and some of the more common synonyms, as well as the common name. Of course the work on the arboretum is only nicely begun. It is our purpose to plain n few groups of tree« and shrubs each year and to make tlvse sroups include as many varie - ties as we are able to secure. In addition to the work already mentioned, the department is carry ing on a few tests with vegetables. The most important of these are potato and sweet corn experiments. The object of the sweet corn expe - riment, which is being carried on in connection with the United States Department of Agriculture, is to determine the value of Nebraska-grown sweet corn seed as compared with that produced in other sections. There is, as you perhaps know, a great deal of sweet corn grown for seed in Nebraska, and you may be familiar also with the fact that there is a prejudice in the east against western-grown sweet corn. It is our purpose to determine whether or not this prejudice has any basis in fact. L Various experiments in potato growing have been carried on during past few years and are being continued iluiing the present summer. These relate principally to methods of preparing the land and planting, to size of seed pieces, quantity of seed and the like, and to source of seed. During the present season a number of varieties of potatoes are being compared. Some of the more important results secured in potato (Crowing were recently published in Bulletin 97. PROPOSED WORK In addition to the experimental work outlined above, there are three important lines of work that should be started by the Department of Horticulture at one? and which it is my purpose to start just as soon as funds for that purpose can be secured. These are, orchard experi - ments in eastern Nebraska, potato tests in the northwestern part of the state, and various horticultural experiments at the North Platte sub - station. Our work in connection with the spraying demonstrations carried on in eastern Nebraska last year has indicated quite clearly that while ppraying is extremely important it is only one of the Important things </seg>
            <seg id="p057">57 which should be done to bring thp fruit-growing industry of eastern Nebraska up to what it might be. You are well aware, and the fact must give every loyal Nebraska horticulturist some concern, that very little in the way of orchard planting in eastern Nebraska has been done during the past ten years. There are any number of small commercial orchards in eastern Nebraska from ten to sixteen years old, but very few orchards* younger than that. Moreover. orchardlsts and farmers who were successful some years ago are now complaining that the fruit business is not profitable. When we look over some of the comparatively young orchards which are still In fair shape notwithstanding the neglect they have had to contend with, we cannot help wondering how many of them will be profitable ten years from now. An apple orchard will usually come into bearing younger when neglected than when givrn good care, but it will Just as truly become unprofitable early. Practically all of the young orchards in eastern Nebraska are greatly in need of systematic spraying. Only a few less are in great need of Judicious pruning. Some need applications of manure Some need tillage. Many of them need a combination of all of these. I believe that the station could no* do better for the horticultural interests of eastern Nebraska than to carry on co-operative tests in a number of orchards to show what might be accomplished by proper methods of spraying, pruning, tillage and manuring. There is no use commencing such co-operative ex - periments until the station is able to put a competent man in the field to superintend the work. The Horticultural Department has in a number of cases attempted experiments of just this nature and they have always come to naught because the owners could not give the necessary care at the proper time. We should have a field man who could spend practically his entire time during summer in superintending this co-operative work in orchard management. P; time has come when experimental work in horticulture should rted at the North Platte substation. It Is true that a few fruit have been planted at the station, but nothing of value can be expected to result from this work until we can afford to keep a man at the substation during the summer whose first business shall be the care of the fruits started. The lines of work which it seems to me are of first importance in the region of the North Platte substantion are first, to establish an orchard of standard sorts of fruits and to give the trees such treatment as will be calculated to insure their growth. This would be simply to demonstrate that fruit trees can be grown in that region Of course such demonstrations have been made already in a number of places in western Nebraska by private parties, but that If no argument against making the demonstration over on the substation. \s time goes on and ♦he station develops, there will be hundreds of people see the. trees on the North Platte station where one would see 'hem on private grounds. In addition to this demonstration work, ex - periments should be undertaken to show the actual value of windbreaks </seg>
            <seg id="p058">58 for fruit plantations and to compare various methods of tillage, mulch - ing, and the like, as a means of growing horticultural crops in that dry section. Something should be done also in the way of windmill irrigation of small fruit end vegetable gardens. Pi potato industry is one of the most important branches of agri - e in northwest Nebraska. Up to the present time the station has almost nothing which would be of direct benefit to the potato growers of that section. It is hoped that some work along this line may be started within a year or two. These are only a few of the things which should be done at once. I speak of them specially because they seem more important to me than some of tfcp other things which might be done. Scarcely a week passes without some problem being presented from some part of the state or other which needs attention from the Horticultural Department of the station. My department is absolutely unable, however, to extend its work with its present funds. Even though some of the lines of work which should be taken up at once are more important than some that arc now under way, we cannot consider dropping our present investi - gations until we have secured definite results. Unless we can secure better support for station work, we cannot, therefore, undertake any of these new lines of work, no matter how important they may be. DISCUSSION* Professor Burnett: I would like to mention the matter of agricultural education in the University. The growth in the number of students in the Agricultural School in the last ten years has been very rapid. In this past year there were 430 students or more in the agricultural courses. You may know and you may not know that the work we are offering here is of the high school grade. We take boys sixteen years old or over who have completed the eighth grade. They have three years of work in this school and then they are usually called back to the farms I have been impressed with the fact that very few of the young men who come to the University select the agricultural courses. And I believe It is incumbent upon societies like this to call the attention of the young men who are entering the University to the fact that to graduates of the agricultural courses there are more good positions open and more opportunities offered than to almost any other line of work they might pursue. I think this should be impressed upon the young men who enter the University during the next few years. The young men in these courses are qualified from an educational point of view to take up these positions awaiting them over the country. And from this time forward the work in these agricultural and horti cultural courses will be given here at the farm. We have better libra rlrs and superior facilities for technical work than are available at the University down in the city. Our professors in these courses should be here all of the time, for we believp that agriculture and horticulture </seg>
            <seg id="p059">59 E prosper more here at the farm than at the University down town, ih that this society would mention these facia to the young men are coming to the University, and call their attention to the work at the farm. Dr. Bessey: That is very good advice and those are excellent ideas that Professor Burnett has given. I see the matter as it appears on the campus down in the city. And I find that a great majority of the boys who come to the University from the farms every year are entering courses other than agricultural. They will enter the engineering courses, law, or anything but the courses that have to do with agriculture and horticulture. There is such a demand for young men thoroughly trained along agricultural lines that we cannot begin to supply the demand. The President: This is a matter in which our society can help by giving advice and information wherever we can, and the more we do, the more it will help agriculture and horticulture here at the farm. Another matter I wish to call the attention of all here to, and that is the membership of our society. Any one can become a member of our society by the payment of the regular dues to the secretary. Men. bership in this society is not limited to only those who are Interest** in fruit-growing or nursery work. All members receive free the annual report of the society and the monthly bulletins, which are on matters of current interest. I believe we need a committee on final resolutions, and I will appoint Messrs. Swan, Christy, and Green to serve on this committee. Meeting adjourned to July 18th, 9:30 a. m. Thursday, July 18th, 9:30 a. m. Pi President: First on our program this morning will be a paper ardy Perennials," by C. S. Harrison. PERENNIALS. C. S. HABBISOX, YORK The flowers of this class are remarkably hardy. While we do not plant trees In the West In the fall on account of the danger of winter killing, yet it is the proper time to plant perennials. The tops, of course, kill down, but the roots remain unharmed. It is well to plant them early enough so that little rootlets will form, as that will help them for early starting in the spring. People often have an idea because it Is not safe to plant trees in the fall that it is not the proper thing to plant hardy flowers, and so it is neglected until spring. When spring comes people are too busy and the work is often neglected too long, and the plants are frequently very much advanced so that it is quite a shock to more them at that time of year. We often have calls for Peonies and Phlox** </seg>
            <seg id="p060">60 rthey are nearly a root high, and It Is a very serious matter to them when so far advanced. Perennials are, In the main, much more beautiful than annuals. They strike their roots deeper and have more sources to draw from with which to make beautiful flowers. Of course, the Peony takes the lead of everything. Fifty years ago there were about fifty kinds and now there are about three thousand and the number is increasing all the while. We have far too many sorts and some of our American propagators are discarding large quantities that are far better than many of the named imported ones There is an immense amount of seedlings coming on. Mr. Rosenfield of our state has had splendid success in originating some fine sorts which have come to the front. Mr. Richardson, formerly of Dorchester, Mass., left the world some splendid varieties. Mr. Hollls. of South Waymouth, Mass., has had remarkable success in originating new sons. We have purchased some of his finest. They cost from five to ten dollars a root and are cheap at that. There are a great many ihousands of these seedling Peonies now on the way that will soon be heard from. A large field of these flowers is one of the most attractive spectacles on earth. The manifold blending of colors presents a very fascinating and atttactive appearance. The field looks like one vast carpet of indescribable beauty. These flowers are very hardy and gen - erally double about every year. We have found, by close observation, however, that there is a great difference in them, some are exceedingly sensitive and some will endure the vicissitudes of our changing climate. In the spring where there should be flowers you often find little black dots which shows they have been nipped in the bud. The English varieties sent out by Kelway seem far more sensitive than the French varieties. Some of our American sorts are remarkably floriferous and Eit, for instance, the Golden Harvest which originated in Nebraska, tremely hardy in our Northern states and Manitoba. With a little tlon the time of Peony blooming can be prolonged. We ourselves have picked them the fifth of May and the same year the fifth of July. Next In importance comes the Phloxes. These are natives of America. They were taken to France and have been developed in a remarkable degree. Like Indian Maidens, put in the most congenial surroundings of civilization until they have been transformed into persons fit for the courts of kings. The wild phlox has flowers the size of a dime. Then by long and patient experimenting the flowers became as large as a quarter, then as large as a fifty-cent piece and now many of them are larger than a silver dollar. We ourselves have originated at least twenty kinds of exquisite beauty with very large flowerets. There is a wonder - ful fascination in t ringing new flowers out of the unknown. In this realm one wields the wand of a wizard, bringing into view things never before seen by mortal. I am often amazed as I look among my new creations when they turn their smiling faces to me and I am filled with delightful amazement at what I have been able to accomplish. </seg>

            <seg id="p063">63 GENERAL DISCUSSION tMr. Keyser: On this question of hedges. I was going to put out a ret hedge. Stoki -This has a beautiful lavender colored flower. Unfor- tunately the seed is mostly gathered in the South. H is necessary to cover with a heavy coating of leaves to keep them safely through our severe winters. The Digitalis oe Fox Glove is a very showy Bower, but one must use the greatest care and cover them heavily with leaves or they are sure to winter kill. Tue Cokeopsis is a beautiful garden flower. It blooms a long time. It is fairly hardy. There are other perennials which we have tested and discarded. We have mentioned those that are generally successful. Plant a plenty of them an&lt;l you have blooms from the early spring until the hard frosts of autumn. Mr. Harrison: You will not find a privet hedge that will stand our Nebraska climate for any considerable time. Mr. Beltzer: The California privet in our town is still very fine and it is now twenty-five years old. It died clear down the first year or two. but now it is fine. Prof. Emerson: We have a privet here on the farm that has been here since 1894, and it has never been injured in the least. The Tama- risk here is beautiful for a hedge, aud it is perfectly hardy. Mr. Harrison: A good many of the Tamarisks die in the first two or three years and then come out again. The President: Has any one had any experience with the Japan Quince? Mr. Mohler: We have it with us at Falls City and it is very good. We have also some very fine Mulberry hedges lr is one of the most beautiful hedges we have. The President: Mr. Like, of Shenandoah. Iowa, has a very pretty hedge of Black Hills Spru. c Mr. Pollard: I think one of the most beautiful hedges we have can be made of the Swedish Juniper. The Siberian arborviiae is also fine. The Swedish Juniper though is very good. It is pretty hardy too, and looks fine when trimmed about four feet high. I think roses used for a hedge would be very beautiful. An evergreen hedge though is green all winter. Mr. Harrison: I have seen a hedge of Norway Spruce, which is forty or forty-five years old, and it is certainly fine. It is now a solid dumb and one of the most beautiful things you ever laid eyes on. But It would not do here. The President: It there Is no further discussion of this question, we will take up a little matter of business. I think we should be looking forward to our winter meeting and making arrangements for it. </seg>
            <seg id="p064">64 Mr. C. S. Harrison: It would be better for the society and all con if we could meet out here. Efhe President: I think we can give the Secretary a litile leeway, and him arrange for the room or place of meeting for the coming winter Mr. Brown: I believe for the good of the .society though that we should meet here at the Farm. But I don't think we should meet here unless we can secure better accommodations than we have had previously The President: I do not think there is any question but that we can secure a suitable room in which to hold our meeting.

I am very sorry to announce that our President, Mr. Harrison, is out of the city and will not be with us at this session. First on our program we will listen to the address of welcome, by Dr. Bessey. WELCOME. ADDRESS OF CHARLES E. BESSEY The ultimate purpose of this society is not essentially different from that of the University. You are teachers of one branch of knowledge, and your pupils are the people of the state, whi'.e each University pro - fessor is likewise a teacher of some branch of knowledge, and his pupils are also the people of the state. It is fitting, therefore, that we should come together now and then, and especially fitting that you should meet here upon the grounds, and in the buildings of the University. But there is a better reason still why you should meet with us. Look out upon the campus and see the throngs of young men and women hurrying from class to class eager to learn the many things they find here to study. These three thousand and more young people are your boys and girls whom you have sent to the University to learn those Es that may fit them for profitable living. It is eminently proper you should come here from time to time to make the acquaintance e men under whom your children are studying. This year you meet in this new building which we have named "The Temple," to whose erection many of you contributed. It is the first University building erected by other than public funds, and we trust that it is the forerunner of more buildings yet to come from private munifi - cence. Here are provided in this Temple commodious rooms in which your sons and daughters may meet in their literary, scientific, and musical societies. Here they will find a reading room, in which eventu - ally they may read their home papers with home news, as well as the larger dailies with the current news of the world. Here is a theater for public speaking and other exercises, while still more important are the rooms occupied by the Young Men's and Young Women's Christian As - sociations. I am glad, on behalf of the Chancellor, the Faculties, and the Regents. to welcome you to the University, and I am especially g'.ad to welcome you to this newest University building. We trust that your meetings in (87) </seg>

He always leads us in the right way .il our program this after noon is a paper entitled "A i rom Nature in Tree Growing in Central Nebraska." by Mr. .1 D. Tteam. of Broken Bow i: IN TREE ft HO WING IN NEBRASKA. \ LESSON I KoM NATUI CENTRAL D. BEAM KN In the teoncn of Iowa where I lived when a boy, il was the universa custom when preparing the ground for garden vegetables, to throw the soil up in beds or ridges, and when my boyish inquisitiveness caused me to inquire why they did this, the answer I received was that this was the most successful method of growing such things; but when I came to Nebraska in 1878 I was very much surprised to find the farmers grow ing all kinds of garden vegetables under what is known as the lev culture system, and the reason they gave for doing so was that the vege tables succeeded much better in dry seasons under the system of level planting and level culture. This I found, after several years' experienc to be true. And when I was ready to prepare my ground for my orchard and windbreaks, I concluded that if level culture was best for garden vegetables in Central Nebraska, it must necessarily be better for tree growing. So I prepared my ground, set my trees and cultivated them with this level culture idea kept fully in view all of the time. After I had worked along these lines for ten long years and had the ground in my orchard and windbreaks as level as a floor, I began to study nature's methods of growing trees and grass and weeds, and I had not pursued my investigations very far until I found that the good old dame had a lesson in store for me. Yes, I founa that when she wanted to grow a thrifty tree, some tall grass or some large weeds, that she was not content to plant them on level ground and give them level culture. No. sir, when she wanted to do something extra in growing trees or grass or weeds, she always and invariably hunted for a depression in the surface of the ground or a little hollow between two ridges or a favored spot in a canyon. In fact, she always chose a place that received the benefit of more water than fell on it in rain or snow, or at least one so situated that it absorbed all the water that did fall on it. And when I began to fully realize this to be true and to carefully observe he natural renditions by which I was surrounded on every hand, why, lo and behold! President: On behalf of the ■octetj 1 wish lo heart il. l&gt;r. Bessey for his very kind welcome and 10 assure him thai \v always glad 10 meet here at the University and to have Him with us </seg>
            <seg id="p069">69 I could see the baDdwrltlng in large letters written ou every hillside iu every valley, In every canyon; yes, I could see It written In every corn Held, in every grain field, and then I wondered and wondered why I had not seen it — why everybody had not seen it. About this time I first read about what Cornell University was doing in the line of introducing na ture study in the rural schools of the state of New York and I immed - iately said, "Yen, that is just the thiug, thar is just what we need to round out and complete our system of rural education. Something prar tical, something that will develop the natural faculties of the child ami enable him to observe what his eyes see and to reason from cause to effect regarding the things he observes." Yes, here I had practical proof of this proposition, in my own experience, for I could plainly see that if 1 had received, when a boy, the kind of training that would have de - veloped the faculty of observing and reasoning about the things that I saw, that I would have learned more about how to grow a tree in Cen - tral Nebraska during the first ten days that I spent in Custer County, than I did learn during the first ten years of actual experience in trying to grow trees there. I then began to observe more closely as to the methods my neighbors were employing in their attempt to grow trees, and I found that nineteen out of every twenty of them had so cultivated their ground, after their trees were planted, that they had their trees standing on a ridge, "just the kind of a place that dame nature would have selected for her short grass and small weeds." They had heaped up the soil over the roots of their trees in such a manner that it would indicate that they thought rainwater was the most dangerous element that could come in contact with the roots of their trees and had thus heaped up the dirt in order to carry the water away from the tree as quickly as possible. E.fter comparing dame nature's method of growing trees with that of neighbors, I congratulated myself on having gotten half way to the t method when I adopted the level culture system. But just then I happened to remember that many a fellow in the past had gotten half way to success and then failed, and the great problem that confronted me was, bow to retain the advantages of my partial success, in the way of level culture, and yet gain the Iwnefits of the lesson I had learned from nature. My first move was to plow my orchard both ways with a stirring plow, having the back furrows come in the middle of the spaces between the rows and the dead furrows come at the tree rows, using a single horse and a boy to finish up the furrow; and as I had set my trees quite deep when I set them out, I succeeded in getting quite a ridge between the rows and the surface of the ground around the most of the trees quite a little below level, and all trees planted in the orchard since then have been put in low ground. By careful cultivation with a reversible ex - tension orchard disk throwing the dirt from the trees towards the center of the space between the rows. I have kept the depression around thf </seg>
            <seg id="p070">70 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL BOCIBTT. most of the trees so low that it will ho'.d from one to five barrels of water before any of it would run away, thus making something of a reservoir for the surplus water during heavy rains. I also deserted the level culture system in growing my trees for my windbreaks. I plowed my ground for these trees in lands about sixteen feet wide, having the dead furrow come where I wanted my tree row to stand. Then I dug this dead furrow up as thoroughly as I could with sub - soiler and disk, then planted my cedar trees about seven or eight feet apart in the row, using the same method of cultivation that I used in the orchard to keep the ground ridged up between the rows and the trees in the low ground. If you do not have a reversible disk, you will find that a good boy, a steady horse and an old-fashioned stirring plow will be a great help in keeping the ridge up and the weeds down. By having the ground sloping gradually from the center of the space between the tree rows in toward these trees the same as I tried to have it in the orchard, all surplus moisture will run toward the trees and all trash and leaves will drift toward the trees rather than from them, while the tree that stands upon a ridge exposed to wind and sun can keep neither moisture nor mulch about its roots. This method of growing a windbreak or forest trees for a timber lot has great advantages over the old method of planting forest trees four feet apart each way as the government required us to do on our timber c.aims, as it would enable the grower to cultivate his land between the rows, "a very essential feature in Central Nebraska," long years after he would have to stop cultivation if his trees were set four feet apart each way. If the rows were sixteen feet apart and the trees close together in the row, there would be a good drive-way between the rows if the grower cared to haul out the limbs that were trimmed off or the extra trees that were thinned out. Besides a mower could be run through to cut down weeds, or a crop of alfalfa if he concluded to seed the open spaces down •after his trees were well grown. Man has made some wonderful improvements on some of nature's pro - ductions, or rather he has assisted nature very greatly in her evolu - tionary process of production. But she is a wonderfully intelligent old dame and there is much yet for us to learn from her if we will only get our eyes open and set our thinking machinery to work. For centuries untold she has had the wind, the birds and animals carrying the seeds of plants and trees for heP and she has almost in - variably planted these seeds where the soil and conditions were best suited to them. At least, we find them growing in such places and the question as to whether from her knowledge of conditions she planted them there in the first place, or whether she had to learn by experience, matters little to us just now. kin our section of the state she has tried to teach us some valuable ons. She has planted the seeds of tne drought-resisting grasses on the rt ridges and the seeds of the grasses that require more moisture on </seg>
            <seg id="p071">71 t lower ground ; and we scarcely find an instance where she ha* - pted to grow a tree on a sharp ridge like that produced by the most of our Nebraska people in the cultivation of their trees. And where she has done this, it would seem that she did it purposely to tearh us ■ lesson, for the tree is always a failure. The President: We will now hear from Mr. Brown, of Geneva, on the subject "Shade and Ornamental Trees." SHADE AND OR V A MENTAL TREES A. J. BROWX, GENEVA. My earliest recollections are of the forest. I first went to school in an old log school house on the bank of a lake with woods on two sides of it. My home was a log house surrounded by timber. My play hours at home and at school were "nearly all spent under the trees. I can not remember when I was not acquainted with the oaks, the linden, poplars, hickory and willows, and very early in life I learned to know the maples, birch, beech, ash, elms, etc. We are a nation of tree planters by instinct, and is it any wonder! Most of us were reared in or near the woods, and for thousands of ye*r» our forefathers dwelt in the forests. Their first temples were the groves and the great oaks were to them something sacred. We come of a race that has lived from the earliest dawn of history in the land of the oak, the tireh and the maple, and now when the warm spring wind blows, the fresh earth smell awakens the tree fever in the blood and we plant as if by instinct. It is this instinct, or whatever you may choose to call it, that has been the most potent factor in the changing of the almost treeless plains of forty years ago, to the beautiful Nebraska of todav, and as the years come and go. this tree planter, as in the past, still continues to plant. At first trees were planted principally for fruit and for shelter from the sweeping winds, but in later years with the increase of wealth and leisure, more attention has been paid to beautifying our homes, and for this reason I want to say a few words about shade and ornamental , r p pc . I shall endeavor in as few words as possible to give you the results of my experience and observations covering a period of thirty-five years in Nebraska. rhave a much larger list of trees that are successfully grown in this han is commonly supposed, and the only reason that it is not larger, is that we have confined our planting too much to the trees, the thing nearest at hand, and have not experimented with the purely ornamental trees as largely as we have with fruits. As you well know. Nebraska is a large state, with widely differing soil and climatic conditions, which in many sections are unfavorable to tree growth, yet there is probably not a place In the state where some </seg>
            <seg id="p072">72 sort of trees cannot be grown successfully, and It is wise for the begin - ner to confine his planting principally to such kinds as are growing nearest him. and for experimental purposes plant those that seem most promising. In this way our list of really desirable trees may be largely increased. This fact of widely different soil and climatic conditions makes imi&gt;ossible a long list of trees that are good for all parts of the state, yet there arc a few that can bo recommended for general planting Cr the entire state with reasonable expectation of success. In the west - part it is mainly a question of moisture and where the deficiency can made up by irrigation the list can be made much larger. This society has divided the state into nineteen horticultural dis - tricts for the purpose of making a list of varieties of fruits that can be recommended for planting for all parts, but I shall use only three gen - eral districts, which, with some exceptions. 1 Rhall note will be sufficient for my purpose. It must be remembered that soil and climate conditions cannot be defined by arbitrary lines, but must gradually merge one into the other. .-onsequently varieties that will thrive on the edge of one district will also thrive on the adjoining part of another district. For convenience I shall speak of these divisions as the eastern, central and western dis- The eastern district is that part of the state east of a line drawn Hcross the state north and south passing along the west line of Lancaster rounty. The west line of the central district Is the west line of Purnas Custer and Brown counties and on the north across the state, and the western district the balance of the state west of this line Earn aware that there are very wide soil and climatic differences in western district and my reasons for placing this territory all in one let is that I do not know enough about the extreme northwestern counties to make intelligent recommendations to planters, and my rec- Braendations unless otherwise stated, will apply only to the southern f. and the areas under Irrigation in the north part of this district. Every observer in orossinsr Nebraska from east to west will notice that the native timber changes very rapidly both in variety and size, the trees growing smaller and smaller as you go west and finally almost disappearing as the western border is reached, and just so the success ful cultivation of trees is increasingly difficult and the number of sorts that can be grown decreases as we move westward, except under trriga tlon. The following are successfully grown over the eastern district: A«h; Box Elder: Boleana Poplar: White Birch, both European and American; Bechtel's Double Flowering Crab; Catalpa Speciosa and Teas' Japan Hybrid; Carolina Poplar; Elm. American White and Red; Purple Leaf Elm; Horse Chestnut, American and European : Hackberry; Ken tucky Coffee Tree : European Larch : American Linden ; Lombardy Poplar : Maple, Soft or Silver, Sugar or Hard. Norway, and Weir's Cut Leaf. European Mountain Ash; all kinds of Oaks: Russian Mulberry; Russian </seg>
            <seg id="p073">73 Wild Black Cherry Weeping Trees: Cut-Lear Birch. Camperdown Elm. Mountain Ash and Teas' Mulberry. Evergreens: Abies Concolor. Pines — Austrian. Scotch, White, Pon - derosa and Contorta or Dwarf Rocky Mountain. Spruce— Black H11U. Colorado Blue, Bngleman, Douglass and Norway. There are also quite a number of kinds that do well in localities. Probably a few of these named will not do their best in the western part of this district, yet I have seen them all thriving west of the sixth meridian, many mile* wMt of the district line. For the central district we must modify our list somewhat, leaving out several that are very desirable in the eastern district. The following we have found adapted to the conditions prevailing in this district: Fah, Box Elder; White Birch, both European and American; Bechtel's lie Flowering Crab; Catalpa Speciosa and Teas" Hybrid; Elm, Ameri - white and red; Purple Leaf Elm. Hackberry, American Horse Chest - nut, Kentucky Coffee Tee; Maple. Soft or Silver and Weir's Cut Leaf; American Linden, Burr Oak, Pin Oak, Russian Olive. Russian Mulberry, Silver Leaf Poplar.

Spruces — Colorado Blue. Black Hills. Engleman and Doug lass. For the western district we can recommend for general planting only a few kinds, such as have shown great drouth resisting powers The following have been found good over most of the district: rah. Box Elder, Elm (white), Hackberry, Russian Olive, Russian erry, Honey Locust. Black Locust, Austrian Pine. Ponderosa Pine Black Hills Spruce. I With irrigation and also in favored places such as sheltered valleys 1 bottom lands, this list can be enlarged to embrace almost everything recommended for the central district, as indeed, under irrigation many things can be grown in the western district that will not succeed farther east where irrigation is impossible. As I said before. I am not familiar enough with the northwestern part of the state to be able to recommend very many kinds, but from the best information I have I believe that almost all of the trees that thrive in the southern part of this district will do equally as well in the north part, except perhaps the Russian Mulberry and Hackberry, and we might add some of the pines from the Black Hills, also the Jack Pine to our list for planting. Everyone is so well acqainted with most of the trees mentioned that no particular mention of them is necessary, still there are a few that have been mentioned and some that 1 have not. that I wish to speak about fn particular. </seg>
            <seg id="p074">74 Becbtel's Double Flowering Crab. This tree is very hardy and vigor - ous, attaining the size of a medium apple tree. In the spring it is cov - ered with large doub'e blossoms resembling a small pink rose, with the genuine crab apple blossom fragrance. Very desirable. Purple Leaf Elm is perfectly hardy and very symmetrical in habits of growth, resembling somewhat in form a maple. The fo'iage when first out has a purplish bronze color, turning to a very dark green in summer This is one of the handsomest trees in my collection and is worthy of i place on any lawn. The American Linden is one of the very best wherever it can be grown, has no bad habits or insect enemies that I know of. The blossoms appear in June and while not particularly handsome, they have a delight - ful fragrance, resembling the tuberose. On my grounds there is a deciduous Cypress that has stood three years and passed through 20 degrees below zero without injury, but what it will do in the future remains to be seen. The Ho eana is a Russian Poplar resembling the Lombardy in habits of growth, with a foliage like the silver leaf poplar. Winter cold dots not affect it, still it does not seem quite at home in the central part of the state. There is one here at Geneva, that has been planted twenty-one years, has attained a height of forty feet with a diameter of fourteen inches. They are worthy of a trial anywhere in the state. kWe need to pay more attention to the Oaks. Nearly all varieties are ives of the eastern district, and the Burr or Mossy Cup is native one hundred and fifty miles west of the Missouri River. While the oaks are slow growing, yet they are among the handsomest trees we have and transplant easily. The Regal Willow is another good tree that will bear closer acquaint - ance. It has a peculiar silvery foliage very much like the Russian Olive. The whole family of willows are worthy of more extended planting. So far as I know we do not have a good weeping willow in Nebraska. We are experimenting with a Russian Willow and from what we now know it promises well. ■pa Bungei is a very hardy and handsome tree that is asking for tended recognition. Its only fault so far as known is breaking 1 storms. The Norway Mapl- while recommended for the eastern district only, is successfully grown well toward the central part of the central district. It should be free'y planted at least over the east third of this district. It is the handsomest of the maples. I believe that there are very many trees that will grow well over much wider range than we now give them. We in Nebraska are neglecting this very important part of our work. We have as yet only touched upon the good things in store for us if we will but reach out and take them. The whole country is awaken - ing to the need of making homes more beautiful. We need more earnest careful experimental work along this line. The field is wide and the work Is great Let us aris*. go forward and possess the land. </seg>
            <seg id="p075">75 DISCUSSION Mr. Williams: What do you consider the distinction between the Norway Maple and Sugar Maple? Mr. Brown: The Norway Map'e has a heavier and much darker foliage than the Sugar Maple, and it has also a much wider range in Nebraska than the Sugar Maple. Mr. Williams: I could not distinguish between the leaves only of the two trees. Mr. Brown: It is easy enough for a man familiar with the two trees to distinguish between them. P Pollard: As I understand this question of ornamental trees, Jt not be a list for experimental purposes. Mr. Brown has named over the whole list of trees that grow in this country. He named a lot that are all good: they will most of them grow all right, but we don't want them. Some of them are not much good as an ornament around a bouse. When we plant a tree around the house we want it to stay there. Now a few of these trees will do well, but they don't enough of them answer the purpose of a good shade and ornamental tree. You don't want but two or three kinds of trees around the house if they are good ones and the right kind. The right kind in my mind is the White Elm. It will do you lots of good, because you have a real tree when you get it. Now, sc far as the Russian Olive and trees of that nature go they are not worth anything as trees around the home. Unless you t large ground that you want to use as an experiment ground, you place for this kind of trees around the house. I think the Elm iest tree possible to get. Mr. Harrison: How is the Siberian Arl&gt;orv Mr. Brown: That is very good. But the most beautiful tree is the Blue Spruce. That is something that is good and also very hardy. I would have some of them. We have planted a good many of these things, but I have come to the conclusion that there are very few people who have the time and money to p'ant all of these things. When a man is cut down to seventy years he seems to be always in a hurry and docs not have time for these things. rr.

This may be bets of the Nebraska Horticultural world interesting to me it is this because I know more about shade trees than any other line of horticulture. I came to this prairie country and have just grown up with the trees. My first impression of trees in Nebraska was in 1893, and my second impression is that there are more trees today than at that time. I have always noticed a lack of good trees, and a.s a result now almost anything looks good to me. I am glad to see Nebraska coming to the front in the line of trees. Iowa had its prairie days, but now there are groves all over the state. They give shade and protection and comfort to farm homw. Nebraska is coming that way now. I like to be in the gardes, with tree* and everything good about me It seems to me that with trees all around us we are closer to heaven.

Now with this knowledge, this society has divided the state up into districts (as you will see by map in this report), and have made a recommended Ms. for each district. This list is for the orchard for home use. I wish to further add that you should never plant less than two trees of a variety, and plant enough varieties so as to have ripe fruit all the time. Any family will use twice the fruit, and it will do them many times the amount of good, if they have it at hand and can pick it at will fresh from the tree, than they will if they have to depend In looking over the recommended list for the various fruit districts I note that it might mislead in that it recommends for general planting so and so. failing to give the number of trees of each variety there should be in a family orchard, therefore I will give a list about as I would divide the varieties were I planting an orchard of one hundred rir. Beltzer- The only objection to Brother Marshall's list that 1 can is that he has too many varieties. I have been here in Nebraska thirty years, and from my observations. I don't believe that we should recommend so many varieties of apples for the people out over th« state. It is well to experiment with different kinds of varieties, but not to recommend so many to the public. §A Member: I have been impressed by the tremendous progress the pie has made in the north. There have been train loads of apples ipped into Iowa this year. Our southern apples though are not hardy enough to go up north.

I think this would be sufficient. Duchess, Wealthy. Maiden's Bush, and some of the others are all good ones for summer. Professor Emerson: 1 would like to say a word about the name of this apple, usually called the Janet. The American Pomological Society km men ds the name "Rail's" instead of "Rail's Janet," as most people it now. The name should be simply "Rail's." P Marshall: It has been intimated that I recommend several varie - apples because that is the nurseryman's business — to sell as many s he can. That is not my idea. And besides the nurserymen not be so v&lt; ry keen for this, because they can afford to grow only two or three varieties much better than twenty or twenty-five. As to the list for the summer season, it should contain several varieties, because the season is so long. This list I have given can well be made a little larger for the Missouri river counties. The Nebraska farmer has room for nioro than two varieties. My idea is to keep from planting the same number of each variety, for some varieties are much E" ir to others. We should recommend lists for orchards containing one hundred trees, and proportioned in the right manner among rieties.

It has been known for some time that spraying will prevent injury from apple scab and codling moth It is generally conceded that by the application of proper spray materials we can secure a crop of apples larger in size and better in quality. But the question which the fruit grower would like to have answered is, "Does it pay to do this?" That is, does the increase in yield and quality of fruit pay for the expense of spraying? </seg>

However, all of these materials may be obtained cheaper if bought in large quantities. The expense will be reduced in proportion. The facilities for spraying may be greatly improved, such as having the water near the orchards, having an extra man to mix the material, and keep up supply for spray rgang in the orchards, and in various other ways the expense may reduced.

The reader will understand, of course, that these are the dates on .which the spray was actually applied in our work last year, and it must not be inferred that these would be the proper dates for other years. The exact date on which to spray cannot be given that will hold for every years. The proper time varies with the character of the weather during the season. In general we may say that the proper times to spray each year are as follows: First Spraying — Just before the tree comes into bloom 4 Total cost I. 9c 28.8c 7.2c Blair Orchard. '.

Fourth Spraying — Eight to nine weeks after the petals fall. Fifth Spraying — About eleven or twelve weeks after the petals fall These last two sprayings are not ordinarily given in Nebraska orchards, but they are necessary to effectually control the second brood of the codling-moth. Many orchardists are now beginning to deem them of great importance. It is certainly necessary to give at least one of the two last sprayings if the best fruit is to be produced, and it will remain for later experiments to determine whether or not both late sprayings would be profitable. Materials Ustu. — In both orchards Bordeaux mixture was used as the fungicide and either Paris green or lead arsenate as the insecticide. Bordeaux and Paris green were applied together for the first three sprayings and arsenate of lead was used alone in the last two. The Bor - deaux used was formed by using three pounds of copper sulphate and five pounds of lime to the barrel of water. Stronger formula of Bordeaux was not used through fear of injury to the leaves and fruit. The Paris green was added at the rate of one-fourth pound per barrel and the arsenate of lead at the rate of two pounds per barrel. Arsenate of lead was used in the last two sprayings because it will adhere to the foliage and fruit better than Paris green, and because Paris green is very liable to injure the foliage when applied late in tke season. It is now believed thai arsenate of lead should be used instead of Paris green, at least in the third spraying, because of the long period between the third and fourth sprayings, and because of the adhering qualities of the arsenate of lead just mentioned. It has been shown that spraying during the past year has been a paying venture. The average gain per tree due to spraying has been found to be $2.13. This represents a profit per acre over and above the cost of spraying of more than $85. The great benefit of spraying during the past year has been that it held the apples on the tree and brought them to maturity. On unsprayed trees the apples that began to form were immediately pounced upon by the codling-moth, and by picking time all the apples had either fallen from the tree or had been rendered unmarketable by the attacks of the codling-moth. The demonstration spraying work is not completed, but the work so far has been successful, and gives promise of good results in the future. Orchards in eight different locations in the state have been sprayed to test the financial benefits of spraying. They extend over the territory enclosed by the cities of Arlington, Pawnee City, Falls City, Nebraska City, and Blair. The number of trees sprayed amounts to 2,284. The age of the orchards varied from thirteen years to twenty-seven years. The yield per tree ranged from three bushels to eighteen bushels. The selling price of the fruit ranged from thirty-five cents per bushel to $3.50 per </seg>

In the facilities for getting water there was much variation, ranging from that of hauling up the water out of a well with a rope and bucket to that of turning on the faucet of a supply tank. And yet under all these varying conditions, spraying has been found to have been profitable in every case. Mr. President, I believe this work to be of importance. I believe it to be for the best Interests of the horticulture of the state. The words obtained show not only a profit from spraying, but they show upon their very face that good fruit can be raised In Nebraska, and that the raising of good fruit is profitable. In the course of years we can in this manner accumulate a great mountain of evidence showing beyond all dispute that we can plant apple trees in Nebraska, and be confident of a satisfactory return. This will stimulate the planting of fruit trees. These records of success in orcharding will arouse new hope in the hearts of our people, and in the end may we not hope for that condition so much desired by every true horticulturist — the state of Nebraska Cdded from end to end with thrifty apple trees yielding to us each r an abundant harvest? DISCUSSION ■Barker: I would like to ask what proportions were used of the id blue vitriol, for the Bordeaux mixture. Mr. Denny: We used for Bordeaux, three pounds of blup vitriol, and five pounds of lime to a barrel of water. Mr. Barker: What Is a barrel? Mr. Denny: Fifty gallons F'essor Emerson: I want to call your attention to the number of rom which this record was made. Twenty trees sprayed looks small nnmber. As a matter of fact 150 trees were sprayed, and only twenty trees were used to make the record from. It might be well to state In regard to these dates that they are not specific: it depends entirely upon the season. Mr. Denny: In general, the first spraying shonld come just before the tree comes into bloom. The second should come just after the petals fall; and the third should come In ordinary years about three weeks after the second. The next spraying should come along In the latter part of July. You can figure from worm to worm about fifty days: the first brood of worms comes out some time usually between the 15th and 25th of July. The spraying In the latter part of July win finish up the job. The late codling-moth worms come out a little later than this. Some give only one spraying for the second brood. We have no records to show whether or not It pays to give on* spraying or two In the later season. Mr \f arnhall * you give onlv one spravlng. when do you </seg>
            <seg id="p084">84 Mr. Denny: One of the most important sprayings is just after the petals fall. For two sprayings, give the second one In July. Mr. Marshall: If you were going to leave out one spraying, which one would you leave out? Mr. Denny: If I were going to leave one out, I do not know which one I would leave out; I would give four sprayings. When it comes to leaving out one spraying. I would hate to say which one to leave out, because they are all very important. There is good reason for using all of the sprayings. Until we know more about it, I would not leave out any one of the sprayings. I would give at least four sprayings. Question: Would these same sprayings apply to peaches, too? Mr. Denny: I do not know about peach spraying, for we have never done any of it. DISCUSSION Mr. Atkinson: You say that twenty trees were used from which to get this average fo.- your records. Were these twenty trees selected in a row or not? Mr. Denny: They were selected one right after the other, just as they came in the row. Mr. Christy: There has been some trouble about the spraying when parts of the material used were not good. Down south, where they do a good deal of spraying, they use poor stuff that is diluted, and it does no good at all. There should be some good test we could use to test whether or not the material we use is good. Mr. Denny: We have never yet come across any material that was not good. You could take your material to a chemist or send It to the experiment station here, where it will be analyzed free of charge, and they will let you know whether it is all right or not. I do not think that any one who is not a chemist could tell whether the materials were good or not. Mr. Swan: Don't these materials come under the pure food law? rlr. Denny: As I understand it. such materials as Paris green, etc not foods at all. Mr. Williams: About the records for 1906 — did you take a record at that time of the cost per tree? Mr. Denny: In six orchards scattered around over the state, about 23 cento per tree. Th&gt; value of the fruit from the sprayed trees was about $1.86. and the value of the fruit from the unsprayed trees was 80 cents. The average gain per tree in 1906 was about 86 cents over and above the cost of spraying. This year it was a little higher on account of the increased value of the fruit. Eessor Emerson: A point that Mr. Denny mentioned should be ized. and that is, that the cost of this spraying could be reduced. II see that the cost of material was seven-tenths cent, while the applying It was one and two-tenths cents per gallon Last year </seg>
            <seg id="p085">85 the cost of material in six orchards averaged just about one cent per gallon, and the cost of applying it in three orchards where hand pumps were used was about one and five-tenths cents per gallon. In the other three orchards where power pumps were used the cost was leas than one cent per gallon, cutting the expense of putting the material on the tree almost in half. This did not include the cost of the gasoline used, which was very slight. Mr. Hartley: There is a gentleman here who has had considerable experience in the growing of peaches in Michigan. I would like to hear from him on the question of spraying peaches. Mr. Barker: I suppose Mr. Hartley refers to me, since I have been in the peach business in Michigan for a number of years. I had an experience with spraying about ten years ago this spring. Before that I had been trying spraying a little with indifferent results. Our peaches in Michigan are subject to leaf curl to a considerable extent. That spring, ten years ago, I took a barrel of material and went over a row in a block of about 500 trees, which were four years old at the time. I used five pounds of lime and five pounds of blue vitriol; no Paris green at all. The trees looked blue when I was through with them and they K'ed blue all summer; and on this row we sprayed the trees were ply loaded with smooth, fine peaches. Question: What time was this spraying applied? rlr. Barker: Before the buds were open in the spring. We sprayed y in the spring, before the leaves were out, to prevent the curl of leaves. Mr. Harrison: Do you have any San Jose scale in Michigan? Mr. Barker: Yes, and plenty of it. They spray for that early in the spring before the buds swell. Mr. Harrison: Does the spraying there keep the scale down? Mr. Barker: Yes. They can fight it successfully. Mr. Marshall: We learned something along this line of spraying that has not been told you here, and that is about the grading of the apples. You can sort three bushels of the apples from sprayed trees to where you sort one bushel from the others. And that would be a difference of three or four cents per bushel in favor of the sprayed fruit. When the boys were working in the apples that were sprayed four times, they were happy, because they could see what they were doing. I think this is worth mentioning, and we fruit growers should consider it. The re - sults with us were very encouraging. This is one of the most important points when you come to the growing of fruit. Professor Emerson: In estimating the value of this spraying, there was one thing we did not take into consideration. And that was the expense of getting the fruit from the trees and ready to go into the barrels. This cost us about 10 cents per bushel, and most commercial orchardists could do the work better and cheaper than we did. The re - sults really look very good to us as they actually were </seg>
            <seg id="p086">86 tThe President: If there is no further discussion on this paper we 1 take up the next subject on the program, which Is "Some Breachy ces In Our Horticulture." by Mr. Williams. SOME BREACHY PLACES IN OUR HORTICULTTRK. L. O. WILLIAMS, UNIVER8ITY PLACE. Cong the recollections of my early boyhood days are the thoughts brush fences that I helped my father build around our first clear - i an 80-acre timber tract. This fence was composed largely of trees which were cut partly into at heights of from two to four feet from the ground. Where trees were lacking, the gaps would be filled up with brush taken from the adjacent clearings. These fences made a good, reasonable restraint for stock while they were new. but as the tree tops and brush settled to the earth, the cows would find their way over into forbidden fields. Such weak plares in these brush fences were des- Kas "breachy places." while the animal that was disposed to be ; for, or making, these breachy places was termed a breachy horse as the case might suit. These brush fences of my boyhood days, with which father used to protect his first plantings In the nursery or orchard, are very typical to my mind of many fences that are found today in the protection of our horticultural interests. Whether we style them brush fences, hedge Ees or wire fences there are evidently some very breachy places in our icultiiral fences. To point out a few of these breachy places Is my Mae in this paper. I wish first to call your attention to the lack of care in handling planting and cultivating trees. Nebraska has her "Arbor Day." which is calculated to inspire greater Interest in tree planting — and it has had a wonderful effect in spreading the gospel of tree planting throughout the state, more especially among the school children. When we look for the results from this boom of tree planting we are "at sea." We look in vain for the full fruition of our Arbor Day. The same vain search is repeated, to a large extent, among the orchards and groves that are planted by the large majority of our farmers. "What becomes of the trees that are planted?" This question was discussed several years ago In a paper by Prof. L. H. Bailey, and which was read before the American Association of Nurserymen. It was published at that time in the Western Fruit Grower and was the subject of much comment and some criticism. I do not remember all the im - portant statistics given by Professor Bailey, but if my memory serves me right he estimated that from all the fruit trees that left the nurseries of this country for the hands of the planters, there was hut one out of a hundred of them that arrived at the final stage of profitable fruition Tu«t think of the millions of tree* that gro out from our nursericf </seg>
            <seg id="p087">87 year, and then of the one per cent of them that fulfill the mission for which they were, or should have been, planted. We may well ask ourselves next, "Where are the ninety and nine? The responsibility for this loss must be shared by both the nurseryman and his agents, on the one hand, and by the tree planter on the other hand. I cannot enter into detail here as to all the factors which are at work in causing this great loss. In brief, it is due to a lack of care and thoughtful attention on the part of the tree planter, and a desire to "get rich quick" on the part of the nurserymen and tree agents. It certainly becomes M as tree planters to "mend our ways" in this matter. In addition to preaching the gospel of tree planting so strenuously, we as an association and as individual members thereof should both prac - tice and preach the working out of the salvation of our trees by eternal vigilance and care. A closely related "breach" to the one I have Just described may be designated as the "tree agents' graft." You all know enough of the tricks of the tree agents who infest nearly every community from year to year to realize that they are a fruitful source of disappointment and disgust on the part of the tree planter, and a common cause for failure with the trees that are planted. There are but few lines of business, that have any show of honor to them, in which there is so great a lack of moral principle shown as there is on the part of the average tree agent Such agents are like the breachy cow that is all the time making new breaches or widening the old ones in our brush fences. We are evidently in need of a bristling-barbed, tightly-stretched, six-wire fence wherewith to restrain these breachy agents. Our state laws require the doctors and druggists who prescribe and administer medicines for us to hold certificates showing a proper edu - cation and character entitling them to perform this service; why should we not require a similar certificate from our tree agents, dealers and nurserymen, showing that they have both education and character suited to prescribe and administer to the wants of the tree planters of this or any other state in our nation? Again, our state laws require that nurserymen shall show a certificate from their state entomologist to the effect that their stock is free from San Jose scales or other noxious insects. Did it ever occur to you that it is quite as important, if not more so, that the agents who sell the trees for these nurserymen should have a "certificate" showing that their eyes were not covered with scales to blind them to the sin of lying and avarice, and hat they were not infested with "leeches" wherewith they could suck the blood from their victims? Another breachy place is to be found in our lack of laws governing the size of fruit ana vegetable packages. Our pure food laws passed by the last legislature are very wholesome and healthful as applied to the most of our prepared food stuffs, and as to the weight and contents of all food packages. It occurs to me that our legislature should have </seg>
           
            <seg id="p088">88 Kluded in this bill the regulation of our fruit packages, and the con - ts of the same. For instance, our berry boxes as now found In the market consists of not less than half a dozen shapes and styles, and bow do we know but that they vary as much as to the size or capacity? I do know that a certain class of our fruit dealers or venders are guilty of using a small size berry box and taking advantage of the honest dealer by cutting the price of their berries. These "three for 25 cents" berries are often bought by these venders in the regular size boxes and then turned over into a small size box of the same shape as the other kly that it is a half inch shallower. The matter of size should be lated more properly by national laws, since we are so largely sup - plied by the berries and fruits from the Southern and Western states This same irregularity is noticeable with the baskets that hold the grapes, peaches, tomatoes, etc., on our markets. The grape basket of commerce contains supposedly from eight to ten pounds of grapes. If the customer could be guaranteed a uniform content of eight pounds net with each basket, there would be equal justice to all. The large splint basket used for tomatoes, crab apples, peaches, etc., varies In size more than the grape basket. Uniformity of size should be the rule, so that there would be no occasion for the buyer handling over a lot of peaches in order to pick Etbe biggest package. I see no reason why the net contents in pounds lid not be branded on each package in the same manner and for the e purpose that our manufacturers of prepared foods and bread stuffs are required to brand every package of goods sold by them. Going back to the tree planting topic again, I wish to call your attention to a breach in our present system and practice of planting the streets of our towns and cities to trees. The laws of our state and ordinances of our cities may make provision for planting the streets and highways with trees. There is, however, a notable lack of uni - formity in such planting, and so far as I can discern no adequate provision can be made to bring about a systematic and uniform system of planting. As a remedy for this breach in tree planting, I would advocate the control of street planting by the town or city, and its management to be vested in a park board, or a tree commissioner. This board or commissioner should have supervision of the planting of every tree upon our streets and highways. Instead of compelling each indi - vidual property owner to furnish his own trees, or relying on his own volunteer planting as is now the case, I would have this work supported by a special levy. The trees for city or town planting could then be l&gt;ought at wholesale, or provision be made for growing them in a city nursery. The entire care of the trees, including planting, watering, pruning and spraying should be in the hands of a competent commissioner E&gt; can devote his entire time to this work. Only by such a system management do I believe it possible to secure the proper planting desired results from street tree planting. </seg>

Not only is this irregular and mixed planting suffered, but all sorts and shapes of pruning are tolerated. Here is a low-down, scrubby boxelder. obstructing the view and passage for a lot or block, next may come the stately poplar, then the wavering, erratic elm tops may come in view. In pruning, our citizens have resorted to all kinds of tools and systems, fn their attempts to "line up" the boxelder, we find evidence of rude butchery. The trees are left with trunks all covered with scan and elbows at all angles. If there was ever a tree that should be out - lawed from a place on our streets, the boxelder should be the flrst one named. Ehis matter of street tree planting and care is too serious a one ly mind to be passed by lightly. It should receive not only the [deration of our horticultural societies, but be made the special set for study by our civic improvement leagues. Too many of the streets In our cities today remind me of the brush fences that I helped build forty years ago. We have made great advance along the general lines of horticulture, but we should set our faces and hands earnestly at work In repairing the breachy places in our horticulture. R President: I regret to announce that Mr. Bliss, who was to have next paper on our program, cannot be with us at this session, on of sickness.

Mr. Christy: I believe the committee should be reorganized I Mr. Swan: I think the committee is about right as It is. I move that be continued for another year. Motion seconded and carried. Report of the auditing committee was accepted and the committee discharged. Professor Emerson: There is a question that has come up that should be settled now, and that is in regard to the distinction between the Mam - moth Black Twig and the Arkansas Black. Some people know this apple as the Mammoth Black Twig and some as the Arkansas Black. It was named by the American Pomological Society and the name they gave to it is simply "Arkansas." This variety originated in Arkansas from seed planted there in 1833. It is what is commonly known as the Mammoth Black Twig, but some want to call it the Arkansas Black. The trees are somewhat similar in their habits of growth, but the fruit of the Mammoth Black Twig is very dark in color and the "Arkansas" is a reddish brown. The Arkansas is a smaller apple and darker in color than the Black Twig; it is of a dull dark color. The flesh of both varieties is yellowish. Elr. Brown: In the name Professor Emerson is correct, but the tree* tot resemble each other very much. The Mammoth Black Twig re - des the Winesap in habits of growth, while the Arkansas resembles growth of the Ben Davis, but different in color. There is still another e that is confused with these two varieties, and that is the Paragon. fruit growers in Colorado are planting the Paragon in preference to Arkansas Black. Professor Emerson: I do not believe we have one of the so-called Arkansas Black at the State Farm. Professor Beech mentions the Para son as the more desirable of the two. </seg>

Mr. Atkinson: In regard to the place of meeting for our next winter meeting. I think we should go out to the State Farm. I move that our meeting be held out at the State Farm next winter. Motion seconded and carried. Meeting adjourned to 2 p. m. The President: The meeting will now come to order. First on our program this afternoon is a paper on "Fruit Conditions in the Irrigation District," by E. F. Stephens, of Crete. FRUIT CONDITIONS IN THE IRRIGATION DISTRICT. E. F. STEPHENS, CRETE. The orchardist who attempts to grow fruit under irrigation in western Nebraska has at hand an excellent market for his product, at higher prices than can be obtained by eastern orchardists. The freight rates from the eastern counties of western Nebraska, or from the apple pro - ducing district of Colorado, are such as to give the producer of orchard fruits in western Nebraska a marked advantage. Apples in the David Hunter orchard at Sutherland In Lincoln county sold this fall for $1.65 per box or $5 a barrel, an increase of a dollar a barrel over the value of apples of the same quality in eastern Nebraska. We think that for many years to come the orchardist who grows fruit in the western half of the state may fairly expect to receive from 20 to 40 </seg>
            <seg id="p093">93 cents per bushel more for his fruit than the orchardist in our eastern counties. When the advantages of soil, climate and irrigation are fully utilized, western Nebraska should not only grow fruit for its own markets but should have a sufficient surplus of beautiful, highly colored fruit to market in less favored regions. The soil of western Nebraska is usually fertile and well suited to orcharding. Chemical analysis has shown that in many places soil in the semi-arid regions contains three times as much potash, six times as much magnesia and fourteen times as much lime as the average soil of the middle states. This is doubtless due to the fact t plant food has been stored for ages and has not been washed away »vy rainfall. Doubtless the high elevation, cold nights and sunny days of the semi - arid regions, coupled with the native fertility of the soil, explains the color and excellent quality of apples grown in Colorado, Idaho, Wash - ington, and Oregon. Western Nebraska has the elevation, the fertility of the soil and the climatic conditions suited to giving high color and ex - cellent quality to the apple. In extreme western Nebraska, near the Wyoming line, Ben Davis, Winesap, and Jonathan have suffered seriously from sunscald. Duchess. Whitney No. 20, Wealthy, Iowa Blush, Day and Northwestern Greening have proven hardy in tree and have fruited satisfactorily. To this lUt we may add Longfleld and Patton's Greening — equally hardy varieties which have been planted but have not yet come into bearing. In the eastern portion of irrigated Nebraska, in Lincoln and Damon counties, at a lower elevation, it has been found entirely practicable to add to the above list such varieties as Grimes' Golden, Utter's Red, Plum Cider, Jonathan, Ben Davis, Winesap, Missouri Pippin and Janet. Because of a very rapid evaporation incident to the elevation and arid conditions of western Nebraska, trees set fruit buds at a younger age than in eastern Nebraska. Elevation and rapid evaporation both act as a check on excessive growth and lead to the early formation of fruit buds. In one of our branch orchards, 318 miles west of Omaha, a single tree of Missouri Pippin gave a bushel and three pecks the fifth season after planting. In the Edward Scriven orchard near Mitchell, twenty miles from the Wyoming line, a Yellow Transparent tree gave one and one - half bushels of apples the fifth season after planting. In 1907, the trees having been planted eleven years, six rows In the David Hunter orchard, in Lincoln county, yielded eighteen hundred bushels of hand-picked apples, single trees eight and three-fourth bushels. The fruit sold for over $500 from single acres. The Scriven orchard near Mitchell commenced bearing at the age of four years and has been very profitable. Under irrigation an apple tree is able to support a full crop of fruit and also to set and develop strong fruit buds for the coming season. Sup - ported by irrigation they can bear each and every year instead of every other year as they are likely to do where depending on annual rainfall. </seg>
            <seg id="p094">94 I far western Nebraska, owing to the elevation, trees bloom much later n in the eastern counties. Since our orchards came into bearing in Saline county we have found the major portion of our market in western and northwestern Nebraska Freight rates on apples are very heavy. It therefore seemed to us that the best way to eliminate freight charges on fruit was to plant orchards in central and western Nebraska and grow a supply for the local markets. With this thought in view we have planted fifty thousand trees in branch orchards, with the result that fruit produced therein is marketed com paratively free from freight charges. Apples thus grown bring from 25 to 40 cents a bushel more than fruit grown in eastern Nebraska. The freight on apples in car-load lots from Crete to Torrington, Wyoming, ten miles beyond the Nebraska line, is 37} cents a bushel. The local freight on smaller shipments would, of course, be very much greater. Compare this with the freight rate of 24 cents a bushel on apples New York state to Omaha. Plums are grown with much greater certainty than in eastern Ne - braska. Apparently the proper fertilization of the blossoms requires dry sunny weather during the blooming season. Western Nebraska is far more likely to have weather of this character, therefore the plum orchards of this section are far more productive. Varieties of plums so far fruited are Sandoz, Forest Garden, De Soto. Wolf, Hawkeye, Lombard and German Prune. All these varieties yield successfully from North Platte to Mitchell, twenty miles east of the Wyoming line. The soil and climate of western Nebraska seems to be peculiarly suited to the growth of cherry trees. Cherries so far tested and proven hardy are the Early Richmond, Large Montmorency and English Morillo. The Ostheim has been successfully grown, but is less productive than the Peaches can be grown 150 miles farther west and at a higher elevation than Lincoln county. In the Hunter orchard at Sutherland two bushels have been grown on single trees. E liven a fertile soil, plenty of water, a favorable climate and good Sets, it seems to me a greater effort should be made to utilize the [cultural advantages of western Nebraska. The President: Next on our program is a paper by Dr. Bessey on "The Physiology of Pruning." THE PHYSIOLOGY OF PRUNING. CHARLES E. BESSEY, UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA In the first place it must be remembered that pruning is a dangerous surgical operation. A tree is a living thing, and when any part of its living structure is removed it Is very much like the removal of a living part of the human body. In fact I have come to the point where ordinary </seg>
            <seg id="p095">95 pruning of the tree reminds me of an operation performed on the human body for something like appendicitis. It may be a necessary thing In either rase, but there is always danger connected with it. As a plant physiologist, I must Insist upon this view as contrasted with the view that some people have that it is a wholly beneficial thing to remove cer - tain parts of the tree. In discussing this matter of pruning, I may make It somewhat plainer by taking up the reasons which are given for pruning by different people Tbev mav be Indicated as follows: 1 It is sometimes said that we must prune a tree to save It from dying when we transplant It. Accordingly It is a common practice to cut away more or less of the top of the tree when transplanting it. Now this pruning of the top is an unnecessary thing if the transplanting is done at the right time. This right time is when the buds are still dormant, and furthermore when the weather Is not dry. The transplanting of the tree is. of course, a serious thing for It. Its roots have been more or less cut off and it does not have access to the water In the soil as It had before transplanting. So we must be careful In this operation to give the tree every advantage and not to move the tree unless these ad - vantages are present. I may say further that pruning 1- less necessary also at the time of transplanting if this work is done in the right manner If the roots are not at all mutilated and the ground Is not disturbed, there Is absolutely no need of top pruning. However, under ordinary condi - tions the roots will be somewhat mutilated and the ground will be dis - turbed, so that in practice there will be some Injury to the roots. It should be the aim of every man who transplants a tree to see that the tree Is not made to suffer the loss of more roots than Is absolutely ■neces - sary. The too common practice of taking up the tree with the least effort on the part of the man who does the work so that the roots are not more than a few Inches in length is entirely wrong. L«st spring T saw some very pood Carolina poplars which had been tak«i up with roots scarcely more than six Inches long, and the wretch who planted them dug little holes about eight Inches deep and scarcely more than a foot in diameter In these he crowded the poor mutilated roots, and thought he was actually giving the trees a chance to live. That they did live In spite of this treat- Kt merely Indicates that this particular tree will stand almost iiny of abuse at the hands of Ignorant and lazy men P Pruning is said to be desirable and necessary to bring the head of :ree up to the desired height This, however. Is only necessary when early treatment of the tree has not beem right If the tree when young has had the buds nibbed off there will not be side branches to be taken away, when they have attained considerable size. The rubbing off of the bud gives a very little wound and the wound, such as It is. Is In a very soft tissue which very easllv and qulcklv heals over. Pruning for ... ... . this purpose, that Is for proper heading up. should be done early, in the </seg>
            <seg id="p096">96 manner I have suggested, or at latest in the nursery row when the branches are still small. 3 We often hear it said that trees must be pruned so as to give the top the right shape either as to height or width. I grant that this is occa - sionally the case, although I wish to say in this connection that most trees if started right will take the form of beauty that we desire with little later pruning. Whatever is done in this way for giving shape to the tree must be done early, for it is hopeless to wait until the tree has attained a different shape and then expect to give it good shape by later pruning. It is like allowing a child to acquire bad habits and then ex - pect to correct these habits by a later series of punishments. Much better would it be for child and parent to have the correction made when the first tendency to the bad habit appears. 4. Now and then it is necessary to prune in order to limit the amount of fruit produced by trees and shrubs. This, however, does not involve the production of large wounds and I need make no criticism here. There is rarely any abuse of the pruning habit under this head. 5. We prune now and then tn order to remove old and non-bearing stalks. This again calls for no particular discussion, since pruning of this kind is almost always done by people who understand the matter in hand. 6. It is one of the common remarks that many trees must be pruned in order to make the interior of the tree more accessible. It is true that a tree may have so many small branches in its interior portion that one finds great difficulty in scrambling up into the tree, and therefore pruning must be resorted to. Here all I need say is that it is very much better to do this early. When these little shoots sprout out here and there they may be removed very easily by a big knife or a pair of prun - ing shears. There is no sense, physiologically speaking, in waiting until these have made such growth that considerable wounds are made when the interior branches are removed. Pie of the most common reasons for pruning that I have heard is in the light." Now this is largely a fallacy. There are some i where perhaps more light is needed in the interior of the tree, the climate of the prairies and the plains this is generally not true. The light which is needed is necessary for the leaves, and the leaves of most of our trees are at the outside of the tree top. I doubt very much the validity of the argument for severe pruning which is based upon the theory that the interior of the tree needs lighting up. The tree will generally take care of this matter itself unless the trees are crowded too closely together, as in some orchards. In fact I am quite of the opinion that as often as otherwise the increase in light may be harmful to the interior of the tree in such a climate as that of Nebraska. k8. Along with the foregoing is- also given this reason, "to let in the ." This again is very largely a fallacy. In this climate there is always enough, as we are all aware. The wind blows almost constantly, and </seg>
            <seg id="p097">97 there is scarcely a day In the summer when a breeze is not blowing through the tree-tops. Instead of its being necessary to let in the air. very commonly the increase of air in the shape of increased velocity of wind is harmful. We have been in the business of growing windbreaks for a long time in Nebraska, and we have all learned that many trees and other plants grow much better when the winds are kept away. This is quite true of our trees as well as the smaller plants. So I am quite of the opinion as a plant physiologist that the tree planter's excuse for much cutting out of the top, when he says that he wishes "to let in the air." is fallacious. 9. Much pruning is done because people think it is the right thing to do. We were taught in our youth that one of the things to do to the tree is to prune, and so throughout our lives we go at the trees to cut them back here and there. It is a good deal as it used to be with the old-time schoolmaster, who had a theory that boys ought to be punished rather frequently — that any punishment given to the boy was deserved, for if he had not yet done anything wrong, he certainly would do so very soon, and so the punishment was justified. Many people seem to have the same thought with regard to the pruning of trees. This desire to prune, to clip, and cut and slash the tree has no more real foundation in plant physiology than th? annual raking of lawns in the fall and spring has to do with the keeping of the ground in good condition. I have had a good deal of difficulty In convincing people who really should know better that the raking of the leaves from the lawns is a wasteful and harmful pro - cess. They were brought up that way and they think that the lawn that is not raked — that does not have Its leaves all taken off in the fall, has an unkempt look, and so they rake off the rich fertilizing material that would have given nourishment to the grass in the spring as well as pro - tection in the winter. They do it because they have always done It. and so a great many people prune their trees from time to time because they think it is the right thing to do without hating a good basis for their conclusion. Mostly pruning is unnecessary, and when necessary It should be done with the greatest care and with the greatest thought. 10. There are some people who think the tree likes to be pruned, and that it grows better after it ha3 been pruned — that it stimulate* the tree to help itself. Such people forget that the tree is a living thing. I some - times think that trees feel as well as live. I know that they are living, and I believe sometimes that they feel. They certainly when overpnined — when injured grievously — show results which are very much like those shown by the man who has been grievously treated at the hands of some bungling surgeon. Looking over the matter from beginning to end, I may close by saying that trees, like children, need correction now and then, but the correction should be given early — should be given when it will result in good without too great bodily injury. If a tree shows a tendency to grow in the wrong </seg>
            <seg id="p098">98 direction, that tendency should be checked early and not permitted to con - tinue until a great branch has to be removed, leaving a great wound through which disease is certain to enter and so shorten the life of Finally, let us all as tree lovers make a strong stand ngainst the "tree butchers" who remove enormous branches from our beautiful trees under the guise of pruning. Such work does not deserve the n.inip of pruning. It should be called butchery, and such men who come to our grounds asking us to employ them to mutilate our trees should be driven away and not permitted to touch these living things that have grown up under our care. Let us care for our trees when they are young, let us care for them as they grow, but let us not neglect them and then try to make the correction by a mutilation which comes quite too late DISCUSSION. Mr Beltzer: I would like to have Dr. Bessey state what, in his opin Ion. Is the best time for us to prune our fruit trees. Dr. Bessey: I purposely left that question open. There are many different views on this question of pruning fruit trees, but it should be done so as to not allow the wound to remain open too long at a time. And that would naturally bring the time for pruning fruit trees toward spring. Mr. Beltzer: This is really the first good paper I have ever heard on the subject of pruning. And on this question of removing large limbs from trees, there Is no question at all but what it Is a detriment to the trees. In moving large trees from one place to another the larsre roots El always be cut first and then the trees can be moved successfully very detrimental to trees a few years old to move them without g off the large limbs and roots. Mr. Stephens: If I were going to set out a commercial orchard today I would rather get a good "one-year-old tree than to pay extra for trees two or three years old that would necessitate transplanting I believe It is to our Interest to tell the people what Is the best thing to plant — at the. proper time and also the proper size. I Viave some apple trees left Just as they were growing In the nursery row. and you can not get a better tree than some of these are. The reason Is that they have never been moved from where they were originally The time to trim a tree of any kind is early in the spring. Professor Card: The matter of cllmatp comes in here In this pruning nuestion In the eastern climate people are advised to prune their treps all the winter through. In Nebraska I would advise just thP opposite of this. The eastern climate necessitates pruning heavily in order to let In the sunlight, while here In Nebraska you do not have that question to contend with Here pruning is done in order to get Into the tree to work ■ word I would like to add for the reason for pruning, and that is. Improvement upon nature By pruning we aid nature in keeplns </seg>
            <seg id="p099">99 Kiroperly shaped tree. And in this connection there is one question that fast coming up and that really* relates to the physiology of pruning. 1 that is, pruning in the winter for wood and in the summer for fruit. E Bessey: As to that question of pruning in the winter for wood and summer for fruit, I really don't see how that applies. I do not that there is anything in the physiology of the tree that would any difference in that regard. I do not see that there is any ogical reason for it at all. Er. Secor: I believe, Dr. Bessey, that if you would take a shotgun to so-called "tree butcher" you speak of, you would be doing the cause uning much good. Dr. Bessey: I think we should create a sentiment against such prac - that these men can not put down. I don't know what to do, but that shotgun method might be the most effective. Mr. Harrison: If a man has a tree on the outside of his walk, it is his just as much as one on the inside, and he should protect them both. In Nebraska if a man injures a tree in front of your house he does so at Mr. Stephens: In this question of pruning fruit trees, you will find that if you trim in June, you will have less water sprouts than if yon trim in the winter. I think most of the trimming done in commercial orchards is done in the winter because that is the most convenient time to do it. This, of course, results in many water sprouts the coming year. Another point in connection with pruning. This was noticeable some years ago when the society met at Nebraska City, and we went out to see .1. Sterling Morton's place, and we found many large limbs and trees in his orchard which were badly sun-scalded. A person should be careful to kcr]) the trees and larger limbs well clothed with leaves. E Member: I have had considerable experience in pruning, and I find pruning in June will bring less water sprouts than pruning in t any other time ot the year. There is a vast difference in trees, however. In apples you take the White Winter Permain, Duchess, and Cooper's Early White, and these will need no trimming at all. But when Winesap and others like that, I think it would be very you con: difficult to raise good fruit and allow these trees to run just about as they felt like. I think it is out of the question to get good fruit with some varieties without pruning at the right time and in the right way. And especially is this so with some varieties. The best varieties we have, such as the Winesap. Ben Davis, Jonathan, Janet, etc., all need pruning more or less in order to keep them in good shape. E. Davidson: My attention has been called to the work of some of lephone men in Aurora. The men have been climbing some of the there with their climbers on, and I believe it is going to be rery &gt;n these trees. If it does not kill the trees, this practice will cer - do them a great injury. Mr Harrison: In Minneapolis three very beautiful trees were killed </seg>
            <seg id="p100">100 in this way. The matter was taken up with the proper authorities and the men were compelled to pay $100 apiece for these trees that were killed. Mr. Snodgrass: I was very glad to hear Dr. Bessey refer to this "tree butcher," as he called him. The telephone men who make a practice of cutting right and left among trees have no more right to cut the limbs off your trees than they have to cut one of your own limbs off. The Nebraska laws are all right on this, and they should be enforced on every occasion where the practice is noticed. I would like to call attention especially to what Dr. Bessey said in regard to cutting a limb off early. Head the tree up by rubbing off the buds early and thus do away with much unnecessary cutting. When a tree is pruned it should be pruned right. IMr. Yager: In regard to this girdling proposition, I would not like to ve the impression go out that it is a practice that should be encour - aged. I think we ought to guard against such methods as that of trying to bring a tree into bearing. I don't see but what it kills a tree a little Kker than it would otherwise die. It is not a right idea. You are )ly trying to do something directly against the laws of nature. Mr. Spencer: I am not very much in favor of this girdling proposition. I have taken trees that would not blossom, and by girdling make them blossom, but I have not been able to make them bear by this method. If a person does any girdling it should be done in the season of greatest growth, from about the first to the tenth of June. Now as to pruning; a Duchess tree, for instance, would not require much pruning. But I would not want a Winesap tree that I did not prune. All the pruning on any tree should not be done in one year, but do some of it every year. It is usually just the little limbs that need to come off. You must be gov - erned by the nature of the tree, for some need more pruning than others. Mr. Pollard: I think Dr. Bessey has given us the most practical, com - mon-sense paper we have ever had. But there is one thing about this trimming business, and I see it every time I come to Lincoln, and that is the way your street trees are butchered up. There should be some system to your trimming of shade and street trees. They should be trimmed so as to not shut off the view from the inside. In New England the street trees are ideal in this regard. The President: If there is no more discussion of this subject, we will take up the next subject on our program. tMr. Swan: I move, Mr. Chairman, that we send a delegate to the ithweet Iowa, Iowa State, Kansas, and Missouri Horticultural society stings, and pay their expenses. Mr. Russell: The society has for a number of years always allowed $10 toward the expenses of delegates to other societies. tlr. Swan's motion was seconded and carried with the amendment that customary $10 be allowed toward the expenses of delegates to other iti«. Meeting adjourned </seg>
            <seg id="p101">101 Thubsdat, January 23, 9:00 A. M E President: Before we take up the regular program this morning, to appoint an Obituary Committee. I will appoint on this corn- Mr. Harrison and Mr. Youngers. ■ first subject on our program for this session is that of "Flowers." Green, of Fremont. FLOWERS. H. GREEN, FREMONT In selecting the subject which I have the privilege of presenting to you this afternoon, I purposely chose one which would give me the oppor - tunity to ramble around among the flowers about as I pleased. The branch of horticulture which I represent on this program is so different from that followed by the majority of the members of this particular society, that a florist is at somewhat of a disadvantage for the reason that the methods of cultivation which he uses under the glass are decidedly not those he could recommend for the home garden. Neither kthe varieties that do the best in the greenhouse always the ones that give you the best results outside. Ps more particularly alludes to the ones that are grown where cut as are wanted. The roses, for Instance, from which we cut the blossoms in large numbers all through autumn, winter, and the spring months, are decidedly not the sorts that it would be best for you to plant in your garden. Nor would you have even a fair chance with them in the window of your home during the indoor flower months. And the same is true of the highly bred carnations that are grown by the million by the florists of the country. And the violets. There are, however, a number of different things that the florist grows for cut flowers that can be grown, and often with as good success in the home window. Of these the Dutch bulbs are perhaps the easiest of all. You can produce as good tulips, daffodils, and hyacinths at home as any florist can. Procure good bulbs, of a reliable dealer, follow his instructions, and success is assured. The industry of commercial flower growing is rapidly increasing and has at the present time reached the point where more than 75 millions of square feet of glass are required to cover the greenhouses of the United States, and the total value of these properties is about sixty million dollars. Located near the large wholesale flower markets are specialists, who devote their entire establishments to the growing of one variety of flowers. The average florist doing business in the smaller cities and towns is obliged, of course, to grow a general line of cut flowers to meet the demands of his trade. He also grows bedding plants, decorative stock and usually handles flower and vegetable seeds. I sometimes think that the same amount of energy and hard work required to run a retail </seg>
            <seg id="p102">102 NUB ASK A STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY florist establishment, applied with the same amount of good Judgment to any other business, would pay bigger dividends But there Is a fascina - tion about the growing of flowers that so takes hold of one that he would rather work along among his beloved plants that be cooped up In a stuffy office or business house for several times the financial returns. Nor is his pleasure entirely selfish, for he knows that the blossoms that he has watched over and tended so carefully will go forth either to bring pleasure, or as a token of love and sympathy to some one. One morning a physician called at my place for a box of flowers, and while they were being put up he told me that be was going to take them to a patient of his — a little girl. And he said, "They will do her more good than any medicine she could take." And he is a pretty wise old doctor, too. Just to illustrate what may be accomplished with even a single flower, the story is told of a young man who had called regularly at the home of a very nice young lady for a long time, but owing to his bashfulness was unable to express his feelings as he wanted to. One evening he appeared wearing in his buttonhole a beautiful rose, which seemed so desirable to the young lady that she remarked that she would be willing to give anyone a kiss for a rose like that. Before the astonished young man hardly realized what had happened the bargain was concluded, and she was the happy possessor of the rose. He determinedly reached for his hat and started for the door. "Why, where are you going, George?" she asked. "Down to the florist's to get four dozen more roses," he replied. The invitations are out During the summer months the florist is obliged to replant his houses with young plants, for but few of the different things grown are kept over for the second season. The soil in which they have been grown must also be removed, necessary repairs made, and the beds or benches refilled with fresh soil — the best that can be obtained. While this is being done we must have a supply of flowers to offer, for while the demand is not usually large at this season, they are usually wanted in considerable quantities, occasionally This demand must be supplied with stock that can bo grown out of doors at least a part of the season. Just what these flowers will be, depends to some extent on what this particular trade will demand, according to the grower's judgment For summer flowers out of doors, at our place we have an abundance of asters in all their colors, daisies, gladiolus, dahlias, sweet peas, achilla, astelba or spina, Japonica lilies, aura roseum and album, and for roses, Crimson Rambler. All these things are selected for the abundance of the bloom that they furnish, their good quality and the ease with which they are handled. While they all require care and some knowledge of their requirements is necessary in order that they may receive proper treatment, there is nothing needed that cannot be given as well by the amateur flower lover as by the best equipped florist. With a little work and a little planning there is no good reason why anyone cannot have an abundance of flowers all summer long from the home garden </seg>

He paints on the gates of the morning those dissolving tints which vanish Into light At evening, moving mountains of earth's choicest gems in their mingled beauty escort the retiring day. How glorious the night when the great dome, frescoed with blue.

What august sublimity crowns the mountain E coronal of white upon the hoary brow, the play of shadow and the blue above where float the fleecy clouds, all give us inspiration you let God alone and do not mar His works, what a beautiful land He gives us. Before the white man touched our shores. He spread out before us a panorama of resplendent loveliness. There were vast forests of majestic trees, great rivers fed by unfailing streams were flowing to the sea. sparkling brooks were dancing gaily in the sunlight, charming lakes fringed with verdure and flowers were flashing their beauty like diamonds on the bosom of the fair mother earth, stretching out to the distant horizons were vast prairies whose emerald green melted Into the sapphire of the sky, and there were flowers, flowers everywhere. God loved them so He filled the world with them all the way from the sunny tropics to the vast tundras of the Arctic. He makes winter glorious. In the cold North, at evening time, there Is the most gorgeous display of which we can have any conception, when the curtains of the Aurora Borealls. flashing as with the coloring of the most sparkling gems, burn and glow, vanish and come again, lighting up all the clear heavens with entrancing splendors as If great moving pictures from the very heavens were con - trolled by the unseen hands of angels. When it comes to fruits, God might have given them the somber color of the cobble stones — but no. One of the finest pictures on earth Is the orchard in autumn with Its great luscious burdens wrapped up In envelopes of red and gold. The cherry tree Is made beautlfnl — a bouquet of white In early spring and later you see the mingling of the red with the green — one of nature's fairest pictures. The strawberry — God's climax — Is more valuable because of Its superlative beauty. Fruits are not ready for delivery until they have their wrappings done up in color - ings no artist can reproduce.

One hundred and fifty kinds of lilacs, with the power to produce more till we may run them into the thousands. These stretch the time of blooming from early spring till the first of July In the West, we have not the full assortment of shrubs for our trying climate which they have in the moister and milder climate of the East, and yet. we have the power and skill for producing more. Our own "Wizard of the North," Professor Hansen, has brought out of the unknown, a cross of Primus pissardi and Besseyii, one of the most beauti - ful shrubs I ever saw, symmetrical in form, with foliage of deepest crimson purple. Back in the unknown land there are other forms of loveliness which we trust his skill will drag forth to light. The charming family of the Philadelphas or syringas is a numerous one, and new types are being constantly added; so with the splreas; and there are the viburnums and other shrubs which are all the while being improved. When we come to flowers, we are in a land filled with the very fasci - nations and astonishments of loveliness. The rose, the peony, the phlox, the canna, and the dahlia, with hosts of perennials, show the love of the beautiful on the part of the Creator. But this is not all; the native flowers are but the beginning of things. They are mostly single. He Rives man the skill to make them double and to increase their beauty many fold. There is kindly nature, daughter of God. Her head white with the snows of the milleniums. and yet, on her tresses are the glint - ings of the sunlight of eternal youth with each recurrent spring time. She is ever ol&lt;l and ever young, and yet, into the inner temple of her Holy of Holies, she permits us to go where she opens before us new pages of mystery and permits us to work miracles with her. What stupendous changes have been made with the phlox, the peony, the dahlia, and carna - tion, so marked, so divergent from the parent source their own mother would not know them. Yes, back in that unknown are reserves of beaut? rnan eye hath not yet Been, waiting to be revealed so that the thine* have already seen are only prophetic of further revelation. Such men as Burbank.

The world's unused capital of the useful and beautiful is something stupendous. Providence stands at the door and knocks.

I need not tell jou of the beauty and of the grandeur beyond where the furrows in the fields of azure are blazing with stars in the limitless flower gardens of God. The brightest gems of earth are only the alphabet with which we read the splendors of the garments of the suns. Yonder the milky way and the glowing constellations are God's infinite prairies, planted with stupendous blooms which are immortelles. We are living in the margin of all that splendor and this borderland which touches it should have some forecasting of the glory to be revealed, so take what is yours — the wealth of the forest, the tree, the shrub, and the flower and fruit. Man's stinginess and narrowness are insults to the Divine bounty. He builds a mansion or simply a comfortable dwelling and fills it with costly furniture, but when he goes into "God's great out of doors" a wave of poverty strikes and almost paralyzes him A ten cent flower or twenty - five cent tree is all he can afford. Think of putting a $3,000 picture in a fifty cent frame. The moment he moves into his house and occupies his furniture, both begin to depreciate and soon become second-hand goods, but let him fill that yard with the most delightful trees, shrubs, and flowers which money can buy; let him plant in masses as God does, and the moment they leave his hands they begin to increase in value. We reiterate, "Beauty is wealth," so raise plenty of it and glorify the home. Do some home missionary work for yourself in the evangel of beauty. You need it badly enough. Do something for your neighbors. You can let people know you passed this way. A single farm, put to its best, would be a Mecca for pilgrims in search of the beautiful. A whole section of rich prairie would be like a section of paradise let down to earth. A whole township improved as it might be, would make earth so attractive that the best Christian would be willing to stay out of heaven awhile to enjoy it. Such surroundings would lengthen life and prolong a stay on earth. Home would be • delightful memory*to children in after years. If a man wanted a vaca - tion, he could go over to the next section and lose himself in the delights of an earthly elysium. Such improvements would lift man out of the hog and hominy range into a higher life. Cattle, horses, hogs, corn, and wheat are all right In themselves. They have given you competence so you can now fix up and you will find there are other things fully as attractive and beautiful as the hog, and yet, what farmer gives that front yard as much attention as he does his pig pen? </seg>
            <seg id="p106">106 DISCUSSION Elr Meek: 1 am glad that this society took action to have the next ting out at the State Farm, for we can then get the students more ctly interested in these lines of flowers and ornamentals. Every student out at the State Farm should have been able to hear these two excellent papers on "Flowers" and "Ornamentals" this morning. They need ideas like these for their farm homes. You can go out through all this good farming country of ours and on land that is worth $100 an acre you will probably see ten cents' worth of flowers or shrubs. If these young men who are now studying at the State Farm could see and hear and know about such things they would become more interested, and it would mean a great improvement in the general apearance of the farm homes. I think the country papers should also take up this matter and continue to keep it before the people. hMr. Pollard: I am very much interested in this subject of beautifying m homes. I have been meeting with this society for a good many years, and I have enjoyed the meetings more and more each year. But what are we doing to extend the interest and work of this society? As 1 look over the room now and note the members of our society, I see that they are nearly all old men. I don't think that we are doing as much as we can in the way of extending the work of horticulture. We must get the younger set interested — we must spread out more, for now we have no one to turn the work over to when we are gone. We must get the young men from the farms interested, and show them that actual results can be accomplished. The city folks are alive to this subject of home adornment, but the farmers are not. I think we could profitably do some good work in the farmers' institutes, something similar to what the University and State Farm people are doing. I believe that institute Kis doing more good among the farmers than any other kind of . The farmers become interested and go home filled up with new which will bring results. I would like to see the institute managers take up this question of home adornment; they should get some goo.l man to go on the programs and preach this doctrine. Mr. Marshall: It seems to me that right now would be a good time to make a little explanation about the working of our society, and its inten - tions, system of membership, etc. It does seem to me that we should have more members, and, as has been suggested, we certainly should get Ee more young men interested in our work. Not^that we don't want more old members, for we do, but we want to get some younger men rested in the society and its work so that we can have some one to turn this work over to at the proper time. Our system of membership is $5 for a life membership and $1 for an annual membership. Any one who is a member receives all the regular bulletins of the society and the annual report free of charge. Life members are all entitled to vote and hold any office in the society to which they may be elected. Annual members are entitled to all bulletins and reports and discussion in the </seg>
            <seg id="p107">107 meetings, but are not eligible to voting or holding office in the society. If a person cannot afford to become a life member now, it would be a good plan to join for a year, and then later, if he likes it all right, become a life member. Mr. Swan: Why wouldn't it be a good idea to organize a ladies" auxiliary in connection with our society. If we could get something like this it would be another step along the right line. Say start it in now with a life membership fee of $1, and later, if it seemed necessary, that could be changed. It does not seem to me that we have the ladies inter - ested or as well represented in our meetings as they should be. Mr Harrison: A society with a ladies' auxiliary is a very fine thing. At Minnesota, where they have such an organization, they give a whole day over to the ladies to have a program, and it is a great success. A society of this kind is very satisfactory. The President: The next subject on our program this morning is 'The Relation of Fertilizers to Fruit Growing," by Prof. F. W. Card, of Sylvania, Pa. THE RELATION OF FERTILIZERS TO FRUIT-GROWING. FRED W. CARD, 8YI.VANIA, PA Why are fertilizers used? The first and most important reason is to supply plant food. A number of elements are needed in this food, but fortunately most soils contain enough of nearly all of them. Only nitro - gen, phosphoric acid, potash, and rarely lime or magnesia, are likely to be deficient. Lime is far more often needed to correct acidity of the soil or to improve its mechanical condition than to supply plant food. k Plant food, important as it is, represents only one of the factors of fertility, and perhaps not even the most important one under average conditions. There are at least four factors which must rank of primary importance. These are texture, moisture, plant food, and living organisms. incidental losses of plant food may at times be very great At the inesota Experiment Station a plot of ground kept in wheat for four consecutive years lost nearly six hundred pounds of nitrogen in addition to that directly used by the crop. Such losses are greatest where land is continuously plowed and allowed to remain bare during a large part of the year. The introduction of clover one year in the rotation, not only prevented the loss but left more nitrogen in the soil at the end of the four years than it contained at the beginning. In fruit growing such losses are guarded against by the use of cover-crops, which shall keep the ground from lying tare during the winter. Fertilizers, or at least chemicals, are sometimes used to produce some chemical effect, or bring about some physical action in the Boil. This is true of lime or gypsum. Lime is used to correct an acid condition, to improve th« mechanical condition of a stiff clay, or perhaps to hasten the </seg>
            <seg id="p108">108 decay of vegetable matter where it may be in excess. The office of gypsum is to set free plant food already in the soil. fm Relation of Fertilizers to Yield. The primary object of fertilizing increase yield. What, then is to be expected in this line? There is doubt that in the growing of small fruits, liberal fertilizing, either stable manure or chemicals, is essential to the best yields. This is particularly true of the strawberry. Currants, gooseberries, and black raspberries also respond well to the use of stable manure. Blackberries and red raspberries, on rich ground, may make too rank growth if manured heavily, with the result of increased loss from winter-killing. With orchard fruits an increase in yield from the application of fertil - izers is not so certain. A long series of experiments in New York, begin ning with an orchard some fifty years planted, growing on average New York soil, showed that the application of phosphoric add and potash increased the yield only slightly more than enough to repay the coat of the fertilizer. Results in Massachusetts, on the contrary, have shown a decided increase in yield of apples from the use of stable manure, and also from a combination of ground bone and sulfate of potash-magnesia. Five plots were included in these experiments, the land being treated at the following rates per acre each year: Plot 1. Barnyard manure, 10 tons Plot 2. Wood ashes. 1 ton. Plot 3. No fertilizer. Plot 4. Ground bone, 600 pounds. Muriate of potash, 200 lbs. Plot 5. Ground bone, 600 pounds. Sulfate of potash-magnesia, 400 pounds Each plot contains twelve trees, three each of Gravenstein. Baldwin. Roxbury Russet and Rhode Island Greening. The manuring began in 1889, but the trees were planted in 1890. The land was cropped until 1894, when it was seeded to grass and two crops of hay removed each year thereafter until 1903, when the second crop was cut and allowed to remain on the ground. Since that time all the grass produced has been allowed to remain on the ground, being cut twice each year The total yield of apples to date has been as follows Plot 1. 16,637 pounds Plot 2. 9,317 pounds. Plot 3. 2,912 pounds. Plot 4. 9,906 pounds. Plot 5. 15,005 pounds. Director Brooks writes that the apples produced on Plot 2 (wood ashes) have averaged highest in color and flavor. The Baldwin crop one rear was pronounced by a good Judge worth $1.00 per barrel more than those grown with (table manure Next in color and general quality has </seg>
            <seg id="p109">109 been the fruit grown on Plot 5, though the difference between this and that on Plot 4 has not been marked. Fruit from the plot fertilized with stable manure is large, but of relatively poor texture and low color. The average diameter of the trees is greatest where stable manure was used, while those treated with ground bone and sulfate of potash-mag - neeia rank next in size. t There can be little doubt that under- many conditions the addition of rtilizer will yield profitable returns with orchard fruits, but in soils yet so fertile as those of Nebraska their use should only be advised when careful tests have shown their value. Stable manure is likely to be a more economical source of plant food than chemicals, even then. I The Relation of Fertilizers to Color of Fruit. It is often claimed that ash gives high color to fruit. In the New York experiments above ;rred to this matter wa3 carefully watched. In very unfavorable years the fertilized fruit appeared to possess slightly better color, but in most seasons no difference could be detected, and in some cases those without fertilizers were even better. In Massachusetts, however, the use of wood ashes did have a noticeable effect on colors, the portion so treated giving very much higher colored fruit. Soil, climate, sunlight and method of culture play a more important part in this problem as a rule than do the fertilisers used. Apples grown in sod are higher colored than those grown under cultivation. An excess of nitrogen, which may come from a continuous use of clover cover crops and thorough cultivation, may give fruit poor in color. fThe Relation of Fertilizers to Flavor. — Experiments have shown that e application of potash will increase the amount of sugar in fruits under some conditions. An excess of nitrogen tends to reduce flavor. Here again, climate, soil, and sunlight probably play a more important part than fertilizers. Relation of Fertilizers to Keeping Quality. — I know of no definite in - formation with reference to this problem. Beyond the fact that an excess of nitrogen tends to produce a less perfectly developed fruit, which may not keep as well, little can be said. Even this much is more supposition than established fact. Relation of Fertilizers to Firmness and Shipping Quality. — It has been suggested, and is believed by some, that potash, in the form of sulfate. will give firmer fruit, particularly in the strawberry, than if applied as muriate. One test of this question made under my observation failed to show any material difference. Experience has taught me. however, that heavy applications of nitrogen give fruit which is very soft, is lacking in color, and rots badly upon the vines. This is due, in part at least, to the rank growth of leaves and the greater amount of shade thus induced. The Residual Effects of Fertilizers. — It is often believed that com - mercial fertilizers act chiefly as a stimulant, and leave the land poorer than before This is a mistaken idea Real fertilizers furnish plant-food </seg>
            <seg id="p110">I Just the same sense that stable manure does. Lime and gypsum nd plaster) are not true fertilizers and do act as stimulants. Betting ; some plant-food already in the soil. There are several reasons for this prevailing impression, for the after-effects of chemicals are sometimes bad. If an incomplete fertilizer is used the crop may bo on robbing the soil of the elements which this lacks. A commoner source of trouble comes from the neglect to add humus to the soil. Land continuously plowed, with nothing but chem - icals added, may be kept rich in plant-food but It loses its vegetable matter; its mechaniral condition becomes bad, and good results cannot he had. Some chemical fertilizers, notably sulfate of ammonia and acid phos - phate, also known as superphosphate, leave an acid residue in the soil and If used continuously in large quantities may make the soil so sour that many kinds of plants, such as clover, alfalfa, beets, and others, will not thrive in it. Such fertilizers should lie avoided in large quan - tities, or lime should be applied to correct the acidity. The Source of Plant Food.— All the elements of plant-food are sup - plied in stable-manure, and this should be the first source from which to look for them. If necessary to go beyond this, nitrogen may be had in the form of nitrate of soda, sulfate of ammonia, dried blood, or tankage. Bone preparations also contain some nitrogen. Of these forms, nitrate of soda is the most quickly available and should only be used in small quantities and just at the time when plants are ready to take it up quickly. Frequent, light applications, rather than heavy applications at one time, should be the rule with this material. Dried blood and tankage are excellent sources from which to secure more slowly available nitrogen For the orchardist, and even for the bush-fruit grower, the most economical way in which to get this most expensive of all elements of plant-food is by the use of leguminous cover-crops. All plants of the clover family can draw upon the air for nitrogen, and the orchardist can generally get all the nitrogen his trees need by this means alone. I have found equally good results from the use of a clover cover-crop among currants and raspberries. Phorphoric acid may be obtained from all the bone preparations, from basic or "Thomas" slag, which Is a by-product in the manufacture of steel by the Bessemer process, and from the phosphate rock mined in the southern states. As mined and ground, the phosphoric acid, in this rock, is not directly available for plants. It i* commonly treated with sulfurlc acid to render this phosphorus available, being then known as acid phosphate or superphosphate. Phosphorus is probably the least important element of plant-food for the fruit-grower, being largely con - cerned In seed production. Potash is the element which has generally been considered of mosi importance in fruit-growing, but there are Indications that its Impor </seg>
            <seg id="p111">111 Ki may have been overestimated. At all events, the Nebraska fruit er is fortunate in that nearly all Nebraska soils are particularly rich in this element. He Is not likely to feel any especial need of it for a long time to come. Wood ashes afford one of the best sources of potash, when available The supply, however, is limited and the quality uncertain. The German potash salts, either muriate or sulfate, are the most available forma in which potash can be had. Since the fruit-grower, wherever located, can secure his nitrogen supply from the air by means of cover-crops, leaving only the two cheaper elements, phosphoric acid and potash, to be supplied, and since 'potash, the moat important of these, is already present in large qualities in his soil, the Nebraska fruit-grower can congratulate himself that for him the fertilizer problem is easily solved. KThe report of the Premium Revision Committee was accepted and 1 be incorporated in the revised recommended list of fruits and orna - «als. REPORT OF AUDITING COMMITTEE. ■your committee, have carefully examined the reports of the See nd Treasurer, and find them correct. G. A. MARSHALL, R. A. EMERSON. C. H. GREEN REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. The past season has been one of disappointment to a great many horticulturists in the production of fruit. Trees and plants came through the winter in fine condition, and promised an abundant yield. The month of March, being exceptionally warm, advanced the fruit buds to such a stage that the cold freezing weather of April and May destroyed almost the entire crop of tree fruits. Grapes and some of the small fruits made a good crop. The orchardist who was fortunate enough to have Genet in his orchard, had a good crop of this variety; owing to the late bloomins they escaped late freezes. There were enough peach buds for a good crop until the night of May 12. The freeze then killed the greater portion of them. The conditions were about the same in our adjoining states. In this off year we managed by the help of our old exhibitors and some new ones, to fill our tables at the state fair, and made a good showing of fruit. The florists, as usual, filled their portion of the hall to over flowing. One of the orchardists of the state reports having had half the num - ber of bushels of apples that he had In 1906, and selling them for a little more than twice as much per bushel </seg>
            <seg id="p112">112 Some people think we are planting too many fruit trees, and that the business will soon be overdone. This, however, is not the case. Our people are learning to use more fruit each year. Not only our American people, but the foreign nations are using more of our products all the time. One mistake a great many growers and packers make, is in grading and packing fruit. More care should be given to have fruit selected and put in nice neat packages. We should do all we can to interest our young men in horticulture, and get them as members of our society. The students of the Experiment Station are taking an interest in our work, a great many of them are asking for our reports and bulletins. There are now 455 of them taking horticultural work at the Station, 23 of this number going from the State University here in the city. I have sent out from the office during the year 5,800 reports, 2,490 bulletins, 1,240 letters, and 600 programs. We have added to our membership list during the year ten life and eighteen annual members. Have lost one by the death of W. T. Harris, who was for a number of years our official reporter.

            <seg id="p121">121 KUAL MEETING OF THE MINNESOTA HORTKTL - TURAL SOCIETY. Ellis society is without doubt the best of its kind in the United State*, t in the world. The attendance at this, the 41st annual meeting, was largest known, notwithstanding the financial flurry. We wish to ion some reasons why the society has reached such a high degree of efficiency. First — At the time of its organization it had unusual difficulties to overcome which tested the courage and persistence of its members. Tne first orchards were of Eastern fruits and they were wiped out of existence. After infinite pains, hardier fruits like the Duchess and Wealthy were introduced. A terrible winter knocked out the foundation because the stocks were not hardy. Then old Boreas with frozen mercury in one hand and his terrible scourge of the north wind in the other, told them in plain language never to invade his domains again. It was then that the blood of heroes began to tingle in the veins of the sturdv members of the newly born society. They took up the challenge. They had charged by rushes before, but now, with seige-like patience slowly and surely they built up hardy orchards — hardy from lowest root to highest branch — they originated a new horticulture and created a new race. As a result of their continued efforts since that time, the apple crop this unfavorable year, was simply enormous, and they had on exhibition probably a finer collection than any state in the Union. Second — Another cause of their success is their intelligent and heroic leadership, backed by over 2.000 loyal members, all thrilled with en - thusiasm, feeling assured of victory: probably a more determined and devoted band never lived. Many of the early heroes with Peter Gideon have passed away, but the inspiration from their lives yet remains. Others took up their work like soldiers, grasping the flag from fallen comrades and rushed to the front. In this connection it may not be out of order to mention some of the present leaders: The president, S. B. Green, is professor of horticulture in the state university, a man of large experience and acknowledged autho - ity in planting, all over the Northwest. He is an author whose instructions are received without questioning. In manner he is prompt, genial and forceful and is in great demand as a speaker in other states. He has a fine voice, a clear-cut expression and the ability to tell what he knows in a convincing manner. In Nebraska where he addressed the United So - cieties, he had about a thousand hearers who went away delighted as from an intellectual feast. His promptness and enthusiasm thrilled the whole Emblage. keeping them in the best of humor, and at the highest Ion. The secretary. A. W. Latham, is without a peer. He is a practi - borticulturist. an educated man, and one of the best organizers we </seg>
            <seg id="p122">122 tknew. He took hold of the society in its half-formed state and ght order out of discord, and in some way infused confidence, enthu - siasm and hope among the members till he has the largest society in the United States, if not in all the world. He is always at work, keeps his office well stored with books an3 periodicals all the year around, and the influence of the society reaches out beyond the state and iF je center of influence through all the great Northwest. kProf. N. E. Hanson of South Dakota, the Wizard of the North, is a tnber and is always here. He is one of the busiest men on the list. pulled this way and that by one and another who are anxious to draw all the information possible out of him. He has gone into the very holy of holies of good Mother Nature, and is helping her to work miracles. By careful selection and crossing he has produced wonderful results. He is doing for the bleak Northwest what Burbank is for the Pacific Coast. We have seen some of his new creations and they are marvels. By cross - ing Prunus pisardi with the improved Besseyi. he has secured the finest ornamental shrub which will endure the cold of 40° below. He is breed - ing plums, strawberries and raspberries which need no covering out on the bleak prairies of the Dakotas. He displayed a giant growing tree, his hybrid of wild plum and Chinese apricot, and told of his successful search for a hardy alfalfa in Siberia when on his trip around the world last year for the U. S. Department of Agriculture. C. G. Patton of Charles City, Iowa, is the king of pomology; for 40 years he has been engaged in developing hardy apples for the Northwest. He had on exhibition 55 varieties of seedlings evolved by the most patient and persistent efforts. Thirty-five years ago he produced the R. I. Green - ing and cross between the R. I. Greening and the Duchess, giving the ex - cellence of onn and the hardiness of the other. This is one of the most prolific of the race and has. or will, add millions to the wealth of the Northwest. The pity of it all is that his efforts receive but little com - pensation. He seems to be going the same way good old Ephraim Bull went, who died in the Old Man's Home, a carefully disguised name for the poor-house. Mr. Patton has put his very life in the work and is now 75 years old and says pathetically, "I have arrived where I can't keep on and can't let go." His grand work has reached a climax where he must have help. Wyman Elliots, with more than three score and ten years resting on his shoulders, has produced several hardy apples and also a gooseberry which for size and prolificness seems to fill a vacant space. Clarence Wedge, for many years president of the society, always brings encour - agement and the treasures of new experience. * The large church, in which the sessions were held, was filled from the start. The meeting was reverently opened by prayer offered by Father Kellog, delegate from Wisconsin. December 3d was given to a discussion of small fruits and the afternoon to nursery topics. G&lt;?o. W. Strand spoke on "Hardy Stocks for Nursery Trees;" D. M. Mitchell on "Planting and </seg>
            <seg id="p123">123 REPORT ON THE MINNESOTA MEETING. Early Care of Nursery Stock;" C. S. Harrison, a life member, whose home is York, Neb., gave a paper on the propagation and care of perennials. At • :li tho meeting was turned over to the Rose Society, which is an auxiliary. On Wednesday evening the annual banquet was given, when about 200 people sat^down to a sumptuous repast. Then followed the general un - bend, when old men became boys again: when there was sense and non - sense — "The feast of reason, the flow of soul." This part of the meet - ing is always a success. After the election of officers came a splendid address by Hon. G. B. Bracket, I'nited States Pomologist from Washington, who took this oppor - tunity to escape from the routine of office and to see the surprises in store for him in the marvelous display of fruit. The afternoon was turned over to another auxiliary — the Forestry Society. This society is very efficient. It has as leaders some of the men in the state. The president, S. M. Owen, made a stirring address in which he highly recommended the Norway Poplar or "Sudden Saw Log" for quick results, as this is especially adapted for the making of boxes, which industry already takes a large per cent of our lumber. In the evening a very interesting steropticon address was given by P. V Collins, on Mexico. Friday morning was given to an exceedingly spirited and interesting plant breeders' auxiliary. In the afternoon was an orchard symposium. Pe meeting closed with a few short, sharp speeches from members elegates. This closed one of the most memorable sessions of the series. The blending of the four auxiliaries with the parent so - ciety was a noted feature. In some states we know of, there is a jealousy regarding these departments of the same great work, and they are antagonized instead of welcomed and fostered. Take it all in all there is probably no society on earth which equals this in the ability and devotion of its leaders and in the fidelity of the workers, scores of whom are engaged in the work of building up Iron - clad fruits, which will resist the trying climate of the great Northwest. E brilliant and thoughtful papers; the sharp discussion; the flashes of and now and then a short stirring speech, made the meeting a true to the last. C. S. HARRISON. York, Neb </seg>

Pawnee and Richardson Counties Phe year 1907 records the greatest fruit failure known since the begin of horticulture in southeast Nebraska. Never has there been a Oner &gt;ect than we had on March in, the mild winter had killed but very jf the tenderest peach buds, raspberries only seemed to be more or damaged, but all other fruit, from apples to pawpaws, were in an ideal condition. The summer conditions that existed in March brought out the blooms prematurely and on the 28th of March Japanese plums and apricots were in bloom, just thirty days earlier than the records show they bloomed in 1906. Some of the oldest inhabitants say that the same thing happened away back in the 60s and that a big crop of peaches were harvested, but the unprecedented cold April and forepart of May put a quietus to our fondest hopes. Several inches of snow on the morning of April 3 and snow K frost on the 10th and 17th. was more than any respectable fruit could d. In the southern part of the district Gennet apples were the only ones that made anything like a respectable crop. They were not allured by the first warm breezes to put on summer costumes and when the arctic weather came they were still wearing their frost proof jackets. In the northern part of the district some Winesaps. Baldwins. Ben Davis, etc.. were harvested. Nemaha county possibly had about the average crop of the district. In 1906 500 cars of apples were shipped and used for vinegar. In 1907 five cars were shipped and none used for vinegar. The per cent of a crop was less than that in Richardson county and more in Otoe and Cass. Nearly all the apples shipped were Gennets. They were very large, well colored and exceptionally free from worms. We are in hopes the worms all froze to death or starved. We are not particular which plan of demise they chose. Apple orchards at present prp in very fine condition and I find very few growers are discouraged as evidenced by the high price of land. One party recently refused $2,800 for a half interet in a seven-year lease on Penty acres. That means $800 per year for seventy acres of land that aid not rent for more than $250 per year for ordinary crops. Thirteen acres of land bought in 1898 for $500 planted to peaches, pears, raspberries and strawberries, sold in 1905 for $2,000; and 160 acres of fruit land sold for $21,000, while as farm land it would not have brought more than </seg>

Among the new varieties that are tested. Campbell s Early is the leader and has usually given ex - cellent satisfaction. The wide range of reports and the description of Campbell's Early leads me to believe that several varieties have been sent out as Campbell's Early. It is well never to buy any new varieties from any one except nurserymen with a reputation to protect. Plums, apricots and pears were a failure. Peaches were generally a failure, except for a few favored orchards, several orchards suppplying 200 bushels or more. The small fruit crop was quite spotted, strawberries being reported al - most a failure in some places and a big crop in others. The freezing weather in the spring did our berries less damage than the dry weather in May and the fore part of June, prices ruled high, and some very high records of receipts per acre were made as well as some very low ones: the average is about_$100 per acre. Raspberries were a very poor crop, all varieties making a very light yield. Blackberries made a good crop where ever they were taken care of. Nearly all varieties did well. The old reliable Snydera were very full and ripened their crop well. Lawton's were very fine. The new Mercereau was very full of the finest berries but none of the others were loaded with fine fruit as were the Blowers. Logan berries, Phenomenais and Primus berries were unable to stand the storms and were all failures this year, but the Himalaya blackberry, which is really a dewberry, ripened its first crop in Nebraska this year and were very satisfactory for one-year-old vines.

REPORT OF DISTRICT NO. 4 Comprising Lancaster, Saline. Jefferson and Gage Counties. The season of 1907 was very peculiar in the character of the months of March. April and May. This gave rise to unusual conditions and de - stroyed the major portion of the fruit crop. The month of March was accompanied by unusually warm weather. Fruit buds on the peach trees were unduly expanded and with some varieties on warm exposures they Kmed at least two weeks earlier than usual. In our home orchard cots were in bloom the first of April. About the middle of April we had serious freezes, followed May 14 and 24 by other periods of severe weather. The Wright peach endured the unfortunate weather of March and April. Our foreman thought we would have five thousand bushels of peaches in the home orchard until the fair promise was destroyed by the unseasonably cold weather coming May 14 and Mftv °4 Pder such conditions the major portion of our varieties of apples Many planters thought it would hardly be worth while to spray orchards and many did not even take the time to cultivate them Under such conditions the people of our district could not expect much merchantable tree fruit. In our home orchard we allowed the birds to harvest what few cherries were set on the trees, and I presume that most of the orchardists in our districts did the same. Protected by its usual habit of late blooming the Rawles Janet app&gt; set a full crop in our orchards. In many orchards the fair promise of a crop of Janet was lessened by the ravages of scab and codling moth. With some of our neighbors large trees gave only a bushel and a ha'f to the tree. The Winesap seems to have the habit of blooming a little later than most varieties and apparently it develops a scattering late bloom enab'ing it even in frosty springs to set some fruit. rwore surprised to note that the Day apple blooms late enough to full crop of fruit. This particular variety originated on The Sandy in northern Maine. and was introduced by the late R. N. Day, for - merly president of our society. Season, September; quality, fair. With us it has been rather late coming into bearing. It is unusually hardy and a late bloomer. This variety has been hardy and useful in far western Nebraska. Pthe orchard of Edward Scriven in Scott's Bliiff county, the trees much younger than with us in Saline county. </seg>
            <seg id="p127">127 ■ Wythe, a late fall apple, also proved to be a late bloomer and perhaps a half crop of fruit in 1907. In our home orchard we secured very, very few summer and fall apples, because of the severe weather of April and May. In the Vineyard. — The vineyards suffered quite seriously, as they were in bloom at the time of the severe weather in May. Fortunately the grape has the habit of forcing additional buds to take the place of the first shoots injured. We were therefore able to maTket about 30 per cent of the usual yield. As all kinds of fruit were in short supply the grapes tght belter prices than usual. The most of the crop sold for 25 lo 35 i a basket. The blackberry is a late bloomer, and rarely blooms until late May and early June, therefore, escapes all periods of late spring frost and where properly cared for may be depended on to yield an annual crop. Some years ago we were advised to mulch our blackberry plantations with straw to be applied eighteen inches in depth in early November before the ground freezes. A heavy mulch of straw at this season may nearly pre - vent the ground from freezing; doubtless allows the cane to draw a little moisture from the soil and thereby lessens the evaporation. The straw settles down and forms a mulch effective during the entire summer This mulch retains a sufficient amount of moisture and keeps the roots from drying out. Since we have began to use a straw mulch we have found the blackberry one of our most profitable crops. The fruit sold at from two to three dollars a case. We are planting the Snyder and the Mercereau. The latter variety has larger berries and they are better in quality than the Snyder. We are not quite certain as to its hardihood under all condi - tions. The Mercereau in our home plantation is doing well and giving Kllent satisfaction. It should be considered, however, that our home tations have the advantage of a straw mulch. Eje black raspberry we think wintered quite as well as usual and set •dinary crop, but owing to the dry weather of mid-summer and the that the average raspberry plantation is not protected by a straw ti the black raspberry did not give us good a crop as usual. Strawberries were perhaps about one-fourth a crop Spraying. — Very few people ;n this district spray their orchards. It is generally considered, however, that we must all spray in the near future. In our home orchards we have been using power spra&gt;ers eighteen years. E. F. STEPm Crete. Nebraska. REPORT FROM DISTRICT NO. 5.

            <seg id="p128">128 the several varieties that are still growing. The orchard contained 200 trees, the distance apart was twenty-four feet, which proved to be too close after the trees came into bearing. The outside rows were also planted too close to the windbreak. Were it not for this close planting a larger per cent of the trees would be living. Prom the 200 trees planted there are now 110 of them in good condition, the trunks of several of them measure five feet in circumference. The Ben Davis, Winesap, Domlne, Sheriff. Janet. Wagener. Wealthy. Monarch, Cole's Quince. Autumn Straw - berry and Duchess of Oldenburg have all been good bearers, and are what I consider long lived trees. The following varieties did not give good results, they dwindled and died, or blighted to death soon after they came into bearing: Sweet June, Talman's Sweet, Grimes' Golden. Early Harvest. Snow and the several different varieties of Siberian Crabs excepting Whitney No. 20. Noticing in the report that the Cooper's Early White. Jonathan and Missouri Pippin are recommended for this district, I can testify that the Cooper's Early White is good for three or four crops, but when the trees get old the fungus and scab put them out of business. The Missouri Pippin (ioes not seem hardy enough to make a good thrifty growth, it has the wore! system of roots of any tree in the orchard. As to the Jona - than. I feel warranted in saying that I can make more money in growing Ben Davis. Romanite. Wealthy and Duchess of Oldenburg at ten cents a bushel than I can growing Jonathan at one dollar a bushel. The fruit crop came the nearest last season to being a failure in the district that it ever has since we commenced growing fruit. Were it not for the late blooming varieties, such as Janet, it would have been a total failure. But we are hoping for good results from last year's failure. There are no larvae of the codling moth hidden under the old bark of the trees in the orchard. We may well hope for a better quality of fruit free from worms this comtng season. P. A. MURPHY.

In fact we had the best crop of blackberries ever grown in this district. </seg>

ROBERTS NOTES FROM EXPERIMENT STATION. YORK. NEBRASKA Ornamental Hkikjes These are in great demand for wind-breaks out on our wide prairies, and also for ornament. We might divide them into two classes — the orna - mental and the ornamental and defensive. The following named shrubs are especially adapted for this work. The Spikkas Arugta. This is the earliest of the whole family, blooming with the tulips, a snowdrift of white before the leaves appear. It retains its leaves till December and is noted for its rich and variegated foliage after the frosts, when the whole row seems in flower with the autumnal colorings From first to last it is very attractive. It is grown from seed or root divisions, which increase rapidly. I Von Houtti. This is among the hardiest and most floriferous Neither the these need shearing, unless you clip some of the outreaching nches. Both kinds seem made for hedges, as they natura'ly shape mselves. This grows readily from cuttings or divisions. Opulifolia, or Tree Spirea. This Is by far the rankest of the whole family. I have had them make five and even six feet the first year, from cuttings. The flowers are very unique, a hemisphere in form. Put two together and yiu have a small baseball. As the name indicates, it is rich in foliage. The flowers continue the longest of any bloom we know of. First they are white, then they change to yellow, gradually turning till the seed is ripened. This is hardy in Manitoba. Where you need a vigorous, strong, ornamental hedge, this will be the thing. It grows readily from seeds or cuttings. The Golden Spirea is a sport or variation of the Opulifolia, and this makes a charming hedge. We saw one in Minneapolis on a cloudy day. It was very beautiful, and though the day was dark, it looked as if a flood of sunlight was resting on the hedge top. The color, however. Is variable. It shows best in a dry season. Some years the color seems to fade out badly and as the hedge grows older the color becomes dimmer </seg>
            <seg id="p130">130 Yet it does make a hardy and beautiful hedge. It bears shearing, so you ran keep it in any form you like. Pithony Waterer is the progeny of Bumalda. which It much resembles, the flowers are red. while those of the mother are pink. These are dwarfs and are much used for border hedges. Collosa Alba, also a dwarf, is used for the same purpose. They are in - clined to kill down, but they grow up again and commence flowering and continue in bloom most of the summer. LoNKKKAS. OR TRUE HOSEYSl'CEUM These are growing in favor with horticulturists. For years we have been advocating them for hedges. They are generally planted singly. ••here they do not show to as good advantage for this purpose as when planted in a row. On our grounds we have shown the rows to horticul - turists who decide that they are just the thing for this class of orna - mentation. They are very hardy, and it must be a very severe and un - timely freeze which can affect them in the least. In color the blooms range from white to dark rose. The Ruprechtiana. or Manchuria, is a very robust and hardy shrub, fine in flower and showy in fruit. Then we have the Chinensis — the Orientalis. the Siberian, and five different forms of the Tartarica, also the Marrowi. which in the east is the most popular of all on account of its profusion of flowers and great masses of berries which peer out from the foliage. This will need some shearing to keep it in place as it is of a sprawling habit and is much used to cover rocks, clay-banks, and to adorn unsightly and rough grounds. El'e like the Grandiflora the best of all, for its vigorous growth, large ;rs and showy fruit. These grow from seed and we have seen among seedlings some very fine and beautiful specimens. They also grow ily from cuttings. We have discarded the Siberian form on account of its inferior flowers. All are hardy and we do not have to retain this on that account, so it has gone onto the brush pile. The Privet, or Ligustrum, is often used. The California type, which probably originated in Japan, is much used. It is dwarfish in habit and retains its foliage a long time, which is fresh and green until the middle of November. The beautiful and charming Golden Privet is a sport of this variety. It is of exquisite beauty, especially after the first frosts. I'nfortunately both are a little tender some years. Ee Vulgaris, or common privet, is much used. This has a silver type, pronounced while young, but when it gets age it reverts back to the r'hp Russian, or Amaurensis, has been introduced as something per - y hardy. With us it kills to the ground and is no more hardy than others. The Regeliana is es|&gt;ecially beautiful with its fan-like system of </seg>

They should, if injured, be cut to the ground, when they will grow up into good form again. They are raised from cuttings, only me care must be used to secure them before the heavy frosts. Berberis. or Barrkrky. The purpurea or purple form makes a very attractive hedge, and will endure a good deal of shearing. This has beautiful flowers and purple The Vulgaris or, common barberry is generally used The Thunbergii is from Japan, and is very popular for dwarf hedges. It is noted for the charming autumnal effect of its foliage and enormous masses of fruit. The Armour Barberry is considered by far the hardiest and best of all. especially for Minnesota and the Dakotas. It is very vigorous and bears enormous crops of berries, which are said to make good jams and jellies. All these are raised from seed. Tamarisks I At great expense we secured ten kinds of these shrubs and subjected m to tests of our variable climate and have discarded all but the silver e, which is also called Amaurensis. Odessiana. and Armour, four names for one shrub. This is eminently satisfactory It is very successful in the semi-arid regions. We have sent thousands to Pueblo. Colo., where they \ are used for cemeteries and parks. They give entire satisfaction. They are fairly hardy as far north as central Minnesota. Aside from the beautiful, feathery foliage, the twigs are lined with dainty little pink blossoms which lend additional charm. These grow readily from cuttings. They are tardy about starting m the spring, but grow with great vigor when they do come up, making from two to four feet the first year. OrNAMKNTAI. AM) DKKKNSIVK HEDOF.H The Shepherdea. or Buffalo Berry, is sometimes used. This belongs to the Eleaguns. or Wild Olive family. It has silvery leaves and in its own habitat, surrounded with other bushes, it is fruitful, but it seldom bears out in the open. We have large bushes ten feet tall, which have never borne. It sprouts from the root and is not satisfactory. The Russian Olive belongs to the same family and one can be grafted or budded on the other. This, however, makes quite a tree when out by itself, attaining a foot in diameter and forty feet in height, rather too strong for an ornamental hedge, but all right for a windbreak. Both kinds are raised from seed. Russian Olive grows from cuttings. The coming hedge, however, will be the Siberian Hippophae. or Buf- </seg>
            <seg id="p132">132 falo lierry, often called Siberian and Sand Thorn. The name Hippophea was originally given to the English buck thorn as the fruit was con - sidered poisonous for horses. It has since been applied to this Siberian shrub, not on account of the fruit, but because of its very sharp thorns. This was introduced by Professor Hansen. For ornamental and defensive hedges and also for fruit, it is without a peer. In the autumn we saw these growing on the grounds of the state university of South Dakota and never, on anything that grows, did we see such a burden of fruit. They seemed wedged and clinging to the branches in great golden masses, so heavy, often as to break them down. They were in bloom that terrible spring when it was freezing every night and while those frosts killed almost all other kinds of fruit, it made no impression on them. The fruit, like our own Buffalo berry, is not so good eaten from the hand as when made into jellies and jams. For the great, bleak north - west, where fruit must I;e scarce, it will be of immense value. We are us these in York, where they seem well adapted to the climate. They are raised from seed, which is a somewhat difficult matter, and none but an expert need attempt it. Should you wish to buy a few to test, you must get at least a dozen to be sure of having some of the bearing kind, as the plants are male and female. Ems. briefly, we have given simple directions, in this department of mentation for defending the fruit, the flower and vegetable garden, have your ground in good condition for your plants and cuttings, r plant in a slight depression, pressing the earth solid around them, cultivate! cultivate! till well established. York. Nebraska C. S. HARRISON, Superintendent. REPORT OF DIRECTOR OF DISTRICT NO. 12 Comprising Adams. Kearney. Franklin and Webster Counties ■being aware of my appointment as director of this district until a ■s ago, my report will be somewhat meagre in detail. In this district there are no large commercial orchards. The largest of which the writer has any knowledge is in the eastern part of Kearney county, belonging to J. T. Kelly, the same being about twenty acres, mostly of apples. The above orchard has borne crops of fruit from very light to fair in years when conditions were favorable for producing the same. A fairly good crop of cherries, plums, apples, and. in some places, of small fruit were grown in the summer of 1906. The season was also a favor - able one for the development of fruit buds and everything going into winter quarters in good condition. So that in the early spring of 1907. the prospects for an abundant crop of all kinds of fruit was never better. The long-continued cold and freezing weather from the Dakotas to the Gulf, coming the latter part of April and continuing so late in May, that the crop in this district was almost totally destroyed with the exception </seg>
            <seg id="p133">* 133 of the small fruit which produced the fruit on the new wood. We were somewhat surprised, however, late in the fall to find a small orchard ten miles north of Minden which produced 150 bushels of Genitens of good quality. Well-developed fruit-buds at the present time are apparently in good condition. The amount of planting in prospect for the coming spring is about the same as usual. Central and western Nebraska, being some distance from the growers In the eastern part of the state has long been a dumping ground of a lot of worthless stock, untrue to name and without regard to recommended varieties sold by men representing nurseries out - side of th'e state. The greatest need of the average planter in the west is to learn how not to be grafted by the average tree-agent, or rather the dealer, as there are but few that are, strictly speaking, agents at all. We believe, as a rule, the list of recommended varieties for the various dis - tricts is much too large. Better plant more liberally of well-established varieties and leave the experimental part to the nurseryman. I would recommend in the 12th. 13th and 14th districts largely the same varieties.

I report that the 4,000 trees that were planted here for experiment — a good part furnished at the state's expense — are doing exceedingly well. I have now rooted out all worth - less sorts — those that winter-kill, and now have solid blocks. No irriga - tion is used here, hut thorough cultivation.

Wragg and Baldwin are doing well. English and all sweets will winterkill. Of plums the only sorts sold by nurserymen that I can recommend for planting are Sandoz. sold by Crete nurseries, grafted. They can be had from me also on own roots. All others on their list are too late in ripen - ing for Northwestern Nebraska. I have five new kinds already which I obtained by crossing DeSoto with Sandoz. They are better plums than any yet known and earlier, but no trees are yet for sale.

Plant the graft four to six inches deep, mostly on sandy land. This station now looks like an oasis in the desert — a patch of Cali- fornia thrown by an earthquake into western Nebraska. For years I have sold hundreds of bushels of fruit All small fruits do well. I have an unlimited lot of juneberries, dew- berries, gooseberries, asparagus, currants, blackberries and raspberries for free distribution. Everybody is invited to come and get them this spring for planting on their grounds. Also everyone interested in horticulture in this section should visit this place in summer or in fall and see what fruit western Nebraska will grow under intelligent management. Ordi - narily beware of traveling tree-peddlers who have some new trees or grafted on oak By following the above directions every farmer can handle his own orchards, and don't need to put a fortune in it. Of course trees must be cultivated like corn. Plow between them a few years until the plow cuts the roots, then only cultivate, and finally pulverize only. In four years plum trees bear one bushel per tree; cherry do nearly as well; and at most places bear at four to five years. Prairie grass must be first killed on the land by thorough plowing, otherwise it takes all the moisture and trees suffer. JULES A. SANDOZ, Director Sandoz Experiment Station. Section 1, 29-45, 40 miles northeast of Alliance Salem. Oregon. December 19, 1907. To the Member* uf the State Horticultural Society of Nebraska: KI received the program for the winter meeting. It put me in mind the days that I have spent with you at the meetings. So. if you will e me a few moments of your valuable time. I will tell you of some of the new fruits and the mode of cultivation here. I have thought If the same care and work was done in Nebraska, there would be fewer failures. I* spent last summer with my son on his farm. He has 900 cherry and 600 peach trees, nine acres of strawberries, two and one-half acres of Logan and blackberries. The strawberries are planted three by three feet, the rows cultivated both ways. He plows between the rows in the spring with a seven inch plow, throwing the dirt from the hills, plows often with a five-tooth cultivator, and finishes up with a tool he calls a clod-crusher; that leaves the ground smooth and forms a dust bed that holds the m ure. When it rains and the ground bakes or the weeds start, ha goes through again with the cultivator and crusher, keeps this up until th» berries begin to ripen. After the berries are all gathered, the tops are cut off with the hoe and burned. Then the cultivation is kept up until the </seg>
            <seg id="p136">136 rains come in November. He has a half-acre patch that plants were three years old last summer. He picked 200 (24 box) crates that sold for an average of $1.00 per crate. The berries that are put on the market are all faced, as they call it. the largest berries are laid m rows on the top of the box. threes and fours and fives in a row. We use the Hallock square box: in threes, nine berries fill the top of the box; of the fours it takes sixteen. The leading berries are the Wilson, Clarks, Oregon and Magoon. The Oregon and Magoon are ever-bearing, have fruit all summer, they are large and sweet, the finest table berry grown, are new and originated here In Oregon. The Logan. Phenomenal and Mammoth blackberry are new and are money-makers. My son got one crate to the hill last year. His vines were three years old. They plant in rows six feet apart, and vines twelve feet in the row; 550 plants to the acre. The berries sold for 75 cents to $1 per crate. The Logan and Mammoth blackberries ripen just after the strawberries. The berries are large, average one and three - fourths to two inches in length. The Logan berries are three to four weeks in ripening, from the time you pick the first until they are done. That gives the grower a chance to get his berries on the market. The Phenomenal ripens all at once, you get them all in about two or three pickings. So. if you have a large field, it requires a great deal of help at one time and gluts the market. The vines are put up on wire trellis like grapevines. Each vine will grow fifteen to twenty feet long and some will be an inch in diameter. They can be laid down and covered in winter like grapevines, if the weather should be too cold for them on the trellis. At one time last season the market was overstocked with Logan berries for a short time. Some of the growers thought they were up against it as they did not know what to do with their berries. Some fitted up their prune dryers and dried some of the berries, and found them tbe better than the dried raspberry, selling readily at 25 cents per nd. wholesale. The canning houses were slow to take hold of them only in a very small way. not knowing how they would sell on the market. They are now offering to contract for next year's crop at a good price. Some of the older fields of Logan berries where they were taken care of last year net the grower more than $50(1 per a"re. The cultivation is the same as for the strawberry. The cherry crop last year was good. B. F. Ferguson at Eola. one mile from my son's farm picked and sold to the cannery in Salem 27.500 pounds of cherries at five cents per pound, from 148 trees, that are fourteen years old growing on one and one-half acres of land. He has eight acres in fruit, and has refused $1,000 per acre for it. tThe Wallace's orchard, four miles from Salem, market pears and iles in London. Bngland. The Oregon apple is in demand in China.

LINCOLN, \MIKASKA Ere enumerate a few of the more common diseases of greenhouse There are many more that are less common, although when they may be very destructive. BEGONIA. Ml M&gt;m— Root-Oaixi {Hetrrixiera radii icola) — Small pointed thread worms make entrance Into the roots of the Begonia and work up into the stems and leaves, living off the host. Have been reported in Nebraska but not very injurious. The best way to get rid of them is by sterlizing the soil or else entire replacement of soil. All affected plants should be destroyed. CARNATION ionose. — Small brownish spots appear on the leaves, with a yel - lowing of the foliage. This is caused by insects puncturing the leaves, leaving an opening for bacteria. Bid Rot {sporutrii Jium anthiiphihim). — Any stage of the bud may be affected by this disease. A rotting of the flower parts results which inter - feres or prevents the opening of the bud. The petals are probably most affected, becoming discolored. This disease is accompanied by a mite which plays a secondary part. Bud rot does not occur in well kept houses. Too great dampness assists in spreading and maintaining the disease, also the accumulation of debris favors the disease. (f'romj/'i'.v raryophyllinu*.) — Both leaves and stems are attacked at all stages of growth. Long patches of epidermis of perhaps an inch or more in length break open exposing the reddish brown teleutospores of the rust. The spores are carried from plant to plant by lateral spray - ing. Care should be taken to water these plants from directly above so that the spores be not carried to other plants. Elu't (I'stilago). — Smut attacks the stamens, converting the anthers spore-bearing sacs. The spores are violet in color in contrast to the ally yellow pollen grains. CENTURY PLANT Anthrac nosk {.Velanconium (.—Large, irregular, brownish patches ap - pear on the surface of the leaf somewhat sunken and wrinkled. These patches are made up of concentric circles.

E atones (Heterodera radicicola). — Nematodes gain entrance into the irough the roots, forming galls. As a result the leaves begin to turn and then brown at the margin, gradually dying. Sometimes called Rist {Phragmidium subiorticum ) . — This is a disease of the stem. Raised velvety patches containing masses of black spores are found on the twigs. The twigs become swollen and distorted. Infected parts should be gathered and burned. Rist {Phragmidium speciosum ). — In the spring the cluster cup 5e occurs causing swelling of leaf tissues. The spores are yellow in color. Later the dark winter spores are formed. These infected parts should be gathered and burned. IRed Simder. — Plants become covered with these tiny insects which cause coloration of leaf tissue. Later dead areas fall out and leaves curl up. aying leaves with water or kerosene emulsion will destroy insects. VERBENA.

SWKNK. rimber of insect forms have been actively injurious to horticulture state during the biennium between April 1st. 1906. and April 1st, id the chief ones of these are briefly treated in the following pages. The very important and distinctively harmful group of scale in - sects or coccids are dealt with in a separate paper immediately succeed - ing this one. Concise discussions of their life histories along with preventive and remedial suggestions for their control are incorporated in the discussions of these pests in the hope that a better knowledge of Ee points will materially diminish future injury, for. taken altogether, annual loss to Nebraska horticulturists due to the ravages of insect s is a very considerable item. THE CODLING-MOTH (Carporapsn pomiturila Linnaeus 1 The codling-moth is unquestionably the most destructive of all apple insects, probably exceeding in harmfulness all the other enemies of this fruit combined, and in Nebraska is the greatest enemy with which the horticulturist has to fight. In years of an average crop it is estimated that the loss to the country as a whole through this insect is annually about $11,400,000. while in this state alone it was said to have caused a loss of $2,000,000 in 1892.' It is not a native insect, but was introduced into America at an early date and had spread over much of the eastern United States before it was recognized. It reached Nebraska sometime in the early sixties and has proved an annual menace to our apples ever since that time. At present it is found in all countries where apples are grown, and is everywhere a serious enemy of that fruit. As is well known, the codling-moth is the adult or imago of the insect which as a larva bores into and devours the apple and several other related fruits, being commonly known in that stage as the "apple - worm." Pears are frequently attacked by it. but are rarely extensively injured. Crab apples, peaches, plums, cherries and apricots are also occasionally seriously attacked, but this happens only when apples are lacking and the insects are very abundant. Even the black walnut has been reported as one of its food plants, but possibly this "may refer to the following species. Its natural and normal food plant is the apple, and we can justifiably restrict ourselves to a consideration of the insect in its relation to that fruit. R-e are two broods of the codling-moth in Nebraska. Winter is as a larva in cocoons placed in cracks or holes In the trees, under k or underneath trash on the ground.

They lay their eggs chiefly iilion the upper side ot the leaves near an apple, or, less commonly, upon the apple itself, in the late afternoon and early evening. The eggs are flattened, oval in shape, white in color and aboui the size of the head of a pin. Fach female lays forty or fifty eggs during a period of less than a week, and in about eleven days these eggs hatch into young larvae.

The second application should be made immediately after the petals fall and should be a combination spray of Bordeaux mixture and arsenical as this is an especially important spraying for both the codling-moth and the cedar rust. Two pounds of arsenate of lead or one-third pound of Paris green should be added to each fifty gallons of the Bordeaux mixture. The object should be to get a drop of arsenical into "every calyx cup, and as the young apples are mostly upright on the twigs at this time the spray should be fairly coarse and shot down under heavy pressure from above by the aid of long extension rods. If a particle of poison is lodged in each calyx, when these close there will be something to take care of the 80 i&gt;er cent of larvae which will later enter at the calyx end. In about three weeks after the petals have fallen the eggs of the first brood are hatching and the young larvae making toward the apple and devouring portions of the leaves, and then a third spraying, preferably a combination one (to control leaf-spot and scab also), should be ap - plied. Seven weeks later the fourth application should be made to destroy the young larvae of the second brood and control the leaf-spot and bitter-rot, and, it necessary, a similar spraying may be made two weeks later. These sprayings will, if conscientiously and carefully ap - plied, in all ordinary years practically free the apple orchard of insect Eand fungous diseases. For formulae of the above mentioned ma - the reader is referred to Bulletin 1 of the Nebraska Insect Pest ant Disease Bureau. THE LESSER APPLE-WORM Hum muni&lt;i iniiiihuia Walsh) The injury to apples by this insect has almost always been attributed to the codling-moth, even by professional entomologists, until the last few years, owing to the great resemblance of its work, life-history and habits and even the larva itself to those of the better known species. It is probably a native insect which fed originally upon wild crab apples, haws and plums and turned its attention to cultivated fruits when these came to be known in America. At the present time it is known to occur over most of the eastern United States and southern Canada. In south - eastern Nebraska this worm is present in distinctly harmful numbers, and was found in 1906 by the government entomologists to be "every - where abundant and destructive, and late in the season almost equally so with the codling-moth."' Consequently it will be well for the horti - culturist to be well informed concerning the life-history and methods of fighting this newly recognized enemy of the apple. In most important points the life-history of the lesser apple worm 1 Quaintance.

The winter is usually passed as fullgrown larvae in cocoons tucked away in crevices of bark and similar protected nooks. These cocoons are made of bits of bark and lined with a whitish silky substance, and are thus so protectively colored as to be difficult to find. In the spring the larvae pupate, and in two weeks or a little longer the moths emerge. By the latter part of June and early in July full grown larvae are to be found on the apples, which give rise to the second brood of moths during July and August, especially in late July and early August. At least the earlier of these give rise to a second generation of larvae which pass through the following win - ter, beginning to spin up in late September. They do not reach full size so early as the codling-moth, and sometimes continue to feed on the apples after they have been picked and barreled. Figure 3. The Lesser Apple-worm: u b, adult moth; c, larva; 4. cocoon; e, young apple showing at calyx end empty pupa skin from which moth has emerged. (From Quaintance, Bulletin No. 68, part V, Bureau of Entomology, p. 55.) Pi first brood of larvae does its principal injury to the calyx end apple, where holes from a quarter to a half inch in depth are about the calyx lobes and core within. Most commonly the larvae enter the calyx and bore into the fruit or under the skin, or else "blotch mines" are formed under the skin in the calyx basin or, less commonly, on the sides of the apple. The second brood of larvae injures the fruit as above described but usually the larva penetrates more deeply, often quite to the seeds, and commonly eats out large, shallow, Irregular mines just below the skin of the apple, thus greatly disfiguring the fruit ■ grown larvae are from one-fourth to one-third of an inch loos. flesh-colored with a brownish head. It is thus quite similar to &lt; </seg>
            <seg id="p146">146 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. the larva of the codling-moth but is much smaller. While apples are the fruit most injured, others of our cultivated and wild fruits are subject to attack by this insect. Wild and cultivated plums, prunes, peaches, crab apples, cherries and various species of haws (Crataegim) are also devoured, but Injury to these fruits is not very extensive. It has even been reared from elm and oak galls and "black-knot" of the plum. The close resemblance of the life-history of the lesser apple-worm with that of the codling-moth makes the application of sprays for the latter equally valuable in the control of the former, hence there need be no additional efforts made to fight the new pest. The larvae of the first brood will be for the most part destroyed by the poison in the calyx cups, although some which bore into the fruit at the outside base of the calyx lobes would escape, while spraying for the second brood of codling-moth will again be of help in destroying a large number of the young lesser apple-worm larvae of the second brood. THE LEAF CRUMPLER (ifineola indiginella Zeller) Within thr last two years a considerable number of orchardists have sent in the rases formed by this insect with inquiries as to the nature (Figure 4. The Leaf Crumpler: a, tube with head of larva protruding; base formed of mass of tubes and leaves; c, enlarged head of larva; d, ult moth. (From Riley, 4th Missouri Report, p. 36.) of their author and asking suggestions for its control. Two areas in particular, Cedar and Madison counties in the northeastern, and Custer, Dawson and Frontier in the southcentral portions of the state, have been troubled to an unusual extent, considerable harm being done by this little pest. The maker of the cases is the larva of a little moth which is very common and harmful in the Mississippi valley, but less so in the eastern statM. </seg>
            <seg id="p147">147 There is but a single brood each year, and the winter is passed by the caterpillars in these odd-appearing cases which they have formed. The larvae are only about one-third grown at this time," so when the trees begin to leaf out in the spring the little caterpillars leave the cases and commence to feed upon the opening leaves. Feeding is done mostly at night, the daytime being spent hidden in the cases. By the end of May they have become fully grown and pupate within their cases and early in June the moths appear. Eggs are laid for the coming generation during July and these hatch very soon into young worms which begin feeding and construct for their protection a new case of silken tubes surrounded by leaves bound together by silk. When the leaves fall these cases are readily seen, appearing as a mass of crumpled dry leaves firmly attached to the twigs by silken threads, usually in small clusters, and containing one or more long twisted tubes narrowing to a point at one end, and in these tubes the caterpillars may be found. The tubes are constructed of silk interwoven in the excrement of the larva. During the summer, when the insects are at work, the mass of leaves would not be seen among the dense foliage of the trees. The leaf crumpler affects chiefly the apple, but also the pear, plum, cherry, quince and crab apple. It is the victim of both hymenopterous and dipterous parasites, but is on the whole largely protected from these enemies by its retiring habits. It may be artificially controlled by gathering the cases during the winter when they are readily found, or by spraying with some arsenical ic the early spring before the bloom - ing period, when the little larvae first begin their attack. But unless it is very abundant in the orchard the ordinary sprayings for the codling - moth as recommended on a preceding page will prove sufficient to kill most of the larvae before they reach maturity and thus prevent the laying of eggs for a following generation. r WHITE-MARKED TUSSOCK MOTH (Hemerocampa leucottigm* Abbott and Smith). I During the summer of 1907 there was an unusual outbreak of this ect in the larger cities of the southern portion of the state, notably Omaha, Lincoln and Nebraska City. Many inquiries were received con - cerning the identity and general habits of the brilliantly colored cater - pillar which was proving such a pest on the shade trees and in the orchard, so that the writer was impelled to prepare an article for the "State Journal" of September 20 in which these points were fully discussed. This insect has for many years been very injurious to almost all the common shade and fruit trees of the region east of the Missis - sippi, and has been spreading over this state for the last fifteen or twenty years. It is pre-eminently a pest of city trees, largely owing to the fact that in the cities the native birds which habitually feed upon it have been suppplanted to a great extent by English Sparrows, which will not eat these hairy caterpillars, and it thus has a chance of </seg>
            <seg id="p148">148 periodically escaping from its natural enemies and doing much harm. In all the larger cities of New York state this moth has become an annual affliction, and in 1898 and again last summer it practically de - foliated many trees in the streets and parks of those cities. They are »«cially injurious to boxelder, cottonwood, elm, maple and apple trees this state. This caterpillar is a handsomely marked creature — bright ■ #^gy | Figure 5.

This of course the mature caterpillar, which is ready to spin its cocoon </seg>
            <seg id="p149">149 rthis stage is reached. In so doing the long hairs are interwoTen the silk so that the pupa becomes almost smooth. These cocoons, often with the pupa enclosed, may be found In the crevices of the bark on nearly any tree in infested cities, and in badly infested trees dozens may be found clustered in the more protected spots. They are also exceedingly common on the sides of houses and on fences. In Nebraska there are two full broods of the tussock-moth each ye»r, but northward there is but one, while southward there are threee. The winter is passed in the egg stage, these being found in great mil of three or four hundred, the whole mass covered with a frothy white secretion which hardens soon after extrusion, forming an excellent pro - tective covering. The eggs are spherical, glossy white and about a milli - meter in diameter. They hatch in May and the young caterpillars frequently hang by a silk thread, and are pale yellowish white and covered with long hairs. They continue to feed and grow for about a month, the females becoming considerably larger than the males and undergoing five molts, one more than do the males. Early in July they spin their cocoons and transform into pupae, where the sexual disparity in size is very apparent. In ten days or two weeks the adult moths emerge. Here again the sexes are very different; the females are stout, gray, hairy insects without distinct wings, while the males are supplied with broad, beautifully-marked, gray wings, large, feathery antennae and peculiarly-tufted legs. The female, wingless and with her abdomen dis - tended with eggs, crawls out upon her cocoon and deposits her eggs there or near by in the large masses already described, after which she dies. In about ten days these eggs begin to hatch, liberating young caterpillars of the second brood, which spread to the uninjured trees and prove very harmful. This hatching of the second brood continues through latter August to middle September. The early-hatched cater - pillars are mature by early September and pupate in a few days, giving rise to an abundance of cocoons such as may then be found everywhere. During the latter half of September the second brood of moths emerge*, and lays the egg masses which are to carry the species over the winter. Where native birds are normally abundant the tussock-moth does not become injurious, for over forty species will feed upon the caterpillars of this kind, including many common birds, such as the robin, Baltimore oriole, the vireos and our cuckoos. In addition to the birds, the cater - pillars are attacked, by numerous predaceous and parasitic enemies. One which kills the caterpillars in large numbers is the Spined Soldier-bug (Podtiut spinosu$), a brilliantly-colored black and yellow bug, which by means of a long, jointed beak perforates the caterpillar's body and sucks out the body juices. These bugs also perforate the cocoons and kill the Over twenty different kinds of parasitic wasps and flies are known to attack this caterpillar, the commonest of which are the species of Pimpla. These little black and yellow insects perforate the cocoons by </seg>
            <seg id="p150">150 tns of the ovipositor at the tip of the abdomen, and insert two to eggs within it In a few hours these eggs hatch and the larvae feed upon the caterpillar, becoming full grown in about a week, when they pupate, and a week later they emerge as adult wasps to destroy more caterpillars. These parasites destroy from 80 to 90 per cent of the second brood of caterpillars, and were it not for the fact that they sometimes do not pass the winter successfully, or are destroyed by par - asites of their own (of which there are fourteen species) would no doubt keep the tussock-moth continually in check. One of the simplest methods of preventing a recurrence of an injurious visitation of the tussock-moth is to gather and destroy the egg masses during the winter. This method has proved most beneficial in the cities of the east, where school children have been encouraged to collect the eggs by the offering of small bounties and prizes. The mature caterpillars leave the trees and wander about a great deal before pupa - tion, so that banding the trees has been largely practiced in many cities to prevent these wandering caterpillars from ascending the trees. Spray - ing with arsenical poisons is a well established and very effective remedy, and often the only one of immediate benefit to badly infested trees. It is inadvisable to destroy the cocoons until winter, since this will kill the parasites which are likely to be within them. ■ APPLE-TREE TENT CATERPILLAR (Malacosoma amerirana Fabricium). Fis leaf-feeding caterpillar was more than usually common during principally on cherry trees, but there were a few on the apple Its large, conspicuous tents were a common sight in many orchards over the entire state. The insect is a native species which is present over the whole of the United States and southern Canada east of the Rocky mountains and originally fed upon wild cherry, -wild plum and allied fruits. It attacks the cultivated cherry, apple, plum, peach, pear, hawthorn and rose and several other trees. The trees, if attacked in force, are quickly defoliated and the tents are enlarged as the caterpillars grow, until finally they become a foot or more in diameter and protect hundreds of the insects. This defoliation occurs during the spring and if it is severe so weakens the tree as to effectually prevent the develop - ment of fruit. The winter is passed in the egg state, the females depositing the eggs during the summer in belt-like masses encircling the twigs of the tree and then covering them over with a brownish froth which upon drying forms a tough protecting coat. Each of these egg-masses contains from 150 to 250 eggs and represents the entire product of a single female moth. When the warm days of spring arrive the larvae break from the egg-masses and venture out upon the foliage. In a couple of days they begin the formation of the tent, which grows as the caterpillars grow. During the cloudy weather they remain within the tent, but on </seg>
            <seg id="p151">151 rit days they come out to feed during the morning and evening at night. When they become full grown the caterpillars are about two inches long, black with a white stripe down (he back, and they then leave the tent and wander about seeking a suitable place to pupate. Any protected nook is available for this purpose and a coarse silken cocoon is spun. In about three weeks the moths appear — a dull reddish - brown insect with two parallel, whitish lines across the front wings, and the males smaller than the females. The females soon deposit their egg-masses and these remain unmatched, as stated above, until the follow - ing spring. As in the case of the preceding insect a large number of parasites attack this insect both in the egg, larval and pupal stages. Among these the species of the wasp-like parasites Pimpla (conquisitor, in- re 6. The Apple-tree Tent Caterpillar: a, eggraass: b. larva: c, pupa; (1, cocoon; female (left side) and male (right side) moths. (From Quaintance, Circular No. 98, Bureau of Entomology, p. 1.) quisitor and annulipes) are very prominent, while among the predaceoua insect enemies the Spined Soldier-bug (Poditus spinosus) is most im - portant. The same birds as will eat the tussock-moth will also devour the tent-caterpillar, and these form a most important natural check to this insect. As in the case of the tussock-moth the egg masses may be collected in winter, but as they are more protectively colored they are more difficult to find. The small tents should be destroyed as soon as detected, and for this purpose the use of an asbestos torch or a bunch of rags tied to a pole is practicable. Whichever is used it should be saturated with kereosene and applied to the tents in the smaller branches of the tree, while the tents in the larger branches should be torn out by hand so as to avoid injury to the tree by fire. Spraying with arsenicals is also a very satisfactory remedy, and in the case of the orchards </seg>
            <seg id="p152">152 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. thoroughly sprayed for the codling-moth there will be no harm done by the tent-caterpillar. In the case of shade trees, however, Paris green or arsenate of lead used at the rate of one-fourth pound or two pounds, respectively, to 50 gallons of water and neutralized by the same weight of lime as poison used, will destroy the caterpillars and not injure the tree; the arsenate of lead is, however, safer and more lasting, and therefore is more strongly recommended for this purpose. THE YELLOW-NECKED APPLE-TREE CATERPILLAR (Datana min - ittra Drury). This caterpillar was especially harmful during 1906 in some apple orchards, one correspondent at Nebraska City reporting that many trees of his orchards were completely stripped of leaves by it. It is becoming more generally distributed and abundant year by year over Eastern Braska as indicated by the reports received at thfcs office. The larrae n to appear late in July and at first eat only the softer portions Figure 7. The Yellow-marked Apple-tree Caterpillar: o, mature larva at rest; 6, moth; c, eggs; d, single egg, greatly enlarged. (From Riley.) fthe under surface of the leaves, but as they grow larger they devour e entire leaf except the heavier veins and the stem. When full grown they are about two inches long, dark colored, with four prominent yellow stripes along each side, and have the segment behind the head entirely yellow. They cluster closely together on a limb on the under surface of the leaves, and devour every leaf as they go, leaving the branches bare. Most of the severe damage is done during August. They leave the tree to pupate, which they do at a depth of from two to four inches in the ground, and remain in that stage until the following July, when the moths emerge. These are pale brown with the fore wings crossed by about five darker brown lines, and have an expanse of about two inches. Each female lays about a hundred white eggs in a single mass on the surface of a leaf and these hatch within a couple of weeks into larvae which resume the work of defoliation. The caterpillars may be destroyed either by hand picking when they are clustered together upon the leaves immediately after hatching or when molting upon the trunk of the tree, or else by the use of arsenical sprays. </seg>
            <seg id="p153">153 THE PEAR SLUG (Ericampoidet Hmacina Retzius). The pear slug was reported as injurious in 1907, and should receive brief consideration here. The first evidence of damage is the "skele - tonizing" of the upper surface of the leaves of the attacked trees, that is the upper surface is eaten away except for the network of heavier veins. Such leaves soon wither and fall, and if the insects are abundant the tree may be seriously injured. Examination of the leaves will reveal a number of dark-colored larvae enveloped in a slimy liquid, and these are the perpetrators of the injury. The trees chiefly attacked by this insect are the cherry, pear and plum, and three broods usually occur each year. Figure 8 The Pear Slug: a. adult female sawfly 6 larva with slime removed; c, same in normal state; d. leaves with larva, natural size. (From Marlatt, Circular No. 26, Division of " Entomology, p. 1.) Pie adult of these larvae is a small, black, four-winged insect, be - ng to the family known as "sawflies" because of the saw-like ovi - or of the female which is used in inserting eggs in plant tissues. r in the spring the females begin depositing ther eggs within the newly-developed leaves, using the ovipositor to form an oblique cut on the under surface of the leaf and then enlarging this to form a pocket just below the epidermis of the upper surface. Into this pocket a single, oval, white egg Is deposited and remains therein for two weeks before it hatches. 'When this finally occurs the young larva makes a semi - circular cut in the epidermis, crawls out upon the upper surface of the leaf and begins to feed upon the soft epidermal tissue between the veins, exhibiting a prodigious appetite. In three or four weeks it has become full grown, and during Its growth period has molted four times. The fifth and last molt is undergone and the slimy, dark coat is aban- </seg>
            <seg id="p154">154 r, so that the larva becomes a dry, orange-colored worm about a inch in length. It now crawls down the tree, burrows in the ground an inch or two and forms a pupal cell of earth. In about a week it pupates, and in another week the adult of the second brood appears above the ground. Some of them, however, do not thus develop but remain as larvae until the next year, and the same is true of certain larvae of the second brood. All of the larvae of the third brood remain in the ground through the winter, not pupating until shortly before their emergence as adult sawflies the next April. The larvae of the first brood work chiefly in latter May and June, the second brood in latter June and early July and the third brood (which was the one chiefly complained of in 1907) in latter July and early August. The pear slug is very easily destroyed by applications of arsenical spray or a wash with whale-oil soap. The arsenical may be made weaker than usual, since as the the slugs eat only the upper surface of the leaves, and this in large amounts, one-sixth of a pound of Paris green or one pound of lead arsenate to 50 gallons of water will prove sufficiently strong. Hellebore may be used effectively also, either as a spray at the rate of 1 ounce to 3 gallons of water, or as a dry powder dusted over the leaves. Figure 9. A Leaf -cutter Bee: bee, nest and cut rose-leaves. (From Comstock, Manual for the Study of Insects, p. 668.) </seg>
            <seg id="p155">155 THE ROSE SLUG (Monostegia rosae Harris). This is another Sawfly larva or slug which was injurious during 1907, the rose being the plant upon which it feeds. It skeletonizes the rose leaves exactly as the pear slug does the leaves of the pear and cherry, and has an essentially similar life-history, but is only two brooded, one brood appearing in June and the other in August. The same remedies as mentioned in discussing the pear slug will also apply equally well in dealing with this insect. THE LEAF-CUTTER BEES (Megachile spp.) During 1906 and 1907 several reports were received of injury not only to rose bushes but to cherry and plum trees as well, by the leaf - cutter bees. The cells in which the young bees are reared are made of the circular patches of leaves cut from the plants, neatly rolled together. Some of these bees burrow in partially decayed wood and use the leaf cuttings merely to line the tunnels and seal the cells. The damage done by these insects is, on the whole, very slight, and not of sufficient importance to warrant the taking of measures of control. (See Fig. 9. p. 154.) THE BUFFALO TREE-HOPPER (Ceresa bubalus Fabricius). Last year (1907) more than the usual number of complaints of injury to orchard and shade trees and nursery stock by the egg punctures of this insect were received at the office of the entomologist. Apple trees were most severely attacked, as usual, but a number of other trees, particularly soft maples, were also frequently damaged. In laying its eggs the bark on the upper surface and sides of the twigs and smaller branches is slit by the ovipositor of the insect, so as to form two short, parallel cuts which converge toward their ends, thus almost entirely separating the small central portion of bark. In these slits the eggs are laid in bunches of a dozen or somewhat fewer, and as the double cut kills the central area of bark they are thus saved from being crushed by the rapid growth of the young branch. This work is done from about the middle of August to late in October, and each female lays from one hundred to two hundred eggs during this period, perish ing at the approach of winter. The eggs, however, pass the winter safely and hatch during the following spring. The nymphs feed upon various weeds until they are fully grown, when they develop the winged adults. This occurs about the middle of July, the insects becoming very abundant during August and September. The adult buffalo tree-hopper is a very odd-appearing insect, being of a general triangular shape and having two large horns projecting sideways from the heavy front end of the thorax, the whole effect easily accounting for the derivation of its common name. In color it is bright green. The effect of its punctures is to cause the branches to become rough </seg>

Portions of two or three years' growth, either the new growth of oM trees or the whole of very young trees, are equally subject to attack. The eggs of the buffalo tree-hopper are attacked by parasites which destroy many of them, but nevertheless in poorly kept orchards, where there is an abundance of weeds upon which the immature stages of the insect may feed, the damage to the trees will often prove quite considerable. But if the ground between the trees is kept well cultivated the nymphs will be starved out, and the only injury that can occur will be from adults flying in from outside, so will never be considerable. It is easy to destroy the young of this insect by a spraying with kerosene emulsion, but the adults are so shy and liable to fly on the approach of a person that it is not advisable to attempt to combat them in thai stage. Twigs which have been severely stung should be pruned in the late fall and winter. Observation of these points will succeed In arresting the damage in seriously affected orchards.

This insect causing this trouble is a slender, yellowish-green creature which lives upon such soft - bodied insects as aphirts, and upon insect eggs of various species. The female has a strong ovipositor fitted for boring into the stems of plants, and the eggs are deposited in a regular row of punctures along the stem. They are placed obliquely across the pith, and are long and narrow and of a whitish color. The best method of preventing injury by this insect is to cut out and burn all the infested canes and twigs during the winter. THE PLUM CURCULIO (Conotrachelus nenuphar Herbst). As during preceding years, there were complaints of injury by cur - culios during 1906 and 1907, but as this insect, along with its colleague in crime, the apple curculio, was fully discussed by the writer in a former report to this society, it will not be mentioned further here. 1 tplum gouger (Coccotorus prunicida Walsh) was injurious to plums rtheastern Nebraska in 1906, but not very seriously so. ■Annual Report of the Nebraska State Horticultural Society, xxxvii. pp. 252-259 (1906). </seg>
            <seg id="p159">159 SCALE-INSECTS INJURIOUS IN NEBRASKA DURING 1906-1907. BY HARRY S. SMITH. The horticultural interests in Nebraska have up to the present time been remarkably free from the most injurious members of this group of insects, notably the San Jose scale and others, and it is to be hoped that a rigorous inspection law will soon be enacted so that this healthy condition of affairs may be continued indefinitely. The ease with which the eggs or the insects themselves may be transported upon nursery stock renders the introduction of the most injurious species inevitable unless drastic measures are taken to prevent it. But although we have no San Jose scale, several other species of the family are found here, some of them occasionally becoming quite harmful. These are taken up one by one in the following pages. The Scale-insects belong to the family Coccidae. which also includes the mealy bugs so commonly found in greenhouses. The members of this family are very strange in appearance and in habit. They also differ a great deal among themselves, the waxy covering when present being of many kinds, such as plates, tufts, or thick or thin scales. The males are very different from the females, undergoing a comple meta - morphosis and developing a single pair of wings with which they fly about in search of the other sex. Instead of having a mouth through which to take food an extra pair of eyes is developed in its place. No nourishment is taken after they emerge from beneath their scaly cover - ing. The females, after inserting their beak into the food-plant, are stationary for life, their legs, eyes, etc., gradually disappearing. Their only function is to deposit eggs for the next generation and die. Most of our harmful scale-insects are not native to this country, but have been imported from foreign regions upon nursery stock. Their peculiar adaptability to this method of dissemination makes them much to be feared, and in case of any exchange in nursery stock a close examination should be made in order to detect their presence. Should any of the pests be found an entomologist or reliable inspector should be consulted at once in regard to the matter. The treatment for these pests is practically the same for all species. On the deciduous trees where the eggs or scales remain upon them throughout the winter, it is best to apply the sulphur-lime wash, as it is much easier to handle, cheaper and less dangerous to the vegetation when thure are no leaves. At this time a much stronger wash may be used. It is made as follow^: </seg>
            <seg id="p160">160 Sulphur-Lime Wa*h Sulphur 1 pound Unslaked lime 1 pound Water 4 gallons First slake the lime and then add the sulphur and enough water to ke«p it from burning. Let the material boll until the sulphur is dis- solved, when enough water may be added to make the required amount. This may be applied with pump or brush. In case the above method does not kill all the scales or when they occur upon greenhouse plants a treatment with kerosene emulsion at the time of hatching will do a great deal of good. A solution of whale-oil soap is sometimes found to be even more effective. Following are the formulae for these two preparations Kerotene Emulsion.

Considerable injury has been done to apple trees during the past two years by the oyster-shell scale in Nebraska. This well-known and widespread insect was first recorded as occuring in this state during the year 1888 by Professor Conway McMillan. 1 During the succeeding years it has always been present in greater or lesser numbers, having increased with the extension of the fruit-growing industry so that it occurs pretty generally over the eastern portion at the present time. As is the case with most of our injurious scales it is not native to the -United States but was intrpduced from Europe over a hundred years ago on nursery stock. It Is of world-wide occurrence and is found in •Bulletin of the Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station, No. 2, </seg>

Besides this little beetle there is a mite (Tyroglyphus malus) which destroys a great many eggs and young scales, and a small four-winged wasp-like parasite (Aphelinus niytitas - pidis) which in its larval state lives beneath the scale and devours the eggs. This scale is not difficult to control if remedial measures are cor - rectly carried out. One of the most effectual methods is an application of the sulphur-lime wash during the winter or while the trees are dormant. This is effective in destroying the eggs. It should be applied in the proportion of 1 pound sulphur, 1 pound lime and 4 gallons water, and may be put on with either spray pump or brush.

Resembling in general characters the oyster-shell scale is the scurfy scale, found quite commonly upon apple trees in Nebraska during the past two years. It may be easily distinguished from the foregoing THE SCURFY SCALE (Chiona*t&gt;i* furfura Fitch) </seg>
            <seg id="p164">164 species by the grayish-white color, and is more flat, broader and not curved. The scurfy scale is a native insect of this country, differing in this respect from the preceding species. Originally it was a feeder upon the bark of the native crab apple, having since transferred its attentions to the cultivated varieties. Besides feeding upon the apple, it is occa - bionally found upon the pear and mountain-ash. In Nebraska it is not nearly as common as the oyster-shell scale and rarely does very much harm. The eggs of the scale here treated are purplish red, while those of the oyster-shell species are white. The life-histories of the two are very similar, although the eggs of this species are considerably slower in coming to maturity. Ehe same natural enemies which destroy the oyster-shell scale attack species and do a great deal of good toward preventing their in - &gt;e to injurious numbers. The artificial remedies mentioned in ection with the former apply to this insect equally well. THE ELM-TREE WHITE SCALE (Chiontuipui americana Johnson) Like the preceding, this scale is a native of our own country, and so far is confined to the United States. In Nebraska it occasionally be - comes injurious, although it is rarely a serious pest. Its life-history is very similar to the two insects just treated, it passing the winter in the egg state beneath the scale covering, the eggs hatching during the month of May, the young crawling about upon the twigs and stems until a suitable place is found, when they insert their beak and become stationary. The number of eggs varies from 15 to 85. The female of the elm-tree white scale is a pear-shaped insect, while the male is not as large and more slender, with a slight longitudinal ridge. In Nebraska only the common elm, Vlmus americana, is attacked by this insect, although it has been taken upon "camperdown" elm in other states. I Several natural enemies have been observed to feed upon this insect, luding the two parasites, Perissopterus pulchellus and Physcus varicomi*, I the twice-stabbed ladybird, Chilochorus bivulnerus. It is hardly likely that this scale will ever become sufficiently abundant to necessitate the adoption of artificial methods for its con - trol, but should such be the case the remedies recommended for the two insects preceding this one will apply equally well to the elm-tree white scale. THE PINE-LEAF SCALE {Chionaspis pinifoliae Fitch). Eiis scale also is a native of this country, and probably occurs in all of the Union as well as in some parts of Canada.

Should artificial remedies become necessary the emulsion of kerosene recommended on a former page will no doubt be effective in killing the scale if applied while the young are running about upon the twigs and leaves. THE COTTONWOOD SCALE (Vhionaayis urtholubin Comstock) Occasionally in Nebraska young poplars, cottonwoods and willows are seen which are literally plastered with a white scale. This is the cottonwood scale described by Professor Comstock from California in 1881. It has been quite abundant in eastern Nebraska for several years, and has also been found in Kansas, Missouri, Ohio, Massachusetts, and New Mexico. The life-history of the cottonwood scale has not been well worked out, but no doubt is very similar to the other members of the genus previously considered in this report. The eggs are purplish in color and probably serve to carry the species through the winter. 1 have no records of its being destroyed by natural enemies, but these will certainly be observed sooner or later. (See Fig. 18, p. lt&gt;7. ) As a remedy for this pest the sulphur-lime wash recommended for the oyster-shell scale on a preceding page, to be applied during the winter, will doubtless prove most efficient in its control. Should any escape this winter treatment they may be destroyed at the time of hatching by spraying with a 10 per cent emulsion of kerosene. THE COTTONY MAPLE SCALE (Pulvinaria innumerabilis Rathvon).

During the past two years this scale has not become sufficiently numerous to do a great deal of harm in any portion of the state, so far as is known to the writer, but it is always present in some numbers. Outbreaks like that of two years ago may occur at any time when the climatic conditions are just right, so it is well to know what to do in case an infestation should occur. THE WESTERN COTTONY GRASS SCALE (Eriopeltis coloradaui* Cockerell). During the summer of 1907 considerable alarm was felt by farmers and ranchmen in the southwestern portion of this state, when a strange "disease" became prevalent upon their wild wheat grass (Agropyron sp.) which they cut extensively for hay in that region.

            <seg id="p170">170 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. FORESTRY M'ORK IN NEBRASKA. PROF. F. J. PHILLIPS, UNIVERSITY OF XEHRAKKA. INTRODUCTION. The history of Nebraska's forest planting is that of its pioneers expressed in trees instead of words. Interwoven with the planting of forest trees in our state are the struggles for a home, the long, rambling trips of the "prairie schooner" and the privations which always come to the first settlers. The pioneer in the forest regions on all sides of us came with the whetted axe and cleared away enough forest in a year to give him farm land adequate to the needs of a lifetime. The men of the plains, however, made long journeys for their forest tree seed, seedlings or cuttings: they broke the wiry prairie sod with infinite care and then through long years of hard labor, battled to aid the growth of the number of trees that a woodsman could have slaughtered in a week. Out of the land once classed as desert, the men of the plains have made farmsteads which are ranked as the best in the United States, and in a land which was once barren of trees except along stream courses, we now have a landscape dotted and lined with forest trees of all ages. It may be appropriately said that it is the man vho prows a tree rather than the man who cuts one down uho knows the full value of tree groicth. EARLY WORK. The methods used and the results secured from the earliest planta - tions established in this state are unique to the plains regions. It was quite natural that cuttings should be used of our native, quick-growing species such as the cottonwood and willow. Native seedlings were also used of eottonwood, willow, green ash, boxelder, hackberry, red cedar and silver maple. The early settlers often journeyed fifty miles or more to the banks of some stream where they could secure tree stock and naturally they gave these trees the best care in their power. Tree planting in those early days was considered almost as essential as building a house, yet many of these early plantations were either total or partial failures. The reasons assigned are numerous. The worst causes, how - ever, were the wiry nature of the prairie sod and the frequent cases of severe drought. Numerous old settlers have told me that the only tree which could combat the original sod with any degree of success was the cottonwood and that it sometimes took years before the sod could be subdued so that even such a hardy tree as the boxelder could be grown with success. There were other causes, too, which brought about complete failures, such as prairie fires, poor or dried-out plant stock, lack of knowledge as to planting and cultivation and the introduction of trees from other region! unauited to this climate. Today we can </seg>
            <seg id="p171">171 t trees in any soil in the state with a better assurance of success the first settlers could on the richest soil, even when they carried water to each thirsty tree. The fact that such hardy trees as cotton - wood and boxelder most frequently proved a failure in the earliest planting, while today we are growing such trees as the magnolia and the southern pin oak at Bellwood, Neb., and a thrifty grove of white pine at Nebraska City, together with dozens of other species of the so-called "impossible trees." points to a wonderful step in Nebraska's progress. Many, too, are the stories that are told about the fight for shade about the home when the prairie fires ran like race horses. Almost as thrilling are the stories of those who spent their best life blood in establishing the first plantations. One woman relates how she planted trees about the homestead with a babe in her arms, and this is only one of the innumerable struggles that were made to secure good groves of forest trees. The second stage of Nebraska's great task of tree planting came when it was fully realized that the region was capable of growing successfully a large diversity of forest trees. The government tree claim act of March third, 1873, was the result. Most of the plantations made under this act were a failure because of the laxity with which the trees were planted and cared for. Too often the desire of the planter was to secure title to the land without any pretense of a successful forest plantation. Cheap tree stock was used in the majority of cases while occasionally it is known that seed was sown broadcast on land where sowing could not be productive of good results. However, there were a large number of conscientious men who did all in their power toward securing a successful forest growth, and some of the best planta - tions in the state are the result of such work. Without exception, the men who took care of their plantations have declared that the resulting growth has more than repaid them for all the expenditure involved. One has only to go to the vicinity of Ord, Elgin, Columbus, or an indefinite number of other localities in the central portion of the state to note some of the wonderfully beneficial results of the timber-claim ARBOR DAY'S GREAT MEANING. The third stage in Nebraska's forest planting came with the found - ing of Arbor Day by the late Hon. J. Sterling Morton. No monument could be more fitting to this greatest agriculturist of his day and cer - tainly none can be more lasting. In our state it has been variously estimated that from three to twelve million trees were planted the first year that Arbor Day was observed, and the planting during several subsequent years equaled or surpassed this. It is characteristic of J. Sterling Morton that he wanted all phases of tree planting to be repre - sented in the meaning of the day, and so it is that the fruit grower, landscape gardener and forester all pay tribute to his memory.

As a state, Nebraska has always been in the lead of the states in the great central prairie region and from this center tree planting has extended until now It Is an important factor In at least one-half of the states In the Union. Michigan, whose forests were once supposed to be sufficient to supply the world for all time, Is now Importing lumber from the south and west by hundreds of car - loads. It has ten millions of cut-over, sandy lands which once produced high-type forests and should be planted to forest trees again. Wisconsin and Minnesota are in a very similar position. In New England the land has been cleared for farms and has so deteriorated that a large per - centage has been allowed to revert to forest, so that there is actually more land in forest today than there was twenty or thirty years ago. Southern California with its immense areas of treeless land is planting the imported Eucalyptus by the millions and is giving that state its present position as the leading tree-planting state in the Union. In each of these regions the work in forest planting is much the same as in Nebraska, and what Nebraska has done and will do in forest planting will be closely watched hy her sister states. has been a pronounced success, and for the last five years the govern - ment, as well as a large number of private individuals, have been actively engaged in tree planting in the sandhills. Few if any of these plantations have been as successful as that of the Bruner brothers, but the sum total of the work has become of great importance and will be described in detail in a future article. It is mentioned here because It is one great stage of the work which has been done in the state and deserves the critical attention of everyone directly Interested in the milestones of the state's progress. RESULTS OF THE WORK It Is natural that these four stages should be productive of large results, and during the past decade many scientific studies have beea made in this state by trained men who realize the possibilities of certain phases of forestry work. It was found that the natural forests of the western part of the state needed study and Mr. Royal S. Kellogg, now BESSEY'S IDEA. The fourth great step in the forestry work of Nebraska was when Prof. Charles E. Bessey conceived the idea that the great sandhill region )f the state could be made to support a comparatively high class forest of soniferous trees. After considerable agitation, the United States forestry jfficials became interested in' the problem and agreed to furnish the xees if some one in Nebraska would furnish the land. Professor Bruner )f the State University and his brothers, H. F. Bruner and E Bruner, gladly donated the use of land in Holt county, and the experi- ment was started in the early nineties. From the first this experiment </seg>
            <seg id="p174">174 Eof the most prominent foresters, made a careful study of the region eh has been incorporated in bulletin No. 66 of the United States est Service. A similar study was made of the forests in the south - ern part of the state, together with the forests along our more prominent stream courses. One of the most interesting phases of this work proved to be that of the Hon. J. Sterling Morton at Nebraska City. He preempted his farm from the government in 1855 and found approximately six acres of land on which scrubby trees were growing. This land was not considered of high value, since it followed the course of a creek, and the general practice of most farmers in the locality wag to grub out the trees, since they were considered worthless. Mr. Morton, however, commenced at once to improve this "singed-dog wood - lot" by thinning, pruning and the restricting of grazing animals. In 1901 the stand was estimated to have yielded approximately $200 worth of fuel annually and to contain several thousand dollars' worth of standing timber. Pruning and thinning had resulted in straight, rapid - growing trees in a stand of decidedly high class. Natural reproduction was good because of the large number of seed-bearing trees and the excellent condition of the soil beneath these trees for a seed-bed. Pro - fessor Bessey made a study of the natural distribution of the forest trees, which was later added to somewhat by the government work. His results were published in the annual report of the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture for 1899 and are the most important contributions yet made on the distribution of forest trees in the United States. A vast amount of additional work could be done along this same line with increasing profit. Still another line of work done by the government is a careful study of the most of the forest plantations in the state to determine the relative growth, requirements and adaptability of the various tree species, together with their relative profit or loss. Most of this government work was under the charge of Prof. F. G. Miller, formerly of the State University. The results of the work were published in two circulars entitled "Forest Planting in Eastern Nebraska" and "Forest Planting in the North Platte and South Platte Valleys." As was to be expected, it was found that certain species are well adapted to commercial planting and give a comparatively large profit. Catalpa, where it can be successfully grown, is the most profitable species, but under specified conditions it was found that nearly every hardy species was of use to the private planter. During the past year an investigation has been made as to the efficiency of wind - breaks and the results will be published by Mr. C. G. Bates of the Forest Service during the ensuing year. E connection with the progress of forestry in this state and the 17 as i whole Chancellor Andrews and Professor Bessey early ed that a forestry course at the State University was essential, course has aimed to turn out a high class of scientifically trained ers who are competent to work for the government, various states </seg>

Last year this course was given to more agricultural students than in any other agricultural college in the United States and it is hoped that the study will be beneficial to the state at large. A forestry course is also given for those who are to teach in the public schools. FUTURE WORK. Eiraska's position in forestry, then, is a high one, but it should be higher. There are almost innumerable questions relating to for - n the middle west which should be worked out on the most com - prehensive plan. Owing to the importance of work on the national forests, the government .had largely discontinued the preparation of planting plans for the farmer. This work should be taken up by the state and should be made an important feature. Still broader study is needed for each of our prominent trees suitable for plantation pur - poses especially relative to mixtures and spacing. For this work, model or type plantations should be established in each county or group of counties and measured at short, definite intervals to determine exact methods of management. Out of the almost innumerable experiments which could be made in these plantations would come a vast fund of scientific data which has never been determined in the United States. Experiments are needed in wood preservation, especially for those species which are adapted for prairie planting yet do not last long when exposed to the elements, since it is in the prairie region that wood scarcity will always be felt most keenly and where there is a demand for the highest type of wood preservation. It would also be well to follow out the experiments already conducted on determining the efficiency of wind - breaks. In conclusion it may be stated that the principle aim of forestry in our state is to most fully utilize the land of least agricultural value. Such lands as are naturally poor in soil fertility and those subject to erosion or flooding become of first importance and a large amount of experimental work should be done on each of these types of land. When a forest crop is grown on soil well adapted for agriculture, it should be made to compete directly with the farm crop or should be grown over a small area because of its combined value for beauty, protection and </seg>

            <seg id="p177">177 TREE PLANTING HY THE GOVERNMENT. [•H1LLJP8, L'MVEBBITT OF \KMKASKA Only a few years ago tree planting was done in observing Arbor Day or by some farmer who wished to improve his lands or produce a small amount of supplies. As the natural timber supplies grew less and the possibility of a timber famine seemed imminent the government imme - diately began experiments in tree planting. From the slight beginning made in 1902 in Nebraska and southern California the work has been steadily carried forward until now nine nurseries have been established to supply the needed trees. The past year's work in government forest Chas been a truly noteworthy one and it may well be said that mole-hill efforts have grown to mountain size and bid fair to best results that have ever been secured by forest planting. Out in western Nebraska the government has its largest forest nur - sery. This is five acres in size and has a capacity of I la 7.000.t00 seedlings. These seedlings are to be used for planting over several thousand acres of treeless sandhill areas which have been set apart for the sole purpose of forest planting. It would seem to the casual ob - server that forest trees could never be grown over such areas, but the t'k has been a fair success and the growing of trees where there are signs of former tree growth becomes a thing of national importance. At the end of fourteen years' trial made on some of the poorest of these sands with the jack pine, which thrives naturally in the lake states, over 90 per cent were still alive and showed that they were remarkably adapted to thrive even under the most adverse conditions. The plantation contained 4.5:!0 trees to the acre, anil in the remarkably short time that they had been planted one-fourth of the trees averaged over nineteen feet in height, while one-half of the remainder had made a growth averaging sixteen feet in height. Even better results are ultimately to be expected from the government plantings, since forest conditions will be established over immense areas and the trees should make a more healthy, vigorous growth. A remarkable feature connected with tree planting in the sandhill region is that so far none of the plantations have suffered from insects or fungus diseases. One of the greatest needs demanding immediate attention is forest planting to protect and improve the watersheds of the country. Great floods with their consequent erosion of slopes and stream courses have already cost thousands of dollars and attracted the attention of Irriga - tion experts, water companies, city authorities and ranchers. It is the universal opinion that a good forest cover is the cheapest, most effective and longest-lived protective agent that can possibly be employed, but it demands experts to grow trees where trees have never grown before, or to replace a low, scrubby growth, which has little protective value, with 7 </seg>
            <seg id="p178">178 a dense stand of conifers or broad-leaved trees which will have the rotective value. A large proportion of our stream flow comes from nearby mountain areas which arc suitable only for growing forest and in nearly all cas&lt; s in the West are still held as government land. Many large cities do not own their own watersheds. They know, however, that in the spring they are besieged with floods and that valuable water is going to waste as well as damaging property, where valuable reservoirs are being badly silted to the extent of thousands of dollars annually. It is also well known that in the summer where there is the greatest demand for water there is the greatest scarcity. They are becJnnlDg to realize, too. the value of forest planting in regu - lating the water supply ami that if once a good stand of forest ■ ured and the proper management is given to the forested area more water will be available for their use than can possibly be attained otherwise. The government is most often the only agency that 1 liese lands the proper protection; moreover it has the only 1k)(]v of scientific men trained for the purpose of getting the best n out of this planting work. far the government work has been hailed with enthusiasm by dependent upon it. In Colorado a nursery has been established and planting begun to benefit the water supply for Colorado Springs. In southern California two nurseries have been started and planting begun to improve the watersheds of Pasedena. Los Angeles, San Bernardino, : &gt;i&lt;le, and Santa Barbara. In Utah similar work is being done for Lake City. In New Mexico such work is being done for Santa Fe and Las VapK, M well as the Military Hospital at Fort Bayard. In Idaho the decided needs of Pocatello and surrounding settlers are to l&gt;e supplied by a small forest nursery and extensive planting operations. The work is only at its beginning and within the next year or two examinations will lie made of every city watershed in the West where the flow is dependent ui&gt;on the condition of lands in National Foi When consi deration is given to the immense future growth that is bound to come to all cities in the West and the fact that already si of these cities are using all the available water supply, the work of ument planting and its consequent results can hardly be over- estimated But the government work doei watersheds.

The government nurseries are all run by competent, technical men and the growth of the trees until they are two or three years old Is given the utmost care. The trees are then set out in the hills or moun - tains at distances of 4 by 4 or I liy t; feet each way. They are carefully grown in the nursery, well set out in the mountains, and little subsequent care is needed except protection from fire and grazing. Except over the most favorable areas, this method of planting seedlings is better than nature's method in producing a forest stand. When it is known that such work can be done for an average of $3 to $8 per acre and that the mature timber is often worth from one to several hundred dollars per acre, the value of the work becomes apparent. In the most favorable areas such as exist in the Black Hills it seems probable, from the work already done, that the tree seeds may be planted by the use of corn planters or that they may be sown broadcast and that in a few years thousands of acres may be again producing forest. Within two years it is planned to plant from 1,000 to 2.000 acres per year with seedlings and an equal or greater amount by broadcasting seeds or sowing them with a corn planter, while in the near future the work must take on much greater proportions. The carrying out of this policy is not the work of a day or even a few years. A definite basis has already been established and it is fairly well known what trees are best suited for each locality. The results that Germany has taken several centuries to accomplish, the United States confidently expects to secure in a much shorter time. This means that the work must be kept at the lowest cost commensurate with good, profitable results, and that we must place our tree planting on a sound business basis as well as a sound scientific basis. Most of the countries of Europe and even large sections of our own country are already largely dependent upon planted forests for their supplies, and to the man who rightly understands our conditions only a little study is needed to show that government forest planting is one of the greatest works that is being done anywhere in the country. </seg>

Is scarcely a large railroad system that has not given the question consideration and some of these companies have made definite plans for such work. Numerous large land owners are following the excellent example of the railroads, while farmers in every state in the I'nion are working hard to supply the needs that have been forced upon them. The first factor that appeals to every man interested in the subject is the type of land and the best trees for the work. A clear under - standing of those treos which are best suited to a region and to each class of soil within that region will usually mean a profit to the tree Kter. A lack of success often occurs when men carelessly overlook points. Above all, tree planting demands as a basis good common sense and usually a willingness to wait for a few years or possibly several years before any financial returns are to be had. In other ways, however, tree plantations more than compensate for the time they take in order to become marketable. That is, they can usually be made on land un - suited for agricultural crops and, when started with no other Idea than commercial returns, they are still bound to improve the value of the property as well as adding materially to the protection and general beauty of the region. keen, observing farmer or other land owner can usually decide in the native trees which are best suited to the land he owns and the purposes he wishes to accomplish by forest planting. But just as there are experts in farming or in the growth of any crop so there are experts on tree planting. It is well known that each farm crop is best produced only under certain methods of planting, spacing, cultivation and harvesting. The greatest degree of success in raising any species of trees or any mixture of the various species also depends upon these factors, though to a more limited extent and requiring less care than that given to farm crops. The farmer because of his experience in farm crops is preeminently fitted for just such work as growing forest trees and making money out of them. E'e are numerous forest plantations in nearly every state which furnish object lessons to farmers and other land owners who o plant forest trees.

I1E88FT I was fortunate enough a few days ago to receive an invitation from the officers of the bureau of forestry to visit one of the forest reserves \:\ Nebraska. As is now generally known, two considerable tracts of land in Nebraska were set aside last spring by President Roosevelt for forestry - purposes. One of these is in Thomas county and extends from the Dismal river on the south to the middle Loup on the north. This one contains about 86,000 acres, and is called the "Dismal river forest reserve." The other reserve is in Cherry county, and extends from the Niobrara river on the north to the Snake river on the south. It contains about 126,000 acres, and bears the name of the "Niobrara forest reserve." There are thus about 212,000 acres of land in these two reserves — an area equal to about nine townships, or say about half of an ordinary county in eastern Nebraska. On both reserves there are some native trees growing along the rivers, but for the most part the country is a great rolling surface of sand hills. In fact it was the purpose of the forestry bureau as far as possible, to select only sand hill land for these reserves. Ten or eleven years ago the forestry bureau made an experimental planting in the sand hills of Holt county, and today the pine trees in that plot of ground are from sixteen to eighteen feet high, and growing vigorously. In fact these pines have grown faster than similar ones planted at about the same time right here at Lincoln. The result of this experiment has been another of the surprises that the sand hill country is in the habit of making from time to time. Few people had faith in the ability of the sand hills to grow pines, but no one who has seen this experiment now doubts that it is possible to make trees of this kind rwell in the hills. One good experiment like this is worth a great of theorizing. E Dismal river reserve is triangular in general outline, its western running south along section lines from near Thedford to the river where the line turns at a right angle and runs east for twenty miles, following the general course of the river. It then northwest, following the section lines along the middle Loup &gt; the starting point near Thedford. E village of Halsey. about midway on the diagonal side has been as the point near which to begin work. At this plare I was met Miller, who is in immediate charge of the work. We mount our and first fording the river, trot to tt-e camp two miles away at the </seg>

The latter are young fellows, all col lege graduates, who have entered the bureau of forestry after completing a course of scientific training We soon Klart out for a preliminary survey of the premises, stopping first at the nursery site. Here the ground has been cleared and pli and workmen are engaged in putting in the posts for the enclosun thicket of trees and shrul.s near by received a good deal of attention. since here in the space of a few rods no less than twenty-four different species of woody plants are growing naturally. This is in itself an indi- cation of the favorable location of the nursery. We then scramble up the bluff past indications of a couple of strong springs which are waiting to be opened for the use of workmen On the bluff we find that some rhave grown to the very top. Most of them have been cut by set - . who paid no attention to the fact that they were the property of There is evidence that some of the red cedar trees »et in thickness. There are now small red cedars on he gover were nearly two fe Hi*- hill Ahere they make a thrifty growth. On the bottom land close to the river we find a thicket of shrubs growing as rampantly as in New England. Here. too. we find a rank growth of ferns. In fact )t recollect to hav greater mass of ferns anywhere in Nebraska After dinne amp we get into a light buggy behind a span of government mules and drive directly into the sandhills. We follow no road or trail, in fact, there are none to follow. We go where we will. up hill and down. The surface is very irregular and broken, and the drive is one of the roughest that I have ever taken. We drive for manv miles over the hills, and through tfce valleys. At every point the ques- tion is asked whether trees will grow or not. It is noticed that although the hills are of sand alone, there is an abundance of moisture a short distance below the surface. Even in the 'blowouts' where the bare sand dry that it blows constantly, we had to dig not more than three or four inches in order to find sand so moist as to be easily squeezed into "forms- in the hand. Every grower of plants knows that such soil is moist enough to grow trees. Here and there we find clumps of hackberry trees, and in nearly every valley there are plum or cherry thickets. All over the hills we find innumerable low shrubs of the sand cherry, prairie willow and red root After a drive of fifteen miles we come to the river again and ride rapidly to Thedford. for the evening is cold, and besides we are very hungry Next morning we start early and drive southward along the western boundary of the reserve, following the traveled road. Here the surface is more closely sodded and the settlers are making hay from the rich grasses, which cover the surface. We drive into the reserve at a couple of points, and find the sod more open, and better adapted for tree plant- </seg>
            <seg id="p184">184 ing. The hills here are in distinct ranges with broad valleys between. We cross the hills through passes and then wind across the undulating valley. Here are thousands of cattle and we realize that we are in the region of the great cattle ranges. At noon we reach the Dismal river which we ford in our search for a convenient place for our noon camp. We find a spring at which we slake a prodigious thirst, and eat our luncheon, while Uncle Sam's mules are assimilating corn. We climb the bluffs on the south side of the river and get a view such as is seldom seen in Nebraska. Below us two hundred or more feet, is the Dismal river, bordered with veritable marshes; westward we look up the river, bordered for the whole distance with marshes like those near by: eastward, the picture is of a valley with bordering hills, while through it meanders the marshy river. North - ward are the sand-hills, ridge on ridge stretching away as far as the eye can reach. Thousands of cattle can be seen taking their slow course toward the river for water. It is a peaceful sight, but it is strange in this that no human habitations are to be seen. One can easily imagine himself in a country not yet inhabited by man. — these animals, the wild creatures of these great rolling hills and plains. Shortly after 1 o'clock we are again under way. We ford the river again, and drive for miles down its beautiful valley. We note the strong growth of trees on the river bottom and the bordering hillsides. Here again the red cedars are to be seen growing vigorously; and here also, the large trees have long since been cut and taken away. We ford again a few miles down the river and notice that the volume of water has perceptibly increased. These rivers of the "Loup system" are the most remarkable in North America, if not in the whole world. They flow from a sandhill country, which has a dry surface, and a limited rainfall. They have few tributaries, and in some cases none at all for a great many miles. They never run dry. and they never rise or have "freshets." If one gauges a stream like the Middle Loup, or the Dismal, at some point, and then goes down fifty miles or so, he will find that there is more water in it, even though it has received no tributaries in that distance. What is the secret of the Loup rivers? They are spring-fed streams. They receive practically no surface water. All the rain that falls in the sandhills is absorbed by the porous soil, and allowed to trickle down slowly to the lower and lesB pervious layers, where It appears in the form of numberless springs. This is the secret of the steady flow of the Loup rivers, of which the Dismal is perhaps the most remarkable. Down the river we go, at last obliged to leave the valley and drive over the bordering low hills. We keep along the southern edge of the reserve for its whole distance and at last pass its southeast corner. It is now late in the afternoon and we are tired, and hungry. We drive rapidly now, and by 7 o'clock come to the village of Dunning, where we find food and lodging. Here our present study of the Dismal rtrer forest reserve ends. We talk over what we have seen and discuss plans </seg>

IIKSSKY Ki'hat is this I hear about the forest reserve," said Senator Burkett braska. 'Are they actually planting trees in the sand hills, and do expert them to grow?" This opened a recent conversation, out of i plans soon materialized for a visit to the forest reserve. We are both busy men, and it was no small task to find a time when we could spare the time for the trip together. At last we "sot together." and one warm evening early in September took the evening train at Lincoln for the northwest. We noted the green and gold of the fields through which we passed, with the dark green masses of forest trees in the valleys and alout the farm buildings. If anybody in the east still doubts the possibility of covering eastern Nebraska with forests he has only to look at these thrifty groves and belts of planted trees between Lincoln and Seward to have his doubts dispelled. At the present rate of gro'.vth it will not l&gt;e Ions before Nebraska will have more trees than many an eastern state which was cut out of the forest, and where the destruction of the forest has con - tinued until now what once was forest is bare as a prairie, while here the prairie is being rapidly interspersed and partly overgrown wiih forest bolts and groves. Pay we go for hour after hour through one of the most fertile in the world And here is another thing at which the eastern would be astonished. The ordinary notion of the prairies is that are vast areas of flat and level land. Rut here we are passing through a country consisting of rounded hills and broad, winding valleys. The sky line is nowhere straight, but always consists of long, graceful curves, which sweep upward for miles to a "divide." and then downward to a meandering stream, the latter bordered with trees and hi; Darkness at length closes this succession of colored pictures, and then as the full moon rides over the changing landscape we feast our eyes upon the lights and shadows, while the cool breeze comforts us and makes us forget the blazing heat of the day. We draw our curtains and chat tan hour and then curl down for a couple of hours' sleep, pulling overcoats over us, for the air is now decidedly cool. The train is late, for on this road the freight traffic is heavy and every little while we are sidetracked to allow a heavily loaded train to rattle and rumble by At last, long after midnight, we are waked by </seg>

Scott, manager of the forest reserve, and Mr. Mast, Iiis deputy. We drive two miles across the river in a chilly and almost frosty air to the station house built on the reserve by the United States government. Here we lose no time in "turning in," and we sleep soundly until late in the morning. Breakfast over, we set out to see what is to be seen. Mr. Scott leads the way, followed by the senator, who wants to see how all the work is done. We look at samples of the pine cones from which the seed Is to be obtained, for it is the present policy of the forest service to plant pine trees almost exclusively, and then inspect the great nursery bed. where there are now growing about 3 young trees. The seeds are sown closely in drills in little beds from five to six feet wide. The beds are separated by narrow walks, which are a little lower than the general surface. Several acres are used in this way and the whole area is covered by a slat roof held up by posts set at frequent intervals. This method of growing in partial shade has been followed by most growers of pine and spruce trees, especially in the west, where the air is dry- It is a pretty sight to look through these nurseries with their millions of seedlings of different species, each with its particular shade of green to mark it from the rest. Here are trees enough to plant 2,000 acres of land. What a lot of men will have to work almost day and nighi next spring. We are told, however, that only about 1,111111.000 trees will be set out next year, the plan being to allow them to grow for another year before transplanting, as it is found that a larger per cent survive when older than when they are planted after but a year's growth. O the million trees to be planted next spring Too. 000 or 800,000 are to be put into this reserve, while the remainder will be sent to the Pike's Peak reserve in Colorado and the Black Hills reserve in South Dakota. Some also, will be sent to a government reserve in Kansas. This nursery is on the bench land near the Middle Loup river. Th" soil is sandy, with a deposit of loam over the surface. It seems weli adapted to the growth of pine trees, and for this reason the nurser has been enlarged each year until it is now the largest government fores nursery in the United States. We are told that it is to be further en larged in the spring. It costs about $1.25 per thousand to grow the seed lings to the point where they can be set out with the greatest probabilit. of their growing, namely, at about two years of age. It costs aboi' twice as much to set them in the sand hills, making a total cost of aboi • $3.75 per thousand by the time they are set out. and all the work done. E'e leave the nursery and climb the hills to see what has been don s in the way of planting. What are the sand hills, anyway? Ther&gt; 1 part of Nebraska which is so generally misunderstood as the san ' country. Quite generally it is supposed to be a kind of hilly deser iked dry sand, but this is entirely wrong. In the first place the gar ' Muntry is not a desert. It is richly covered with grasses and shrul . </seg>
            <seg id="p188">188 and of these the number of species is greater than in any other part of the state. P're stock has been kept out the grass grows from two to three gh all over the hills and one can walk scarcely ten paces any - without finding low shrubs of some species. Since the fires have ceased the shrubs have increased in number and size. The indications are that if we could keep out the fires and the cattle it would not be long before the whole of this country would be a great shrubbery, with forest trees springing up here and there in the more favorable places, probably covering the whole surface in the course of time. B_it the experiment is being made by the forest service of the United States of helping nature in the process of forestation. The northerly slope of these hills along the river valley has no doubt been covered with trees until within a few years. We found remnants of this fringe of trees in many places, and at one point found old stumps with tell-tale ax marks which show us how it is that these areas are now treeless. Timber thieves came into this region and cut the trees and hauled them away to be sold for fence posts and railway _ ties. And now the casual passerby thinks that these hills never had any trees upon them. The old trees are nearly all gone, but, thanks to the foresters who have un - dertaken the work, it will not be long before the foliage of the pines will again shade the soil of this region and cover their surfaces with a mass of solid green We scramble up the steep hillside, now and then exclaiming as we find a sturdy little pine tree not yet as high as the waving grasses. On one favored point we find a lot of trees ranging from one to three feet in height. In another season that point will begin to show the green of the trees overtopping the lighter green of the grasses. When once this planting begins to be visible from a distance we shall hear no more as to the impossibility of doing this work. When the traveller sees from the car window a mile away the tree covered slopes, all green with these planted pines, the fame of this Dismal river forest reserve will be spread abroad in the land. LWell, while I have been writing all this our little party has been push - its explorations back from the front ljne of hills. Over the top we go, only to drop down into one of the peculiar closed valleys of the sand hills. Here long furrows were plowed in the sod about six feet apart, and in the bottom of each one the little trees were set. The results of last spring's plantings show that 1-year-old seedlings are more difficult to transplant successfully than when they are older, and it is the in - tention of the foresters to plant only 2 and 3-year-olds hereafter. Yet in spite of this handicap if not another tree were to be set in the planted area the trees would cover the ground in ten or fifteen years. With the planting of older trees and the much larger per cent of successful transplanting the surface will probably be well covered in five or six years. </seg>
            <seg id="p189">189 the trees planted are now living. This means that from 300,000 to 400,000 trees are now growing up into little trees, which in a few years will begin to overtop the tall grasses and show us a young forest. Per - haps some one asks why the grass is not eradicated by plowing, or in some other way, forgetting that the native western grasses do not form a close sod, but grow in bunches, leaving little bare areas of soil between the bunches. Furthermore, it must not be forgotten that young pine trees like a little shade, and this is what is given by the waving grasses . This reserve is known officially as the Dismal river forest reserve. It contains 90,000 acres and lies between the Middle Loup river on the north and the Dismal river on the south in Thomas and Blaine counties in central Nebraska. It was set aside for forestry purposes in April, 1902, by President Roosevelt, on recommendation of the officers of the bureau of forestry, ami a number of Nebraskans who had investigated the matter and who believed that trees could be grown in the sand hills. The time since the inception of this work has been too short to warrant us in speaking too positively in regard to its final success, yet everything now points that way. When we remember that a small tract of less than one acre in the sand hills of Holt county planted with pines about four - teen years ago is now densely covered with trees which are from twenty to thirty feet high we need have no fears as to the outcome of the plant - ing in central Nebraska. It will surprise many readers of The Farmer to be told that the streams which flow from the said hills are all "spring streams"; that is, they are fed almost wholly by springs. One may travel along any of these rivers for miles and not find a single affluent. The cause of this is not hard to find. When rains fall the water at once sinks into the sand. None of it runs off, none of it evaporates, and in due time it reappears in the form of springs along the stream valleys. As a conse - quence the streams issuing from the sand hills are remarkable for the steadiness of their flow. They never dry up, they are never low, they are never high. There are many other interesting things connected with this sand hills country in general, and the forest reserve in particular, but I cannot take them up at this time. My party has been pushing on, and the sen - ator, gun in hand, is scrambling up and down the steep hills in pursuit of game. Of his prowess as a hunter and skill as a shot, of our visit to a prairie dog town in quest of dogs and owls, of a fast game of tennis at the close of the day, I cannot write now. F3ur visit has shown us that substantial progress has been made in itiug trees on this reserve, and it is time for us to return. We catch early morning train and speed away down the sloping valley, across the Platte river at Grand Island, through the thriving towns of Aurora, York and Seward, and reach home again m the evening. As we part we pledge each other to go again next year, when we promise ourselves a longer and more extended visit to this wonderfully interesting portion of our state, the great sand hills. </seg>

I1ESSET In studying the forest trees of the Great Plains of Central North America we find that most of the species have migrated out upon the Plains from the great forest body of the Mississippi Valley. These trees found their way upon the plains by way of the forests which border the Missouri River and iis tributaries. As we pass down the river along the eastern edge of the Plains the forest belt becomes larger and larger until it eventually merges into the great body of forest trees lying on the easterly side of the Mississippi Valley. The principal trees which have come upon the Plains by this route are the common Red Cedar, Pawpaw, half a dozen Willows, one Cottonwood. Basswood, three Elms, Hackberry, Mull.erry, three Ashes, wild Apple, four species of Hawthorn, June Berry, Wild Cherry, Choke Cherry, Wild Plum. Coffee Bean, Honey Locust, Red-bud, Sycamore, two species of Buckthorn, Buckeye, one Maple. Box - elder. Sumach, two species of Walnuts, five or six Hickories, nine or ten Oaks. Ironwood, Blue Beech, and one Birch. But ten species of trees have come from the Rocky Mountain forests, and these have made much less impression upon the forests of the Plains than those which came Ethp Eastern forests. In this list are the Bull Pine, the Western Cedar, four species of Cottonwood. the Buffalo Berrv. a Maple, and Birches. Eli hough the present forest area of the Plains is not relatively large, large enough to be seriously considered in regard to its preservation. e is danger that with the habits acquired by our people in the thickly wooded portions of the United States of cutting down forest trees wher - ever found, much of this small forest area will be destroyed. It is much easier to preserve an area of forest land than to create it anew. First, all forest fires must be kept down. Where a mass of woodland adjoins the open prairie, fire-guards should be made so that the fires will not sweep into the forest growth. The greatest destroyer of the forests of the Plains in the past has been fire as it swept over the prairies into the woodland. Second, it is absolutely necessary to keep out certain kinds of stock. Swine, if herded in large numbers, will inevitably destroy the trees. They prevent the growth of small trees, and eventually destroy those of larger growth. Cattle, in large numbers, are equally destructive. In fact, where the attempt is made to preserve uninjured the trees in a forest it is necessary to keep out stock of all kinds, excepting possibly during limited portions of the year. Third, it is necessary to cut out the trees for use with very great care. A forest should be a permanent crop. TREKS ON THK GREAT PLAINg </seg>

Care should he taken to encourape the tendency to spreading which is so strong in nearly all parts of the Plains. With a little care every present living forest area may be made to extend itself spontaneously, or nearly so. The forest should be effectively enclosed liy a fence placed at some distance from its outer border, leaving a belt of unoccupied land between the trees and the fence, mingled with these will be the w blown or carried from the forest forest will be gradually extended these enclosed belts of land, giving seedling trees.

Little if any cultivation need be given to such a nursery belt, as the weeds which spring up, while un - sightly will serve the useful purpose of sheltering the little trees, and eventually the trees will rise above, and choke them out. Grass, however, forming a tough so.1. is harmful to the little trees, far more so than the ordinary weeds. There are many places where actual planting must be resorted to. In looking about for a site for the new forest plantation, we must remember that the best conditions for tree growth are usually to 1m&gt; found near the natural forests. Where there are natural forests the planting should be around the lorders so as to extend them in much the same way as indicateii in the preceding paragraph in regard to natural spreading. Where there are no natural forests at all it is necessary to select the more favorable places for planting. Since the natural forests on the Plains occupy the depressions rather than the hill tops, or the slopes, this should give us a hint aa to what we must do. Wherever the land slopes into a depression one may find favorable conditions for growing trees. These depressions, generally called "draws." may be filled with trees, and when once a growth of a few acres is secured it will not be difficult to extend the forest far up the hill slopes. On the western por - tions of the Plains similar poFitions should be taken under the irrigation ditches. In the selection of trees for the formation of forest areas we should also take a hint from nature. The rule which is a very excellent tfor the plainsman to follow, is to plant on his farm the kinds which Inds in the nearest forest, and to e;ive his planted trees as nearly It the same conditions as those under which they grew in the re forest. On the eastern third of the Plains, the Walnut, White Shellbark Hickory. White Elm. Red Elm, Hackberry. White Ash Cherry, and Honey Locust are recommended for planting. On extreme eastern portions bordering the Missouri River, many more </seg>
            <seg id="p192">192 kinds can be planted, but as we pass westward toward the borders of the Sand Hill region the list grows smaller. On the Central Plains the list is reduced, and also somewhat changed in species. The two elms may be planted, as also the Hackberry, the Green Ash in place of the White Ash. Wild Cherry. Honey Locust, and in many places the Bull Pine. On the Western Plains, especially that portion lying west of the main body of the Sand Hills, and having an elevation above the sea of from 3,000 to 4,000 feet the list is still smaller. The White Elm is still included, also the Hackberry, the Bull Pine, and in many places the Red Cedar. The trees mentioned are of the more durable and profitable kinds. But on all parts of the Plains people must often have quick-growing trees which soon produce fuel, but which have little, if any, value for other purposes. In the eastern part of the Plains the Black Willow, Almond Willow. Common Cottonwood, Silver Maple, and Box-Elder are useful trees for this purpose. We should not condemn the use of these easily grown soft wooded trees. A forest is a crop, arid there is no reason why a farmer may not plant a more quickly growing crop if he wishes, but he should at the same time plant the more enduring kinds given in the preceding lists. On the central Plains the quickly grown trees may include the same Willows and Cottonwood and also the Box-Elder. The Silver Maple will not do well in the greater part of this central region. On the western Plains the list is essentially the same as for the central portion: namely, the Willow, Cottonwood. and the Box-Elder, to which may be added, here and there, one or more of the western species of Cottonwood. The species which are most largely used for windbreaks for orchards and other plantations are Common Cottonwood. Willow (a variety of Ralix alba), Silver Maple and Box-Elder. The first mentioned, because of its easy propagation, rapid growth and extreme hardiness is the favorite tree for this purpose. Pmt the country homes the first trees are usually Cottonwood, Silver and Box-Elder, followed later by Green Ash and White Elm. commonly the Red Cedar is planted with the first mentioned species, and often Scotch and Austrian pines are soon added. It must be remembered that the settler's house on the Plains stands in the open, instead of being hemmed in by forest trees as in the eastern portions of the American continent. The settler's problem is to surround his house with trees, not to clear the trees away. In the towns and cities the Cottonwood, Silver Maple and Box-Elder are generally the pioneer trees, since they produce a shade sooner than any others, and later these are gradually replaced by Green Ash and White Elm. Hackberry, Black Walnut and Sycamore are occasionally planted, with good success.

The coniferous trees of greatest value for ornamental purposes on the Plains are the Austrian Pine, Scotch Pine and Red Cedar. With proper care these may be grown on all parts of the Plains where water enough to maintain life may be obtained. On the extreme eastern border the Norway Spruce and even the Balsam Fir have proved valu - able. Among deciduous trees the White Elm holds first place, followed by the Hackberry (which is not as much planted as it deserves) and the Green Ash. </seg>

            <seg id="p195">195 SOME AMERICAN PLANTS ABROAD (From Proceedings Society for the Promotion of Agricultural Science.) BY CHAKI.KS K. I I may observe first that plants travel. Just as people travel, so plants travel about the world. Some of them travel with our help, as is the case with those which we have domesticated, and brought into cultivation upon our farms, and in our gardens. Others travel without any help purposely given by us. These are the weeds and noxious plants of various kinds. Again, some plants travel without any reference what- Again, some plants travel without any reference what ever to us There are many so abundantly provided with means for travel that they are able to pass from state to state, and from country to country with no help whatever from man. The thistles and thistle-like plants whose seeds are provided with downy appendages are good illustrations of plants of this kind. Then again, many of the smaller plants as the fungi whose spores are so minute that they are picked up by the winds and carried for long distances, are able to make their way from country to country with little or no difficulty at all. R During the past summer which I spent on the continent of Europe, as much interested in noticing that the common American weed known as horseweed ( Eriperun caum4enM») is very abundant throughout the whole region which I visited. It is found not only in Western Europe, but extends to long distances eastward into Russia and southward to the Caucasus Mountains. Even away beyond the Causasus in the region known as Trans-Caucasia these weeds are very abundant and I saw them growing under precisely the same conditions there as in the country. The sunflower as is well known is an American plant. Its native country is this very region in which we are living. Here it has grown wild for ages and yet this American plant, native of the prairies and plains of North America, is found abundantly in the old world. We have always despised it, regarding it as nothing but a weed. The Russian peasants, however, were much wiser than we, seeing in this rapid growing rampant plant possibilities which the American farmer over - looked. Here the Russian peasant took the wild sunflower of the plains and developed it into a plant of great value. He modified it so that the sunflower in Russia is no longer the many flowered plant that it is with us. His plant has but one immense flower head and there are no side branches to take away the nourishment which should go to this one great head. As a consequence the seeds instead of being the small size are from six to eight times as large as on the wild plant. These big seeds contain a large amount of valuable oil and also much nutrient matter. They are so nutritious that the peasants roast them as we roast </seg>
            <seg id="p196">196 peanuts and eat them precisely In the same way. Fowls and domestic animals are fed upon these seeds and the oil which is obtained by pres - sure is used in many lines of the Industries. Some of these cultivated sunflowers have escaped and in their half-wild state show a most interest - ing case of partial reversion to the form which they have here on our American plains. In passing by some of the farms I was repeatedly startled to see these sunflowers with so much of the Nebraska look upon them. They had developed side branches and these bore many much smaller flower heads. In fact it is possible that in time some of these escaped sunflowers of Russia wilj become weedy as our own wild species Is in Nebraska. Another plant which is distinctly American and which has traveled widely is our corn (maize). We think of this crop as especially and dis - tinctively an American crop, and boast about our great cornfields; yet I saw on both sides of the Caucasus Mountains fields which rival in size and in the development of the individual plants those of the best portions of Nebraska and Kansas. Some of these fields are a mile or more in length and contain hundreds of acres. It made one feel almost at home to find in this region the horseweed, the escaped sunflowers, and the great cornfields. But it was not my intention to speak at length of such plants as the foregoing. My attention was called to a number of American trees which have been introduced successfully into different parts of the old world. One of these which is the rarest is the "big tree" (Sequoia) which occurs in America in restricted patches on the westerly slope of the Sierra Nevada. These trees have been taken into many places in the old world and are found to thrive luxuriantly. In the botanical garden at Nikita in the Crimea I found large trees fully two feet in diameter at the base and from forty to sixty feet in height. These are growing with as much vigor and quite as rapidly as they would have grown had they remained Er original home in California. In the Alexander Park at Batum eastern end of the Black Sea I found several other fine specimens e beautiful American trees. The Monterey Cypress which grew originally in a very restricted area in California near the city of Monterey is now to be found in many places in Europe. I noticed some particularly fine specimens of this tree on the grounds of the Emperor's Gardens at Livadia and for miles south - west of Yalta in the Crimea. On these grounds also I noticed with much pleasure that one of the finest trees in the immediate vicinity of the Emperor's palace was an American walnut which had attained to large dimensions, and had developed a top of perfect symmetry. Without question this is one of the finest trees on these beautiful grounds. The Black Locust ( Robinia pseudacada) which is a native of the central portion of the United States is one of the most widely planted of American trees. In fact, it is one of the most commonly planted trees of any kind, whether American or European. I found that not only in </seg>
            <seg id="p197">197 I 'stern Europe but in practically every Russian city which I visited this one of the favorite trees, and in going southward across the steppes the Caucasus region and beyond this tree is planted everywhere. At ! watering place of Kislovodsk where the great Narzan springs are, the park is made up very largely of Black Locust trees. These must have been planted many years ago, for they have attained a gigantic size. At the city of Vladikavkaz near the Dariel Pass this is the common tree again, and across the mountains in the south country in the city of Tiflis and still further south at Erivan near the Persian border these Black Locusts are universally planted. When it is remembered that in these places the rainfall is frequently very deficient, the importance of this tree can be appreciated. In Odessa where the rainfall is very deficient indeed and where the soil is very sandy, I found that the Black Locust was grown because of its ability to endure drought. Apparently wherever the rainfall is deficient the Black Locust is the best tree for planting, and these people in the old world have not only made this discovery, but have profited by it. The Honey Locust, as is well known, is another American tree, and this has gone almost as far into the old world as the Black Locust. It Erently stands next to it in its ability to endure drought. We did not any place in our travels where the honey locust had not been intro- Another American tree which we are neglecting somewhat Is the Box Elder. Apparently th s people in Europe have a much higher opinion of it than we have. They have learned that it is a tree which will endure drought well and so it is planted abundantly. We found it wherever we went and in many places it was more commonly grown than it Is in t portion of the United States. I am told that it has been introduced le region east of the Caspian Sea as far east as Turkestan. In going abroad the traveler is at once made aware of the fact that the ivy is one of the beautiful things which attracts his attention. Wherever there are old walls or crumbling ruins the ivy takes possession and covers them with beautiful green masses. While in London I vis - ited Westminster Abbey and was quite astonished to find that much of what is taken for ivy on the walls is not ivy at all but our American Virginia Creeper. It is true that on the old Abbey the ivy is found abundantly, but with it and covering it and excelling it in the mass of green is the Virginia Creeper, the American climber common every place from the Rocky Mountains to the Atlantic Ocean. Many of the "ivy covered walls" of the old world are really "creeper covered walls." In Berlin in connection with some of the finest monuments and architectural structures we found not ivy but the Virginia Creeper. Its beautiful, rich, and abundant foliage makes it much more desirable than the ivy itself. At Warsaw, at Moscow, at Kislovodsk and Vladikavkaz, everywhere, we found the Virginia Creeper. Crossing the mountains into Trans-Caucasia we found 'hat here and there in the mountains this American plant had </seg>

Even in Erivan under the shadow of Mt. Ararat the American plant prows rampantly, covering walls and buildings and M with its magnificent foliage. At Batum on the Black Sea, in the Crimea and in Sevastopol everywhere we found this American plant. It is beyond question in the opinion of these people to be preferred to the ivy. in spite of the fact that in much of the country the ivy is com - mon as a wild plant in the forest. Before I leave the Virginia Creeper I wish to say that a close examination of many of the vines showed me that they are exactly as they are in this country. Some of them are good climbers, adhering to the walls by flattened disks, while others are pro - vided merely with little tendrils quite like those which are found on the wild grapes. Apparently no attention has been given to a selection of those which adhere best. The beauty of the vine is such that whether it is necessary to grow it upon a trellis or not it is regarded as of such superiority to all other vines that it is widely grown. As an Amer - ican 1 felt very proud of this beautiful climber as in fact I did of the fact that so many of our American plants have proved themselves to be h high value to the people of the old world. </seg>

IV UIAKM BESSKY Not Ions ago I ha&lt;l the prtrUac gardens and parks in different part abroad is constantly reminded of th gardens in not only the larger citi&lt; towns. In London.

It contains in the neighborhood of CM acres. Some portions of it are heavily covered with trees and it shrubs, others are sparsely covered with trees, and still other por consist of greensward without shrubs or trees. Here and tl as m Hyde Park. St. James's Park and Green Park are two much smaller parks, together aggregating rerhaps one hundred acres. These are not far from Buckingham Palace, the residence of the king, and ar dollars, and yet the sturdy Englishman would resent most fiercely any attempt to restrict o redact their area. Now add to these parks in the heart of the city the many parks In he suburbs. Richmond Park. Wimbledon, Kew. Chiswir] and masses of ornamental lowering planls.

When we consider that there are here in the heart of London nearly or perhaps quite lrtml acres of land set apart for park purposes we may realize how fully the people of this great city believe in open places for the benefit of the women and children and tired men. These parks If cut up into lots and sold would bring almost fabulous amounts of money How it has happened that the real estate agent has been kent from It his grimy hands upon these open places is more than I can tell.

            <seg id="p200">200 gating perhaps 2500 to 3000 acres, and we have some idea of what the great English city has done for its people. But this is not all. In the suburb of Kew are the Royal Botanical Gardens, known the world over as the Kew Gardens. Here on an area as large as a Nebraska farm are gathered all of the plants which can be made to grow under the care of the most skillful gardeners to be found in the kingdom. Here in the great Arboretum one may walk through a forest which if not primeval is as dense and wild as the primeval forest itself. Here one may find trees brought from America, from distant parts of Europe, from Asia, from India, and from Africa. Here are grown in profusion shrubs of all kinds from all climates and here under glass where the temperature and the moisture conditions are made to imitate as closely as possible the different climates, may be found tens of thou - sands of species of trees and shrubs and herbaceous plants, all labelled and named 80 that "he who runs may read." Here daily thousands of people walk through the great grounds, finding at once recreation and instruc - tion. Who can measure the value of these great gardens to the people who live In London itself. Add now to this the fact that from all parts of the world scientific men come to study the collections of plants which are brought together in the Kew Gardens. It is the Mecca of botanists the world over, and to this place sooner or later every systematic botanist must come in order to study the great treasures which for a century or two have been gathering in this place. In Berlin, the capital of Germany, an area of probably 500 acres is get aside under the name of the Thiergarten. and here again, as in London, the people swarm day and night walking through the paths under the shade of the great trees, lingering by the beautiful shrubbery and ad - miring the great beds of fine flowering plants. Here are found at Inter vals monuments, statues, and other architectural structures which com memorate the great deeds of the German people, and contribute in no small degree to the feeling of patriotism which is so prominent in the Fatherland. A mile away are the old botanical gardens, still in the densely built up portion of the city. Thirty or forty acres of ground are set apart here for trees and shrubs and plant-housos. Here I saw the greatest collection of cactuses to be found any place in the world Although the cactuses are American plants it is true nevertheless that if one wishes to study thoroughly these plants of America one can do so best by going to Berlin and making use of this unrivaled collection of living, growing plants. But this old garden has proved to be entirely too small, and within the last few ypars at the little suburb of Dahlem on the southwest edge of the city the government has set apart about 150 acres of land, and here a new botanical garden has been installed. Here one may even now find plants of all kinds from all countries and all climates.

            <seg id="p201">201 In Vienna, although the city is an ancient one, those in authority have Men to it that there are great areas left vacant (or breathing places for the public. One afternoon I visited the great Prater Park on the edge of the city, three miles Ions and from one-third to half a mile in width. Here are from COO to 80U acres of land, some of it open, forming meadows on which the children play, some of It in very dense forests, some of It covered with shrubs. Some portions of it have been treated very care - fully with the best development of landscape effects while others have been allowed to remain as nearly as possible in a natural state. I saw at least 50,000 people at the time of my visit, and on looking over the great crowds that had flocked here for recreation and rest, I questioned whether the number was not almost double this. What a park of this kind means to the great city I have not time here to discuss. It means at least life and health and enjoyment for tens of thousands, yes hundreds of thousands, of women and children and tired men, of all classes. Away across Central Europe in the land of the Czar is the old city of Moscow, the old capital city of all the Russias. Here I found a botanical garden belonging to the Agricultural Institute, which rivals anything to be found in America. The garden includes not only a great arboretum in which trees from all parts of the temperate zones are grown, but in addition the garden proper, where plots of herbaceous plants representing many of the botanical groups are planted and carefully studied. In con - nection with this garden is a large farm with fine buildings and modern improvements. Both garden and farm seem to be maintained for tin, purpose of instructing the people. Visitors are welcome here and the object-lesson which is before them cannot fail to be very beneficial to the farmers and the gardeners of this portion of Russia. LNow go south across the great steppes to the northern slopes of the icasus mountains. We leave the great cities of Europe and find our - selves in the region where there are only small cities, and towns of moderate size. We stop at Kislovodsk in the foothills on the northerly slope of the mountains. Here is a town of about 6000 inhabitants. It lies along the banks of the Knma river which flows down from the snowy summits of the mountains. Yet in this little city there is a fine old park, not situated as we might suppose, on the outskirts where the land (s cheap, but in the very heart of the town. Here are perhaps 100 acres of land covered with trees, most of which have been planted, and filled with paths and booths, public halls and playgrounds, and running through it is the roaring stream which adds greatly to the charm of the place. Here every night one may listen to the music furnished by one of the military bands. It is a cool, peaceful, restful place, and as one thinks that all this is in a little town in an out-of-the-way corner of tne world, he cannot help wishing that his own people in this enlightened land esteemed such things as highly as do these people.

            <seg id="p202">202 ♦ Dariel Pass, I found a city lying on a level plain. The city was founded by one of Ihe former rulers of Russia for the purpose of guarding thi pass, and yet here I found that the principal street was in the form of a delightful avenue. Down the tenter of the street had been planted a double row of trees, and between these an elevated walk had been built valk la perhaps two feel above the level of the street on each side. and la twenty to twenty-live fret in width. On a ho! day one may imagine how pleasant it is to walk down this avenue tin er the shade of the K hanging trees, and as ihe evening coolness &lt; jmes on this becomes attractive. At frequent intervals comfortable sea's have been provid&lt; d. and here the tired people come out and rent for an hour or two in the evening. Here the children play, running and shouting, and play &lt;mes as children will Rut this is not all. At the si.le of this same avenue are the city garden ::-.K from 50 lo 60 or To acres.

            <seg id="p203">203 tain restrictions, this is not intended as a public park in the ordinary sense, yet those who visit the grounds find here all the kinds of plants labelled correctly, so that such a visit becomes highly instructive Per - haps from ten to fifteen thousand different species of plants are grown out of doors on these interesting grounds. Then there are plant-houses, libraries, and collections of preserved botanical material. I was very - much surprised at the magnitude of the work which was under way in this botanical garden, and yet it must be remembered that this is al) in connection with a city no larger than our own metropolis of Omaha. Still further south. 1"" miles or more, on Hip plains of Southern Armenia, under the shadow of Mi. Ararat, is the little city of Erivan, containing about M.Mt people. It lies on the hot and dusty plains in the immediate vicinity of the great mountain The rainfall is probably not to exceed 10 inches a year. On the edge of the &lt;ity runs the river Zenga which flows from the mountain lake Sewanga many miles north - eastward. Nothing will grow here excepting under irrigation. The land is a dry and parched one; ani! yet in this city of Armenians. Turks. Grusians, and other non-European types we found in the center of the business portion of the city a park of considerable dimensions. It is true that it was not as beautiful a park as many that wp visited, but a park in a region of but ten inches of rainfall cannot rival the parks in London. Yet here was valuable hud set aside for this purpose anil what is more nsrii for a park. Around the park were gathered fhe hotels and thr larger business houses. Through it there ran the irrigating dit'-hes. and there were walks and seats in al.undance, and at night electric lights and music were provided; and here the people at the end of the hot gather to talk, to chat, to walk tip and down in the cool of the evening and to listen to the music. At Batum. a city of M,0M people, lying at the east end of the Black Sea. and until twen' ,-five years ago a Turkish city, we found parks which might well br held up as models for any American city of tonal size. Although so recently wrested from the Turk the city has made much progress in the development of its parks. In one portion we foun 1 many rare trees which we had not seen before. Here we found many American trees growing luxuriantly showing that the managers were men of educa - tion and broad training. Here too we found to our delight a botanical garden with hundreds of trees both native and foreign, all named in such a plain way that the ordinary visitor might gain much valuable in - formation in regard to them. Again we found walks and pools and statues and seats, all contributing to the comfort and enjoyment of the many visitors. Crossing the Black Sea from the east end to the west end. we reached the city of Odessa with its half million inhabitants. Herp one might well excuse the people for not giving attention to things like parks anil 1 o - tanical gardens, for this is the great mercantile city of Russia It lies </seg>
            <seg id="p204">204 rainfall, and yet along its sea front is a fine boulevard with walks and play-grounds where the children and the tired mothers gather day and night. A short distance away from this boulevard is Alexander Park of about 100 acres with a dense growth of forest trees and undershrubs, and here again as before seats and other conveniences are abundantly provided. One cannot go through these foreign parks without having it impressed upon him that the purpose of a park is to provide resting places and play-grounds for the tired people, while at the same time adding the element of beauty. Further down the coast in the suburbs of the city we found a row of parks, and here to our delight we found also a botanical garden, where the government under the direction of the University, is introducing large numbers of foreign plants, and labeling them so that those who visit the grounds may be instructed as well as amused. I need go no further with my illustrations. What I have said of the parks of these cities has been simply to bring the matter before you in order to emphasize the fact that in the cities ahroai. the making of parks and gardens is looked upon as one of the necessary things. We in America ought to imitate this good habit in the foreign cities. It is true that in America our largest cities have parks, but to a very great extent they are situated In the suburbs alone, and the very people who should have the opportunity of getting to them never reach them, while our smaller cities generally have no parks at all. And when we come to our town and villages what can we say? In these there are no places for the children and the women and the other tired people. Coming now to our own city of Lincoln, a city which has many thinus about it which are very attractive, one is made to drop his head in shame that we have no parks. It is true that four blocks of land, be - tween D and F and nth and 8th streets were once set apart and labeled "City Park." but it is really little more than a "common," for in it cattle and horses and swine are permitted to roam almost at will. For years this has been a reproach to the city. All that is good in it we owe to the private efforts of the public spirited women of the city, and yet year by year their efforts have been largely negatived by the utter lack of public spirit shown by city officials. This little tract of land was orig - inally not fitted for park purposes, and yet it has been made less useful by its absolute neglect. We must preach a reformation. It is not to our credit that this city has no breathing place. We must have not one alone but several public grounds where children may play, where people may gather, where they may sit and rest in the cool evenings following the hot summer days. Why can we not set aside in the Antelope Valley a tract of land on which we may erect a proper Lincoln Park worthy of our city? Such a park would be central, such a park would be visited by the great ma - jority of the people of the city. Is it not worth our while to consider matters of this kind? [Since writing this a lteginning has been made </seg>
            <seg id="p205">205 of a park in the place suggested. It now remains for us to support it loyally with our words of approval and our money.] Finally, is it too much to hope that within a short time the University may establish a botanical garden where may be gathered all the native plants of the state, all the plants which may be made to grow in this region, wheTe every plant grown shall be labeled so that the visitor as he passes through the garden may learn not only the name but tbe history of the plant as well. Such a garden may be a place of beauty and of interest and at the same time it may have a high educational value for all the people of the state. [And here again, a fine beginning has been made at the State Farm, so that already it is becoming "the prettiest place at Lincoln."] </seg>
            <seg id="p206">206 OLD \\ OSLD CONTRIBUTIONS TO WESTERN ORCHARDS. I From Proceedings Society for the Promotion cf Agricultural Science.) I!Y CIIABI.ES E. UKSSl V I shall assume that by "Western Orchards" our president in assigning Ilia topic, means the orchards of the region of the "Great Plains." as I am not sufficiently familiar with the orchards of the regions still further to the westward to warrant any attempt to treat of them in this paper. Nor am I sufficiently acquainted with the northern Great Plains, as they stretch away for a thousand miles through the Dakotas. across the international boundary line to the far-away plains of the iichfwan. and I am equally unacquainted with the vast territory which runs southward another thousand miles to the Rio Grande River and across the border again. I do however, know something of the orchards of that portion of the Plains which lies between the Niobrara River on the north, and the Republican River on the south, and it is Lthis that I have written. This paper should therefore be interpreted dealing only with the otchards of the Central Great Plains, and such uld have been its title. In the region to which I have restricted my paper, five fruits con - stitute the list of those which make up the orchards. They are the Apple, Pear. Peach. Cherry, and Plum. It is true that now and then other tree fruits are grown, but not commonly enough to warrant their notice in this paper. THE APPLE ■ apples of the Central Plains may be referred to three or four species, as follows: Haibt Wiu Arri.K iPini/f mains L). — Leaves ovate or elliptical, crenate, more or less hairy, as are the twigs also: flower-stalk and calvx white-woolly: fruit longer than its stalk, larger than the preceding, from sour to sweet. Two quite well marked wild varieties are commonly rec - ognized as follows. Var. rlasyphylla, a tree of moderate size with horizontal branches, bearing large leaves (?, to 4 inches long and 2 to 2Vi broad). Native of the Orient. f.'ar. pumila. a shrub or small tree, native of southeast Russia, the t-asus. Tartary. etc. From this variety have come the dwarf apples »n as Paratlisc and Domain apples, so frequently used by propagators dwarfing the larger cultivated sorts. This species with its varieties appears to have given rise to most of the cultivated apples of the world. It is doubtful whether P stria. </seg>
            <seg id="p207">207 the smooth wild apple of Central Europe, should be kept distinct from /'. malus. They appear to freely intercross and produce gradations from one type to the other. The cultivated varieties, as the Baldwin, Jonathan. Bin Davis, Grimes' Golden, are what the botanist calls "horticultural varieties. ' which differ from varieties in the botanical sense by being less stable. A botanical variety will reproduce itself from seed, but these ■horticultural varieties' will not do so. And yet the two differ only in degree, not in kind. The horticultural variety is a slight temporary variation which will easily lose its identity, while the botanical variety is the same in kind, but with such stability that it reproduces itself year by year from the The extremely variable character of this species may !»• Inferred from the st&lt;m-ment made by Professor Bailey, that the horticultural varied* undoubtedly rearh four or five thousand. Downing gi\- .(ions of 1900 varieties, and the American Pomological Society's list includes S6t. On the Central Plains about fifty of these varieties are of direct interest Now while the original spe;-ies from which our apples are derived came from the Old World, it is a remarkable fact that all but seven of our varieties originated in the I'nited States. Of the twenty-one varie recommended by the Nebraska State Horticultural Society for general planting but one, — the Duchess. — is directly of foreign origin. The re- maining varieties originated as follows: "America." 3; the Carolinas Connecticut. 1: Illinois, 2; Iowa. 1; Kentucky. 1; Maine. 1: Massachusetts. 1; Minnesota. 1: New Jersey. 2; New York. 2; Virginia. 2; an 1 Wis 1. In the list of those recommend*! for trial (2" in number I we tind four from the Old World, viz.: Russia. 2; France.

I; Kentucky. 1: Massachusetts, 2: Nebraska. 1: New York, Pennsylvania, 2; Virginia. 1: Wisconsin. 1; with "Doubtful." 2. but pretty certainly of American origin. Of those recently tried and now placed on the list of discarded varieties, there are nine, as follows: Russia. 1; England 1; "America, 1 1: Missouri. 1: New York. 2: Ohio. 1; Rhode Island. 1; and Wisconsin, 1 Lam Sihkkian ai'i-i i: IPinu prunifolia Willd.l. — Leaves ovate, elon- gated or elliptical, smooth below, on long petioles; flower-stalk and calyx hairy or smooth; fruit wax-yellow, to red and even black, 1 to 14 inches or more in diameter, stalk about as long or longer. A tree to M feet high, native of northern China. Tartary, and southern Siberia This is the parent form of the larger cultivated crab apple, such as the Transit 1 &gt;i 'lent. Hp$lop, etc. In speaking of these varieties Professor Bailey says in his article I Pyrus I in the third volume of the Cyclopedia of American Horticulture. "These types tween Pyrus malus and P. baccata. of crabs are no doubt hybri' 1 They are often referred to P prunifolia which is apparently a derivative of P. malus and P. bao-ata through hybridization. " I am however of the opinion that at the present </seg>
            <seg id="p208">208 time the type before us is sufficiently distinct to be accorded specific rank. tHere again it is interesting to notice that the two varieties recom - ided (Whitney No. 20, and Florence) are of American origin. Small Siberian Apple (Pints bavcata L.). — Leaves elongated-ovate, smooth, as are the twigs also; flower-stalk and salyx smooth; fruit small, 1-3 to 3-4 inch, yellow or red, on a much longer slender stalk (1 to 1^. inches). A tree 25 to 30 feet high, native of the Himalayas, Amur, China, and Siberia. This is the parent form of the smaller cultivated crab apples, as the Red Siberian Crab, etc. LThe variety of this species which is sometimes grown on the Central ins (Red Siberian) is of Old World origin. Prairie Apple (Piru* ioensit (Wood) Bailey). — Leaves elliptic-oblong to ovate-oblong, irregularly and obtusely toothed; twigs and under surface of leaves white-woolly; flowers on white-woolly pedicels; ripe fruit de - pressed-globose, yellow-green, 1 to 2 inches in diameter. A shrub or tree like preceding. Native of the Mississippi valley. This wild species may not properly come within the limits of this paper, but as Professor Bailey regards it as one of the parents of the "Soulard Crab" it is entitled to mention. According to the author just cited the Soulard Crab, which is grown to some extent on the Central Plains, is a "natural hybrid of P. malus and P. ioensis. " If this view be the correct one then in the crab apple in question we have an American hybrid in which one of the parents is of European origin. I have myself been inclined to think that the Soulard Crab is a derivative from the Prairie Apple, but must defer to the opinion of the eminent authority just quoted. Although worthy of being used as a basis for improvement by a pro - cess of judicious breeding very little has been done in this direction. THE PEAR. But one species is concerned in the varieties of this fruit as grown on the Central Plains. It is described as follows by Professor Bailey in the Cyclopedia of American Horticulture: Common Pear (Pirut rommunis L.). — Strong upright tree,. living to a great age and sometimes attaining a height of seventy-five feet, the ped - icels and sometimes the young growth pubescent, but all parts becoming glabrous; leaves mostly oblong-ovate, with a prominent point, hard in texture and veiny, bright green, the serratures small and much appressed and obtuse, or sometimes the leaf is almost entire; flowers in umbel-like clusters on slender (2 to 3 inches) pedicels, white, appearing with the leaves; calyx persistent; fruit very various under cultivation, usually tapering to the stem, the flesh generally with gritty concretions. Native to southern Europe and Asia, where it has been cultivated from the earli - est times. — Probably indigenous as far east as Kashmir." the Plains proper, but few pears are grown, but of the half dozen ieties most successfully grown fully one-half are of American origin. </seg>
            <seg id="p209">209 THE PEACH E.ch (Prunus perxiva (L.) Seib. and Zucc). — A small or medium - tree, with upright branches, bearing smooth, dark-green, oblong - •al, or oblong-lanceolate, finely serrated leaves, which are from three to six inches long and one to one and a half inches wide; flowers rose - red; fruit globose, velvety-hairy (or, by cultivation, smooth) with a thick, soft flesh; stone large, turgid, very hard, deeply wrinkled. Probably a native of some part of China. Under cultivation many varieties have been produced, falling under the two marked races of clingstones and freestones, and each of these is divided again by the color of the flesh into the white and the yellow kinds. The Chinese flat peach, of which we hear occasionally under the name of Prunus platyiarpa. I have regarded as no more than a montrous variety, in which opinion I am sustained by Professor Bailey. The Nectarine, which is now considered to be a marued variation from the normal type of the peach, has a smooth, plum-like skin, but is other - wise quite like the peach; in fact it is said that Nectarines have been known to grow from peach seeds. About a dozen varieties of the Peach, the majority of American origin, are commonly grown on the Central Plains. Of these there originated in the Old World (England) 2; in Illinois, 1; Maryland, 1; Massachusetts, 1; New York, 2; Ohio, 1; while the origin of the remainder is unknown. THE PLUM. E'en or twelve varieties of plums are commonly grown in the orchards le central Plains. These are derived from no less than four original ies, but one of which is European, as follows: Common Plum (Prunus domestica L.). — A moderate-sized tree, with thin, smooth, elliptical, or oblong-elliptical leaves, which are one and a half to three inches long and half as wide; flowers one to several in a cluster, greenish-white, appearing with the leaves; fruit blue-black, globose, elongated, an inch or more in diameter, with soft, yellowish, sweet flesh, containing a flattened, sharp-edged stone. Native country not certainly known, but probably Asia Minor. Among the many varieties of this species now grown in the eastern United States the following are given by Professor Bailey: Lombard. Bavay Green Gage, Bradshaw or Niagara, Coe's Golden Drop or Silver Prune, French and Shropshire Damsons, German Prune, Fellenberg. Gueii, Ere's Arctic. Green Gage, Prune d'Agen, Hungarian Prune. Copper, trson, Imperial Gage. Quackenboe, Yellow Egg. Washington, and French Of the foregoing the Blue Damson, Lombard, German Prune, Imperial Gage, and Bradshaw are grown on the Plains. Two at least of these. — the Lombard, and Imperial Gage, — are of American origin, and it is probable that the Bradshaw also must be added to the list of American •varieties, leaving: but two which are directly of European origin 8 </seg>
            <seg id="p210">210 t Common Wild Plum (Prunus americana Marsh.). — A small tree, with il or slightly obovate leaves, the leaf -stalks without glands; calyx-lobes entire; fruit globose, one inch or less in diameter, with a tough, thick, red skin, and yellow flesh; stone turgid. It is a native of New York, New Jersey, and Florida to Montana, Colo - rado and New Mexico. In Nebraska it is found in a wild condition in every part of the state. This species has been very prolific rn cultivated varieties. The follow - ing varieties may be referred to this species: De Soto, Itaska, Forest Garden. Louisa, Minnetonka, Cheney, Deep Creek, Kickapoo, and Forest Of these the Forest Garden variety Is commonly grown on the Plains. Canada Plum (Frunus nigra Alton). — A small tree, with broadly oblong-ovate, to obovate leaves, the leaf stalks bearing two glands; calyx - lobes glandular-serrate; fruit oblong-oval, one to one and a quarter inches long, with a tough, thick, orange-red skin, and yellow flesh;' stone com - pressed. Found wild in Canada from Newfoundland to the Assiniboin river, and probably in the northern portion of the United States. Since this species has been confused with the preceding one it is difficult to say what cultivated varieties have sprung from it. Professor Sargent says in the Silva of North America: "Some attention has been paid in Canada to selecting the best wild varieties for cultivation. Va - rieties of this species are propagated and sold by nurserymen in some of the western states, and to it can be referred the well known Purple Vosemite, Quaker, and Weaver plums." K least two of these, — Quaker and Weaver, — originated in Iowa, &gt;- well be regarded as adapted for growth on some portions of ral Plains. Wiui Qoms Pun {Primus hortulana Bailey). — A small tree, with ovate-lanceolate haves, the leaf-stalks bearing glands; calyx-lobes gland - ular-serrate; fruit globose, two-thirds of an inch in diameter, with a thick red or yellow skin and hard, thin flesh; stone turgid. Native of Ihe Mississippi valley from central Illinois southward. The cultivated varieties referred to this species by Professor Bailey are Wild Goose. Golden Beauty, Missouri Apricot, Moreman, Reed, Rou - lette, Wayland. and Miner, and of these the Miner, and Wild Goose varie - ties are very commonly grown on the Plains. Both of these are reputed to have originated in Tennessee. Chick.vsaw Pi.um {Primus angustifolia Marsh.). — A small tree, with lanceolate to oblong-lanceolate leaves, the leaf-stalks bearing two glands; calyx-lobes glandular-ciliate; fruit globose, half an inch in diameter, with a thin red skin and juicy yellow flesh; stone turgid. This is apparently a native of the western or southwestern portion of the southern states, but it is not certainly known in a wild state. The cultivated varieties of this species are given by Professor Bailey as Newman, Arkansas — Lombard, Caddo Chief, Lone Star, Jennie Lucas, </seg>
            <seg id="p211">211 Pottawattamie and Robinson, of which the Pottawattamie, said u&gt; have originated in Tennessee, is In common cultivation on the Plains. THE CHERRY At least three species have to do with the cherries of the orchard* of the Central Plains. Moreti-o Cherry IPrunus cerasus L..). — A small tree, with ohovate or lanceolate-ovate, serrated, smooth leaves: cherries large, globose, red or dark red, the juice watery and not stainincr. with a sour taste. Probably a native of Asia Minor and adjacent parts of Europe. Now grown In most temperate climates. From this species there have been derived by cultivation many va - rieties, among which are the following: English Morello. Early Richmond (known also as Kentish), Ostheim, and Wragg, which constitute the list of those recommended by the Nebraska State Harticultural Society for general planting. AH of these but the last named are of European origin. Three others, — Dyehonse. Terry, and Early Morello. — are suggested for trial, the first and second of American, and the third of European origin. MxzzARn Ctierry (Prvnus avium L.). — A large tree, with large oval - lancsolate serrated leaves, which are somewhat hairy beneath: cherries som&lt; what heart-shaped, small and black-pnrple In the wild state, bat large In the cultivated varieties: Juice usually staining dark, of a »we«t taste. In the wild state this Is a native of Europe and western Asia, but now planted fn many temperate regions. Horticulturists recognize three races of cherries which have apparently sprung from this species, as follows: Heart Cherries. — Flesh tender and sweet, often dark colored: tree large, of rapid growth: leaves large, and of soft texture.— f Examples are Black Eagle. Black Tartarian, Downer. Coe's Transparent, etc., of which the first and second are of European origin, while the third originated In Massachusetts, and the fourth In Connecticut. 1 None of these cherries are commonly grown on the Central Plains. Binnrrrnu Cherries. — Flesh firmer, sweet, often light colored: tree large, of rapid growth: leaves large, and of soft texture — (Examples are Napoleon. Yellow Spanish. Windsor, etc.. of which the first and second are of European origin th? third originating In Canada.) None of these cherries are commonly grown on the Central Plains. Thike Cherries. — Flesh firm, sweet or sub-acid, light colored: tree large, of rapid growth: leaves large, firm, deep gre'en. — Though considerably different from the Heart and Bigarreau cherries the Dukes are still to be regarded as related to them more closelv than to the Morellos. Common varieties of the Dukes are May Duke. Royal Duke, Late Duke. Relne Kense, Belle Magniflque. etc.. all of which are of European origin. ■ are commonly grown on the Central Plains. Maimt.rb Cherrt (Prunus mahaleh L,.). — A small tree with small, oval </seg>

SUMMARY Summing up the foregoing we may say that in discussing the orchards of the Central Plains we have to do with fourteen original species, of which nine are of Old World origin, while five are American. Yet of the one hundred and five varieties noticed in this paper, but twenty-nine originated in the Old World, as against seventy-one in America, with five whose origin are not known. Apparently we are still very dependent upon the Old World for species of orchard trees upon which to base our work of breeding, but in spite of this about seven-tenths of the varieties, — that the results of breeding, — are of American origin </seg>

I One who has not been upon the Great Plains in the early winter, after the autumn frosts have changed the prevailing green of the landscape. can have little conception of the variety of the colors which meet the eye. These include several shades of red, two or more of orange, one or more of yellow, two of green, a dark blue, a purple, several browns and blacks, and many grays. With a little practice the eye can distinguish from twenty to twenty-five shades of color, sometimes blending into one another almost insensibly, or standing out in marked contrast upon the landscape picture It does not require long study to show that so far as the natural vege- tation is concerned these colors conform to the distribution of the various plant formations, and that we have here a natural color-scheme in which the plant formations are mapped on the landscape. Let me attempt to reproduce some of the color pictures I have seen. First, give the picture a general gray tone, which may include the sky as well as the earth surface. In the background, where the hills slope away to the horizon are great patches of dull red or purple, bordered by the silvery gray of the Buffalo Grasi by the silvery gray of the Buffalo Gras: stretch of light yellow marking the ar iss. Here in the fareground may be a Here in the fareground may be a stretch of light yellow marking the ar area of a field of corn (Maize) stalks ■a of a field of corn (Maize) stalks still stanclinir where they grew, and still standing where they grew, and id there may be a sray, velvet-like there may be a gray, velvet-like meadow of Buffalo Grass, with dashes meadow of Buffalo Grass, with dashei surface where the bunch gras- les of brick-red now and then on its of brick-red now and then on Its surface where the bunch jiras- and. or where the red stems of the and. or where the red stems of the knotwecds mark tht winding course of a "draw.'

In the distance, where a w tream winds Its way along, is a black line of cottonwood trees, whose trunks and larger branches show black against the gray background, and on nearer approach we note the silvery sheen of their twigs contrasting with their dark stems run! branches. A plum thicket in a ravine forms a dark-blut patch, with a background of dull red knotweeus, or bunch grass, further baik shading into the silvery gray of the Buffalo Grass. Now we see a silvery gray meadow of Buffalo Grass with faint patches of reddish color scattered over it: back of it a fringe of cottonwood and </seg>
            <seg id="p214">214 E elder trees with dark trunks, the latter loaded with their light brown ts, and still back of these the slopes with alternating silvery gray patches of Buffalo Grass and the dull red of the bunch grasses, running up to the sky line of light ochre where a field of maize is still standing. To complete this picture add a few stacks of alfalfa, now dark brown or black, and a spectral windmill here and there outlined in sombre colors. Allow me to show you one more picture seen near Minden, under the ninety-ninth meridian. Here is a little valley framed in with a brick-red border of bunch grass which grew on its sloping sides; next to it are patches of yellow Switch grass and silvery gray Buffalo grass and a rich, velvety maroon spot where the ripe fruits of the smooth sumach give their color to the scene. The floor of the valley Is covered with the red knot - weed, whose red is deepened in a central strip to a rich purple red where a watercourse had encouraged the taller red-stemmed Polygonums to -grow. I need not attempt to place before you more of these general views. In all cases the picture has a basis of gray, and on this are laid reds, yellows, blues, purples, browns, and blacks, etc. Let us inquire as to the meaning of these strips and patches of color. When the autumn drought and the early winter frosts stop the growth of vegetation the green shades of summer, themselves by no means uni - form, are replaced by the hues indicated in the preceding paragraphs. The practiced eye cat! distinguish the plant formations on the open plains by their shades of green when the vegetation is in its vigor, and it ap - pears that the early winter coloration is In a measure related to this fact. The boundaries of the formations are more sharply defined In the early winter, since the color differences are then emphasized. T have not. however, been able to determine any law of color change in the plants of different formations, in fact it appears that each plant is a law unto itself. Thus the light green of the low Butich Grass (Androporton sropa - rius~\ gives place to a red. as does also the still lighter green of the Tall Knotweed (Polygnnum ramogixximum). while the nearly similar pale green of the Buffalo Grass (Bulhilis dactylnides) turns to a silvery gray. On the other hand the richer green of the Switch Grass (Panicum virpa - turn) turns to a red orange below and a light yellow above and the dark green of Stinkweed IBoehera pappose as seen in the summer Is replaced In early winter by a pronounced brick red. Yet in the midst of these changes the clumps of Dagger Weed (T*0M glaurai and the bunches of cactus (Opuntia »p) retain their green color.— and in fact are the only green things In the landscape. I may summarize the facts as far as I have observed them by group - ing the plants under the colors they assume, as follows: RED. BrveH Grasses ( Androponon fvrratux. and A. xcopariut ) . The first (Tall Bunch Grass) Is sometimes of a rich orange-red running to dull red, and the second (Low Bunch Grass) is from brownish red to brick </seg>

BE88ET E'hen a boy in northern Ohio I vised to drive to the country mill several bags of wheat to have it ground into flour. The miller got his pay by "taking toll": that is by retaining for himself a portion of the grain. Now and then my father looked at the flour, the bran, and the middlings somewhat ruefully, wondering at the size of the toll that had been taken out, whereby the ten bushels seemed to have shrunken most extraordinarily. And it was a common belief that now and then the miller took toll more than once, thereby enriching his pockets more than the law allowed, to the great detriment of the customer who had no other recourse than to grumble and complain. This we did. you may be sure and we took pains to spread our disbelief in the absolute honesty of the miller. And no doubt there was a sood deal °f tnis kind of cheat - ing in those days ("graft" we should call it today). Here and there were honest millers, no doubt, and I like to think of one pleasant, somewhat plump, good-natured man as one of the honest millers. He used to talk to me very nicely, and made me feel more comfortable than most grown men did: for I was only a shy little boy from a farm several miles away from the village, and I was quite abashed when most men talked to me. But this miller. — my honest miller, — made me feel comfortable as he chatted with me while his mill clattered on, slowly grinding the grain I had brought. Yes I believe that there were millers who took an honest toll in thope davs of the coimtry mills. But I sat clown to write about a toll taker that is not so honest in his dealings with the farmer This one takes toll from every crop, and does it with a lavish hand and a large measure. Year by year the farmer suffers this loss, and sets no good, no service of any kind in return. In dealing with the dishonest miller at any rate we had our grain ground into flour. He did something for us. if he did take large pay for it. But the iceeris in a man's fields take toll from the crops and Bder no service whatever in return. They take from the crop and do hing in the way of recompense. This is not a fanciful way of putting it. but it is strictly in accordance with the facts. A man sows a field with grain of some kind, and the weeds come in and choke the crop so that it is reduced ten. twenty, thirty or more per cent. I hare seen grain fields in which the weeds so choked the grain that it was less than half a crop. No miller ever dared to take as heavy a toll as that, you may be sure. He would hare </seg>
            <seg id="p218">218 been run out of the country by the indignant farmers. And yet they tolerate the weeds. Again. I have seen a man plant a fine field with corn, and into it have come the rag weeds that so far overtopped the corn as to shade it from the health-giving sun. They took heavy toll, and with the rag weeds have come in the cocklebur taking toll of the corn, and not con - tent with this "graft." laying hands upon the stock and tying up manes and tails fn knotted masses that only hours of labor could remove. Nor must I forget the "Spanish needles." all too common in corn fields, taking toll of the crop by reducing its yield, and then adding not a little to thp farmer's work when he tries to rid his clothes of the tightly adherent seeds: nor the heartsease and smart-weed that steal the water from the roots of the corn and thus reduce the yield. They are all toll - takers, and the toll they take Is often very heavy indeed. It is not too mnch to say that in ordinary seasons (excluding the excessively wet and the excessively dry ones') the crop shortage Is almost wholly due to what the weeds have stolen from the crop. — to the excessive toll taken efo it is In the hav fields where weeds often choke out tne hay d thus reduce Its amount, and at the same time add a had tasting ■ latarle or unwholesome element. Who has not seen a crop of n filled with bitter weeds as to make It nearly useless for forage? And even such a crop as clover or alfilfa is not always free from these injurious intruders. "Weedv hay" will not brine as good a price In the markets as hay that is free from admixture with these unwelcome pests, and the difference is the toll naid them by the farmer.

They exact it of us every year, and the amount of money that is lost annually will reach many millions for the whole country, — hundreds of thousands for the state, — and tens and hundreds of dollars for most farms. It is a heavy toll, and the worst of it is that the farmer gets no return for it. It is a heavy toll for the great industry of agriculture to bear. It is one that should be reduced by every possible means. — by eradication, — -by better farm methods, — by better culture,— by the sowing of pure seeds, — and by the enactment of laws requiring that only purp seeds may be sold.

            <seg id="p220">220 THE PLACE OF DARWIN IN .MODERN THOUGHT. (From The Nebraskan.) BY CHARLES E. BE88EY. In the world's history it has occurred again and again that there was need of "a voice in the wilderness," and it was so when Darwin came and began to cry in the biological wilderness of the middle of the nine - teenth century. Like the other great biologist, Linne, who was born a century earlier, Darwin's great work was not some notable contribution to the anatomy, the physiology or the taxonomy of any group of plants or animals, but it consisted in putting biological science upon a new plane, a higher plane than that which it had occupied before. As Linne gave to biology a comprehensible taxonomy which made it possible for separated workers intelligently and accurately to communicate and com - pare their results, so Darwin made possible a taxonomy which involves phylogeny. Linne's classification was easily understood and easily ap - plied, and this was its great merit. It saved the time of the biologist but It did not, nor indeed was it intended to give any clue as to the real relationships of plants and animals. Darwin's work made necessary the introduction of the idea of relationship in classification. I It may be asked "what may all this mean for the ordinary student the University?" It is granted that for the student in Botany and logy Darwin's work is of high importance, but on what ground may eral students claim an interest in Darwin's accomplishments? I am so fortunate as to have seen something of the time preceding Darwin's famous publications. I saw with my own eyes the conflict between the old and the new ideas: the old and the new philosophy of the world. It is worth while living through that period, for it allowed me to see the fierce onslaught of the long continued battle, the dogged resistance, the repulse, the retreat and finally the complete rout of the attacking forces. It quickens my pulse today as I look back to those years when the battle was still raging. I was personally so fortunate as to be a student in a college where to espouse the new doctrine of evolution was not considered a sign of moral depravity. In fact as nearly as I can make out all of the members of the faculty were evolutionists. So we were free to become evolutionists if we felt so inclined. But in many colleges of that period the doctrine of evolution could not be taught, and I know of one State University in one of our neighboring states in which professors and students who were suspected of harboring such heretical notions were discriminated against and made the subject of denunciatory chapel harangues. Thought was not free in most of the colleges of tha </seg>
            <seg id="p221">221 period. The student today can not realize what a change has been wrought. The battle so bravely waged by the Darwinians and finally won by them gave intellectual freedom to students in the colleges and universities, whether they sat in the professors' chairs or on the student benches. And today professors are free to put any doctrine before their pupils, provided it is well and decently clothed, and often even this precaution is not rigidly insisted upon. The fight for freedom four to five decades ago has freed the college of the old-time intellectual trammels, and for this the student today has cause to be grateful to those who battled for him. For this the general student has as much reason for celebrating the birth of Charles Darwin as has the scientific student. Darwin was more than a scientific man, he was a propounder of a new philosophy, and in this capacity he became the apostle of intellectual </seg>

That is why the boy catches flies and pulls off one leg, two legs, three legs, and so on: he wants to see what the fly will do under the new con - ditions. So he pulls off a wing, or clips both wings, to see what the fly can do with only one wing, or with two half wings. He is generally misunderstood, and is called a cruel, heartless boy, when in fact, he is not thinking of hurting the poor fly, but is only intent on seeing how it will act. This is not a' defense of cruelty, it is merely a defense of the boy who has no thought of being cruel, but who is intent upon making his little experiments. And so too we all like to make experiments upon anything, even upon plants, especially if they will respond to our attentions. Who does not like to tease a Sensitive Plant (Mimosa) to see how it will respond when touched this way or that way. Watch the next person that you show a Sensitive Plant: see how he tries the effect of a touch here, and a touch there; of a very gentle touch, and a rude one; of a jar, a breath, a puff or a blast of air. It is all very interesting. And so are very many more similar experiments and observations on plants when we know how to go about them, as how a plant bends toward the light; how an inverted leaf will as persistently turn over as will a turtle or an insect, only of course it doesn't do it as quickly. Then too there are the movements of roots, and tendrils "just as though they are alive" as an excited student once said to me. And there are the odd things about the growth of plants, how they grow more rapidly in one part of the day, and less rapidly in the other, and how to measure the rates of growth. Nor must I forget the growth of roots down, and of stems up, and the ways of show- Ing that this Is not in response to light. All these and many more things are taken up in Professor Ganong's very interesting "Laboratory Course in Plant Physiology" (second edition) which has just been brought out by Holt (New York). With half tones of photographs, with cuts, and diagrams the author shows most attractively how the apparatus is made, and how applied to the plant to make it "act up" under such conditions as will make it easy for us to see it act As one turns over the pages he longs to have the time to try this or that experiment, and I venture the prediction that in any school, and for any reader it will always produce this effect. We should all be boys again, watching actions of our plants </seg>
            <seg id="p223">223 if we followed our Inclinations after reading the suggestions in Profes - sor Ganong's book. And it is worth our while to find out how living plants act, for It is only through a knowledge of this kind, that we may know the plant in health, and this again enables us to know the nature of disease in the plant. This then opens the door to a vast field of inquiry of the greatest importance to the scientific botanist and also to the practical growers of plants of all kinds. </seg>
            <seg id="p224">224 DO PLANTS HAVE EMOTIONS' (From New York Times.) BY CHARLES E. BESSEY On first thought one who knows plants quite well is inclined to an - swer that "of course plants do not have emotions," and for practical purposes this may well be the answer to the question you have pro - pounded. So too one may answer that practically it Is not true that plants "think," for no one would ascribe to creatures of such simplicity of organization faculties as complex as are necessary in the act of "think - ing." It must be borne in mind that plant structure is of a low type, much loweT. much simpler than that in the greater part of the animal Kingdom. There are no aggregations of protoplasmic matter which In any way may be compared with the ganelia. small or large, which are the physical concomitants of that degree of mentality which constitutes thought. In order to predicate thought in plants we should have to ascribe mental functions to certain plant tissues which are very different from those which are known to have such functions in animals, and this, in the absence of positive proof, we are not warranted in doing. In other words plants do not possess those structures which are associated with thought or mentality in animals and human beings, and their want L these structures creates a presumption agalnst_ their possession of nght or mentality. Yet while all the foregoing is true, it is not by any means possible to settle the matter wholly without further consideration. The time was when plants were regarded as wholly insensate, but nowadays we know better. We know that plant protoplasm is sensible to various external and Internal stimuli in the same way that animal protoplasm Is sensible to corresponding stimuli. Contact, shock, heat, light, moisture affect living protoplasm in such ways that we are warranted In saying that It is sensitive to them. The swimming of a zoospore toward the light is a striking exnmple. but the turning of a leaf to the light is a still better one although not by any means as spectacular. Even the effect of a change of temperature, increasing or decreasing the activity of a plant, when carefully analyzed resolves Itself into a sensitiveness to heat changes. In other words into a perception of such changes, as In the case of the zoospores above they must have perceived the light, as also the leaf must perceive the light towards which it turns. When we attempt to follow out these facts we soon find that we are led far in the direction of animal sensation, and of animal response, wbere we often predicate consciousness and thought. I say we are led In that direction, but in my opinion the plant organization does not possess </seg>

That the plant has the beginnings of sensations and functions which when developed highly enough result in mentality (including thoughts and emotions) may not be doubted, but that any plant has attained to sura development has not yet been shown, nor indeed is it likely to be since plant tissues are all of too simple a constitution to suggest its possi - bility • </seg>

Nebraska Experiment Station The different lines of horticulture with which the farmer is concerned are the cultivation and care of the grove, the lawn, the orchard and the garden. Almost every progressive farmer desires to have these things about his home. The early settlers who came to Nebraska to build homes planted trees. The timber claim law also encouraged considerable plant - ing in portions of the state where otherwise trees would not have been planted. The timber claim while in many respects failed to accomplish what its promoters hoped for it. did, however, demonstrate the usefulness - and adaptability of species to localities. The best and most permanent results in the plantings around the homes have been done by men who have tried to work out a certain ideal, who have planted trees because they wanted them to decorate and protect the building site. Some varie - ties have served -thfir purpose well, while others have long ago demon - strated the mistakes of the planters. It is interesting to consider the ideals and motives which induced the pioneer to have these horticultural creations about the home. Perhaps some were anxious to provide shade and windbreaks .for the protection and comfort of the family. Others loved the fruit of the tree and the vine. The same ideal has been carried out in a general way in the plan of the lawn. It is the show window of the farmer's place of business. The thing he prides himself In keeping neat, clean and attractive. There were people in those days, and it Is unfortunate for the beauty of our state that some of them still populate the earth, who prefer to live in a house isolated on the bare prairie with not a tree in sight. One fact which in a measure excuses the man of this ideal is that he usually lives in a country where conditions are not so favorable to the growth of horticultural crops. Occasionally we find a progressive, industrious man of the farm who believes it is necessary first to reap a fortune from the fertile soil before he can build his home and surround it with the unfortunate in being burdened with teaches him his mistake. It is not to make money, it is far more imt spend it wisely. It requires practici groves and orchards. This man is ;ueh an ideal, and experience usually nough that a man should know how jrtant that he should know how to and experience to get the most out of the land from a standpoint of production, and this is equally true In the fixing up of a country home, and the elements of time must be con - sidered in the plan of any landscape. The farmer who starts his planting when he starts his building, and cares for his trees as he cares for his crops, will be enjoying the benefits of the horticulture about his home </seg>
            <seg id="p227">227 while the man who waits may never have these things. It is exceedingly interesting to study the different plans of improving and adorning the country homes in some sections of our state. Some planters have en - deavored to work out a different scheme which would be most useful and beautiful, while others seem to have no ideal of how the plantation will appear when it is finished It is an art to plant the trees, vines and shrubs in such a manner as to secure the most aid from nature in working out a useful and artistic scheme of decoration. Moat people who came to Nebraska in the early days were reared in the eastern states where the forest claimed most of the tillable land and it was necessary to subdue the forest before planting the grain. It is not strange that some of these men. who in their boyhood days were obliged to grub out a forest in order to have the soil for the pursuit of agriculture, should center their interest in the cultivation of crops and forget for a time the trees that should be companions to the lonely sod house. The thoughtful pioneer, however, foresaw the problems of building a desirable home, and planted as best he could, the trees that we of the younger generation enjoy today 1 ei-ause they make Nebraska beautiful. What an inspiration awaited the immisrant from the woodland of the east. Here on the broad, fertile prai liraska. the ideal place to build a home. How fortunate to find a country where there were no trees to disfigure the landscape or hinder the progress of agriculture. The farmer in this state could choose the best location on his farm to build his home. There were no trees to hinder his work. He could choose just the varieties he wanted anrl plant them just where he wanted them to prow. A little thought about the arrangement, a little care of the trees until they became established, v.-as all that was necessary. Nature would do the rest. though perhaps a dozen failures would accompany every success. In the early '70's a sufficient number of emigrants had planted them - selves in the eastern portion of Nebraska to make possible the organiza - tion of what exists today as our State Horticultural Society. Prior to that time those who pioneered with things horticultural, were experimen - tors, not by choice, but by circumstances. There was little information backed up by ypars of experience, at that time, to guide the Planter in his choice of varieties or methods of care and culture. In fact, all the early work in horticulture was of an experimental nature. The natives of Nebraska did not plant trees, fruits, flowers or gardens and consequently left nothing of value ♦ ■&gt; the pioneer planter. Perhaps trees were not a necessity in the rarlv day, but we know last they were appreciated from the patient care and struggle against adversity through which the pioneer planter carried his little grovp. The danger from prairie fires, the scorirge of grasshoppers, the injuries from drouth, all waged war on the young tender trees that now stand as monuments to the man who had the courage to perfect his ideal. The farmer of today has many ad - vantages which were unthought of and undiscovered by the pioneers of forty years ago. In that day there were no shelves filled with books and </seg>
            <seg id="p228">228 bulletins containing helpful information about planting trees. There were no experiment stations with their variety tests and cultural methods, and no agricultural press with its column devoted to useful horticultural in - formation, but today the farmer has the advantage of all these things and he can profit by the experience of the planters before his time and choose varieties which he knows will succeed in his locality. Along with success there are bound to be some failures. What the farmer needs today is the information of how to succeed with the horticultural things which should surround his home. The failures are discouraging and come largely from a lack of proper information regarding the choice of varieties, the culture Eire after planting. Our agricultural colleges are doing much to teach things and give the student inspiration to fix up the farm home so make it a fit place for man to live. Pie number of people who understand the nature of plant life and how iist nature in devoping the useful plants is far too few. The day is when it is not sufficient for the best development of rural life which means the best development of citizenship to have a few trained botanists who understand plant pathology and a few nurserymen who by long experience have become efficient in the art of growing trees, but this infor - mation must be distributed among the farmers and home makers throughout the rural communities. When the farmer knows how to succeed in planting a windbreak which will afford most effective protection and at the same time fill the proper place in the landscape around the home, when he knows what kinds to plant and how to care for them, when he knows what varieties will succeed best in his orchard, when he knows the beet methods of preparing the ground and cultivating the trees, when he knows the best trees to plant for ornamental and shade pur - poses and the best ways to harvest and store the products of the garden, when the farmer has all this information, the inspiration to do well what he knows how to do. will direct his attention to a proper consideration of things horticultural about the farm home. He will plant, cultivate and care for a grove of the trees that will do best in his locality. If he lives in the eastern portion of the state, he may choose the elms, the linden, the sycamore and many of the oaks. To have a few species which hold their foliage through the cold winter weather he may plant the pines, — White, Scotch. Austrian, a few of the spruces and white fir. If he lives in the central portion of the state he can still use the elms and a near relative, the hackberry, the ash, and box-elder which do well anywhere in that por - tion of the state. If he lives in the western portion of the state the number of varieties which will succeed will be limited. He will find the honey locust, the cottonwood, the hackberry and the box-elder beet among the deciduous trees, and the Ponderosa pine, the Jack pine and Blue spruce best among the evergreens. One can not use the argument that these things will not grow, because there are groves and plantings of these varieties of trees scattered all over the state of Nebraska, and the bureau of forestry is covering the sand hills with pines. </seg>
            <seg id="p229">229 There are also many shrubs and herbaceous ornamentals which will thrive and do well in all parts of our state. In the eastern and espe- cially in the southeastern section the farmer's lawn may be adorned with so many attractive shrubs that the writt-r will attempt t« enumerate but a few. A bed of hardy hydrangeas planted in groups of five or eight is one of the most attractive auiumn bloomers that could be chosen. It is slow to start in the spring and allows one to plant some of the earlier blooming blubs hke the crocus, me tulip or the daltodil. These will die down just in time to make room tor the attractive foliage of the shrubs. A bed of this kind is easy to prtpare so that it will be permanent and always makes an attractive spot on the green lawn. These things should be planted in the right way to be permanent. Spade the soil at least 12 to 14 inches deep and after the shrubs and blubs are planted cover with well-rot ted manure three to four inches deep leaving the surface slightly hollow to catch all the rainfall. There are the altheas, single and double, in at least four different colors, a half dozen kinds of choice lilacs ami an equal number of spireas. The mock orange, flowering almond, Japanese quince, snowball, which are perfectly hardy, and when arranged in groups in corners of the lawn, or used as borders or screens, present a most attractive appearance. The perennial phloxes, poppies, and the peonies in various colors, and varieties of roses too numerous to mention, afford the farmer an inviting assortment to choose from. We have not considered the ornamental climbers which can be used for arbors or porch decorations. There are not so many of these which will make the farm home attractive and be satisfactory to care for. But the teysuckle, wisteria, the clematis (peniculata, Jack and Henryii), with woodbine and the climbing roses, have about covered the desirable The people in the central portion of the state can grow a great many of the shrubs that are recommended for eastern Nebraska. Some of them require winter protection but most are perfectly hardy and do as well with proper care, as farther east in the state. In addition to the assortment outlined a very tasty arrangement of shruLs which are good in the summer and attractive in the winter can be made by use of the privet. the golden willow, the red twig dog wood anl the trailing juniper. Plant perennial shrubs and herbs; these do not afford the gorgeous colors that can be produced by the use of foliage from the greenhouse but they are a wonderful saving of time and trouble when once established, and these plants do not require half the care that is necessary in the successful production of the more tender annuals. It is sometimes quite a problem to suggest sliruiis which are attractive and will stand the conditions in the extreme western portion of the state. The writer has, however, given some thought to this phase of horticulture where conditions are not so favorable. There are but few of the lawn decorations which do well and remain attractive from year to year. One farmer in the western portion </seg>
            <seg id="p230">230 thought to his neighbors. He has used Spirea van houtti which seems to be hardy even in KimlaH county, the sand cherry, the wild plum, the wild gooseberry, the native currant and the two yuccas. These are grouped and arranged in an attractive manner and have all been grown under cultivation without the assistance of artificial watering. They break the monotony of the sparsely grassed lawn and add a wonderful attractiveness to his little home. Horticultural plants need a little culivation. Usually one-half as much as is required to produce a good corn crop will be suffi - cient to make them grow and thrive well. It is an easy matter and in - volves but little expense to have these things about the home. There are many other attractive uses to which shrubs can be put. Some farmers prefer a hedge surrounding the house. The mulberry is perfectly hardy In the eastern and south central portion of the state and makes a very attrac - tive hedge as it can be trained with a spread of six or eight feet if desired. The barberries, common and purple, are very pretty for this work. But the most satisfactory shrub to use for a hedge is probably the Cali - fornia privet, as its fine leaf and close branching twigs afford almost a. perfect screen. It comes in leaf earlier in the spring and lasts later in the fall than any one of the other shrubs mentioned. Its bloom is usually inconspicuous but sometimes the clusters of small yellowish white flowers present a very pleasing appearance. Some prefer the use of a shrub that is a profuse bloomer for hedges but this idea is not easy to perfect and usually overdoes the conventional idea of decoration. Perhaps the most difficult problem in all the business of growing horti - cultural crops is the successful combating of the insect enemies and diseases which attack the shrubs. They are things which work in the might so far as the average observer is concerned, but a little observance and study will throw some useful light on this phase of caring for the plants. The roses are perhaps most troubled when compared with other shrubs. The leaf eating caterpillars will destroy foliage and the mildews will come and damage the plants. These can be kept off by the use of insecticides and fungicides, but they must be watched and attended to at the proper time. Lead arsenate is one of the most effective and safest poisons to use in the spraying of ornamental plants about the farm. It death to all leaf eating insects and does not burn the foliage or ider the growth and development of the plant. The rose should be carefully inspected from a week to ten days before it blooms as it is quite out of the question to spray a rose while it is blooming. The tender petals would be injured and spoil the entire effect of the plant as an orna - ment. Most of the roses require an abundance of moisture and if kept rapidly growing will resist the attack of some minor diseases much better than if they are weakened by neglect. Bordeaux mixture is the safest fungicide to use against mildews and rusts. If applied early before the buds commence to open it will not interfere with the bloom and discolor the foliage materially. There are hundreds of little suggestions which could be offered but the object of this article Is to point out some of the </seg>

Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Tree surgery is rather a new thing; and has only been practiced for the last half century. It is so closely related to the subject of pruning that it is hard to separate the two subjects. In fact, pruning might be classed as one form of tree surgery. However, we might consider pruning more as external treatment, and tree ■uig«l&gt; as internal treatment, sinc^ it has so much to do with the support and life of the tree. PRUNTNC The question sometimes arises as to the object of pruning Is It a fad. or Is it really necessary? In answering this question. I might say that with some people pruning is a necessity, while with others it is merely a fad. To the person who trims his trees because they need it and whenever they need it. pruning is a necessity: but to the person who trims his trees because his neighbor does, with no definite object in mind. it is simply a fad. Trees start more shoots than can become permanent branches: hence the Importance of annual pruning and training. If the shoots were allowed to grow naturally they would become so thick that the stronger v ould crowd out the weaker, very often forming undesirable branches either for fruit or shade. In the case of fmit trees a dense head is par - ticularly undesirable 1 ecause it shuts out the sunlight, thus making a breeding place for inserts and fungous diseases. SFRtrrr Treks. — In prv.ning fruit trees it Is very essential to know whtcn the fruiting wood and which is not. otherwise the primer might cut out I the wood which bears the fruit and do his trees and also himself a great injustice. For instance, such fruits as apple and pear are borne on short spurs on the old wood, while the fruiting wood of the peach is the new wood (wood of the previous season's growth). A man might be the finest mechanic but it would be a poor business proposition to turn him loose in your orchard with a saw if he did not know the difference bewteen fruiting wood and water sprouts. Next of importance is to have a definite object in mind -for every cut made. In the nursery the young tree is shaped. The framework of the tree is formed when the tree is young, and not when it is eight or ten years of age and begins to bear fruit. CJood shoots will sometimes have the removed to form this framework or skeleton: but the first pruning luld be made with this end in view.

Winter Pruning. — Annual winter pruning gives the tree a tendency to produce wood rather than fruit. In an unpruned tree there is an equilibrium, roughly speaking, between the top and the roots, just about enough roots to furnish the amount of sap for the top and each growing part. If a third of the top is cut away, this balance is disturbed and when growth starts in the spring, the roots will deliver the same amount of sap to only two-thirds as many buds, making the sap pressure on each bud approximately one-third greater. But the amount of sap pressure on any bud determines exactly the rate of growth, and so each bud in a winter pruned tree ■will, under increased pressure, make a longer shoot than othewise. A tree in the first half of summer has used up much of its reserve food in putting out leaves and growing new shoots; if these leaves are allowed to remain through the season they will repay this and store the tissues with food, for they are the stomach and lungs of the plant. The removal of part of the top is to a certain extent stimulating to the rest. The food will be deposited in and just behind the fruit buds, causing them to swell, and it is this swollen condition that distinguishes them from leaf buds. Winter pruning is best done in February and March. Summer pruning when practiced should be done in July and early August. Headino-in of Friit Trees. — By cutting off part of the annual growth each year, the branches are shortened and the trees are made lower. If the crown of the tree forms at 20 or 30 inches from the ground, it would be called a low headed tree, while one that begins to branch at 5 or 6 feet would be called a high headed tree. The advantages of heading trees low are: (1) Strong winds can not have such a leverage on the top of the tree to bend it or shake off the fruit. (2) Fruit is more easily picked or thinned. (3) Trees are more easily pruned and sprayed (4) The trunk of the tree is better shaded, which is one way of pre - venting sun scald. ilket Trees. — The street tree is subject to even more abuse in prun - ing than the fruit tree. It may not suffer so much from lack of pruning as the fruit tree, but more so from improper pruning. The abuse is often from the owner of the tree who sees his neighbor pruning his trees. The owner catches the fever and takes his saw or ax and cuts out some branches or even cuts off the top of the tree. The result is a large num - ber of water sprouts and very little shade for the next year of two. The owner is not the worst transgressor of the street tree, however. The lineman with his hand ax, and the banana man letting his horse roam untied along the side of the street, are some of its enemies. The in- </seg>
            <seg id="p235">235 juries caused by these people are due to pure carelessness. Large limbs are cut from the tope of the trees to allow a wire to pass through, or the wire may be wrapped around the trunk of the tree, which is nothing more nor less than a slow means of choking the tree to death. Pruning of street trees, like pruning of fruit trees, should have some motive such as: (1) To remove dead or injured branches. (2) To secure a more vigorous growth. (3) To reduce competition among branches. (4) To adapt the tree to the purpose of shading the street or walk. I Removal of Branches. — This should be done every year, removing the A branch below the point of injury. It may be necessary to remove er branches also to keep the shape uniform. To Secure More Vioorous Growth. — The theory of this operation is to remove certain parts of the tree so that the food material will be dis - tributed into the other parts, so stimulating that part This is often done with old trees or trees that have been abused, but requires experi - ence in pruning. To Reihce Cum petition Among Branches.— When limbs are too crowded to gain their full development, some of them should be cut out so that the best branches will receive plenty of light and develop greater leaf surface. To Adapt the Tree to the Purpose of Shading the Street. — If prop erly pruned when young, the tree when it becomes older will give the greatest possible shade; but sometimes injury requires the removal of a branch; a new branch may be forced in its place by proper pruning of other parts. In general, then, young street trees properly cared for by removing crowding branches, cutting back over-vigorous growth, and leaving a leader will not need much pruning when they become old. Seasur kob Pruning. — The time for pruning shade trees can not be definitely set. In general, early spring before the leaves come out or in Kfall after the leaves have fallen. If done before the leaves come out spring, new layers of cambium will then be formed partially over the inds before they dry out. Maple trees should not be pruned in the spring, but in summer. The sap flows from the cut wounds more readily and protection for the wounds is more difficult, because antiseptics will not stick to the wood so well. For this tree tar applied hot will stick to the cut surface better than paint ?How Wounds Heal. — The stem of the tree consists of — (1) bark, 2) cambium layer, (3) layer of sap wood, (4) layer of heart wood. When a branch is properly cut, the wound is covered with a cushion of woody material called callus. This callus is composed of food material pre- </seg>
            <seg id="p236">236 Ein the leaves above or beyond the cut. Stubs cannot heal. The wood does not heal and remains moist, so it is essential to cover wounds with some material such as paint, wax. or tar. to keep iter and disease germs. rm to Mark the Cit. — This is one of the most important things all in pruning, and ignorance of which kills so many good trees anything else there is a right way and a wrong way. The wrong way is to sliver up the wound and peal off the bark for several inches around the wound, leaving a stub to become diseased and die back into the trunk of the tree. The right way is to remove the branch by making a clean cut close to the trunk of the tree and parallel to it. This can only be done with sharp tools. In cutting off a branch, especially a lar branch, the first cut should be made from the underside of the branch and a short distance from the trunk or larger branch. K to 1 inch deep. Then removing the saw the main cut should be made from above and a few inches farther from the trunk than the undercut. The branch when severed from the trunk will then break off squarely and not split down ■ The stub left can then be removed close to the When ir is to prune a young shoot, the cut should be made just nbove a l.ud; if cut in the internode the wood will die back to the ll bud, and leave a chance for disease to enter the young twig T'«&gt;i* r&lt;i 1"sk i\ Pki mm.. — The kind of tool to be used depends upon the kind of pruning to be done. The thumb and finger may be used the first year in the nursery to nib off small undesirable buds, and the ax may be used to remove tree after it has died of old age, but between thes&lt; two stages the saw. knife, loping shears, and pruning shears are the most practical. In pruning both fruit trees and shade trees, there should be an object or motive for every cut made to conform with the type of tree species; a leader or growing point should be left to eliminate crotihes as much as possible; all branches to be removed should be cut off close to the trunk ■:hes, and no stubs left: all large wounds should be painted &gt;u hire a professional tree primer, — Don't allow him to make an umbrella of your tree; Iion't allow him to leave stubs; Don't pay him till after he has painted the wounds. TREK SURGERY Tree surgery includes the protection of cavities and all mechanical injuries. This work of treating cavities is still in the experimental stage. The operation depends upon two factors: (1) That all decayed parts of the cavity be removed and the exposed surface washed with an antiseptic; The cavity when filled must be as nearly air-tight as possible. </seg>
            <seg id="p237">237 Any antiseptic such as creosote, corrosive sublimate, paint, tar, or copper sulfate may be used in washing the cavity. Labgk Cavtttt.s are sometimes filled by bricking up the opening on the outside and filling the inside with concrete, the brick serving the pur - pooe of holding the concrete in place. The concrete used is made in th5 proportion — 1 part Portland cement 2 parts sand 4 parts crushed store. Els properly mixed it can be poured into the cavity from above tamping will be necessary. The outside of the filling is coated (hin layer "of concrete. 1 part cement and 2 parts sand. Another method of filling is to drive nails on both edges of the cavity, and by lacing a wire across the cavity to hold the concrete. The fillings of the concrete should come flush with the inn»r bark of the tree. The swaying of the tre&lt;&gt; sometimes cracks the cement, leav - ing a apace I etween the filling and the wood. This can be partially remedied by coating the inside of the cavity with thick tar before filling with concrete. Tree surgery also includes such work as bridging girdled trunks or branches, fastening together of split crotches, and treatment for gas Injury. BRnwiN'o GiRni.En Trees. — Sometimes the bark Is peeled off around the trunk or branch of the tree in the form of a ring. This ring or girdle cuts off the downward flow of food material from leaves to roots, and consequently the tiee starves to death. It can often be saved, how - ever, by bridge-crafting the wounded part. This is done by trimming smooth the edges of the girdled part and inserting cions of the same species under the bark in such a way that the wonnd Is bridged over. These cions are placed close together around the stem, unite at the ends with the old trunk, and serve to conduct the elaborated food ma - terial from the part above to the part below the wound. Thus the tree can function nroperly until the wound in healed. E'o Horn * Spt.tttt^o Crotctt. — A hole Is bored through each limb, above the crotch and a rod with threads on both ends is placed in holes, the threads extending through the outer side of each limh A and washer Is placed on each thread and the connecting rod holds limbs firmly In place. TsEATMiciTT for Gas Ix.ttrt. — In the larger cities where underground gis pipes are a necessity, many fine trees are injured by gas escaping from the pipes into the soil surrounding the roots of the trees. The first indications of gas poisoning are the drying and yellowing of the leaves during early summer and an early, falling of the leaves. The bark loosens and falls away from the trunk and sometimes the peculiar odor </seg>
            <seg id="p238">238 of gas can be detected on the bark and soil surrounding the tree. The best method of treatment is to aerate the soil around the roots by break - ing up the soil surface. Sometimes a ditch can be dug around the tree a few feet from the trunk and let the sas escape by this means. We see, then, that by a few simple methods many of the del our trees may .he overcome. Men who have made a lifelong study of plant diseases toll us that many which annually destroy thou - sands of fret of lumber and many beautiful fruit and shade trees enter the wood through cavities and other injuries of the tree. Knowing, partially, how to overcome these defects by proper pruning and proper treatment of mechanical injuries, is it not our duty as citizens of this great state to use our knowledge and our influence for the betterment of our trees . </seg>
            <seg id="p239">239 ORNAMI NTIN&lt;; THE FARM HOME BY VEB.NON V. WES TO ATI, Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station. E planning our farm home, a place which is going to be ideal not from the standpoint of beauty but also in point of convenience and y, we find our ideas conflicting. The two plans will not coincide. In other words, the most convenient home is not necessarily the moat beautiful one, and likewise, the most beautiful home cannot have all tha possible elements of convenience and utility. I think a single example will be sufficient to show what I mean by the above statement Any one can easily see that it would be possible to make a farm house appear more beautiful if placed, we will say. a quarter of a mile from the barn, feed lots, etc., other conditions being the same. We do find a similar arrangement of buildings on many of our large estates, but for the aver - age farm such an arrangement as this would be altogether too Incon - venient, and therefore expensive. But even though we do find these two kinds of places differing some - what, yet we will notice that they have many points in common. It is possible, then, to arrange our farm buildings so they will be convenient and yet have a beautiful place, — although such an arrangement may not be ideal in respect to both of these qualities. The construction of the farm buildings and their relation to one another is In reality outside of the subject of this paper. For that reason I will only say as regards their location that tb.3 barns, feed lots, etc., should be a reasonable dis - tance from the house and on a side so that the prevailing winds will not carry the odors from the barnyard toward the house, and will then pass on to a discussion of the uses of trees, shrubs, etc., in ornamenting, beautifying, and protecting the place. Windbreaks are important features, or at least should be, on every farm. I think each one of us is willing to admit their importance pro - viding such a one has had the pleasure of facing one of our bracing winter winds with nothing to break its effect when the thermometer registers below zero. If we do not happen to have the orchard or a grove already protecting the house from the north and northwest winds, we should provide such a protection. A double row of evergreen trees like the Scotch or Austrian Pine or the Norway Spruce set fifteen feet apart will give very gcod protection in a few years. Fast growing evergreens are better than deciduous trees for such a purpose, since they hold their leaves during the winter months. Similar windbreaks ought also to be planted north of our barns, sheds, and feed lots. Such plantings will not only directly protect our stock from the chilling blasts of winter. </seg>
            <seg id="p240">240 but slock so protected will require much less food than those animals which are forced to "rough" it in the open. Since the average farm house must be located rather near to the barns and feed lots, it Is advisable to use some artificial means of pre - venting these more or less disagreeable views heing seen from the house. To accomplish this, trees and shrubs should be massed in groups between the two but at some little distance from the house so that they will not Bthe open lawn which we wish to preserve. For although hiding reeable views is something the farmer should endeavor to accomplish, I is fully as important that he preserve all good views from the i toward the country about it Too much planting is apt to be another one of the faults made by the farmer when he carries out his landscape improvements. But com - parativMy few trees and shrubs are needed, provided they are arranged in their proper places. Flower beds consisting of annual flowering or bedding plants should be pretty largely avoided on the farm. Such plants, although giving very beautiful effects when well tended, require too mui-h care during the farmer's busiest season and therefore are not of practical use. If weeds are allowed to grow up in such beds, the effect is very much worse than if no flower beds are used at all. The necessary shade about a farm house may be provided by using comparatively few trees providing they are properly located. Do not attempt to hedge in the place by putting trees all about it. Instead, plant r. few trees on the sunny side of the house if possible in order to shade it in summer so that it will be cooler. Also plant a few trees to the rear of the house so as to give a good background effect to the place, but leave a good open space in front for the lawn without any trees or shrubs on it. Nothing gives more naturalness or beauty to a place than a broad, well-kept lawn bounded by irregular borders of trees, shrubs, and other flowering p'.ants. For the farmer to have a good lawn, it means that he must carefully mow and trim it once every week or so. Although the grass may properly be allowed to grow longer in the country places than in the city, yet it should not be allowed to seed and remain in such condition during the entire summer as is often the case. In choosing trees, shrubs, and seeds for planting, always decide, if possible, on those which are adapted to your soil and climatic conditions — those which are perfectly hardy in every respect. The average farmer cannot afford to run an experiment station for testing very many plants I uncertain qualities. This does not mean, however, that he must limit use of trees, shrubs, etc., to three or four kinds. There is a variety of these various plants suited to almost every locality — another fact which a great many farmers should learn or at least should practice when making plantings if they are already aware of such a thing. On some places I have seen no less than fifteen or twenty box elder trees planted where a specimen or so of that plant used with several other kinds would have given a much finer effect. </seg>
            <seg id="p241">241 Koncluaion, let nit- say that every place demands more or leas indt - treatment. A house faring the north must have a different r»la - the other buildings than if it fared the south. Likewise a place on an east slope must be arranged differently from one on a west slope. But notwithstanding these things, we shall yet find that the general rule* of arrangement and planting which I have given briefly should be carried mentation on the place is concerned. </seg>
            <seg id="p242">242 DISEASES OF THE APPLE. BY C. E. TEUl'LE, LINCOLN, NEB. INTRODUCTION. Calses m Disease. — The \arious causes and conditions that produce disease in the apple tree or its fruit may be treated under the following heads: Unfavorable soil conditions. Unfavorable atmospheric conditions. Mechanical injuries. Parasitic conditions. I The cause* that fall naturally under these different heads are more less related, for any one of them may produce conditions favorable one or more others. Thus, a certain disease may be caused directly by conditions that fall under one of the above heads and indirectly by conditions that fall under another head. For example, a mechanical injury may cause a tree to function abnormally yet not kill it, but a fungus may enter the tree through the wound and kill it. Here the fungus was the direct cause of the death, whereas the wound was the indirect cause; yet both contributed to the killing of the tree. UNFAVORABLE SOIL. CONDITIONS. WtT Sou.. — I have observed that if the soil is continually wet, the apple tree will not grow well. This is not due so much to the extra amount of water in the soil as to the lack of air. The interstices of the ■oil are flXed with water instead of with air. In wet soil, also, certain fungi thrive and are able to attack the roots of the tree, causing root rot Dby Soil. — I have noticed also that, if the soil is continually very dry for a long time, the tree will become sickly and eventually die. Such a tree is a harbor for many fungi, and if it be allowed to stand, it may become a center of infection, so that the trees for rods around it may become Infected with the same fungi. PfACE Drainage. — I have often noticed that the trees along a surface would be affected alike. Spores, and twigs and fruits containing are often gathered up during heavy rains and deposited along the drains and over the lower land of the orchard. This no doubt is one reason why the trees in such places are generally diseased more than the trees on the higher land of the same orchard. Rat Soil Conditions. — Barren, too coarse and too hard soil have each, ing effect on the tree. Certain soils are without the necessary ic salts, others contain too much gravel, and still others hare </seg>
            <seg id="p243">243 a substratum of very hard clay. In the first two cases the roots are unable to get the required amount of food material; In the third case, however, the roots are unable to penetrate the soil far enough to get the Cuired food. In all such cases the tree doos not function normally, ■e It may be said to be In a "pathological condition." UNFAVORABLE ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS ETix&gt; Lmv HrMimTY. — Too low humidity ran -ive evaporation m the leaves. If this condition prevails for some time, the atomata will close to prevent the excessive loss of water. If they are continually closed for several days, the tree will suffer from the lack of carbon dioxide gas. which cannot enter it in sufficient quantity except through the stomata. This condition stunts the tree. Eto High Htmrnrrr.— If the humidity Is too high, that Is, If the air :urated and the leaves are wet for a long time, the stomata do not Ion well. Worse than this, however, are the fungi and the bacteria that are liable to attack the tree and Its fruit under such conditions. During such times, ilso, cloudy weather prevails, which not only em - courages the fungous parasites In their attacks upon the apple but also discourages, almost discontinues, the manufacture of plant food, which checks the development of the fruit. Excessive Heat a^d Coij&gt;. — Both are destructive to the production of apples. Excessive hear from the sun causes what is known as "Snn Scald," a very serious trouble In some sections of the country. The fruit as well as the tree may be thus affected. This again aids the fungous parasite the rot-causing fungi can easily enter the "scalded" fruit and the wood-decaying fungi find an open door to the tissues of the tree through the "scalded" bark of bole and branch. Excessive cold, when the fruit Is "setting," may cause all or much of It to fall; or before gathering time, if the fruit is frosted, the crop may be almost entirely lost by the soft-rot fungi which are sure to fol - low. Thus apple trees should not be planted for commercial purposes In too hot or too cool countries. Vkntii-ation. — I have seen orchards with high, dense hedges almost surrounding them so that the wind could scarcely creep through. Such a condition may protect the orchard from the storms but ft is far from protecting the fruit from the fungi. In fact it favors the fungi a great deal. A similar condition prevails where double planting is practiced without thinning at the proper time, or where the trees were set too close together through ignorance. Large trees left unpruned present the same results to a lesser degree. MECHANICAL INJURIES. tPBtMNG— Pruning is a necessity and in itself should not produce a hological condition in the tree. However, pruning as it is generally ,e In this country is very injurious. Every living branch removed </seg>
            <seg id="p244">244 leaves a wound. It is as truly a wound as that produced by the removal of a part of the living animal body, but it Is not so considered by the great mass of orchard growers. Hence little or no precaution is taken In the case of the plant to protect those tissues exposed by the wound against disease germs, drying out, etc Thus wood-attacking fungi gain easy entrance to the heart -wood of the tree where they produce decay, and In time they may penetrate every branch, killing them as they go. Such wounds should be protected by putting some antiseptic on them, such as lead-paint or coal tar, either of which will keep the spores of fungi from entering and the tissues from drying out. Other Injttbtes. — Orchard trees receive injuries from various sources. The breaking of branches by wind storms, or by being overloaded with fruit, or even by carelessness on the part of the picker when gathering the fruit, altogether produce a great many exposed tissues. Then the barking and the bruising: of branches by hailstones and also by machinery during cultivation, add still other wounds. Finally, the feeding of insects and otheT animals on the foliage and the fruit, the cracking of the fruit due to cverripeness or to surface diseases, as the scab, result In many more ways of entrance for fungi and bacteria. DISEASES OF THE APPLE DFE TO PARASITIC CONDITIONS. There are animal and Insect parasites on the apple, as well as fun - gous parasites, but only the latter fall within the scope of the botanist. So only fungous parasites will be treated here. convenience they may be divided into two classes: (1) those that &gt;ct the tree mainly, and (2) those that affect the fruit mainly. Many the parasites that live on the apple affect both tree and fruit, but In every case they do muoh more Injury to one than to the other. So those that do the most Injury to the tree will be discussed under the first head and those that do the most injury to the fruit will be discussed tinder the second head. FUNGOUS DISEASES OF THE APPLE TREE. Apple Rt-st. HisTOST. — The fungup producing the apple rust, like those producing so many other rusts, is heteroecious, that is. It requires more than one host plant on which to eompMp its life-cycle. Besides on the apple. It Is parasitic on the cedars. Jitniperws communis and Tuniperus virginiana, where it produces a kind of growth very unlike anything It produces on the apple. Hence, to the early botanists these two stages of the same fungus were apparently two distinct fungi and they were described as such and even placed in different genera. Those forms parasitic on the cedars were placed in the genus Oymnospnranqium and those parasitic on the apple, and its relatives, were put in the genus RoesteHa. In 1805 De Condolle* described the genus Oymnosporangivm . A little </seg>
            <seg id="p245">ater Link split the genus and put all of those species with more or Itm ini lasses in the genus Po&lt;lisnma. and re- alr! pd linpd all of thosp with irregular gelatinous masses in the genus Gumiiomxirantiiu. 3ion was retainPd a long time, it haj nnccpssary: so that Oymnospnrangium Is now f of the fungus became known, the cr i f:ir as apple rusts are concerned. IT' if thp rust is often used to designats XB&gt; ha 4 Prarti knowledge of the heteroecions habits f the apple rrst is due to the research work of Dr. Farlow, and at that time his student. Mr. Thaxter. In 1880 Dr. Farlow published the results Imp h of hi lpra. Oiimnonporanpium aid Hoestelia and the relat n them. His work was that of a master's hand he descr bes the in each genus. They are enumerat ,v r. 7 r r f a tu R. botryapites R. transforma R. cancellata. R. cornuta. R. lai R. peniciUata R. hvalina. R. aurantii To the first genus Dr. Thaxter in 1891, added another species, Q. nidvtaris. Of the nin^ species thui described, I have been able to find only two in Nebraska. O. marroput and O. globosum. However, other my investigations were limited to small areas. Thp host plants ir pvery case were the same species The Tkt.ki tosi-orr Stage of tb sr. — The teleutospores are the win er spores and they develop in small cup-like depressions beneath th« ■pidermts of the so-called "cedar apples" which grow on the leaves anc twigs of the cedar trees. The cedar apples are not apples at all bul simply galls produced by the hypertrophy of the Infected parts of th« tO. biseptatu; O. clavipei. O. eonicunt? elia— species mMJ he present in t! </seg>
            <seg id="p246">246 tree. This stimulating of the host to excessive over-growth of these parts is very peculiar: the parasite is able not only to draw all of its food material from the host but also to direct the growth of the host into specialized parts for its own use in the production of spores. Tfiese cedar palls may be produced very abundantly. In December, tW gathered six quarts of them from two sma'l trees. Between these trees and the apple orchard fifty yards away s'ood buildings and various other trees. This shows that the spores may be carried by the wind or other - wise some distance even though theTP be obstructions. Also a few days ago I found three trees in East Lincoln, similarly situated as those above with respect to the apple trees, loaded with the galls. I coun'ed 78 on a branch less than one inch in diameter at the base. The pall itself may vary in size from 2 mm. to 5 cm. in diameter. It is a ;nore or less spherical, convoluted., chocolate-colored mass of ho»* tissue permeated with the fungous mycelium. During the rainy days of spring, however, it presents quite a different appearance. The spores, which rre produced during the winter and early spring beneath the epidermis in the small cup-lil&lt;e depressions which cover the convoluted surface of the gall, burst forth in light, orange-colored, jelly-like masses. These vary in shape: nine are more or less globular or irregular, others are conical or distinctly horn-shaped. They vary also In size from a few millimeters to three centimeters in lennth and from two millimeters to a centimeter in thickness. Both size and shape vary as the species and as the humidity of the air. If the weather remains damp for several days when these spore-masses come out. they stick together and completely cover the gall. If, however, the wet weather lasts but a short time, the masses of jelly shrink to one-fourth or one-fifth of their former size. This swelling and shrinking may be repeated many times if the weather conditions are favorable, until finally the individual masses become amorphous, spreading over the surface of the gall and sticking to it. IMic»)S&lt; opic Desckii'Tion. — The host cells of the gall are abnormally 5e and more or less spherical. Before the fruiting stage of the fungus the cells of the parenchymatous tissue are filled with starch; but after the fruiting stage very little of the starch is left, the most of It having been used by the fungus. The fungous mycelium consists of long, slender, branching filaments which permeate the intercellular spaces and collect at the bottom of the small cup-like depressions which contain the immature teleutospores. The teleutospores develop on the ends of fila - ments which at first are very short. As the spores increase in size the filaments bearing them increase in length. Finally the spore-mass be - comes so large that it bursts through the epidermis, and, when it comes in contact with moisture, swells up to many times its former size. Dur - ing this swelling process, the filaments increase to the full length of the Jelly-mars while the spores at this time increase comparatively little. The jelly-mass is made up of three parts. — filaments, spores, and a hyaline medium. Of the three the filaments probably make up the </seg>
            <seg id="p247">247 greater bulk since each one bears only a single spore. I studied these by mounting them alternately in water and alcohol. The latter would remove all of the water and leave only a dense hard mass of shrunken filaments and cells. The filaments always seem to have a great affinity for water. So when water was again put on them they at once began to increase in length and at the same time they twisted and turned from side to side. The spores are of a beautiful rich orange color forming the surface and outermost portions of the jelly-mass. They also give the color to the mass. The spores are two-celled. Each cell has a separate thick wall and is more or less conical in shape. The two cells are joined at their bases, forming the two-celled spore. Each spore is attached ■ lower end to the filament. The hyaline medium is a transparent, sticky, semi-fluid substance composed principally of water. The purpose of it seems to be to bold the spore-mass together and to keep it from drying cut as soon as it would otherwise. This retention of moisture is necessary, for the spores will not germinate unless they are kept moist for a few days. When the spores germinate, each cell sends out generally two pro - mycelia but may send out only one or as many as four. Each pro - mycelium produces one to several minute, thin-walled, spherical, orange - colored spores, called sporidia. Then the promycelia deliquesce, m«Mm £ jelly more sticky. Eventually the whole mass dries up and is ready wind and insect distribution. The Cluster-cup Stage of the Rust. In the dissemination of the sporidia, those spores that fall on the apple leaves or fruit or young twigs, or on those of certain related trees, germinate immediately, under favorable conditions, and enter the host. At the point of inoculation, the leaf soon turns pale green and generally bulges just a little. Then minute brown specks appear on the upper surface. These signify the presence of spermagonia. The clustftr - cups, however, several days later burst through the epidermis on the under surface of the leaf. Each cup contains a large number of brown, more or less spherical, single-celled spores. These spores blow back to t cedars, lodge between the scale-like leaves and twigs, germinate and uce a new crop of galls which in turn the following spring will pro - a new crop of winter spores. I The rust sometimes does a great deal of injury to the apple trees I somo damage to the fruit. The worst affected leaves often fall pre - turely, and, too, the affected fruit is not salable. The usual recommendation for the control of the rust Is to remove all cedar trees that are near the orchard. Personally I do not believe this is sufficient to control the disease on those varieties which are especially susceptible to it. In the spring of 1909 I observed the rust on the leaves of a Prairie Crab hybrid before the spores had a chance to be scattered from the cedar trees. The Prairie Crab hybrid wa» Tery </seg>
            <seg id="p248">248 badly affected the previous summer; the ends of most of its brai had been killei by the fungus. This observation leads me to believe tn the fungus may live through the winter sometimes on the branches of th&gt;. ee tree. However, there is no experimental evidence on this point to at ibis time. Blight. Biifillun amylovoruM (Burr. I I)e Toni Apple blight, known also as pear blight, twig blight, and fire blight, Is caused by a bacterium. The tender twigs and the ends of the branches become affected and die. I have seen trees so affected that more than half of the twigs were killed. The leaves, as a rule, do not fall soon, but cling to the dead twigs, sometimes even after the normal leaves have fallen. thave made several cultures of the bacterium, using twigs that were 1 by blight and also the living part of the twigs near the dead por- In each case I was able to get the characteristic bacillus.

            <seg id="p250">250 like mass is the vegetative part of the parasite. It is made up of minute, slender, branching, septate hyphae which are entirely without chloro - phyll. The hyphae do not enter the host directly but they send out hailstorm which penetrate the epidermal cells and draw from them whatever nourishment is available. After the vegetative growth has gone on for a time, the fungous spores are produced. These are In the first place single. uni-eelluhir, spherical spores (Conidia) which are formed on the ends of comparatively large filaments branching from the myce - lium in a vortical direction. These filaments are called conidophores. The conidia thus formed serve to spread the fungus rapidly during the summer. This is the asexual method of reproduction. The sexual reproduction of the Mildew occurs later in the season. The spore-hearing bodies (perithecia) develop only where the hyphae or come in contact with each other. The perithecia are dark, opaque 1 odies, somewhat roundish in outline, bearing several branched appendages on each perithecium at or near its upper end. The perithecium contain* a single mm in which are eight rather large, elliptical spores. These spores germinate the following spring, when conditions are favor - able, and produce the mildew as described above. It appears first usually rather late in June and increases during July and August. Possibly the most injury to the host is done to the tips of the tender shoots, although the leaves are often lost early, leaving the buds not fully developed and without sufficient stored up food ma - terial to start normal growth the following spring. Great Injury is often done to nursery stock. Howover, the fimgus may he checked or even destroyed by spraying with Boidearx mixture and ammoniaeal solution. According to Mr. D. G. Fairchild* the first spraying should be the last of May. This should be followed by two applications in June and two more in July, all about equally divided as to time.

Aderh Venttiria pomi (Fr. ) Wint. t'usi&lt; lailutm dendrituum Wallr. lailiufti denlriticum (Wallr.) Eckl. Apple scab is one of the worst diseases that attack the apple. It attacks the leaves and branches as well as the fruit and it is found practically wherever apples are grown, the world over. It does most injury, however, in cool, temperate regions. The fungus appears first on the leaves in the form of "olive-brown spots." These spots are more or less circular in outline and range in size from a mere speck to a centimetre in diameter. Sometimes the spots are so thick that they run together and cover almost the entire leaf. In such case itv- leaves fall. This dwarfs the apples on the tree if there be any, and weakens the tree for the following year's growth. These diseased spots or patches produce summer spores which spread the disease rapidly to other leaves and to the fruit. Still, the young fruit may be attacked almost simultaneously with the attack on the first leaves and especially ere the tender stems of the young fruit attacked, when the fruit is "setting," causing it to shrivel and eventually to drop off. Very great loss in the crop is effected by the parasite in this way. The truit, however, that does not fall, shows the characteristic growth of the parasite best. In this case the spots appear at first about like those on the leaves but as the fruit grows and matures the spots become dark brown or even black with a light colored border, caused by the cracking or breaking ot the epidermis. This gives the spot a scab-like appearance, from which was derived the popular name of the disease, "apple scab." I have observed also that apples are more scabby about the blossom end than around the stem end. This may be due to the more advantageous position and to the structure of the blossom end for the reception of spores and the retention of moisture. The scab itself covers a mass of spores, condia. borne on the tips of little stalks, conidiophori's It is these that cause the apple to crack, giving easy access to the following fungi which cause soft rot: Penicillium glaucum. Cephalothecium roseum. Sclerotinia fructigena. Mucor stolonifera. </seg>
            <seg id="p252">252 Scab does not rot the fruit but these fungi enter through the broken epidermis of the scab and cause very great loss to apple growers and shippers. The scab fungus passes the winter in the host plant The winter spores are two-celled. Generally eigbt of these are produced in each sac (ascus), and a number of these asci are produced in a spore case (perilhecium) which is beneath the epidermis of the host plant. The 'lisease can be successfully checked by spraying with Bordeaux mixture. It is recommended that the first spraying be made before the leaf buds begin to open, the second just when the flower buds begin to open, a third about two weeks later. Other sprayings may be made later in the summer if the spread of the fungus seems to demand it BlTTEB KOT (rl ill ii mil (Berk.) dp. von Scbr. Synonyms: aeptoria rufomacuians Berk.

How - ever, I nave seen certain varieties of apple in small orchards lose almost all of cheir fruit in a very few days by a rot-fungus which seems to have been the one that causes the bitter rot. (TMa observation was made in Missouri, but I have not seen apples affected with bitter rot that were grown in Nebraska.) The bitter rot appears in July and August and spreads rapidly, if the weather is warm, tultry and rainy. If the summer is cool and dry the fungus is unable to spread very much.

            <seg id="p253">253 spores io escape. These spores, when not washed from the fruit, form pink masses, sticky when moist As the spore mass dries, it cakes and adheres to the epidermis, on quiet, dry nights the spores are discharged in long tendril-like threads oozing out slowly from the mouths of the black bodies, which are the fruiting bodies of the bitter-rot fungus. These black bodies or pustules are often arranged in the form of a ring. As the rot progresses, other rings of pustules appear outside of the first one, and at regular intervals six or eight, and sometimes more, well - defined rings may form in rapid succession. Each ring will have hun - dreds of pustules, each producing spores at the fame time, so that some rings appear almost continuous." * As the pustules are sticky the spores are not disseminated by tho wind, bui water dissolves the spores apart and the rain scatters them to fruits near by and below. Insects also serve as spore-oearers. These spoies intect other fruits, and so on in rapid succession until the whole orchard has been devastated. The winter spores are produced in cankers on the apple trees and in the fruit itself. Before 1MI only the conidial stage of the bitter-rot fungus was known, however, the periect or ascus stage has since been discovered. Ferithecia containing Md nave been found in the affected fruits and in the cankered branches. Ihe aad have each generally eight oblong, unicellular spores. These start ihe infection on the fruit the following summer. The following preventive measures have held the fungus in check: The cankered branches were removed and burned; the old diseased fruit was destroyed; and spraying with Bordeaux mixture at least once before the buds open, and again frequently from midsummer until the fruit is almost ripe, (von Schrenk and Spaulding.) Black. Ki/i. $phaerop*is malormn, Peck. Tee fungus, aphatruptis malurum Peck., causes what is known as the black rot of apples. It attacks the leaves, twigs and fruit. On the leaves it forms brownish spots and eventually may cause the leaves to fail prematurely. On the twigs and branches it forms a canker that was once taken to be a sunscald. Fruit affected with the fungus decays rapidly. It turns brown at first but finally becomes black and wrinkled. I have found only a few apples in Nebraska that seemed to be affected with this fungus. 1 have, however, seen a considerable quantity thus affected farther east v. here a great deal of damage has been doaa to the apple crop during the ripening state. The spore fruits are produced in the affected apples and leaves and also in the cankered branches. To prevent the rot the cankered branches should be removed and the tree.3 should be sprayed with Bordeaux mixture about the same as for scab. • Von Schrenk and Spaulding, Bui. U. S.

E'he sooty fungous disease of the apple is known also by the names -Speck Fungus" and "Sooty Blotch." The fungus does not enter tissues of the apple but it spreads over its surface giving it a dirty, y, fly-speck appearance. This makes the fruit very unsalable. The black specks may be scraped off with a sharp knife or rubbed off with a rough cloth, leaving tiny pinkish specks instead. The disease spreads more rapidly during wet seasons and in low, moist or shady places than during dry seasons and on dry, upland locations. Too much crowd- Ing of the trees is also an advantage to its spread. I have seen trees in Missouri so affected with the fungus that hardly an apple escaped being attacked. I have noticed also in the same orchard that certain varieties of the apple are more susceptible to the attacks of the fungus than others. For the prevention of the fungus Mr. Selby of the Ohio Experiment Station (Bulletin No. 121) makes the following suggestion: "Aside from selecting high, sunny situations for the apple orchard, spraying with Bordeaux mixture will prevent the spot. One spraying made at the time the apples are the size of hickory nuts prevents all or nearly all of the injury." </seg>

I The rapidly growing interest in the control of plant diseases has led Botanists of various Experiment Stations to prepare so-called "Spray Calendars" for use in their respective states. This publication has been prepared to meet this need in Nebraska. We believe the method of treatment is such as to render the material of the greatest value to farmers and fruit growers. Our plan has been to state very clearly and briefly the following points regarding each of the diseases mentioned: A. Symptoms and Cause of the Disease. B. Methods of Control or Prevention. C. Bibliography containing references to some of the most recent or useful 'ilerature generally accessible to farmers and fruit growers. The diseases are arranged alphabetically by their prevailing common names under the various crops, which are also arranged in the same manner. The scientific names of the various crops and of the fungi causing the various diseases are given for the reason that only in this manner can any misunderstanding be avoided. FUNGICIDES. At this point only such fungicides are described as require special directions for their preparation. Other simpler formulas are given in connection with the special diseases. AMMONIACAL COPPER CARBONATE. Dilute the ammonia with water and add the copper carbonate. Use just enough of the ammonia to dissolve the precipitate formed. Dilute with water to make 50 gallons BORDEAUX MIXTURE We give here only the following standard mixture, often referred to as 5-5-50 Bordeaux. The other formulas mentioned in the text are pre - pared in the same manner by changing the amounts of the Mme and copper sulfate. Copper sulfate (blue vitriol) 5 pounds Quicklime (not slaked) 5 pounds Copper carbonate 8 ounces Ammonia 3 pints Water 50 gallons </seg>
            <seg id="p260">260 1. Dissolve the copper aulfate in a wooden vessel, using about ten gal- lons of warm water. Dilute to twenty-five gallons before mixing. 2. Slake the lime very carefully with a small amount of water and then dilute to twenty-five gallons before mixing. 3. Pour the above two solutions thru a strainer at the same time into a LIME-SULFUR WASH This is widely used as an insecticide, but its value, in certain cases. as a fungicide warrants us in including it here. Sulfur 15 pounds Lime 20 pounds Water 40 gallons Slake the lime and then add the sulfur together with enough water to permit of easy handling. Boil the mixture till the sulfur is dissolved. Strain and add water to make the desired volume. Apply while fresh. LIME-SULFUR WASH (SELF-BOILED). Sulfur ("flowers" or flour) 10 pounds Lime ( fresh ) 15 pounds Water 50 gallons "Place the lime in a 50-gallon barrel and pour a 2 or 3 gallon bucket of boiling water over it. Immediately add the sulfur and another bucket of hot water. The heat from the slaking lime will boil the mixture violently for several minutes. Some stirring is necessary to prevent burning, and more water should be added if the mass gets too thick to stir, but the cooking is more effectual when the minimum quantity of water is used, usually from 6 to 8 gallons being required. A piece of old carpet or gunnysack thrown over the top of the barrel helps to keep in the heat. The boiling will continue from twenty to thirty minutes, depending upon the quality of the lime. When the boiling ceases, dilute with cold water to make 50 gallons, stir thoroly and strain thru a sieve of about 20 meshes to the inch in order to take out coarse particles of lime, but all the sulfur should be carefully worked thru."

Sis fungus causes a brownish-red spot on the surface of the ripening This spot becomes somewhat sunken and soft and beneath it the has a bitter taste which gives the disease one of its common names. 9 surface of this spot the dark colored summer fruiting bodies ap - pear in nearly concentric circles. From these bodies the spores escape tn a pinkish gelatinous, often spirally twisted, mass. The spores are washed apart and distributed over the tree by the rain. Cankers are developed on the twigs and in these another spore-fruit is produced. Spores from these cankers are able to infect the fruit and produce the typical bitter rot. 1.

The leaves on the young shoots turn black and then later the twigs themselves become blackened and dead. Sunken pits or "blight cankers" are often found on the young wood.

SCAB (Tenturia inaequalis) The well-known scabby spots appear on the fruit, which is not only disfigured but the broken surface of the apple near these scabs affords a good opening to other fungi to enter and produce serious rots. Scab often results in a great increase of "windfalls" and thus reduces the crop. The same fungus produces spots on the leaves and on these same leaves the "perfect" stage of the fungus develops late in the season. The twigs are at times affected. 1. Gather and burn the leaves during the fall. 2. Spray with 3-3-50 Bordeaux mixture as follows: A. When the cluster buds are open but before the flowers open. B. After the petals have fallen. C.

A thoro spraying when the apples are about half grown seems best. BAELEY (Hordeum sativum). BLACK RUST OR STEM RUST (Pumnia graminis hordei) The leaves and stem are first attacked and show reddish brown lines and streaks. This is the "red rust" or uredo stage. Later this is followed by a stage in which the stem and frequently the base of the leaves are covered by dark brown or black lines, often showing a dis - tinctly ruptured epidermis. This is the "black rust" or telia stage. The rust increases very rapidly when days with light showers or heavy dew alternate with days that are sunshiny and rather hot. The grain is frequently almost destroyed. This rust occurs also on some of the native grasses, such as wild barley and squirrel tail grass. 1. Destroy the native grasses around the field. 2. Other things being equal, the earlier the variety the less damage will be done by the rust. </seg>

RED RUST OR ORANGE LEAF RUST (Puccinia rubigo-vera simplex) This rust is found principally on the leaves. These become red or orange in color with a powdery appearance due to development of the spores, which are usually arranged in patches rather than lines. Later small dark spots and small short lines appear on the leaves. The red spores belong to the uredo stage and the black to the telia stage. This rust develops a little earlier than the black stem rust but under prac - tically the same conditions. 1. Apply the same remedies as suggested for the black rust. COVERED SMUT (Ustilago hordei).

This disease also occurs on many of the wild grasses such as the wild rye grasses, wild wheat grasses, Colorado blue stem, where it becomes a source of danger in feeding. It also occurs on some of the cultivated grasses such as brome grasses, redtop, and some others. ■ 1. The grass should be mown before the heads are developed so that ergot will be formed. »2. Patches that are badly affected should be burned over to destroy ergot as the grass is unfit for feed. K3. Grasses around the rye fields, known to be diseased, should be kept wed down. 4.

Among the spring wheats the durum or macaroni wheats seem to be least affected. It first appears as reddish lines on the leaves and stems. These increase in number and size, often running together to form large streaks which later become dark brown or nearly black. In both stages the lines arc frequently bordered by the ruptured epidermis. In the fall the volunteer wheat and some of the early sown wheat may show the red rust. It is probable that In this region the nist must winter over in the winter wheat and some of the wild grasses. From this the rust starts again in the spring.

I At harvest the affected heads contain no seed but in their places false berries filled with black smut masses having a disagreeable r. In threshing, the false berries are broken open and the smut spows scattered; some of them adhere to the grains of wheat. The smut spores are sown with the grain and the wheat seedling becomes infected before it appears above the soil. This smut does much damage not only in reducing the yield but wheat badly smutted loses grade in the market as it is unfit for milling purposes. This smut may be pre - vented by any one of the methods given for barley smuts and oat smuts. For small amounts the Modified Formalin Method is easiest to r)ly. For large amounts the chimney method cited under oat smut most advantageous as it is very rapid. Hkaij.. F. D r8 Bunt or Stinking Smut of Wheat. Press Bui. Nebr. Exp Sta. 28. Reprinted as Bui. Nebr.
