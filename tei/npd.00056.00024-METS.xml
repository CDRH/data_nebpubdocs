            <seg id="p003">STUDIES OF IMMUNITY AGAINST HEMOR RHAGIC SEPTICEMIA 1.. VAN ES AND H. M. MARTIN Department ok Animal Pathoi.ouy and Hygiene Within recent years a considerable interest has been de - veloped in the part played by Bacillus bipolaris septicus in the production of disease among farm live stock. Hemorrhagic sep - ticeniia was and is yet represented to l&gt;e a prolific source of loss aiming the domesticated mammals. So far as our own observa - tions |&gt;ertaining to Nebraska live stock arc concerned, there does not seem to In- cause to attach great importance to this disease a- a menace to cattle, sheep, and swine. In our investigations we very rarely encountered this infection, in spite of considera - ble effort to do so and in spite of an abundance of suspected material from cattle, sheep, and swine. In only one direction can we recognize the organism as a serious source of loss, and that is in connection with fowl cholera, a disease which exacts a heavy annual toll from our poultry raisers. It i&gt; this last named disease above all which gives warrant for a study of the immunology of hemorrhagic septicemia in general. A- one of the phases of our inquiry an effort was made to acquire some general knowledge regarding the immunizing value (1) of sera prepared with the aid of Bacillus bipolar is septicus procured from cattle and swine or {•!) of those alleged to be of service in the control or treatment of hemorrhagic septicemia in the species mentioned. The experiments reported in this publi - cation were almost exclusively made with sera purchased from dealers in biologic products. The sera examined were prepared by means of strains of Bacillus bipolaris septicus obtained from cattle and swine or which were represented, at least, to be useful in the management of hemorrhagic septicemia in the s|H&gt;cies named. In the test of the sera ( 1 ) represented to l&gt;e useful in the control of the disease in cattle or ( % 2) which were prepared by means of a cattle strain of the Bacillus bipolaris septicus. use was made of cultures of our cattle strain No. ftiO, while in </seg>

J7 the series (1) pertaining to the sera intended to be used in swine or (-2) made with the aid of strains derived from swine, our swine strain No. 59 was employed. The virus used always con - sisted of bouillon cultures at the end of a twenty-four hour incubation. Rabbits were used as test animals. The serum was injected subcutaneously. while the virus was injected intravenously. The intravenous virus injections were preferred after previous ex - periments had shown that in this manner the annoying forma - tion of abscesses and necrotic areas could Ik 1 avoided, while the difference between the results obtained with intravenous virus injections and subcutaneous ones was only expressed by a slightly shorter incubation period in the case of the former. For so far as this was possible each serum was utilized in two test series. In one of them there was variation in the doses t serum given. All the animals in this series received the ini on a given day. while the virus was injected twenty-four rs later. In the other series all the rabbits received ten c.e. of serum on a given day. The series was then divided into four or five groups, each of which received the required amount of virus at periods from three to five day- apart. I - — _ __ _j In the first series the influence of the amounts of serum w taken into consideration, while in the latter we aimed to obta information regarding the duration of the passive immunity, case anv should l&gt;e manifest at all. Second injections of virus were given to all surviving ani mals. usually some two weeks after the first virus injection was administered, with a view of ascertaining whether or not the subsequent injection of virus into a serum protected animal would engender a more enduring and active immunity. BOVINE STRAIN SERA The tir&gt;t series comprises the te~t~ made with varying do&gt;e&gt; of serum. In one of the tests (No. 10.VJI a parallel nunilx-r of rabbits were injected with normal horse serum in order to pro]) eriy appraise whatever nonspecific protective influence, may Im&gt; attached to a foreign serum per se. The details of the tests are exhibited in Tables 1-11. </seg>

There appears, however. In lie a marked difference in the potency of some of the sera ex - amined. The tal&gt;le&gt; show that protective influence of the sera examined manifested itself in two ways. — in the first place by actually preventing the death of experimental animals when injected with virulent cultures, and in the second place by in - creasing the approximate surviving period, after virus inocu - lation, of tlit- serum-treated animals which actually succumbed. as compared with the ones treated with normal serum and with those which served as virus controls. Of the &lt;&gt;!&gt; rabbits treated with serum and virus. -J&lt;&gt; survived. Approximately two weeks after the latter had received the first virus injection, they were inoculated again with the same virus. fable Nn. 14 shows that none of those survivors had become resistant to infection as a result of the strum-virus treatment they had previounly received. A certain lengthening of the siir- iving periods after the last virus injection could be observed. S I able !."&gt;. i </seg>

The influence of the serum in the series is only shown by the lengthening of the surviving periods of the treated rabbits. This phenomenon is shown in Table 25. In comparison with the virus-control rabbits, there is a marked tendency on the part of the serum-treated animals to survive longer after the virus inoculations.

It is manifest that in some of the sera examined a striking protective quality is present, but it is also manifest that even in the most potent specimens the passive immunity conferred is of hut short duration and that as a rule it has vanished within a week. The influence of the serum is further shown by the lengths of the surviving periods of the animals. It will be observed that as the intervals between serum and virus inocula - tions lengthen there is a corresponding shortening of the sur - viving periods. The behavior of the surviving periods is fur - ther shown by the graph exhibited in Table 47. Table 44. 1922 No. 1946 i .abbit No. Injection No. 1946. March 18, 10 c.r.

            <seg id="p038">SUMMARY OF RESULTS 1. Of the sera against hemorrhagic septicemia of cattle and swine examined, some show marked protective qualities which are expressed (a) by preventing death in a considerable number of the experimental animals when the latter were inocu - lated witli virulent cultures and (b) by a lengthening in the surviving periods of those which succumbed to the infection. In other sera examined, the potency was not sufficient to prevent the death of a considerable numl&gt;er of the animals injected and the protective qualities of the serum were only shown by a more or less manifest lengthening of the surviving periods. ■J. However marked the protective qualities of a given Merum may lie, the passive immunity conferred by it is of a rapidly evanescent character and completely vanishes within the -pace of tine week. 8. Animals treated with serum and virulent culture do not become actively immune; in other words, the virus injected into a passively protected animal in no way renders the immunity more lasting. Animals so treated uniformly succumbed to a subsequent injection of virus. 4. The fact that certain against infection by 1 &gt;a«-i 1 1 n - hope that it may lie possible them to In* of practical value. iera are in a measure protective bipolar is septicus warrants the «&gt; to improve them as to cause Further study and investigation with that object in view are l&gt;otli needed and justifiable. </seg>
