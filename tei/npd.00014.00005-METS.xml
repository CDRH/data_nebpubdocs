A. - AN ADDRESS BEFORE THE 8TATE HORTICULTURAL MEETING, Fremont, Nebr., July 2Mth, VM)S. The Nebraska For. ves are sand hill reserves, they were set aside by Presidential proclamation on April 16, l'JU2 for the purpose of determining whether or not trees can be grown suc - cessfully in the sand hills. We believe this to be possible and entirely practicable, and it is our purpose to improve the general conditions of the country by establishing forests on these reserves. The presence of trees on the hills that are now as bleak as any - thing that can well be imagined, will beautify the country and in time supply the local demands for forest produce The results of our work will be of great value to the people of the entire state. If we find by experiment that certain trees are well adapted to our conditions and that they grow and flourish in the sandy soil we can then recommend such trees for general planting. And our experience whether successful or unsuccess - ful in tree planting will always be for the public. </seg>
            <seg id="p012">12 The Dismal River Forest Reserve, because of its nearness to the railroad and basis of supplies was selected for the seat of our work. This reserve contains M,000 acres and lies between the Dismal and Middle Loup Rivers in Thomas and Blaine Counties. During the summer of 1902 this reserve was surveyed and a nursery site chosen. The most suitable location for a forest nursery was found along the Middle Loup River two miles west of Halsey, where we established our headquarters and began per - manent improvements. The Bureau had decided to grow from seed the trees that are to be used in planting this reserve. The very first work begun was the preparation of a one half acre seed bed. The site chosen for the nursery grounds is bottom land lying close to the river and about eight feet above the level of the water. The ground, before being cleared, was grown up to a thicket of plum and choke cherry brush. Strange as it may seem the very first tools ude use of in preparing for the coming forest was the mat - tock, one of the worst enemies a tree has. The ground was grub - ed, plowed, harrowed, and raked; the latter operation being re - peated until the soil was free from roots and in perfect condition to receive the seed. The seedbed block was then set with eight foot posts, placed eight by eight feet each way; these support a roof of woven picket fencing which affords the little seedlings partial shade and shelter from the wind and hail. The entire inclosure when completed resembled a huge chicken coop. The separate seedbeds within the inclosure are seven feet wide by one hundred and thirty-six feet long. Each bed lias a capacity of seedlings, and there are twenty-one such beds in the half acre block. I After the preparation of the seedbeds came the collecting of lead. A party of four men were sent into Pine Ridge and b Black Hills to col • of the Ponderosa or Yellow Pine, d two men were sent into the Jack Pine t f Michigan i to collect seed of the Divaricata or Jack Pine, d a large quantity of Red Cedar seed was gathered along the atte River in Western Nebraska. It was late in tin </seg>
            <seg id="p013">13 THE WORK OF THE BUREAU OF FORESTRY IN NEBRASKA before the seed was received at the Reserve Headquarters and we succeeded in planting but five of the seedbeds before winter set in. Witli the opening of spring seed planting was resumed, the remainder of the original half acre block was planted and another half acre was prepared in a similar manner to the first and this was also planted in Fine seed. As to the kind of seed that is doing the best with us, I bei that I can safely say that the seedlings from the fall pla ponderosa seed are much ahead of any of the others. The trees are larger and have withstood the attacks of fungus d uore successful than any of the spring planting. Some of the seed that we planted failed to germinate, other ininated only a small per cent and came up so slowly that they were quite provoking. The Divaricata or Jack Pine which is a wry small seed germinated very readily, but because of the extreme tei of the little trees this species suffered a heavy loss by damp, ing off. However, there are yet enough surviving plants to make a fair stand. It is' altogether probable that fall planted seed of the Jack Pine will produce seedlings that will withstand damping off fully as well as the Ponderosa have done. Damping off fungus disease which is common during warm moist weather, it attacks the tree during the very early t" their growth. This season marks the beginning of the work on the Niobrara ve which contains 136,000 acres lying between the Niobrara and Snake River in Cherry County. We have at present a party of six men surveving the boundaries and making a thor&lt; study of the woody species found growing there, and of the ditions under which they are growing. In my trip across tha serve last week with Professor Emmerson and Mr. Mast, we highly pleased to find the conditions there so favorabl. work. The reproduction of the Red Cedar, and the Pine along the rivers, creeks, and canvons is splendid, and we found s&lt; comparative] v voting trees growing out in the hills. The rank growth of grass now covering the hills will prevent further i. al reproduction. There still remains a few scattering tre« </seg>

We are in -tate to help the people in every way that we can and partic - ularly in the work of tree planting. To those who are prepar - ing to establish a plantation the Bureau of Forestry offers free lance. When desired, an Agent of the Bureau will be sent \aniine the ground of the proposed planting and give advice ding the species of trees that he believes should be planted. n found advisable a carefully prepared planting plan will be made, this covers in detail every step of the work in making a plantation, from the preparation of the ground for planting to the time the trees are able to take care of themselves. The success of a plantation depends upon the preparation of the ground for planting, the proper selection of suitable species, careful planting, good cultivation, and protection from the abuse of stock, until the trees are large enough to shade the ground, and above the reach of cattle and hoi&gt; 1'he most successful sand hill plantation I can refer you to is plantation of Jack Pine on the Bruner Brother's ranch near in P. O. Holt County. This plantation was set out in the ng of 1891, the trees were then three year old forest grown Ilings about eight inches in heighth. By the actual measure - it of thirty successive trees in one row I found the average jjhth of the trees to be 16.85 feet, and the average diameter of same trees was 3.12 inches one foot above the ground. The iks of these trees are as straight as arrows and the general ditions within the plantation are such as are typical of a forest. ! shade is so dense that it is only in the more open places that find an under growth of grass or weeds.

I was fortunate enough to find a few two year old seedlings and a good lot of seedlings of this seasons growth. A few Scotch and Western Yellow Pine were also set out in this plantation, they were somewhat slow in making a good start but they are now making up lost time. By taking the mea&gt; ment of fifteen Scotch Pine trees I found the average height growth for this season to be 22 inches. The greatest of any one tree was 49 inches. The Western Yellow Pine showed an average heighth growth of 17 inches for this season.

Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: I do not rise before you to criticise yon in the least, but I cannot understand why yon will put a man of my calling on a program of this kind. I did not even know what my subject was to be until the printed pro - gram was placed before me. The subject in itself is sufti' for several most excellent addresses and splendid papers. Our pilgrim fathers, when they started from the mother coun - try across to this country, had an idea and that idea was banked on unity. As they came across they had also to meet a unity and it was a unity of the buffets of the old ocean. And as they atrnck these, they came still across until they landed, and then for the very first time they realized what unity meant. And ever since the landing of our pilgrim fathers, unity and discord have been clashing all along the lines of progress. I think that in this country we go at our work with too much muscular energy, we do not use our brains enough. We fail to have that unity that we should have to produce the best results. Preparation is one of the essential things of life. Proper prepar - ation of the soil always brings good results; it means granaries </seg>
            <seg id="p016">16 full of rich grain, it means also beautiful forests, beautiful fruit of every kind. You have met here to discuss some of the most useful things we have in life. Rob me of Nature's beautiful gifts, and you rob me of four-fifths of my life. Nature never does things by halves, everything is perfect. You never saw Nature create a warty apple that was done by halves. The warts were always complete. The halves were made just as they should have been made. You never saw Nature paint a beautiful pic - ture upon a large beautiful symmetrical apple, where the roseate hue was direct from the God of Nature, that was not perfect. God's paintings have never yet been discounted on canvas. They are always along the lines of perfect unity and perfect har - mony. You take that lady as she sits there at the piano. To produce the finest music that has even been penned by man, you will notice that she always strikes certain chords that produce perfect unity and harmony. As you listen, you hear coining from that, that beautiful tune "Home Sweet Home." She strikes another chord, and what do you hear!; '-Nearer My God to Thee." a ]&gt;erfect union and harmony such as God only has created. She continues along the lines of harmony, and Liszt's Rhapsodies ■ to you as they never came before. If you were to place different notes or chords in the music, you would notice that •■Home Sweet Home." "Nearer My God to Thee," "Liszt's Rhapsodies," each one or all of them would be imperfect. As I stated previously, preparation is one of the essential things of life. The soil, to produce the best fruitage, should be properly prepared, but all that preparation would be void if back of it were not our united efforts. By that I mean that we should be thoroughly imbued with the knowledge of that which g&lt;&gt;. make up this beautiful plant, and the chemical changes of God's laboratory, which produce perfect vegetation. God said "Let there be light," and there was light, and then he made the vege - tation. It is necessary to have God work from his great labora - tory. So I say it is necessary for the people to know something about the soil. All of us would rest easier if we knew that Sep - tember would come without a hot wind. We are glad to have </seg>

When I came to this state, fifteen years ago, such a thing as this meeting was seldom heard of. They had meetings where they discussed cattle, hogs and sheep with more interest than they did their children or the things that made for good or bad. Their theory, once a good boy always a good boy. A good theory is always a good thing. I haven't words at my tongue's end to exj you my ap - preciation of the decorations about our public school grot. There is that little forest tree for instance. It adds more to a child's after life then the teacher can. Give me a beautiful lawn and forest trees, well kept, and I ask for nothing better. Thank God no one can take a mortgage on my vision of the beautiful. I am a better man and you are better men and women for t surroundings. I am pleased with the efforts being made to beauti - fy our public school grounds, and the boys and girls as they step down and out to other fields of usefulness, will fondly recall their school days spent amid such pleasant surroundings. Their influ - ences will last through life. Harmony and unity will be theirs through eternity. There is another thing that I wish to call your attention to and that is this — we need unity in meeting one another. We harmony in meeting one another. This thing of going through life without a purpose, I have no use for. Let us aim for unity in all things, for harmony and square dealing. The strength of the sun and dew is only tested when there is perfect unity. Take a pumpkin vine for example. It has been shown by tests, that the force expended by a pumpkin vine during its first month of growth, is equal to lifting a weight of 250 pounds. In an month it lifts 1,000 pounds, and in three months it lif' pounds. Think of the wonderful forces of nature, and what a beautiful thought. I tell you it is impossible to keep this Society from doing the greatest and noblest work of any society in the </seg>
            <seg id="p018">18 We want to be more practical. It is by our united efforts that good will come to us. Today we are here, tomorrow we are not, but between and beautifying the whole is the home. Cross na - ture with unity and harmony with love. It is a thing worth try - ing for. We want to seek these lines, and when we have doae all this, then close with this beautiful poem: There are loyal hearts, there are spirits brave. There are souls that are good and true, Then give to the world the best you have And the best will come back to you. Give love, and love to your heart's fill flow. For strength in your lime of need, have faith And a score of friends will show their faith in your word and deed. For life is a mirror of king and slave, 'Tis just as you are and do, Then give to the world the best you have And the best will come back to you. SMALL FRUIT. BY .1. W. 8TEVENS, NORTH BEND. The subject "Small Fruits" is not a small subject. It migh include Cherries, Juneberries, Currants, Gooseberries and othe bush fruits; also Raspberries, Blackberries, Dewberries, Buffalo berries, Grapes, Mulberries and Strawberries. We cannot giv any special attention to all of these in one brief paper. The se vere freezes of April 29th and 30th ruined the crop of many o the small fruits, strawberries and blackberries about the only ex ceptions, and we cannot speak of the fruiting qualities this yea of many sorts of fruits. Currants and gooseberries were a total failure. Juneberries and grapes nearly a failure and raspberries did not yeild one fourth of a crop though they wintered through in an unusually good condition. Strawberries were injured but little by the freeze, but were injured by two much rain flooding them and causing many of them to rust badly. I will speak of strawberries more particularly further on in my paper. Dwarf Juneberries are probably the most reliable of small fruits. Cold or heat, drouth or wet weather, nor rabbits or in- </seg>
            <seg id="p019">19 SMALL FRUIT sects prevent them from bearing fruit. Though in full bloom at time of the April freeze they bore considerable fruit, or enough to interest the birds. They are truly a lazy man's fruit, and good enough quality for lazy people. They are propagated from sprouts and these sltould be dug very carefully or a large percent - age will fail to grow. When once established, they are a perma - nent thing. It is best to cut out the old bushes in fi\ yean. Currants and Gooseberries are not a specialty with us. Iu the last few years the leaves of these bushes drop prematurely so that fruit buds are not formed for the M n. To prr this mildew or fungicide from destroying the leaves, the bi. should be sprayed several times with bordeaux and lime, i either the liquid or dust spray. We have not found gooseberries a profitable fruit commercially. The old Houghton yields the most fruit, but it is small. The larger sorts such as the Downing and Pearl have yielded light crops of large berries. The English sorts have so far been a fail - ure. Currants have been more profitable than gooseberries, though a total failure this year. We have no special recommen - dation of sorts. The Fay currant is the largest, but the bn - not a good grower and not long lived. Some new sorts are being introduced and we hope they will equal their recominendat The gooseberries and currants should be planted on rich soi made rich by manure. They will succeed best on moist soil or where partly shaded. The old wood over two years old should be pruned out and useless branches on the under side. Rasp - berries will do well in a young orchard, the partial shading being a benefit to the canes. The canes hold the snow in winter which is a benefit to both canes and trees. They must be thoroughly cultivated and weeds destroyed or trees and canes will b&lt; lv injured. Only those sorts that are propagated by the tips should be allowed in an orchard. The sucker sort are too hard to control in an orchard and absorb too much moisture. The tip ends of the young canes should be pinched or cut otf when one and a half to two and a half feet high which causes them to </seg>
            <seg id="p020">20 branch. The large late sorts should have the rows at least seven feet apart and would advise planting two feet apart in the row. Only about fifty per cent, of the plants usually grow, as the tips are more tender than strawberry plants. They are about the most unsatisfactory plant we sell. The soil should be rich for raspberry plants and well cultivated or mulched, if you cannot cultivate. We find black raspberries seldom winter kill if thev have had plenty of moisture in the fall and winter. We grow Palmer and Tyler for early fruit. They are not as productive or profit - able as medium or late sorts. We consider Courath and Kansas the best medium sorts. Of the two we prefer the Courath. The Older is a good medium sort, large, hardy, and of excellent qual - ii/, but too soft to ship well. Of the late sorts of black caps, we prefer Cumberland, Neniaha and Mills. The Munger is prob - ably a valuable sort but have not tested it long enough. The berries of these sorts are very large and are the most profitable for commercial planting. The Wallace and Redfield and Cardi - nal Red are red sorts that grow from tips. They have no briers and bear a liberal quantity of very good fruit. They are vigor - ous growers, but are easily controlled and may be planted in a garden. Of the sucker sorts of red raspberries the London is the largest and bears fruit the longest. It does not sucker so free - ly as other red sorts and therefore more easily controlled. The Turner, Cuthbert and Miller are excellent sorts and will bear satisfactorily if kept in narrow rows and surplus suckers cut off as if they were weeds. The red sorts have borne a better crop of fruit this year than the black. The red sorts will not winter kill easily if they have the necessary amount of moisture. Dewbemm MM a valuable fruit which all might enjoy who bare laud to plant them on. The vines may be covered with mulching during the winter, and in the spring place the mulching under the vines to remain there till the fruit is picked. Plant them three feet by six feet. The tips are very tender and many of them fail to grow. When ordering plants, get some surplus and in a year you can use them to fill in vacancies. The Lucretia is still the leading sort. Blackberries are easily grown. The Snyder is the </seg>
            <seg id="p021">21 8MALL FRUIT most reliable. We plant them three feet by seven feet and let them form a hedge row, cutting back the new growth when two to three feet high. Sprouts between rows may be dug out in the spring or fall or cut off all suckers but those in the row. Moist conditions for these as well as for the raspberries are necessa preserve canes and insure a crop. I will not attempt to treat on grapes in this paper. A man may plant a grape vine successfully and cultivate it, but it vain effort to make him understand how to prune it. Strawberries are the easiest grown and most productive of all the small fruits. Twenty -seven thousand quarts have been raised on one acre, a quantity exceeding the yield of potatoes or on There has been a prolific crop of them this year in Nebraska wherever there were plants. We suffered some loss by flooding, but more by rust, caused by e Varieti* that have never rusted before, and some did not rust that are U8uallv liable to it. We have been experimenting this year with about lift and during the past ten years we have tried and discarded nearly that many sorts. We cannot recommend all these sorts. We cannot take time to describe the planting, picking and marketing of strawberries, but will briefly as possible give our experience with them this year. We usually spray early in the season with bordeaux, paris green and lime, but had no opportunity to do it this year because of the frequent rains. We regard this as im - portant for health of plants and for their protection from in - and rust. Varieties that rusted the most were Bederwood, Brandywiue, Excelsior, Glen Mary, Haverland, Marquerette, Parker Earl, Staples, Wolverton, Seaford, Wartield, Challenge, Lyons, Miller, Palmer, Rough Rider, Sample and Giant. Varie ties slightly injured were Golden Queen, Jessie, New York, Saunders, Splendid, Dunlap, Bennett, Marie, Minute Man, Phillips Seedling, Sutherland, Nic Ohmer and Dubach. Vari - tiesnot rusted, Bismark, Clyde, Carmi Beauty, Crescent, Enh&lt; Gandy, Johnson's Early, Princess, Tennessee Prolific, Bryan, Kansas. Monitor, Parson's Beauty. The most productive </seg>
            <seg id="p022">22 Bismark. Clyde, Carmi Beauty, Gandy, Jessie, Princess, Dunlap, Tennessee Prolific, Warfield, Bryan and Kansas. The least pro - ductive were Excelsior, Johnson's Early, New York, Parker Earl, Sample, Seaford, Challenge, Lyons, Miller, Palmer, Rough Rider, and Knicks. Such is our experience this year with these sorts. It may no harmonize with that of other growers, nor does it correspond i many respects with that of preceding years. Some of our be&lt; bore the third crop and they appeared as thrifty and bore as fin berries as those that bore the first crop. Gandy, Jessie, Bubacl Princess, Tennessee Prolific and Clyde were better on the thre year beds than on the one year beds. With all our experienc in varieties we have never found one that excels the Warfiel in productiveness or quality of fruit. As size and not qualit is the standard of merit in strawberries, we have to grow more o the larger sorts. We plant in rows three and one-half feet apart and eightee inches apart in the row, and prefer to have the matted row no more than two feet wide when plants are done growing. In wet season this will require heroic work cutting runners as the exceed this limit. The narrow rows stand drouth better, the ber ries are larger and more easily picked, and such a row will yiel&lt; as much fruit as a three foot row. There should be a good fur row between the rows for drainage and for irrigation in fall o spring. We plant one-half of staminate or fertile sorts, alterna ting the early and late blooming sorts. The Warfield needs a early and late fertilizing sort. The proper fertilizing of straw berry plants is an important item in their productiveness, an( there is much loss and discouragement among the amateur grow ers in consequence of not having their plants properly matec The agent or grower who sells plants should see that his custom er's plants are properly sorted.

CARE OF THE OLD STRAWBERRY BED. BY WM. DAVIE8. In this paper I shall attempt to speak only of the care and at - tention that I think is proper to give to an old strawberry bed. I shall speak only of the care we have given at different times to our old beds at Brownville. What will do one season will not do another. What I shall say, however, will be what I should think is the proper care that should be bestowed on them one year after another. This care depends on several things. It seems to me that the proper question should be the care of a strawberry bed, cutting out the word "old" as the attention given to a bed from the time of its first planting will determine largely the care of it the second season. As a general rule I do not think it advisable to continue a bed longer than two seasons. The first thing I would say is this: If yon are raising fancv berries and wish to raise these alone, don't let your bed get old but as seon as the first crop has been harvested put in the plow and settle the question there. The most of us, in fact, I hope all of us wish to raise fine fruit. Some of us, however, are not bo situated that we can command fancy prices for our fruit, and so we seek the cheapest way possible to produce as good fruit as possible. We must remember, then, that fancy fruit cannot be produced as cheaply as the ordinary run of fruit we see on the market. In order to produce as good fruit as possible for the least money possiBle, we must not destroy our beds after secur - ing one crop, but put some labor on them, and secure another crop. The treatment to be given the bed depends on soil, cli - mate and varieties of berries grown. What will do for one vari - ety will not do for another. If the weather should be very dry along about the time the picking season is over, I don't think it would be advisable to do much, if anything, with the bed until </seg>
            <seg id="p024">24 rains would come, as it would be cheaper to lose the bed than the bed and some extra labor, too. But if the season should be favorable, take the bed as soon as the last picking is done, mow it as close to the ground as possible. If the leaves and trash will dry enough to burn in two or three dayB, leave them there and when dry sprinkle enough straw over the bed to carry a fire, take a windy day and burn.it over letting the fire run with the wind. This will keep the ground from getting hot enough to injure the crowns of the plants. When this is done put in your cultivators and stir up the soil well tearing out all plants except a very nar - row row or hills, as you may desire. We prefer the row at all From now on until the end of the growing season, culti - vate the ground every week or ten days, using some tool that will give shallow cultivation, and at the same time keep the ground level. We use a "Planet Jr.," twelve tooth cultivator, running a pulverizer behind. Probably one or two hoeings may be need - ed in the row. This, of course, depends on whether your soil is foul or not. When enough plants have set, cut off the run - ners, and don't allow the plants to set any more. Better have the strength put into developing the plant already set, than have a lot of weaklings. In the fall if your soil is rather thin I would top dress them with well-rotted stable manure. Inhere people plant their beds in young orchards, of course, y cannot burn them over. However, I believe it good policy ilways mow the foliage and weeds in the bed. In case of Qg in a young orchard I would carry them off and burn them, jn treat the bed the same as if it had been burned over. Take Gandy strawberry, for instance, I would always burn r whenever possible. They are the finest berry grown and if perly handled will produce as many cases per acre as any other ietv, and then "Oh, well, we all know that when we get a idy strawberry we have something." P&gt;me people will let their beds go after the crop is gathered out doing anything with them. Where this has been done should by all means run a disc or fine tooth harrow over the the next spring, stir up the soil and destroy the weak plants </seg>

Remember, the plants cannot mature large fine berries in hard baked soil any more than a sow can raise large healthy pigs on nothing but dry corn. Where people have home beds of a few feet square, it would be proper for them to hoe their bed into rows and stir the soil with the hoe as often as the com - mercial grower would stir it with a cultivator. We must always keep our plants thin enough so that each stock of berries can get light and air. We do not always mulch berries in the fall, because the object of the mulch is to keep down the weeds, the berries clean and retain as much moisture as possible. For this reason we wait until spring and after cult ing once or twice put in the mulch. A straw mulch. I don't think it is much of a winter protection. Our experience has been that when we had winters severe enough to injure the bed posed, they would be severe enough to injure the mu. beds, and the one would be caught as bad as the other. N let your planes run and form a matted bed, because if you do the prickers will destroy as many as they carry in and your yield will not be any larger than if one half the ground was tilled with plants and they kept in rows. FLORICULTURE. BY CHARLES H. GREEN, FREMONT The subject of Floriculture is one that covers a great deal of ground, and I will be able at this time to touch a point here and there, only in a general way. We will take into consideration only a comparative few of the numerous members of Flora's family, selecting those that are hardy, or so nearly so that they are able to stay throughout the winter on the lawn or in the nursery row with a little protection. That queen of all flowers the rose, is undoubtedly the most beautiful, valuable and import - ant of all, and although we are considering the subject from a commercial standpoint, the thoughts of the true flower lover will turn from line-outs, own-roots, two-year-olds, etc. to the de lightful legends and history of the rose. </seg>
            <seg id="p026">26 The origin of the rose is unknown. One legend has it, that a ertain Jewish maiden being condemned for witchcraft and sen tenced to be burned alive at the stake, declared her innocence nd called upon God to show it, whereupon the burning brands urned to red and the unkindled ones to white roses, the firs ver seen upon earth. The Egyptians grew roses on \he bank of the Nile in the days of Homer. There were roses in the langing gardens of Babylon. I The Jews of Palestine held them in high esteem and possessec ■eat knowledge of their culture. The Romans were the firs &gt;ople to know and make use of the methods of forcing roses t oom during the winter months. It is altogether probable tha e form of the rose two or three thousand years ago was decided different from what it is today. Due to the fact that the form flower life are constantly changing under cultivation. W low however that the rose was then, as it is now, and no doub ill always be, a thing of beauty and a joy forever. Comin )wn to the present time, the hybridizers of the past few year ive made rapid strides in the production of new and the improve ent of the older varieties. I Prominent among these acquisitions is the Crimson Rambler id its more or less worth}- pro-types. Or perhaps I should say i less worthy, and unsatisfactory imitations which include the r hite, Pink and Yellow Ramblers, and the greater part of the iclierania hybrids. These are the results of ineffectual efforts to •odnce various colored types of the Rambler family and are not &gt; be compared with the crimson sort, in any way. The latest Idition to the ramblers is the one known as the Philadelphia ambler, said to be an imnroved crimson, without the tendency to mildew which is the only fault of the original. We grow the crimson rambler on its own roots entirely and it Propagates easily and grows readily under any conditions. Among the other climbing roses, mention should be made of Madam Wagram, a climbing type of the Paul Neyron. Caroline Goodrich or running General Pacq., Climbing La France, Climb - ing Soupert, Waltham Queen, and always remembering that good </seg>

The most popular sorts are known at least by name to every one who takes any interest whatever in the culture of roses. Our method of propagating the few plants that we grow consist of rooting cuttings from new wood in a bed of sand, in August, potting up and carrying over winter either dormant or in the greenhouse and lining out in spring. A mulch in late autumn is all the protection we ever give them in the row. There are a number of vari of semi-hardy bedding roses that should be handled more exten - sively by the nursery trade. After the stock is secured, and is growing in the field, the plants can be propagated eanly, in a muslin covered bed of sand, using two or three eye cuttin_ fairly well ripened new wood. With the exception that the - must be well protected in the field or else lifted and stored late in the fall, it can be given the same treatment as the hardy m When bedded out in the spring these I t right down to business and continue to bloom with the greatest profusion until cut down by the frosts of autumn. These are the sorts known as ever-bloomers. That much abused and miss-used term that has probably been applied by somebody to even variety of rose in existed Among the best of the genuine ever-bloomers are the Helen Gould and the Gruss An Teplitz, in reds. The Madam Viger, Prince of Bulgaria, Clothilde Soupert, Madam Cochet in shade* of pink, the Helen Cambier, Isabella Sprunt, Homer. Henry M. Stanley, Coquette de Lyon in shades of yellow and buff. Than are a great many varieties besides the ones named that will give excellent results when treated in the manner described. Roses thrive best in a heavy, part-clay loam, but will give good results in any soil with a reasonable amount of care. The old, dead wood must be kept cut out, they must be trimmed back into shape - ly bushes, the surface of the bed must be kept free from weeds and well cultivated, a sprinkle of wood ashes well worked in. and an occasional top dressing of well rotted stable manure will pay </seg>
            <seg id="p028">28 big dividends in both quantity and quality of bloom. Practically all of my own rose growing at present, consists o forcing under glass for cut flowers. The varieties being th Bride, Bridesmaid, Lrberty, Perledes Jardines, Souv. de Wooton Golden Gate, and American Beauty, and during the past year w produced something over forty thousand blooms of these sorts. As our methods of growing will probably be of little value o interest to the majority of you, we will devote a few moments t hardy perennials, shrubs etc. In the herbaceous section are man beautiful plants that should be better known; I take the won herbaceous to mean, a plant producing an annual stem from perennial root. Astilbe Japonica is an example and is a tine thing. The dark green cut leaves form a handsome tuft from which arise numerous panicles of feathery white flowers. The Convallaria or Lily-of the-valley is another plant that should be seen more frequently. The Dianthus genus presents a richer variety of tints in scar - let crimson, rose and orange than is to be found in any other genius. D. Barbatus or Sweet-William is an old inhabitant of the flower garden. D. Chinensis the china pink, flowers the first year from seed and being perfectly hardy, flowers much stronger the second. The colors are exceedingly varied and rich. In a hundred plants scarcely two will be found alike. The carnations grown by florists all over the country are members of this genius, but are not hardy. Perennial Phlox is another extensive and interesting genus. It is exclusively North American and contains many of our most valu - able, hardy, herbaceous perennials. The varieties include White, Pink, Rose, Purple, Scarlet, Crimson and a near approach to Yellow. Paeonies: the improved "Piney'" of our grandmothers is an excellent thing. They are rapidly coming into favor as a cut - flower and during the past season thousands of dozens of the large, grandly colored blooms were sold at good prices in the wholesale cut-flower markets. </seg>

A rapid grower, requir - ing no care or protection it always gives satisfaction. The Anemonies should be seen more frequently, as should the Perennial Pea, Achilles, Platycondon Grandiflorium and many others. A few of the better known shrubs are found on nearly every lawn. Among them, the Viburnum Opulus or snowball. The Syringa Vulgaris or Lilac. The Hydrangea panaculata, and the Spirea Van Houtti. The Philadelphus, commonly called Syringa or Mock Orange. Their popularity is due to the ease with which they are propa - gated, to their sure blooming qualities, the beauty, abundance and fragrance of their blossoms and their ironclad constitutions. To these should be added, the Deutzia's, Gracilis and Lemoinei, two of the most desirable shrubs in cultivation. They flower early, are perfectly hardy, and propagate readily from cuttings, divisions or layers. The Spirea family consists of about fifty members. Many of them being shrubby species, with white or pink flowers, making beautiful plants for the lawn, thriving in almost any situation and continuing a long time in bloom. A great many other things might be mentioned, that are beautiful and easy of culture. Things that in time will be seen in nearly every door-yard. When one stops to think of it, it is hard to realize that only a few years have elapsed since our state was a broad, bare prairie. And as the country grows older, floriculture will increase much more rapidly, until in course of time Nebraska will, indeed, blossom like the rose. PERENNIAL FLOWERS. BY C. 8. HARRISON, YORK.

And it is time for forward movement along this line. The York experiment station, after great pains and much ex - pense, has gathered fifty kinds of lilacs alone besides a large col - lection of spireae, syringas and other shrubs, and is now reach - ing out for perennial flowers. They have about thirty-five thous - and peonies, in over three hundred varieties, thousands of phlox - es, columbines, perennial poppies, gaillardias and lilies in large variety, besides many other varieties. More and more, perennial flowers are growing in favor. An - nuals generally have small seeds, and they must be sowed shallow. Tin- ground dries before they can come up, and when they are ready to bloom the hot season is on, and often the sun and siroc - cos are too much for them. Of course their roots are smaller — do not run as deep and more readily dry out. Again the west is the busy end of the world, and we do not want to stop to plant things every spring. We want them already planted and ready for bwsim If we have gladiolas, cannas and dahlias we must be careful and take them up in the right time in the fall; they must be stored juet right and they should be planted in season. A little defect is fatal . Hardy perennials give us little trouble. They are stronger every way. They are in bloom from early spring until severe frosts and are just what the people need. I will mention some of these in the procession of beaut}' they give us. The pansy perhaps needs the most care, as the plant is not a strong one and it might be swamped with weeds. But in the early spring it is up before the weeds appear and often they will bloom in December. I have picked them out of doors in Janu - ary and they are the very first to open in spring. A bed well cared for will last for years, the seed scatters and grows of itself, and often the bed will become larger instead of smaller. The smiling and almost human face of the pansy makes it very attractive and social in its way. There is a marvelous variety of </seg>

The tulip you can have as perennials or not just as you like. I often plant them in rows two feet apart and then have lilies be - tween them. I leave them for years and let them take care of themselves These flowers should be planted on a large scale. They are cheap and if you want a goqd show, plant at least one hundred of double and single, early and late, and they will cheer you with their beauty for six weeks or more. They are gorgeous in their splendor and often like the rose in their loveliness. They too, have an almost infinite variety of form and color. Hard on the track of these come the Columbines. To get the best effect they should be planted in groups or masses. There are about fifty kinds and these in one grand blend of beauty give a charming effect. The (Joerelia comes from the Rockies, is a photograph of the white of the fleecy clouds and the sapphire of the sky. It exquisite beauty. Unfortunately, it is not longlived on the prai - ries. It does best under a screen, which gives artificial forest condi - tions. This has done much to improve the whole family, as it hybridizes very readily. This is the state flower of Colorado. Just look at a bed in full bloom! Here are the early red — the Canadensis. Then come those of longer stem; some are int blue, one is a large single, another beside it is double and the flower quilled like the dahlia; there are different shades of pink and red. In short, you have most all of the colors here and the procession is closed up by the golden crysantha, which grows in the Rockies. I saw it in its beauty in the Yellowstone Park this summer. Most Columbines bloom early and rest. But the crysantha will break out in bloom, most all summer, even in the rail. The foliage of these flowers is dense. They should be planted a foot to eighteen inches each way, when they will take care of them - selves, and the most you have to do is to look on. One trouble with perennials is people do not have enough of </seg>

It is hard to find a weed in a compact mass of Columbines. Too little atten - tion has been paid to this great family. They are cheap by the hundred and they should be planted on a large scale. You can grow them from the seed if you know how, but if you don't you had better buy them. Oriental poppies are perennials, with roots like a parsnip. Thev are very hardy. They came from Armenia and I suppose ew of you have seen them. They are often six to seven iuches across and flame color of dazzling brilliancy.

It is said there now are some silver edgings. I am experiment ing with the electing the finest, and hope by gettiug the best and saving the best, that we may have marked improvement even in this marvel of beauty. And now comes the peony, the very king of flowers. I keep about eighteen kinds of choicest roses, but they hang their heads beside some of these marvels of beautv. Of course 1 do not speak of the hot house roses. Some win ters, every rose kills to the ground, while up in Manitoba th peony needs neither manure or mulching; and away up near th Arctic circle it has been known to give sixty gorgeous flowers to the clump.

I usually cut u my roots in the fall and invariblj in the spring there will be tin roots, so small as to be overlooked, and after lying on the grount freezing and thawing all winter they start to grow and with care will soon become strong plants. An invoice from England was apparently dead on its arrival in York. The roots were black and snapped like sticks; the buds all dried up; I did not suppose they could live.

In the Herbaceous Spireas I think there is some - thing for us. I am testing three or four and they seem well ad - apted to our climate. In conclusion I want to make two suggestions. First, I think there are large numbers of our wild flowers that ought to be brought under cultivation. In the Yellowstone Park I saw one family of the Phlox that was very attractive. It was exceedingly fragrant, snowy white in color. The blos- Ktead of being on tall stems, grew in masses of the size of two hands. We often saw beautiful mats of these flowers and wit we could move them down to Nebraska. Then there are forty-eight kinds of Aston. Boom of I very tine.

Sometimes we have seen immense fields of Blue Bells reaching skyward till their intense coloring se« to melt into the blue of the heavens. Most of these flowers are perennials. The seconii ion is, that we have now reached that point in the progress of horticulture that this society should appropri ate at least one hundred dollars a year to testing hardy perennials. It might be best to concentrate on one station, and then let tin Btation. after testing, fully distribute those that gave satisfaction Those kinds that succeed should be placed before the people, so that there will be a demand for them. No appropriation has been allowed for this year and the burden of testing and the expense comes heavy on the individual yet the experiments have gone on and a marked si - the result.

In the discussion of the topic assigned, I ask the liberty of pre senting the interests of the Western half of the valley. M perience during the last thirty years has given me a better ac quaintance with the Western half than with the Eastern portion Our ■ i already quite familiar with the work done by mini erous successful orchardists in the Eastern half of the state tribu tary to the Platte Valley. A somewhat extended acquaintance with the sub-irrigated lands of the Central Platte lead to the feeling that these are among the most valuable in the state fo orchard purposes.

These lands have a lower altitude than the best fruit lands of Colorado: with soil of unexcelled fertility and will no doubt in the near future give profitable returns to the skillful careful cultivator. We may also say that the table land - ing the Platte Valley are proving to be very productive of choice fruit when skillfully planted and cultivated.

A few miles from this orchard you find a lage orchard planted by John Rushen. This gentleman has attained a wide local reputation, growing apples, cherries, plums and peaches of excellent quality. In North Phelps county we find a thrifty orchard planted by C. J. Nelson. There are 5,000 trees and two vine-yards in this plantation. Rather more than 300 miles of Omaha, in Lincoln county, Mr. H. Otten has been grow - ing fruit for many years. By careful selection of varieties, us - ing only those adapted to this locality, Mr. Otten has found it quite practicable to grow fruit of excellent quality in commercial quantities. This gentleman also finds the strawberry, a very profitable crop, his plantation this season yielding 8,000 quarts of euch size, color and quality that up to the time I visited him he had not sold any of the fruit for less than $3. HO per case. Mr. H. Kartz, Julesburg, grew strawberries in his cherry orchard that yielded at the rate of over ten thousand quarts per acre. Ir - rigated and sub-irrigated lands supply the strawberry with all needed moisture, enabling the planter to secure much larger and more profitable crops than possible where dependent on rainfall. The Hosteller orchard, west of Hershey, had yielded profitable crops of apples, plums and grapes for many years. North of Southerland the forty acre orchard of David Hunter is growing vigorously and coming early into bearing. The fifth fall from planting single apple trees gave a yield of seven pecks. The better peach trees, after being planted four years, yielded two bushels per tree. Plum and peach trees five years planted yield - ed from the better ones, one bushel each. In Dawson County Mr. M. J. Potts has an orchard that has been bearing choice fruit twelve years. Some years ago I noticed a very old peach tree south west of Lexington that had yielded by measure five bushels. At another point I saw on a recent visit two peach - of which I took particular notice, from which the owner re ported that twelve bushels were picked in one season.

North of Big Springs on the Ash Creek Bench Mr. Calhoun McCormick has planted some 1,500 trees. At Julesburg, Mr. N. C. Roth has a promising orchard. The irrigated and sub-irrigated lands of the Platte, the Loups and the Republican seem peculiarly suited to the profitable commercial growing of the strawberry. Why should it be necessary to turn our markets over to the strawberry growers of Wood River, Oregon or those of Utah or Colorado, when we have equally fertile soil, as favorable climate, and abundance of water, with which to grow strawberries equal to those shipped from above noted points. We should note that these lands lie along through trunk railway lines with daily express and fast freight lines, giv - ing quick connection with the best markets of the country and protected by 500 to 1500 miles of transportation. In the hands of skillful planters, aided by an abundant supply of hard labor, these lands planted in small and tree fruits should become more productive and profitable than those of Oregon, Utah or Colorado. HOW A TOWN MAY BE MADE BEAUTIFUL. BY MKS. W. H. CLEMMONS, FREMONT, NEBK. The object of beauty is manyfold. It is not merely to please the fancy nor to enhance financial value. While these two objects appeal to the individual in the making of a town, it means vastly more. It has an educational and moral influence that ia unsurpassed. iv What we Hie," says Ruskin, "determines what we are, and is the sign of what we are: and to teach taste is inevitably to form character, and the entire object of true educa - tion is to make people not merely do the right things, but • the right things." If we lived only for ourselves, little would be required, "for life is as a vapor that appeareth for a little time, and then van- </seg>

But even in the short space allotted to man lie may implant principals that are eternal, and he who instills the highest morals does the most for his community. There is no limit to man's possibilities, says one, only as he limits himself. J. Sterling Morton whose name will be handed down in history 88 the founder of Arbor Day did a truly great thing for the Home surroundings depict character most legibly. No soont do we cross the threshold of a home new to us than impression are made, either favorably or unfavorably. An unkept house i no more repellant than an uukept town, and the stranger seekin a location begins with comparisons, enterprise, neatness, beaut\ social and educational advantages enter largely into his mind i making a decision. The lack of any one of these qualities is point against. Whatever tendency effects a community, whethe it be a virtue or a vice, will visibly manifest itself. It may b the love of art, or it may be the lack of it. The contagion wil spread in proportion to the energy or lack of energy of the peop] and as iirst impressions are most lasting, it is necessary that th stranger who comes within our gates be favorably impressed wit the first view of our town. Details will be considered later. The elements that enter into the making of a town are, indeed numerous, and each one deserves special attention. Among th most important, however, are architecture, lawns, pavement &gt; curbings, trees, lights, sewerage, and last but not least, paint and the proper application thereof. The neglect of any one i these impairs the value in point of beauty and finance. It pay to keep property in the best repair. Ab the people make the town, so the character of the people make the town what it is, either homely or beautiful. Wealth need not necessarily enter into the making of a beautiful home wither is it necessary to the making of a beautiful town. Th man who has sufficient energy to build himself a comfortabl lome has the power of making it beautiful and attractive. It ma &gt;e only a three or four room cottage, but it can be made to dis &gt;lay taste, refinement, and culture; in fact, be an object lesson t </seg>

Instances might be sighted where property belonging to a man of means, in either residence or business por - tion of the city is unkepc and unpaved, and yet held at so high a figure that a neighbor who would be glad to purchase it and im - prove it cannot afford to pay the price. A single lot may de«. troy the beauty of a whole block. In other instances we may cite you to men who work for a dollar and a quarter a day, who spend an hour or two each day in the improvement of tbeii and home until it becomes a veritable palace in point of cozineu and attractiveness, hence, I emphasize the educational value of beauty and the training of the mind to like that which is bea.uti - ful, and to dislike whatever is crude, haphazard, or unattrae On the other hand, a man of means imbued with the spirit of pro - - has an immense advantage over his poor neighbor, and many a town owes its high standing to the push and enterpri - one man. What a railroad company does for town depends largely upon the enterprise of its citizens. We have all learned by experience that we get little in this world without effort. Depots and the adja grounds belonging to railroad corporations are often in an in - ferior condition, simply because of the indifference of the citi/ An appeal for something better generally meets a response. As a rule, you will find this property in keeping with the town, and in many instances far surpassing. Ther to be a general clamour for wide streets, and all will admit that a wide street well kept, well paved, sidewalks and curbings in trim, is highly commendable. But there is another side to the question. In our towns, should the council vote to pave one or two of our lead - ing residence streets, perhaps a general objection would be raised because of the expense, which is largely due to the width. In such a case a narrow street well paved is far more beautiful than the broad, unpaved one, and the appearance may be quite the same if the houses are sufficiently removed from the street. However, the expense of street paving can be greatly reduced by parking </seg>
            <seg id="p044">44 either on the sides or through the center, or both, and I would emphasize that nothing adds more beauty to the streets than does the park effect. An illy curbed street detracts greatly from the appearance, and whatever else is lacking, see that the curbings are in order. As to the quality of paving, brick or asphaltuin he most desirable, and perhaps, most generally in use at nt. To my mind nothing is prettier than a brick pavement, but the quality of material must be duly considered, and nothing but the best paving brick should be used. The asphaltum, some - what more costly, is highly commendable, but by all means pave -treets, and with the best and most substantial material that the town can afford. It will enhance the value of property, save work after the first cost, and add much beauty as well as convenience to the town. I have in mind a town of six thousand inhabitants in one of uiiddle states that has several miles of pavement. The streets are not wide, though sufficiently so, and are beautifully and ar - tistically kept. To go back to the old way would depreciate the value of property, destroy the artistic effect, and while there may have been objections to the expense in the beginning, certainly the old way would be most objectionable. From the above men - tioned town the following reply was received in answer to in - quiries concerning the improvement at that place; namely, "Our ts are sixty-six feet wide and in most of the streets the sidewalks are eight feet, the lawns eight feet, and the paved portion of the remainder. In the business portion of course the entire t and sidewalk are paved. We are using vitrified block brick for paving and sidewalk. It is the best material that we can tind. It makes a beautiful street and the best considering ex - e. Of course Asphalt is the most pleasant street, but is more Msive and not so durable. This is pronouncedly the cast and ave used no asphelt here. Ten inches of sand for a founda - tion and a layer of vitrified block brick is about what we have all our town. For curbing we use Oolitic Lime Stone or Flag- Lime Stone from two to four inches in thickness, and I think about twenty inches in width. Streets built on this plan in- </seg>
            <seg id="p045">45 eluding sidewalks and lawn cost us about six dollars per lineal foot, three dollars on each side of the street. If we were build - ing a new town or laying out a new addition where it would be anything like popular I would insist on the streets being eighty or a hundred feet in width, thus leaving more space for lawns. If there could be a lawn in the center of the street it is a matter of great beauty." Another thing that enters largely into the beauty of a town is its public property, courthouse, schoolhouses, post-office, city hall, parks, churches, etc. These need not necessarily be ele^ though it is a paying investment for any town to build as eleg ly as it can afford; but certainly I would not advise an extrava - gant expenditure of public money. The location of its public buildings and the keeping of the grounds will do more to enhance the beauty than elegant architecture with unkept surroundings. To my mind none of these buildings should be set directly on the street, and the space intervening should be as large as the town can atford. The grounds can, at a comparatively small expense, be made most attractive. Nothing is more refreshing and r« than grass plots here and there in the main part of town where we are so unused to finding them; and trees, flowers, and shrubs tastefully set do much toward raising the standard of intelligence and moralitv. The passing of the fence is, indeed, a most commendable im - provement. Since the town cows are no longer allowed to roam at will there is no necessity for the homely fence with it - gate and creaking hinge, and yet, we have a few who hang ou to this relic of protection regardles of appearance, but it is safe to prophecy that ere long the fence will be a thing of the past in every well regulated town. A few drinking fountains should be erected at convenient stations. These may be highly ornamental and are really a necessity that should by no means be overlooked. From a humane point of view animals may be spared much suffering, and the fn of water from a fountain does much to relieve the monotony of dry. dusty pavements, and no town, however small, can atford to </seg>
            <seg id="p046">46 be without at least oue public fountain. There is nothing so cheap so beautiful, and so attractive, and with which nature has been so lavish iu variety as trees, and yet, we in western states cling to the box-elder and catalpa most tenaciously, neither of which is particularly beautiful, though I must admit that the dense foli age of the box-elder is unsurpassed for shade. The catalpa is the last to unfold its leaves in spring, and responds to the first frost in autumn. Yet our western towns abound with these shaggv . perhaps, because we are impatient and do not allow time to figure in the making of shade, and yet, in our fertile soil the elm, linden, ash, and hard maple grow with surprising rapidity and are more durable and beautiful. I would recommend that in the making of a town a variety of trees be planted, with per - haps the elm or hard maple predominating. They are stately and graceful and if trimmed high will produce a most elegant wood - laud effect, and no town can afford to have its trees grow low, either from a sanitary or artistic point of view. No street uor lawn is complete in artistic effect without trees, a sufficient num - ber of well kept shrubs, vines and flowers. The town is not re - sponsible for these on residence property, but must appeal to the individual, and as beauty is contagious, there is nothing that will do more to promote the upbuilding of a town than a friendly riv - alry between its citizens in the beautifying of property. The more nearly we approach nature the more artistic the effect, aud we may obtain many valuable lessons along this line by observ - ing the best parks in our large cities. This can be carried out in a smaller degree in our own home town with most pleasing effect. Factories, shops, and mills may present a neat appearance, a well as a business, where there is less traffic with teams. The piling of debris and the growth of weeds can well be obviated Depi in which water stands in a veritable pond after a rain are both unsightly and unsanitary.

I Mr. Chairman: I have no paper, I was just expecting to re a little off hand talk. I have had considerable experience th trees along the l'latte Valley. As to kinds of trees for ■eet or ornamental purposes, I would say it is not so much the nd, as it is the way in which they are planted and taken care Almost any kind of a tree does fairly well provided it is jnted right. It is not to be wondered at that many towns, not getting their trees started light, get discouraged and do not continue the work. On one side of the street they will have small trees, and on the other side larger ones, in one block plenty of trees and in the next none at all, producing a very incongruous and irregular effect. I have been in Washington, and looked down its beau - tiful avenues, and the very thing I noticed particularly was its tiful city park. It is a very creditable park. Everybody there had the spirit of planting trees. After a tree has a good t it very seldom di&lt; I would recommend planting good sized trees, and if planted with continuity, it makes a very pleas - ing effect. About thirteen years ago I bought a car load of trees, and am much pleased with the results. I got Hackberrv. Linden, Sycamore and Elm. I planted a few Box Elder and Soft Maple. I think a few of them a good thing, they make a good rapid growth, but they break off badly in hard winds. We have not had many of these storms lately. It is a very difficult matter to get trees started on public grounds. IAs an example of what one has to contend with, I will men - n a case that I know of.

One of our leading brethren conceiv - ed the bright idea of setting tire to the grass and weeds in order to get rid of them, and, of course, every tree was killed. It is very hard to make people realize how little it takes to kill a tree. There is not a finer soil any place for growing trees than right here in Nebraska, from Columbus or Grand Island east. And as I said before, it is not so much the kinds of trees, but the planting and care after planting. THE SAM) CHEERY AND ITS IMPROVEMENT BY K. A. EMSKSON INTRODUCTION. The improvement of the sand cherrv is no new topic. Dr. v lias repeatedly brought the matter before thia Card, in his "Bush Fruits."' devotes a chapter to the sand ch&gt; As long ago as 1867, Fuller in his "Small Fruit Culture." said: ••I do not consider this cherry of any particular value as it is found in its normal condition, but if we could obtain an impi - variety of a similar growth and as hardy and productive, it would certainly be a great acquisition." After suggesting that the sand cherrv would undoubtedly crow readilv with the common cherries. Fuller adds: -Here is au opportunity for the enterprising and skillful horti - culturist to revolutionize cherry culture, and lie who first prod a fruit equal to the great Bigarreau or Early Richmond d and borne upon a shrub no larger than a currant bush, will not only have his name handed down to posterity but will be likely to gather golden harvest for his labor." We are still talking about the improvement of the sand cl but have made little more than a beginning in the real work of improvement. The sand cherrv was first introduced to the trade by C.

It will l&gt;&lt; that the points of union between the stock and the scion are more or less swollen. Specimens of these trees have been planted in orchards at the Station but it is yet too early to say anything of their behavior there. The buds of Early Richmond and English Morello cherries were set in sand cherry stocks at the same time the plum buds were set. These cherry buds seemed to set. but none of them grew. I understand that cherries have been made to grow upon sand cherry roots but there seems to be little affinity bet this stock and the common cherry. s.\Nl&gt; I'HKKKV IIVIiKlDs.

The only Other hybrid that I hare seen advertised in nurserymen's catalogs is ••What-is-it," intro - duced by J. W. Kerr of the Eastern Shore Nurseries. Denton. Mtl. This hybrid was produced by Mr. Williams of this State and is supposed to be a hybrid of the sand cherry crossed by the Wild Goose plum. Mr. Williams lias produced a large number of hybrids between the sand cherry and various plums, but so far as I know none of these have been in - troduced as yet. A few hybrids between the sand cherry and unknown varieties of plums have been produced at the Nebraska Experiment Station, and seedlings of these hybrids are now being grown. None of these plum sand cherry hybrids, so far as I have - them, are of any value in Nebraska or at least in the eastern of the State. All of them have the very astringent taste of the worst of the sand cherries. In size of fruit they are intermediate between the parent plant*. Mr. Williams has a number of second -generation hybrids, that is seedlings of these sand cherry plum hybrids which produce good fruit, but those which I have seen are so much like plums that they should be ■ d witli them, and. so far as I learned, have no particular advantages over plums. Notwithstanding the fact that the results so far obtained by hybridizing the sand cherry with plums are not especially fa able, we should not despair of getting valuable varieties in this way. If enough second generation hybrids (seedlings of the first hybrids) are produced, some valuable combinations of characters ought to be obtained. Personally, I can see little advantage to be had from crossing sand cherries witli common American plans, since the plums are hardy and productive and of better quality than the sand cherry. If the sand cherry could be crossed witli the Japanese plums or apricots and a hybrid obtained which would approach these plants in fruit and at the same time have the hardiness of the sand cherry, the results would be of decided </seg>

This is one of the weak potato in the Japanese plums and apricots. Whether it will be possible to hybridize sand cherries with Japanese plums and apricots I cannot say at nt, though I believe that this can be brought about indirectly at . through the use of the sand cherry plum hybrids which have already been obtained, if it cannot be done direct, I The writer does not know of any hybrids between the sand lerrv and the common cherries. Attempts made at the Experi - ent Station to hybridize the common cherry and the sand ch&lt; ive failed. Although botanists classify the sand cherry with e cherries, nevertheless its affinities horticulturally, both in graft - g and budding and in hybridizing seem to be with the plan. uller's prophecy with reference to the improvement of the sand lerry through hybridization with the sour and sweet che ues not seem likelv to be fulfilled. IMPROVEMENT BY SELECTION. I It is by selection that the most immediate results in the impr&lt;&gt; ent of sand cherries are to be expected. At present, at '.• ree or four men in the Northwestern States are working a: is line. Professor Hansen of the South Dakota Experiment ation is leading in the work, having tested many thousand in - viduals and selected plants of special merit. At the Nebra xperiment Station a few thousand individual plants have beenfruit - l and about a dozen of these selected as having fruit i erit, seedlings grown from pits of tl -ted plants are now •owing on the Station grounds. The original plants, about a dozen in all, were obtained Professor Card from Longpine, this State. Since these plants were taken at random, it happened that none of them prod new fruit of special merit. Seed was saved, however, from the of these plants, and it is from these seedlings that the do/.i ed plants were obtained. It will be another year before tin second generation from the wild plants can be tested. Bu&lt; </seg>
            <seg id="p054">54 &gt; of the .ml cherries which fruited last year have set in plum stock. The characters of the sand cherry which make it desirable for of Nebraska are its hardiness, late blossoming, productive - and drought resistance. In its native habitat in the sand hills the sand cherry grows from a few inches to two foot in height. As grown at the Experiment Station, ou rather low. rich soil, the bushes often reach a height of five or six feet the third rear from seed. Both in the sand hills and as grown at the Experiment Station. the plan; ry productive, often being bent to the ground with their load of fruit. The fruit varies greatly iii -hape and quality. Not only do the fruits vary in size but the pits of some (if the largest fruits that are found averaging three quart - t an inch in diameter, are no larger than the pits of some of the lest fruits. The great draw back to the sand cherry is the quality of the fruit. The average sand cherry has a very astringent, or puckerv. . which does not disappear when the fruit is cooked. This quality is especially noticeable in fruits which are not thoroughly ripe. Among numerous seedlings it is not uncommon to find in - dividual which show ver\ little of this disagreeable flavor, but when such an individual is found the fruit is apt to lack flavor entirely, being very insipid to the taste.

To them the word Nebraska brings forth visions f great herds of cattle, sombreros, and broncos. These expositions are our opportunities to make clear to their minds that we are not entirely dependent on short grass or long homed cattle. In 1898 at Omaha we exhibited 108 varities of apples, 156 of plums, and in all nearly 500 varieties of fruit, embracing nearly everything grown in the temperate zone. Our aim at St. Louis, being largely to advertise our product* we should endeavor to make a display exhibit rather than scientific one. While there will be many premiums to compet for and those in charge should be able to install a thoroughl competitive exhibit, yet a part of the display will not be com petitive and should be made as attractive as possible. For th Omaha Exposition we gathered such fruit as had developed nice ly for our exhibit, but little attention was given to growing fruit expressly for exhibition purposes. That is now being done and believe will prove one of the greatest benefits we shall derive froi interstate competitions. The exhibitor that wins premiums on Poland China pigs pos - sibly began back two or three generations to develop his ideal and his ideal is always a correct one, for good exhibitors are nee rily good jadf Our horticulturalists usually go out and look for the finest speci - mens of fruit without ever having given a thought or a moments time to developing those fine specimens. I trust some labor will be given this year to developing fruit that will be a boon to the state and a credit to the individual.

Through the skill of the hort lturists our tables are supplied with health giving fruits am vegetables. Horticulture, and its attendant arts, form the van guard in the forward movement of country life . They stand fo the beautifying of homes and the development of the aesthet sense of the people. The rich of the crowded cities are seekin fresh air, beauty and the broad expanse of nature: to counters the intense and artificial life of the city. Why should not tl humblest farm house be made attractive and homelike by tl growth of trees for shelter, and a garden to supply its table? is more a matter of knowledge than of money investment. This state has developed from an almost treeless plain with its endless monotony of landscape into one of rich farms with corufort - sble homes surrounded by wind-breaks and ornamental trees. From one vast prairie it has been converted into farms with gardens and orchards yielding their bounteous harvests to the skill of the in- </seg>

The growing of fruits and vegetables was necessarily a ma of education. A multitude of failures accompanied the tii - forts. The trees were not hardy in this new enviromenl em men coming here to farm did not understand how to con - moisture by cultivation. It is not surprising that success came ( lv. A new horticulture had to be - ;try. Out of the multitude of failures and the few successes came knowl - edge. We are reaping the results of the labor of the pion Your society through persistant labor has acquired the know which will successfully extend the fruit growing belt so that . areas of the state now practically without fruit will have an abund - ance for their home ■ The farmer is in better position today than ever before to grow orchards and trees. The profits of his industry have made him ■ nably independent. He can now secure varieties which are hardy in this locality, trees which are grown in local nurseries up - on their own scion. He knows that cultivation is necessary to retain the moisture for the tree and has ample proof that cultiva - tion forces rapid growth. The aesthetic sense of the people also grows with their abilit to gratify this desire. People are building better bouses am surrounding them with wind-breaks and ornamental trees. Sti they need teacher*, men to whom they can go for advice and in struction in order that their efforts may succeed. The pioneer in this good work an ing of special credit for they hav worked out many of these new problems for all generatioi come. The horticuituralist has been a pioneer in the problem of till - and much of our knowledge on this subject is due to him. </seg>
            <seg id="p064">64 NEBRASK HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY The wheat or corn crop requires culture for a single season am dies. If it is favored by summer rains, it often flourishes withou scientific tillage and needs not to be protected against the vici* situdes of winter. But the orchard must stand the heat am drought of summer and the blasts of winter. The horticulture ist must not only store moisture for summer growth but he bum ripen the season's growth and then provide moisture sufficient t prevent damage from winter drought. No problem which con fronts the farmer can be neglected by the horticulturist, and score of problems which concern the farmer not at all, are vita to his success. The arguments for an agricultural education apply with specia force to the man who is to follow horticulture as a pursuit. Th School of Agriculture stands for advanced knowledge in all agr cultural lines, and the Experiment Station is ever seeking fo new truth to build up the homes and promote prosperity of th the people. The advancement of Horticulture then should stanc as a special duty of our school. This society should be a missionary, preaching the need of hese better things to the yonmg men and women of our state and spreading information which will lead to the more successful cul - ure of fruits and vegetables for family use. If a knowledge of lorticulture can add to the health and pleasure of the family on he farm, it will be a great factor in inducing our young men and women to live upon land rather than seek employment in the cities . Th' d idea of farming is to own large tracts of land, with the rise in values incident to the development of the country. ■oung men are discouraged from attempting to buy a farm. lorticultural practice teaches us how a profitable business may In - conducted on a small area of land. This encourages land owner - ship as against either tenant farming or the desertion of the farm or the city. This new building to be devoted to the promotion of horticul - ture will give much needed facilities for the work. The experi - mental work being undertaken at this station should reeeii </seg>

As practical fruit growers, aud gardners, we invite your co-operation and advice, in order that the work of this station shall touch the practical needs of the people. We also solicit your united support in the building up of these interests in our institution and our state. This can be most effectually done by sending out from the school young men trained in the practical problems of horticulture, and in the aesthetics of home building. Prof. Bailey once said,— "A conception of beauty lies mostly under a man's hat." One man sees so much lumber in a tree, another sees cords of stove wood. The man with trained aesthe - tic sense sees beauty in the graceful spreading branches, and com - fort in its refreshing shade. We should train our young men and women to see not only cord wood but beauty also in their visions of the future home-life in Nebraska. We are glad to welcome you here to this institution today. We have thrown away the keys of the institution, as you may have heard, and we turn this new building over to you. We give you the freedom of this building, only asking inasmuch as your in - dustry flourishes in the sunlight, that when you come to us, you come in the broad day light and not at midnight.

The work of the Horticultural Society in this state is great work. Our fathers looked out over these prairies am called them The Great American Desert, but here today we mee and talk of horticulture, and how to make these farms better am the farmers happier. Laying aside the commercial side of horticulture, it becomes one of the highest occupations of man. He who grows fruit to add to the pleasures and luxuries of his loved ones, becomes more worth}' of their affections. The horticulturist goes forth to enjoy the health giving sunlight of Heaven, to revel in invig - orating, tweet scented breezes from the orchard. Be studies nature in the growth of trees and plants in the budding bloom and the ripening fruit, and is carried to the highest plane of human existence. We are building up in this Great American Desert happier am &gt;righter homes; and a contented people with happy homes are reater stability to our national purpetuity than great nsriei Jreat navies are all right in their place, but are useless withou &gt;appy homes to protect. This year there will be much more in : in the line of the horticulturist in carrying forward ou tate work, and we will have the great St. Louis Exposition t any our fruit to and thus show to the world what we can do. &gt;raska has for the last thirty years been able to compete with the very best horticulturists in the United States, or in the world for that matter, in taking premiums. It will be a surprise to many of you to look up the number of actual prizes Nebraska has taken. I trust we will all put forth our best efforts to grow something which will be a surprise to the people of St. Louis and the world. I believe it will be possible for us to grow fruit for other st; uch as it will be for us to grow fruit for our own people and make them happier. This Horticultural Society will have another work which we ought to carry out. and that is, there are so many people who are </seg>

I believe the great mass of people, whenever a jm comes to them with propositions they do not understand, should write to Mr. Emerson or to our Secretary, and tind out wh&gt; the things that they claim are correct. I know that a few j ago there was a certain gentlemen who went through the country with a new variety of Winter Peach and sold them for a good price. They would call on farmers and get large ordt-i though the peach was worth!- There are many old varieties under new names, and it M the duty of the members of this Society to look after this matter. I trust that the work of the society will go forward in good shape, and in connection with our Experiment Station, that it will not be long until we have a building much larger than this present one. It is almost impossible to accommodate the n bers of our Society who are present here tod Assuring Professor Burnett and his worthy colleagues or Experiment Station that the work of the horticulturist thrives best in the mid-day sun, they need fear no night marauders, and thank - ing you for your attention and wishing you all a very prosperous year, I will close.

            <seg id="p068">68 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Mr. President and Ladies and Gentleint-n : This subject given me is rather a ticklish one. There are so many people in the State of Nebraska that have despaired of commercial orcharding for various reasons. Some are succeeding and some are not feel - ing exactly right financially. It has only been a partial sue So I am going to give you the experience in the part of the state I live in, then I wish it discussed by those who live in different parts of the state to give their idea from their own experience in their part of the state. 1 think this will be much better than for me to try to speak from every part of the state and only give a general view. COMMERCIAL ORCHARDING. BY «,. A. MARSHALL, ARLINGTON. This old subject has been discussed so many times that I hard - ly deem it advisable at this time to go into details as to the prep - aration of the soil, planting, cultivation and care of the orchard, but take a brief look at the condition of orcharding in this coun - try and see where we are at. When, in consulting government reports, we note the large num - ber of apple trees planted in these west-central states in compari - son with the small yield of fruit, we at first wonder why, but we readily see that this is due, largely, to a great per cent, of the trees being under bearing age. Yet the yield and quality is ma - terially reduced by the depredations of the Codling, Moth, Apple Scab, etc.. which are allowed to develop unmolested and even aided to a great extent by rubbish and filth, which is allowed to accumulate in the poorly attended orchards, which furnish breed - tag places and shelter for apple enemies. Then, further, the rough and tumble way in which the apples are picked and put on the market does cap the climax and complete the year's job in our Nebraska orchards. However, I firmly believe this type of or - charding has seen its best days; that it will never again p ou that lofty pinnacle of satisfaction that it has in the past. The time has come when the orchard must be looked after </seg>
            <seg id="p069">69 as carefully as other parts of the farm. The man who lifts the mortgage from his farm by producing pork must surely keep the Cholera from his herd; must daily watch it and see that no dis - ease whatever creeps in. This hog is unwell and must be remov - ed and have special treatment. That one must have a little extra feed, and probably the whole bunch must undergo a course of medicine to bring them in the best of thrift. The owner knows that all this must be looked after with the greatest of care or failure is certain. He must know his herd much better that the average orchardist knows his orchard. Yet we all point to the hog as the great mortgage lifter, and justly so; yet we all understand that in order to succeed he must have the above care and attention. The orchard has been too much* of a secondary matter. We are apt to expect first class returns with second class care. Were we to fondle and nurse our orchards like they do on the Pacific Coast and in the irrigation districts of Colorado, Utah, etc., no doubt the returns would be very satisfactory. In those sections they are largely driven to special farming because they cannot quite cope with us in the production of the standard meats and grains. We are in too good a country here for rapid develop - ment in orcharding. All we have to do is to tickle the soil and we can grow anything we wish in the line of an annual crop, and harvest it and get the returns in one year. The lazy man pairs of raising an orchard because it requires the expenditure of too much time and energy, yet, he will grow grain, potatoes, etc., as a matter of necessity. The nervous, impatient man. tires of waiting ten or twelve years for good returns from his orchard, while he is reaping a crop each year from the balance of his farm. Thus we can readily see that it is only the patient, tree loviug person, who studies his orchard and gives it needed attention, the same as other parts of his farm, who will attain the highest degree of su&lt; 1 believe the appearance of the orchard y. will prove a benefit to the good orchardist because he will | better price for his first class product, thus getting large returns for good, intelligent labor, and letting the sluggard reap as he </seg>
            <seg id="p070">70 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY sows. He, who wishes to grow apples for market and yet does not care to be continually bothered with marketing them, should &gt;lant the entire orchard to only a few varieties. Then, when a variety is ready to pick he will have enough worth while and the arge buyer will seek him instead of he being compelled to market. Winter varieties are preferable for sucli a grower as they ar not no perishable and can be sold more readily in large quantities lowever, the specialist should have apples ripe for the earlies market, with a succession of varieties throughout the entire sea son. By encouraging the early market the summer and fa pples will be found to be very satisfactory. For the last thre or four years ours have been even more satisfactory than th winter varieties. They are apt to be more free from worms, an&lt; n fact nearer free fromanv defect and require less grading. The apple is easily deserving to be crowned king of all fruit and the United States grows the best the world produces, whic fact the old countries are rapidly finding out. Our export trad is proving this. The central states are furnishing thousands o barrels for the European countries. Portions of Nebraska hav already proven to be as good apple producing districts as any pa of the central states. The apple orchard has come to stay, firmly believe it will return more profit in the future than it now or has in the past. At home the old orchards have bee satisfactory and there is no reason to believe the youn orchards will not do as well. Wo have kept track of one of our young orchards, an eight acre tract planted in the spring of 1893. It was planted on the hit and miss plan, about thirty-four by thirty-six feet with fillers both . containing a thousand trees. We cropped to corn and beans* the first three years. The fourth year cultivated with no crop. The fifth year cultivated in corn. The sixth year it was cultivated the fore part of the season and mowed the latter part. The remaining years it was mowed three times each summer, al - lowing the grass and weeds to lay on the ground. The value of the crops have balanced the labor to date, leaving the first </seg>

Eleven times $24.00, $264 for the eleven years, plus $100 the value of the trees when planted, to be paid by fruit. There was no fruit accounted for until the year 1899, when we picked and sold 100 bushels, $75.00. In 1900, 150 bushels, $11" 1901. 250 bushels at an average of 80 cents, $2' 800 bushels at 65 cents. - '. la 1908, 1200 bushels at 65 cent&gt; 0.

However, we have begun thinking already and in three or four year* expect to have the orchard reduced to abou* They will then stand about 17 by 3»i feet apart and oar intention is to leave it that way. We have also kept account the past four years of a certain part of a 21 year old orchard, planted for family use. This part contains 12 Ben Davis, 5 Utter. 5 Wealthy and 1 Windsor. The twelve Ben Daris in 1900 yi&lt; 120 bushels, in 1901, 80 bushels, in 1908, 95 bushels, in 1 bushels. Total 455 bushels. Five Wealthy, 15 bushel 13 bushels and 60 bushels, respectively.

Total 190 bushels. This makes a total of 888 bushels off the 23 trees in four years or 207 bushels per year or 9 bushels per tree. This shows what can be done when everything is favorable. The location is ideal for a fruiting orchard, being high land with good air drainage. Good wind-break on the south and moderate the balance of the way around. We simply mowed the grass and 'wo or three times per year and allowed it to remain on the ground; cut awaj the water sprouts and broken limbs and sprayed thoroughly* each spring.

All the farmer has to do is to tickl the soil and we can grow any kind of a crop. The lazy man despairs of raising an orchard because it requiresthe expenditur of much time and energy, but he will grow grain as a matter o necessity because he likes to live from hand to mouth. I believe that the appearance of the apple farm will in tim &gt;rove to be a benefit to the good orchard ist. There is no coun ry where we can grow a young tree as readily as we caa here We have enemies in our line of work just the same as the mai who produces pork.

When we lay down and say thes enemies are too great, then we become weak horticulture Mr. Marshall — In regard to the Windsor apple, it is called the Mclntosh by the American Association of Nurserymen. It was given that name at Omaha. That name followed it, and we sent it to Paris and won the prize on it there as the Mclntosh. We have it run down now as an old variety of apple. Member — In regard to spraying, when we spray for scab we ase Bordeaux mixture, but when we spray for the coddling moth we use the Paris green. In our home country we always had lots of fruit, and we took good care of our trees in the old way, but as you all know the fruit this year was very poor. In re - gard to the Mclntosh, 1 think it is a seedling of the Snow. It fully resembles it. It is a fall apple and a good keeper. It was introduced by Mr. Plumb of Wisconsin. It has red streaks in the apple. Mr. Whitford— I have no accurate method of naming my fruit but 1 am glad Mr. Marshall has given the names of my trees. 1 will say that I got from Mr. Plnmb of Wisconsin, among other lots, four trees. I knew nothing in regard to them just as many of us in the early dayB knew not much in regard to the new varieties. Lately these tree commenced bearing; not much the first yeai&gt;. but I soon found after the tree came to maturity, that it commenc- DISCUSSION. </seg>

That April blizzard killed all my other varie - ties, and I suppose it was on account of their being a little later. I believe it equal to the Ben Davis to sell as a late summer or early fall apple. I am out of patience with the Cooper appl&gt; got that from Mr. Plumb, too. I don't like the Windsor because it confuses in shipping. All I thought of was to get a name for that apple. I did not care what the name was. I give you my knowledge as to the name. It was on the label. I am satisfied that as far as I know now it is one of the best trees on our place. I am disappointed in regard to the apple scab. It has been in our country for the last few years. 1 want some remedy that I can understand. I want to know how to use it to combat this disease, because I do want to stamp it out. I think the apple in - dustry is very much damaged. Up to this last season, or so far as my knowledge goes, this Windsor apple has never scabbed to amount to anything. This year it has scabbed a little; and the Ben Davis quite a little. I am here to get information on the apple scab, and if any of you have any information I hope you will give it. The President — If anyone has anything to say on this subject let us have it quick. In regard to what Mr. Marshall said, in talking with the older horticulturists of the state, I find that it occured in 1863, aud has never occurred since. Mr. Marshall — I might say that we expect to prune the trees and girdle them and kill them at the same time. There was such a radical change in our weather that we did not have time to carry out our program. Next year we will girdle and get all the fruit we can. One thing I must say if you have not got the grit or courage to cut them down don't plant them too thick, for you will never cut them out. I like to cut them out. It is the right way to grow them.

We are cutting out in the thicker places, and shall go on doing so, even if it draws tears from a wooden Indian. Mr. Whitford — In regard to spraying I have sprayed fo apple scab. Last year I sprayed with Bordeaux mixture the firs time used one-third; then I sprayed two weeks later with just th Bordeaux mixture, but I found it did very little good. Eitht I did not spray just at the right time, or the season was worse It may be possible that it would have been a good deal worse i 1 had not sprayed twice.

Mr. Hogg — I would like to ask in regard to the red ceda and the scab. I have been toll by those who grow the red ceda hat there is a fungus growth which comes from the red ceda ree and that produces the apple scab, and that if we want ou apple trees safe we will have to cut down the red cedars. 1 wai o know if I have to cut down my red cedars in order to save m apple trees? I have a few red cedars that are large enough t lave a fungus growth on them. It will hurt me to cut those rec cedars down. I would like to know if the scab is caused by th red cedars; The President — I believe, as a general thing, that it is the rust on the leaves, and not the scab that causes it. Mr. Emerson — Mr. Scott is here and he can answer this for us. There is a rust on a good many apples, that is, it is among the list of diseases, but the scab is a different thing; it is not connect - ed with the red cedar rust at all. Mr. Yaukk — I want to say in reference to the last paper that it is the practical things that the fruit grower wants to know about, the practical results that we have from others who are ex - perienced.

If we can lay claim to any one characteristic trait inherited from our pilgrim fathers, it is perhaps that of daunt: The home seeker did not hesitate to push on into western Nebraska where he quickly found that the supply of moisture was not sufficient for his needs. The discovery was of untold value, for it drove out the weak kneed speculator, and left the dauntless home maker. The latto learned that if Nature did not have quite enough moisture to gt around in the way of cloud distribution, what did fall could b erved by the Campbell system of soil culture, and irrigatioi would furnish the remainder.

Horticulture goes hand in hand with agriculture; and the de - velopment of orchards in the irrigated sections of Nebraska has been no less remarkable than the progress of agriculture. Fruit and small fruits are making homes homelike today where </seg>

Of such import - ance does the home mak. fa his orchard aud fruit garden that in many cases he furnishes special irrigation for them, I ing to Nature to provide for his farm crops. IRRIGATION FROM RKSKKVOIKS. One method is to irrigate from reservoirs supplied by p&lt; plants such as windmills or gasoline engines. Both are now manufactured with such cheapness and power as to be practicable where water does not have to be lifted more than 25 or There are many valleys in Nebraska where an abundant supply can be found at this depth. It has not been found best to irrigate directly from the « mill. Such a process requires almost continual attention, and the evaporation i- ve while watering from so small a stream. Any fanner can scrape out a reservoir holding from 2,(MX 5,000 barrels. Bj tramping and puddling the wet surface of the banks and bottom with horses or cattle he can guard against - age. Into this reservoir the windmill can pump all night without attention. From it a head of water can be obtained of sum size and force to irrigate quickly and effectively. Dan Myers, of Sargent, has li &lt; »ir stocked with tisl; I sharp demand for all he can furnish at 15 cents per pound. During the winter he puts up enough -"I'l'b" tnt ' town.

Of the 4i,000,000 acres within the boundaries of Nebraska, 0 have been found by surveyors to be available for ditch irrigation when the waters of the streams are properly utilized. Eof successful orcharding under this form of irri - ion are so many that perhaps only a few instances that have le under our own observation need be given. I In one orchard near Sutherland, 317 miles west of Omaha, um trees five years planted, produced a bushel of fruit. Peach Hm four years planted gave two bushels per tree. Missouri ppin apple trees yielded a bushel and three pecks the fifth after planting. One orchardist near North Platte grew 8,000 quarts of straw - berri immer. Some parts of his plantation were from 5 &gt; old, showing that under irrigation plants produce fruit for a longer term ot lan under natural rainfall. Iln Loveland, Colorado, I saw a two-acre raspberry plat that J built a comfortable brick house for its owner; $1,600 worth fruit was sold from the two acres in one season. In Scott's Blutt's county the orchard of Ed Scriven, 20 miles from the Wyoming line, is making a record which should encour - ern fruit growers. From single apple trees he sold last $10 worth of fruit.

MECHANICAL SUB-IRRIGATION. Twentv-fiv' ago Prof. Harvey Culbertson, who had charge of Horticulture at the University of Nebraska, gave a : deal of attention to mechanical sub-irrigation, produced by laying a net work of drain tiles under the ground, to be flushed with water from the surface. It was urged that the water so ap - plied would not be depleted by evaporation in the sun and wind </seg>
            <seg id="p079">79 ORCHARDING UNDER IRRIGATION and that erery drop would perform its full duty. About that time A. J. Sawyer, of Lincoln, installed this ayt - tem under hi- gavdm and floral designs. The tiles were flushed at night with a hose. In the morning the surface of the ground would be found damp from the rising moisture which had thoroughly permeated the ground. The results were apparent in the wonderfully brilliant floral effect The expense of this method, however, is such as to limit it to ornamental grounds and the growing of such vegetables bear the expense of costly production. NATURAL SUB-IRRIGATION. Without doubt the best form of all is the natural sub-irrigai found beneath the valley lands of the Platte, Republican and Loup rivers. This process is carried on entirely by Nature. Like most of her methods, it is the best obtainable. In June, when the rivers reach their highest, water ri&gt;&lt; the valley lands within I to t; feet of the surface. This furn an abundant supply of moisture by upward seepage, tb all irrigation, during the growing . It covers the fruiting hi of small fruits, enabling them to produce fruit of largt Later in tl; when the rivers are lower, the wai cede, allowing the newly made growth to ripen.

Orchards grown on sub-irrigated lands seem to live longer than others by reason of proper winter conditions. The Black - burn orchard, 1+ miles from Kearney, on laud six to eight feet above water level, is '20 years of age and still producing fine crops of fruit. In l90i, &lt;iO4 bushels of the crop sold for |489. In ad - dition three families were supplied with 100 bushels more, mak - ing a total yield of about 700 bushels. This from a little less than one acre. Peach trees are supposed to be short lived; but trees 23 to M - old are still living near Lowell on sub-irrigated land, and fruit last season, despite the sleet storm. Jonathan apples of large size and most brilliant coloring are being grown on land of this kind six miles south of Kearnev. Since the supply of moisture is unlimited and never failing, lands are especially adapted to the production of small fruits; 90 to '.*."&gt; par cent of the composition of strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, currants and gooseberries, is water. It is lack of moisture that dwarfs fruit. If the plant can fill its berries with an abundance of water while ripening, the fruit will arge, attractive, and salable at high prices. TREES FRUIT EARLY. Fruit trees in central and western Nebraska under irrigation commence bearing at an earlier age than those in the eastern part of the state. This is not the result of irrigation alone, but because of atmospheric conditions. The evaporation of water from a given surface in one year in astern Nebraska is SO inches. Going westward the evaporation ncreases, until in the drier atmosphere of western Nebraska the nnual evaporation from the same water surface is sixty inches, 'his condition acts upon trees in a peculiar way, checking exces - ive growth and causing the formation of fruit buds. When the tree begins bearing, the abundant water supply sup </seg>
            <seg id="p081">81 ORCHARDING I'M DEB IRRIGATION ports it while fruiting freely, and at the same time enables it to set a full crop of fruit buds for the ensuing year. Trees subject to these conditions therefore, come into bearing earlier than I grown under natural rainfall, and fruit with greater regularity. OUTLOOK ENCOURAGING. The outlook for orcharding under irrigation is bright indeed, and is keeping pace with the growth of irrigation itself. The next fifteen years will see the development of important orchard interests in the irrigated sections of the state: especially in the Platte river valley.

(ApplaiiM Now, if there is any discussion on this paper, any questioi ask Mr. Stephens, let us have it now. When Prof. Burnett was making an object lesson to this Soci - ety and showing how to raise fruit on the farm, he impressed me that that was the only work he had to do; that we could not hope to become a commercial state and supply our own market. I think he was not quite familiar witli the Horticultural | of Nebraska. The time is coming and not very far distant when hall raise fruit to ship in commercial quantities out of our state and supply the needs of our own people too. As you get out over Nebraska into the Northwest and see the fruit, the great trouble has been freight rate has been too high. We are par - ticularly favored with conditions, and it is proper for us to go right ahead and ship to these states mentioned. Nebraska will furnish enough fruit for her own people. Our county alone shipped one hundred cars of apples out of the state and sent them to New York City direct.

The Secretary may probably be justified in inviting the writer to prepare this paper because of his residence of nearly twentv - tive years in Richardson county. The acceptance of the invit; may possibly be justified by the hope that the observations made and experiences had during those years may be of profit to those interested in horticulture in that part of Nebraska at the pr. time. No doubt the most valuable knowledge is gained from one's own experience; but, it is nevertheless wisdom to learn all we can from the experience of others. In 18t&gt;8, the farm which has been my home for a quarter of a century was bought by an eastern man, and the following year a portion of the prairie broken up. In 1870 the owner moved on the place and set out the first fruit trees, consisting of a small family orchard of thirty apple trees, composed of fifteen or teen varieties. Soon after a small number of peach trees were planted. A few years later ail orchard of two or three hundred apple trees was planted and destroyed by the grass-hoppers, the same year. In 1878 a second planting of nearly three hund - red apple trees was made. When I came on the place in l s 7'.» this last planting at once became my care, and thus began my experience in orcharding in Nebraska. Aside from the planting of various small fruits, and a few plums, pears, cherries, mulber - ries, etc., my subsequent orchard plantings have been as foil In 1N91, five hundred apple trees; in 1893, one thousand apple trees; and in 1895, five or six hundred more apple trees. About this time several hundred peach trees were planted in apple orchard, alternating in the rows. Without entering into the details of the various plantings, i varieties, location of ground, distance apart, methods of cultiva - tion, etc., I deem it of more importance for our present purpose to state the conclusions arrived at from my own experience and the observations made on the work of others in this section of the state, during my residence here. </seg>

Our apples excel in beauty and flavor any raised east of the Mississippi river; and though the western coast of America and the irrigated plateaus of the west can equal us in the beau: their products, the quality of their apples is far inferior to that of • uirs. I Though we can raise this superior quality of fruit, and every irm should therefore have a small family orchard ; the planting f commercial orchards on any extensive scale should be confined ) th( -ssed of a special love for horticulture, and who caii evote much time to such work, or to those who have ample leans to employ interested horticultural workers. There is no usiness which to be successful, needs more the personality of M worker than the business of fruit growing. Th- -sful •uit raiser must love his trees and their products as well a* the ollars which he receives as the reward of his labors, and have most solicitous care for the former if he would enjoy the latter. Our best orcharda have been those planted on good, rich, well illed upland prairie; the trees set cot less than thirty feet apart, and two and three year old trees have given much better satisfac - iou than one year olds. It has been found more difficult o protect very small trees from rabbit lieu protected by wrappings they present too much surface to the wind, and con - trary to expectation, they do not seem to recover from transplant - ing and establish themselves as readily as the older trees. It has been found an excellent plan to place peach trees in the rows north and south alternating with the apple trees, as their quick growth and denseness of limbs and foliage prove8 a great protec- Eon to the apple trees from sun and wind, causing them to grow uch more erect and form much better balanced heads. The should be headed low, and what pruning the orchard re- </seg>
            <seg id="p084">84 eives should be given while the trees are small. The orchard hould be kept well cultivated for at least five years after plant - ng, and in doing this, potatoes or corn may be grown between the rows. Corn has the advantage of shading the ground in heat of summer and also of protecting the trees to some extent from he hot winds, and as the orchard should never be used as a &gt;asture for any kind of stock, the corn should be cut up and muled otf. The ground devoted to orchards should receive abundance of fertilizers, especially if cultivated in corn, and noth - ng is better than good manure from the stable or barn yard. Nheu the orchard begins to bear fruit, it is more convenient and seemingly as well for the orchard to seed to clover, and mow at east twice a year, and that the clover may be a continuous crop one of the mowings should be when there is ripened seed to leave on the ground. Every year or two the bearing orchard should ve a good coating of manure; this may be hauled and spread on, to the best advantage when the ground is frozen in winter. The result of this work will be very manifest in the superior size and quality of the fruit. Some advocate planting more than orty or fifty trees to the acre, but the advantages of greatt number does not materially increase the amount of product, am as the age of the trees increase the advantages are more tha overbalanced by the inferior quality of the fruit and the unhealth of the trees. The best results seem to be obtained by givin abundant room for sun shine and circulation of air, beside th necessity of having trees far enough apart to allow the passin hrough of team and wagon in gathering fruit and for spraying. The greatest enemies to our apple crop at present are the cod - dling moth, and the fungus commonly called apple scab. Spray - ing with London Purple or Paris Green, and Bordeaux mixture do much to over come these enemies, and would no doubt do much more if used in every orchard instead of ouly in a few, while those unsprayed remain as recruiting stations for the enemy.

The man who prefers to raise a crop of corn to other farming because he has bo much leisure time between cultivating and harvest time will make a success of orcharding. The raising of trees and harvesting their fruits requires as inuc vigilance and almost as constant care as the raising of live stock which needs to pass under the eye of the owner daily. The ma who finds his chief delight in working harmoniously witli natur to produce her marvelous creations, if possessed of enthusiasm and industry, can succeed in orcharding. He needs to be an op timist, else the long waiting for the first fruits, and the frequei damage from insect enemies, from hail storms, untimely f and other untoward circumstances, will discourage him. and a his enthusiasm wanes, he neglects his business, and conclude that orcharding does not pay.

It a] that any tree that grew rapidly during the previous season, suffered a great deal by the May freeze, while trees that had grown slowly, seemed to have more vitality. One of the worst things we have to contend with here, is I think, the tree trunk becomes diseased on the southwest sidt notice this in apple, peach, plum and cherry. I know of but (im - practical way to prevent this, and am giving this method a trial. It is Ion' head'oKj. In putting out trees, I plant deep, and then ut off about six inches from the ground, leasing the ground low - er around the tree as this will gradually till up by cultivation. I am trying this method, with apple, peach and plum. How I will ucceed I will report later. If this does not save the trunks, that ive having any, I don't know what to do, i • build a louse over them. Of the apples raised here, undoubtedly Ben- Davis heads the list, while the quality is not all that could bo desired, the fact remains that it sells well, while Genet will not sell for more than one-half to two-thirds of the Ben-Davis price. I I will pay to raise Ben-Davis, Winesap, Duchess, Whitney N. and several of the Russian sorts, if grown close to the ground, as a protection against wind, hail and the south-west sun. I believe it is just as necessary to grow peach, plum and cherry close to the ground, and for the same reason. We may ha get a new apple and a new peach, something originated under our conditions, before we can make the success that we wish for. Seedling peaches seem to be hardier than the budded trees, and are often as prolific and bear fruit of good quality. I have seen fine apples that were grown in this county, the trees from seed brought from Russia, and I intend to im this particular case. How are we to get these low headed trees that we desire?

I have a young ineyard consisting of about an acre;, and while I sold $50 worth of grapes last year, it little more than paid for labor performed. Still I feel encouraged as I believe this was the largest grape crop in the county, and this in a very bad season. 1 noticed one thing in particular, that the part given the culture, produced the best, and this was very marked, in the part that was given the best cultivation the year before. I did not lay my vines down, and lost but very few. This time I have covered some vines, thrown a dirt mulch around some and let some go. There is no school like the school of experietu I have one-fourth acre of currants and have had one good crop. I irrigate them when I think they need it, but they don't grow as well as they ought to do. I am manuring them heavily this win - ter and will see what effect this treatment will produce.

Nursery men are inclined to be bom I rule, and they want to do the very best for the people they can to get fruit trees ow and raise fruit, but somehow or another, the kind I am speaking of are all gone. You will find that men, somehow, in some way. become a little selfish. They kind of consider the matter which pays the best. They absolutely lose sight of the point that the men who buy the trees want to plant them. </seg>

That is a fact. This gentleman is a nurseryman and knows how to handle the grafts. He has a nice orchard, but if he under - takes to teach the people how to do'that he will be older than he is now, and have a bigger job on his hands than ever before. The nurseryman will grow a low-limb tree, but as quick as the farmer gets it he cuts off the low limbs and trims it up. The </seg>

Mr. Bkltzer — That is the same old story but it has got the "low" bump on it. The man who does not know enough to plant blue grass has not got sense enough to grow fruit, and if he is so careless that he cannot cultivate them he better not plant a tree. Mr. Yager — In regard to the high or low-limb tree, the nurs - erymen are raising the kind of trees the farmers are asking for. I think the Society has usually recommended the low limb tree — that are headed low, but if you raise that kind and deliver ,&lt;liem to the farmer lie is scared to death and wants a high limb like he used to have back east. I think the nurserymen in this state are generally raising just the kind of a tree that the farmer should have. A Von k — As regards the height of fruit trees, I think there is a great deal of difference in localities. In Pennsylvania we to head them way up in the air, and it was all right; and, I think in the eastern part of Nebraska we can head them higher than they can, perhaps, farther west. I myself think they ought not to be headed too low. They hang down when they bear. In order to prevent blight or nun scald, I think we ought to protect our trees while they are young, until they have formed a top, and we can do this by tying them up with slough grsi - corn stalks. That will answer two purposes . It will protect airaint rabbits and also against the sun. I believe it will be a good way to overcome that difficulty. Mr. Barnard — When your low-headed trees come into bearing you will have the low limbs tilled with apples and they will hang down lower. There is one advantage in regard to low-headed -and that is it prevents sun scald; but there can be said against it that when they commence to bear they hang down too low. If we can shape the tree to prevent sun scald we have gone a great ways towards growing orchards in the state of Nebraska. tl think our Society has been inclined on the side of low-head One gentleman said a few years ago that he would )w them on vines if he could . </seg>
            <seg id="p093">93 Mr. Andrews, Keokuk, Iowa — I have had some experi&lt; along this line, but I don't know very much about this country. The great point to be observed in setting out trees is to set them with the heaviest top to the southwest and have them lean over that wav. Mr. Williams — I think there is a happy medium about this trimming and cultivating of trees. I was engaged last winter in going after low headed trees and I found it almost impossible to get the fruit and I could hardly get into the tree and I cut off those lower limbs that almost touched the ground. It seems to me that there is a happy medium in this matter. Mr. Pollard — This is a very interesting subject. As Prof. Burnett says, this society is rather a school of instruction to the rest of the people, and you should be careful about correct reports going out and not to publish any false doctrine. This idea of heading trees low, depends a good deal upon the character of the tree, I think. Here is one man who wants the tree right at the ground, headed low. I don't want them so low, as when they get to bearing, the limbs full of apples bend down and they get lower every year. When the tree is low-headed, the fruit is away from the sun and the light and it is tasteless and green and worthless. A Jennet apple grown on the lower limbs is nearly worthless, and the same is true of the Jonathan apple, as to its taste. It depends upon what part of the tree it grew: if grown on the lower limbs, it is taste. We start the branches low, say three feet from the ground. In Pennsylvania they trim a tree up so that you can ride a i uuder. That would not do here. On the contrary, with the very low headed tree you would have to get down on your hands and knees when you go to pick the apples. You don't want to plant trees so low headed. You don't want to start them that way. Start with a medium high tree. If you start with a low-ht tree, you will have to cut it away and cut the lower limbs off, be - cause you will get tired of crawling around on your hands and knees picking the appl&gt; In trimmiug trees, we leave live branches.

If there are any branches running up, we let them grow If there is a limb that begins to sag and hang down, we cut tha limb off. In that way, we keep the tree in very good shape, aiu ■we can get around and pick the apples without trouble. Mr. Andrews, Keokuk, la — I have had some experience along this line, and when I came here to Nebraska I did not know this country very well. I should say that it was the better way I out a tree with the heaviest top to the Southwest, to have it lean ter that way. If you will go into the old orchards of twenty years mdiug, with low-headed trees, you will find the rows straight. I Mr. Whitford — I have only had thirty years" experience i Nebraska, and I am very much interested in this discussion o imniiug trees, and would like to give some of my experienci am not going to give any theory. I have set out between th - ud six hundred trees in all. Thirty years ago, 1 did not know ut very little about the conditions, but I thought I had my t immed properly. I cut the tree from the start. I cut them u erhaps four feet, the lower limbs. I left them that way an&lt; icy appeared to be what you might call very nice trees. Th jsult was that about live or six years ago, as Mr. Pollard sa\&gt; le limbs hung down; and I could not get near them. I could no get under them to pick the apples. I found that I had to cut ot the lower and larger limbs in order to protect my orchard, no entirely from insects, but on account of the fruit, and there wl too much top. If I had been a young man, I might have ci he top back. I presume you could trim both ways, but I trin ned them from below and the result is that within the last tiv vears I have taken off one half of the limbs. Some trees wi stand to have more limbs taken off than others. The Jenne and several other varieties, I have trimmed away ; east one half of the top. There must be care exorcised iu th matter, but if the foliage and limbs are too thick, the fru will be small. It depends upon whether a man wants a nice looking tree of not. If he does, he must cultivate it and he must cut the limbs </seg>
            <seg id="p095">95 DISCUSSION up out of the way, so that he can work around under it. If lie don't care to cultivate his orchard so much, he can let the limbs grow longer. I have given my orchard intense cultivation, and I believe that is the proper way. Some people cultivate and trim up as high as a horse's back, ho that they can drive under with the mowing machine. I believe gentlemen, one of the best things you cau do, is to cultivate an orchard, and cultivate it thoroughly. I believe in trimming. While it does not look neat and business like to allow weeds and grass to grow, I am going to try it and mow them down and allow them to remain, and so pass back into the soil by way of fertilizing. Mr. Stilson — This kind of discussion we have more or less every year. Those who want a high-headed tree are the only ones who are willing to advocate it. The conditions between the rn and western parts of the state are so different that must be studied carefully. The conditions that we find 25 or 50 miles east of here are so different from what we find 75 miles west that there is no comparison in the manner of growing t Low-headed trues are the only ones for the business in the so far as my experience goes. To advocate high-headed there, is to advocate something that you cannot rai - ally. PusiDBCT —As to getting down on hands and knees, I believe horticulturalists better get down on their hands and knees and gather a few apples, than to trim tre i high that they can - not raise unv fruit at all. Mk. BracKB This is a question that seems to be ami: about heading trees. I live in Iowa and I presume you have the same kinds of trees, and that conditions do not differ materially there from the eastern part of Nebraska. I understand this is largely a school of instruction. Take, for instance, two trees, one Wine Sap and the other a Grimes Golden. Each of these varieties requires just the opposite training. Their natural habits of growth must be studied. The Wine Bi to branch out very low. Its habits are to spread, while the habits of the Grimes Golden is just the other wa It is </seg>

If you don't take particular pain n trimming that tree very low, you have quite a good dea of top exposed because the limbs do not spread out Therefore, in trimming you must study the habits of the tree.

The President — If we continue this interesting discussion further we will not have the time to listen to a paper by Mr. Al Russell of Tecumseh on the subject entitled "Spraying the Orchard." Mr. Russell is a thorough man and I am sure we will all be in - terested in what he has to say. SPRAYING THE ORCHARD. BY AL RUSSELL, TBC1 WHEN. HOW TO SPKAY AND HOW TO PREPARE THE MATERIAL This is intended more for the man with a small orchard, for I think they are the men that need the instruction more than the man with large or commercial orchards. They are looking for the best, and are informing themselves on all of the different methods and machinery for the work. Those who have not given this subject much thought may b surprised to learn that the beautiful blossoming of the fruit is no the results of warm sunshine and spring showers, but there de velopment dates back from one to two and often three year - by caring for this year's crop of fruit we are also preparing goot healthy fruit buds for the future crops. At the base of each leaf is a bud if the leaf has been kept healthy during its life to maturity it has given to the bud the vi - tality to make a strong and healthy bloomer. Now to insure this leaf, we must commence our work very early in the spring to make sure that no worm, canker or scabs attacks it, continue our work to the end of the season. It is fortunate that the same mixture answers for protection to both fruit and leaf alike. Spraying is to prevent not to cure, therefore it is essential to know when to spray. </seg>
            <seg id="p097">97 WHEN TO SPRAY. The fungi come from minute pores that are deposited on the fruit or leaf attaching themselves thereto. They begin to grow and feed upon the substance of the fruit or leaf, producing diseased spots, and abnormal growth. The effect of this on leaf or fruit is known as scab, bitter rot, bronze rot, etc. Experiments have been made to determine when they make their appearances, therefore, being fairly well informed, it stands us in hand to be on the scene a few hours before hand with our spray to catch them before they get in any of their work. But the time depends somewhat upon the condition of the weather. If rainy the more they hasten, as they develop faster than in fine weather. My time for the first spraying and which has given me very good results is just as the buds begin to swell. I use bordeaux and paris green. The second spraying should be done just as the bloom has fallen and I think this is the most es - sential and important of all the season's work for the codling moth. Then I continue to spray at intervals about fifteen to twenty days apart as near as the weather will permit. The last spraying about the twentieth to the last days of August. I think the liquid spray the best way of applying the poi- Get a spray pump with a gnod agitator and then use pleir force to be sure that you make a tine spray, and be sure that every part of the tree not only the leaves, but every limb and the bodv are covered with it. I have an orchard Monarch Sprayer, which 1 think would be hard to beat. It is driven by chains from the hind wheels of the wagon, on which the machine is mounted, consequently is always ready when your team is hitched to it. The wheels are four and one half in tiro, consequently do not cut your ground up in ruts when wet. A little boy that can drive a team can also work the pressure lever and drive. One man stands upon the tank, which enables him to spray the upper half of the tree and the other on the platform with the machine, he has a good show at the lower half. We drive slow, </seg>

We can spray about seven hundred and fifty to eight hundred Eees per day besides mixing the material and filling the tank with ater, which holds one hundred and fifty gallons of water, five ines each day. tThe same company make a fine hand pump with the same kind an agitator and screen brush, all the same as the large one ex - pting air chamber. But if a man has five hundred trees to spray, he cannot afford to fool with a hand pump. MIXING THE MATERIAL. My spray tank holds three barrels and it takes twelve tanks o thirty-six barrels of material to spray my orchard of thirty-fh acres, so I weigh up four pounds of lime for each barrel, makin one hundred and forty-four pounds. I slack this about three o four days before I want to spray. When I am ready to spray divide my box of slacked lime which has become firm by th time into twelve equal parts. While the boys are filling the tan I weigh up twelve pounds of bluestone, place it in a bag mat of burlap and have a kettle of boiling water to pour on to tl stone through the mouth of the bag, which I hang in a five ga Ion jar. It will dissolve it in five minutes. I now weigh m paris green and pour just enough water on it to make a thic paste of it, stirring it well till it is all wet up. I now thin m lime up till it is about like milk. I use a one-half barrel or barrel cut iii two for this. When the lime is ready 1 pour th vitriol water into it, stirring well as I pour. Add the poiso mixing all together well and you are ready to put your materia into the spray tank and commence operation.

Now, I sold three hundred and fifty barrels of Winesaps, as fine as I ever saw, to Armour Packing Co. for $1.10 per barrel, which amounted .to $385, when my neighbor only one mile from me had about the same amount that he could not get any more than the worth of the barrels oat of it. So you can see I had $331.50 out of my Winesap crop alone for my work to say noth - ing about 500 barrels of other varieties which were equally as good. Well, you will say you have not counted the cost of the machine. Well, I will ask what crop can you raise as much money out of with as little machinery as the apple crop '. I have not said anything about canker worm, which if let alone in a few years will take every orchard. Two years ago when I sprayed the second time the trees were covered with them and in three days you could not find one and there was but a few to be seen this year.

Q. — I am simply speaking of this to get at the expense of using bluestone. My young orchard does not come into &gt;earing yet and I only sprayed that over once; and the balance of 22 acres I sprayed five times at a cost of $34.80. In the last hree sprayings I did not use but about two pounds of bluestone o the barrel. I use four pounds usually. I am not so particu - ar about the lime. I often times take five pounds. I think the more lime you can get through the nozzle the better. Q. — Were your apples comparatively free from scab after this spraying? A. — Two years ago they were entirely free. We did not have any apples this last year in my orchard. Two years ago the Ben )avis, and Jennett were comparatively free from scab by spray - ng, but last year it did not have any effect. There was too much rain last year to be any success in fruit raising. This machine can be used by almost anybody, and can be operated in passing from one tree to another.

Q. — Mine is a hand pump and we cannot break any, but with horse power, it seems to me it might damage the machine some. A. — There is a dial on the machine, the air chamber, that shows the amount of pressure. When you get up to 20 pounds that is all the pipe will stand and you have to stop. Q. — Would you use that same strength for the plum as for the other fruit; A. — No sir; I would use considerable less strength. I never have sprayed for plum from the wagon on account of difficulty of getting through the orchard. Q. — What per cent of the apples were free from worms? A. — I could not answer that. I sold my apples to Armour Packing Co., two years ago. They went in and picked what they wanted and they did not pick anything but what they want - ed, and I sold them 900 barrels of apples. Me.

Mr. Stilson — My friend Hogg spoke about somebody going through the country representing himself as the U. S. iu peddling a spray for this rust and fungi. I think there was such a man traveling through the northern part of the state. I think I found his tracks, and I ran across him a while ago. He came to my place and asked if he could sell us the formula. He repre - sented that he was agent of the United States Government in - troducing this formula, i says, my friend I want to say to you that the United States Government, when it sends a man out in - troducing a material, they send him out to introduce the material free. You cannot sell me your formula. I think, perhaps, this is the same person Mr. Hogg spoke of. Mr. Hogg — This person I met was at Kearney at the Summer meeting. Mr. Stilson — It was less than three months ago. He said he was introducing a fungus and rust formula. Mr. Hogg — I brought up the question at the Kearney meeting in regard to fungus from the red cedar. He told us it was what we called the apple scab. I understood him to say that if we had apple trees along side or uear red cedar trees that we would always have the apple scab. I talked with the gentlemen after - wards at Sheltou, and he said we would have to cut down the cedars. Mr. Leake— In regard to apple scab I think as Mr. Russell that the most good is just before the leaf first comes before the buds open is the time. The President— The spores of the apple scab are invisible. Whenever you see the apple scab on the tree you might just as </seg>

IMr. Hogg — Have you had any experience in spraying for rly leaf? Mk. Williams — I have used the dust spray Mr. Hogg — Three years ago my trees had curly leaf so that the leaves of the peach trees dropped off. Next spring 1 got a circular from the Government stating that they were putting out a book that treated on spraying of the peach tree. I sent and got the book and I sprayed my peaches with blue vitriol and lime. I think I used five pounds of blue vitriol and four pounds of lime. I sprayed in very early spring before the buds opened in March. That season I did not see a curled leaf. I also sprayed last spring and did not have any. Before that every spring I had curled leaf. IMr. Swan — In regard to red cedar business, we had a couple professors from Lincoln come out to our country. We took an over the country there and to Mr. Russell's orchard. He d one large cedar tree that was covered with these balls and it 3ms that they went onto the apple trees close to it. I supposed sse fellows made a tour of the country and that they would ike a report here of what they saw. I think Mr. Russell has e red cedar tree in the middle of his orchard that has that Qgi. If he has to cut down all the cedar trees to get rid of at one trouble, I would rather do that. The President — Of those parties who were through the country, I believe one is in Pennsylvania, they have all gone where they get a better salary. They were after another disease, but found this. (Mr. Barnard — There is one thing that ought to be taken up this time. We have always waited until the next day before ring it attention, and, that is, the appointing of the committees, le committees ought to be appointed at this meeting so that ly could commence on their work.

            <seg id="p105">HORTICULTURAL HALL 105 Mr. President — We will listen to the resolution. The resolution was read by Mr. Camp. It was moved that the matter of the resolution be given special order of business at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning. Mr. Barnard — As we have a program I would move an amendment; that the resolution be referred to a committee of three of which Mr Camp be made chairman. The amendment was accepted and the motion adopted. The President — I will appoint on that committee Mr. Camp, Mr. Emerson and Mr. Marshall.

HORTICULTURAL HALL The President called the meeting to order and announced that the first paper was on the subject of "Pruning" by Mr. T. E. Snodgrass of Johnson county. Mr. Snodgrass had no written paper on the subject, but gave illustrations on the subject from a number of trees on hand for that purpose. No intelligent description can be given of the many ways in which he said he would trim and prune the different trees that were presented, each one requiring special remarks. During the course of his talk he said that the man who under - stood pruning, and did it properly, assisted nature. He said that in one short minute a person can take off a limb that it will take nature years to grow. Many trees are spoiled for want of proper trimming at the start. We prune trees for various reasons, to give them symmetry, and balance them up on all sides, and, in this windy country, to make them short and stalky so that they can bear fruit. ■ ln, Nkbraska, January 20th, 1904. </seg>
            <seg id="p106">106 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY As to the size of a tree to plant; 1 would not care to plant a tree larger than about $ of an inch thick. I would rather pay a nurs - eryman 25 cents for a tree of that size than I would for either of the other sizes; besides that tree is symmetrical. In regard to water sprouts, we are advised to destroy them, but I want water sprouts in my orchard. I find that I can use water sprouts to a good advantage. Q. — What time do you advise pruning apple trees? A. — if I could do all of my pruning in one day, I would do it just before the sap starts in the spring; but you must take your own case into consideration if you have a lot to do, you must commence early. IQ. — Would you prune in January or February, if the weather warm. A. — Yes, I have pruned in January. Q. — You prune at any time your knife is sharp; I A. — No sir, not at any time. You can't catch me on that. As ■egular time, I would prune when I can rub off the buds, but I tuld not take of! any limbs in June. I Mr. Snodgrass gave a practical illustration of the proper way trim the roots as well as the branches. His remarks were very itructive accompaaied by the practical illustrations. DISEASES ARISING FROM IMPROPER PRUNING. It is not my intention to deal with pruning in its various pha tl will endeaver to make it my business to show the results of erent pruning and more particularly of careless pruning. Wounds result to trees from many different sources than from pruning, as from animals rubbing, etc. The wounds in these cases are jist as serious and many times are the source of the same diseases as those resulting from pruning. We will only consider se made by pruning proper. We are apt to think that because a tree does not cry out when BY CLABK E. BELL, YOEK. </seg>
            <seg id="p107">107 DISEA8ES ARISING FEOM IMPROPER PRUNING injured as a person does that it is not greatly hurt and that it does not react. The tree responds to every injury and the stronger the tree the stronger the resistance. And what we want to do is to put ourselves in such a position that we will aid this resistance. This probably can best be brought out by showing how the op - posite is done. There are four common cases of careless pruning. First, a branch is cut leaving a stub of various lengths, from one to five inches or even more. Second, a limb is cut from above and in pulling off peals the bark for several inches. Third, the breaking off of a branch, leaving a jagged surface. Fourth, dead branches are left on a tree, or what is commonly called, natural pruning. It is not that vitality is lost by these careless methods of prun - ing, but that a part of the wood is left exposed. The tree im - mediately responds. If it is a conifer, resin is allowed to escape from the ducts and soon hardens into a crust on exposure to air. Among the hard woods, as soon as a limb is cut, the heart and sap wood, are exposed to the air. These as you all know, have no power of healing in themselves. The growing tissue of the tree is confined to a very small portion, just underneath the bark, called the cambrium, which is held in check by the bark. Now on as you cut the limb, you relieve the pressure on this growing tissue, the cambrium, and an excessive growth takes place,covering the wound with a mass of tissue, commonly called callous. The end of the old stub remaining as sharp and distinct as ever. This process takes considerable time, varying with the size of the limb cut. Thus in the first case mentioned, of a stub beiug left, the callous tries to cover the stub up and even if it is able to do this, in which case the stub must be very small; it will require considerable time to do so. The wood then exposed dies, cracks and checks. The surface collects the dust which with the dead cells make a thin soil in which germs find lodging and sufficient moisture for their germination and growth. It small beginning but soon forms better conditions for wound rot . Bacteria are prominent in this first slow process of weathering but later as decay penetrates deeper are only secondary. They </seg>
            <seg id="p108">108 seem to prepare the way for fungi most of the toadstool kind which can be seen on almost any decaying log. The fleshy part seen are produced at the surface for the reproduction of spores, their reproductive bodies, while the plant proper is beneath the bark or within the tissues. The fungus spores are blown by the wind and after finding lodgment, as described, germinate. This germination consits in sending out a few delicate threads from the spores. These threads enter the moist decaying parts, branch considerably and at first confine themselves to that part which is already dead. As they get stronger and well established, they induce decay of themselves. They gradually cause the conditions for the entrance of more air and moisture which in tarn prepares the way for the fungus threads to grow farther. This way en - trance is forced to the trunk and then extended indefinitely throughout the trunk. These fungus threads, by means of certain chemical changes extract the necessary food matter from the plant cells and in return a complex chemical change is brought about in those fibres. These changes brought about by fungus are commonly spoken of as rotting. They destroy the mechanical properties of the wood, which is thus ruined commercially, and if not cut will soon blow over and become a breeding place for other diseases and insects. Wood, however, in the early stages of decay, may be used as a low grade of timber. And in some cases may make very good posts as the fungus stops growing after the tree is cut. A good example of this is the soft rot of the catalpa (Polyphorus-versiculor). The trees attacked appear to be in the best of health and until the tree is pretty well decay - ed the presence of the disease can only be recognized by the holes left by rotting branches. Later, after the vegetated filaments of the fungus have extracted a sufficient amount of nutritive material, the fruiting bodies appear on the bark or the old stub. Where the holes are of considerable size, it is almost certain, that the tree is unsound. Ants and boring beetles soon make a complete hollow. Woodpeckers easily remove the pulpy decay - ed wood. The fungus changes the heart wood into a soft spongy mass, completely destroying the wood as far as the decay extends, </seg>
            <seg id="p109">109 D1SEA8E8 ARISING FROM IMPROPER PRUNINU while the tree is standing, and making it incapable of withstand - ing any strain. But if the catalpa is cut while the disease is in an early stage, it can be used for posts, as the growth of the fungus stops when the tree is cut. The same fungus is found on many other trees and as countless thousands of spores are dis - charged by each every year, the chance of infection is shown to be very great as the spores float about very freely in the air. The rate of decay has never been accurately established, but large areas have been known to be infected and rendered useless within fifteen years. Even after the wound is covered the fungus threads may continue to extend themselves into the wood reach - ing the heart and causing the trunk to become hollow as, I found one box elder tree along one of the Lincoln streets in which a dead stub had decayed and fallen away, leaving a hole consider - ably larger than your two fists. Look out there are great numbers of these toad stool fungi, some being peculiar to a single species. Thus it would hardly pay in a discussion of this kind to take up the minute discussion of each. The second and third cases of careless pruning mentioned, that of pealing the bark and leaving a jagged surface aie simply cases of the rougher the surface the greater the likelihood that disease will gain an entrance the same as in the human body. If a surgeon leaves a ragged shattered bone uncovered, disease of some kind is naturally expected. But in surgery, bacteria is about the only danger. Then how much more dangerous in pruning where the patient is subject to bacteria, various kinds of insects and many fungi? Thus a man who leaves a jagged stub in a tree; i&amp; no less a criminal in nature's eyes than a surgeon, who leaves a shattered bone uncovered, is in the eye of the law. The fourth case, that of natural pruning. The limb becomes weak because the shade is too dense. It is then robbed of its share of the food by the limbs above, and it dies. It is then a source of danger to the tree, particularly those trees upon which the branches stay a long while after dieing. Insects and diseases, as described above, gain entrance to this branch which may render worthless the whole tree. Ants, termites and many </seg>
            <seg id="p110">110 NEBRASKA 8TATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY beetles preparing the way for fungi. Old trees when pruned are more subject to disease than younger ones which are more vigor - ous. This is'illustrated by the fact that later in their life all •a become infected. REMEDIES The most effective remedy would be the removal of conditions which favor infection. This is easiest done by avoiding any un ggary wounding of the plants or trees and the immediate treatment of any wounds rendered necessary in pruning or othe operations. Dressings or applications to the wound canno directly hasten the healing process, they may aid it by prevent ing decay and thus save the tree. The surgeon applies an anti septic to prevent contamination. Thus in pruning we must appl' a dressing to preveut disease and let nature do the healing. The -ing according to Baily must have two properties, first, it must check the weathering of the wound; second, prevent growth of bacteria and not injure the cambrium and bark. It must be protective and antiseptic. Paint and tar are very durable. Bordeaux is sometimes used while coal tar is strongly recommend - ially for forest trees, by Prof. Van Schrank of the De - partment of Agriculture. If the decay has just started it may be stopped by removing all discolored tissue and closing the cavity, soaking with an antiseptic before and after putting in the plug, which will then heal over. Pruning in the fall or winter allows the tar to be absorbed by the surface of the wound, due partly to the dimished amount of water in the wound during autumn and partly to the consequent negative pressure of air in the tree. When pruning in the spring or summer the tar altogether fails to enter the wood, cracking and making the same entrances for insects and diseases that the wound would have done without being covered. CONCLUSIONS. Een pruning is necessitated, make the cut close, injuring the no more than absolutely necessary. Then cover with a live and an antiseptic solution. </seg>
            <seg id="p111">111 SUITABLE LANDS DISCUSSION. Mr. Bell had many specimens of improper pruning to which he referred during the course of his paper, showing diseases as the result of careless pruning. Q. — Should not all large limbs be painted* A. — Yes, sir; if yon have a large limb, or practically any limb, it should be painted. It takes a long time for a large limb to heal over. If you put something over it to keep the disease from entering, nature will heal it. Q. — Would you paint it right away? A. — I would paint it right away. Q. — Is paint just as good as anything else? A. — Yes, it seems to be. Prof. Bessey, I believe recommends it. Q. — What is the best kind of paint to use? A. — White lead. 11k. Emerson — Coal tar is recommended and if it is put on hot it is first rate, but if cold it is not so good. Q. — What time would you prune t r maples, box elders, and ornamental trees, along the line of public highways to save the trees from getting these disea A. — Just as I sawed and cut I would apply the dressing, and it will be absorbed. Cut it along in the late fall or winter and then there will be less sap or water in the limb, but if you wait until summer is will crack. Q. — Is March too late to trim tn A. — I would get at it as soon as I could The President — There is another paper that has been prepared for us and is on the program at this time.

We should study the nature of our soils and trees that we are going to plant. The apple tree is best adapted to the clay soil that we find in the cannons or draws. My observation has been wherever I find an apple tree growing on clay soil, I find a tree that is sound and healthy. The apple hang's on and matures and grows larger than on other soil. The clay soil holds the moisture better than the black loam on oar prar When we have dry hot weather in July and August the apple drop before they are ripe, unless the trees are on low ground am the roots get water. A great many of the orchards on the prair ies are dieing for want of water, that is the case with the trees on top of the hills on the rolling lands. I have in my orchard one block of 1200 apple trees. It is o the rolling prairie. There is a cannon or draw running throug it in such a way that part of it is protected and part expos6&lt; to or from the winds and storms, that may come from any direc tiou. When 1 planted the trees I told the boys that were help ing me, that we would see which kind of soil and slope was th to plant an orchard. The hills sloped in all directions. W had trees down in the cannons and we had trees on side hills am on top. The results are that the trees in the bottom of the can uon winter killed, those on top have made a slower growtl Those on the edges of the cannon and side hills on the clay so made a good healthy growth and are loaded with apples ever year. The apples hang on until matured, while those on top o th. hills, the apples begin to drop with the blossom and kee dropping all summer. By the time they are ripe there are no many left acd what are, are small and poor in quality, that is th winter varieties. The summer apples that ripen in July and August hang on and ripen fairly well. In planting an orchard care should be taken to plant all the winter varieties on the lowest ground. The low ground holds the moisture longer. The late apples have a better chance to mature. The apricot does the best on the clay soil. </seg>

The apri - cot trees are full every year with fine j fruit while those that are planted on that black loam scarcely ever bear any fruit. The The peach does the best on top and side hills. The cherry wili grow on any soil. It yields its fruit before we get the hot winds and sun. The best fruit lands we have are on our rolling or blutf lands, the more broken the better. Plant the plum in the bottom of the cannon, the apple on the foot and side hills, the peach on If there is a rough or broken piece of ground on the farm that is the place for the orchard, I was talking with a man the other day. I wanted to know why he had no orchard. He said that he had planted trees several times and they did no good for him. He thought there was no use to plant any more. I asked him if he had no bottom land on his place? He said he had a cannon of about six acres. 1 asked him if he had ever been over t&lt;&gt; Otto's to see his orchard ii&gt; the cannon. ''Why, yes! He has lots of apples, cherries a' apricots every year. I never thought why it was he always had fruit. I will break my cannon and plant an orchard in it. It is of no use to me for anythii he replied. So it is with many that have planted orchards and have had failures. They planted their orchard where they should have planted corn or alfalfa. When planting an orchard the wind break is one of the things that must not be forgotten. The trees should be protected from winds, especially when in bloom. If the tree is exposed to the wind the polen will be blown off before it is ripe and ready to fall on the flowers to fertilize them. A tree that stands out by itself, exposed to the wind, may bloom every year and scarcely ever have any fruit on it. The polen is blown off before it is matured . Some years you will find the fruit all on one side of the trees in the orchard where they are ex - posed to the wind. The fruit will be evenly distribute all over the tree when protected from the winds on all sides. In planting care should be taken to select varieties that are adapted to your locality. Some varieties will do well in one locality and be a failure in others. It is too expensive to plant </seg>

Tramp this dirt down on the roots then pour in a pail o water,and fill the hole with loose earth and leave it. Never tram on it after the hole is filled up. The loose earth acts as a mule and lets the heat of the sun down to the roots. This starts it t growing. Cultivate the same as you would corn. Keep all weit away from the trees. Corn or vines can be grown between tl tree rows for four or five years successfully after that use tl disc harrow to keep the weeds down between the trees. I hav found the hogs a great help in keeping the weeds down and th ground loose under the trees. They dig out the grubs and Jun bugs that burrow under the trees . In pruning you should be careful not to expose the body of th tree or the large limbs to the sun. »Nature has provided th branches and the leaves to protect the body of the tree from th scorching sun. We should assist nature by removing all decay ing limbs and branches and thin out where they grow too thick When the trees are young you must keep watch for Bunn\ He has an idea that young apple trees are planted for his specia benefit.

The President — Next in order on our program is the "Care of House Plants," by Mr. C. H. Green of Fremont. Mr. Green — I was asked this morning what I was going to talk about? I said "Care of House Plants." The parties said, "We don't care anything about that. You had better take your paper down to the Woman's Club." I replied, "Perhaps you do not care much about it, but your wives do." CARE OF HOUSE PLANTS. When you go into a home where there is a window full of healthy, vigorous blooming plants, don't you feel that you are in the home of a woman who is capable of making the 1&gt;&lt; everything, and who under all circumstances will bring sunshine and pleasure into the lives of all with whom she comes in con - tact. Show me a woman who has the knack of caring for 1. plants successfully, and I see one who is probably more ca; of giving you valuable advice on the subject than is the man whose knowledge consists of growing plants under glass. V a plant intended for the home leaves the greenhouse, it practi - cally passes out of my control and conies under an entirely differ - ent method of treatment and care. There are however a few things practiced by the pro! florist that will no doubt be found a help to even the skilled window gardener. Repotting, that is, changing a plant from one pot to another of larger size is one of the most important and one of the least understood operations with which the amateur plant grower has to do. When the uninitiated decide that a plant needs repotting, the first thing they generally do is to shove a case-knife down between VI 1. H. GREEN, KEKMoNT. </seg>
            <seg id="p118">118 NEBKASKA STATK HORTICULTURAL 8OCIETY the pot and the soil and run it all the way around to loosen things up. - practically all the feeding roots of a plant lie at the outside of the ball of earth, the knife method gets about all of them that amount to anything. Then the plant is gotten out of the pot in one way or another and pot into another (generally considerably too large) and filled with soil. A few weeks later Mr. Frev spends his valuable time telling why the plant is not doing well and trying to get out of iiig it for a while until it gets to growing again. To properly repot a plant turn the pot up-side-down and tap the edge gently on the corner of a table or something similar. Hold one hand on the soil to catch the plant when it comes from he pot, which it will do without bruising a root or disturbing the soil at all if proper care is taken. Repotting should only be done when a plant has grown too large for the pot it is in. It should then be put into one an inch larger. Have the new pot ready with a handful of broken brick or broken pots or coal cinders, or any similar substance in the bottom to insure good drainage. 'ut enough soil in the new pot so that the plant will be in prop - er position, that is a trifle deeper than it was before, then till in the earth packing good and firm. There are very few plants but what will do well in good garden soil which may be enriched with a little thoroughly rotted stable manure, With the larger plants such as palms, Boston ferns. Rubbers, etc., great care should be taken in repotting and it should be done only when absolutely y. There should be very little soil in the pot that is not occupied by ro&gt; icIi will become sour and cause trouble. long as a plant is healthy and is growing some there is good n to believe that it does not want repotting. Never under any circumstances take a plant from a small pot and put it into one a great deal larger. There are some cases where the methods I have mentioned will perhaps not answer if followed to the letter, however as in everything else brains must be used. I remember at one time I was working in the green house in </seg>
            <seg id="p119">119 CAKE OF HOUSE PLAKT8 Omaha when a lady ask me "Why, Mr. Greeu, what do you to make your plants grow so luxuriantly:!" I said ''Brains." She replied "Where do you get them, at the packing houaert" Another important item is that of watering and it is really an art to know just when to water a plant and the amount required for its well being. 1 sometimes think that this is a knack that is instinctive and cannot be acquired. I have known florists who worked under the glass caring for plants every day of their lives for twenty-live or thirty years, who could not water a hoi; - mixed plants and do it right if their life depended on it. And on the other hand there are men who can walk through a half dozen or more greenhouses and by merely glancing around as they pass along can afterwards tell you just which pla watering in each and all of the houses and such a man a knows just how much to give them. If you will take notict will find that this applies to the amateur window garden' as to the professional florist. We are often called on to answer the question i How often shall I water my plants?) Really the only answer that can ! is. whenever they need it. A mistake • many amateurs make is in watering too lightly, they pour enough water on to wet the soil on top and down to the depth of probably half an inch. When it is dry they repeat the dose and the result is that the water never reaches the bottom of the pot near which the feeding roots are found and the plant will die from drought though it may be watered faithfully every day. To properly water a plant fill the space between the soil the top of the pot full, which should be half an inch to an inch in depth according to the size of the pot. Sometimes the soil will draw away slightly from the side of the pot as if shrunken in ing in this case the water may run through without soakin_ soil and it is necessary to repeat the dose after waiting a minutes. The plant should always be allowed to become re. ably dry and then watered thoroughly. This is a ieral rule to follow.

The easiest way to get rid of the mealy bug is to brush thei otf with an old toothbrush dipped in soapsuds made of ivory soa] "or greenfly sprinkle the under sides of the leaves with tobacc lust or snuff. We have different methods which we use in green MMMe culture but they are not practical in the home. A ver mall spider hardly visible to the eye, that works on the undt ide of the leaves of some plants is another enemy that must be loselv watched. They are commonly called red spider aud the iowu by an unhealthy discolored appearance of th eaf. Sprinkling the under side of the leaf with water severa imes a day will soon put them out of business. Mildew is a fungus disease that is apt to attack some plants ially roses. It lias the appearance of a grayish powder on the surface of the leaf which will be curled and otherwise dis - torted. Apply powdered sulphur, dusting it all over the plant aud do not sprinkle plants affected with water late in the day. There are a great many blooming plants that do nicely in the window that should be more commonly found. The good old geranium that stands all kind of killing and blooms cheerfully on will be found everywhere and is well worthy of its widespread pop ularity. But the Primulas, Obconica, Chinensis, and Forbesii should be seen oftene'r. Azalea Indica is gaining in popularity fast and are one of the most beautiful of our window collections. Begonia Gloire de Lorraine is rather tender for house culture but will repay the extra care it requires.

Harrison, of York. WESTERN ORNAMENTALS, OR HORTICULTURE W OF THE 100TH MERIDIAN. BY C. S. HARRISON. The intent of this article is to encourage people in the We - part of the State to improve the home grounds, and not give up to the surrounding desolation. Many homes have been abandoned that might have been re - tained and beautified. A resident under the 100th Meridian for several years gave an opportunity to test things adapted to the West, and frequent visits to the regions beyond gave some impressions of what might be done in the way of home adornment in sections where irriga - tion could not be used. One of the prime essentials, of course, is deep plowing am thorough cultivation. It is better to conserve the moisture fo the first year and have enough in reserve to start the trees am shrubs. The range of deciduous trees will not be large for th high divides, but the green ash, honey locust and Russian olive will take the lead. These MW by far the best drouth resistor - have. I have known the honey locust to grow without irrigatio in the alkali and adobe soils about Pueblo, Colorado. Then there are the evergreens that do remarkably well v once established. The ponderous pine will take the lead b* this grows naturally and without aid in regions as dry and forbid - ding as any in our State. There is no doubt whatever that with ground well prepared and trees well started groves ami wind breaks of these trees will afford ample protection to the home. Austrian pine will also endure much heat and dry weather. The Platte cedar and scopontorrum of the Rockies will come next in </seg>

The lilacs do remarkably well and endure both heat and drouth extremely well. I had over thirty kinds at Franklin and most of them are doing well today, notwithstanding consecutive drouths of continuous neglect. The Chinese tree lilac has stood all the trying changes of the last fourteen years with the mercury rising to 112 degrees and sinking to 35 degrees below. * Of course, it would not grow as large as it otherwise would under favorable circumstances, but it grew and bloomed in all those terrible years which killed utterly all kinds of willows and as many kinds of poplars by their side. Most of the spireas are a success and can be depended on. The syringas are also very hardy and endure heat and drouth well. Peonies would do well with a little protection from the sun and wind. Columbines and phloxes are not to be forgotten. THE SCREEN. I More and more the value of artificial protection is being recog - ized. Near Mobile, Alabama, I saw half an acre of pineapples ompletely fenced in with lumber, one half of the cover left open u mild weather and closed when cold. In Florida men build heds for their orange trees. In Connecticut they are now rais - ag wonderful tobacco under cloth, and many fruit growers are lising wonderful crops of" strawberries under the same protec - on and they find it pays well. The cloth keeps off the frost and lso draws the heat and berries are much earlier. While at Frank - n I had half an acre under screen and I could raise delicate owers, evergreens and fruits, which could not grow in the open, nd the forest moss would grow there for there were forest condi - ons. I used ash poles from the creeks and for cover used wil - )w§; for cross pieces I had corn cribbing. If your walls are jlid your posts need not bejstrong as they cannot sway in the wind. For walls sod would be best as that would keep out all the wind, but if I could not get this then grow the heaviest kind of sorghum, which could be stood up for the walls and nailed </seg>
            <seg id="p123">123 DISCUSSION. solid to girts. If you can raise this long enough it would also do for cover and could be tied to the joists with binding twine. You would be astonished at what you could accomplish. While without the ground would be wind-swept and dry you would have another softer and milder climate within. You could raise fine vegetables which would not succeed on the outside. Then to, you could have delicate roses of as fine flowers as you can make grow in the temperate zone and they would bloom in delicate beauty and when the wife and girls are tired and need a vacation they can go under the screen and enter a new world of beauty and usefulness. The protection will conserve the moisture for the hot winds cannot drink it up and the sun's heat is softened. Care must be taken not to screen too heavily. I did thi - one instance and rather overdid it. Shut out about one half or one thirtl of the sun. Always put your covering from north to south, for if laid the other way you will have streaks of light and shade falling on the same spaces all day. With such a breast work as this you can fight all the a&lt;l\ ties of the climate. Under that protection you can raise your own evergreens and waiting for the right conditions. If you have to wait a year or two you can plant out in the open in nur - sery rows and so insure your little trees to the sun that in two or three years you can plant your wind break and groves with success. You cannot capture the plains by one rough rider calvary but you can lay siege and carry it by steady approaches, ami I have no doubt that with care, skill and caution our whole west can be transformed into a land of beauty. Only one must not try and do too much but do well and thoroughly what he under - takes. For fruit trees have a few and take the best of care of them, plant in a depression and water in the late fall or winter if need be and soak thoroughly. DISCUSSION.

Harrison — I had good deep rich soil and the first year I had them they grew five or six feet. When people commenced to plant them they got rid of the borer. I think they do better in the west than in the east. Me. Dunlaf — On the high land they make poor growth, but in the bottoms they are much larger than they are of the same age in this country. There are trees out there ten years old and the largest of them you can make three cuts of fence posts. Me. Davidson — I have had some experience in Sherman County some years ago. They nearly kept up with the sun flower We put them out eight foot apart and when they were four years old you could not get through with a one-horse cultivator because it would tear the harness. They would make a small post fo wire fence but they went to pieces, and they are now all gone. Mr. Harrison — For resisting drouth I don't think you can exceed the Black Locust. Mk. Whitfoed — I have plenty of honey locusts, and 1 find they are short lived and hard wood to cut. They are a great deal harder than the black locusts. It is hard to get an ax thin and sharp enough to cut it without breaking the ax. Mr. Dlnlai* — Did you try preservatives on your posts, sul - phate of copper or iron.

Mr. Dunlap — The Union Pacific railway company many years ago had to use cottonwood ties and they used them with sulphate of copper and sulphate of iron. We have a gentleman with us today who perhaps can tel how they lasted if you ask him to give the preparation they for the preservation of the wood. The President — Mr. Corbin, can you tell us about it? Mr. Cobbin — I have been on the road thirty years, altogeth - er. The most lasting thing we had in the construction of the road, or in the shape of ties, was the wood that came from Cali - fornia. The California red cedar would not rot at all, but the rails would cut down into the ties and we had to take them out. The cottonwood only lasted but a few years. They soaked them in some kind of composition. The best thing we had in the whole west, taking it all through and through, where we were working, was the pine. We got it in the west. That would outlast all the oak. Cottonwood, if it is soaked, will last much longer than it would otherwise. We soon did away with the white pine and they put in oak. When we built the road from Grand Island over to Hasting* they put the bridges in with oak caps. Mr. Whitkokd — The question is on preservatives. Mr. Corbin — No, I do not know in regard to it, but the} not follow it out. Mr. Whitkord — We want to know if we can use soft wood with preservath i Mr. Corbin — On some of the bridges we put in pine, and it lasted from 3 to i&gt; years longer than the oak.

BY IRWIN FREY, LINCOLN. t Probably no flower has advanced as much in the past ten years the carnation; caused principally by the great improvement of e new varieties in size and keeping qualities. A new carnation to be a success today must have several qnal - stronger than its predecessors in its color, a strong and orous grower giving a long stiff stem, a large flower with a calv that don't split, a prolific bloomer and good keeper, the colo whatever it may bemust bedistinct. To be sure alimited numbero fancy colored flowers may be grown with profit for retail trade but rarely does a customer ask for a dozen variegated carnations The same may also be said of the crimson and yellow variet! On a commercial place the number of varieties grown may be nore limited. Out of the hundred or more varieties now in com - nerce I think we could get along nicely with twelve or fifteen ribly with less, picking out those best adapted to our soil. To the careful grower the health of the next year's stock is always a problem of greater importance than almost any other witli which he is forced to deal in his yearly routine of work. much depends upon the careful selection and proper hand - ling of the cuttings that are the foundation of future success that no one can afford to intrust this important work to the cap and inexperienced. </seg>
            <seg id="p127">127 The most practical eye and a thorough knowledge of all the conditions that tend to bring out the best that is in this flower are none too good or expensive to be devoted to this branch of our work for every unhealthy cutting that is taken will surely produce a diseased plant and is more than labor lost. Even with the best of selection and cultivation varieties are prone to lose vigor and run out. The carnation is not a plant that lends itself readily to perpetuation by cuttings at least not under the present methods of culture under which they arc grown every day in the year and year after year without a suspense Those who know the origin of our race of monthly carnat and are familiar with its habits will admit that tli many thing in common with its an© Perha] - uany years of cultivation ondi the race will become - tomed to the conditions to which it is subjected that it will be as to perpetuate it by means of cutting without injuryii _ vitality as it * &gt; perpetuate a tea p We owe the vigor of the race solely to the fact that new varie - tre grown from seed and introduced into commerce in numbers that it takes but three or four ■ superc* variet We no more think that at last we have obtained perfection in some color or type than there comes another variety just a little better and we are forced to digcard our pet and plant a new in its place. Who can tell how long this course of improvement will i tinue and what gems we may yet obtain? When we have attained that type of perfection the race will probably be so thoroughly accustomed to its environments that tew of the characteristics of it ton will be noticeable. Until that time comes however, we must make the best of ditions as they are and spare no pains to keep up the vigor of our stock. The very best time of the year to propagate is during the two darkest mouths, January and February. </seg>
            <seg id="p128">128 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY In those months we not only have the elements surrounding the cuttings in the sand under perfect control but the stock plants from which they are taken are in condition such that we can readily detect any plant that does not ] he most perfect health and vigor, all such plants should be avoided when cut - tings are taken. Except in a very few cases we take all our cuttings from the flowering steins, not only do these cuttings make the best shaped and largest plants in the shortest time but this course if long pur - sued will give a stock that is more free flowering than will result from the practice of taking cuttings from the base of the plants. Especially have we become convinced that this is the only proper course to pursue, since dry rot has shown us what a dread - ful pest it is when once it makes its appearance on a place. We have learned by repeated experience that once any part of a plant is attacked by this disease there is absolutely no hope of saving it by cutting away the affected branch, like leprosy in the luinuin body when once its presence is seen the whole plant is filled with germs of the disease. What then must become of the cut - tings that are taken from plants so affected? Last year our plants were planted in the field early in April, having had plenty of air day and night for several days to harden them off. After being out four or five days we had a cold snap with about two inches of snow and the mercury fell to 88 degrees but the snow pr&lt; ed the plants and they started to grpw at once seemingly none the worse for their cool reception by mother earth. ne of us if we do not succeed with a new variety the first year say it is no good, while if we would note its shortcomings perhaps we would find that we were at fault for at least part of them, ami so we discard a variety that under different treatment may have proved a valuable factor to our li- We had proof of this the present winter with the variety Jub - bilee, which we bare .lowing with only moderate su veral years.

Presidknt Christy — This is a good subject to occupy our minds on. Mr. Marshall — I think we will have to try it if Brown will furnish the posts. We employ a good many Russian lab&lt; and they are familiar with the tree, as they grow in the old coun - try. It is named after the ordinary candle tree on account of the tree burning green, but that would indicate not the resin but sort of yellow substance. I do not know anything about its la qualities. Mk.

To make a success of ornamental plants and shrubbery, it is necessary, first, to so arrange the trees as to give the plants i for it is useless to attempt to grow plants, shrubs or even - where they are overshadowed by larger ones. Large grow - ing trees, such as Elms, Maples. Sycamore, Linden. Bed &lt; &gt;ak, Catalpa and Pines, may be planted along the border or in the rear. For the foreground plant Birch, Mountain Ash, Tree Lilac, Red Bud, Blue Spruce, Cedar, and the weeping varieties of Wil - low, Ash, Mulberry or Birch.

For example, a Cedar or Spruce growing by itself, or grouped with others of its kind, makes a pretty tree; but when sandwiched between larger trees that over shadow it, it soon becomes a scraggy disfigurement to the landscape. When you wish to plant shrubs or plants, enough space should be reserved to prevent the surrounding trees from robbing them of moisture. You had better have a small ornamental garden well tended than a large one half starved. Do not plant a little, weak paeonia, snowball, rose or other perennial plant in a strong bluegrass sod, and expect it to start off readily without care. The soil must be tilled around that plant for several years. Following is a list of hardy shrubs which have been success - fully grown in our locality: About the first to appear in the spring is Forsythia, whic! clothes itself in a mass of yellow flowers in April, before th leaves appear, and is closely followed by the red and yellow Flowering Currant. Then come the Lilacs, too well known t need description, and which may be had in many varieties, wit double and single, white and purple flowers. kCydonia — Japan Quince, may be had in several colors, con - icuous among which is Cydonia Japonica, with its blaze of red ooms which open before the leaves appear. Prunus Siuensis — Double Pink Flowering Almond should be in every collection. Spireas may be had in varieties blooming from early spring to autumn. One of the most beautiful of these is Spirea Van Houtteii, which in June bears a perfect mass of white flow&lt; Viburnum Opulis Sterilis — common Snowball, is too popular to need recommendation.

Most hardy deciduous plants should be planted either in the fall, after the leaves drop, or as early in April as possible, usually about from April 5th to the 10th. (In our latitude it is a mis - take to wait till Arbor Day, April 22nd, to plant any deciduous stock. ) If a shrub is taken from cold storage to the garden after afing time, the hot sun of the advance i it to leaf quickly, before it has made roots enough to sustain its top, and it wilts, and perhaps dies, during the first dry spell. Then the grower gets the blame, though the fault is often with the iner for being late about making his purchase. When shrubs let their tops should be pruned back in proportion to their loss of roots. Roses should be pruned to five or six buds. In subsequent years roses should be pruned in March. Hydrangeas and other late flowering plants which flower on the new growth may be pruned early in the spring; but spring flowering shrubs, or those which flower on the old wood, should not be pruned until after they are out of blossom. Many plants which are hardy in snowy climates are often win - ter killed here by frequent freezing and thawing. Such plants Bhould be mulched in December, or as soon as the ground is well frozen, and left covered till freezing weather is past. Hardy perennials supply the demand for cheap and permanent flower gardens, but many prefer to invest a little more and have an immediate effect.

Q. — In covering roses do you lay them down and cover them all up. A. — The first season I generally lay them down and cover them with dirt or straw wrapped around them. Sometimes we use a barrel with both ends out and put some straw in for protection. Mr. Hadkinson — I think if you cut the rose back say three or four inches, and keep it cut back in the fall and then throw dirt over it, it will winter alright. tWHiTFORD — Which side of the house do you plant Crimson imbler on? Would the east side of the house be a good side r that? A. — The east side is not so bad, but don't plant on the south side, nor too close to the house because the heat reflects back.

It is my privilege the present winter to give instruction to several classes of farmer boys — young men I should perhaps call them — in the laboratory work of horticulture. I speak of it as a privilege because it is a pleasure to me to note the interest with which a majority of these students take up with this work. It is a pleas - ure to feel that after having spent the major part of my life in this pursuit, I may be able to interest a newer generation in the peace- </seg>

It is pleasing to note the interest with which many of our farm boys attend to the instruction given in the common practical work of the garden, such as the starting of seeds in their germinating trays — work with which one would think they should have be - come familiar in their home life on the farms. The fact, how - ever, of their lack in this respect soon becomes apparent. The fact that we have upwards of 200 new students enrolled this winter in the agricultural course exclusive of the course in judg - ing most of whom are also taking instruction in horticulture, is evidence of a hearty demand for our course of work. It is in - structive and interesting to note the growth in attendance at oar State Agricultural College. Beginning in 1895 with an enrollment of 15 it has steadily advanced to its present stage. With the great - ly increased facilities offered by means of our three new buildings, now nearly completed, and a fourth one to be added in the spring, we may look forward with confidence to an era of far greater use - fulness for our College in the immediate fnture. That there is abundant room for still greater growth through larger appro - priations may be seen by comparison with the colleges of our sister states. It is not, however, so much a question of how great our equipment in both building and teachers as it is of how well we use tlusin. There is a growing conviction in my mind that our agricultural schools are not doing nearly the good they might with the pres - ent equipment. We have only been looking after the farm boys. How about the city boys* Why not give them a chance to se - cure a rural education? We have the winter course for the country lads and lasses. Now let us have a « &lt;e for the city boys and girls. Have you ever thought of this scheme? Let me tell you how this thought first came to me. It was my privilege for many years while engaged in growing small fruit for market to give employment to quite a number of boys and girls (men and women also) during the harvest season, </seg>
            <seg id="p138">138 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY having had upwards of fifty berry pickers in the field at a time I have known boys, and occasionally some girls, to walk a dist auce of five miles twice a day in order that they might obtain work in the berry fields. True, there was ''the love of money' at the root of this seeking to a great extent, but there was than this. Mothers and fathers of some well to do families have come to me to ask me to take their boy John or George unde my care and teach them to work. Mothers have come with thei children and spent the day in my berry fields because they like&lt; to get out in the country, under nature's skies and among he fruits and flowers. But listen further to this story and you will see how this idea of a summer school for boys came to me. A boy of twelve or thir - ranuMra came to me one morning after his walk of four or five miles and said. "Mr. Williams, I will have to quit." "Why Johnnie! What is the matter?" "Why, my mother want to stay at home and study, so I cau catch up with un - did not pass in my last exam." There was a quiver in Johnnie's and show of tears in h M he told me of this call back to his books. What could I do but advise him to follow his mother's instruction and to try and "catch up" with his &lt; ite my advice I could not help but feel sorry forth* and to wish that his mother could get out in the country an things from the 1 .udpoint. Now you all recognize tliis boy's need, his love for horticultural work and his need to have it gratified. Our horticultural societies through the influence of prominent educators have been trying to solve this problem of Johnnie — what; Sending him out in the country to plant beans, and hoe potatoes and pick strawberries and study nature from her open book; No! but they have gone to work and written a book and sent^Johnnie back to school to study it. Horticulture in our public schools is unquestionably a good thing so far as It can be aptly used; but why not follow the natural order of things and put some of our public school work out in the open fields of hor - ticulture? </seg>
            <seg id="p139">139 OUB SCHOOLS OF HORTICULTURE Our public school system is already burdened by heavy courses and a constant trend to add some new fads each year. Nature study, when crowded into the schoolroom, is of necessity lar artificial; while to study her amid her own surroundings is like reading from her open book. The open field, the forest, the orchard and garden, i* nature's study room. It is here that the lovers of nature seek her i pauionship. The country boys and girls have her ever with t at their homes. It is for the city children that I am pleading. They want these same privileges that their country cousins enjoy. end boys from the farms to the city to get a business educa - tion. Why not reciprocate by sending the city boys to the coun - try '. They are hungry for the opportunity, waiting only for the invitation to come. A business man of Columbus made diligent inquiry of me only recently as to the oppor - tunity for his son to get an agricultural education at college of agriculture. He wanted him to finish his term of school in the city and then send him out to the c try to study farming. His boy had expressed a desire to be&lt; a fanner and the father wanted him to become a scientific one, a cine. He naturally expected that our agricultural school would be the place to send him. I told him that we had iinmer school. "But I want him to learn how to plow and sow and reap,"" said the father, "and you cannot teach him this in the winter time with practice." ••Well."" 1 said. '-You will have to send him to some good farmer through the summer sea - sou and then he can come here for the winter." This is but a sample case of what I believe to be a genuine need for a genuine summer course in agriculture. We have all the equipments nec - essary, simply to extend the curriculum. We have now only a six months' school, and that at the season of the year when real agricultural life is dormant. This is the time, however, for the farmer boys. Now let us give the city boys a chance in the - mer. They want the genuine thing, you know, real horticultural life, not the artificial winter course where we bud willow cuttings and graft rootless tree tops. </seg>
            <seg id="p140">140 NEBRASKA STATE HOTICCLTCEAL SOCIETY The problem of "how to keep the boy on the farm" may be met by this reciprocal course. Upoor trade, you say! Well, perhaps so. The city boy is smart"' for us in some things, but give him a good scientif - ic farm education and see how it will develop him. It is but a fair exchange betwixt the city and country. W trade back and forth in all lines of produce and merchandise wit our city merchants. If they will coax our farm boys into th marts of trade and away from the farm, let us offer equal induce ments on the farm to secure a fair exchange. 1 believe bot parties may profit by the exchange. We must help meet th problem for the purification of the cities, we must ever be closel identified with city life. The arterial blood of the country i needed in our cities and we must expect to receive some venou blood of the city for purification. The country life must be th lungs, the breathing place. Horticulture is a charm of countr life that will draw out the noblest elements of man. Let us mak use of it to purifiy and elevate the congested life of our cities Our state agricultural colleges may do much, and they must d their part, towards meeting the needs of the cities. The citie themselves should by means of the public school system mee this ever increasing need and demand for nature study. 1 would advocate the establishment of rural schools of horti - culture. Locate them in the suburbs of every large city or every county seat and make them a schooling place for the boys and girls during the long summer vacation. If necessary, shorten the terms of the regular course so as to devote a larger period to these nature schools. What shall we do with our boys through the summer vacation is a worrying problem to many a city parent and this would be my suggestion for solving it. These schools of horticulture, or nature schools, if you wish to call them such, must be made practical enough to meet the needs both of the cities and country. The cities, from the boys' point of view, want a recreative school, a restful change from the humdrum studies. In other words, they want a play-spell. The country people, however, </seg>
            <seg id="p141">141 OCR SCHOOLS OF HOBT1CCLTUEI want a training place for workers, a place they can look to for a fresh supply of trained helpers. There is an increasing demand from the country upon the cities for such laborers each year that the cities are failing to meet. Only recently I read of a gardener near the city of Chicago who suffered the loss of twenty acres of late crops because he could not get the help required to harvest them. I know many personal instances of loss in garden and fruit crops because the help needed was not available. A majority of our employers in horticultural operations will not hire boys and girls for their work, and they are constantly com - plaining about the lack of trained help of any age. I have been asked by just such employers, "Why do you hire so many boys? They are not worth their salt." My reply is, "The be the father of the man, and if you want a good man to work must give him a chance to learn while he is a boy." Yen. dear fellow employers, if you want a boy ever to earn his salt you must give him a chance to learn to work, and our workers are the "salt" of this old earth. It is asking too much of the few "missionary"' employers to traiu all the boys who come to t for the benefit of the many who may want their services as i. The schools that I have already discussed mast be made to meet this demand for trained workers. An idle boy is not only a useless piece of humanity but, as the Devil's playfellow, he is sn make himself an object of annoyance and even dread; and i a "holy terror.' 1 Give him a chance in these schools of horticul - ture to grow his own strawberries and grapes, to eat melons and peaches of his own growing, and the chances are, ten to one, that you will not have to sit up at night and watch for his stealthy tread in your garden. Teach him not only the nobility of labor but the sacredness of honest ownership, the golden rule of pro - prietorship, and you will have less use for laws against trespass - ing and for our schools of reform. If in fact the state indus - trial schools, so called, were placed at the county seats of e county, and every idle boy or girl of each county sent the receive employment, then would the remedy for reformatories be brought about. </seg>
            <seg id="p142">142 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY This tlion is the burden of my thought in this paper. Educate the city boys and girls in horticultural ethics and practice. Educate them to look upon the "man with the hoe" not as a drudge but as one of the most essential factors to our noble American manhood. SMALL FRUITS BY T. H. 1'BRRY, ELK CKEKK When the statement is made that everyone should have fresh fruits each in its season and besides in sufficient quantities to be prepared for times of dirth, there is a ready acquiescence from all quarters. The physician will recommend its use in its varied forms, both in sickness and in health. The system demands its regular use in order to effectively meet the demands of life. Nothing else has been discovered that will form a suitable substitute for the use of well ripened, well prepared fruit in the economy of the household. There is not likely to be any infringement upon the domain ac - quired almost universally in the homes of the land by fruit as a staple article of diet, by any chemical or dietical discovery. In other words, fruit whatever it may have been in the past has become a prime necessity whenever procurable. And as "var - iety is the spice of life" if there were no other reason the so-called small fruits must have a place among the kinds grown. In fact there are so many varied uses to which they may be put, so many voids in the cuisine department of the home without them, that might be called with better appreciation of their worth. THE LARGE FRUITS t Recognizing, however, that the major portion of such fruits •e not well adapted to long shipment nor to delay in using hen once ripened, and it will become apparent at once that the supply for any given district must be grown in or near that district else the consumer must depend solely upon the canned and dried product, of which the least said in comparison with </seg>
            <seg id="p143">143 SMALL FBUITS the freshly picked and home canned of preserved frnit the In Or differently put, each should strive to grow enough at least for himself, for failing to do so, he must use an iudifft article unless someone nearby is growing for market. Now! if successful demonstration proves anything at all it is well established that nearly if not all small fruits can he grown in our own state. There is too much really fine fruit and too many successful growers to allow any doubt as to the fa&lt; Yet those same successful ones are too seldom in evidence and the fellow who "can't raise any berries anyway" and tin who will tell you "it don't pay nohow," are too often ones to demand attention. The first one may be from Missouri and must be shown, while of the last except for the sake of his family the least said the better. If yon please then we will consider the case of the man who has failed to accomplish what he has honestly striven for viz. to raise small fruits. Doubtless there is not a successful grower in the state who might not at some time have been classed here. Because, while we boast of advancement and kuowledge along horticultural lines, as yet, we are only sappers and miners pre - paring the way of those who are to follow, knowing that, where - as the route before us has been trying and hazardous, the road has been blazed and in part, well corduroyed with blasted hopes, for those following. If only they will look to the pitfalls and quagmires of the way, success is bound to come in greater meas - ure to them than to us, and with less effort. Granted then! that some things have been learned about grow - ing small fruits in Nebraska, let us notice for a moment how our man from Missouri is to get righted. First: there are in every locality parties who have the goods to show fortheir faith and labor. Follow their lead, but not blindly, as to location, varieties and culture. Not blindly for soils vary even on the same farm and different treatment will be required. Varieties, noticeably of the strawberry, are exceedingly fickle as to surroundings and must be catered to largely. And yet </seg>
            <seg id="p144">144 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY • there is danger and more stumbling at the other extreme, that is, of getting something new, therefore, wholly untried, at a fancy price to beat our successful grower at his own game. The result being blasted hopes and blasting words aimed at the agent who sold and all infernal idiots who have ever advocated planting fruits in Nebraska. Second: Our man should be over careful not to repose too much confidence in descriptions of varieties from catalogues and newspapers. They are too often inspired by the desire to push the sale of plants rather than pave the way to successful fruit growing. Do not misunderstand me, I would not discourage the trial of new varieties wholly, but would induce, if possible, the novice to leave this share of the business severely alone till such a time as he has demonstrated his ability to grow that which is known to be good and reliable. Here perhaps more than in any other way nursery men and plant growers have stood in their own light viz. by praising a novelty extravagantly for the sake of the few extra cents that may be gotten from its sale above the standard variety, knowing at the same time nine hundred and ninety out of every one thousand such novelties will prove of no value in the hand of the amateur grower. Last and largest of the elements of success rest with the man himself, for no matter how well his plot for a fruit garden has been chosen and prepared, how wisely varieties have been select - ed and planted only failure or a modicum of success will follow unless he is ready at all tinr.es to drop other work, that appar - ently must needs be done, and look after his fruit. Any one having a few rods of Nebraska's productive soil at his disposal, . may have plenty of sound, wholesome, luscious, invigorating and health giving fruit for his table at all seasons with something above the ordinary for company. If he will follow the plan outlined. Now will it or does it pay to grow small fruits? Would that this question might be omitted from the discussion but it would be un-American. </seg>
            <seg id="p145">145 DISCLS8ION Yes! it pays and that handsomely to the extent that the fruit an be used at home. The pay in dollars and cents may not be obvious to all, but if lessened grocers' and fruiters' bills be ounted to say nothing of the growing infrequency of the doctors' visits aside from the buoyancy and uplifting of spirits vouch - afed every member of the family over the ever new succt - of ripening fruits which might be pharaphrased from our loved 'harles Dudley Warner's words by saying, "These are different ronj other fruits, because they grew for us." So much for small fruit growing for the family. Will it pay commercially? Yes! No! Yes! if near good towns or in localities where the farmer and suburbanite are too engrossed with other modes of money getting or too tied to the tradition that the highest priced is the best iu plants to follow the suggestions contained above. No! if opposite conditions obtained and more particularly no! if because, a good return has been had, say from one acre. Fifty times as much is expected from fifty acres. DISCUSSION Chairman Christy — We have another successful berry grower, of Weeping Water . He can give us an idea as to whether or not it pays. Dr. Hungate has a paper in this book here, last years report. De. Hungate — As to whether or not these papers are print - ed in the reports as read, I assure you they are. Last year I had the temerity to leave my medicine case and operate in this line, of putting on the typewriter my experience with strawberry plants and go down there and read it. I do not know as it pays in the sense of dollars and cents, There are different ways of looking at it in the long run as to whether or not it pays in the way of human happiness. I want you to read what'I said. I find it here printed word for word as I put it on the typewriter, the questions asked me in the discuss - ion — everything is down here.

We have an area of 76,840 square miles, comprising 121,000 farms, rep - resenting a total valuation of $748,000,000. During the past half century the wealth of the state has made the phenominal annual gain of over 2500 per cent. Starting from nothing fifty years ago today we rank third among the states of the union in the production of corn, fourth in the production of wheat, and fourth in the production of cattle. Our people are brave, pro - gressive, peaceable and law-abiding. Nebraska enjoys the pecu - liar distinction of having the least illiteracy of any state in the union. We have run well the race with our sister states for supremacy in agricultural pursuits. The icrying need of Ne - braska today is for men, men of character, men of brains. We want to attract men of the same stock as our fathers who have converted these vast wild prairies into comfortable and happy homes. We must attract a class of immigrants that will add dig - nity and character to our state. The only valid excuse we can offer for making an exhibit at St. Louis is to advertise our splendid accomplishments in a way that will draw to us a desirable class of immigrants. How can we better subserve that purpose than by making a neat tasty exhibition of our fruit products? No greater inducement can be held out to a home builder than a location where plenty of good wholesome fruit may be found close at hand. The failure of the pioneer orchardists led many to believe tha fruit could not be grown in Nebraska. Almost without excep tion the first orchards planted in the state were a failure. Th earliest pioneers came largely from the Eastern States. Natura ly they began planting apple trees that did well in the commun ities from whence they came. The Spitzenburg, New Town Pippin, Rhode Island Greening, and such varieties were thos mostly planted. Of course these are all good apples but they are not acclimated to the west. It is easy for us now to under- </seg>

While these sturdy frontiersmen were sinking their thousands of dollar - planting orchards that never bore apples, they were passing through a formative and an experimental period the fruit of which will place millions of dollars into the pockets of their off - spring. But for the untiring energy the dogged perseverance, and the unswerving sticktuitiveness of such men as Robert W. Furnas, J. Sterling Morton, and others I might mention, who have done equally as much for the advancement of Horticulture, Nebraska could not claim the prestige she enjoys today. Almost within the past decade it has been claimed that peaches, pears and other soft fruit could not be successfully grown in the state. Thanks to the enterprise or our progressive horticulturists, we can now successfully refute all these assertions. We can produce just as good apples, pears, peaches, plumbs, cherries and grapes as can be grown in any state in the union. It has also been demonstrated that the fruit belt is not confined to the eastern counties. Excepting in the sand hill area, I am told that under proper treatment fruit can be successfully grown almost to the western bounds of the state. The possibilities of Nebraska as a producer of fruit are almost without limit. Situated as we are in the centre of the continent with nearly all the great trunk rail - ways that connect the Atlantic with the Pacific traversing state, we are especially well located for commercial fruit grow - ing. We also have direct communication with the markets of the great Northwest and extreme South. Both of these districts are practically barren of fruit especially apples. Nebraska will always rank among the first states as a producer of corn, pork and beef. So far as I can see, there is no valid reason why she should not rank first in the production of apples and the soft fruits. While we are advertising to our sister states and to the world the great possibilities of our state as a producer of fine fruit at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, we will at the same time start our own people to thinking along these lines. In my judgment, if our progressive Nurserymen wish to do some effective adver- </seg>
            <seg id="p154">154 NEBRASKA 8TATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY tising, they can not do so in a more telling way than to send some of their best specimens of fruit to the exposition. Thou - sands of people from Nebraska will visit the exposition next summer, that will doubtless for the first time realize that just as good fruit can be raised here as in any other state. Geutlemen if we make such an exhibit of fruit at St. Louis as the importance of the industry demands the progressive patriotic horticulturists of the state must put their shoulder to the wheel and help to make it^uch. The amount of money placed in the hands of our state commission is a mere bagatelle, and the sum set aside for the horticulture is necessarily small. Consequently I expect to look to you gentlemen for loyal support. I view this enterprise in the same light as the public spirited men of a town look upon a location of a great factory in their midst. Location and natural advantages have not had half as much to do with making Chicago, Kansas City and Omaha great commercial centres as the patriotic public spirited men who have given their time, their brains and their money in forging the interests of these cities to the front on every occasion. Likewise if Nebraska acquires the prestige and the importance among the horticulture states that her natural resources and location warrant, it will be due to the efforts of her unselfish, enterprising citizens. I wish to appeal to you individually to give me your earnest support in this matter. If any of you have a large quantity or even a few specimens of extra fancy fruit of any kind, at once place yourselves in communication with me or carefully pack the same in a stout package and express it to me at St. Louis. I will bear all the expense incident to transporation and pay you for the fruit if you send me a bill for it. It is not a ques - tion of how much you or I can get out of the enterprise, but how much time, fruit or money, if need be, we are willing to give to advance the interests of horticulture in our beloved state. Who are the men in the state yea in this society who have reared monuments unto themselves for great services to the public? Are they men that have received great pecuniary gifts from the state? By no means, no. Such men as Morton, </seg>

LOCIS EXPOSITION Furuas, Stephens, Masters, Russell, Williams and others that I might mention will hand their names down to coming ages as great public benefactors. Their fame has come through years of loyal unselfish devotion to the upbuilding and uplifting of this grand and glorious state. Most of these old veterans have lived to see their cherished plans carried to a succesful termination. The praises and plaudits of an appreciative admiring public is worth more to them and has brought to them more genuint isfaction and joy than the acquiring of millions in gold. Let those of us who are the offspring of these noble sires carry forward this work so handsomely begun. Let us put our shoulders to the wheel of progress and carry proud Nebraska not to the fourth, third or second place but to the first rank among all the fruit producing states in the union. If any of you should have anything out of the ordinary along the line of fruit, peaches, pears, plums, or are interested in the propagation of any particular variety, if you want to do a little advertising for yourselves, we would be glad to have you send it. The idea I had in mind is this if 3 ou can take a sample of that kind if you will express it to St. Louis it will not only be a great thing for you individually as an advertisement introducing the new variety, but it will be one of the best advertisements of the state. So, I hope that no matter what line you may be interested in, if you have anything that is out of the ordinary if I don't happen to write to you I want you to write to me, and I will be glad to take the matter up witii you and look after it, and I will pay the expense of transportation. DISCUSSION. If anyone has any questions to ask me I will be glad toau - the best I can. Q. — What is the amount the state set aside for the Horticultur - al Society; A. — Five thousand dollars. Q. — What kind of a basket would you recommend for ship ping- </seg>
            <seg id="p156">156 A. — The Burlington Basket Company advertises a basket for frnit, the exhibition of fruit. I think that is the best adapted for small fruit. There will be a fruit exhibit there. I hare not been able to find out definitely in regard to it, but I wrote Mr. Taylor a short time ago for information and he wrote that nothing definitely had been decided upon yet. However, it is known that there will be a pomological for competition of fruit. I would like to en courage horticulture along that line. Get up your exhibits am send them to me, and I will look after them personally and see that they are put in the right class and arranged in the prope manner. A Member — I think if we get four or five men to ride over our respective counties, or other counties, I think we could get twice the number of varieties that we would otherwise get as in - dividuals. Me. Baknari* — It is my experience that we must have some one of experience to pack the fruit, or it will not be fit to exhibit. Me. Marshall — It seems to me you are likely, too, to have feast or famine. I do not think we should depend upon random shipments. One week with plentv and next week with none This business most be organized. You must notify the peopl that such and such days are shipping days, or, a shipment come on a certain day and another shipment comes on another da\ We are close to it, and we can get right out after it and bring in. I thought we were organized, but we are not. It is best t be well organized and not over look one thing. For instance you will start out with cherries from Richardson county, and the from other counties north and west. Then, the early apple an&lt; the same routine in regard to shipments should be followed. Mr. Pollard — I am fearful lest there shall be a wrong dis - cussion on my remarks. I do not want the members of this society to get the idea that I am going to depend upon that method. I wish to assure you that we will have the machinery </seg>
            <seg id="p157">157 FOREIGN BOTANICAL GARDENS AND PAKK8 organized and in good operation. I am sure you will bring us all the fruit we need. I simply threw out this other idea if you had something out of the ordinary we want to get in touch with you and help you and look after it for you. Everyone who sends fruit for exhibition should have his name and address on the card with the name of the fruit and variety. In that way you will be advertising yourselves. And no fruit man will be able to place any inferior fruit on exhibition. I might say, in a general way, for the benefit of any who might not know how to ship fruit, pack apples, that we adapted this plan, the apple was to be rolled up in tissue paper after taking it off the tree carefully so not to have any blemishes on it, nor no bruises. SOME FOREIGN BOTANICAL GARDENS AND PARKS.* BY PROFESSOR CHARLES E. BESSET. Last summer I had the privilege of visiting a number of botan ical gardens and parks in different parts of Europe. The Amer can visitor abroad is constantly reminded of the abundance o parks and botanical gardens in not only the large cities but i in the small cities and towns. In London, Hyde Park is a grea tract of land, at least a mile and a half in length and from one half to three-quarters of a mile in width, situated in the heart o the city. It contains in the neighborhood of 600 acres. Som portions of it are heavily covered with trees and shrubs, other are sparsely covered with trees, and still other portions again con sist of greensward without shrubs or trees. Here and there are often beds and masses of ornamental flowering plants. Walk and drives are provided at frequent intervals. In some place the people are kept from walking upon the grass, while in othe places they are permitted to use the ground very freely. I saw boys and girls of all ages playing as freely in this park as the •From the stenographic notes of an oral address. </seg>
            <seg id="p158">158 Fi the fields and public places in this country. far from park is a smaller one, Regent's Park, nearly circular in shape containing about thirty acres. This is considerably more orna - mental and apparently the public cannot use the ground as freel as in Hyde Park. St. James's Park and Green Park are tw much smaller parks together aggregating perhaps one hundre( These are not far from Buckingham Palace, the residenc of the king, and are situated in a very densely settled portion o the city. Here the children of all ages gambol about on the ground with - out any fear whatever from the police. In fact it seems that to a very large extent these London parks are for the benefit of the pie. When we consider that there are here in the heart of Londo nearly or perhaps quite 1000 acres of land set apart for park pu poses we may realize how fully the people of that great city l&gt;t lieve in open places for the benefit of the women and childre and the tired men. These parks if cut up into lots and sol would bring almost fabulous amounts of money. How it has ha] pened that the real estate agent has been kept from laying h grimy hands upon these open places is more than I can tel These parks if sold for building purposes would yield hundret of millions of dollars, and yet the sturdy Englishmen would re sent most fiercely any attempt to restrict or reduce their area. 'W add to these parks in the heart of the city the many parks n the suburbs, Richmond Park, Wimbledon, Kew. Chiswick. etc.. etc., aggregating perhaps 2500 to 8000 acres, and we have some idea of what the great English city has done for its people. But this is not all. In the suburb called Kew are the Royal Botanical Gardens, known the world over as the Kew Gardens. Here on an area as large as a Nebraska farm are gathered all of the plants which can be made to grow under the care of the most skillful gardeners to be found in the kingdom. Here in the great Arboretum one may walk through a forest which if not primeval is as dense and wild as the primeval forest itself. Here one may find trees brought from America, from distant parts of Europe, </seg>
            <seg id="p159">159 FOREIGN BOTANICAL GARDENS AND PARKS from Asia, from India, and from Africa. Here are grown in profusion shrubs of all kinds from all climates, and here under glass where the temperature and the moisture conditions are made to imitate as closely as possible the different climates, may be found tens of thousands of species of trees and shrubs and herbaceous plants, all labelled and named so that "he who runs may read."" Here daily thousands of people walk through the great grounds finding at once recreation and instruction. Who can measure the value of these great gardens to the people who live in London itself. And now add to this the fact that from all parts of the world scientific men come to study the collection of plants which are brought together in the Kew Gardens. It is the Mecca of botan - he world over, and to this place sooner or latter every sys - tematic botanist must come in order to study the great treasures which for a century or two have been gathering in this place. In Berlin, the capital of Germany, an area of probably acres is set aside under the name of the "Thiergarten,"' and here again as in London the people swarm day and night, walking through the paths under the shade of the great trees, lingering by the beautiful shrubbery and admiring the great beds of fine flow - ering plants. Here are found at intervals, monuments, sta and other architectual structures which commemorate the great deeds of the German people, — a tribute to the feeling of patrio which is so prominent in the Fatherland. A mile away are the old botanical gardens, still in the densely built up portion of the city. Thirty or forty acres of ground are set apart here for trees and shrubs and plant-houses. Here I saw the greatest collection of cactuses to be found any place in the world. Although the cactuses are American plants it is true that if one wishes to study thoroughly these plants of America one can do so best by goiug to Berlin and making use of this uurivalled collection of living, growing plants. But this old garden has proved to be entirely too small and within the last few years at the little suburb of Dahlem on the southwest edge of the city the government has set apart about 150 </seg>
            <seg id="p160">160 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY acres of land, and here a new botanical garden has been install - ed. Here one may even now find plants of all kinds from all countries and all climates. Here the government has erected fine office and laboratory buildings, and at the time of my visit the great plant houses were just being enclosed. When the work is completed this will rival the Royal Gardens at Kew. In Vienna, although the city is an ancient one, those i authority have seen to it that there are great areas left vacant fo breathing places for the public. One afternoon I visited th great Prater Park on the edge of the city, three miles long am from one-third to a half a mile in width. Here are from 600 t acres of land, some of it open forming meadows on whic the children play, some of it in very dense forests, some of covered with shrubs. Some portions of it have been treated ver arefully with the best development of landscape effects, whi] others have been allowed to remain in as nearly as possible natural state. I saw at least 50,000 people at the time of m visit and as I looked over the great crowds that had flocked her or recreation and rest, I questioned whether the number was no louble this. What a park of this kind means to the great city lave not time here to discuss. It means at least life and healt and enjoyment for tens of thou8ands,yes,hundreds of thousands,o women and children and tired men. Away across Central Europe into the land of the Czar is tl old city of Moscow, the old capital city of all the Russians. Her I found a botanical garden belonging to the Agricultural Inst tute which rivals anything to be found in America. The garde includes not only a great Arboretum in which trees from all part of the temperate portion of the world are grown, but in additio the garden, proper, where plots of herbaceous plants repre senting many of the botanical groups, are planted i and careful] studied. In connection with this garden is a large farm wit fine buildings and modern improvements. Both garden an&lt; farm seem to be maintained for the purpose of instructing th people. Visitors are welcome here and the object lesson whic </seg>
            <seg id="p161">161 SOME FOREIGN BOTANICAL GARDENS AND PARKS is before them cannot fail to be very beneficial to the farmers and the gardeners of this portion of Russia. Now go south across the great Steppes to the northern slopes of the Caucasus mountains. We leave the great cities of Europe and find ourselves in the region where there are only small cities, and towns of moderate size. We stop at Kislovodsk in the foot - hills on the northerly slopes of the mountains. Here is a town of about 6000 inhabitants. It lies along the banks of the Kuiua river which flows down from the snowy summits of the moun - tains. Yet in this little city there is a fine old park, not situated as we might suppose, on the outskirts where the land is cheap, but in the very heart of the city. Here are perhaps 100 acre* of land covered with tree* most of which have been planted, and filled with paths and booths, public halls and play grounds, and running through it is the roaring stream which adds geatly to the charm of the place. Here every night one may listen to the music furnished by one of the military bands. It is a cool, peaceful, restful place, and as one thinks that all this is in a little town in an out of the way corner of the world, he cannot help wishing that his own people in this enlightened land esteemed things as highly as do these people. At Vladikavkaz, a city a little smaller than Lincoln, lying at the north end of the great military road which crosses the moun - tains through Dariel Pass, I found a city lying on a level plain. The city was founded by one of the former rulers of Russia for the purpose of guarding this pass, and yet here I found that the principal street was in the form of a delightful avenue. Down the center of the street had been planted a double row of I and between these an elevated walk had been built. This walk is perhaps two feet above the level of street on each side, and is twenty or twenty-five feet in width. On a hot day one may imagine how pleasant it is to walk down this avenue under the shade of the overhanging trees, and as the evening coolness conn - this becomes still more attractive. At frequent intervals comfort - able seats have been provided, and here the tired people i out and rest for an hour or two every evening. Here the chil- </seg>
            <seg id="p162">162 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Pren play, running back and forth as children will. But this is ot all. At the side of the same avenue are the city gardens ling from 50 to 60 or 70 acres. One enters these gardens as he would the private grounds of some wealthy owner in thi country, but after entering he finds himself in a shady park The portion of the park nearest the street has been set aside fo the children, and here are provided many games, swings am similar things for their enjoyment. This portion of the garden s always full of the voices and the chatter of happy children ""urther on are statutes, and ponds, and fountains, and here from ime to time there is music and other means for enjoyment an&lt; recreation. Remember that this is in a far away Russian cit which was built not for beauty but through military necessity lere, if any place in the world, such things as parks and gar ens might well be forgotton, but here we found parks and gar lens which are more attractive than any that I know of in a cit of equal size in this country. Now cross the great mountain range imto the dry and parch - ed country of Transcaucasia, to the banks of the Kura River, and the city of Tiflis. The rainfall here is not to exceed 20 inches ar and the soil is for the most part very sandy, and yet in this city of about the size of Omaha are found large parks for the benefit of the people. Alexander Park covering perha; - lies in the heart of the city. All around it is the bustling, hurrying crowd of men and woman engaged in trade, and inside of the park are trees, flowers, fountains, pools, statuary. Here are grounds on which children may play. Here every night one may hear good music. Here are seats for tired people, here in fact are all the things that contribute to the enjoyment of people day and night. On the north side of the city a new park has been recently laid out for the benefit of the inhabitants of that portion of the town. In connection with the new park are gar - for the acclimatization of plants and for other economic purposes. I know of nothing like this in any city in this coun - try excepting New York and St. Louis. At the south end of the city are the botanical gardens of </seg>
            <seg id="p163">163 8OME FOREIGN BOTANICAL i&gt; 1'AKKS • Tiflis. Here are gathered trees and shrubs and flowers as well as rare plants, including palms and ferns and bamboos. While open to the public under certain restrictions, this is not intended as a public park in the ordinary et those who enter the grounds find here all kinds of plants label that those who visit may receive instruction. I to fifteen thousand different i if plants are grown out of do«&gt;! these interesting grounds. Theu there are plant hoi libraries, and collections of preserved botanical material. I was very much surprised at the magnitude of the work which was under way in this botanical garden, and yet it must be re - membered that this is all in connection with a city no larger than our own metropolis of Omaha. Still further south LOO miles or more, on the plains of South - ern Amenia, under the shadow ■ \rarat, is the little city of Erivan containing about It lies on the hot and dusty plains in the immediate vicinity of the great mountain. The rainfall is probably not to exceed 10 inc: ir. On the of the city runs the river Zenga which flows from a mountain lake. Lake Gokschai, many miles northeastward. Nothing will grow here except under irrigation. The land is a dry and parch - ed one: and yet in this city of Armenians, Turks, (irnsians, and other non-European types, we found in the center of th&lt; portion, a park of considerable dimensions. It is true that it was not as beautiful a park as many that w 1, but a parkin a region of but ten inches of rainfall cannot rival the parks in Lon - don; yet hen- was valuable land set aside for this purpose. Around the park were gathered the hotels and the largei houses. Through the park there ran the irrigating ditches and here were provided walks and seats in abundance, and at night electric lights and music, and here the people at the end of the hot days gathered to talk, to chat, to walk up and down, and to listen to the music. At Batum; a city of 30,000 people lying at the • ! of the Black Sea, and until twenty-five years ago a Turkish cit\ found another park which might well be envied by any American </seg>
            <seg id="p164">164 NEBBA8KA STATE HOETICCLTUKAL 8OCIETY city of equal size. Although so recently wrested from the Tur] the city has made much progress in the development of its park We found one portion to include many trees which we had no yet seen, and these trees are not confined to the region alone We found many American trees growing luxuriantly in the park showing that the managers were men of education and broa&lt; training, and here too we found to our delight a botanical garde with hundreds of trees both native and foreign all named in sue a plain way that the ordinary visitor might gain much valuab information in regard to them. Again we found walks, and pool and statues, and seats, all contributing to the comfort and enjo i ment of the many visitors. Crossing the Black Sea from the east end to the west end, we reached the great mercantile city of Odessa with its half million people. Here one might well excuse the people for not giving attention to things like parks and botanical gardens, for this is the great mercantile city of Russia, and it lies on a sandy, gravelly shore of the sea, and is watered by but very little annual rainfall, and yet along the sea front is a fine boulevard with walks and play-grounds and here the children and the tired mothers gather day and night. A short distance away, and connected with it, is Alexander Park of about 100 acres with a dense growth of forest trees and under-shrubs, and here again as before seats and other conveniences are abundantly provided. One cannot go through these foreign parks without having it impressed upon him that the purpose of the park is to provide resting places and play-grounds for the tired people, while at the same time adding the element of beauty. Further down the coast in the suburbs of the city we found a row of parks, and here to our delight we found also a botanical garden where the government under the directiou of the University is introducing large numbers of foreign plants, and labelling them so that those who visit the grounds may be instructed as well as amused. I need go no further in my illustrations. What I have said of the parks of these cities has been to simply bring the matter be - fore you in order to emphasize the fact that in the cities abroad </seg>
            <seg id="p165">165 SOME FOREIGN BOTANICAL GARDENS AND PARKS the making of parks and gardens is looked upon as one of the necessary things in every city. In America we ought to imitate this good habit. It is true that in this country our largest c have parks, but to a very great extent they are situated in the suburbs alone, and the very people who should have the opportn - nity of getting to them never reach them,and our smaller cities generally have no parks at all, and when we come to our towns and villages what can we say? There are no places for the children and the women and the tired people generally. Coming now to our own city of Lincoln, a city which has many things about it which are very attractive, one is made to drop his head in shame that we have no parks. It is true that four blocks of land, between D and F and Sixth and Eighth streets were originally set apart and labelled "City Park," but this is scarce - ly more than a "common," for here cattle and horses and swine are permitted to roam at large. For years this has been a reproach to the city. All that is good in it we owe to the private efforts of the public spirited women of the city, and yet year by year their efforts have been largely negatived by the utter lack of pub - lic spirit shown by our officials. This little tract of land was not fitted by nature for park purposes, and yet it has been made less useful by its absolute neglect. We must preach a reformation. Is it not to our credit that this city has no breathing place iu it. We must have not one, alone, but several public grounds where children may play, where people may gather, where they may sit and rest in the cool of the evenings of the hot days of summer. Why can we not set aside in the Antelope Valley a tract of land on which we may erect a proper Lincoln Park worthy of our city? Such a park would be central, such a park could be visited by the great majority of the people of the city. It is not worth our while to consider matters of this kind* Finally, is it to much to hope that within a short time the Uni - versity may establish a botanical garden where may be gathered all of the native plants of the state, all of the plants which may be made to grow in this region, where every plant grown shall </seg>
            <seg id="p166">166 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL 8OCIETY be labelled so that the visitor as he passes through the garden may learn not only the name but the history of the plant as well. 8uch a garden may be a place of beauty and of interest and at the same time it may have a high educational value for all the people of the state. Whereupon this meeting adjourned till 9 o'clock a. m. Thurs - day, January 21, 1904. President Christy rapped the convention to order and said that Dr. Bessey desired to introduce a resolution. Dr. Bessey — I have a resolution which I desire to introduce at the proper time. I don't wish this Society to feel that I am always introducing resolutions, but this is near enough the first of the year to bring this in as a "resolution" to be adopted for our good. President Christy — This is a good time of the year to make resolutions. Prof. Bessey — I wish to introduce the following resolution. RESOLUTIONS. Whereas, the Calaveras Grove of Big Trees in California now owned by private parties is in danger of destruction through lumbering operations, and Whereas, such destruction would be a great loss to the world of science as well as to all men and women who have regard for the wonders of Nature, and Whereas, bills have been introduced in the United States Senate and House of Representatives looking to the establish - ment of a reservation which shall include this grove, and thus preserve it forever as a National Park ; therefore, be it Ii&gt; so/red, That the Nebraska State Horticultural Society here by expresses its hearty sanction of this movement, and requests our Senators and Representatives to use every honorable means to secure the early enactment of a law which shall preserve these great trees from destruction; THURSDAY, JANUARY SI, 1904. </seg>

Prof. Bessey — If the president please, 1 move the adoption of the resolution. Same was seconded and adopted. Mr. Harrison — Almost all of our Parks are inaccessible, and the question of visiting them is almost impossible on account of the distance. There is a magnificent tract in eastern Colorado in Pueblo and Custer counties with as fine scenery as there the world. It would cost about §20 to visit this park, while it would take about $12U to visit the Yellowstone Park. I move you, Mr. President, that in this resolution we also em - body the request that this new park be thrown open to the public. It is the nearest great park to Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa and Mis - souri that we have. The motion was seconded and adopted. Mr. Davidson — In behalf of the citizens of Aurora I extend to this Society an invitation to hold their semi-annual or summer meeting in Aurora. We have secured the use of our fine court house and I will guarantee that we will make that as plea place as you could find anywhere, and see that you all are well taken care of during your stay there.

Mr. President, Fellow * and Visitor* — The subject o my paper. "Horticulture at the World's Fair" as alloted to me b} the Secretary, Mr. L. M. Russell, would have been more appro priately entitled "Floriculture at the World's Fair," as Floricul tare is my particular field in the apportionment of the work of the Department of Horticulture. However, as the term agricul ture embraces many subjects and as one of these subjects, Horti culture, has many subdivisions I feel that I have no excu offer if I neglect to mention one of these subdivisions, namely Pomology, which is the special field of that eminent pomologist Mr. John T. Stinson, who is identified with the Exposition in th capacity of Superintendent of Pomology. In the early stages of horticultural work at the Exposition Mr. Frederic W. Taylor, Chief of the Department of Horticulture as well as Agriculture, suggested to the Exposition management that he be given jurisdiction over the natural eminence upon which both Agriculture and Horticulture buildings stand and which is known as ''Agriculture Hill." Mr. Taylor desired the use of this tract in order that he might beautify it with the choi - cest exhibits of the most successful florists and nurserymen of America and Europe. This tract emprises 73 acres. The build - ings cover 26 acres, leaving 47 acres to be covered with exhibits each exhibit being so placed in the general treatment as to pre - sent a beautiful and harmonious picture when completed. Work was commenced on this tract by the Department of Horticulture in the latter part of April, 1903. Nothing but yellow clay banks and hills presented themselves and to subdue these and bring them into condition for planting enlisted the best efforts of the Depart - ment. This was up-hill work, for engineers, contractors, graders and others were at work there, each pushing his own work so as to make a good showing and the results of this striving to excel each other is apparent at the present time, in the condition of </seg>

Paul Neyron planted Ma\ made a growth of 4 feet 3 inches, blossom shoots. Shrubbery was planted as late as June 12 and all have made a remarkable growth. The first bed of roses was planted when huge steam grading machines were working around the bed and the next bed was planted a quarter of a mile away. This is only one of the many difficulties which had to be bridged over when getting started on the work. Today every inch of ground has been covered with from 3 to 16 inches of good black loam and lawns of mossy grass have appeared in place of the clay banks and mounds. East of the Agricultural building is located the Rose Section. Exhibits in this section, which is 6 acres in extent, have been contributed by nurserymen and florists. Adjoining this on the north and north-east of Agriculture building is a netioi voted to conifer exhibits. Directly in front of the northern en - trance to the Agriculture building is located the famous Floral Clock. The dial of this clock is 100 feet in diameter and the dial as well as the hands of the clock will be planted in flowering and foliage plants. The minute hand is 50 feet long. This inni chronometer will keep absolutely accurate time, the minute hand moving »5 feet every minute. The mechanical workings of this clock will be revealed by doors in the tower opening at each hour. It will strike the hours and half hours. Electricity will make it possible to read the hour on this floral feature after dark by reason of the S,000 lights arranged on the dial. On the west side of the Agriculture building, north of the center, will be the massive beds of ('annas, Gladiolus. Caladium and Dahlias covering from 400 sq. feet to half an m South of the center and on the west side of the Agriculture building, the Wild Flower Section, comprising -1 acres, will be located. These wild flowers will vary from Nympheas to Opun - tias. Full flowering perennials will be prominent in this plant- </seg>

This idea is the conception of Mr. Frederic W. Taylor, Chief of the Department of Horticulture. 1 Returning to the rose gardens we will pursue our course south, djacent to these sections on the south are collections of shrub- B&gt;ry and specimen lawn trees. South of these and north east of e Conservatory are located the Aquatic Sections. The larger quatic Section is one acre in area, in which 5000 water plants will be used, mostly Nympheas. The space between Agriculture and Horticulture buildings will &gt;e given to formal treatment. Flower beds, vases and statuary will embellish this part of "Agriculture Hill." On the terrace north of Horticulture will be placed the foreign exhibits. A ter - race 500 feet long with promenade along its entire length will be reated in the formal style of landscape gardeniug. The space south of Horticulture building and connecting with Live Stock will be treated naturally. In the treatment of the general outdoor planting there will be I prevailing tone which the observant horticulturist will not fail detect. This characteristic will be the use of what might prop - ly be termed American Gardening in contradistinction to the alian system. The American system consists in utilizing all e natural and wild flowers in beatifying a given spot, while the alian system brings into use, too strongly it is thought, pergo - , terraces, statuary, etc. The American system stands for of use natural floriculture; the Italian system appeals to the ap - eciation with the aid of artistry of a different kind, foreign to e subject. It is the opinion of some American gardners that y attempt to compare the product of nature with the efforts of an's art, only results in distraction and should not be tolerated the artistic arrangement of flora. So much for the outside space and outside exhibits Horticulture building is divided into three sections. The main section or Fruit Room will be devoted to Pomology. The Con- </seg>

The space to be devoted to the pomological exhibits at Louisiana Purchase Exposition is more than twice as large as has ever been devoted to fresh fruit exhibits at any national or inter - national exposition. This space is located in the main room of the Horticulture building and covers an area of four acr The entire area of this large room is all good exhibit space owing to the arrangement of the aisles. There are no main aisles running directly through the building but instead, the a radiate from the center in all directions witli the main ais!&lt; tending practically all around the exhibit space. This arrange - ment distributes the visitors over the entire area. In the central part of this room, covering a space of 4". square feet, none but low installation will be permitted, thus en - abling the visitor to see practically all the exhibits in the entire area from any one point within this low installation section. On the space surrounding this area high installation will be permitted and the states securing allotments here will erect such installation as will best suit their requirements. The efforts that </seg>
            <seg id="p172">172 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY have been put forth in the Department of Horticulture to have an extensive and comprehensive exhibit of cold storage fruits on ex - hibit at the opening of the Exposition have met with favor from the commissioners in the different states and as a result a large amount of fruit is in cold storage in St. Louis and elsewhere. It is expected that the entire four acres of exhibit space will be cov - ered with complete fruit exhibits on the opening day of the Expo - sition. This will necessarily be an apple exhibit as far as a ma - jority of the states are concerned and it will give a splendid op - portunity for those interested in studying the effects of cold storage of fruits to secure information. The behaviorof the same varieties, grown in far distant locations and under different con - ditions will be interesting. In addition to the state exhibits, a collective exhibit of fruits will be maintained by the Department of Horticulture. In this collective exhibit specimens of the same varieties from all sections will be exhibited thus affording a splendid opportunity to study the effect of climate on varieties. Horticulturists will naturally be interested in this exhibit as it will enable them to make a careful study of this subject in the least possible time. The exhibit of horticultural machinery and appliances at this Exposition will be made as extensive as possible. It is the de - sire of the Chief of the department to have on exhibition every machine and appliance that the fruit growers use. The exhibit of spraying appliances, both liquid and dust machines, will be extensive. Orchard machinery of all kinds, cultivators, pruning apparatus, etc. will be shown prominently. The exhibits of car - riers or packages for fruit and vegetables, such as boxes, craves, etc. for fruit will cover a wide range and be an opportunity for close study by commercial orchard ists and fruit raisers and shippers. The educational value of an exhibit of this kind appeals to fruit growers and the exceptional advantage it offers to secure in - formation will be appreciated by those engaged in the work. The attention of the pomologist will also be directed to the ex - hibits of pears, quinces, cherries, plums, peaches, apricots, nee- </seg>

Taylor, Chief of the Department of Horticul - ture. I shall not say anything in introduction. If there is any - one here who does not know the frank, kindly, and energetic Chief of the Horticulture Department of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, that one is not familiar with horticultural conditions in Nebraska or the United States. His exposition experience is not only interstate but international. Exposition work is his diversion. It is no more difficult for him to conjure up infinitely beautiful and original floral effects out of clay mounds than it would be for me to plant a rose bush. Nothing is done on the spur of the moment. Everything is planned months before actual operations become necessary. A tribute to Mr. Taylor's ability and efficient management is the fact that the applications for space, both inside and outside, have already exceeded the available space in the Department of Horticulture by many thousands of ft In Mr. Taylor Nebraska has a valuable friend at court and if the great State of Nebraska does not maintain her prestige at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, one disappointed man will be the Chief of the Department of Horticulture. I am now come to that part of my paper which I most appre - ciate, the end. I have looked forward with anticipations of keen pleasure to that general discussion which I now wish to precipi - tate by requesting you to ask me questions concerning the Expo - sition in so far as it relates to the Department of Horticulture. Mr. Hadkinson exhibited elevation8,maps and designs of the horticulture department at the World's Fair at St. Loui&gt; which reference was made during his remarks.

Dwyer — The general oversight of the estate and especially the landscape work is in the hands of Mr. Edward Burnett, a New York Landscape Architect. I have charge of the execution of this work. I Doubtless you and many other horticulturists of Nebraska who id the privilege of personal acquaintance with the late Mr. J. erling Morton have a better knowledge of his life work and ranger can possibly ha\ ■ We have had to rely rgely upon the evidence given by the planting already done at rbor Lodge. We have tried in newer work to follow out the and spirit of the original design wrought by the great je planter himself. In this we have been helped by the counsel some of Mr. Morton's older friends and every plan lias been oroughlv studied by the sons of Mr. Morton before the small - t shrub was planted. I Some of the first work was necessarily destructive. For ex - nple, the old orchard north and east of the house has been com - etely grubbed out. This orchard was the pride of Mr. Morton's lunger days but had greatly decayed and been partly cut out iring the last few years before his death. We also had to re - ne other trees in places where a number had been plant - ly for quick effect, for nurse trees, or other special pur - &gt;se. It has in most cases been easily seen which trees were anned to be removed and the number cut has been small though ere will of course be some others as the later planting eir growth and begin to crowd one another.

During the pi nter 20 large trees have been moved each with a large ball of jzen earth, and will greatly help the appearance of the new anting. The grove of white pine planted by Mr. Morton in 1890 has continued to make a rapid growth and now has a height of from </seg>
            <seg id="p175">HORTICULTUB* AT THE WOBLD's FAIK 175 20 to 30 feet. Many trees have a diameter of six inches at breast high. « This grove is a thing of beauty during all the year, a perfect windbreak in winter, and a shady fragrant walk in summer. I feel sure that in some of its sheltered recesses protected alike from the hot winds of summer and the freezing and thawin_ winter, many plants may be grown which are at present unknown in Nebraska. Our planting of last spring was mostly on a rec - tangular piece of land of about 10 acres in extent northeast of the house. The general plan was to plant on three sides of this area a rather heavy background of white pine, reinforced on the inside by various spruces and firs. Bordering these still working toward the center are irregular masses of deciduous trees inter - spersed with shubbery. The center comprising about a third of the whole area is open lawn. With a very few exceptions the trees planted have been those commonly used in this state. The American beech did not do well but River's Purple beech made an excellent growth and now appears in good condition. We lost a few pine and white birch but everything else did well and up to winter there was practical - ly no loss. Next vear we shall experiment with a few kinds not so well known and each year the Arboretum will be ex - tended until it includes all the ornamental trees and shrul value in this climate. It is designed that it shall be an object lesson to the people of Nebraska interested in beautifying their homes; a place where they may study and compare all the tree* and shrubs used in landscape gardening. Several gifts of trees for this purpose have been made to the Arboretum and all such trees will be tagged with the common name, the botanical name and the name of the giver. In Nebraska Ex-Governor Furnas, of Brownville, and Mr. James Dunlap, of Dwight, gave trees last spring and I am glad to say that they are all doing well. Me.

I would recommend that the report be adopted and the committee be left as it is. Ms. Barnard — People should remember that Nebraska is a big state. This committee was composed of the extreme north and the exteme east. If any man wants to change the score card it is all right, but the Genet is as generally grown as any apple we have. Some of them sometimes are poor, but when you get a good Genet you have as good an apple as then grown.

This paper deals with only a few of the diseases which are common to the apple. They will be discussed under the follow - ing general heads: 1st. Diseases of roots. </seg>

Rwt-vot. — One of the most destructive di- r the tiv the one commonly known as root-rot. It attacks trees of any I have seen trees one foot in diameter in the last - decay, which were up-rooted bj a strong wind. T: ■ 1 by a parasitic fungus (i?&lt; : a) which pro - duces a sort of dry rotting of the rc&gt;. I The fungus first attacks the bark just below the ground, or the ung roots near the surface and works its way into the larger ots. Soon after the attack, delicate white threads (mycelium) pear on the surface of the diseased parts. These threads work rough the ground from one root to another and thus continue e infection.

It is also further recommended that the dead be dug up and burned in order that the fungus might not ad from them. Crown-Gall. — This disease causes greatest loss in nursery stock as it is not common on older trees. The galls are dark, rough, protruding knots, growing most commonly from the crown of the tree and varying in size from that of a pea to that of the fist. The larger ones are not common and are only found on older DISEA- BOOTS </seg>            
            <seg id="p180">180 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY i trees. A badly affected tree may be detected by the sickly yel - low appearance of its foilage. It has not been proved that the disease exists in this state, but it is well to be on the alert for it. The nature of the disease has not been worked out to any ex - tent but it seems evident that it is contagious. It demands a careful study. If any of jou find anything that you think is crown-gall, I would like to have you send me specimens of it. It will not be published where the specimens are found. Preventive. — "It is recommended that all the affected trees be destroyed by burning, and all the trees grown in contact with trees thus affected should have their ro*ts dipped in Bordeaux mixture as a disinfectant. The ground on which the stock so diseased has laeen grown should be temporarily used for some other purpose than that of growing nursery stock." DISEASES OF THE TRUNK. Heart-rot. — This disease, similar to root-rot, is caused by two parasitic fungi (Polyponis Hispiduz) and (Monies AppJanatut). These fungi being wound parasides can only gain access to the living tissues through wounds. They do not act the same on the wood, as the one (Polyj&gt;on&lt;* Hixpiduti) causes a wet brown rot, while the other {Fome-s Applanatus) causes a dry white rot. Their fruits (sporophorex) are produced on the trunk of the tree in the form of brackets but do not appear until the disease has been at work for some time. These fruits bear numerous spores which are distributed by winds and insects. In this way they find their way to bark wounds where they germinate and produce threads which penetrate to the heart wood, causing its decay. JVmmUive. — Exercise every possible precaution to prevent bark wounds and if they should occur through accident, coat them with paint immediately. Destroy all fruits of the fungus as soon as they occur on the trunk. Destroy all trees affected by the disease as soon as they become worthless. DISEASES OF BRANCHES AND TWIG8. Blight. — This is a very serious bacterial disease, the germs of which are very minute and multiply with great rapidity. These germs enter the twigs through the tender growing point. </seg>
            <seg id="p181">181 DISEASES OF THE APPLE The presence of the disease upon the twigs may be recognized by the blackening of the bark and the withering of the leaves as though scorched by fire. The disease is very contagious as has been proved by inoccu - lations of healthy limbs with diseased bark. It is carried from tree to tree by winds and insects. The insects perhaps play the most important part, as they visit the diseased twigs for the sweetish juice on them and then fly to other twigs carrying the germs with them. The flowers also become infected by the insects which carry the pollen grains from flower to flower. The blight germs also stick to the insects and in this way they are carried to the flowers which they infect. The flowers are often killed in this way. Preventive. — "The preventive consists in removing apd burn - ing all the diseased twigs. In doing this great care should be taken to cut low enough to insure the removal of all germs." Bitter-rot Canker. — The bitter rot cankers are small tanker spots which occur on the limbs and twigs. They are called bitter - rot cankers because they are closely related to a disease known as bitter-rot of the fruit which will be discussed under the diseases of the fruit. These cankers have been found on branches of various sizes from that of very small twigs to limbs from three to four inches in diameter. On these limbs oblong sooty-black sunken patches occur varying in length from one to several inches. In many of these cankers regular transverse cracks caused by the drying out of the bark are very marked. As the bark dries out it ad - heres firmly to the wood and formsa fl attened spot on the diseased limb. Around the dead areas a healing layer of bark is formed which makes the cankered spots appear more and more sunken. This layer pushes up the dry bark around the edge of the spots and gives it a rough appearance. The formation of the canker spots probably starts at some wound. The fungus begins to grow and kills the bark and cambium. As a result no new wood is formed at the point where the cambium is killed. The fungus grows out from the point of infection until </seg>
            <seg id="p182">182 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL 8OC1ETY at the end of the growing season a large spot on the limb is dead. Aj ■'. . — This is a new disease having been discovered within the last year. Mr. Miles, a student at the State Uui\ ty. discovered the disease in the south eastern part of the state. He did some work on it but did not discover anything further than that it i &gt;d by a fungus. Mr. Miles was compel - led to drop 1 he took up government work. The disease seeni a serious one and demands a thorough igatioB. The diseased limbs are covered with small indentations about a quarter of an inch in diameter resembling pock marks. The bark in these indentations is killed down to the solid wood. This would naturally have the same effect on the limb as girdling. lihEASK- OF LEAVES AM) BTEMS. —The fungus which causes this disease until recently was considered to be a very simple one having only the temporary or summer stage. The investigations which have been carried on within the past three years prove that it is a very complex one having both a temporary and a per - manent stage. The investigations show that the apple scab is only a parasitic summer stage of a permaneut saprophyric fungus occuring on the fallen lea The disease occurs on the leaves in distinct, minute circular spots. 1 Ota spread from this central point keeping their circular outline and causing great distortion in the leaf by the unequal rate of growth of two surfaces. When it is abundant on the young leaves it causes them to wither and fall from the tree. As a result of this loss of foliage the food supply is greatly in - terfered with and the vitality of the tree is lost. The trees are, therefore, less able to resist unfavorable conditions. The trees which were seriously affected with scab in 19#i were most affected by the late snow storm last spring. Trees which were seriously affected by the scab in 1902 lost all their fruit and oliage while other trees in the same locality which were not affected retained enough of their fruit to make a fair crop under avorable conditions. </seg>
            <seg id="p183">183 DISEASK8 OF THE APPLE The bcab also causes a great loss by its attacks on the stems of the young fruit. If two or three scabs attack a young item they rob the fruit of its nourishment causing it to fall from the tree. The loss caused in this way occurs between the time the fruit sets and the time it is as large as hickory nuts. I do not believe that the scab caused all this premature falling but doubt - less it is responsible for the greater part of it. Bl'ujht. — The leaves are said to be blighted when they wither .iid hang on the diseased twigs, but usually this is not the The trouble is altogether in the twigs. The withering is caused by the food supply being eut off by the dying of the twjm. Rust. — This disease is not very common in the state a. - having appeared here only within the last few years. In some of the eastern states it is reported to be a great menace to the orchards and it is predicted that it will do a great deal of damage in this state in the future. The disease is characterized by the yellowish orange spot - the leaf. These spots are at first yellowish green but gradu - ally change to an orange. On the upper surface of the diseased sgot there appear numerous black pimples, while on the lower appear long pointed projections. In extreme cases these epott become so numerous that the entire foliage of an orchard, when observed from a distance, has a yellowish hue. When the foliage i§ thus affected the tree is robbed of its nourishment and rendered incapable of bearing good fruit. This disease is due to a fungus growing in the leaf which spends only part of its life on the apple and the remainder on the red cedar. The spores which are produced in the diseased spots on the leaf, are carried to an adjacent red cedar in the autumn by the wind. These spores germinate here on the red cedar and produce what is known as the "cedar apple."' In the spring the cedar apple matures and casts out numerous gelatinous projections which contain myriads of spores. These spores are conveyed to the apple leaves by insects and winds </seg>
            <seg id="p184">184 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY where they germinate and produce the leaf-rust, thus completing the cycle. Pr&lt; ' . — A rational treatment which is recommended is to destroy all cedars so far as possible. In case some cedars are too valuable to destroy, carefully cut out and burn all the cedar apples in the winter. DISEASES OF FKl'lT. Venturia Chlarospora.) — On the fruit,as on the leaves the spots first occur as minute circular olive green specks. Tl^s spots enlarge, keeping their circular outline until they are quarter of an inch in diameter or until they coalesce and cover greater portion with irregular patches. If the fruit is attai^et when young it becomes greatly distorted, for the fungus grow between the epidermis and the flesh, robbing the growing part o its nourishment. The growth of the parts attacked is stoppet and the fruit assumes various shapes. The apples thus affecte&lt; have fKTmarket value. A mild form of the disease perhaps does not hurt the market value of the fruit, but it is through this mil&lt; form that the worst forms are propagated and developed.

Br — There is perhaps no disease so destructive to the apple as the one known as bitter-rot. It was estimated by the National Apple Shippc-: eiatiou that this disease alone caused 110,000,000 worth of damage to the crop of Hum. The disease appears on the fruit at different times during the summer. The time of appearance varies with the age of the fruit, the temperature and humidity of the atmosphere, and the presence of spore distributing centers. The green fruit is scarce- </seg>
            <seg id="p185">185 DI8EA8S8 OF THE AI'PLK ly ever attacked as it contains a large amount of malic acid which probably kills the spores of the fungus. A warm moist climate favors the development of the disease. Dr. Vow Schrenk says, "numerous instances might be mentioned where the disease ap - peared in an orchard during the last part of Angust, after a few hot days, destroying the whole crop in three days. Cold weather usually checks the disease and may stop it altogether. "' The spore distributing centers are the cankers which have been described. The first appearance on the fruit is charaterized by little faint light brown spots under the skin. These spots spread rapidly from the centers outwards, thus keeping their circular outline. After a short time there appear around the center of the spot rings of black pimples. As these pimples become older they break through the epidermis and allow the spores of the disease to pass out in a thick sticky fluid which is readily soluble in water. This fluid is dissolved and transmitted to the healthy apples by rain drops. Relation of Cankers to Bitter-rot. — The cankered spots were discovered by R. H. Simpson of Illinois, who traced the areas of diseased apples to the sunken spots, ou the limbs. Numerous observations seemed to prove that the cankers were responsible for the infection of the apples. A number of experiments were carried on at the Illinois station which proved that the spores found in the cankers would produce the bitter-rot of the fruit. It was also proved that a canker would infect a cone shaped area of fruit through spores being transmitted from the canker to the apples by rain drops. IYwmliw. — ' t Ona of the best means of combating this disease will consist in cutting out all the cankers during the winter. These should be burned at once. All the diseased apples on the ground or tree should be collected and destroyed. As a further precaution, trees should be sprayed with standard Bordeaux mixture at least once before the buds open, and again frequently from mid- Bummer until the fruits are almost ripe. </seg>
            <seg id="p186">186 Y£ R k " R I'ATF r LT^XT^C a L I yri ■ PREVENTION OF APPLE SCAB. BY VAL KEYSER. In order to successfully combat any disease of our fruit trees, like the apple scab, it is quite necessary to understand the nature of the disease and to know something about the organism which causes it. Apple scab ( Yaituria chlorospora) is described by Dr. Bessey in the Horticultural Report of 1901. However, it may be well to say a few words describing the nature of the fungus in connec - tion with the methods of prevention. The fungus that produces the scab spots works not only on the fruit, but also on the leaves and young twigs. The orcha may say that he is particularly interested in keeping the scab off of the fruit, but he will find that it is also necessary to prevent it from growing on the leaves if he expects to harvest fruit free from spots and specks. I do not wish to be understood t&gt; that the man who merely does the mechanical labor, of applying the preventive, must be a trained botanist, but some one con - nected with the work must have a fair knowledge of the life his - tory of the fungus causing the d THE Y AUSINO SCAB. When the fungus first makes its appearance, and in fact all through the early part of the season, it lives just under the outer skin and does not send its filaments {hyphae) into the of the host, either on the apples or on the \e&amp;\ You have probably noticed, that by peeling a scabby apple we remove the &lt;! portion, unless some other disease, as Pink Rot {Cephalothtcium roseum) or some of the other common apple rots, happens to accompany the scab. In such cases, often a large portion of the apple is decayed. There is essentially no difference between the appearance of scab fungus in its younger stage on the leaves and twigs and its appearance on the young fruits; and the spores which produce the fungus on the fruit may also produce it on the leaves or twi&gt;_ The spots as they first appear are a dark olive green. On the </seg>

HOW THE FUNGU8 Sl'K The fungus causing tin u the fruits and leaves develops apidly and produces another set of spores call' amer )ores. " These spon ipable of producing more scab spots, Inch they do in profusion, and this, of com o spend, especially when conditions are favorable. If no pre - entive measure is taken, the value of the apple crop is greatly educed. The scab spots on the apples are. as a rule not the greatest source of infection since the apples are usually rom the orchard. It seems clear upon a momei lat the leaves are the chief source of inflection for the ensuing ear. This is actually the case. The scab u the leaves ontinue to produce '-summer spores" until conditions are no onger favorable, and then the fungus ceases to grow on the sur - ace, and its filaments penetrate into the tissue of the leaf. These ame fungus filaments remain in the leaves over winter. They lange their habits from Parasitic to Saprophytic and produce nother kind or s'pores within the tissue of the fallen leaves, de - rending on the breakiug up of the leaves for their liberation, which usually takes place in the spring. If there were any practical way of destroying the leave - should be done. It might be possible, where orchards are culti - vated throughout tin to work the falling leaves, contain - ing the spores, into the soil and in this way dispose of them, but it is a question yet to be solved whether or not by cultivation we destroy the spores. Since the spores require certain conditions of heat and moisture and the proper host in order to germinate they may remain in the soil for a long time and still retain their vitality, and when blown about with the dust of the surface soil, infect the trees. Where orchards are seeded down to clover or some such crop, or if the weeds are allowed to grow, as is some - times recommended for orchards which have come into bearing, </seg>
            <seg id="p188">188 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY in such cases destroying the leaves as a method of preventing the scab is out of the question. SPRAYING. We are indebted to Professor Clinton of the Illinois Experi - ment station for our present knowledge of the life history of the apple scab. Spraying seems to be the only practical method of preventing t. Liquid Bordeaux mixture, the standard fungicide, is the most effective preventive if applied in the right way and at the right time. For the first application use 4 to 4 mixture (4 pounds of cop per sulphate and 4 pounds of quicklime to 50 gallons of water and spray while the trees are dormant. It is much better to use Bordeaux mixture than the copper sulphate alone, because afte you have sprayed a tree there is some evidence of your work This spraying is intended to catch the spores which have lodge&lt; in the bud (scales. The second application should come just before the flower buds have opened and at this time it is not safe to use over a 2 to 2 mixture to avoid injuring the tender leaves which are at that time unfolding and pushing out. The leaves are most susceptible at this time but if it is a period of slight precipitation and the wind does not blow much, as sometimes occurs, this spraying could probably be dispensed with. The third application just after the petals of the flowers have fallen (that is, following the regular routine) is the most import - ant and should never be neglected. Use the 4 to 4 mixture and this time add some Arsenical insecticide, as paris green £ pound, London purple pound, or lead arsenate \ pound, to catch the codling moth. The fourth application should be about two or three weeks after the third, and should consist of the usual 4 to 4 mixture. There are a few points which it is essential to observe in con - nection with the work of spraying. Probably the most import - ant is that the infection comes from the ground. This is obvious when we find in nine cases out of ten that the blossom end of </seg>
            <seg id="p189">189 DI8EA8E8 OF THE COTTONWOOD AND LOMBARDY POPLAR the apples and the under surface of the leaves are affected first, and most seriously. Another is that the Bordeaux should be properly made and should be sprayed in among the branches of the tree, if possible, so as to cover the lower side of the leaves as well as the ujiper. Still another is that wet seasons favor the growth of the disease, while dry seasons tend to retard its growth. No hard and fast rules can be laid down as to just the time by the calendar to spray, because Mother Nature does not always bring the trees into leaf or bloom the same date year after year and the orchardist must rely on his own judgment. In presenting this paper if I have ommitted too many of the essential details, one can find a better and fuller description of the disease in Dr. Bessey's article entitled "Apple Scab" in the report of 1901. THE DISEASES OF THE COTTONWOOD AND LOM - BARDY POPLAR. BY B. K. H. d'aLLEMAND, ABAPAHOE INTRODUCTION From investigations through leadtng tree men in regard to the length of life of the cottonwood, it appears that the life period varies in different regions. The amount of available moisture seems to be an important factor in prolonging the life of the tree. An observation that shows this result was made on several rows of trees running from one ridge across a "draw" to another ridge. These trees were planted forty years ago. Those on the ridges began to fail in from fifteen to twenty years, while those in the "draw" are still in good thrifty condition. It is when the trees begin to fail that they are the most subject to diseases. In general it is found that the most thrifty cottonwoods are on the low moist lands. LEAF FUNGI. A considerable number of fungi have been reported as occuring </seg>
            <seg id="p190">190 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICCLTCRAL SOCIETY on the leaves of the cottonwood. Only two are of sufficient im - portance for consideration at this time. (a — The most important of the fungi tha attack the leave&gt; rust, which has caused great damage. This produces colored spots which break out from the epiderm of the leaf. It is generally known throughout the state as co tonwood rust and is often quite harmful. Many observation have been made upon this rust and upon conditions affecting it growth. It attacks the leaves in the same manner as the rust o oats attack its host. This di liicli some j very dfi rimental to the growth of the trees, causes the leaves to tur yellow and fall to the ground. Any condition which reduces the vitality of the trees, can - to be more readily a prey to these fungi, which appear to be more destructive in dry regions. This rust does not attack the much under normal conditions. Poorly nourished I and those which are affected by drouth at regular growing all an easy prey to these fungi. The rust seems checked b; abundant and regular supply of water to the ground. Especially in a dry region frequent cultivation induces a healthy condition of trees, until it is too late in the fall for the rust to do much damage. Crowding together too many cottonwoods on a small space makes demands on the soil for more water than it can supply and starves the trees for both lack of water and nourish - ment, thus bringing about a favorable condition for the rust fungus. If a good healthy condition is desired, the number of must be in proportion to the surface area demanded by each tree. Th. Powdery Ml 1 - mother of leaf fungus which occurs on the V id produces white spots, or thick coatings on one or both sides, but in no region has it ca much damage. DISEASES AKKECTIXi. THE Wool) AND TERMINAL BUDS. of cottonwood and popular. The rapid destruction of the cottonwood it due in part to a disease which from investigations now in progress, appears to be caused by </seg>
            <seg id="p191">191 DI8EA8B8 OF THE COTTONWOOD AND LOMBARDT POPLAR Icteria, which probably gain admission into the living tissue of b wood through wounds and then gradually cause the wood to cay. The disease begins in the young twigs and branches and adually works its way downward into the older branches until finally reaches the trunk of the tree. In a diseased tree many the terminal twigs are dead, while the heart wood, of many anches that are still living are of a deep brown. By the time e tree is killed by the disease the wood is of but little value, ing soft and punky, and redish brown in color. The disease )rks through the entire wood of the tree. (b) Pore fungus. — There is a large fungus belonging to the pore fungi, of the genus Fomm reported on cottonwood in - counties of the state. This has been determined planatus but appears to have very slight effect upon the health of the tree. The fruiting part of the fungus comes out a few feet above the ground on the south side of the tree trunks affected by this para- The fungus begins its work in the wood near the base of the unk and works upward and through all parts of the wood. The fected wood shows marked horizontal strata in which the fun - tous filaments are especially abundant, while in the intervening rata only a few filaments are present. The fungus first des - oys the secondary layers of the cell wall, and then the lamellae ther partially or entirely, and leaves in place of the cell, inass - s of mycelium threads and fragments of cell walls, making the ood solf and punky. The longer the tree is allowed to stand le worse tin us of mycelium threads spread through the ood, in time making the wood wholly valueless. The tree from which specimens were sent to be experimented upon grew in a leltered belt of trees mm Nehawka. They were forty years Id and averaged about three feet in diameter. No trace of the isease except through the large fruits was noticed until the tree as cut down for lumber last winter. The tree appeared in a irifty condition. When cut down the diseased condition of the wood was found to extend up the tree about ten feet. All the wood above this punky wood made good lumber. None of the </seg>
            <seg id="p192">192 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY trrounding trees were affected. Diseases of tbis kind seem to limited to south eastern Nebraska. Dili fungus. — The disease which has been most de tractive to the Lombardy poplar is reported as Dothtoia xphae v. This is a disk fungus which affects the branches particu arly those of the upper part of the tree causing them to die on after the other until the whole tree is affected by this disease. Th pores of this fungus are club-shaped and constricted in the mid lie. The diseases of the cottonwood and popular are very sim ar in that they are so closely related, belonging both to the sam botanical genus. IXSV The insects have done some damage to the cottonwood and poplars, but not to any great extent in the past few years. The following are some of the injurious insects. (a i Cotton irood Dagger Moth. The injury tn the trees is done mostly by the larvae of the moth on account of its preference for these trees as a food plant, and some years ago in some regions nearly stripped the trees of their foilage. Leaf Ftcdiivj Caterpillars of various kinds. These are anted less injurious to the trees than any other of the ins* There are two species of boring beetles which perforate the wood in all directions running under the bark and then boring into the wood. These appear to be more abundant upon poplars than upon the cottonwood. Whenever the wood of a tree is decayed on the inside, the out - side appearing in a somewhat healthy condition, it is caused by a disease and not by insects as we are lead to believe. From a number of investigations through reports and letters from prominent tree men of the state I find that a very small percent of the trees are killed by insects. R. A. Miller of Ashland while assisting in cutting a large number of cottonwood - last year which averaged twenty-five years old and from two to three feet in diameter, found very few which seemed to be effected by insects.

(bi Keep the ground well watered, which keeps the trees in a good healthy condition, and thus they are less attacked by disea- (e) To keep diseases from spreading in the timber it would be profitable to keep the dead branches cut off and wounds painted, which will also aid in keeping out fungi. The dead wood should be cleared away. This has been proved to be successful. By cutting oil dead limbs in time, the disease may be c from entering the main body of the tree. DISCUSSION. Mr. Snodorass — I am pleased to know that four young men have entered into this business, and glad to make their acquaint - ance, and I am glad to know that each one of us believes that prevention is better than cure. This subject is so nearly allied to the one upon which I B] to you yesterday that I can hardly refrain from saying something more. I wanted to say yesterday a few words in regard to this wholesale butchery in the matter of trimming trees. It almost makes the heart of man, who loves a tree, bleed to see the indis - criminate butchery that is practiced in trimming trees in this city which otherwise might be a thing of beauty. I am glad to learn that the young men brought out here are on the right track in their early days and when they have their whole life before them. I hope to see the time when we will see the effect of the papers that have been read here today in our hearing. I want to make a plea for shade trees. I want to raise my hand against the butchery of shade trees. I crave the ability to write in del of trees. If I had such ability I would write an article i month.

Young man, do you know that when you plant a tiny elm tree and take the proper care of it, you have planted one o the grandest monuments you will ever have. I planted a littl elm tree one for each of my children born. It is a very pleasan thought to know that if that tree is taken care of it will grow fo one hundred years and it will stand there in its grandeur am beauty for a hundred years more before it commences to die then it takes that grand old tree one hundred years more befor it is ready to lay down and die.

Mr. Scott — I find a number of elm trees are growing out in the sand hills in Hooker county along side of cottonwoods and make vigorous growth and they are growing without an insect or disease of any kind. Mr. Williams — I am somewhat in favor of the adoption of the let alone, go as you please doctrine, but when I see our court yard and lawns denuded of splendid trees the cutting of them down, I thought it might be a good thing if we had a govern - ment forest tree here for there is a wholesale denuding of timber </seg>

The weather conditions remained during the year much the same as they were the last year the rainfall being much more than normal. In the early spring there was a promise of an abundant harvest of fruit of all kinds and the flowering shrubs and plants were in good condition. This favorable out look continued until the SOth of April when there came a storm from the northwest accompanied by sleet and snow and a falling thermometer until the ice on the ponds was an inch thick. Some of the apple trees notably the Willow Twig were in full bloom and as a matter of course these blossoms were killed, and all others were so far advanc - ed including plums and cherries that there were but few specimens of each variety left and some varieties were all killed. The Whitney No. 20 bloomed last of all the apples and hence escaped with the least injury. There were several varieties that develop - ed from one to one dozen apples apiece among these were the Wealthy, Maidens Blush and two varieties names unknown. The Wealthy seemed to come through the storm in the best condition of any unless we except the Whitney and developed some beauti - ful fruit, in fact the behavior of this variety with me so far entit - les it to the first rank from this section except in vigor and growth of the tree, in this quality the Northwest Greening stands at the head. Cherries are making a good growth and trees three years old have formed fruit buds for a good crop next year, while the older trees are unusually full, the varieties are all behaving well except the Baldwin and the Yellow Glass, which are on too low ground. A two year old Vilna Sweet ripened one cherry and it was beauty. It is difficult to decide which of the sour cherries i - having in the most satisfactory manner, the Wolf might be men tioned as the leading variety in thriftiness and fruitfuluess follow ed closely by the Wild Goose.

Our special care has been with the peony, as so many things like Asalias, Kalmias and Rhododendrons will do nothing with us. The peony takes their place and with its marvelous improve - ment in recent years it is fully equal to any flower that blooms both in fragrance and loveliness and it is the hardiest of all. Importations have been made from Japan, Holland, Franc and England, besides securing the finest in our own land, whic seem to be equal to the best of the imported. We have now collection of about forty thousand in four hundred choice varie It is one of the fine collections of the world, and calls fo the best come from the leading florists of New York, and from Manitoba. The development of these flowers has been watched with the closest scrutiny, and materials are being gathered for a complete international manual. UWe have articles and illustrations from England and Canada, d from leading Horticulturists of our own country. Careful inves - tigation shows that it is wonderfully adapted to the great North - west. The trouble will be to supply the demand. The most that are raised in Nebraska are shipped east, and when people wake up there will be a great call from the west. Columbines are giving the best of satisfaction. We keep about fifty kinds mixed and they continue along time in bloom and give an almost infinite variation of form and color. They are very hardy except the Coxrelia which needs the pro - tection of the screen and even then it is short lived, but it is a sort of a mother flower, readily crossing with other sorts and greatly improving their beauty. We are well pleased with the Gaillardia. This has been wonderfully improved, till now, there are fifty kinds. I secured ast fall some of the finest imported, and also the seed of the wild Gaillardia, which grows in the Republican valley. These [ intend to cross with the choicest of the imported to see if we cannot get a perenniaf that will be perfectly hardy. </seg>

I have tried quite a number of Pyrethrums but they have not been entirely satisfactory. We will have to wait another year before reporting. Oriental Poppies have sustained themselves and have given great pleasure and satisfaction. I am now on the track of new kinds which will give us a wider variety of color. The Phlox is growing in favor all the while. Last spring I paid out $20 for what I planted on a plat twelve feet square. They were the finest money could buy. There is an intense delight in raising these flowers from seed. I have in this way developed many new sorts of surpassing beauty, fully equal to some of oar choicest imported favorit To secure a continuous bloom, allow some to stand over. Plant some in the spring, and they will bloom a little later. Then have same seedlings of the same year, and yon have con - tinuous flowering till hard frost, or if you have only one bed. cat the first stems back and that will retard them. We are more and more impressed with these flowers. Their beauty and hardiness make great favorites of them. They have been developed by European florists from our own little wild Phlox, but such splendid varieties have now been established that their progress promises great things. It is very interesting to call new and lovely creations out of the unknown, and this you are doing when you raise Phloxes from seed. Last spring we planted a large family of the ovis, but wait another year before reporting. l'ERKNMAL ASTKKS. When we think that there are over forty kinds of these grow - ing wild along our western streams, and in the Rockies. We are impressed with their possibilities. I gathered the seeds of some choice ones last summer in the mountains, and 1 hope much for them. I have several kinds of great promise.

Hitherto we have not paid much attention to flowers like the above which must be planted in the spring, but such improve - ments have been made that we are falling into line. I have pur - chased a large stock for spring planting of the very choicest. We ought to have an immense amount of elms. Let a few trees say from Ellwanger and Barry and cut off the limbs and graft in the wat of one year olds just as you do apples, using great care to get a perfect splice and you will succeed. About twenty eight years ago I planted three Scotch Elms in York. Now they are Majestic trees, but they sprout from the wat like the Black Locust. This can be obviated by grafting in the wat of our native elms. TAMARISKS. I secured ten kinds of these. I think the silver rather takes the lead. This is called Prussian, Amour, Amnunses and Odessianna. All one and the same. The African, French, Tit - andra, and the tree Tamarisk do well and the others were not satisfactory. They do better on high dry ground and will probably make splendid hedges west of 100th Meridian. There is a growing demand for these shrubs caused by persis - tently introducing them to the people.

Much attention has been paid to this department and we have made two large importations from France. Of course, it was an experiment and some failed while others have succeeded. We have now about twelve kinds of Spireas, all doing well and they are adapted to our climate and soil. Dutsias have been planted but they might as well be stricken from the list. I tried every way to keep the beautiful little Gacilis which is so charming in the east. Sometimes I covered them in winter, sometimes put them under a screen, but the poor little things pined away in utter homesickness and all are gone. </seg>

We have the old sweet scented Coronasis, French Mammoth, Grandiflora, Semail, Seniail Ericta, Avalancb, Gerdons The Golden, the Double Dwarf, and several other kinds, and they are all hardy and give the best of satisfaction. LILACS. Of these we have gathered fifty kinds and with one or two exceptions they are all hardy. We have through the press often called the attention to "Lilacs that are trees," Pekininses and Japonica. People have often been disappointed in these because they in - sist in getting small ones and planting them in the sod. I have some that are germing trees five years from tiny switches, about fourteen feet high and three inches through. They grow about as fast and large as our native ash and their introduction has been one of the triumphs of horticulture. In the fifty kinds there is a marked variation of form and foli - age and if you wished to raise them for this alone it would pay, but when to this you add the charm of their splendid flowers, you have quite an acquisition. ELMS. I have long believed that the number of our deciduous trees could be largely increased, so I secured about eighteen kinds of Elms. They were frozen to death in transit, but I grafted scions from them. Of course the limbs from dead trees were none of the best, and yet I have now about eight kinds growing. These range from the delicate Japan with leaves, the size of a dim the oval leaf of the Campordown. These last are usually top - grafted and they make one of the most robust and beautiful of our usurpers.

That the Illinois State Horticultural Society has long since passed the stage of infancy is evidenced by the fact that two years more will mark a half century of active work in scientific fruit growing. The state, recognizing the value of the work done, shows its appreciation by an annual appropriation of $5,000. This enables the Horticultural Society to foster three district organizations, the Northern, Southern and Central, to whom it gives $150 each annually. Six thousand volumes of its reports are distributed Representatives were present at the meeting from Michigan, Iowa, South Dakota, Indiana, Missouri, and Nebraska. The fruit exhibit filled to overflowing the* room assigned and additional space was provided in a room adjoining. Rows of fancy apples alternated with pears, quinces, and even plums and grapes which had been well preserved in cold storage. Senator Dunlap, president of the American Apple Growers Association, brought out some remarkable facts concerning the foreign market and our opportunities there. The foreign demand for good fruit is almost unlimited. The crop raised in France and other European countries is off the market by the middle of December. They do not put fruit in cold storage as we do. There is but one apple cold storage house in France, and it was not built primarily for that purpose Their process is to store apples and let them shrivel. After January 1st the only apples on the market are this shriveled fruit which sells for 18 cents per pound; or specimens grown under glass, which retail at from 30 to 40 cents apiece. The withered fruit would not be eaten at all by Americans, and the price of the hot house product puts it out of reach of all but the wealthy An idea of the cordial reception accorded American apples may gained from the fact that while last year 76,000 barrels were shipped to Hamburg, this year 908,000 barrels have been sold there. London last year absorbed 300,000 barrels: this year 1 barrels; a quick and marvelous increase. </seg>

Fruit growers were ad - vised to avoid it until its usefulness shall have been determined by the experiment station. ♦ * # Considerable encouragement may be found for fruitgrower the Central states in the report of Mr. Simpson, who spent last winter studying the methods of apple growers and packers in California. The Californian pays $50 to $100 per acre for his land; $50 more getting it in condition to irrigate, and $10 to $15 per acre annually for irrigating privileges. Having fertilized the ground raised, picked, and packed the fruit, he pays |800 per car to get it to Chicago, where it sells for enough more than locally grown fruit to make it profitable, not because of superior quality, but because it is graded and packed with greater skill. "When the apple growers of the central states learn to grade and pack their fruit, "' Mr. Simpson was informed, "California will be out of it so far as the Chicago market is concerned." Dr. T. J. Burrill of the State University urged the importance of lining streets and highways with shade trees. It is a horticul - tural fact that no where on earth is there a section favored with a greater variety of native trees available for this purpose than the central and eastern part of the United States. Two lots lying almost side by side in an Illinois town were offered for sale. One had four shade trees, two outside and two inside the walk. The price asked 00.

They sold to a neighboring evaporator for 30 to 35 cents per 100 pounds, more than paying for the labor. He had very little loss by grading at picking time, and received $10. - 000 for his 100 acres of welj developed fruit. * * * </seg>
            <seg id="p207">207 ILLINOIS HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY CONVIHTIOH Among the many problems attendant upon marketing fruit, perhaps none is assuming more interest to apple growers than the question of the most desirable package in which to ship their products. The barrel has always been the great standby. But the fact that barrels which cost 34 cents last June were scarce this fall at 50 and 60 cents has called attention sharply to the fact that the barrel can only be made of a few kinds of timber, and this is getting scarce. This means a constantly increasing cost of material, and we must in the near future find some other available wood or else abandon the barrel. The shortage of 1902 when in some sections it was almost impossible to secure barrels for any price, has not been forgotten. The importance of the matter has led Prof. Blair of the Uni - versity of Illinois to make a very comprehensive study of the sit - uation, and at a recent meeting of the Illinois Horticultural soci - ety lie presented the following suggestions: "The package sells the fruit," is a well known fact in the ap - ple market. Success lies as much in the attractiveness of the package and placing of the fruit, as it does in growing the prop - er kinds of fruit. In determining the form of package to be used it must be borne in mind that there are three kinds of trades to be supplied; the export, wholesale and retail. The barrel is a most undesirable package in which to export fruit from the fact that it can be rolled. This seemingly unim - portant point becomes suggestive, however, when it is remem - bered that every time a barrel is kicked and rolled over, practi - cally every apple in the barrel is jostled more or less, and "two jostles make a bruise." In addition, the barrel is too large a compartment holding too much fruit without any partition to re - lieve the pressure. Whether the barrel stands upon one end or upon its side, the apples at the bottom are subjected to too much weight from those above. If apples must be exported in barrels, the smaller the barrels, the better to prevent jarring and bruising the fruit. </seg>
            <seg id="p208">208 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY In the"" home market a connection of interests arises between the wholesaler who wants the apple package to be as large as possible, and the retailer, who demands a package small enough to be convenient for his retail trade. Popular favor seems to be turning to the bushel box. Perhap the time may come when the choicest apples will be sold lik peaches and grapes, in handy baskets. This will result in ma terially increased consumption. If grapes were sold in bushe boxes and peaches by the barrel, the consumption would be fa less than now, because of the inconvenient size of the package. Before we shall have progressed so far as the apple basket. Prof. Blair looks for the gradual abandonment of the barrel and the adoption of the bushel box . This will present apples to the consumer in so convenient a form that many a man who would feel that a barrel of apples would be an elephant on his hands will buy several bushel boxes in succession. For wholesale trade the barrel will probably hold in favor. Those for winter apples should be perfectly tight. It is a pop - ular mistake to believe that barrels should be ventilated. Win - ter fruit in ventilated packages wilts and shrivels. For retail trade the bushel box is here to stay. Apple boxes won't roll, they "sit tight'' wherever they are placed, cannot be rolled about like barrels, and containing less, they bruise fewer apples. The rise in the price of barrel material scores another point for the box, since it can be made of relatively poor material. Coop - erage comes high and three boxes can be made for less than one barrel. The apple box of the future should be light, strong and clean. It should also be tight. Those with too wide cracks allow the fruit to be pressed against the edges resulting in bruises and in - cisions in the skin. Growers who now market their supplies in boxes are getting from 30 to 50 per cent more than for the fruit marketed in barrels. The adoption of the apple box, bringing larger consumption and an increased price, carries with it, however, two very im- </seg>
            <seg id="p209">209 WINNING FIGHT WITH OLD BOREAS portant requirements, i. e. more skillful packing and better quali - ty of fruit. The grading must be done with utmost care; and many packers will find it difficult to get help skillful enough for this purpose. Put the inferior fruit in the larger package — the barrel. Apples for the box trade must be even, regular, very choice, and packed with precision. The man who puts both good and poor stock in the same package receives a price based only on the poorer grade. Label the box Number One, Fancy or Extra Fancy, and put on youi own special brand. Make a reputation for that brand, and customers will pay the same price or even higher if neces - sary to get the fruit of that same brand — "Weighed and not found wanting." To show the lack of uniformity in apple packages, Prof. Blair had on exhibition 28 styles of apple boxes and barrels bought in thejopen market. He is hoping that the day may come when apples shall be marketed in uniform packages, graded according to certain well established grades, that the public may know what to buy, and just what to expect. WINNING FIGHT WITH OLD BOREAS. S. HARK I moved to Minnesota in 1857, and lived there five years. It is a bleak, cold state — sometimes the mercury goes to 40 below zero, and even lower. When I lived there I no more thought of raising apples than oranges, but persistency and brains have won. Lwas astonished to see the marvelous display of great, beauti - ful apples at the Minnesota State Horticultural meeting which would put many of our western states to blush. I think the dis - play fully equal to that of Kansas or Nebraska. The enthusiasm of success was apparent everywhere. The Minnesota society has a membership of 1,430, and the number is constantly increasing, and the enthusiam is contagious. </seg>

I was agreeably surprised at the opening exercises — instead of a few gathered in a close, small room, where the Nebraska society usually meets, they were in a large, commodious church, and it was well filled. Exercises opened with the magnificent organ then a song splendidly rendered, then a prayer by the pastor. The watchword of the society is expansion-expansion in fruit growing-expansion in membership. tA resolution was passed looking to a permanent home on a rge scale for the society, and with the growth of the horticul - ral interests this will soon be an absolute necessity. The society is not content to humdrum along, but is devising every means to arouse an interest and increase its numbers. There are horticultural giants in the ranks — men like Prof. Greene, whose efforts are part of the history of the state. Mr. Wedge, the president, is a progressive man. Mr. Latham, the secretary, is always at it, administering the affairs of his office with energy an economy. So much depends on a first secretary, one not content simply to be, but to do. There were many noted visitors from abroad. Prof. Hanson of South Dakota, a man of world-wide fame, also Mr. Norby, from the same state, who is a successful horticulturist and a pro - gressive man. Both these men are of Swedish birth, and one is impressed with the presence and force of their nationality. !Mr. Patten of Iowa, the man who evolved Patten's Greening, ras there.

There was a special discussion on the strawberry, to which the state seems to be well adapted.

Prof. Ilansen of South Dakota was on hand. He is working miracles with the sand cherry. He is improving the size and flavor, and selecting or propagation the sorts that are free from blight or rust. The &gt;rofessor has traveled in Russia and watched closely the methods here, and is experimenting himself on a large scale.

All trees planted here about 2,000, those furnish - by the society included, have made a fine growth during 1908, from two to four feet. They have about all recovered from destructive hail storm of two years ago, except a few that re then killed outright. As this work is to inform planters I 8t first say that I do not irrigate but use only dry buffalo grass d, and get good healthy growth with clean cultivation only, ■ther, that I find all two year old trees as sent out by nur a all headed too high for this climate; in fact they are worth - i. They refuse to grow here with a stem higher than 6 to £ and if planted with crown, say three feet high, the top s and shoots grow from lower stem say (j to 8 inches from &gt;und, and of course the dead part of the stem has to be cut ly anyhow, so I can only advise planting trees one year old open ground in northwest Nebraska, and cut them back to &gt;ut six inches. Once they start that way they do well. I ac - nt for that by the fact that the evaporation of our dry atmos - &gt;re takes more water from stem than the roots can furnish the t year, the stem has to die. They all do this by the thousand, lile one year whips cut back get a good start the first year. I have now tested all catalogue plums: have all Americanas in bearing, and recommend for planting in Northwest first the Sandoz, a wild one I found here; and Wyant, Bixby, Snooks and De Soto, the biggest part of the first of which I have no trees for sale but can furnish free on demand lots of scions for graft - ing. First, 1 was experimenting for hardy kinds. Now I find all Americanas hardy enough. But such as De Soto and Wyant, too late in ripening.

            <seg id="p218">218 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL 8OCIKTT union there is strength and security, so in the fall as soon as the ng duties are all over, the old birds gather together their family into a single flock, or "covey,*' to spend the winter. At they frequent the open fields, feeding on the waste grain to be found there, but as the weather grows cold they gradually seek the more sheltered draws and thickets, where they find better protection. At night they sleep closely huddled together on the ground, forming a compact circle with their heads pointed outward and their tails together, in order to retain the heat of their bodies, but even this excellent plan does not always suffice to keep the poor birds warm, and often after severe snowstorms whole coveys are found in this position, frozen. And then, too hawks and owls prey largely upon them at this season, while the long strings of mangled bodies hung by the neck and exposed for sale in the markets show the terrible severity of the destruction by pot-hunters. Indeed Bobwhite has an extremely hard time of it during the winter. Along in April what birds are left of the covey, if any at all, separate into pairs, and Mr. Bobwhite, after having secured a wife through his personal charms, mounts a fence-post and pro - claims his success in ringing notes, announcing to the world that he is now at home, or hopes soon to be, and sore enough, early in May, hidden away in the tall grass or in a bush is the nest of which the owner seems so proud — a saucer-shaped depression in the ground lined with dry grasses. Every day an additional egg is placed therein until the set is completed, and it may be anywhere from a dozen to twenty-five,thongh generally about fifteen. They are pure white, unless stained by the grass on which they lay. Mrs. Bobwhite, of course, attends to the greater part of the hatching process, and so attentive is she to her duty that she will almost allow herself to be trod upon rather than leave the nest, instances having been recorded where she was killed by mowing machines rather than do so, while her husband not only sees to it that she does not go hungry while so engaged, but occasionally he relieves her entirely and sits himself. And if she should be killed from any cause,he will very likely perform the whole duty of incubation </seg>

After about three weeks the little Bobwhites appear. These are hardy little midgets, covered with a soft down, and hungry, too, for they commence looking for food as soon as they are hatched, and have been seen running about with pieces of shell sticking to them. The mother acts just like a hen does toward a brood of little chicks and at the sign of the least danger she gives a warning note, whereupon the flock scatters, and remain quiet nntil reunited by a surpressed call from her when the danger has passed. The color of these little ones so nearly accords with the surrounding grass that it is very unusual to be able to find one when they remain motionless, and so they generall escape unharmed. After the first brood is two or three weeks old, the parents begin a second setting of eggs, somewhat smaller than the first one,averaging about twelve in number,and the labor of raising another brood is taken up. Rarely even a third brood is raised. By September all the young ones are grown, or nearly so, and the "coveys" are formed for the coming winter. The flight of the Bobwhite is swift and straight, and is accom - panied by a loud whirring sound, due to the rapid beating of the short, concave wings, but it is rarely sustained for long, and a single flight cannot be protracted much more than a mile. They are probably the best runners of all our birds, and can more effectually elude persuit in this manner than by flight. In addi - tion to the well known Bobwhite! call of the male, both -■ have a sad, sweet call for reassembling scattered "coveys, "and a low twittering when first discovered or otherwise alarmed. But many are the pleasing traits of this bird, when we come to amine closely its food habits we are more than ever struck with admiration, for as a devourer of noxious insects and weed - it has no superior. In a recent government paper detailing the food of this bird the following facts are presented: Animal matter constitutes 14.93%, vegetable matter 8 Of the former class are beetles, 2.5»5% grasshoppers, 2.83 bugs, 0.87 c / ( caterpillars, 0.48 £ miscellaneous insects and </seg>
            <seg id="p220">220 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTCKAL SOCIETY » ther invertebrates such as spiders, myriapods,etc. Insects are most eaten from May to August forming 31.5% of the food of that period, and are almost entirely injurious species, many such as are rarely eaten by other birds as the Colorado Potato beetle, the 12-Spotted Cucumber beetle, Bean leaf beetle, Click beetles, May beetles, Weevils, Army worms, Cutworms, Rocky Mountain locusts and Chinch bug. During the long breeding season it keeps the parents busy supplying the many hungry little mouths with insects, and as the young grow very fast a large amount of food is required for them. Single stomachs have contained* 30 Rocky Mountain locusts, over 100 Potato beetles or over 500 Chinch-bugs. The vegetable element consists of grain, 23. edsoO.T fruit 8.53% and other miscellaneous vegetable matter 2.1 Of the seeds, which constitute the bulk of the bird's food, most are the seeds of noxious weeds and these have been taken in the following amounts in single stomachs: Buttonwood, 30; Smart weed, 200 to 300; Sheep Sorrel, 500; Rag-weed, 1,&lt;mmi ; Crab - grass, 1,000 ;Pigeon grass 5,000; Pig-weed, lo.iji &gt;u. These show the great usefulness of the Bobwhite as a weed suppressor. The grain is composed of corn (19.14% ), wheat (3.04 %) and Kafir corn, millet, oats, rye, etc., (1.4-tf % ). None of this is taken while sprouting and little if any from the sheaves, but it is picked up in the stubble where it would otherwise be wasted, so this point cannot be urged against the bird as some have attempted to do, Fruit is eaten mainly in December when it forms S of the food aud is mainly sumac berries. Wild grapes are also largely eaten, and a small amount of buds and lea It is thus perfectly evident that the Bobwhite is of incalculable economic value, and if left unmolested and given its deserved protection would save thousands of dollars to the farmers of our state. No farmer should allow the Bobwhites on his farm to be killed, and if it is at all possible to give any of our "game" birds absolute protection, Bobwhite should be the first to re - ceive it. Under the present laws this bird is protected except during the four weeks in November and the daily bag of each </seg>

In short, it remains with the farmer of this state to decide where the Bobwhite is of the most value — on the epicures' table or devouring Chinch-bugs by the hundred in the grain fields. AESTHETIC VALUE OK BIRDS. In the forgoing pages and in the paper of last year the economic value of our commoner birds has been rather fullv cussed, and a careful perusal of these sketches cannot fail to emphasize the importance of these creatures from the practical agriculturists' point of view. He cannot help but realize that the suppression of the innumerable insect pests and con - the success of his crops depends to a large extent on the presence of the birds, and this fact alone should insure their protection. But laying aside for the present this practical, "dollar and cents"' view, and considering the birds in a purely aesthetic sense we still find abundant reason for their strenuous protection. They are among the most beautiful of nature's gifts to man. Brilliancy of plumage, beauty of form, grace of flight and sweet - ness of song all tend to make them the most attractive to us of all God's creatures. The rich flash of color emanating from some passing oriole or tanager, the aerial evolutions of the swal - lows wheeling about over head, or infinitely sweet and flutelike melody of the thrushes are but typical examples of the high degree of perfection these qualities attain in the avian life. Such features are generally conspicuous enough to force tli upon the notice of even the casual observer. Vet there are some people to whom even these are entirely lost, people who would not turn their head to follow the flight of a brightly colored songster. But to the student of bird life the beauti&lt; uani - fold and omnipresent. He can see beauty in the sparrow's simple coat and the most common actions of a bird are to him </seg>
            <seg id="p222">222 motions of beauty and exquisite grace; in the shrill cry of the hawk, the weird hooting of the owl or the hoarse "quok" of the heron, uncanny and disagreeable sounds to most persons, he can 8ee beauty because he understands the bird's nature as reflected in its note. What can be more impressive of loneliness and soli - tude than the sad cooing of the Mourning Dovei Or what is more pathetic than the pensive note of the Wood Pewee? What better suggests excited animation than the lively rattle of the Kingfisher? And what is more cheering than the first spring song of the Robin? We see the bird, its environment, its occu - pation, and through its note we experience its mood. The pleasure of nature's company would be greatly depreciat ed if the birds were wanting. Who would care to walk in the woods and not meet with a single flash of bright color or hear a sweet song . A woods without birds would be analogous to a garden without flowers. Yet it is to be feared that our country is and has been for years drifting rapidly in that direction. Many forces are at work toward the extermination of our birds and they are constantly exposed to great dangers both from natu ral forces and from man. It seems to us a cruel thing to see some happy songster just arrived in its northern home suddenl pounced upon, carried away and devoured by a skirmishing hawk or to see some pretty warbler imposed upon by a lazy cowbm by having its own dainty egg? thrown from the nest to mak room for those of the parasite. Even should any of the eggs of the rightful owner remain and hatch, every particle of food brought by the parent is deposited in the gaping mouth of the intruder, while its own offsprings are crowded under or entirely out of the nest and left to starve. Although we may turn from such scenes as repulsive to up, yet they cannot compare in cruelty to the deeds of man himself. They are merely part of nature's system of checks and balances, and there is a definate object to be accomplished in each. But the cruelty of man is blind and heartless, seeking for no worthy end and assuredly ac - complishing none. It is merely killing for killing's sake with no foresight for the future and no regret for the past. </seg>
            <seg id="p223">223 BIRD NOTES man's influence on birdlife. Occupying as lie does the most exalted position among all animal life, and gifted by the Deity with the allpowerful weapon of intelligence. Man without doubt is one of the most import - ant factors in the increase or destruction of all inferior forms of ife. At first driven to it by necessity, but latter continuing it &gt;ecause of a semi-savage desire to kill something, or as it is &gt;olitely called, a "love of sport," since prehistoric ages he has &gt;ent a large portion of his ingenuity toward the devising and &gt;erfecting of implements of destruction and our modern hammer - ess breech loader is one end of a series of more and more im - troved weapons evolving from the stone hatchet and flint pointed spear. And, of course, with this improvement in arms came a corresponding increase in efficiency, and consequently in exten - siveness of destruction. As long as this killing was governed &gt;y the demand for food alone and restricted to that demand by nefficient weapons, Man was only playing his rightful part in Nature's system of checks and balances. He sought to live, and to this end food was necessary, and in the primitive wander - ng condition the only accessible food was game. But as civili - zation increased and game decreased, as the migratory life was gradually replaced by a settled condition, and as the existence of mmanity came to depend on the tilling of the soil rather than the fruits of the chase, Man's right of place as a competent part of Nature's system ceased. And this condition prevailed long &gt;efore the discovery of this continent. But with the opening of this broad land to colonization, teemin as it was with a mighty abundance of all forms of animal life that barbarous desire to kill so long pent up because of lack o victims in Europe, here found an ideal field for gratification, am relieved of any restraining hand whatever, it was gratified in as we now see, and is being gratified today, as future generation shall realize.

One of the earliest, and probably the most conspicuous, in - tance of complete mercilessness of Man in destroying helpless reatures,if that destruction in any way satisfies his pecuniary greed, s that of the annihilation of the Great Auk. The northern shores of be Atlantic on both continents were the home of this peculiar bird, n the American aide ranging from Greenland to Virginia, 'his bird was about the size of a small goose, was of a blackish olor above and white below, with a white spot before the a bar on the wing of the same color and the sides of the nee &gt;rown. In its completely aquatic life it had long found no m sity for flight, and in accordance with Nature's unalterable law lisuse had caused its wings to degenerate until flight was an in )oesibilitv. Yet these small wings made an excellent pair o oars, and with the loss of flight came an increased adeptnc swimming and diving, so that in this respect the Great Auk hat no superior. Exactly as is the habit of many related birds, the Auk gatln n immense colonies during the breeding season, and at this tim the whole of the race in North America would gather on a few solated rocky islets off the Newfoundland coast, and clamberin slowly over the rocks would deposit their single egg on the bar earth until every foot of ground was thus utilized. When Cartie visited this coast in 1534 he.according to his own account, lande&lt; and filled two boats with them in a half hour, and 63 years late travelers wrote that "the birds set on the rocks as thick as stone on a paved street." 1 Passing ships made these islands a regula stopping point, and secured enormous numbers of the birds fo their flesh, feathers and oil. The local fishermen depended muc on them for food and bait, and their eggs were gathered by ship loads, thus depriving the poor birds of the only method of inci or resistance. Finally as a last straw a wholesale traffic for Au feathers sprang up and this sealed their fate. Men with club landed on the rocks and by smashing the skulls of the helple - birdsthey were slain by hundreds of thousands, their feathers secur ed, their bodies left to moulder where the bird was killed.

According to Audubon it nested in southern Labrador, on the rocky islets. It suddenly disappeared about 1870, the last authentic specimen being taken the following year. American writers have expressed difficulty in understanding the cause of this bird's extinction; but Mr. Newton says: "Like the Eider it bred on the islets where it was safe from foxes. But this safety was unavailing when man began to visit its breeding haunts and not content with plunder ing its nest to mercilessly shoot the birds. Most of the islet easily ransacked and depopulated. Having no asylum to turn to, and unlike its congeners having no high northern range, its fate is easily understood." Whether or not Mr. Newton is cor - rect in throwing the entire blame upon human agencies I do not know, but it it known that the conditions he speaks of were pre - sent, and his inference seems not unreasonable. Forty-two specimens of this bird are preserved in museums, those in tiie 5. Nat. Museum being collected by no less person than the famous Webster. INSTANCE8 OF PRACTICAL EXTINCTION. This is, in brief, the effect Man has had so far as total annihi - lation goes, and the nineteenth century can boast of having the c &lt;lisappearance of but two, or possibly three, North American birds, and these of such species that the world will prob - ably not miss them. But there is another state of existence, and that is when a bird, formerly abundant, has been perse&lt; -•ich an extent that it is brought to the very threshold oj tinction — when its individuals are so depleted in numbers that it is impossible to find one when so desired, and, if found at all, that in the wildest, most remote parts of their former range, and this is called pra . It is of our practically extinct bird list that the American people need to be heartily ashamed — a list of birds that the nineteenth century has seen broug! low in numbers that it will require but a decade or two of the twentieth to see them placed in the category with the Great Auk. Our grandparents can well recollect the great flocks of Passen- </seg>

Probably no other bird in the history of civilized man was ever so abundant as was this passenger pigeon, and the immensity of the flocks can scarcely be conceived in this day of bird persecution and scarcity. Audubon leaves records of flocks of imigrating pigeons so dense that the sun was obscured, and such flocks often consumed an entire day in pass - ing over, while the sound of their wings was as a mighty thunder. WilsoQ estimated a single flock seen in Kentucky to contain two billion birds. Owing to their eminently gregarious habit - pigeons resorted to vast colonies, or "roosts;" and during the nesting season the Great Lake region fairly swarmed with these birds. But such immense flocks proved an eyesore to the gameloving Americans. They immediately began to contrive methods of des - truction and found that netting about fitted their ideal. Pigeon netting became to many a regular business, and was pursued with a most extraordinary activity, and even as late as 1881 at least 500 men were engaged in netting pigeons in northern Michigan. On the average each man captured 20,000 birds in a season, lapping from a single roost in 1878 aggregated several mil - lions of birds. They were netted and trapped without ceasing, millions killed and thousands wounded, while the young squabs were starved in countless numbers. The markets became so overstocked that it was no longer profitable to ship the birds, so they were fed to the hogs. But not for a day did the netting , and in a few he inevitable resulted. The great flocks dwindled away, the ''roosts 1 ' became smaller and smaller until finally they were deserted. One roost that was original] so large that for three miles the ne; n thick that 500 might have I told on the beechtrees at. one time, in 1850 found the pig scarce,25 years later rare, and ten years more entirely gone.

An indirect, though none the less severe sufferer, lias been the California Vulture. This, our largest North American vulture used to occupy the territory between the Colorado and Columbia rivers west of the Sierra Nevadas, and followed up the Columbia 500 miles to feed on the dead salmon. While the bird was (and still is for that matter) killed at every possible opportunity, both for socalled "sport'' and by the Mexican miners for its quills, which they used as a receptacle for gold dust, this could never alone have brought it to its present rarity. The use of bait poisoned with strychnine, set out for wolves caught more vultures, and resulted in its almost complete extermination. Some few still exist in the remote southern portions of its range, but it is ex - tremely rare. Among the most severe sufferers from the bird destruction caused by the demands of fashion coupled with the greed of con - scienceless plume hunters have been the socalled "aign herons, or more exactly speaking, the Great White Heron, the American Egret and the Snowy Heron.

It occurs with varying frequency, and so far as known has ap - peared in epidemic form but once (1885). What we have on the Ash is the cluster cup stage of the fun - gus. The diseased leaves and stems are very much enlarged on both the upper and lower surfaces. The fruiting bodies grow out from these parts. They consist of round tube like affairs, orange colored at the end. The orange rust is not numerous enongh to cause much injury, it however steals food material from the tree and causes a growth, which is not beautiful to the eye. No remedy has yet been discovered. </seg>

You hare all noticed the brown and black growths n the end of young ash trees. They are usually considered a ungus growth but the fact is they are caused by tiny mites which nfest the soft tissue of the flower buds and the young twig, 'his is no disease and hence must be considered from the insect tandpoint. A bracket fungus which is very common in this vicinity is wlyporus hispidus. The brackets and fruiting bodies are soft and spongy with a rough brown upper surface and a yellowish under surface. They occur where the tree has suffered some mechanical injury or where frost cracks are present. I have noticed that several usually occur on the same tree. I ound eight trees upon which I counted twenty-five brackets. This is the same fungus which Mr. Williams has described as an enemy of the apple tree.) The brackets I have with me were ound on a row of Ash trees just across the road south of the State f arm . This fungus causes a brown discoloration or' the wood together with short white lines running in both vertical and radial directions giving to the wood the appearance of being marked out in squares. About half of the brackets on the eight trees appear to be two or three years old. This disease ib quite dangerous but no remedy has as yet been discovered. Dr. Herman Von Schrenk in charge of the Mississippi Valley Laboratory has made some thorough investigations of a fungus which is playing havoc with the White Ash in Missouri and East - ern Kansas. As the White Ash is found in the south-eastern part of this state, I have no doubt but what this disease known as white rot (Polypomis Fraxlnopltilus) is common to that par of the state. White rot grows in the heart wood of the trunk and branches and changes the hard wood of the ash to a soft pulpy yellowish mass. The diseased tree is readily recognized by the large colored fruiting bodies, which usually occur in considerable numbers at the ends of broken branches and other wounds.

            <seg id="p235">235 THE DISEASES OF THE ASH this fungus is rare, but west of the Mississippi River where it is at best a tree of medium size and development it is found on ninety per cent, of the standing trees. This disease does not directly effect the living parts of the tree, but in the long run it under mines it and it falls a victim to the winds. The fungus gains entrance through wounds or dead branches. The mycelium changes the light colored wood of the healthy ash first to light brown and later to dark ground and when the disintegration is complete the rotted wood is again straw colored, very soft and readily absorbs water, a cross section of the fruiting body is nearly triangular, very hard and woody and has a brown or rust color This fungus has also been found on the green ash in Kansas and it will without a doubt be common in Nebraska in a few years, if the disease has once entered the tree it cannot be eradicated but careful pruning and a coating of tar over all large wounds will greatly reduce the chance of contracting it. Another fungus which causes the soft rot is Polyporus versi - color. It is frequently found on dead wood and spreads by means of spores. The fruiting brackets grow many together,one above the other. The upper surface,soft and decorated by bands of several colors. When young they are fleshy, but as they grow older they become tough and somewhat brittle and the front edge curls in. The disease first manifests itself in the center of the effected tree. The color of the wood changes to light brown then to dark brown, and when the decomposition is completed it is a little lighter than the healthy wood, but soft enough for ones finger nail to make considerable impression. Since it works from the inside outward a tree may be badly ef - fected and still have the appearance of a healthy tree. Not much can be done to save the trees affected, because it is hard to detect the disease in its early stages, but many of the trees can be used for fence posts, and will last nearly as long as healthy posts. The only toad stool fungus which I found on the ash is an un - determined species of agaricus. This I found on a wound of the </seg>
            <seg id="p236">236 NEBRASKA 8TATK HORTICCLTUEAL 8OCIETY green ash which had to be cut last July. It has a comparative bodied roundish brown fruiting part. I do not know what affect the mycelium has upon the wood as the fungus had not made enough headway to enable me to ascertain this fact. It is not out of place here to say a word concerning the eti which insects have upon the ash, and its relation to disease. Most of the Ash trees are infested with Vorers, over four-fifths of the here in Lincoln are literally riddled with holes and n&lt; very many are diseased. This shows that the Ash is quite a hardy tree. At Wiener along the Elkhorn Valley where I live over one-half of the trees have been worked by Vorers, but I could not find a single fungus. This is another fact indicating the hard f the tree. The wounds made by the vorers af - forded a good lighting place for the fungus spores, and al&gt; duce the vitality of the tree, but I think that very few, if die directly from injuries affected by the Vorer. A fun. erall\ along and finishes the work. To reduce the c! of disease to a minimum all large wounds should be covered with tting of paint or gas tar. The diseased trees should b&lt; out immediately. This will prevent spreading and also give the owner tire-wood or fence posts. I will be very glad to re specimens of diseased ash timber and if any of you come ■ any good material it will reach me, if you send it in care of the Botany Department. </seg>
