            <seg id="p004">4 TWENTY-NINTH ANNUAL REPORT DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND COMMERCE Bureau of Banking Lincoln, December 30, 1922. Hon. S. R. McKelvie, Governor, Sir: Herewith we submit for your information statistics and comparisons of the Nine Hundred Sixty-three State Banks reporting to this Depart - ment as of September 30, 1922. Since this abstract was' completed four of the reporting banks have failed, leaving Nine Hundred Fifty-nine in operation as of this date. The boom and promotion period following the War, and this period succeeded in turn by three years of deflation, 1920, 1921 and 1922, has had a very disastrous effect upon the State Banks and their agricultural and stock-growing patrons, and resulted in twenty-five State Bank failures in 1921 and twenty-two in 1922. The Department wishes to express to you its sincere acknowledge - ment of the consideration, confidence and co-operation which you have shown at all times and under all circumstances, and the valuable advice and assistance of the Attorney General's office. We are also deeply indebted to the examiners and our Department assistants for whatever measure of success has been accomplished. Very respectfully submitted, J. E. HART, Secretary. Department of Trade and Commerce. </seg>
