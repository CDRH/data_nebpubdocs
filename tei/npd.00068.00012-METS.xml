            <seg id="p004">4 A sewage disposal system was built at the Norfolk State Hospital at an approximate cost of $8,000.00, while at the Hastings State Hospital a new generating system was installed at a cost of $46,000.00. We feel grateful to the legislature for the appropriations which made it possible to make these much needed improvements. There is an outstanding crowded condition still prevailing, m many of our institutions, and this can only he overcome by appropriations to meet this emergency. In the tables which follow will be shown the population of the various institutions, together with the expenditures made for the maintenance of the same. In these tables it must be home m mind that the items of salaries and wagesare included under maintenance m all instances excepting that of the Hoard itself. Capital outlay represents permanent improvements to the realty and. equipment. Details of operation of the farm land owned by the state are also given m the several reports of the superintendents, and we trust will be read with interest. We extend our sincere thanks to the officers and employees of the various institutions m their efforts to bring about a better con - dition for those who have been committed to their care. We also wish to thank Governor McMullen for his many manifestations, of interest and cooperation m our work. Board of Control, CARRTE A. BIkSS. Chairman. E. T. WESTERVELT, H. S. THORPE. </seg>

            <seg id="p017">To the Governor and the P.oard of Control of State Institutions, Lincoln, Nebraska. I herewith submit the Twenty-second Biennial Report of the Institution for Feeble-Minded for the period ending June 30th, 1929. The Nebraska Institution for Feeble-Minded was opened on May 25th, 1887, and three inmates are here who came at that time. We have six inmates who have been here forty years and thirty-six who have been here more than thirty years. The total number of inmates admitted to this date, June 30, 1929, is 2535. The highest number present during the biennium was 877 and the number present June 30th was 834. This number does not correctly represent our true population as our school closes at the end of May and many children go home for a visit. There, has been an insistent demand for the admission of Feeble- Minded Children to this Institution and we have accepted everyone possible to accommodate and have at this time One Hundred Twenty-Seven applications on file. Owing to the crowded con - dition of the Institution and the insistent demand for admission, we recommended m our Annual Report an appropriation of $125,OOO.(X) to build and equip a custodial building for males The Governor included this appropriation his budget rec - ommendation to the Legislature. After a visit of the Legislative Committee to the various Institutions, the Legislature saw fit to in - crease this appropriation to $1 50,(XK).00. vVe estimate that for $125,OOO.(X) we can erect a building that will accommodate two hundred inmates and for the extra $25,000.00 we could have seventy more inmates. f have a preliminary plan for this building and when the proper time 'comes our architect will work out detailed plans and specifications. This plan will provide a building absolutely fire proof, sanitary. and convenient, with adequate provision for clothes rooms and storage space, a thing which is sometimes overlooked m 17 </seg>
            <seg id="p018">planning Institution buildings. A. large dining room and the nec - essary kitchen arrangements will take care of all the patients m this building. On the third lloor will be made room for employees. At the present time we are crowded for room for employees. To this building will be transferred the inmates now at the . Stone Cottage. This will give us the Stone Cottage for Infirmary cases and will make it possible for us to accept seventy-five girls. At the present time, we are unable to accept a female of any type. The Members of the P&gt;oard have kept m close touch with the Institution and are familiar with all. of its activities so 1 will omit details and will only give a brief summary of our accomplishments during the past biennium and our aims for the coming two years, which with the assistance and advice of the Board, we hope to accomplish. Particularly do I call attention to that part which deals with the regeneration of our power plant and the development of our new farm. The question of an adequate water supply for this Institution has been a problem for many years. New wells have been made from time to time but these gradually fail and others must be made. This along with the fact that our population is constantly increasing, makes it necessary for us to be constantly on the lookout for water. During the first year of the biennium, we made a test well a quarter of a mile west of our buildings where we found about fifteen feet of water at a depth of seventy-five feet. Three wells were completed at this place, pumps and motors installed and a six inch water main laid to a reservoir near the stand pipe. From it the water is pumped into the stand pipe. With this addition we were able to provide enough water for our needs, but on account of the failure of a large well at the old location, it became necessary to make another well at this west location. This well has now been completed and will be connected up at once. However, we did not feel that we had enough water for fire protection so we made application to the State Department of Irrigation for a permit to place a dam m Bear Creek on our own land to draw water therefrom for the purpose of fire protection and irrigation. This dam has now been completed and a large volume of water is now available for our use. After considerable search and wSth the assistance of some of 18 </seg>
            <seg id="p019">our inmates who have been here a great many years, we discovered a large reservoir one hunderd feet long, six feet wide and eight feet deep, running parallel with the creek. This reservoir had been built, bricked up and arched over more than thirty years ago, but we found it m an excellent state of preservation and we are now placing a motor driven centrifugal pump at this reservoir and will pump water to a large reservoir at the boiler house from which point a large steam pump will be used to force water through a four inch pipe which will extend from the boiler house along our main Institution street as far as the band stand. At convenient points along this Hue, pipe connections will be placed to attach our fire hose m case of fire. This water will also be used to irrigate our lawns and garden and it is also possible that arrangements may be made to use this water for the laundry and boilers. The addition to our power plant building is very badly needed and was provided for m the appropriation for repairs and replace - ments. This will house our hot water heater, the boiler feed tank and boiler leed pumps and vacuum pump. Also our shop and truck storage as well as room for future developments which are contem - plated. The old portion which will be torn down is actually unsafe. It is thought that the one story part of this old building on the south west may be used for our ice plant and cold storage as the ice plant we have is inadequate for our present needs and will be absolutely so when we add two hundred or more to our population. Some tunnels will have to be rebuilt, but the matter of an up - to-date tunnel system for this Institution will have to wait till another biennium. We will need a large vegetable storage cave but as our potato crop does not promise to be a very large one, we may find it possible to let this cave wait till the second year of the biennium. As stated m my annual report our greenhouse is falling down and must be replaced very soon so that our gardener can get his things m for the winter; Both the dairy barn and the hay barn for dairy cows are too small and additions must be made as soon as possible. I would recommend that a ten stall garage for employees cars be made as soon as possible. This can be done by our own labor 19 </seg>
            <seg id="p020">and at no great expense. At the present timej many of our employees keep their cars m various out-of-the-way places and some of them are actually compelled to leave them out exposed to the weather Our school continues to be one of the leading activities of our Institution. Two hundred boys and girls attend the classes, five days , a week for nine months m the year. Our work includes everything from the kindergarten up to arid including the fifth grade, but it may properly be said that all of our children are m school. Low grades are taught to attend to their physical wants. Medium grades are taught to care for their less fortunate brothers. The higher grades are all employed m some useful occupation. Our constant aim is to give every boy and every girl the highest type of job that he or she is capable of doing. We have had no trouble m securing and keeping capable help. There have been no changes m heads of departments and we are deeply grateful to those m responsible positions for their earnest and loyal cooperation m conducting the affairs of the Institution, and finally I wish to thank the Members of the Board for their wise counsel and valuable cooperation as well as for their patience and consideration. &gt; Yours respectfully, DR. J. A. BURFORD, Superintendent. 20 </seg>

            <seg id="p033">To the Governor and the Board of Control of State Institutions, Lincoln, Nebraska. The following report and statistical tables comprise the eighteenth biennial report of the Girls' Training School located at Geneva, Nebraska. This report embraces the period beginning July 1, 1927, and closing June 30, 1929. The number of girls under instruction on July 1, 1927, was 217. Since that date we have received 120 girls and two have been re - turned because they failed to make good. The morale of the school has never been better than at the present time ,and we believe that this is largely due to the relief of our crowded condition. I f an education is essential to the success of the girl from a good home, with the care and protection of good parents, it is certainly doubly so for the unfortunate girl. . A large per cent of the girls come from broken homes or homes that failed to stimulate a desire for an education and the finer things of life. As soon as a girl enters the school we have a talk with her and learn just what schooling she •lias had, and what her ambitions are .along educational lines, Many of the girls who come to the school are not particularly interested m any line of work either academic or industrial. But with proper SUperyision and encouragement they soon become inter - ested and enthusiastic over their work. It has taken some time to get our work up to the present standard. But each year or biennium we have made special ■ effort to make some defmate advancement m our academic work. I Last biennium we added the ninth anil tenth grades, and this year we added the eleventh and twelfth grade work. With the co-operation of Supt. DeVoe of the Geneva School arid the Geneva school board we were able to graduate four of our girls from the twelfth grade. One of these girls is now m summer 1 school and doing very creditable work. Next year we hope to have several more finish their high school work. There were twenty girls who passed the county eighth grade 33 </seg>
            <seg id="p034">examination and one of our 14 year old girls stood the highest m the county. Our teachers have the same qualifications that are required to teach m the public schools. The hours of work and the time given to each period are the same as m the public school. The - books are all selected carefully so that the girls have the best I possible chance to do good work. The music department is also under the supervision of an ac- f' credited teacher, who devotes her entire time to the music. As I soon as a girl enters the school she is given a test as to her musical 1 ability, and if she has talent she is given special work along this I line. All girls are given group work. There is a nice orchestra and I two glee clubs. Once each week the girls are all brought together fj and one hour is spent m singing. Nothing has a better effect on the* girls than music, and there is nothing that they enjoy more thanttl singing. It is unfortunate that we are obliged to keep under our care girls X whose mentality is such that the training is without definite value to them, and who are a needless burden on the teachers, and a hinderance to other girls, who are able to profit by the training. Aside from the school work all girls are given instruction m sewing, domestic art, laundry, housekeeping, cooking, serving, and canning. There are also classes m gardening, dairy work and poultry raising. Our gardens furnish an abundance of fresh vegetables for table use during the summer, and usually enough potatoes, turnips, beets, onions and carrots to last until spring. We have not purchased a can of corn or beans for several years and last year canned all the tomatoes that we used. There is now left m our store room over. 5000 cans of fruit and vegetables. I The school has a good herd of Holstein cows which the girls j milk and care for. I A number of times during the past two years | their cows stood at the head of the Blue Valley Better Dairy jj Association, and they won a medal and certificate given by the | association last year. They have been very much interested m this | work and very proud of the record their cows have made. We have not been so successful m the poultry department as I we have not been able to secure a competent woman to supervise! this work. : ' Each evening a short devotional exercise is held m the Families.! Sunday morning the International Sunday School lesson is taught. | 34 </seg>
            <seg id="p035">The ministers from the different churches m Geneva hold services on Sunday afternoon. At seven m the evening Christian Endeavor meetings conducted by the girls, under the supervision of their manager, is held m the Family living room. No girl is compelled to attend any of these meetings but they are all made so interesting that it is very seldom that a girl asks to remain away from them. Regular time and regular recreation is provide:! for the girls, consisting of parties, out door sports, dramatics and picture shows. We do not have a show at the school but they are taken down to Geneva to the shows, which they enjoy more because it is away from the school. • The one improvement which we needed most, a cottage for girls, and vvhichu^ had hoped to have m operation long before this is still m the making. This is due to the fact that the legislature di.l not appropriate money enough for the building and we hail to get an additional appropriation before we could begin work on the building. During this biennium an ice machine and cooling plant has been installed. A well for irrigating the gardens and lawns has been put down and equipped with an electrical pump. So far this season it lias not been necessary for us to use it as we have had plenty of rainfall. Some walks have been laid, painting arid repair - ing of walls and ceilings, and a number of much needed repairs made m the healing system. If success has been attained by the present management of the Training School much, of it is due to the wholesome advice and loyal support which we have received at all times at the hands of the Hoard of Control. Our burdens have been greatly lightened and our work made much more agreeable and successful by the hearty co-operation and confidence so generously expressed by the people of Geneva and Fillmbre County. We have also been very fortunate m having some excellent co-workers who have done everything they could for the advance - ment of the school and the betterment of the girls. To all of you I want to extend my most sincere appreciation. Yours respectfully, LENA E. WARD, Superintendent. 35 </seg>

            <seg id="p043">To the Governor and the Board of Control of State Institutions, Lincoln, Nebraska. We -herewith submit the twenty-first biennial report of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Home at Grand Island, Nebraska. We note that during the two years covered by the report, the male membership has declined 26, and the female membership has declined 4. This is due to the increasing age and feebleness of the Civil War veterans. There have been Several important additions to the institution equipment during the biennium. The South Wing which was added to the new hospital is a valuable improvement to the building. It is much handier for the wards. The new furniture has added to the improvement. The new store building was much needed, and is appreciated especially by the employees who have their rooms on the second story. The repairs on the interior of the chapel make it a more comfortable and cheerful meeting place for members and employees of the Home. We wish to express to the Governor and the Hoard of Control our gratitude for. their co-operation m all matters pertaining to the management of the Home. Respectfully submitted, j: J.

            <seg id="p061">To the Governor and the Board of Control of State Institutions, Lincoln, Nebraska. The management of the Hastings State Hospital submits, here - with, the Biennial Report for the period ending June 30, 1929. This report covers the activities of. every department of the hospital-. In it are noted all of the changes m the personnel, as well as the shifts m the patient population. This period opened with a patient population of thirteen hundred and fifty-seven and closed with fourteen hundred and forty-five. The hospital is crowded to capacity and there are only enough vacancies on the wards for emergency cases. Owing to a shortage of funds, the new Hospital and Receiving Building which was built from the appropriation of the 1925 Legislature stayed idle. This, as originally planned; had a capacity of approximately one hundred patients. During the last year of this biennium, a large wing of the main building was found unsafe for use and the patients were ordered out. The new building was then pressed into serivee as a custodial building and will be use 1 as. such until the repair work on the wing of the old building is completed ; then we hope to use the building as originally planned. The appropriations to cover general repairs for the past six years have been inadequate to keep' the physicial plant of the hospital m first class condition. Needed repairs and replacements have been delayed on account of lack of funds, until it is now. imperative to take care of this" work m spite of the fact that our General Repair Fund for the next biennium seems insufficient. The general health of the patient population has been excellent. Our medical staff has made a consistent effort to improve the medical work, both m general medicine and m psychiatry. Both the mental and physical conditions of our patients are carefully examined and treated as extensively as the time of our physicians permits. 61 </seg>
            <seg id="p062">The garden and farm and their departments have had good years. A detailed account of the produce is found later on m the report. Owing to the hot, dry weather, it has been necessary to ir - rigate the garden during the months of July and August m order to save it. In closing this report I wish to acknowledge the loyal service given by the staff, officers, and the employees, m caring for the unfortunate citizens of our State who have become mentally ill. I also wish to thank the Governor, and each member of the Board of Control for their kindly advice and co-operation extended during the past biennium. Respectfully submitted, J.

            <seg id="p074">To the Governor and the Board of Control of State Institutions. Lincoln, Nebraska. I hereby have the honor of submitting the Twenty-ninth Bien - nial Report of the Lincoln State Hospital, for the period covering twenty- four months, from July 1, 1927, to June 30, 1929. The medical staff remains as it was two years ago, with the exception of Dr. W. E. Dickinson, who resigned on November 17, 1928, to go into other fields and Dr. A. R. I lornbcck was appointed by the Board to take his place. The members of the staff have manifested a keen interest m their work and efforts directed to the restoration of patients through modern treatment have been quite vigorous. Our dentist, Dr. William I. Rot ton, is still with us and treats and extracts teeth of our patients where necessary, which has been a great benefit to all of them, as many patients come to us with teeth conditions very bad, and many develop teeth troubles while with us. Religious services are held each Sunday afternoon at two-thirty. Dr. Thomas A. Maxwell, our chaplain, conducts the services and the hour of chapel service is most profitable. Amusements have been carried on as usual during this period. On Tuesday evenings the moving picture show is given ; each Friday night a patients' dance ; and occasional entertainment is secured out - side of these, by the University Players, etc. On Holidays we have some sort of entertainment, usually music and extra, dinners. During Christmas time any of our patients receive packages of eatables and presents, and the Hospital takes on a holiday air. It seems to have a good effect on the patients. In addition to this we have installed on twelve different wards telephone radios or loud speakers and these have been a very great source of amusement, entertainment and joy to our patients and we feel that it is one of the best things that we have undertaken to quiet the disturbed mind and spread influence throughout the institution because those patients who are most able to enjoy it do so and tell the other patients concerning what they have heard. 74 </seg>
            <seg id="p075">Hence, it makes them feel as though they are not shut-ins but living m .the world at large. ■The-, farm and garden during the past two years have been very productive. An abundance of various crops and potatoes has beep produced. . The sewing room and the various domestic duties about the Institution provide occupational pursuits for our female patients. The carpenter shop, shoe repair, mattress shop, furniture repair, tapji, garjlen, engine room, laundry, chicken house, dairy, green - house and lawn provide occupational pursuits for our male patients. The sewing room performs a most useful function m the manu - facture of clothing and bedding for the Institution. Patients are happier' and m many instances actually improve mentally by reason of having, certain tasks to perform. We regard industrial pursuits as one of our most potent therapeutic agents. :.• We have been able, as our tables will show, to send a great many • patients home, either thoroughly recovered or at least so that they can remain m their home environment for some time and this has been due, of course, to the surroundings, the treatment and the entertainment which enters into and is a part of the treatment of mental diseases. We were allowed by the last Legislature a wing for the Hospital which we hope to construct the second year of this new Biennium. The room is needed very badly and it is too bad that we could not have had both wings at this time because before another Legislature can meet and we are able to receive an ap - propriation we are going to be very crowded for room. 1 wish to thank His Excellency, the Governor, and the Honor - able Members of the Hoard of Control, for their courteous con - sideration ; for the confidence, the kind assistance and advice they have uniformly extended to me throughout the year and also the officers and employees associated with me, who have been loyal and faithful during the Biennium. Very respectfully submitted, / D. G. GRIFFITHS, Superintendent. 75 </seg>

            <seg id="p090">90 To the Governor and the Board of Control of State Institutions, Lincoln, Nebraska. I have the honor of. presenting herewith the Twentieth Biennial Report of the Norfolk State Hospital, which covers a period from July 1, 1927, to June 30, 1029. Again it is a privilege to record the general good health of our entire household. We have had no serious illness. While our wards have been crowded far beyond their normal capacity; at times causing even discomfort and much irritability, particularly among our disturbed classes of patients, we have been fortunate also m escaping serious accident. That we have been so favored, we feel is largely due to the number of men and women engag-1 every day m the various activities of the Hospital. Those whose condition of health does not permit of engaging m any industry, have spent much of their time out of doors. In tms way our crowded conditions have been overcome during the day, and at night the wards have been quiet, following the day's work and the time spent m the open air. These measures have contributed m no small way to the improved conditions of health of the patients, m making them more contented and happier with their lot m life. • In so far as possible, the established rule m engaging a patient m some suitable,, as well as congenial employment, has been con - tinued, as it is well known out door life offers a greater inducement and above all others, the one best suited for the greater majority of our patients, and therefore some occupation upon the farm, m the garden, or caring for the greenhouse, is easily sought and much enjoyed by many of our patients, resulting not only m their restorer tion to health, but also the improved condition of those who aie compelled to remain with us. We continue to try and make the wards attractive and home - like, and have provided with reading material, such as daily papers, home papers, illustrated magazines, and books from our library. In this connection, we pause to give credit to the Library Com - </seg>
            <seg id="p091">mission of our state for the wonderful selection of books and magazines that they supply to our Institution. A greenhouse furnishes an abundance of plants and flowers for decorating the sick rooms, some of the da)' halls, and dining rooms. Religious services arc now held m our new chapel building. Also m. tli is building two picture shows a week are had, with the exception of the summer months. The religious services are attended by &lt;'i goodly number of the patients and are enjoyed. The picture shows have a very large attendance, and are probably more universally appreciated and enjoyed than any one thing m the way of amusement that we have, though too much cannot be said of the enjoyment patients receive from our radio. The exercise of good business judgment and economy has marked the administration of the Steward's Department. This Department lias developed one of the finest Holstcin herds m the state of Nebraska. In this regard, I would like to say a word of appreciation of the College of Agriculture, Department of Dairy Husbandry, for the interest manifested m our dairy herd and the wise counsel and cp-.opera.tion. The yield of farm and garden products during the past two years is quite up to average, with the exception of one or two of our crops. We have had a hard time, due to lack of rain at the proper time, m getting new alfalfa fields started. Other than alfalfa- and a few garden products, our crops were about all that could be asked. The engine room and oilier mechanical departments have been conducted m a very satisfactory manner. Our Engineer, m his report to me, states that m his opinion, the most important improve - ment we have had made this 1 Hiennium is the new sewer system. The Legislature provided for. some engine room equipment for the coming Biennium; We expect to buy a new 3()0 H. P. engine and a 2(X) K. W. generator, also a new well and pump. There is an ever increasing demand for electric light power and water, and the equipment that we have m mind to purchase will take care of our needs for some- little time. Many of our buildings are m need of paint and other repairs, but due to lack of funds, had to be postponed. However, with the 91 </seg>
            <seg id="p092">amount of money allowed for repairs, we expect to do considerable; work m this department the next year. In conclusion I desire to express my indebtedness to the assistant officers and all employees without whose cordial co - operation, our efforts would have been m vain, and to the members of the Board of Control I am also grateful for their continued advice and valued support. Respectfully submitted, g" c. charlton, Superintendent. ' . 92 </seg>

            <seg id="p102">To the Governor and the Board of Control of State Institutions, Lincoln, Nebraska. ■■■.'. We submit herewith the Seventh Biennial Report of the Board of Examiners of Defectives, covering the period beginning July 1, 1927, and ending June 30, 1929. This Board was created and appointed by the Board of Commissioners of State Institutions, complying with Chapter 237, Laws of Nebraska, 1915, entitled "An Act to authorize the sterilization of feeble-minded and insane inmates of State Institutions, m certain cases, and to provide for the appointment of a commission, and to define their powers and duties m connection therewith." There have been several meetings of the Board of Examiners of Defectives held during the past two years. Meetings are called by the chairman on request, of the superintendents of the, different state hospitals. Appended to this report will be found four tables : Table 1, referring to the Nebraska Institution for Feeble-minded: Table 2, Lincoln State Hospital; Table 3, Hastings State 'Hospital ; and Table 4, Norfolk State Hospital. There, was a total of 127 patients examined m four state institutions. The institutions were given authority to sterilize 64 patients before parole or discharge be granted. Section 1 of the law governing this Board reads as follows: "Sterilization of feeble-minded or insane inmates of state Institu - tions. Hereafter, no feeble-minded or insane inmate, physically capable of bearing or begetting offspring, shall be paroled or discharged from the instiution for the feeble-minded, or the hospital for the insane, nor paroled from the penitentiary, reforma - tory, industrial home, industrial schools or other such state institutions, except as hereinafter provided, or by order of a court of competent jurisdiction." . 102 </seg>
            <seg id="p103">The Board has adopted and followed a conservative policy m dealing with applicants for sterilization. No controversies have been invited nor entered into, perjudices m most cases have been overcome and religious scruples have always been respected. No patients have been sterilized without full consent of the relatives and the consent of the patient himself. Authority to sterilize has not been given m any case until after careful consideration of the personal and family history of the patient, and the Board convinced that the patient was capable of bearing or begetting offsprings, and that the offsprings "would inherit a tendency to feeble-mindedness, insanity, or degeneracy, and that such children would probably become a social menace and that procreation by such inmate woul 1 be harmful to society." In every case operated upon, recovery was prompt and complete. Respectfully submitted, D. G. GRIFFITHS, Chairman, G. E. CHARLTON, Secretary, J. A. BURFORD, J. H. MATTHAI, J. B. BABCOCK. 103 </seg>

            <seg id="p109">To the Governor and the Board of Control of State Institutions, Lincoln, Nebraska. The Twenty- fourth Biennial Report of the State Industrial School for the period ending June 30, 1929, is herewith respectfully submitted. The Schools of the Institution provide instruction from the first to tenth grades inclusive. The course of instruction follows the outlines provided by the State Superintendent of Public Instruc - tion. In addition we have a commerical department m which book - keeping, business arithmetic and typewriting are taught. Each boy is not only urged but compelled to attend school five half days of each week, devoting the other half day to work m the trades or about the institution, its farm or its gardens. The trades practiced are carpentering, cooking, baking, broom - making, tailoring, shoemaking, printing', painting, mechanics and laundering. By the practice of careful supervision on the part of the Institution workers it is hoped to guide, direct and change the habits of boys that they shall improve and approach good citizenship and manhood. An excellent farm of 372 tillable acres, three teams of mules and seven teams of horses, form the basis for the work m agri - culture which work id so helpful to many boys m this school. These boys must be impressed with the resources of rural life and the advantages of out-door life. Coming from congested districts, as many of them do, let us hope they will m advanced life, move to the great open Spaces) to the duties of invigorating country life. Medical authority has comlimented the cleanliness of the institution. Simplicity and neatness are desired by those workers who pride themselves on the appearance of the State's property. The merit system as authorized by the State Board of Control markedly aids m the maintenance of discipline m the school. Each boy is required to earn 18,000 credits. He then may be paroled to 109 </seg>
            <seg id="p110">a responsible and worthy man or woman. The better! his conduct, the more thorough his work, the more earnest m his study, the more quickly he gains his merits which entitle him to parole. By this system each boy determines to a great degree the length of time he shall spend m the school. His desire for liberty and the association of loved ones at home urge him to good behavior and work. Some boys earn paroles m nine months, others require eighteen months. Honesty is en - couraged by giving each boy 3000 extra merits for twelve months of honesty. This merit system I helps materially to secure good deport - ment throughout the school.' Conscientious workers m a school of this nature a "c ever mind - ful of the moral training due the boys. Endeavor is made to en - courage pure living. Sunday school is had each Sabbath day m each company, and all the boys attend chapel each Sunday afternoon at 2:30. Ministers address the boys urging them to live Christian lives. Among the physical improvements offered by this institution,, three are proudly outstanding: the complete tunnel system, the modern hospital, arid the large gymnasium. During the last twenty- four months many needed improve - ments have been made, namely : '■' One five hundred capacity poultry house. Ice box built for boys kitchen. Five buildings re-roofed. Asphalt floors m barn. New apple orchard of four hundred trees. Seventy-five shade trees placed. Installation of broom-making department. Two new Kewanee boilers installed, also stokers. Cold storage room for officers kitchen. South wall of boiler room rebuilt. Built eighteen A hog houses. Wagon scales rebuilt. Remodeled interior electric wiring. Telegraph system installed. New barn piped lor water, wired for light. Conduit wiring m boiler house. Ammonia pipe lines renewed m ice making plant. 110 </seg>
            <seg id="p111">Very much do I thank faithful, conscientious co-workers, citizens of Nebraska, judges and officers, who have encouraged and aided m this great work with boys. Honorable members of the Board of Control, heartily do I thank you for aid, counsel, encouragement and many kindnesses. Sincerely yours, R. V. CLARK, Superintendent. 111 </seg>

            <seg id="p121">To the Governor and the Board of Control of State Institutions, Lincoln, Nebraska. I herewith submit the Eighth. Biennial Report of the Hospital for Tuberculous covering the period from July 1, 1927, to June 30,1929. Our beds have been filled during most of the period, and m the past eighteen months we have had more applications for women than we could handle. We are pleased to know that the legislature made provision for a $60,000 addition to the Women's Building. We hava made an effort constantly through this period to keep the Hospital functioning at the highest possible point of efficiency and we feel that our efforts have not been m vain. The regular routine treatment has been carried out. Our general results compare favorably with other periods, but we still receive entirely too many far advanced cases. However, from what we can learn, this is no different than conditions existing m other states. We have made every effort to keep up our repairs ; m fact, have laid special stress on this matter. Some of the larger things that have been accomplished m the last year are : the boys' bathroom at the Pavilion was worked over ; a chicken house 20x40 was built ; an incinerator installed at the Men's Building; the refrigeration plant was repaired ; and the Crescent dishwasher overhauled and put m use. All of the buildings have had at least one coat of paint out - side, and most of the interior of all buildings has been painted. Water has been run to the hog house. Three hundred boxes to handle and store potatoes and vegetables have been made. We have done considerable repairing at the Stone Building and are working there at present. The windows and porches at the Stone Building have received attention and the third floor is having a pretty general overhauling. A garage has been built under the 121 </seg>
            <seg id="p122">portecochere. An Acme overhead system has been installed for our X-ray. Stokers have been installed under both boilers and a work - room added to the boiler house. The heating system at the Nurses- Cottage \n being made into a complete two pipe system. , We have been raising more chickens than m former years and at the present time have about 800. We have continued to raise a large.garden, as this provides an abundance of fresh vegetables during part of the year. We have with considerable difficulty kept our Ford truck m running condition and a new truck should be purchased very shortly. There are a number of other needs still existent that have been presented. During the past year we have had more boys and girls than previously, and our results are proving very satisfactory. Most of these cases are leaving us m very good physical condition. We have laid a little more stress during the past year on amusements for the patients, and during the winter and spring, have had moving picture shows a number of times. The Industrial School Band is giving us weekly concerts Friday afternoons during the warmer months. These are very much appreciated by our patients and we owe the Industrial School a vote of thanks for their services. One hundred new books .have recently been added to the patients' library by the Library Commission. Employees as a whole have continued loyal and efficient, and it is to this that much of the success of any business is due. 1 wish at this time to express my appreciation to those who have helped make the Institution a success. Allow me to thank the Hoard for the splendid co-operatjon and consideration shown this Institution during the past two years. Respectfully submitted, L. T. SI DWELL, Superintendent. 122 </seg>

            <seg id="p133">To the Governor and the Roanl of Control of State Institutions, Lincoln, Nebraska. The Twelfth Biennial Report covering the operation of the Orthopedic Hospital for the period ending June 30, 1929, is here - with respectfully submitted. The purpose of the Orthopedic Hospital is that of correction of twisted little bodies m children, prevention of deformities, and stands as an advisor to the Medical and Surgical Professions of our State. Those are admitted whose parents or caretakers are unable to stand the financial burden of prolonged private treatment. Application for admission, examination and possible treatment is made to the superintendent of the hospital direct. No charge is made for the hospital service nor for the medical or surgical procedure, if such is indicated after careful observation and examination of the patient. However, parents or caretakers are required to supply adequate clothing and meet the expenses of mechanical appliances if these are indicated. The patients while under treatment m the Orthopedic Hospital are given the advantage of continuing their school work and classes are conducted each day m all grades up to and including the eighth. The teachers are all registered and duly accredited with both the County and City Roards of Education. On completion of the eighth grade, the pupil is permitted to take the examinations of the county for admission to the High School. It is pleasing to state that m the past year we had six pupils that, while being treated, finished their work and passed the High School requirements by examination. The Orthopedic Training School for Nurses is under the direct supervision of the Superintendent of the hospital. A Superinten - dent of Nurses has charge of the student body, administering to its needs and aiding whenever necessary. Through her, the student body is directed and classes held throughout the school year. Only student! nurses of high moral character are acceptable and the work is so directed that all receive individual attention and get the most out of the work. 133 </seg>
            <seg id="p134">The requirements are the same as maintained by all Class A schools, two years of High School or its equivalent being necessary for admission. A period of probation is held and each student qualifying at the end of this period is given her cap and joins the regular student body as a junior student nurse. The teaching staff consists of active practicing specialists m their respective lines, and an instructress of nurses, thus assuring the student all that is new and up to the minute. Twelve months are taken at an affiliating hospital where general work is given. This hospital is one of the largest m the country and affords a rounding out of the student. The Orthopedic Hospital is the only institution of its kind m the state. This hospital is an actual hospital and m no sense is it custodial. Every resident is receiving active treatment and as soon as a resident has received all that can be done to aid him he is dis - charged or paroled and then is considered an "out-patient," these I "out patients" visiting the clinic every thirty days or oftc-ner for observation and advice. This hopsital is a rehabilitation work shop. so to speak, where broken and twisted little bodies are brought back to normal. The out patient service has greatly increased am every day letters are received asking for advice, and the medical profession throughout the state has come to refer to us for help and advice m cases beyond their individual control. . ■ The hospital while its name would bring one to believe that it is a specialty hospital yet the needs of the. cripples are such that actual orthopedic surgery forms but a part of the actual work of rehabilitation. Children are received m wretched physical states and often need general surgery to bring them to the point where the special work of correction can be attempted. It' is not un - common to have a patient m the hospital for weeks undergoing physical upbuild, thus preparing him for the surgery necessary to bring about a happy result. • I ll -- •'■ . I All branches of surgery and medicine are practiced, and we have large clinics m Pediatrics, General Surgery, Infant. Feeding, an j: occasional obstetric case, and all the allied branches of the | profession. Fresh air, sunshine, good food, and prompt and skillful medical I 134 </seg>
            <seg id="p135">and surgical attention are the foundation upon which this hospital functions. To the employees and officers who have been with the institu - tion over, the past period and man)' of them longer, I wish to herein express my appreciation and thanks for their loyalty atvl help m making the period a smooth road, so to speak. Without their co-operation and help the position would have been most difficult and any results I that have been commendable have been largely due to their tireless service and co-operation. This report would be decidedly incomplete without mention of those individuals and groups of individuals who have helped us carry the problem of amusement for the patients. Many clubs, societies, business firms, as well as lodges and private individuals have contributed to the amusement and comfort of the little wards. These benefactors are too numerous to here mention, though we want tq express our appreciation for all that has been done. Indeed I hope that we may hold this kind friendship through all times, for little do out friends realize how they help through their en - deavors to bring the little fellows to a state of normalcy. ■ Respect full)' submitted, ' J. 11.

            <seg id="p145">To the Governor and the Board of Control of State Institutions, Lincoln, Nebraska. I hereby present to you the Biennial Report of the Nebraska State Penitentiary covering the period from July 1, 1927, to June 30, 1929. We have employed at the present time about four hundred men making work shirts, work pants, and lumber jackets ; seventy-five manufacturing fiber and overstuffed furniture; seventy-five on construction work, dairying, stock raising, farming and gardening , the remainder of the men are employed as engineers, coal shovelers, cell house men, cooks, waiters, porters, mechanics, and other posi - tions necessary to carry on the work of the institution. The women are employed m the making of dress shirts and garments of different kinds for other institutions. We still have a very crowded condition, being required to house some two hundred men outside our cell houses, this making it necessary to increase our number of guards. However, this con - dition has been somewhat relieved by converting a portion of the old building used as a power plant, inside the walls, to a dormitory, and the building of a small dormitory near our new power plant for the housing of helpers m the power plant. Our prison night school, where work up to and including the ninth, grade is taught, is well attended. About two hundred men are enrolled. We find this school very beneficial to our men and they work faithfully to improve their education. Reverend Maxwell, our regular chaplain, and Father Ford, our voluntary chaplain, and a number of Lincoln people look after our religious work on Sundays. For diversion, we have ball games on Saturday afternoons and picture shows on Sunday afternoons, as well as periods of outdoor recreation. Our prison library is cared for by one of the men and is well patronized by the inmates. In conclusion 1 wish to thank the Honorable Board of Control, and His Excellency the Governor, for their kind consideration and administration m the affairs of the institution. I also wish to extend sincere thanks to my co-workers for their loyalty and co-operation. Respectfully submitted, ' W. T. FENTON, Warden. 145 </seg>

            <seg id="p159">To the Governor and the Hoard of Control of State Institutions, Lincoln, Nebraska. We are pleased to submit for your consideration the twenty - second Biennial Report of the Nebraska Industrial Home. There has been no great change m the constructive work of former years, hut we can see improvement m all departments. Our work is divided into details lasting for eight weeks each. One of the commendable features is to watch each girl's progress. We so often hear them say that the time, spent m the Home is profitable to them. We endeavor to give them as far as possible training m the line of work which will enable them to earn a livelihood, if they are dependent upon their own resourses. We have stressed dramatics more the past two years, and the girls have responded very well indeed. Some excellent entertain - ments have been given. We hope to extend this phase of the work, for a number of our girls have shown marked ability. It is only by this means that we can break away from our regular routine, as the only other means of entertainment are the .radio program. We are hoping a moving picture apparatus may be installed this coming year. We have over one thousand volumes— fiction, history, and the classics — and the best magazines m our library, which is managed the same as any public library. Most of the girls derive a great deal of enjoyment and help from the reading matter. We are continuing to get results from the religious training given. The girls look forward to these services and all take an active part. . . 159 </seg>
            <seg id="p160">Over fifty-seven per cent of the girls have kept their children, and with but few exceptions are doing very well. We are still find - ing it difficult to obtain employment for the girl who wishes to keep her child with her, when she must depend wholly upon her own efforts. There are so few openings for a young mother and her child, where she can make a living wage, regardless of her capabilities. We have been so very fortunate m finding excellent homes for the babes. A number of homes have taken two children. Our population has been lower the past year. We |have had many applications for admission, but due to having no facilities for the segregation of those afflicted with venereal diseases, we could not admit those affected. However, as soon as we have the new hospital building, we can then admit these cases. We have watched with interest the progress of our dairy herd. One year ago we purchased a registered bull. We also purchased four head of young registered stock, which will enable us to build up a fine herd. We sold four of our grade heifer calves at a very good figure. These heifers are to be for the calf clubs, j We have had a large Hock of Rhode Island Red chickens, and have had more eggs than we could consume, so have sold a great many. We had been able to furnish butter, not only for our own consumption, but sold both butter and cream. On account of lack of room we cannot extend either the poultry or dairy industries, and both are profitable, as well as furnishing employment to our girls, and many of them are interested m both of these lines of work. During the biennium a number of' outstanding improvements have been made : Installation of an ice-plant and refrigeration cooling system. Concrete floors m front of boilers. The fire boxes and combustion chambers of both boilers have been built. . . . Floor coverings for. hospital rooms, kitchen, halls, and sun parlor. Roofs have been replaced on boiler room, laundry, storeroom and coal house. . Pergola walk, which can be enclosed m winter between build - ings, fills a long felt need as well as adds so much to the attractive - 160 </seg>
            <seg id="p161">ness of our grounds. The walls m both main buildings have been or will be redecorated; Fire extinguishers have been installed m all buildings. Water tower and fire escape have been painted. In conclusion, we wish to express our appreciation and gratitude to the members of the Board of Control for their con - fidence, co-operation and consideration at all times. I wish to thank each of my co-workers for their hearty support, loyalty and earnest efforts m helping to make this a real home for those who come to us for care and protection. Respectfully submitted, M. EVELYN MEYER, Superintendent. 161 </seg>

            <seg id="p171">To the Governor and the Board of Control of State Institutions, Lincoln, Nebraska. This report covers the progress of the Nebraska School for the Blind during the biennium from and including July 1, 1927, to June 30, 1929. The enrollment has been slightly higher during this period than it was the preceding two years. In every school for the blind much time is devoted to the reading of books and magazines. This practice is followed here, much to the pleasure and profit of the pupils, though the need is not so great as it was ten years ago, before the radio came into such general use. The graduates of this year were all blind and all boys. This is quite remarkable as one would expect m a graduating class of five, following the law of averages, to find three boys and two girls. The ratio of students m schools for the blind over the whole of the United States is m about the ratio of three males to two females. It is the ratio approximately that has obtained m our school since its founding more than half a century ago. The boys, who graduated this year were widely separated over the State, illustrating the broad service rendered by this institution. The most difficult problem facing our school is that of looking ahead toward a successful future for our people. This is hard m the case of all graduates — the ones who, with normal senses go out from either high school or college as well as the handicapt, who, as m our particular case, are bereft wholly, or seriously impaired, m the sense most used. We cannot say, m the case of ours, any more truly or with greater assurance than other schools say of their graduates, who will succeed and who will fail to make a living. We can but do our best m the way of preparation and by the giving of advice. Each must work out his own destiny. In addition to the regular diplomas for finishing the course of high school subjects — the equal m every respect of the courses offered by high schools of the public school systems m Nebraska — we have also, during the past school year, granted three tuning certificates. 171 </seg>
            <seg id="p172">During the year we have lost two of the three officers of the school. Mrs. Mary S. Hayward, our matron, was compelled to resign on account of bad health. Dr. William S. Yager, physician, was commissioned by the Board of Control to a staff position al the great hospital at Ingleside. We have been fortunate m securing for their respective places Mrs. Erne B. McFarland anl Dr. David D. Stonecypher. The year's work has been especially trying for a number of reasons. In a minor way these two changes m the personnel of our staff force contributed. Any break m the people m charge always occasions some unrest. In addition the winter was especially severe — low temperatures, bad roads, and general disagreeablencss. Then. we went thru two epidemics — of diphtheria just before the Christ - mas holidays and measles shortly after the school renewed m January, 1929. One of the hardest problems to lace us and all officers of similar schools is that of preventing our students from becoming institutionalized. They are shut away from the contacts which come naturally to the public school pupil ; or to the normal boy or girl growing up m the normal family atmosphere. This we can overcome only partially, this drawback of institutional life: We urge attendance upon church and Sunday school ; our older girls have advantage of association with girls friendly society and the altrusa. In the past year our senior boys were invited to a luncheon by the Lions. Shortly after the coming of Dr. Stonecypher. to our force it was arranged that a careful physical examination (a much more thoro and searching examination than the one on registration of pupils) should be given each student, the tabulations of causes, etc., to be available for scientists everywhere. The general lines of examination were to follow those at other institutions maintaine '. for the benefit of blind folk. Toward this end a room m our isolation hospital was fitted up and the work begun. It was not wholly finished at the time school closed for the summer vacation, due to a number of reasons. This will be. taken up again vigorously at the opening of the school year and will be pushed toja satis - factory conclusion. As far as possible we shall extend the advantages of this examination to other blind folk-j-former graduates or pupils or those who may never have been enrolled here. 172 </seg>
            <seg id="p173">I wish to note that three of our four graduate teachers, realizing the great benefit of such examination, voluntarily submitted them - selves. I appreciated highly this volunteering on their part. The scope of examination covers not alone the matter of blindness; but reaches out as well to the whole physical and mental condition. Thus it is of untold benefit m the case of severe sickness to any pupil. Our physician has the record before him from the beginning of the illness. It is a happy augury that our pupils are getting to us younger m life and that we have fewer adults. We can do very much more for children if they reach us early m life. Adults complicate matters greatly; Tlieir habits are formed; they dislike school discipline ; and they f requently are not good associates for younger folk. The school is not ready to deny its advantages to one who has lost vision after maturity. That would be unfortunate. But we should guard well against a tendency to make the institution a home for adults. In conclusion there is hardly need for me to say that I have enjoyed working under the Board of Control ; and that I have appreciated the support given to me by the Board and its sympathy m our efforts. •.

            <seg id="p179">To the Governor and the Board of Control of State Institutions, Lincoln, Nebraska. I beg to submit this the Thirtieth Biennial Report of the Nebraska School for the Deaf, it covering the period from July 1, 1927, to June 30, 1929. Since the school's opening m .1869, there have been 1,215 chil - dren enrolled, 192 being m attendance at the close of the last term m June, of whom 112 were boys and 80 were girls. Deafness is a handicap requiring the use of special methods for attaining educational results. The deaf child entering our school at six years of age, is without language and without the knowledge which comes through language uses. The iirst and principal task is, then, to give language, and this by employing senses still m the child's possession. Equipped as the child is by nature with all needed speech organs, it remains for the teacher to give training m the use of these organs m the production of intelligible speech. Without the aid of hearing, this must be done by use of the child's sense of sight chiefly, aided more or less by his sense of feeling, he seeing the visible speech positions assumed m pronouncing words by the teacher, and feeling, with hand on the tacher's throat, the vibrations of hidden organs. Speech thus becomes for the deaf child a matter of position and action of the various vocal organs m proper sequence and with voice modulation, all directed by the teacher. Besides giving speech and- ability, to interpret speech by watch - ing the movements of a speaker's lips, the work of the school is plarjned to educate m the various branches of school study, with it the purpose to fit the youth for life and for assuming its duties and discharging its responsibilties. With the rest, industrial training is given — to boys m carpentry, cabinet making, painting, printing, and gardening; to girls m domestic art, domestic science, and household care and duties. The ratio of the deaf to the hearing m the general population 179 </seg>
            <seg id="p180">being approximately one to two thousand, it can be assumed that that ratio prevails among children of school age.. Thus our nearly 200 pupils represent 40(),(XX) youth of school age m the state's population. Our statistics show that of 192 pupils m school, 121 were born deaf, leaving 71 as having acquired deafness through sickness or disease. The chief causes of deafness among children are spinal meningitis, scarlet fever, and influenza. There is no accounting for congenital deafness except that m cases it seems to be inherited. Hence, the born deaf are advised, if they marry at all, to marry hearing persons, or at least persons adventitiously deaf. Our school course of study at present covers twelve grades, and it is usually completed by the average boy or girl m twelve to thirteen years. The twelfth or graduating grade corresponds to the first year m high schools for the hearing. It is m mind that we shall add to the courses given, three years more to bring the work up to the level of that given the hearing brothers and sisters of our pupils. The 192 pupils m school at the close of the term were under nineteen class teachers, there being thus an average of ten pupils m a class. It is found necessary, the instruction being largely individual, to limit the number of children that a teacher may undertake to train. Moreover, the work being special and involving unusual educational difficulties, it is important that instructors possess a high type of native teaching ability, also that they shall have had training along the special lines pursued m the work. We are fortunate m the fact- that our teachers have had, quite generally, training preliminary to . entering the work. But, even more desirable than training is successful experience m teaching m our own or other schools. A successful teacher is a distinct asset to the state, and to bring into the service of the' school, or to retain m its service, teachers of the superior type, salaries must needs be offered that will, m their measure, meet competition with other schools of the country bidding for their services. I therefore am moved to urge that the Hoard take such measures as it may to secure a material increase m the salary fund allowance for our school, m order that our force of instructors shall be built up to the highest attainable level of teaching ability for accomplishment of the work m hand. 180 </seg>
            <seg id="p181">We feel grateful for the continued interest of the State Library Commission as shown m its gifts to our school library of books and magazines for the use of our students. The erection of the new school building provided for by the Legislature, gives class rooms to accommodate thirteen classes. The school having at present nineteen regular classes, it is necessary to still occupy six school rooms m the old school building. The additional unit planned for to complete the new building when provided will give accommodation meeting present requirements and also provide for future growth of the school. In closing this report, 1 wish to express my thanks to the members of the Board of Control for the helpful interest they have always manifested m the school and its work, and to the teachers, officers and employees' of the school, also, for their co-operation m promoting the objects of the school along lines of effective accomplishment. Respectfully submitted, F. W. BOOTH, Superintendent. 181 </seg>

            <seg id="p191">To the Governor and the Board of Control of State Institutions, Lincoln, Nebraska. I respectfully submit the following report of the work done the two years ending June 30, 1929. Many changes have been made m the buildings and grounds. The eight room farm cottage has been moved so as to be on the line with the Barracks, East Hall and West Hall. The garage has been moved back of East Hall. It has been added to so there is room for four automobiles. The old vegetable cellar has been done away with. A new and larger vegetable cellar has been built back of East Hall. The legislature has allowed us $6,000 for a new barn to replace the one we lost by fire. An ornamental hedge has been planted all around the front lawn. A gravel driveway with cement curbing has been completed. Next to the gateway the driveway is paved. A cement sidewalk has been put m between East and West Hall and to the garage. Both East Hall and West Hall have been painted and decorated on the. inside. The frame buildings have all been painted. This spring we bought a new Ford truck with a grain body and some farm machinery to help care for our alfalfa. Our land is mostly m corn and alfalfa. The corn is put m the tile silo which was built last year. The corn land has been fenced so the cattle could run m the cornstalks. Ingleside and the State Hospital at Lincoln kindly gave us Hower plants and plants for our garden. The garden has been a great help. Beans, peas, corn and beets have been canned and some saver kraut made. We raised chickens so we had plenty for all on holidays. When the price o-f eggs was low many dozen were preserved m water glass for use m the kitchen during the winter. The purpose of our Institution is to provide education and training so that our girls will become good citizens. The majority of the girls have some form of venereal disease. It is a joy to see them respond to the treatment and good food. The out door 191 </seg>
            <seg id="p192">life, fresh air and regular hours all help. In three or four months they have put on many pounds and are not the despondent, erratic girls they are when they first come. We 'have had no epidemics and the general health has been good. There has been five major operations preformed by Drs. Rell &amp; Rell all of which were successful. Every six weeks we have a change of detail so that each girl may learn different kinds of work. All the girls go to school an hour just after breakfast. A great many of them have had little schooling. The State Library Commission loans us books and sends us a number of monthly magazines. The girls learn to make their dresses, do institutional sewing and make shirts. We make shirts for the other institutions. Fancy work is taught and the girls all enjoy making pretty things. Our exhibit at the State Fair is mostly fancy work. Our church and Sunday School is on Sunday afternoon. Different ministers of York and Miss Jennie Lancaster help m the services. During the winter the. girls have got up plays and programs and one building would entertain the other building. We have had several babies here. If possible we send the girl to the Nebraska Industrial Home at Mil ford until she is able to return with her baby. We try to bring the women to a realiza - tion of the opportunities offered whereby they may forget their past unfortunate experience and make a new start. Since many of our girls are sub-normal the most to be hoped for them is to make them skilled manual workers and thus the)' become self - supporting. In most cases the inmate responds and will co - operate after being here a short time. In conclusion permit me to. state that the past biennium has been a period of progress and we are looking forward to even greater things during the next two years. Very truly yours, ALMA J. CHAPMAN, Superintendent. 192 </seg>

            <seg id="p201">To the Governor and the Roard of Control of State Institutions, Lincoln, Nebraska. I present herewith the Biennial Report of the Nebraska Home for Dependent Children for the period from July 1, 1927, to June 30, 1929. No race, creed or color line is drawn. The homeless, neglected or abandoned child must be received and cared for. The Home must be a feal Home to the white child, the Mexican or the Negro." These children are the future citizens of our great state and must be guided and helped m the process of building useful lives. The general health of the children has been good. Groups of tonsillectomies have been performed at intervals. Immunization for smallpox and diphtheria has been given. We had an epidemic of scarlet fever but were able to isolate and save the Home from quarantine. We had only two deaths m the institution — one from chronic nephritis and the other an infant of premature birth. Our children attend the public schools and we have children m every department. Owing to our ever-changing population our attendance is unavoidably irregular. Some of our children are retarded m their school work for various reasons. Perhaps their opportunities for attendance have been limited or perhaps they aie mentally slow ; at any rate, they need special training and attention that is not offered m our available schools. We feel the need of an opportunity room for these unfortunates. Desirable homes are always an objective m this line of work as our population must be moved to make room for new children who need our help. Investigations are carefully made before a child is placed. We like to know that the child is going to receive a large share of the benefits from any arrangement between the Home and the foster home. Adoptions are encouragd if conditions warrant after the probation period of six months to a year has passed. 201 </seg>
            <seg id="p202">During this biennium 414 homes have been visited, 277 children placed m homes, only 70 of whom have been returned. Our facilities for housing and the care of the children at the Home m University Place are about the same that we, had two years ago. Repairs have been taken care of as much as possible with the funds at hand. Our equipment is scarcly adequate to our needs, thus making the work of properly caring for these youngsters very hard, indeed. A fine new barn lias been added to our farm equipment, mak - ing it possible to Jiave a few horses,- cows and hogs, the care of which is a new and pleasing, industry for our older boys. This along with the cultivation of our forty-acre tract we consider excellent training for our lads of all ages. ■ . We have a wonderful location — high, dry and healthful ; beauti - ful trees, plenty of room out doors for each group to have, their own playground ; fresh air and sunshine m abundance. We hope that the law-makers of the State of Nebraska will make appropria - tions sufficient to add to this suitable buildings to make for its dependent children a real home; I wish to thank the different organizations for the truly fine things they have done for our children at Christmas time and for the interest they have shown all through the year. 1 extend my sincere thanks to the. Members of the Board of Control, including our retired Member, Mrs. Carrie A. I'irss, for their interest and support at all times; Dr. Hancock for medical aid; Dr. Thomas an 1 Dr. Matthai for surgical aid. I also wish to thank each worker m the home for his loyalty and faithfulness m the performance of the duties of the Home. Respectfully submitted, FLORENCE E. CRIST, Superintendent. 202 </seg>

            <seg id="p213">7 To the Governor and the Board of Control of State Institutions, Lincoln, Nebraska. As Superintendent of the- State Reformatory for Men, I respect - full}- submit for your consideration, the Fourth Biennial Report of this Institution, covering the period from July 1, 1927, to June 30, 1929. ' Seven years have elapsed since the opening of this institution and each added year finds it growing daily into a more thorough and organized institution. Our non-vocational school- brings about Splendid results. This school is m charge of a school teacher of many years, whom we consider especially competent to further the mental development of those who are placed m his department. It is intended to change the curriculum m order to get at the most practical .needs of this group and work out with the individual the essentials we feel that are necessary to give him a better understanding. An Intelligence Examination is given each inmate under the personal supervision of Dean Charles Fordyce of the- University of Nebraska, the results of which- often guide us m dealing with the inmate. To bring about the recovery of self respect and return to good citizenship plus a well determined -resolution to. live a better life is the aim of our Chapel Services, held each Sunday afternoon and known as our regular Chapel. Speakers of the day are secured from the clergy of Lincoln and the Inmates of this Institution look forward to these regular services which are strictly non-denomina - tional; m character. The need of vocational training is quite apparent m the cases of a large percentage of the lads who enter this institution. In con - junction with our School of Letters .we plan a more extensive movement m the line of vocational training. The Prison Labor Problem appears no nearer a solution than ever, but we have little trouble and our men are all busy and I trust that we shall be able to- continue to keep them so. Space to work m and added improved machinery would be a wonderful aid m this line of endeavor. We are most fortunate to have m our employ a "Farm Hoss" who is very thorough m his work — an excellent teacher to his farm crew. Our fields arc m fine shape ; we expect good yields. Our 213 </seg>
            <seg id="p214">horses and other live stock show a healthy condition and sales from this department for the last two years amount to over $7,000.00, The large majority of our inmates arc full of "pep" and crave action, thus our playground serves as a safety ralvc, where these lads can get into full action m the usual out door sports. Rase ball, foot ball, horse shoes and tennis are played more than other games. Almost every week we have "movies" which are furnished us b}' the large movie corporations, to whom we feel indebted for this charit - able "Sunshine" donated to this Institution. To the American Distributing Corporation, Omaha, we are also indebted, as this firm is most generous with films for "our 'use whenever asked. Almost the greatest punishment that we can. inflict upon some of our inmates is to den}' them their recreation privilege. Our sports and games are clean and enjoyed by all. The health of our young men is most generally good. We have had some severe cases of illness, but thanks to the watchful cure and treatment of our doctor, Dr. P&gt;. F." Finkle, we have had only one death due to illness m the entire history of. the Institution. We have had one suicide. Dr. J. H. Matthai, of the Orthopedic I fospital, has been most kind to act m emergency cases which we appreciate very much. A most potent factor m our Institutional life is discipline, there - fore much thought and attention is given it. Upon entry into the Institution each new arrival is left with the superintendent for a "heart to heart" talk, who explains the affairs of the Institution to this new lad, and endeavors to put into his mind that it is absolutely necessary for him to desire a better life before. he c:ui expect much upon the. part of the Institution. Obedience an 1 respect for law and order are put up to him as a rule and guide for his actions. Our Institutional needs are more land ; more buildings; up to date machinery ; large dairy herd ; dependable water system ; up to date hospital ; dentist, same basis as doctor, occulist also. To each member of the Board we feel especially indebted for the though ful consideration shown this institution and its officers m the many perplexing problems presented to them m the work of building this institution. To Governor Weaver we likewise feel indebted for his thoughtful expression of appreciation and his cheerful readiness and helpfulness m all matters brought before him for his disposition. Respectfully submitted, A. W. MILLER, Superintendent. 214 </seg>
