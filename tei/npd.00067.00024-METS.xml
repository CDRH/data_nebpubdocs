            <seg id="p003">Babcock Testing — Principles and Uses L. K. CROWE and H. V. DAVIS Dairy Husbandry The manufacturing of dairy products on a commercial scale began about the middle of the nineteenth century and was greatly stimulated by the development of the centrifugal cream separator m the late eighties. The invention of the Babcock test m the early nineties overcame some of the difficulties that had developed m paying for milk upon its butterfat content, since it was early recognized that milk varied widely m that respect. A number of practical methods had been developed by dairy manufacturing plants to de - termine.the butterfat m the milk. Among these were: 1. The creamery inch system m which a sample of each patron's milk was placed m a glass tube and after setting, the depth of the cream layer was measured. This was far from satisfactory since it took much time, and milk that contained a large percentage of small fat globules gave an inaccurate cream layer. 2. The trial churning m which a small sample of each patron's milk was churned and the butter weighed. Great care was necessary m this method to have the conditions alike m order to keep the moisture content of the butter the same for all samples. ?». The oil test churn m which a small sample of each patron's cream was churned, after which the butter was melted and measured. If the churning was not com - plete this method developed inaccuracies. This and the previous methods were slow and bothersome. As the result of much experimentation by the agricultural experiment stations, a number of tests were devised, of which that devised by Dr. S. M. Babcock * proved to be the simplest, least costly, most accurate for practical purposes, and most rapid m operation. The economic importance of the Babcock test was threefold : 1. It revolutionized the dairy industry by putting it upon a business basis. 2. It hastened and made possible the rapid development of the factory system of dairy products manufacture. 3. It provided a rapid and accurate method of selecting individual cows upon their ability to produce butterfat and thus was a stimulus to better breeding. • Dr S M. Babcock was chief chemist at the Wisconsin Agricultural Experiment Station. The test was patented and given free to the world m 1890. </seg>
            <seg id="p004">Nebraska Experiment Station, Circular 35 babcock test Essentially this method of determining the percentage of butterfat in certain dairy products consists in transferring a definite weight of the product to be tested into a specially constructed and graduated test bottle. Sulphuric acid is then added and mixed with the material in the test bottle. The bottles are then centrifuge.! or whirled three times in succes - sion, at a definite speed and for a definite time. Hot water is added to the contents of the bottle after the first two whirl - ings. After the last whirling the percentage of fat is read directly with a pair of dividers. principles involved The Babcock test is based on the principles: That an acid will curdle and then dissolve or digest the curd in milk, thus freeing the butterfat; that heat which is developed from the action of the acid upon the water and milk solids melts the butterfat; that difference in the weight or specific gravity tends to cause the separation of liquids; and that the appli - cation of centrifugal force (whirling) hastens the separation of the fat from the other constituents of the milk. Milk fat or butterfat has a specific gravity (compared with water which equals 1.00) of .93 while whole milk has a specific gravity of about 1.032. This means that one cubic centimeter of butterfat would weigh .93 gram and 1 cubic - centimeter of milk would weigh 1.032 grams. One gallon of water weighs 8.34 lbs., therefore, 8.34x1.032 equal 8.60 lbs., the weight of a gallon of whole milk. The globules of butterfat in milk, being lighter than the surrounding fluid, will tend to rise but are retarded by the interference of the other milk solids. Commercial sulphuric acid (H.SO,) first curdles and then digests the proteins in the milk. This frees the fat, and since heat is generated by the action of sulphuric acid and water, the fat is melted and tends to rise to the top. The sulphuric acid being heavier than the milk serum increases the specific gravity of the mixture, thus making it easier for the fat to rise. In whirling, the test bottle is in a horizontal position with the bottom to the outside. Whirling produces centrifugal force which causes the heavier material to go to the bottom of the test bottle and in consequence forces the lighter fat to the top. The Babcock test is based upon the use of a definite weight of milk or cream in the test bottle. In the case of cream, 9 grams are weighed directly into the test bottle which is graduated to read direct. When testing milk the 17.6 c.c. pipette is used for measuring the milk into the test bottle. </seg>
            <seg id="p005">Babcock Testing — Principles and Uses This pipette delivers 17.5 c.c. of milk (.1 c.c. of milk sticks to the inside of the pipette) . With milk of an average specific gravity of 1.032 the 17.5 c.c. will weigh 18.06 1 grams (ordin - arily figured 18 grams). The milk test bottle reads direct in percentage of fat with this amount. PH.

The sample must be uniform in com - position and representative of the material from which it has been taken. Careful testing will not correct inaccuracies in sampling. It is impossible to be too careful in sampling. MILK To sample the milk of a cow, pour the complete milking from one vessel to another at least 3 times. Then dip out a sample for testing — not less than 4 ounces, cover tightly to prevent evaporation, and set in a cool place. Milk should not be tested until at least one hour after milking because of the air incorporated during milking. If milk has stood long enough for the cream to rise, it should be poured back and forth at least 6 times instead of 3 times. In pouring do not agitate unduly so as to cause churning. Milk can lie tested satisfactorily only when sweet. CREAM Cream is thicker, more viscous and consequently more difficult to sample accurately than milk. It should be poured or thoroly stirred after which the sample should lie taken with a recognized cream sampler (slotted openings in the side thruout the entire length of the tube). It is difficult to obtain an accurate sample of cream by means of a dipper. • See Nebraska Standard - Dairy Law. Bui. No. 3. State nt Nebraska. Department of Apricu hi. re. </seg>
            <seg id="p007">' V Babcock Testing — Principles and Uses ABNORMAL MILK AND CREAM Sour Milk. — An accurate sample of curdled milk is difficult to obtain. Pour back and forth until thoroly mixed, then take sample as with sweet milk. Sour Cream. — Thoro mixing of sour cream is not difficult because cream does not contain as much curd as milk. Ac - curate samples depend only upon thoro mixing. If properly sampled, cream will test the same whether sweet or sour. Churned Milk or Cream. — If particles of butter appear on the surface of milk or cream the vessel containing either should be placed in a bath of water at a temperature of 105° - 115° F. (Fahrenheit) . When the butter particles have melted, the milk or cream should be poured back and forth several times from one vessel to another and sampled immediately. Even then such a sample may be inaccurate. Frozen Milk or Cream. — When milk or cream freezes, ice starts to form at the outer edge next to the container. This ice is very largely water, the other constituents being more concentrated in the soft mushy core in the center of the con - tainer. An accurate sample cannot be taken from the frozen material. To thaw, place in a water bath at 70° F. or in a room at that temperature until melted, then mix well and sample as usual. COMPOSITE SAMPLING A sample composed of proportionate quantities by weight of different lots of milk or cream is called a composite. A composite sample of milk is most readily and accurately taken with a pipette graduated to .5 c.c. (one-half c.c.) with a total graduation of not less than 25 cc. For example, in testing the milk from an individual cow, a considerable saving of labor is made by composite sampling, that is, the testing of a composite sample of the different milkings for the day. Since the several milkings may differ in quantity as well as in percentage of butterfat, proportional samples should be taken from each. The number of c.c. taken per pound of milk depends upon the total quantity represented by the com - posite. There should be not less than 100 c.c. in the com - pleted composite sample. For each pound of milk, use a number of c.c. large enough to insure a composite of at least 100 c.c. Suppose a cow is producing about 40 pounds of milk a day in 2 milkings. On the day the samples were taken, she produced 16 pounds in the morning and 22 pounds in the evening. Take 3 c.c. of milk for each pound of milk produced, 16x3=48 c.c. from the morning milk; and 22x3=66 c.c. from the evening milk or a total of 114 c.c. for the day. Mix </seg>
            <seg id="p008">Nebraska Experiment Station, Circular 35 together and the 114 c.c. represents a composite of the milk of the cow for one day. Since cream will not drain clean from a pipette the com - posite sampling of cream is advised only when the lots of cream are in containers of equal diameter, in which case a sample may be taken by means of a cream sampler. If composite samples are to be kept for any length of time some preservative should be added. Bichloride of mercury (corrosive sublimate) may be obtained from creamery supply houses in tablet form and is usually the most convenient pre - servative for common use. Directions for the use of these tablets are on the container. Other preservatives are potas - sium dichromate and formalin (40 per cent formaldehyde). In using the former, which is a powder, add just enough to give the milk a lemon-yellow color. One cubic centimeter of formalin to a pint of milk will usually be sufficient. Each time milk is added to the composite sample it should be thoroly stirred or mixed. A glass jar for keeping composite samples should have a wide mouth and a tight fitting cover or stopper. When using a preservative that does not color the milk, some coloring matter should be added to indicate that the milk is unfit for food. All the milk preservatives mentioned are poisonous. BABCOCK TEST FOR MILK PREPARING THE SAMPLE Milk samples for testing should be at a temperature of between 60° and 70 " F. as determined by a thermometer. They may be warmed or cooled by means of a water bath. When warming a sample, the water bath should not have a temperature above 85° F. to prevent melting the fat. After having reached the proper temperature the sample should be poured slowly from one container to another at least 6 times to insure thoro mixing. Rapid pouring will incorporate air bubbles, making the succeeding measurement inaccurate. Care should be taken that no cream is left upon the lid or sides of the sample jar. MEASURING THE SAMPLE Immediately after mixing, insert the tip of a 17.6 c.c. pipette into the prepared sample of milk holding it with the thumb and second finger of the right hand and then draw in the milk by suction with the lips placed at the upper end until the pipette is rilled well above the graduation mark on the stem. Quickly p'ace the dry fleshy pad of the first finger of the right hand tightly over the upper end of the pipette. </seg>

Blow the last drop of milk from the pipette. To insure accuracy, all tests should be run in duplicate. ADDING ACID Measure 17.5 c.c. of commercial sulphuric acid (specific gravity 1.82-1.83) into an acid measure or dipper. The acid should be at a temperature between 60° and 70° F. Holding the test bottle at an angle of 45 degrees, rotate it between the fingers, and pour in the acid very slowly. This will wash all the milk out of the neck of the bottle, and what is more im - portant, will prevent the charring of the curd and the danger of the acid spurting out of the neck of the bottle. Variations in the temperature or strength of the acid will necessitate the use of a slightly greater or smaller quantity. It is advis - able, therefore, to add the last third of the acid in three por - tions shaking after each addition with an even rotary motion. Acid should be added until the mixture after shaking and upon standing for a minute has a chocolate brown color. In mixing milk and acid, rotate the test bottle slowly until all the curd has been dissolved, always keeping the mouth of the bottle pointed away from yourself and others to prevent any possibility of injury from spurting acid. Sulphuric acid is very corrosive in action, will burn the flesh and will destroy cloth, wood, etc. Plenty of water and alkali washing powder will stop the action of sulphuric acid.

CENTR1FUG1NG (Whirling) First Time, — After the addition of the acid, place the test bottles in the centrifuge or Babcock tester. Always place the bottles opposite each other so that the revolving disc carry - ing the buckets or pockets for the bottles will be balanced. Use a bottle filled with water to balance in the case of an uneven number of bottles. In centrifuges with double pock - ets, use the outside pockets if both are not filled. Revolve the bottles at the proper speed, as indicated on the machine, for 5 minutes after that speed has been -attained. Stop the centrifuge gradually to prevent the breaking of bottles. Always be sure that the centrifuge or tester is level, securely fastened to a firm foundation to prevent vibration and is well oiled, clean, and free from foreign material. After stopping the tester, add water at a temperature of not less than 180 c F. until the bottle is filled to within one - fourth to one-half inch of the base of the neck. It is im - possible to have this water too hot. Soft or distilled water is preferable because sulphuric acid often forms gas bubbles in its action on lime salts in hard water, which collect at the surface of the fat column making it difficult to read. A pipette or a small glass nozzle attached to a container by means of a rubber hose may be used to add hot water. Second Time. — Centrifuge (whirl) the test bottles for 3 minutes at the proper speed after which add water at not less than 180"' F. until the lower extremity of the fat column is well above the zero mark of the graduation or scale on the neck of the test bottle. Add water carefully to prevent over - flowing, and if using a pipette, do not let the tip reach the fat column. Third Time. — Centrifuge (whirl) the test bottles at the proper speed for one minute, then place the test bottles in the water bath whose temperature is between 135°-140° F. for 5 minutes, after, which time they may be read. Any vessel of sufficient depth to hold enough water to immerse all but the upper one-half inch of the top of the neck of the test bottle can be used as a water bath. A frame of metal with compartments for individual bottles is a great con - venience. Tests may be read directly from a steam tester or heated tester providing the temperature of the air within the tester is between 135°-140° F. READING THE TESTS Remove only one bottle from the water bath at a time. Hold, the bottle in the hand with the fat column perpendicular </seg>

This sample tested 6.3 per cent of butter - fnt. and on a level with the eye. With the other hand place one point of a pair of dividers on the lowest point of the curve or meniscus at the bottom of the fat column, and the other point at the highest point -of the fat column, or where the extreme upper edge of the fat comes m contact with the neck of the bottle. The curved surfaces at the top and bottom of the fat column are called the menisci (plural of meniscus). Hold the dividers without changing the distance between the points and place one point on the zero mark of the scale of the test bottle and take the reading on the scale as indicated by the other point. Always read to the nearest mark or graduation on the scale. The scale on the milk test bottle is marked m percentage of butterfat, being graduated to 8 or 10 per cent m tenths of one per cent. If the test bottle is held toward the light the extremities of the tat column may be seen distinctly. Headings should be made rapidly as the temperature of the fat column will change, causing an incorrect reading. The dividers should be tight enough at the joint so they will hold any position m which they are placed, but they should move freely Dupli - cate tests should check within 1 10 of one per cent. EMPTYING THE TEST BOTTLES Empty the bottles into a stone or glass jar or on ashes The acid m the test bottles should be carefully handled as it will attack wood, iron, steel, tin and most metals except brass and lead. The test bottles are easier to clean if vigorously shaken during emptying m order to dislodge the white (calcium sulphate) sediment m the bottom of the bottle and then washed while still hot. </seg>
            <seg id="p013">Babcock Testing — Principles and Uses CLEANING GLASSWARE Test bottles and sample bottles should be rinsed out in warm water. They should then be filled with a solution of hot water in which is dissolved an alkali washing powder. Soap and soap powders are undesirable. Shake the test bottles vigorously, and clean the inside of the necks with a small brush. Then empty and rinse thoroly with clean hot water. If this method is ineffective, add a little sulphuric acid, shake thoroly, then empty and rinse with clean water. A pipette should be rinsed out with water immediately after measuring the milk and then cleaned with the other glassware. BABCOCK TEST FOR CREAM WEIGHING THE SAMPLE The sample of cream for testing should be prepared the same as with milk except that greater care should be taken in mixing to insure uniform composition.

With ;t 9 c.c. or other pipette transfer enough cream to the test bottle so that the pointer again rests exactly on the center of the graduated scale or swings an equal distance to either side of this mark. Add the last bit of cream slowly, drop by drop. If too much cream is added to the cream test bottle it may be removed by pouring it from the test bottle, inverting the test bottle on the finger and removing 'lie cream that sticks to the finger, or by inserting a slick or pencil into the neck of the test bottle and removing tin- cream thai adheres to it.

Kaeh bottle must be balanced separately on the test siidi- as they arc not of equal weight. If cream is spilled on the test scale pan it must lie removed lief ore the final weight is taken. To insure accuracy all tests should lie run in duplicate and should cheek within one-half of one per cent. ADDING THF. ACID .Measure out il c.c. of commercial sulphuric acid (specific gravity 1.82-1.831 , which should be at a temperature between 60 and Tn F.. into the acid measure or dipper, and add! this acid to the cream in the test bottle, holding tile test bottle neck at an angle to prevent the acid from charring the curd and spurting out the bottle neck. Add enough acid to pro - duce a chocolate brown color when thoroly mixed with f ne cream. Then add 10 to 15 c.c. of water at a temperature of at least 18(1 F. to retard the action of the acid; since cream contains a higher percentage of fat and a lower percentage of other solids and water than does whole milk, the acid is more liable to cause charring. The test bottles are centrifuged for the same length of time and water added in the same way as in the milk test. </seg>

After reading, the test bot - tles are emptied and cleaned the same as milk test bottles. BABCOCK TEST FOR SKIM MILK AND BUTTERMILK The same procedure is followed in testing skim milk as in testing whole milk, with certain exceptions. Double necked test bottles having a large filling neck and a small graduated neck are used because of the small amount of fat contained in skim milk. More acid is required for skim milk and buttermilk because of the greater percentage of solids not fat to be dissolved. If 17.5 c.c. of the available acid are required for the whole milk test, then from 19 to 20 c.c. of that acid will be required for the skini milk test. Skim milk tests should be centrifuged 10 minutes the first time instead of 5 minutes to insure the most complete separa - tion of the very small butterfat globules found in skim milk. The skim milk test bottles should always be placed in the centrifuge with the filling neck toward the center, so that the passage of the fat into the small graduated neck will not be obstructed by the filling tube. The reading of the test after tempering to between 135° and 140° F. may be made direct or with a pair of dividers. The graduated scale of the skim milk bottle has a range from 0 to 25/100 or 50/100 of one per cent of butterfat, the smallest graduation being 1/100 of one per cent. .1 It sometimes saves time in the testing of skim milk, butter - milk, or whey, if two whole-milk bottles are used together with the skim-milk bottles, since the percentage of fat in the sample may be too large to be measured in skim milk bottles. </seg>

If 19-20 c.c. of the available acid has been satisfactory in the skim milk test, then 8 to 12 c.c. will be sufficient for the whey test since whey has a smaller quantity of solids to dissolve than skim millk in order to liberate the fat, IB I __n — H BB KB « - --_■ r-'l ' H_ ___________________ Vw. 10. — 1.

If too strong (too high specific gravity), sulphuric acid may be weakened by allowing it to be exposed to the air. Do not add water to sulphuric acid as it will splash and spatter and cause much damage. 3. Make all tests in duplicate to insure accuracy. Milk test duplicates should check within one-tenth of one </seg>

If foreign matter appears in the fat column or directly below it, repeat the tejst. 5. Glymol or red reader is a white mineral oil colored red with alkanet root so as to produce a contrast with the fat column and is used only in cream testing. 6. Take all temperatures with a thermometer. Accuracy is necessary. Don't guess. 7. Hard water may be used if first it be boiled, or if a few drops of sulphuric acid have been added to it and it has been allowed to stand for all gas to escape. 8. Sharp pointed dividers assist in accurate reading of tests. 9. If possible, centrifuge tests immediately, otherwise they must be reheated to 180° F. by placing them in a water bath for at least 10 minutes. 10. Small shot or coarse sand used with hot water and alkali will help clean dirty glassware. DEFECTS AND REMEDIES The perfect finished test should show a clear fat column varying from straw to golden yellow in color with upper and lower surfaces clear and distinct. A dark fat column or one that has dark specks within or directly below it may be due to any of the following causes : Cause Remedy 1. Acid too strong Use less acid or the same quan - tity of weaker acid 2. Too much acid Use less acid 3. Pouring' acid directly into milk Pour acid down side of bottle held at an angle 4. Uneven mixing of acid and Mix milk or cream with acid mi) k with an even rotary motion 5. Acid too warm Temper to between GO" and 70" F. 6. Milk too warm Temper to between 60° and 70' F. 7. Failure to mix milk with acid Mix acid and milk immediately promptly after addition of after the addition of the acid acid 8. Failure to add water before Add proper quantity of water centrifuging in a cream test before whirling or centrifuging for first time. - - . ■ ■ . . </seg>

            <seg id="p021">Babcock Testing — Principles and Uses STAGE OF LACTATION (Time from h-eshening) As a cow approaches the end of her lactation or milking period, the quantity of milk produced becomes smaller and usually the percentage of butterfat increases. This is usually a gradual change and is illustrated by the following figures which represent a complete lactation period for one cow: Month o£ lactation t 2 of «n 31 31 28 ■&amp; *»"'»SH "SSI T 5 Av. milk per day, lbs. 49.0 71.3 73.6 69.8 62.7 60.1 65.6 A, ; _tnt.vcr cent' 2.17 . 2.11 ..*». *M 8,42 _3.42 ______ Month of lacUtToZr.Z.r....:„: ..8. 9 IO U 12 13 ?SStS^:::z=:::::::::::::::::::iioL7 iwi^inu "30.2 i«i.o 0.1.0 ft gjg^fe= • The average test of two days milk in thet middle of each month. ENVIRONMENT The interval or time between milkings may affect the per - centage of butterfat. Usually as the period is lengthened the quantity of milk at the following milking is increased and the percentage of butterfat is decreased. Shortening the interval between milkings tends to reduce the quantity of milk and increase the percentage of butterfat in the milk at the next milking. . , Any change from the ordinary, as in milkers, or from hand milking to milking machines, or from one . stanchion to an - other or from one group of cows to another; or m fact any disturbance of the ordinary routine or any special excitement due to abuse, use of dogs in driving cows, loud talking, or the presence of strangers may temporarily affect the quantity of milk and the percentage of butterfat. WEATHER In general, in cool or. cold weather, a cow tends to produce milk containing a higher percentage of butterfat. Hot weather, especially when the atmosphere is moist, tends to lower the percentage of butterfat. Sudden changes of weather, such as cold winds, also affect the quantity of milk and the percentage of butterfat. FEED Early spring pasture tends to increase milk production and to decrease the percentage of butterfat. If cows are well fed, the percentage of butterfat cannot permanently be raised ' by the addition of any particular feed. Any change of feed may temporarily affect the quantity and percentage of butter- </seg>

Well fed cows, when partially starved, give smaller- quantities of milk of lower butterfat percentage. OTHER CAUSES Sickness or any bodily disturbance of the cow, especially a feverish condition, may affect the quantity of milk and the butterfat percentage. The percentage of butterfat may be either higher or lower clue to these conditions. The period of heat or oestrum may or may not affect the quantity and quality of the milk. CAUSES OF BUTTERFAT VARIATIONS IN SEPARATED CREAM RICHNESS OF THE MILK Milk from a herd of cows varies in butterfat percentage from day to day as has been explained. The cream or skim milk screws of the separator are set so as to divide the milk into a definite proportion of cream to skim milk. If, for example, the separator is adjusted to deliver 15 pounds of cream and 85 pounds of skim milk from each 100 pounds of milk separated, and the milk tested 4.5 per cent butterfat, the 15 pounds of cream would contain 4.5 pounds of butterfat or the cream would test 30 per cent (4.5 : 15 .30). If the milk tested only 4 per cent, then the 15 pounds of cream would contain 4.0 pounds of butterfat. The cream in that case would test (4.0 15 .2666) or 26.7 per cent. These illustra - tions assume no loss of butterfat in skimming. VARIATION IN SEPARATOR SPEED Cream separators are adjusted to skim efficiently at a cer - tain speed. If run faster, more skim milk is run thru and consequently less cream, and the resulting cream is richer. Such operation sometimes causes clogging of the cream out - let and a consequent loss of fat in the skim milk. If operated slower than the proper speed, the proportion of cream to milk is increased and the cream contains a lower percentage of butterfat. Slow running is likely to cause incomplete skim - ming. TEMPERATURE OF THE MILK Milk should be separated at temperatures between 90° and 98° F. At those temperatures the separation is usually most complete. Cold milk causes a smaller quantity of richer cream, since the cream is heavy and viscous and does not readily flow thru the cream opening, and consequently a larger quantity of skim milk is produced. </seg>
            <seg id="p023">Babcock Testing — Principles and Uses RATE OF MILK FLOW INTO SEPARATOR BOWL The valve on the supply tank is adjusted with the float to deliver the proper quantity of milk when the supply tank is full. When the valve is not opened completely, or when the supply tank is only partially filled, there is less pressure forcing milk into the bowl. Under such conditions, the centrif - ugal force in the bowl acts upon a smaller quantity of milk and consequently produces a smaller quantity of richer cream. Any condition that increases the inflow tends to decrease the richness of the cream. ADJUSTMENT OF CREAM OR SKIM MILK SCREWS The cream or skim milk screws regulate the proportion of skim milk to cream, and thus affect the quantity and rich - ness of the cream. The larger the quantity of cream, the lower it will test, and the smaller the quantity of cream the richer it will be. The cream screw when turned farther to - ward the center of the bowl produces a smaller quantity of richer cream and when adjusted toward the outside produces a larger quantity of thinner cream. In the case of the skim milk screws, the effect is exactly opposite. CLEANLINESS OF THE BOWL If a separator bowl is not washed thoroly after each separa - tion, the cream outlet may become clogged, thus causing richer cream and probably a loss of butterfat in the skim milk. QUANTITY OF FLUSH WATER At the completion of separation in order to prevent the waste of cream that sticks to the various parts, it is a good practice to run a quart or two of clean lukewarm water thru the separator to flush out the bowl and cream spout. As soon as the liquid flowing from the cream spout becomes watery in appearance, turn it so that the excess flush water flows into the skim milk. If the excess flush water is allowed to flow into the cream, the test will be lowered. VIBRATION OF SEPARATOR BOWL Any vibration of the separator bowl is likely to cause in - complete separation and a loss of butterfat in the skim milk. Vibration may be caused by an improperly balanced bowl, a bent spindle, improper adjustments, worn parts or an un - steady separator. </seg>
            <seg id="p024">Nebraska Experiment Station, Circular 35 CAUSES OF VARIATION IN MILK AND CREAM TESTS A true and representative sample of the total quantity of milk or cream is essential to an accurate test. This sample must be at the proper temperature and thoroly mixed at the time a portion is transferred to the test bottle. This portion must be accurately measured in the case of milk or weighed in the case of cream. Carelessness in any particular may produce inaccurate results. The temperature at which tests are read is an important factor in their accuracy. At the time of reading, the test should be at temperatures between 135° and 140° F. A low temperature tends to lower the reading and a high tempera - ture tends to raise the reading especially with cream tests. A few actual examples will illustrate the effect of tempera - tures upon the readings of the same tests: MILK TKSTS CRKAM TKSTS Correct Low Correct Low Hijih Temperature Temperature Temperature .Temperature Temperature 136 14(1 1 115 K. 135 1411" K. 115" F. 157° F. 5.1 5.0 24. . r &gt; 24.0 25.0 4.1 4.0 30.0 29.5 30.5 :.&gt; :;.; :u.5 :i4.o 35.0 7. il 7.8 24.0 23.5 24.5 Tests may be read differently by different persons.

Failure to correctly read the fat column is quite common and is usually due to not having the tests level with eyes or to the curved surfaces at the top and bottom. See correct method of reading tests on page 12. COMPOSITION OF MILK. On April 17, 1919, the Secretary of the United States Department of Agriculture issued, under the Food Inspec - tion Decision 178, the following definition for milk: "Milk is the whole, fresh, clean, lacteal secretion obtained by the complete milking of one or more healthy cows, properly fed and kept, excluding that obtained within fifteen days before and five days after calving, or such longer period as may be necessary to render the milk practically colostrum free." </seg>
