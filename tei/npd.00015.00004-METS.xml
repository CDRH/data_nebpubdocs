'That we need stale legislation in the interest of pore and unadulterated food products," says Mr. S. ('. Bat ry intelligent person will admit. If a food conun law is of benefit to the people of the state then it should be supported by the public and not by a few dealers who come under its provisions, but who are not personally benetitted to any greater extent than are the great mass of the people who are not dealers but consumers.

A careful observance of the analyses of the one item of vinegar as shown in this report, will show conclusively the ■shy of a food law covering all foods and condiments, which shall include all articles used for food or drink by man, whether simple or compound. Since May 8, 1903, the members of this commission have turned down upwards of nine hundred and fifty barrels of grain vinegar, colored to look like, and sold as. cider vine - gar or malt vinegar, and anyone familiar with the cost of vinegar can tell you that on this item alone the Commission ither saved the retailers a large amount of money or compelled the jobbers and wholesalers to furnish the pore goods which the retailers were supposed to have buying. It does not follow that because these vinegars were turned down that they were harmful or injurious, but simply sold contrary to law; i. e. they were artificially colored, which is prohibited. It would seem that the manu - facturers of distilled vinegar were doing theinselv. injustice by trying to make their g&lt;xxls look like cider or malt vinegars. There is no difference in the acetic acid found in cider, malt, or grain vinegar, it being the sour constituent and always the same, but there is a vast difference in the aromatic solids and color. </seg>

In ry hamlet in our rural districts from Maine to Oregon one mm the empty containers of prepared food prodi umulating on the common dumping grounds. And, go where you will, even to the lonely cabin of the pioneer or the isolated home of the rancher out on the great plains of the west, or even to the lonely shack of the prospector in the heart of the mountains, the empty tin can is in abundant evidence. IBy occupation I am a chemist, and I presume that is the on why I have been assigned the topic of "Coloring :er and Antiseptics in Food Products." By examining a large number of prepared foods in my laboratory, I have found that the use of coloring matter is •nsively practiced. Many times it is used where it might 1 be dispensed with, but in the majority of I is 1 to conceal inferiority. While this use is in itself rep - rehensible, what shall we say when coloring matter is employed that of itself is poisonous or unsanitary? tFrom a sanitary point of view coloring matters used in Is may be divided into two clfl First, those that admittedly harmless so far as detrimental effects upon health are concerned: and second, those that are dii ©nous or tend toward functional derangement of the ■stive, excretory or nervous systems. I Belonging to the first class are such substances as itto, tumeric, litmus, cochineal, and other harmless vege - ile colors. On the use of this class of coloring matter I not care to dwell. I wish simply to go record as holding • belief that they add nothing to the nutritive value of ds upon which they are employed. These colors, while ■y may be pleasing to the eye, do not make the foods re digestible, nor do they enhance its value in any way •ept in the price at which it is sold to the consumer. It y be that the aesthetic sense of the public demands these ght colors, but if so I am inclined to charge this per- erted taste to the manufacturers who are making poor use their stewardship in order to reap unearned rewards. </seg>

The application of these preservatives to food pro ducts is of comparatively recent date, and in the opinion &lt; writer, their use is a menace to public health and longevity. In discussing this part of my subject from a sanitary standpoint, it might be well to state that the use of chemical preservatives is for one of the following pur) First, they may be used to prevent fermentative or putrefactive process in the article of food after it is placed upon the market; or, second, they may be used for the purp&lt; arresting decay in raw materials before manufacture third they may be used for the purpose of disinfe tainted raw materials ii hai this material may be sold in the plac istuffs. </seg>

It is certainly most painful t question such as the one asked by a member of the firm of the Lincoln &lt; &amp; Spice Company treated in such a light manner by such an able periodical as the "Spice Mill" of New York City, unless they were aware the question was not asked in good faith. The article referred to is as follov "Is there a chemical peculiarity about lemon oil which renders it impossible or difficult for a chemist to find when combined with alcohol and water? We have noticed that some state chemists can find it in large quantities when the bottle bears the name of a large and influential manufac- turer, and absolutely none in a good extract of a small &gt;i em.

Wiley, chief of the bureau of chemistry in the agricultural department, makes the startling I tion that the adulteration of food and drugs has done morj to lower the moral tone of the Am3rican nation than has -sive use of alcoholic stimulants. The doctor gives it out authoritatively that one firm in Chicago which claims to deal in Vermont maple sugar manufactured more of the spurious product in one month than all the sugar busli Vermont produce in one year. H that the bright green color of imported peas is obtained by the use of copper sulphate, which is an active corrosive poison. This business of adulteration of food products, of wines and liquors, and even of clothing, h;i- me an inter national crime and the time is at hand for statute builders to take due notice and govern themsel ordingly there is anything that d&gt; t long term in durance vile, at hard labor, it is this new process of sacrificing the public - health for unearned profits. I We would especially recommend that the present laws the adulteration of food, covered by the Statut. •raska, be placed under the jurisdiction of this depart - it and mrfke suitable provision for an assistant to i he enforcement of these provisions. </seg>
