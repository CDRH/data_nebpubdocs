N inner 'uportations have lieen made from South Russia in the hope tliat the new importations might be better than our native Turkev Red. It is generally conceded now that no improvement hag lieen made liv securing new seed from Russia. Also importa of Turkey Red wheat from All&gt;erta. Tanada, known a.- Ukerta Red have been tried, but no improvement has resulted. iieiieiallv believed now that the mosr lo&lt;;ieal method of ini - ptvriag Turkey Red wheat is by some systematic method of ■ ■II or breeding. Work of this kind was undertaken by the Vebniaka Kxperiment Station in IMS under the direction of Dr. I' I. l.\on and has l&gt;een i-oiitinued since HMK5 by the present fi n Si:i.ki iiiin. Selections of new stock have made at ditto-cut times and a study has km made of The method of cari&gt; inn on the ex|&gt;crimeutal work. The plan at present is shown by the accompanying illustrations. \~ a foundation stock, individual heads are selected from Turke\ Red fields and planted iu short rows in the nursery as illustrated iu figure :{.
