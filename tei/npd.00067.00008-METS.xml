            <seg id="p003">Protein as a Wheat Price Factor RESULTS OF A SURVEY TO DETERMINE THE VIEWS OF NEBRASKA MILLERS ON THIS SUBJECT HAROLD HEDGES During the past decade a new wheat factor has quite definitely established itself m the markets of the world. Protein content has become a factor because it serves as an additional indicator of the quality of wheat. The United States grading standards for wheat established m 1917 give consideration to such indicators of quality as test weight, color and texture of berry, and percentage of foreign matter. Such factors do give a fair indication of the quality of flour to be expected from wheat but are by no means absolute or entirely accurate. Since 1917, however, there has come into general use a test for the quantity of protein m the wheat. Quality as well as quantity of protein is important, but even so the adoption of the Kjeldahl test for quantity of protein has added one more indicator of wheat quality so that grain may change ownership at a price more nearly m line with its value for ultimate food purposes. Nature, and Purpose of Survey.— The miller whose raw material is wheat must meet the needs of his trade. He must produce a flour that will prove satisfactory to baker or house - wife m order to maintain his business. The quality of his raw material is a vital consideration. His knowledge of fac - tors which indicate wheat quality and his ability to judge its quality accurately mean much m his business. His views of the reliability of protein content as a quality indicator should have weight. In February, 1927, a questionnaire was sent to all milling firms m Nebraska with the purpose m mind of getting their views of protein as a quality indicator and price factor Several questions were asked to determine the extent of the use of the protein test and the dependence placed m it and m other indicators of the baking quality of wheat. Replies to the questionnaire were received from 59 mills, approximately one-half of the number m the state. Much of the subject matter which follows is based upon the answers of millers to the questions and their general remarks on the protein prob - lem. Protein: Its Properties and Relation to Bread Making — Before presenting the results of the survey, a brief discussion of protein might well be m order. Those substances m the </seg>
            <seg id="p004">Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 221 wheat kernel which contain the important element, nitrogen, are collectively designated as protein. It is the presence of certain of these nitrogenous substances in wheat flour which makes it the best suited of the grain flours for bread making. Determination of the protein content is made chemically (the Kjeldahl test) by measuring the quantity of nitrogen present. Since there is a constant ratio between nitrogen and total protein, the latter is determined by multiplying the nitrogen figure by 5.7. Protein has become of increasing importance to the flour trade in recent years. A large proportion of bread baking has been transferred from the home to the commercial bakery. The baker demands flour that will produce the largest number of loaves per barrel and that will give a dough of such char - acter that it will withstand the severe treatment of mechani - cal mixers. It requires wheat of high protein content to produce such a flour. The housewife, on the other hand, does not require such strong dough. She mixes bread by hand and handles it with less severity than does commercial bakery machinery. She, therefore, is satisfied with flour from wheat of lower protein content. This transfer of bread baking from the home to the com - mercial bakery has materially increased the demand for high protein wheat, that is for wheat which produces " strong " flour. As a result premiums are paid for wheat of high protein content. These premiums vary from year to year, being highest, of course, in years when the desired type of wheat is relatively scarce. High quality of protein is as essential in a satisfactory milling wheat as is high protein content. Some wheats, such as durum, may be high in protein content, yet as a general rule they do not make good flour for bread making purposes. The protein is lacking in quality. As a result the loaf fails to rise well, and the bread is coarse in texture and poor in quality. The possibility of wheat of high protein content lacking in quality of protein adds to the difficulties of the miller in purchasing his raw material. Not all mills are affected alike by the protein problem. It is of particular concern to those mills which supply the bakery trade. The commercial bakeries, particularly those having large outputs, desire not only a " strong " flour but also a uniform product. Their baking is done largely by formula and they dislike to vary the baking process with each new supply of flour. They, therefore, prefer a flour that is uni - form in protein content and quality so that changes in their baking formula and processes may be reduced to a minimum. </seg>
            <seg id="p005">Protein as a Wheat Price Factor Many mills, knowing the value of satisfied customers, are doing their utmost to meet this situation. Use of Protein Test by Mills.— That the protein test is used extensively by mills, both large and small, was indicated by replies to the questionnaire. The question was stated as fol - lows: Do you purchase wheat using the protein test as a basis for judging its baking quality? A summary of the answers is given in Table 1. Table 1.— Extent of use of protein test by Nebraska mills. Fifty-nine mills by size groups. 1927. j Number "Do you use protein test?" I replying "Yes" "To some I "No" __ 1 extent" 1 AH mills 59 43 6 ~ io Small mills * 24 12 3 9 Medium size mills* 12 11 0 1 - Large mills *....., 15 12 3 o Mills not_givin£^utput_ 8 8 0 0 •Note: Grouping- as "to size was as follows: Small, under 10,000 barrels annual output: medium size, from 10,000 to 25.000 barrels annually; lar_e over 26.000 barrels annually. , Only 10 of the 59 mills did not use the protein test, while 6 of the remaining 49 made only limited use of it. It- will be noted in Table 1 that 9 of the 10 mills which did not use the protein test as a buying basis were small mills and the tenth had an annual output only large enough to put it in the second size group. This situation may be ascribed mainly to one cause. The small mills are dependent almost entirely on local sources for their wheat supply. The wheat is bought in small lots and it is not convenient to secure protein tests on such lots. Dependence is, therefore, put on other indicators of baking quality. The 6 mills which qualified their answers to the question did so to make clear that they did not use the protein test as the sole basis for judging quality of the wheat purchased. The mills which answered in the affirmative indicated by answers to other questions that very few of them used the protein test as the sole basis for judging quality, but con - sidered it rather as one of the most dependable bases for that purpose. Reliability of Protein Content as a Quality Indicator.— The consensus of opinion among the mills was to the effect that protein content is a fairly dependable indicator of baking quality. In fact, only 2 of the 59 mills replying to the ques - tionnaire said it was not a reliable indicator. Quite a large number of the mills (24 of the 59) qualified their answers </seg>
            <seg id="p006">Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 221 while 33 mills gave direct affirmative answers. Practically all comment by the mills on this point centered on the matter of protein quality. Quality of protein is equally important with quantity in determining the baking quality inherent in wheat. Table 2. — Views of Nebraska mills on the reliability of the protein test for wheat as an indicator of baking quality. Fifty-nine mills by size groups. 1927. j "Is protein test a reliable indica- Number tion of baking quality?" ; replying "Yes" 1 "Not entirely ' T No~' T ~~ I |_ so"t All mils .ill ,-(3 24 2 Small mills * 24 16 6 2 Medium size mills * 12 10 2 0 Large mills " lo 7 8 0 Mills not giving output 8 0 8 0 ■Sec not*- under Table 1 as ii&gt; sire grnuplntE. ■ The &lt;|ua!ined replies were equivalent tu this statement in substance. Interesting remarks were made by some mills in replying to this question. One expressed the view that protein con - tent, while not entirely reliable, was the best evidence of quality prior to grinding. Since it is not easily possible to make detailed tests of the quality of wheat in each lot before it is purchased, main reliance is placed on the protein test. Much of the comment was of similar tone. Tests Used to Supplement Protein Content. — Practically every mill replying to the questionnaire was of the opinion that supplementary tests are necessary to check the protein test as an indicator of baking quality. Such factors as test weight per bushel, presence of smut or other objectionable foreign matter, and presence of objectionable odors have an important bearing on the quality of the flour obtainable and naturally are always considered by the purchaser of wheat for milling. They do not, however, give any line on the loaf volume, color, or texture of the bread that may be expected after the wheat has passed thru the milling process. For this latter purpose, tests to supplement protein content are desirable. A main problem of the mills, if one may judge from state - ments made on the questionnaires which were returned, is one of determining quality of protein before the wheat is pur - chased. If protein is to be most effective as a price factor, some means of determining protein quality as well as protein content is required. A large number of mills have, partially at least, solved this problem. Of the 59 mills in this study, 34 put more or less dependence on knowledge of the sources </seg>
            <seg id="p007">Protein as a Wheat Price Factor of their wheat supply to indicate the quality of its protein content. Tho the protein content of wheat grown in any given locality may vary markedly in quantity, its quality is quite consistent. To quote the statement of one mill: " Relative to protein, the quality is most important but by knowing the locality it comes from, together with protein con - tent, you know pretty well this quality." A common prpcedure, particularly of large mills which de - pend on widespread sources for their wheat supplies, consists of early season baking tests and other tests of samples from different localities. In this manner, shipping stations which' are shown by actual mill tests to be in territory possessing wheat of good | protein quality are identified. Shipments originating at such stations are given preferment. One mill in writing of this stated, " During season we locate territory where most satisfactory wheat comes from." Another adds the point that "this changes from one crop to another but we establish it on each crop." By this means protein has become a more definite factor influencing the price which mills pay for their new material. Gluten Deterijiinations. — Of the nitrogenous substances in. wheat, collectively called protein, the two most important are gliadin and glutenin. When the mixture of these two in flour is moistened, a tough, rubbery mass commonly termed gluten results. The quantity and quality of gluten determines largely the amount of water a bread dough will hold without losing its proper consistency. This is of concern to the baker because the amount of water absorbed by the flour in form - ing the dough influences the number of loaves of bread obtain - able from a barrel of flour as well as the quality of the bread. Gluten and protein are quite often considered as identical and the two terms are used. interchangeably by many in the grain trade. The two are not identical, however, altho they do bear a fairly definite relation to each other. For example, a larger quantity of gluten is obtainable from high protein than from low protein wheat. The millers were asked to state on the questionnaire whether or not they made use of. gluten determinations. The replies are summarized in Table 3. Approximately 40 per cent of the mills made regular use of gluten determinations, while the majority did not use them at all. It is interesting to note that practically all (30 of the 32) of the mills which made use of gluten determina - tions also used the protein test. </seg>

The main objection to gluten determinations is their lack of accuracy. The manner in which the gluten test is made has much to do with results. Variations in the methods of mixing the dough, in the length of time the dough stands be - fore washing, in the manner of washing, in the temperature of the wash water and other variations in method result in differences in the quantity of gluten. Tho lacking in accuracy the gluten test may still be useful. Where a protein test is not obtainable, gluten determination may serve as an indi - cator of protein quantity and quality. The cereal chemist of one large mill expressed the view that gluten tests, carefully made by the same person so as to reduce variations in methods to a minimum, are very useful to indicate baking quality. Due to the possibilities of inaccuracy and the difficulty in expressing the results of the gluten test, it is not likely to come into general use as a price factor. However, it may be of value to the mill in checking the protein test particularly as to quality of protein. The Protein Problem of the Small Mill. — The small mill which depends on local sources for its wheat supply has a difficult problem to produce a uniform flour. Even tho its output goes mainly to the general family trade which does not demand a " strong " flour, uniformity in quality from year to year is an important consideration. Wheat grown in a particular locality may vary materially from year to year in quantity and quality of protein. Furthermore, the small mill lacks the facilities to secure protein tests on its purchases without going to much trouble and expense. Without protein tests to go by, the small mill must look to other indicators for evidence of protein quantity and quality and of baking quality when it purchases its raw materials. Altho chemical analysis is the only accurate method of deter - mining protein content, yet some dependence can be placed in such indicators as color and texture of the berry and test weight per bushel. For example, in hard red winter wheat, </seg>
            <seg id="p009">Protein as a Wheat Price Factor a wheat with a dark color (not due to heat damage) and with a hard vitreous texture is usually higher in protein than a yellow berry wheat with soft starchy texture of kernel Ordinarily a slightly shrivelled wheat which is low in test weight is associated with high protein content and a plump grain of high test with low protein. While not always true yet the assumption is that plumpness is due to presence of starch in the berry. While any one of these indicators of protein cannot be relied on, yet taking the 3 together they do serve as fairly reliable evidence of protein content. A knowledge of the type of soil on which the wheat is raised and of previous crops grown on it is made use of bv some mills. One small mill which is not in position to get regular protein tests on local purchases of wheat states "We 3udge a lot _ of our wheat from color, size of berry (wheat slightly shrivelled best) and ground where grown. Alfalfa and sweet clover land first year or two in wheat makes pro - tein wheat most always." A number of other small mills made similar remarks about knowing the land on which the wheat is grown in order to get some idea of its protein con - tent Thus are small mills making use of these evidences of protein m buying wheat locally, and overcoming the handi - cap of not having definite protein tests. Experimental Baking.— Baking- tests are of primary im - portance in controlling the quality of the flour output rather than as an aid in making wheat purchases. It is not to be implied that they have no value in this latter connection The point has already been mentioned that baking tests on wheat samples are very useful in locating sources of high quality protein. They also serve as a final check on the quality and quantity of protein in the wheat purchases. However ex- S™? 1 baking is particularly useful in trying out blends and testing the finished product of the mill Practically all Nebraska mills make at least some use of experimental baking according to replies to the questionnaire. Of 58 mills which replied to the questions on this point, 55 made regular or occasional baking tests. (See Table 4 . It is to be expected that the large mills should make more regular use of experimental baking than small mills. The lanre con - cern depends mainly on outside sources for its wheat and con - siderable variation m baking quality is to be expected from different lots. Its output is large and usually widely dis - tributed, requiring care in milling that it may offer stand - ardized products. Furthermore the size of the business often warrants the employment of a cereal chemist whose duty it", is to keep a close check on wheat and flour quality. </seg>

Numerous remarks of the small mills indicate that their baking tests are made in the millers' homes, or flour and wheat samples are sent to commercial laboratories for baking tests. In some cases, mills report definite contracts with com - mercial laboratories to make baking and other tests on their product. The baking test offers the final evidence as to bak - ing quality. It is natural that it should be in general use to check the quality of wheat purchases, of blends, and of the finished product. As a price factor, however, it is only in - directly effective. Best Tests of Baking Quality. — The mills were asked to designate on the questionnaire which test or indicator gave the best evidence ot" the baking quality of wheat at the time of its purchase. A number of mills qualified their replies by stating, in substance, that no single indicator was dependable, but that all must be given consideration. However, of 43 mills which made a choice of the best indicator of quality, 24 gave protein as best, 15 gluten, 3 color and texture of berry, and 1 locality where grown. Conclusions. — As a price factor — one which reflects with fair degree of reliability the inherent baking quality of a particular lot of wheat — the use of protein content has dis - tinct advantages. It may be determined with considerable accuracy and can be expressed numerically, thus affording comparison among different lots of wheat. The main objec - tion to it is that it does not reflect quality of the protein. Since the experience of mills demonstrates that the quality of protein is quite consistent for a given territory or locality for a given year, knowledge of the source of the wheat is an important supplement to protein content as evidence of bak - ing quality. Another objection to the protein test is the com - plicated chemical process required for it. The gluten test, while it gives an approximation of protein quantity and quality, is deficient in some respects. The wash - ing process by which it is determined permits of too much variation in method with consequent inaccuracies in the re- </seg>
            <seg id="p011">Protein as a Wheat Price Factor suits. It does have the advantage of not requiring delicate apparatus for determination and therefore may be used by mills which do not find it convenient to have protein tests made. The consensus of opinion among Nebraska mills is that protein content is a valuable addition to the* indicators of baking quality of wheat. Its adoption in recent years as a market price factor is therefore fully justified. Practically every car of bread wheat offered for sale at the leading grain markets has a certificate of protein content. Premiums are paid by millers for wheat which is high in protein. Local elevators receive these premiums. In relatively few cases, however, are these premiums fully reflected back to the indi - vidual producers of high protein wheat. There remains," therefore, the problem of making protein an effective price factor in the local market. Only when the good producer is rewarded and the poor producer penalized according to the quality of his product will there be real incentive for quality improvement. [3M] </seg>
