The Wabash and both of which arc compelled to pay for having their rom their terminals in Omaha to South Omaha, make id dit ion to the line haul for the service. Shipments from North Western moves from its terminal in Omaha over I'nion Pacific to South Omaha. The use of the k&gt; trucks involves a considerable expense. It is a matter tlie toads lacking the connections to South Omaha r they pay an intermediate road for completing the shipment or r they rent the tracks of another road and use their own motive for the delivery. There is an expense attached to either method. t ml shows that three of the roads thus situated absorb this but th;it defendant passes a portion of it on to the shipper. ■ndant seeks to justify its refusal to absorb all charges on the that it maintains a very low schedule of rates on live stock Nebraska stations to South Omaha, the inference beins that scale offsets the disadvantage to which the shipper is put payment of the added switching charge. The M. &amp; O. live ites ;ire no lower, however, than are those of other Nebraska -. us ■ comparison lor similar distances on the North Western and n Pacific discloses. Moreover, the Wabash.

If that were the only ground upon which this complaint rested, therefore, it would not be sufficiently conclusive of itself to prompt this Commission to issue the order prayed for.

CONCLUSIONS. lis case was taken under advisement by the Commission, nsideration and material changes have been made in the ate adjustment as carried by all railroads in Nebraska intrastate and finallv culminated in the issuance of the so-called General itr No. 19. Said order became effective September 6, 1914. At the time the above mentioned order was promulgated it waa illy provided that the rates therein named did not cancel n existing commodity rates on carload shipments. The effect order, so far as carload shipments of brick, hollow building and drain tile from the station of Ouren is concerned, was to a scale of rates to be continued on these shipments that waa than the Class "E" rate as provided in the Commission's Gen- Order No. 19. It would therefore appear unnecessary at this time scuss the Class "E" adjustment with regard to other class rates. led in the above mentioned General Order. Phe fact that the Commission established, in Nebraska Classifica- Xo. 1. Class "E" as a just and reasonable rating for carload shlp- common brick, hollow building blocks and drain tile, and in Order No. 19 provided a general distance tariff schedule of r&gt;r shipments rated as Class "E" articles, makes it readily ap - tliat the petition herein should be granted, at least in so far as esent commodity rates on brick from Ouren to stations on the P.

            <seg id="p135">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 135 r hearing, which was done. The date was fixed for September 2, 1915, Callaway, and upon that date all parties were represented. The complainants allege that traffic conditions, topography of the erritory, and their necessity and convenience require a depot, depot facilities and stock yards to be installed and maintained on the Caliaway- Stapleton branch of the Union Pacific railroad in the west half of sec - tion 9, township 16, range 24, in Custer county, and complain that the U fendant neglects and refuses to install such facilities at or near the ibove described location, but has installed such facilities two and one - nalf miles east of said location. The complainants allege that by reason at' the location of the facilities last referred to, they are inadequate to reasonably serve the necessity and convenience of the complainants, and about 75' &lt; of the patrons of the defendant, who live in the vicinity of the locations. In 1890 the Union Pacific Railroad Company constructed a branch ine of railroad from Kearney about 60 miles to the northwest, with its irminus at Callaway, which is located in the valley of the South Loup iver. Callaway remained the terminus for about twenty-three years, aid during that period of time, as the population became more dense, •omplaints to the effect that the line should be extended to the north- up the South Loup valley were common. The desire of the people &gt;r the extension of the line became so great that it afforded an oppor - miiy for the promoter, and one Durant went up the valley of the South .oup to the northwest of Callaway for a distance of about 30 miles and btained subscriptions for about $240,000 from the citizens for the purpose extending the line from Callaway to the town of Stapleton. There may be some question as to the ability of Durant to have carried out his project, but the interest that was aroused for the extension was forcibly ■ailed to the attention of the Union Pacific authorities, who, upon looking nto the matter, employed Harry O'Neill and John Moran to "get Durant out of the way," which was done by the Union Pacific paying Durant $4,"0ii for all of his subscriptions and contracts for right-of-way that he had previously obtained from the citizens between Callaway and Staple - ton. It seems then that the Union Pacific Railroad Company turned back to the subscribers all subscriptions and cancelled all contracts that had been made with Durant, and all parties interested got down to real earnest in the promotion and extension of what is known as the Calla - way-Stapleton extension. Harry O'Neill and John Moran then organized what is known as the Loup Valley Land Company and entered into a contract with the Union Pacific by which the said Land Company was to obtain right-of-way and depot grounds for the railroad company, for which the said Land Company was to receive from the Union Pacific Railroad Company advance information as to where depots would be located, in order that the said Loup Valley Land Company might profit by the pur - chase of land and selling it in town lots, etc. The following is a copy of a letter from Mr. Harry O'Neill to Mr. A.

Hegin ning on the south side of the river where it crosses the east line of section 9 referred to, there is a large range of steep hills, which extend to the south about six miles and form an elbow around to the east in the direction of Callaway. On the east side of the north end of the hill referred to there is another range of hills, which are separated from the first by a deep canyon. This range also extends to the south- </seg>
            <seg id="p137">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 137 east and joins the first range at the head of the canyon. The two ranges of hills then form a large table-land, which is known as the Murphy Table, and extends around to the south and east of the new Milldale station and off to the east in the direction of Callaway, leaving 111; narrow vallpy on the north of the table-land and on the south of the river. It is in this little valley, two and one-half miles east wile, where the Milldale station is located. Just up the river juth side and over the two ranges of hills referred to, there is i valley, at the mouth of which there are two bridges across the me on the east line of section 9 and adjacent to the hills. This ridge is located where in an early day there was a natural ford. The ther bridge is on the west line of section 9. The valley just referred to .1, divided by a low. rolling territory. The east prong of the valley is own as Kye Valley, and the west prong as Elam Valley. These valleys xtend to the south six or eight miles where there is a low divide which xtends from the elbow in the hills, above referred to, to the southwest. divide separates Rye and Elam Valleys from another large valley I Sand Creek Valley, which extends to the east on the south side • Murphy Table to Callaway. On the west side of Elam Valley there a large table-land called Cliff Table. The railroad passes through ■tion 9 on the north side of the river and crosses the river where the &lt;r makes its turn to the northeast and then continues down the nar- valley on the south side of the river to the Milldale station. Finch - is located on the north side of the railroad between the two public m\ bridges referred to. All traffic from Rye Valley, Elam Valley and iff Table have roads running down to the river over these bridges to nchville. However, in order to reach Milldale the traffic from the terri- st described must go over the hills above described, which are Lilly impassible, or it must cross the river over one of the two pass through Finchville, thence to the north and east around d of the river, thence to the east down the valley of the river north side to the section line running north and southeast of illda'.e. thence south across the river, thence west to Milldale. making distance from Finchville of 5.5 miles. The evidence shows that this itance could be reduced a mile by building another bridge across the er on the west side of Milldale. There can be no question but that Finchville is by far the most practical point for all traffic from the three points above described, owins to the topography of the territory south of the river. The two valleys and Cliff Table form about 75^*, of the farming land tributary to Milldale and to Finchville on the south side of the river. Extending from Finchville to the north and west, there is another large valley which heads in the hills about twelve miles from Finchville. This is called Powell Canyon. At the head of this valley, or Powell Canyon, there is a very' large table-land known as West Table. This is by far the finest territory of all that which Is tributary to Finchville and Mill - dale. It is called West Table because it Is cut off from the east by a </seg>
            <seg id="p138">138 NINTH ANNUAL REPORT canyon known as Dry Sand Valley. To the east of this valley there is another table-land called East Table. East Table is a district tributary to Merna, which is on the line of the Chicago, Rurlington &amp; Quincy railroad, or to the Milldale station by a road running down Pine Canyon, which will be hereinafter described. The natural course of all traffic to the south from West Table and Powell Canyon is down Powell Canyon to its mouth, where Finchville is located. In order for the traffic to n -n h Milldale it must pass to the east just north of Finchville at a point known as the Woodman Hall, thence down the valley and across the river to Mill - dale. On the east side of Powell Canyon, and running from the north - west to the southeast, is a range of hills. These hills extend from the West and East Tables, above referred to, to the southeast to a point about three and one-half miles below Milldale, but, of course, on the north side of the river. These hills constitute the roughest territory of all that is being considered. To the north and east and parallel with these hills is what is known as Pine Canyon, above referred to. The traffic from Pine Canyon, to reach Finchville or Milldale. must cross these hills, which is entirely impractical. The natural course is down Pint Canyon to its mouth on the river, and when the river road is reached the traffic is about as close to Callaway as it is to Milldale. However the location of Milldale is more accessible for the traffic from Pint Canyon than is that of Finchville, but Pine Canyon is only a small pel cent of the farming territory north of the river and tributary to the twc points. The topography of the territory under consideration is such thai there is a junction of three valleys at Finchville. and two of I leys lead back away from the river to two large table-lands juncture of these valleys there is an intersection of six public just north of the site of Finchville, two roads coming in from from Rye and Elam Valleys, one road from the west on the r of the river, one road from the north coming from West 1 down Powell Canyon, and two roads from the northeast. The complainants allege that they have constructed an Finchville, and complain that there are no shipping facilities to handle their grain. The Commission is of the opinion that they are estopped and should not be heard to complain, because they constructed the elevator after these proceedings were instituted before the Commission. In like manner the defendant alleges that it has installed a depot and side tracks and stock yards at Milldale, and that there is now being con - structed an elevator at that point. These facilities have all been con - structed after stenuous protests were made by committees sent to Omaha to the officials of the Union Pacific Railroad Company. The defendants should not be heard to complain because of the fact that they have already established facilities at Milldale. The question before the Commission is, where should the depot and depot facilities be located? After a two days' hearing in the matter at Callaway, realizing how difficult it is to become familiar with the topography of a large territory from conflicting testimony, the writer of the opinion drove about seventy </seg>
            <seg id="p139">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 139 miles over almost the entire territory, that he might acquaint himself thoroughly with the situation. He is of the opinion that the topography of the country, with main public roads, leading from the different terri - tories under consideration, centering at or near the Finchville point, and the number of people to be served who live in those territories,' war - rant the Commission to issue its order directing the defendant to install a depot, depot facilities and stock yards at the Finchville point.

Such com- parisons are of doubtful value unless all the conditions surrounding the service are known and taken into consideration. A brief examination &gt;f the illustrations cited demonstrates this. Take, for example, of the North Western from Fremont to Superior, shown as having but one passenger train daily each way. A glance at any map of Nebraska discloses that this line is intersected nine times by other lines of railroad, three times by main lines of the Burlington. On an average of every twelve miles an opportunity is afforded to the people in this territory to avail themselves of service on another rail - road. Contrast this with the situation of patrons of the Spalding branch. </seg>

The same conditions apply with equal force to the line ol the North Western from Fremont to Hastings, to the lines of the Burlington between DeWitt and Holdrege, Nebraska City and Lincoln, Nebraska City and Beatrice, Stromsburg and Alma, Lincoln and Colum - bus, and Ashland and Sioux City. All of these lines operate in a highly competitive territory, and with but few exceptions the people have Eto other service. With respect to the lines of the Burlington Orleans to St. Francis and Republican City to Oberlin, traffic ions are entirely different, the country being in the semi-arid 1 and but sparsely settled. The Scribner-Oakdale branch of the North Western is more nearly comparable to the branch under con sideration, but the demand for increased service has been so insistent even in that territory that the management of the road has proposed a three-months' trial of the second passenger train, application lor ap proval of its installation having already been made to and appro this Commission. Kt is clearly apparent, therefore, that but little importance is hed to the mere information that branch lines on other road service than is furnished for the branch in this case.

While these trains Hiry passengers, the service thus performed is only an incident to the reight business. The inclusion of these trains materially reduces the rage revenue per train mile. Excluding them, the average per train e is 65 cents. Taken for the entire period of seventeen months the htly less than 64 cents. \\ imparison discloses that the motor has increased the ■ traffic to some extent, the increase is not very great. in r to 3,328 passengers for the trial period and $749.41 in revenue, r carried 9,248 passengers during the period, but a consider- iortion of these were taken from the two steam trains already in ion. The increase in revenue was not sufficient to maintain the :e per train mile at the level established before the motor was I. this average being reduced from about 73 cents to 53 cents. Defendant relies on the fact that the new revenue properly — «f» - &lt;i&gt; the motor amounts to but 6 cents per train mile to prove that motor service is not compensatory. On its showing, the direct coat operation amounts to 26 cents per mile. This would indicate, there- hat the service is being operated at a direct loss of 20 cents per Such a method, however, disregards entirely the total amount of nue received from passenger service and whether or not that revenue ities the service as a whole. In the original order in this case the n said The earnings of the trains now in service average about seventy- r &lt; -i-iits per train mile for each train. The addition of two more tins would make the average earnings fifty-one cents per train ile, sufficient to leave a substantial margin above the cost of opera - m. of either class of train. On the present revenue, therefore, fendant could operate an additional train without loss, and even me profit. Any increase in traffic would increase these net and, as stated above, there is good reason for believing increase would be considerable." nstallation of the motor has not increased the revenue to the pated by the Commission, although it has resulted in some tional income. As stated in the other opinion, however, "on the nue. defendant could operate an additional train without nd even at some profit." It was the opinion of the Commission that the total revenues of the branch justified additional service and the motor was not ordered installed on the condition that it would pay its own way. Because of main line connections and local needs there is a demand for a wider service than can be furnished by the passenger train and mixed train. And the needs of the traveling public are as great in that respect now as they were when the motor waa installed, and if defendant can continue to meet these demands without net loss it should be required to do so. </seg>

Such an arrangement, it is contended, would obviate the operation of an "unnec - essary train at a loss." The method of reasoning in arriving at this s not made clear. The distance from Columbus to Omaha whereas the distance from Columbus to Spalding is 65 miles. w the steam passenger train could be run the extra 164 miles be- Colunihus and Omaha at less cost than the motor is operated between Columbus and Spalding is not explained. Aa a act, the direct cost per train mile of the steam train between and Omaha, on a conservative estimate, would be 24 cents. would make the cost of operation per day $39.89. Accepting the ir re of 26 cents per mile, submitted by defendant, as the direct cost perating the motor, we have $33.80 per day, or $6.00 less than the the extended service to Omaha. As a measure of economy, there - e proposal has no merit. The schedule proposed for the steam ■ a fast one. practically making it a through train between bus and Omaha. There certainly is no need for further passenger e of this character on this portion of the main line, which is I now by 14 passenger trains each way daily. The suggested adjustment, therefore, has but little to commend it from any stand - in' While depriving the patrons of the Spalding branch of a service lich they now enjoy and which they assert is entirely satisfactory, it Id add nothing to the revenue received by defendant but at the same would increase its expense. n the opinion of the Commission the foregoing findings amply justify der denying the application.

The plaintiff herein has not availed itself of the remedy for the hing complained of, as provided for by this statute, but instead has ome to the Commission. The interpretation of the constitution and the statutes enacted pur - naiit thereto by the Commission in its General Order No. 11, and by lie supreme court in the case of Herpolsheimer v.

This the defendant lid not do, but arbitrarily and contrary to the Commission's General rder No. 11 and contrary to the constitution and the statutes enacted .irsuaut thereto, reduced the local freight service on its main line be - veen Hastings and McCook from a daily to a tri-weekly service.

The defendant would not have been heard i) say in the district court that traffic conditions did not warrant the peration of the service that was discontinued. The district court is ncerned in those questions. They are for the Commission. light be that as the plaintiff has come to the Commission instead iistrict court, the Commission should treat the complaint as if ere an original application of the defendant for authority of the Hiinnssion to discontinue the daily service that was being given ac - rding to the provisions of its time table No. 130, herein referred to, in that case it would be necessary for the defendant herein to con - e the Commission that the change in the service was for the benefit of the general public, or that the service rendered was greater than necessary for reasonable and efficient service. From the evidence sub - mitted at the hearing by the defendant, and from all data on file with the Commission, it is impossible for the Commission to conclude that the service should have been reduced or that traffic conditions at the present time warrant such reduction. On October 18, 1915, and since the hearing, the defendant has made certain changes in its freight service on its branch lines west of Hastings, which is as follows: </seg>

At the hearing, however, many of the witnesses testified, and it seemed to be the consensus of opinion of all present, that if regular connections were made at Hickman with the Burlington train known as the Irish Mail, so that passengers could get to and from Lincoln via Hickman over the Burlington, the complainants would be satisfied. The defendant assured the Commission that this could be done. Thereupon, the Commission directed the defendant to make said connections at Hickman and to make reports of its operation of said trains. Said reports were made to the Commission from March ttl4 down to the time of the original order herein. The reports showed that said connections were not made for the period to exceed fifty p&lt;r cent of the time, and the Commission, considering the fact that the branch runs through one of the most productive and best developed territories of the state, was of the opinion that the service complained of was nm adequate and that the passenger traffic should be provided for by the installation and operation of one daily, except Sunday, passenger train §said branch.

Ont thing in particular is to be noted in defendant's exhibit No. 17 when it is shown that the only passenger train business transacted by tlu Missouri Pacific in the state of Nebraska for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1914, that showed a net operating income above expenses was the intrastate passenger business. The auxiliary service, viz.. mail and express, and the interstate passenger business, left no net operating in - come after operating expenses were paid.

            <seg id="p153">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 153 rtumment as to operating revenues and expenses when speaking of PI im-ss in the state of Nebraska as a total. The state n xperts are now preparing data to be submitted to the federal court thk-h will clearly show that when proper methods are applied to the A xpenses the passenger business of the Missouri Pacific in ven state of Nebraska is transacted at a profit over and above the pay - t of operating expenses and taxes and a sufficient return on the roperty devoted to the transaction of the passenger traffic. The order :i this case is based almost altogether on the inadequate service ren- lered by the Missouri Pacific Railway Company on its Crete branch In Nebraska, and we have mentioned some of the data submitted in the rehearing only by way of explanation. The defendant operates its main line of road in Nebraska from l City to Omaha via Auburn, Nebraska City and Union; a branch from Auburn to Omaha via Talmage and Weeping Water; a branch i ..in Union to Lincoln via Weeping Water; and a branch line from age to Crete. Passenger service on the last named branch is the und of the complaint. The defendant company operates over its main I from Falls City to Omaha three daily passenger trains; one daily ;senger train from Falls City to Omaha via Auburn, Talmage and .Veeping Water; three daily passenger trains from Union to Lincoln via A 'ct-ping Water; and one freight train, with a passenger car attached. Talmave to Crete, a distance of fifty-two miles. By reason of the : of the freight traffic on the Crete branch, it is necessary to Lclule the last named train so as to make connections with a stock n on the main line for Kansas City at Auburn. It is impossible to do ; and make connections with any of the passenger trains above re - •ed to. The company has admitted in the record and in conferences th the Commission that the service is not adequate, and the Commis - jii has given it every opportunity possible to bring the service up to sonable standard of efficiency. From all reports as to the operation e mixed train, and from the testimony of complaining witnesses, the nission is convinced that it is impossible to tell when the trains arrive at or depart from any station on the line, and as a result ens living in the towns on the branch and those in the country ad - it to the line go north and south to the two Burlington lines when wish to go to Lincoln, Omaha, St. Joseph or Kansas City. By reason of this, it is impossible for the Commission to know what the passenger traffic would be on the line if adequate passenger trains were operated which make connections at junction points with other main line passenger trains. It does not follow that because a freight train does not have passenger traffic to warrant the operation of a passenger train, there will not be sufficient traffic to warrant such trains if the trains were operated. The mixed trains carry freight of all classes and commodities, ex- press, mail, baggage, stock of all kinds, and passengers; on account of the stock and other freight handled it is a slow train and Is very often </seg>
            <seg id="p154">154 NINTH ANNUAL REPORT behind its schedule from one to five hours. There are many other reasons why a mixed train cannot adequately serve the passenger traffic, viz.: The odor from stock carried ahead of the passenger coach; stock cars, from the manure in them, are offensive to many people; it is delayed at stations in taking on and delivering freight; it subjects the pas - sengers to jerks and jars that make travel a burden; gang planks are thrown across the depot platforms that impede the passage from the waiting rooms to the coach; and many others that are known and well understood. Railroad corporations engaged in the transportation of passengers are bound to exercise the highest degree of care and diligence in tlu conduct of their business, and this does not only apply to the appliances Bbut to the manner in which they are used. There are great differ - between freight and passenger traffic, which have resulted in tin opment of two distinct classes of facilities of transportation. Kail road companies are not required to operate freight or mixed trains witli the same care and diligence in the transportation of passeng in trains as is necessary in the operation of passenger trains, but care as is consistent with the practical operation of such tn supreme court of Illinois, in the case of People ex re; \V. S. Col vs. St. Louis, Alton A: Terre Haute Railroad Company, 176 I discussed the matter as follows "It follows, that, when the only train operated by a pany Is a mixed train, passengers, being unable to r other kind of train, are forced to incur risks and sut veniences, which do not exist on a separate passenger train. H the operation of a railroad witli a mixed tra with the duty of furnishing such cars and loc iv sary to the suitable and proper operation of the railroad ga^ed in the passenger traffic. We are not unmindful of th that, within certain limits, a discretion may be exercised as t rolling stock and equipment are necessary for the suitable and prop« operation of a railroad carrying passengers. When the mode of carrying passengers is separate from the mode of carrying freight. the legitimate exercise of discretion may begin. What we hold that there cannot be suitable and proper operation of the railroad as a carrier of passengers, when the car, in which it tarries its pas - sengers, is part of a freight train, because freight trains are inferior to passenger trains, and travel in them is attended with less com - fort, convenience and safety than travel in passenger trains. The inferiority of a freight train to a passenger train as a mode of carry - ing passengers is so obvious, that no man of ordinary understanding would regard the use of a freight train for the purpose of hauling a passenger car, as a suitable and proper operation of a railroad in the matter of transporting passengers.' "The transportation of passengers on a freight train, or on a mixed train, is subordinate to the transportation of freight, a mere incident to the business of carrying freight. To furnish such cars as are necessary for the suitable and proper carriage of passengers in - volves the necessity of adopting that mode of carrying passengers which is best adapted to secure their safety and convenience. This can be accomplished better by operating a separate passenger train </seg>
            <seg id="p155">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 155 than by operating a mixed train. That is to say, the duty of furnish - ing all necessary rolling stock and equipment for the suitable and proper operation of a railroad carrying passengers involves and im - plies the duty of furnishing a train which shall be run for the pur- transporting passengers only, and not freight and passengers )gether When the state of Nebraska extended a franchise right to the Mil - i Pacific Railroad Company and the company availed itself of that ight by condemning rights-of-way and building a road, the company mlertook to adequately serve the territory through which its lines run, roth as to freight and passenger traffic. That passenger traffic cannot be adequately taken care of except by exclusive passenger trains. Is home out by the history of railroading in the United States. The Com- nission does not mean to apply this principle to all communities in the tate of Nebraska, but we think that it does apply in a territory which s the most densely populated and which is one of the most productive mil highly developed communities in the state. It may be that the &gt;ranch referred to, paralleling and running in between two Burlington &gt;ran&lt; h lines, as it does, for the greater part of the distance, should ever have been built, but the building of the line encouraged people 3 lay out and develop townsites and invest their money in those civic enters, and they are now entitled to a minimum passenger train service xclusive from the freight. The only question before the Commission that of adequate passenger train service. If the revenues received by I Missouri Pacific Railway Company in its entirety in the state of Ne- raska are not sufficient, the carrier has its recourse. It might be that in' defendant company could install and operate a daily train upon the te branch by reducing some of the service on one of the other lines. ■ instance, the company is operating three daily passenger trains on Lincoln branch and none on the Crete; four daily passenger trains the main line south of Auburn, and three trains between Auburn and aha on the main line. A readjustment of the passenger train service on the Missouri Pacific might be made which would give the Crete branch service and not reduce the net revenues of the carrier. It is not lary for the Commission to pass upon this question in the present The Commission is of the opinion, however, and so finds, that the ixed train on the Crete branch is not rendering adequate passenger service, and it is further of the opinion that the defendant should in - stall and operate one daily, except Sunday, passenger train each way said Crete branch. In the former order the Commission gave certain specific directions as to connections at terminals with other trains. The Commission is now of the opinion that that is a matter which should properly be left to the discretion of the operating department of said company. If proper connections are not made it will be a subject for further hearing when occasion arises. </seg>

It is the contentiui of the complainants at Hastings that this schedule is so arranged as ti make it very inconvenient for people living east of Hastings to em to that place in the morning and leave in the afternoon at a seasonable hour. The passenger arriving from the east in the morning at 7:1 leaves the stations east at such an early hour that but tew people ai tempt to use it except lor urgent business, while the east bound passeii£,i leaving Hastings at Id: 50 at night, reaches the same stations ai a ver v late hour, making shopping trips inconvenient and infrequent further contended by complainants, and admitted by det'endar the freight trains are so irregular in their time of arrival and de from stations that they cannot be used with any satisfaction public. The Fairbury complainants concede that the present from the west into and out of that place is very satisfactory.

In their opinion a lain would follow the installation of a more convenient sclied fied as to the unreliability of the freight train a public. They called attention to the popularit it was in operation in lull and predicted a service was reinstalled. Two witnesses from Kairbury testified to about the facts, except that they made no complaint as to the servic from the west, which they say is satisfactory. They des train arriving at Fairbury during the forenoon and leavir noon or evening. I Representatives of the commercial club at Edgar appeared to protest nst any change in the present service, alleging that it is satisfactory that the public is not asking for a change. They frankly stated they are opposed to a shopping train that will take people from r town and territory into Hastings. As a defense to the complaint defendant contends that the railroad has been operated for several years at a loss, the revenues not being sufficient to pay the expenses and a reasonable return on the investment </seg>
            <seg id="p161">NKUKASKA STATK IIA1LWAY COMMISSION 161 is shown that there was a small surplus left at the end of the year 15, but that that was due to the fact that the I'nion Pacific, through ts so-called Gibbon cut-oft', had turned to defendant a considerable riM^lii traffic Aceording to a statement submitted, the gross passenger venues for the system for the years 1908 to 1915. inclusive, were as Hot 377,113.17 415.014.70 455,800.09 405.478.17 :?85,685.75 !tl4 347.503.80 This indicates a steady falling off in passenger receipts for the eriod covered. It is significant, however, that in the year during which he motor was operated (1911) the revenues reached the highest point or the period. Analysis of the revenues for that year, however, show t tarn in interstate business as well an intrastate, indicating that the notor was not entirely responsible for the increase, although it may »■ fairly credited with a considerable portion of the added revenue. De - endant further contends that it is essential, in arranging its passenger ichedu'e. to have in mind the connections with other lines at its terminals Urand Island and St. Joseph. The heavy traffic into and out of St. *eph must also be considered and train service provided tha* will ■runt passengers to get into that city in the morning and out in the ening. It is impossible to meet these conditions and at the same time provide with the same trains an entirely satisfactory service at stations midway between the terminals. However, the necessity (or meeting the conditions at the terminals is so imperative that defendant does not feel it would be justified in readjusting the schedule of the present trains to satisfy this complaint. To this complainants answer that they should not be compelled to undergo all the disadvantages arid that they have interests that are entitled to as much consideration as is given to the requirements at the terminals. Defendant also shows that its passenger service is as extensive and adequate as that furnished by the other lines serving Hastings and Fairbury, two passenger trains and ,i freight daily being equal to the average provided by the other roads. From the facts shown in this record the Commission is very much in doubt as to the probability of an added motor car producing enough additional revenue to justify its operation. Doubtless, as in the former trial of the motor service, the revenue earned by the car itself would be sufficient to pay the operating expense and a small profit, but whether the passenger revenue as a whole would be sufficient to compensate defendant for operating all the trains is problematical, for much of the revenue earned by the motor would be taken from the trains already in service. The population of the territory involved, the size of the towns served by the road and the passenger service already provided render </seg>
            <seg id="p162">162 NINTH ANNUAL UEI'OKT it unlikely that much additional traffic would tv croated by additional There has been a demand in this territory, however, lor more ex - tensive service. It is admitted by defendant that the present local ser - vice is somewhat inconvenient and probably does not produce as much local traffic as might be secured if the trains could be run on a more favorabie schedule. While doubtful as to any additional service justi fying itself, the Commission is inclined to require a trial of a motor car to definitely determine the matter. Defendant owns at Hie present time three or four motor cars which are not in use. It would not be to the expense, therefore, of a heavy initial investment. Figures as to the cost of operation of the cars as formerly operated by defendant were made a part of this record. They show that the direct cost of operation, including wages of the motorman and conductor, hostlers and cleaners, cost of fuel, gasoline, oil, waste and supplies, and the maintenance of the car, amounted to fifteen cents per train mile. Mr. Meyer, auditor of the road, stated that he thought that figure rather low because ol the rather abnormally low expense for maintenance, and expressed the opin ion that the figure should be increased to seventeen cents. The direct cost of operation constitutes approximately fifty-live p ita cost of operation, exclusive of taxes and return on the inv ut ing the total cost about thirty-one cents per train mile. A r K defendant would not have an actual outlay of cash covered in the remaining forty-live per cent, fur and overhead expense is fixed and has to be cart iditional service is furnished or not. This is ;i fact « sideration in a case like the present one, wher doubtful of resulting favorably. In other words increase, the company will not be put to any considerable additional expense. The distance between Hastings and Kairbury is about eighty miles. At a cost of thirty-one cents per train mile, the expense to de - fendant would amount to approximately fifty dollars per day. For a period of ninety days, therefore, the total expense would amount to about $4,500.00. Some additional revenue should, of course, be developed so that all of this amount would not be loss. It is the opinion of the Commission, therefore, that a motor car service should be installed between Hastings and Kairbury. or, if de - fendant prefers, between Hastings and its division terminal at Hanover. Kansas, for a period of ninety days. During this trial period full and complete records should be kept of the revenues accruing from the motor car and also of the revenues accruing from all trains carrying pas - sengers on defendant's line in this territory. At the same time records should be kept showing in detail the expense of operation of all the passenger trains. If at the end of the trial period it is shown that the revenues from all the trains are not sufficient to compensate defendant for the operation of the additional service permission will be granted for the discontinuance of the same. </seg>

"A carrier may voluntarily accept lower rates than it can be required to accept, and whether or not a carrier will meet compe - titive conditions at a particular point rests primarily with it.

In (he discussion or the facts stated above, let us first discuss the two Interstate Commerce Commission's cases cited by the complainants and claimed to be directly in point with the issues involved in this case. In Springer v. El Paso &amp; Southwestern Railroad Company et al., decided September 17, 1909, the Commission held that, in view of the fact that the carrier had for its own convenience furnished two small cars instead of one of the capacity ordered, it was unreasonable to charge on basis of combined minimum of two cars furnished. Reparation awarded. The facts in this case, briefly stated, are: A shipment of irniture was offered the Chicago Great Western Railroad Company it Chicago, final destination El Paso, Texas. Shipper ordered a 50-foot ar. Company furnished for its own convenience one 40-foot car and one •ar of smaller dimensions. The second car contained 3,900 lbs. The shipment was delivered to the C. R. I. &amp; P. Railway Company at St. Joseph, Missouri, and cr.rried through to El Paso, Texas, by said com - pany. Total charges assessed were $280.07. Complainant demanded reparation in the amount of $46.83. The Commission in its report found that the tariffs on tile with the Commission indicate that there was no "two for one" rule in effect at the time this shipment moved. In disposing of this case. Commissioner Clements used the following puage: \ carload rate and a minimum weight for car of definite di- ti'i nsions. when lawfully published in the tariffs of the carrier, con - stitute an open offer to the shipping public to move merchandise on those terms: and there should be a rule in the tariffs to the effect that when a carrier is unable to furnish the car of size ordered and for its own convenience furnishes two cars in lieu thereof, it should do so on basis of the rate and minimum weight published in the tariffs and applicable to the car of size ordered by the ship - per. It should be wholly unsound in principle to permit the carriers to impose additional transportation charges on a shipper who orders a car of the capacity, length, or dimensions specified in its tariffs simply because the carrier is not provided with cars of dimensions ordered. The tariffs of defendants were unreasonable and unlawful in that they did not contain some provision substantially similar to the rule above stated or minimum rules such as to render un - necessary a provision of this sort." In the J. E. Watters v. C. R. I. &amp; P. Ry. Co. case, the facts arn in substance as follows: A resident of Flagler. Colorado, ordered of the C. R. I. &amp; P. Railway Company, at the above mentoined station, three double deck cars on November 17, 1913. On November 20, 1913, the said CONCLUSIONS </seg>

            <seg id="p171">NEBRASKA STATK RAILWAY COMMISSION 171 I 1 1 1 The general rule regarding the furnishing of cars of capacity or intensions other than that ordered by the shipper was in effect at the me that this shipment moved. This general rule has been supple - tented by most of the carriers operating in the state of Nebraska, providing that where single deck stock cars are turnished ci u of double deck cars that double deck rates and minimum weights be protected. The application of the general rule, however, which &gt;plies on all commodities is the same, and the specific provision in •gard to single decks furnished in lieu of double deck cars ordered properly he treated as simply being more specific. ■ I'vulHiit tliat the agent of the defendant at Alvo in this case, as as the defendant's agent at Klagler in the Watters case, was de- j ndin« upon this general rule when they notified the shippers that the &gt;uble deck rates and minimum weights would be protected by the de - ndant. even though their live stock was loaded in single deck cars. i lieu of a more specific rule there can be little question but what this -i i •-!";« 1 rule should be applied to the instant case.

            <seg id="p173">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 173 I ;i t t omplain of inadequate passenger train service on that line of the de - endant's railroad. \ hearing was held at Imperial, Nebraska, on the 18th day of No - :&gt;er, 1915, by Commissioners Clarke and Hall. The defendant is and has been operating a daily mixed train out McCook in the morning at 7:45, which arrives at Imperial at 11:06 &gt;n Wednesdays and daily except Sunday and Wednesday it arrives at niperial at 11:40 This train returns leaving Imperial at 12:50 P. M laiiy except Sunday and Wednesday and arrives at McCook at 4:30. )n Wednesday it leaves Imperial at 12:01 P. M. and arrives at McCook 25. The burden of the complaints is to the effect, first, that on ccount of the freight traffic that is handled the trains are necessarily ,ery irregular, and second, that if the trains run regularly on schedule lime the schedule is too slow, as it takes three hours and twenty ninutes to make the run on all days except Wednesday and on that lay the schedule time is three hours and fifty-five minutes. The return rip is made in three hours and forty minutes on all days except Wednesdays and on Wednesdays it is three hours and twenty-four min - utes. The evidence conclusively shows that owing to the fact that it is i mixed train the service is very irregular, and cannot be depended upon with any degree of certainty. At the conclusion of the taking of estimony at the hearing in Imperial the Commission was of the opinion that the evidence adduced would not warrant it in issuing an order directing the defendant to install and maintain a regular daily pas - senger train in addition to a daily freight train, and it concluded to i-ontinue the hearing, that further investigations might be made as to the amount of traffic handled and as to other questions involving oper - ating expenses of the trains on that line. From all the data on file with ' Commission, and from all investigations that the Commission has de, it does not feel that it would be justified in directing the defend- nt to install and maintain a daily passenger train in addition to a aily freight train on the line under consideration. The Commission ealizes. however, that the service for the passenger traffic is not ade - uate and that some steps should be taken to bring it up to a higher tandard of efficiency, and after careful consideration the Commission Mas concluded that as a tentative proposition and for the purpose of trial only, the defendant should install and maintain, for a period of at least three months, a tri-weekly passenger train, which shall leave McCook on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays at 8:00 o'clock A. M and arrive at Imperial at 10:35, leaving Imperial at 3:30 P. M. and arriving at McCook at 6:00 P. M. This will give a stop-over in Imperial of four hours and twenty-five minutes, and in each of the towns between Imperial and McCook four hours and twenty-five minutes plus the time it will take to run from each one of those towns to Imperial and back. The schedule time from McCook to Imperial will be two hours and thirty-five minutes and from Imperial to McCook two hours and thirty minutes. This will furnish a tri-weekly service that will be dependable. </seg>

E Commission realizes that this will not lake care of the coin of those witnesses who insist that for the welfare of their a daily freight train should be operated over the line nor will the experiment satisfy those who insist that a daily passenger train should be operated over the line, but as a compromise proposition it may reasonably take care of the demands of all parties and may prove K reasonably satisfactory. The Commission will not make a final in the matter until after the service proposed is tried out for a period of three months, and not in that event until after all parties have been given opportunity to be heard in the matter.

At the hearing defendant agreed to hereafter accept shipments of sand from Keithley Spur on a basis of 2,700 pounds to the cubic yard instead of 3.000 pounds. This weight being satisfactory to complainant, defendant has since filed amended tariffs covering the change and the same are now in effect. This agreement disposes of the last two grounds of the complaint, as there will be but little need for track scales, now that the freight charge is to be based on a weight satis factory to both parties. When the present rate on sand from Keithley Spur to Superior was voluntarily established by the Missouri Pacific it was published in the switching tariff of that road and the service was treated as a switching movement and not as a road haul. It is the general practice of the Missouri Pacific to assess a rental charge of $3.00 on all cars switched within the limits of any of its terminals, this being an arbitrary charge in addition to the chance fur switching. Consequently . when the Keith- </seg>

After the rate was established complainant found a market for Ml product, not only in Superior, but in quite a wide territory, and at points on other lines of railroad entering Superior The movement of the sand from Keithley Spur to Superior being regarded as a switching service by defendant, the other connecting lines followed the practice of absorb - ing the charge where the revenue to them would be not less than $15. On per car. The diversion of the traffic to other lines was objectionable to defendant and in order to force its discontinuance the rate of |5.00 for switching and $3.00 for rental was taken out of the switching tariff and placed in a tariff i Supplement No. 17 to M. P. Tariff 4778) providing rates for road hauls. This had the effect of making the $8.00 charge I road haul charge and a part of the through road haul charge from Keithley Spur to the final destination. Being no longer a switching charge, it was not absorbed by connecting lines. This had the effect of making the rates so high that complainant was unable to compete at points on other road In making the change in the ineihod of quoting the rate detendan was at fault in two particulars In the lirst place it failed to secure th approval of this Commission for the change, as the law plainly requires (Paragraph MM, Hevised Statutes IMS). The action, therefore, wa improper and Illegal. In the second place the rental charge ol $:U&gt; per car was carried out of the switching tariff and into the ro; tariff, where, under the practice of belong. When it was decided to trea instead of a switching movement th waived. In other words, the action o ing the transportation a switching n he Missouri Pacific, it do' the transportation as a roa rental charge should havi defendant had the effect ivement for the collectio c»r rental and a road haul for the purpose of preventing ronnectii lines from absorbing the switching charg In view of the fact that the change from the switching tar road haul tariff was made without the approva ■mm goes without saying that defendant should rescind its action and restore the rate to the switching tariff, even without an order of the Commis - sion. There is still a further reason, however, as to why the defendant should define the transportation as a switching movement. It has, on its own motion, denned a similar movement at Louisville as a switch ing movement. In applications Nos. SCM and 2633 it requested permis sion to publish a switching rate of |5.M per car on sand and stone from Lyman's switch to Louisville and from Woodworth's sand pit to Louis ville, the car rental being waived in each instance. The traffic is handled at Louinrllle hy a road crew, as in the case under consideration. There appears to be no distinction, therefore, between the conditions at Louisville and Superior, except that at the latter point the distance is slightly greater. It is significant, moreover, that the car rental charge is waived at Louisville, notwithstanding it is a switching movement. </seg>
            <seg id="p179">NK15KASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 179 li it. important to note at this point, also, ilial when defendant origin - ally established the rale ;it Superior it made it ;i switching rate, chang- definition only when it discovered that it was losing traffic to ines. Accepting the voluntary actions of defendant, therefore, ndication of what is a lair and practical interpretation of the nature of the service performed, we are disposed to regard the trans - portation as a switching movement and to require defendant to restore rate to its switching tariff There is but little evidence in the record concerning the reasonable- ness of the rate, although complainant protests against the combined ( harjje of $S.&lt;m&gt; as being unreasonably high. He points out that it is discriminatory as against him, for the reason that a car consigned to an industry in Superior located on another road earns but $7.00, this iimouut being made up of the $5.00 charge from Keithley Spur to Superior and the regular charge of $2.00 for switching the car to the industry, no car rental being assessed in such a case. The charge assessed when the car is placed at his industry on the Missouri Pacific is $8.00. It is to be presumed that defendant regarded the rate of $5.00 for the movement from Keithley Spur to Superior as compensatory, as it is a voluntary rate. The rates of $5.00 per car from the Woodworth and Lyman pits to Louisville are likewise voluntary rates and cover substantially the same service. It would appear, therefore, that the rate of $5.00 is reasonable. Complainant expects to turn out at least l.OOd cars this season, 500 of which will probably be consumed in Superior. It had an output of approximately 600 cars last season. It is evident, therefore, that the quantity of the traffic is such as to war - rant a low rate. No reason is advanced by defendant why the conditions at Superior require the assessment of the $3.no rental charge. If, as defendant suggests, the transportation should be regarded as a road haul, the rental charge would automatically be waived. The equipment in which sand moves is the least expensive defendant has and the waiving of the rental charge at Louisville on the same c'.ass of equipment indicates that defendant believes an exception should be made under conditions prevailing there. As we have stated, there is nothing in the record to show that conditions are substantially different at Superior. It is worthy of consideration in this connection, also, that no rental is assessed on cars delivered to industries on the tracks of connecting lines, notwithstanding such cars may be held by the shipper as long as those consigned to points on the tracks of the defendant. For these reasons the Commission is of the opinion that the car rental charge should be waived. ORDKIt IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Missouri Pacific Railway Company, Benjamin F. Bush.

While the order was intended to apply generally to all stations where there is a junction with other carriers, the com - plaint is brought by the Grand Island Commercial Club on behalf of certain shippers at Grand Island who are adversely affected. The text of the order as promulgated is as follows "The congested condition of most of our main line business sid - ings (many on its branches) and our inability to expend except at unusual expense to ourselves or annoyance to adjoining property owners, together with desire to promptly serve the industries that have located near us. justify, we think, the announcement that we cannot longer continue to accept from our connections any cars to FORMAL COMPLAINT No. 289. o Grand Island Commercial Club. 1 omplainant. - Union Pacific Railroad Co., Defendant.

The city of Grand Island is served by the Chicago, Burlington £ Quincy and the St Joseph &amp; Grand Island, in addition to the I'nion Pacific. While the St Joseph &amp; Grand Island is operated as a separate system, the majority of the stock is owned by the Union Pacific and the latter, so far as traffic matters are concerned, treats it as a part of its system. Previous to the promulgation of the order defendant received at Grand Island cars arriving over the Burlington and St. Joseph &amp; Grand Island and after switching them from the transfer tracks of point of connection, "spotted" them at points on its own tracks designated by certain shippers, no distinction being made between industry or team tracks. A charge of $2.00 per car was assessed for the switching service performed, this charge usually being absorbed by the connecting line. Following the announcement of the new practice, cars arriving over the Burlington would only be accepted by defendant vhere they could be set at an industry, on tracks provided for the exclusive service of that ndustry. Cars intended for unloading from team tracks were refused. While this complaint is brought on behalf of all the shippers served lit- Tnion Pacific, the record discloses that but two firms will be ma- erially affected by the order. There was no testimony indicating tha: my other shiopers would be seriously inconvenienced. The firms pro- sting the order are the llolan Fruit Company and the Nebraska Mer- antile Company, the one a wholesale dealer in fruu and vegetables and le other a wholesale dealer in groceries. Both occupy what is known s the Goehring building, which is located on the cast side of Wheeler avenue where that avenue opens upon defendant's right-of-way. A switch track leaves the main track about a block and a halt west of this build- and extends eastward to a point a few feet beyond the east line of building. That portion of the track directly in front of the building eferred to by defendant as an industry track, while the remainder called a team track The record is clear on the point that for at least four years past. this entire track, or so much of it as is available for cars, has been used almost exclusively by the two firms in question. In addition to having cars set at their warehouses for unloading directly on to their platforms. they have had cars placed upon the team track to be unloaded by wagon, having had as high as seven or eight cars in process of unloading at the same time. I'ntil the order complained of was issued, cars received over any of the three roads were placed on either the industry or the team track at the direction of the shippers. The practice since the order went into effect has been for defendant to set Burlington cars to the industry track, such cars taking their turn with cars received over the St. Joseph &amp; Grand Island or Union Pacific. No Burlington cars, how - ever, were set upon the team track for unloading. The contention of the Nebraska Mercantile Company and the Dolan Fruit Company is that this </seg>
            <seg id="p182">182 NINTH ANNUAL KEPOKT method of handling the cars puts them under serious disability, tor the reason that at least half of their shipments arrive over the Burlington and if they are restricted to the unloading of but two cars at a time the capacity of the warehouse track- and these cars are required to takt their turn with those received over other lines their traffic will be greatly delayed and their business injured. Mr. Coates. manager of Dolan Fruit Co., testified that the nature of the commodities handled by his firn eighty per cent, of them being perishable, makes it necessary to unload them quickly. It also frequently happens that several cars of different kinds of fruit arrive at the same time and it is of advantage to be able unload them simultaneously. 1 &gt;iu- to this method of buying a large portioi of his stock while it is in transit, it is difficult, and frequently impossible to divert it to the I'nion Pacific or the Si Joseph A; Grand Island, and hence much of it is routed into Grand Island over the Burlington. Tl team tracks of the Burlington are about one-half mile awav from t two industries, making ;&gt; wagon haul expensive and inconveniei On the other hand, defendant show;- that its terminal faciliti Grand Island have become greatly congested and that it cannot im r their rapacit) without great expense and trouble. It is necessary, t fore, to conserve as far as possible the facilities already in exist) that they may be available lo the general public without discrimina Prior to their location in Um baiMiag they now occupy had a location two blocks south and had no trackage facilitit time they unloaded their cars from the team track involv troversy. which did not extend across Wheeler avenue.

Certainly the two firms who are the real complainants in this case have been enjoying a privilegf at the hands of defendant that is denied to other shippers. It is recog nized that the nature of their business renders necessary a large amount of track facilities and that they are put to disadvantage by the enforce ment of the order involved herein. There appears to be no reason, how </seg>
            <seg id="p183">NEBRASKA STATfc RAILWAY COMMISSION 183 1 iver, why defendant should be required to provide this trackage at the ex - pense of its other patrons. It is not shown to be the fault of defendant liat the two i oik cms lack sufficient trackage. Their location in the con - gested business section of the city may have considerable to do with this ondition. I'nder the order as enforced these complainants could unload nore Burlington , a rs if they had more track room in which to place t that their warehouses are situated upon the tracks of lefendant entitle them to no greater consideration, so far as public team tracks are concerned, than is accorded to shippers not thus situated. The track in question is easily accessible to many shippers located on MMtt side of the tracks. Denied its use, they are compelled to cross &gt; main tracks and other sidings to reach the only team track available that section, necessitating a longer haul, greater danger to themselves nd their property and greater expense. This applies, of course, only to hipments consigned over defendant's line. Shipments arriving over the turlington they are compelled to unload from the latter's team tracks lalf a mile distant, whereas complainants have been having such ship - nents delivered almost at their doors. In the opinion of the Commission his ((institutes a discrimination that defendant has done well to discon - inue and which should not be revived. It defendant were to be required to open its team tracks to traffic rriving over the lines of a competitor, such a service could not be jstitied, as we have just shown, unless it was offered to all shippers ke. and this Commission could not require it unless adequate com nsation for the use of such terminals was provided. The switching te of t-"ti per car now charged does not contemplate any such use of endaut's terinina s and is intended to cover merely the reasonable • t of the physical service of transportation. The fact that oth»&gt;r car - r^ open their team tracks at other points to traffic from competing iuts is not a sufficient reason for defendant doing so in this instance. \ carrier may do voluntarily what this Commission cannot compel it to Waverly Oil Work* vs. Pennsylvania R.

Indeed, complainants con - tend that they are entitled to the use of the terminals without any other compensation than I hat included in the switching charge.

Defendant answers paragraph IV. of complainant's petition by say t "The defendant denies that said rate of 2.7 cents per hundred pounds on brick in carloads from Doniphan to Grand Island, Ne - braska, is excessive, unjust or unreasonable, and states that such rate is not in excess of what is necessary to afford this defendant reasonable compensation for such transportation services.' In support of their petition complainants offer numerous rate com - parisons on other lines of railroad showing class and commodity rates or distances approximately the same as the distance from Doniphan to Jnind Island, and undertake to justify their contention of a two-cent •ate as a reasonable rate on carload shipments of brick from Doniphan to Grand Island by citing the fact that the Burlington railroad had established commodity rates of approximately seventy-five per cent of the class "E" jobbing or distance tariff rates from certain stations to other stations on their line of railroad and that for this reason complain - ants urse that a rate of seventy-five per cent of the class "E" rate as promulgated by the Commission in its final order in General Order No. 19 should be controlling in arriving at a reasonable rate for the trans - portation of brick in carload lots from Doniphan to Grand Island. In the complainant's testimony, it was shown that the class "E" rate in General Order No. 19, Doniphan to Grand Island, is established at two and seven-tenths cents per hundred pounds and that seventy-five per cent of this rate would equal in round figures two cents.

Ike date when General Order No. 19 was &gt;lished by the Commission, the defendant had established com- l.ty rates on carload shipments of brick from Doniphan to all stations ii its line in the state of Nebraska, which were materially less than lass •■£" Nebraska distance tariff rates in effect at that time. The manu- Lirers of brick at Doniphan and Hastings paid the same rates on car- load shipments of brick to all stations on its line of railroad, Sedan and east thereof. Between Hastings, Doniphan and Sedan, the rates were somewhat higher from Doniphan, usually one-half cent per hundred pounds, than from Hastings. Defendant also had established at the time the "Railway Commission Act" became effective a rate of two Mali per hundred pounds on carload shipments of brick, minimum a eight 40.H00 pounds, Doniphan to Hastings, when destined to stations m the Hurlineton and C. &amp; N. W. lines of railway. The rate on carload shipments of brick from Hastings and Doniphan Grand Island, prior to September 6, 1914, were the same. This r»te adjustment continued up until the time when the defendant made appli - cation to the Commission to establish a class "E" rate as promulgated ii General Order No. 19 as a maximum on carload shipments of brick letween all stations on its line of railroad in the state of Nebraska. Said application became effective September 26. 1915. This had the effect of reducing the rate between Doniphan and Grand Island to two ind st veil-tenths cents per hundred pounds ass "K" two and seven-tenths cents rate established by the ommission in its General Order No. in for shipments of commodities oming imder class "E" as shown in Nebraska Classification No. 1 is provided for shipments where the distances between the point of origin and destination is eleven to fifteen miles and has been determined by the Commission to be a reasonable rate for a shipment of class "E" commodities as a general average over the entire state of Nebraska. The Commission in numerous instances, both on application by the carriers and after hearing, have ordered commodity rates established which have universally been lower than the rates provided under the distance tariff or specific jobbing class rate schedules. Testimony in this case shows that there is comparatively a heavy movement of brick from the station of Doniphan to Grand Island. This increased amount of tonnage is given consideration by the Commission in its order in this case.

            <seg id="p195">XKUKASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 195 In reaching its conclusion as to adequate depot facilities, the Com - mission should consider first, the amount of traffic to be handled at the point under consideration and the revenues received by the carriers. In doing this it immediately becomes necessary to segregate the traffic into different classes, that is, into carload, less than carload, express and passenger traffic, and the revenues received by the carriers from each of the classes. It is necessary to do this because it might be that the traffic to be handled in the main consists of carload freight and but little less than carload freight, express or passenger traffic. In that case the freight, express and passenger rooms of the depot would not have to be as large and as well equipped as if the traffic were principally made up of less than carload freight, express and passenger traffic; second, the growth and development and the probable future growth of the civic center that is the patron of the road at that point under consideration. In doing this it is necessary to consider the number, character and quality of public buildings, waterworks, lighting facilities, sanitation, paving and sidewalks, telephone facilities, etc.; the number, character and quality of business houses and residences in general and the lighting, heating and sanitary facilities installed in these places. Another element that should be considered in a general way is the size or extent of the territory which furnishes the patronage to the road at the point under considera - tion. This must be true because people that live long distances from town cannot receive goods shipped to them as promptly as those who live within a narrow radius of the depot. When the Commission has a comprehensive knowledge of the elements above set out it will be able to conclude as to the adequacy of the depot facilities to be provided by the carrier in performing its public service. The testimony shows that Franklin has an electric lighting plant, by which public buildings, business houses, residences, streets and alleys are lighted: that it at present operates to twelve P. M. but that an all - night service will be installed; that there is a modern waterworks plant. with mains extending to within one block of the defendant's depot grounds, and that the mains will be extended to the line of the depot grounds if the defendant will install water in the depot for drinking and sanitary purposes: that there are six miles of cement and brick sidewalks and crossings, and no board sidewalks or crossings. It is true that there are many old buildings in the town, but the later constructed ones are modern in their appointments and equipment, with modern con - veniences, consisting of electric light, modern heating, water and sani - tary facilities. These buildings are generally constructed of brick and cement with plate glass windows, etc. There are two banks in Franklin. The Franklin Exchange building is built of pressed brick with inlaid tile floorings, two vaults, one of which is a safety deposit vault equipped with private lock boxes for customers.

The west end of the depot is eighty- glit feet east of the east side ot the main street and only approach • (he depot. The freight room forms this end of the station. The ilafonn is MM feet long. One wing extension is 83.8 feet east of he east side of the depot. Thirty-two feet of this is brick and 151.8 eet is stone dust tilled in between curbings. The west wing extends feet west of the west end of the depot, which is to the east line of the main street. Sixty-one and two-fifths feet is stone dust filled in between curbings. The rest of the west wing and all that portion immediately in front of the depot and twelve feet across the west md is brick. The depot being located on the east side of the only ap - proach makes it necessary for all less than carload, express and pas - senger traffic to reach the depot from the west wing of the platform, and the freight and express rooms are located on this end of the depot express and less than carload freight must be handled on this west wing, over which all passenger traffic has to pass to reach the waiting room, which is on the east end of the depot, or the trains. Prom the above dimensions it will be noted that the west wing is not quite one-half the length of the east wing. The Commission is of the opinion that those portions of the platform that are filled in with stone dust should be completed or relaid with brick, thereby making the entire platform uniform. Franklin has over six miles of cement walks and crossings. The center of the town is a half mile north of the station, with splendid cement walks extending the entire distance to the depot grounds. The testimony shows that the freight room is not equipped for the purpose of storing perishable freight during cold weather, and that many times the passenger waiting room is used for this purpose to the dis - comfort and inconvenience of the public. The Commission is of the opinion that this condition should not exist. The passenger traffic needs more room than it has, without any perishable freight being stored in the waiting room. Testimony by many witnesses, uncontradicted, shows that there is such a congestion of less than carload freight and express on the west end of the platform that passengers cannot get to the depot and trains </seg>

The City of Beaver City, Complainant, vs Beaver City Telephone Exchange, a Partner - ship, owned by Gaddis &amp; Ellis, unincor - porated, Defendants. \ppearances •"or Complainant. .1. B. Smith. City Attorney, and John Stevens, Attorney. Mir I&gt;efendants. J K. h'ults and Lambe &amp; Butler, Attorneys. ORDER Taylor, Commissioner Gaddis &amp; Ellis, a partnership, operate a telephone system at Beaver City, under the name of the Heaver City Telephone Exchange. The com - plaint is to the effect that defendant should be required to give con- linuous, twenty-four-hour service, and that the service should be ma - terially improved. In answer defendant admits that it furnishes a limited service at night and on Sunday, but alleges that the service during other hours is efficient. It further alleges that the present revenues are not sufficient to justify a more extended service and prays that if the Com- lission finds such service to be necessary that defendant be permitted in increase its rates to the extent of 40 cents per subscriber per month, with a discount of 15 cents per subscriber per month for prompt payment. Subsequent to the hearing defendant moved to amend its answer by apply - ing definitely and without condition for the increase of rates as just out- lined. This motion was denied by the Commission on the ground that the issue* as presented by the pleadings at the time of the hearing involved only the question of the adequacy of the service under the present rates and that a finding as to the reasonableness of increased rates could only be made after a much more extended investigation. The issue to be determined, therefore, is as to whether the present service is adequate, considering the rates paid. Reaver City is a town of the second class, with a population of about l.:!uO. The telephone exchange involved in this proceeding was originally built in 1904. by A. Gaddis. of the present firm of Gaddis &amp; Ellis, and in the year 1908 \V. F. Ellis purchased a half interest. It serves at the present time 50fi subscribers, divided among the various classes as fol - lows: Business, 47; residence, 164; farm, 287; desk, 8. The system within the limits of Beaver City is all metallic and with but a very few exceptions, each subscriber is served by an individual Une, there being no party lines in the town.

Is not a subscriber now. Said phone appeared to be out of order and he could not get it fixed, although he complained fre - liiently and both Gaddis and Ellis tried to put it in repair. A. Uaddis. called on behalf of complainants, testified as to the toil charges between Heaver City and neighboring exchanges, stating that no free service between exchanges is given except a one-way service from Cambridge to Beaver City and from a certain number of subscribers of the exchange at Hendley.

He can talk to any exchange that is open on S^rnuay. I have put calls from here to Lincoln on Sunday and to probably iwemv - flTe or thirty or forty different towns in Kansas: 1 have put mils- up the line as far as I could go on Sunday and east as far as I could go on Sunday and they always answered during open hours." Questioned as to the application of an additional charge of 25 cents for calls put through during closed hours, he said: "No additional charge to it. There never has been an additional charge collected at our office that I know of. 1 call to mind right now where some three different charges have been assessed for calls that came in after In o'clock at night where it was a call for us to go out and hunt people around town and we made a chars* 3 of 25 cents — I made a charge of 25 cents and collected it. * * * We reserve that privilege (assessing a charge I for unnecessary calls. Often calls will be made by young people who get home and want to know when someone else has got home, something of that kind, and we arrange for a charge of twenty-five cents, and for such a call as that we can charge it but to the best of my knowledge we never tried to collect one • • • There never has been a time since the opening of the office m the present day but what we have always claimed we were on the job give necessary calls any hour in the night. All m wou answered, doctor's or otherwise, but all foolishness would he M from 10 o'clock at night until fi o'clock in the morning. Through thf vest season our phone is at work at t:M in the morning and we close the office until 11 o'clock at night.' Testifying on behalf of the company. W. F. Kllis explained the method of operation at night. An operator, usually himself or Mr Gaddis. sleeps in a room immediate \ off of the switchroom. A gong is attached to the switchboard, which rings when signal is given by suti scriber and continues to ring until disconnected, (alls during nigln run from none at all to two or three. Mr. Kllis said that to his know! edge some calls had been missed but that the number would not exceed five or six during the time he had been on duty. Three operators are hired for day service, one having been in the employ of the company for nine years, another seven years and the third one year. The third operator was added about a year ago at the time the switchboard was increased by the addition of one section. E)n this record the Commission i* of the opinion that the service being rendered by defendant is adequate tor the rates charged above the average in efficiency for exchanges of this character. n but twelve out of a total of r&gt;tio subscribers served by the tnge can recall less than twenty-five instances in a period of years when they could not get service either at night or on Sun - day during the closed hours, and when practically each one of the twelve admitted that during the same period he had been able to put calls through during the closed hours, it is apparent that the company is </seg>

"P '»• 1&gt; iiilcs in a substantial manner A telephone system is a lechanical device and like all mechanical devices will at tiroes get ut of order. It is apparent from the testimony of comp ainant s wit- ver. that defendant has been diligent in its attempt to iv. &gt;er\ ii ice. The fact thai it recently went to the expense of putting ires within the town underground and also increased the capacity of its switchboard and added another operator indicates a iesire to keep ;ihre;ist of the demands for service. The financial show- ing made by the company is conclusive that under the present revenue it would be impossible to give a more extended service. The rates in effect are below the average for exchanges of this size and character. Tile rates in effect &gt;1 neighboring exchanges, referred to by complain itnts. are as follow Town Arapahot Kdison Hendley Holbrook Oxford In each instance the farm line rate at these exchanges is twenty five cents higher than at Beaver City, the residence rate is twenty-live cents higher in two instances and the business rate twenty-five cents higher in two instances, and fifty cents in one instance. In this con - nection it should be borne in mind that with possibly the exception of Oxford the number of subscribers are less in each case than are served by Beaver City. Moreover, each of these exchanges has closed hours -imilar to the schedule ill effect at Beaver City. A limited service, such as is furnished by defendant, is admittedly not as satisfactory as a continuous twenty-four hours service for seven days in the week, but telephone service is much like everything else, the quantity furnished has a great deal to do with the price charged. The patrons of this exchange are paying a low rate and they should expect a less extensive service than is furnished patrons of other com - panies who are paying higher rates. So long as defendant is giving efficient service during the hours provided under its rules, complain - ants cannot be heard to demand a more extended service unless they indicate a willingness to pay a rate that will cover the increased expense.

In order that the Commission might be fully advised and all inter - sted parties be Riven a chance to be heard, the Commission held a hearing at its offices at the Capitol building on November 26, 1915. at which hearing on the application of the applicants herein the city of Lincoln was represented by the city attorney. In support of the company's contention that the rate of -Mi cents per kilowatt hour should be reduced, certain tabulations, purporting to show the coat of furnishing electric current at the power house, were submitted by the company. The method adopted for presentation of the kilowatt cost was practically the same formula that was adopted by the Com - mission's experts at the time the 2V4-cent rate was established. The company submitted figures for the calendar years 1912, 1913, and 1914. For the year 1912 they show an average operating cost of 2.1446 cents per kilowatt hour, for IMS, LM cents per kilowatt hour, and for 1914. 2.01 cents per kilowatt hour. h was coiitcnili'd by Mir compan) thai I lie total kilowatt output ol the plant for the year 1!M4 was less than the actual kilowatt hours produced, by reason of the registering meter, used to register the kilo- APPLICATION NO. 22C2 </seg>

We fully appreciate the importance of rriving at a charge for the services furnished to these two depart - nents which may be as nearly correct as possible. In the establish nent of the l! 1^ cents per kilowatt charge, every expense incurred, i. e.. lirect operation, complete maintenance and depreciation of the power ilant, including buildings and appliances, together with return on the nMstnient, was reflected in the charge established. The only thing indetermined at that time was whether or not the amount of depre&gt; i.i ion reserve which the Commission established would be sufficient to ully maintain the power plant at 10n' t cost value of the plant at le time the charge was established. The greatest period of time iat can be covered in an investigation will usually give the most ccurate information as to the cost of maintaining a given property, he variation in the cost of fuel and the necessary' repairs to keep he plant at 100 r ; efficiency may vary materially between different ears. It would therefore be unfair to take a short period of time in which is established a constant rate or charge. This is espe - ially true where the operations of the utility will allow an examination the results of operation for a longer period of time. It is shown ii Mr. Powell's Kxhibit "K." which rovers the results of operating the lower plant from February 1. 1909. to July 1, 1!U5, the average cost ler kilowatt hour. — using the same formula that was adopted by the ommission's representative at the time the 2V4 cents per kilowatt harge was established, — is 2.L'1T rents per kilowatt, while Exhibit ""E" — vhich shows the results of operating the power plant for twelve months nding July 30, 191."&gt;- shows the average cost on the same basis as M cents per K. \V.

            <seg id="p219">NKHRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 219 The above mentioned report shows that the total number of kilowatt hours consumption in the light and power departments is increasing materially faster than the consumption of current in the railway department. The number of kilowatts furnished to the light nd power department for the four years is shown to be as follows It appears from the above that for the fiscal year ending June 30. 1H15. the amount of current furnished to the light and power depart - ment increased approximately 27'. over the number of kilowatt hours furnished tor the fiscal year ending June 30. 1912. while the railway department increased but 12',. It would, therefore, appear that any increase in the capacity of the power plant would be made necessary by reason of the current furnished to the light and power department. It is understood that the company is making no effort to increase its number of patrons in the heating department. While the plant as it is maintained at the present time is ample to furnish the current for the railway, light and power departments, there is little doubt but that the time is fast approaching when there will have to be material increases in the kilowatt capacity output. When this time does come — by reason of changes in the type of equipment — there may be a material obsolescent feature to be cared tor in the plant. Whether or not the maintenance reserve which is being accumulated will be sufficient remains to be proven. The Commission, in making the rate to be charged for the cur - rent to the light and power department, desires to make the same as nearly correct as may be. It does not desire to establish a charge t hat will allow the railway department to make a profit off of the current furnished the commercial light and power department in excess »f the amount actually necessary to pay al! operation, maintenance. and depreciation charges and a fair return on that portion of the property which is devoted to the production of electric current and steam heat. At the same time the Commission does not want to put any burden on the railway department by reason of that department having to furnish steam heat and electric current to subsidiary departments of the corporation. In our supplemental order in Formal Complaint No. 4:!, issued August 7, 1912. we called attention to the fact that the 2&gt;« cents per K.

This issue was supplemental to an original issue of $125,000 of first mortgage bonds and $75,000 of common stock, approved by this Commission August 19, 1913. i Application No. 1833.) On May tt, 1915. app Want filed a petition asking for a modifica - tion of the order of February 6. 1M15, in so far as the same applied to the amount approved.

The modification is prayed for mainly on the ground that the order does not permit applicant to issue bonds and stock in an amount sufficient to represent the actual cost anil value of the property in service. A hearing on the amended application was held in the offices of the Com - mission on June 7. 1915. The history of the company and its general tinancial condition were discussed in the opinion and order now under consideration, and it is only necessary here to consider the specific points raised by this petition. • In a consideration of the amount of money expended for the con - struction involved in this application, the Commission said: "The accounting department in its report shows that a much greater amount of money has been spent by the applicant, but the accounts of the applicant are so intermingled with properties that have been constructed in Iowa and accounts that are not properly chargeable to working capital, that it is impossible almost to segre - gate the items and determine just how much should be charged to capital to said accounts " </seg>

We would have to get in in the spring, and we figured, and we figure now, that if we had the same condition confronting us again, we would do the same thing. We think we acted wisely in getting it in there and getting the construction finished as promptly as possible." The testimony of Arthur Huntington. superintendent in charge of onstruction, is supplemental to that of Mr. English on this poin n answer to the question as to the reason for the winter construct on. m said : "The large amount of business in that locality is stone quarries and sand pits, and we went into the construction know.ng that we would have to be able to supply at least three hundred or four hun - dred horsepower current to people already under contract not later than March 1st. and all our contracts were made to cover March 1st The property was secured, if I recollect rightly, in August, and a'l the engineering and surveying had to he done and it was p acti - rally the first of October before we got started. The first poles arrived on the ground on the Xth day of October." Hi' adds those sand pits, more particularly than the stone quar- ries, are fixed for one class of operation and you cannot interff re w.th that operation for any length of time during the entire season, and it takes quite a while to connect up one of those sand pits, and If we did not connect them up by March 1st there would be no show of get tint: them until a year from that date." Another company was building into the field and there was som • rivalry as to which could deliver current first. This undoubted y In - fluenced applicant to some extent in pushing the construction under nnlavorable conditions. It is contended, however, that because of the mechanical obstacles referred to and the necessity of getting into the field in the spring, the power contracts could not have been secured •■xcept upon the condition that delivery of current be guaranteed hy March 1st. and that that was the prime motive for hurrying the work. it- management regarded the extra expenditure as a good investment in view of the fact that it assured an early consumption of current and a quicker earning for the portion of the plant thus placed in service. The increased cost of construction, occasioned by weather condition*, in the judgment of the company, was preferable to a postponement to i; more favorable season when the result of such postponement would be the sacrifice for several months and perhaps permanent y of a sub - stantial revenue that would accrue from large consumers. The com - pany was confronted with two alternatives, either wait for the summer months when it could build at normal cost, sacrificing the immediate revenue to be secured, or. expend more money in immediate construc - tion and secure earnings at once. The management considered the problem thus presented and concluded to proceed at once with the </seg>
            <seg id="p226">226 NINTH AXNTAI, UFI'OUT i 'iiiiKlriirliiin. That ils fort-siclil «;is rewarded is evidenced l._\ tin - increased earnings that followed the completion of the line into l.ouis ville in February. For the six months preceding February. 1W14, the average revenue from the sale of electric current was approximate &gt; S600 per month. In February it increased to $1.1129.86 and by June had reached $1,937.52. Practically all of the increase came from the patrons served by the new line. The results justify the conclusion that the company exercised reasonable business judgment. Having done so, it is entitled to an allowance in securities lor the money thus actually expended. A few items cited by Mr. Huntington show that the winter con struction was more expensive than would have been the case had tlu work been done during the summer months. For example, the cross ing at the Platte river cost more because of interference from higl water and ice. In the estimate of Mr. Forbes the concrete work wt this crossing was fixed at $7.oO per cubic yard. The figures kept nj Mr. Huntington showed the actual cost to be $9.94 per cubic yard making a difference in this item of $1,546. The excavation at this point ran above the normal for such work on account of quicksand cost just double the amount per cubic yard allowed by Mr. Foi The cost of setting poles was also materially increased from the &gt; cause. An item that was not affected by winter construction but w] from the nature of a physical valuation, did not enter into Mr Fo: figures, was the bridge toll at the Platte river for the employees eng in the work. This was between $6(10 and $l."0fl. These figures, i but a small part of the total, indicate the nature ot the extra exp to which applicant was put in the construction of this line. The pany has vouchers for each item of expenditure, and it is possihi ascertain the purpose for which all the mone\ was expended, tl&gt; not necessary for the purposes of this opinion. Another element of cost that is peculiar to this cas A in line with the policy of the company to .secure a quick development of the property, was the expenditure made to secure customers. The plan was to do the necessary house wiring at less than cost and iiistaU the equipment in order to give the prospective consumer a practical demonstration of the convenience and advantages of electricity. This was more expensive than the usual method of solicitation but it secured mm h quicker results. For instance, in Greina. a town of less than five hun - dred people, the company connected with 123 light, heat and power customers in less than ninety days. Tnder the usual methods it might have been many months in securing an equal number. Again, the com - pany expended more money but got quicker returns, with a resultant benefit to the property. With respect, therefore, to the legitimacy of the actual expendi Hires for construction the Commission is of the opinion, and so t'md- </seg>
            <seg id="p227">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 227 that the $129,31)7.81 was reasonably required for the purpose for which it was expended and that applicant should be permitted to issue capital securities therefor. Applicant contends that it should be allowed approximately $8,000 nterest during the period of construction. This sum, less $971. 90. nterest actually paid, is arrived at by applying 6', to $127,628.23 for me half the period from August 1, 1913, to December 1, 1914, and on the entire sum from the latter date until June 1, 1915. Had applicant secured no revenue from operation this would be a legitimate ailow- . at least in an amount sufficient to cover the investment during period of construction. It is apparent, however, that applicant -hould not be permitted to capitalize extra construction expense, made or the specific purpose of securing immediate revenue, and at the same ime he authorized to capitalize interest for the full period oi con- ruction, particularly that portion of the period after it commenced to ■ceive revenue. In other words, "it cannot have its cake and eat it The revenue thus produced was sufficient to pay a portion of nterest charges. It would be proper and fair, perhaps, to allow interest from August I, 1913. to February, 1914. the date upon which service was commenced to new customers, provided the amount of the investment up to that time could be ascertained. Applicant has made mi showing, however, as to the specific amount of money expended during that period, and in the absence of such information it is impos - sible to determine what the amount should be. As to the interest for period from December 1, 1914, to June 1. 1915, claimed on account he fact that securities had not been issued although the invest ent had been made, the same objection applies as is presented in mien ion with the claim for interest for the entire construction period. The plant was in operation all this time and producing revenue, perhaps not sufficient to return a profit on the investment, but enough, at least, to defray the fixed charges. The Commission is therefore of the opinion that no allowance for interest should be, approved at this time In the original ordw the sum of $8,670.74 was allowed for work niK capital. This amount was arrived at by adding to the item of *::.l!S6.44. the allowance made by Engineer Forbes for stores and sup - plies, .V, ol the base figure of $107.68604. As the account covering stores and supplies is the confusing factor in applicant's relations to its Iowa properties it is thought best not to include this in the allow - ance for working capital. As in former cases, a straight allowance of ."&gt;', on the cost of the property will be approved, making the amount tor this purpose $6.465 3!*. Adding this amount to $129,307.81 we have $13.'&gt;, 773.20, to which should be added 15', for the cost of financing, this being the allowance for this purpose found reasonable in the former order.

At the outset the association was a smelly co-operative or mutual organization and service was restricted io stockholders. As the system developed it was found impracticable in require the purchase of stock by every prospective subscriber to the service and the rules were changed to permit of the rental of telephones within the towns. For a short time a small number of telephones were rented to farm line users, but this practice was soon abandoned, and the rule with reference to the ownership of stock being prerequisite i o securing service was enforced upon farm patrons. At the present time, therefore, all farm patrons are owners of stock in the association </seg>

It was explained that i&lt; hided in the expenditures for that year were a number of items for nprovements and- betterments, so that the figures would not reflect the dual operating conditions. As to the need for increased revenue, J. L. Evans, manager of company, states it has always been the policy to use any surplus eniaining attar actual operating expenses have been paid to build • nch new property as the demands of normal development require. As consequence no rash surplus for depreciation has been accumulated d now when replacements and reconstruction are necessary money as to be borrowed for the purpose. He admits that a considerable mount of property has been built out of revenues, and thinks the com- ianv has been too liberal in that policy, for the reason that the plant become larger than can be maintained under present revenues. the poles in service is at. out ten years and a large averse uer of them will have to be replaced within a short time. This involve ;i substantial expenditure of money for which there is no vision at the present time. During the winter of 1914-15 a severe :&gt;( storm broke down many ines in UM northern part of the county. l the reconstruction of these lines it was tound advisable to install able in the town of Maniuette. The repairs and necessary improre- inents had to be paid for out of money borrowed by the company, no other funds being available. It is this experience, and the increasing knowledge that the physical part of the property has reached the point where large expenditures will shortly be necessary, that prompts the management to ask for more revenue. It is expressly stated that none of the added revenue is to be used to pay dividends or to pay In - creased salaries. In this connection it should be said that the record shows the company to be very economically managed.

The record shows conclusively, however, that the company has been perated in a most economical manner: that it started as a quasi mutual oncern. the stockholders, particularly in the earlier periods, contributing mall amount in labor, etc., to the construction of the property; that donations, the amount of which is not shown, were made by citizens who favored an independent exchange, but for fear of its ultimate failure refused to become stockholders; that in order to induce the farmers to become subscribers and stockholders in the company, their stock was treated as preferred: that only six per cent dividends have been paid said stock; that the remaining s'ock received no dividends in the first ;irs of the company's operations. The president of the company testified that, as nearly as he could ■stimate. the total dividends paid would not for the entire life of the ompany exceed on the average 4^', . The foregoing history accounts for the margin in property value ver and above capital liabilities. We do nor deem it necessary for the purposes of this case to make a physical valuation of the plant, inasmuch s tin- consolidation and underground work will when completed neces - arily produce a property quite different from the existing plant. Fur- lennore. the rates applied for correspond or are less than the rates ltt;tining in exchanges of like size and proposed standard. Again, it is the history of such consolidation that an appreciable ncrease in traffic immediately follows, and that the public is more criti- of the service than under competitive conditions. This will involve the employment of additional operators and linemen. pic., and by reason of the greater efficiency of the operators required, a possible increase in the present salaries. An examination of the present salary list, including the general officers, is convincing as to the economi - cal manner in which the al'airs of the applicant have been conducted. ami supports their contention that it is confronted with a material increase in operating expense. This increase, applicant estimates will aggregate M.WMI, We believe that C3.5UO.00 will be ample. Applicant's method of fariii line operation is for the stockholders on each line to elect a line supervisor, who is in charge of the maintenance and upkeep of the line. These supervisors have unanimously recom - mended that the present rate of $1 nil per month be increased to $1.25.

In addition the switched farm lines have connection with applicant's exchange at Pleasant Dale, no extra charge being as sessed for this service. The charge for switching service is twenty-five cents per subscriber per month. The application is to increase this charge to fifty cents per month. In support of its application the telephone company submits itemized tatements of all expense incurred in the operation of the exchanges at Seward and Milford. From these statements a summary was pre - pared and submitted for the record, calculated to show the actual expenses properly chargeable to the switching service, this summary being as follows: </seg>

It is the practice of this Commission to consider naintenance and depreciation as one account and to make an allowance or !i . on the value of the prop- My for the two purposes. It is perience of the Commission that an S', allowance for maintenance ?preciation is sufficient in plants 01 this kind, particularly on thai of the plant known as central pffice equipment. The allowance of is interest is considered reasonable and will be approved in this ance. The item of $i;!2 for use of circuits from central office to city ts covers the cost of maintenance and the rental of the lines and is p on a basis of $1.00 per month for each circuit. There are eleven at each exchange. This charge dors not appear to be arge for directory expense no allowance is made for the derived from the sale of advertising in the directories. The com- Is that the purpose here is to ascertain the actual coat of ating the exchange and that the revenues are not to be considered in lat view of the matter, however, overlooks the fact inecti ibscrib.rs furnished with a directory contribute in a measure to ihe revenue which the directory produces. In theory at least the price of .idvertising is based on the number of telephone users to whom the direc- tory is distributed, there being no distinction between subscribers and switched patrons. The charge made to switched patrons is presumed to cover the expense ot furnishing them with directories. That being true, they are entitled to pay only the net cost of the directories to the com panv and have as much right to n deduction by reason of advertising revenue as the company's subscribers. The company readily concedes that the advertising receipts are properly a part of the gross earnings of the company and so includes them in iis statement of revenue and ex - penses in this ease. It would be proper, according to the company, to take this advertising revenue into account in a case to determine the reasonableness of the exchange rates as a whole at Milford and Seward. To do so, however, and at the same time deny the benefit of the revenue </seg>

In exp:anation of the apportionment of the expenses to the switched subscribers, it should be said that with but two or three exceptions the apportionment is made on the subscribers' station basis. There being 93 switched stations out of a total of M0 stations on the Seward exchange. an even ten per cent of the expenses for that exchange were charged against the switched patrons. At Milford there are 128 switched patrons out of a total of 453. or approximately twenty-eight per cent. Except where it is possible to directly allocate the expense to the switched patrons, as in the case of the use of the circuits from the central office to the city limits, the division on the basis of the subscribers' stations appears to be about as fair as any method that can be selected.

In the report in the above mentioned case the Commission states: ' It has long been the claim of the carriers that the amounts mid by them for loss and damage incident to the transportation of live stork are disproportionately high as compared with the loss and damage claims incident to the transportation of other freight. t does not appear, however, that all such claims are affected by these particular contracts A large proportion — perhaps 85', in amount s on account of loss of market and incidental shrinkage in weights and value of the live stock. Such losses never do and never can equal the valuations named in the contract Only about 15^ of the otal claims paid by the carriers for loss of or injury to live stock are therefore in any way affected by the rules and regulations her" n issue. The amount of money actually paid by these defendants &gt;ecause of such loss or injury does not average more than 25 cents per car." Ijve stock moving on commodity rates in Nebraska iutrastate traffic will no doubt be about the same as the general average of live stock shipments considered bj the Interstate Commerce Commission in ihe above mentioned case. With the fact before us that but 15', of the claims for damas-'es on shi actual injury or loss in transit, it sideration should be gixen to the the Nebraska constitution "the li; common carriers sha'l never be 1 sented is, what shall the rate be on live stock by shippers This i :t4, being Supplement No. ti to N» lished the values and percentages - declared valuations for live stock carload rates and under the Class mentioned order it was provided than »8«0.on per head would lie I sideration in this application, whit intrastate live stock shipments, do of live stock of values more than hipments of live stock comes fron it is evident that very careful con e question herein presented.

If in the investigation of such laim it was developed that the live stock was undervalued, then in tiat case the freight charges would be based on the values developed by vestigation in the fina! settlement of the claim In the consideration of ihe application herein the Commission recog - /.es that it is advantageous to the carriers as well as the shippers have the rules governing interstate and intrastate shipments as arlv the same as possible. There is one matter, however, presented n the application which the Commission is of the opinion would be i.nefited by a change in the general plan of declaring the valuation i carload shipment of live stock. It will be noted in paragraph of the application that it is proposed that on live stock of varying allies loaded in one car the rate to be assessed will be that applicable i) the highest valuation on any one individual animal that may be taded in the car. I'nder this rule a carload shipment of hogs con - aining sixty animals, weighing an average of 2&lt;&gt;0 pounds, and one ■■ weighing 400 pounds, the declared valuation under the rule as roposed in the application would he based on the 400-pound hog. This n the mind of the Commission is hardly fair and reasonable to the ihippers of live stock. It appears to the Commission, and we so find, that a more equitable •ule should be provided whereby the average value of the entire arload would be used as a basis for ascertaining the average declared .alue per head per car. We of course recognize the fact that the •arrier might be called upon to pay for the loss of the 400-pound hog nentioned in the illustration set out above, but in view of the fact hat under the constitution of this state the carriers cannot limit heir liability in any event, it would appear that a more reasonable uid just rule would be provided it the average of the entire carload a us used as a basis for the valuation. In consideration of all of the larying conditions surrounding the traffic, the Commission is of the opinion, and so finds, that the following provisions should be e»tab - shed on intrastate shipments of live stock by the carriers operating n this state: VALUATION OF LIVE STOCK (a) The rates named in this tariff, supplements thereto and re - issues thereof, are based upon variable values of Live Stock offered for shipment, as shown in this item. (b) Carriers have no means of determining values of live stock when offered for shipment, and live stock will not be accepted for transportation unless the shipper or bis agent declares in writing the estimated average value at time and place of shipment.

It shows that cars are being de tained for storage and unloading varying from five to 159 days. The testimony also shows, — which is admitted generally by the shippers, — that it is a general practice to store other perishable freight in the cars, that was not shipped in the car for storage purposes. To illustrate, a consignee removes a part of the contents of a car covers! by the original bill of lading and then fills up the space with other perishable freight for storage purposes. 8 Although it is not in the record, as the data has been secured by Commission since the hearing, the Commission gives the following nits of the study of one car in particular that the actual practice y be more fully illustrated: tP. F. E. 4%8, containing shipment of 120 crates of cabbag". by L. A. Kinney, consigned to Dolan Kruit Company, ami by Hastings-Grand Island waybill 376. April 26th. reached Island April 27th. On May imh an inspection of the car ide and it was found that it had been re-iced the second time / 9th and that at the time of the inspection. May luth. it contained 35 crates of cabbage. 28 crates of strawberries, li baskets of radishes, one barrel of radishes, one basket of lettuce. This practice should be discouraged. The so-called tree time for loading and unloading is covered by the transportation rate. The demurrage charge is no part of the rate and is not for revenue, but is charged for the purpose of encouraging consignors and consignees to load and unload the cars with dispatch, to the end that carriers may secure the greatest efficiency in mileage out of the equipment at their disposal. Cars are for transportation and not for storage. The Commission is of the opinion, and so finds, that the charge of $1.00 per car per day for detention of cars beyond the free time is not accomplishing the thing desired, i. e, the unloading within a reasonable time after free time. The Commission is also of the opinion, and so finds, that although the statutes above quoted provide for free time of but thirty-six hoars on cars of less than 60,000 capacity, the free time on such cars should be increased to forty-eight hours, and the same statute </seg>

The Commission is of the opinion, and so imls. that this charge should be authorized.

This practice, particularly it indulged in frequently to any extent, would justify the applicant in removing the instrument and refusing service.

By the Commission This matter came on for hearing before the Commission on an appli - ation on behalf of the Lincoln Gas &amp; Electric Light Company filed April M, 1916. In said petition the applicant asks for an order from the Com - mission to sell $733,000.00 of said Lincoln Gas &amp; Electric Light Company's first consolidated mortgage, five per cent, forty year gold bonds, secured by a mortgage of the company to the Trust Company of America (The Equitable Trust Company of New York, successor), being a part of an authorized issue of first consolidated mortgage, five per cent, forty year mild bonds in the total amount of $1,500,000.00. dated December 1, 1901. During the course of the hearing the applicant amended its petition to read "authority to issue $703,400.00 and authorization to sell $733,000.00 of its consolidated first mortgage, five per cent forty year gold bonds. The petition shows that the proceeds of the sale of $733,000.00 of first con - solidated mortgage five per cent bonds are needed for the purpose of the redemption, retirement and cancellation of the $500,000.00 three year six per cent coupon gold notes authorized by this Commission as of date July 1. 11*14, and for the further purpose of the payment of certain bills payable, the proceeds from which have been used for betterments and additions to the company's plant, and for the further purpose of the construction of additions and betterments already contracted for or contemplated. At the hearing a report was submitted by Mr. U. G. Powell, ac - countant for the Commission. Said report sets forth the results of operation of the applicant from July 1, 1914. to March 31. 1916. The re - port also includes a complete statement of the assets and liabilities of the company as of March 31, 1916.

This question of liability of repayment to Lincoln citizens will be re - tained and kept under careful supervision by the Commission, and may be the subject of future hearing and order by the Commission after the opinion and order of the United States Supreme Court has been entered in the case now pending. In the granting of the prayer of the applicant herein, the decision of 'he Commission has not been influenced by the book cost of the property as carried in the balance sheet of the company, neither has the Commis - sion felt the need of going to the expense of requiring the engineering de - partment of the Commission to make a physical valuation of the property E applicant. If the ability of the company to sell the bonds herein rized at eighty-six cents on the dollar is realized, there will be ble a gross sum of 1630,380.00. Of this amount $500,000.00 will be required to refund the three year six per cent gold notes now outstand - ing and authorized by the Commission. This will leave $130,380.00 avail - able for the payment of short time notes, the proceeds of which have been used for the betterments and additions added to the company &gt; plant July 1. 1914. to April 1. 1916. in the amount of $70,852.91. and a balance of $59,527.09 available for the betterments and additions now in process of construction or contemplated and which are needed for the proper conduct of the growing business of the company. The balance. of approximately $10,000.00, above the actual additions to the property now being placed in the company's plant, will be expended as directed by the Commission after sufficient evidence has been submitted before the Commission that other betterments or additions are needed by the applicant. In the opinion of the Commission it is quite important that the $500,000.00 of three year six per cent gold notes due August 1. 1H17. be properly provided for at as early a date as possible before the date of Bturlty, and it is to be desired that the needs of the applicant be financed as low-bearing long time securities as can be negotiated. Vn the petition the applicant asks the Commission to authorize the of the security herein allowed at a discount of not less than fight &gt; two cents on the dollar. During the hearing an affidavit, heretofore men - tioned, was introduced in evidence. In said affidavit it is shown that under present, bond market conditions the securities herein authorized may be sold at a figure of not more than eighty-six cents on the face value of the bonds. The Commission is willing to assist the applicant in properly financ - ing its property in so far as the actual needs of the company may appear. However, the Commission is of the opinion that the earning power and net operating income of the applicant above all operating expenses, taxes and an ample maintenance charge against current revenues justifies a </seg>

The fixed charges of the company, including the bonds herein allowed. will be $1, 500.00o.00, bearing five per cent per annum, which will require st.'.'poii.imi as an annual interest charge.

The Commission is therefore of the opinion, and so finds, that eighty - six cents is the minimum price at which the bonds herein authorized shall lie sold. If it should finally develop that said bonds can not be dis- posed of at the limit figure here found, the applicant may make applica - tion to the Commission for a further consideration of this portion of this From the testimony introduced and the facts submitted for the Com- mission's consideration, the Commission is of the opinion, and so finds, that the prayer of the petitioner should be granted and the same be au- thorized to issue $703,400.00 of said Lincoln Gas &amp; Electric Light Com - pany's first consolidated mortgage five per cent forty year gold bonds, same bearing a payable date as of December 1, 1941. The Commission is further of the opinion, and so finds, that the prayer of the applicant should be granted to sell the $703,400.00 of iU first consolidated mortgage five per cent forty year gold bonds above mentioned, together with the $2»,£00.u0 heretofore mentioned, at a price which will net the company not less than eighty-six per cent of the face value of the bonds so sold, plus accrued interest from the last interest date. At the time of hearing, representatives of the company were asked whether or not they would be willing to file with the Commission copies of the monthly statement rendered by the Lincoln Gas &amp; Electric Light Company to the Ooherty Operating Company, being a complete monthly report of the financial standing and operation accounts, subdivided as between gas and electric light, and it appearing to the Commission that said reports are necessary for the proper supervision of the affairs of the applicant, the Commission is of the opinion, and so finds, that the appli - cant should be required to file with the Commission, not later than thirty days after the date for which the report is made, a complete </seg>

It is shown by the monthly report of the applicant, page KIT in Exhibit "A" of the report introduced by the accountant for the Commission, that there is yet to be accumulated from the earniaai oi the company for the purpose mentioned above the amount of $10,416.76, in addition to the amount just mentioned, and following the same general plan in the authorization of the sale of $733,000.00 issue of tirst con solidated mortgage five per MM bonds, an amortization fund should be created.

Later it was decided to submit ad.li tional testimony on the points in disagreement and a final hearing was held on September 19th. 1916. In the first place, it is contended by the applicant that its existing lines having been operated at 22,000 volts for a time altar their original construction, they are. so far as the transmission line law is concerned 22,000-volt lines and that this Commission has no jurisdiction under the said law, over the restoring of the raMaca on these lines to 'J^.

The Commission finds that for some time past these lines have been operated as a regular and normal method of operation at a voltage of 13,200, and is of the opinion that they sho'ild lie c onsidered as 13.200 volt lines and that increasing the rattan to 22.

Subsequent to the entering of said order the accounting depart nent of the Commission, to-wit, on July 1, 1916, filed its rfeport, which onttrms the report of the engineering department and in addition thereto -hows that after applying the proceeds of the sale of said $25,000.00 of stock heretofore authorized to the payment of bills payable in the sum nf $19,000.00 and accounts payable in the sum of $6,000.00, there still remains $8,600.00 of unpaid bills payable. The report further shows that the $34,364.29 of depreciation reserve shown in the engineer's report had not been accumulated in the form of liquid assets, but had been expended very largely, if not entirely, in additions and betterments; that the rapid growth of population and the development of the territory will necessitate continued additions and betterments to the plant; that the realized depreciation by reason of the age of the plant as a whole has been below normal and will in - crease from this time on until the normal is reached, and that as a result the depreciation fund should be reimbursed from capital account the extent that it has been drawn on for additions and betterments. The report further shows in detail the estimated requirements of the applicant at its various exchanges for reconstruction and new construction aggregating $54,300.00. The Commission, upon consideration of the said reports and being fully advised in the premises, finds that the issuance of $25,000.00 of stock in addition to that heretofore authorized is reasonably required for the purposes provided in the statutes and should be allowed.

Th tral exchange was operated originally by the farmers, but was eventually sold to the present company. Until spring of the present year there were two exchanges in Curtis, the other being owned by the Mooretield Farm &amp; Ranch Telephone Company.

            <seg id="p339">r i I i y The above figures, of course, do not take into account the additional ivestment occasioned by the purchase of the Moorefield property. The ecord indicates that all of this property will not be used, at least for ■ present. It was stated by Mr. Sibley. who is secretary and treasurer the company, that the greater portion of the property will be used but hat it will be two or three years before all of It can be utilized. The roperty investment on March 1st was $:t.365. i:i. If to this is added the 1.200 00 paid for the Moorefle'.d plant the total property investment at he present time would be $4,565.1:'.. No study having been made of the onsolidated property to determine how much of the Moorefleld plant Mould be included, it is impossible to arrive at an exact figure for the &gt;roperty investment actually devoted to the use of the public. For the ake of this case, however, we will acept $4,000 as a reasonable figure. In the above statement we find one item of $71.81 for renewals and •eplacements and another of $47.45 for "balance of supplies account." evidently both of these are properly chargeable to maintenance. Some :&gt;f the item of $170.97 for running expense is also probably caused by maintenance expense, but there is no evidence to show how much. Ac - reptittg nine per cent of the property investment as a reasonable allow - ance for both maintenance and depreciation and deducting the two items nf $71.81 and $47.45, we have the following statement: NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY C( I) »MMI£81ON 1 .

Adding to this the $1,200.00 paid (or the Moorefield property, all of which had to be borrowed, and the $470.00 of indebtedness already outstanding, we have a total capital liability of $2,670.00 Allowing eight per cent for dividends we have $213.60, which exceeds the surplus as shown above. Mr. Sibley states that operating expenses are constantly increasing and he anticipates further increases the coming year. As secretary-treasurer of the company he has been giving much of his time to its management, but he receives no compensation. None of the other officers of the com - pany receive compensation. It would appear, therefore, that the com - pany is being operated very economically and that its expense will in - crease rather than decrease. If the discount for prompt payment is taken into consideration the increase in the revenue will amount to but about $150.00 for the year The rate asked for compares favorably with rates in effect in other companies in that territory, as the following statement would indicate: Eustis Telephone Company, business $1.50, residence $1.00; Bertrand Tele - phone Company, business $2.0o, residence $1.25; Gothenburg Telephoiv Exchange, business $1.50, residence $1.00; Farm &amp; Ranch Telephone Company, Moorefield, business $1.50, residence $1.00: Maxwell-Brady Tele - phone Company, business $1.50, residence $1.00 On this record, therefore, the Commission is of the opinion and finds that the rate asked for is reasonable and should be approved With reference to that portion of the application asking authority to cancel the discount of twenty-five cents per month to those subscribers who own their telephone instrument, it would appear that in this case the request is a reasonable one. As long as such a rate is on file sub - scribers generally have the privilege of availing themselves of it. If the practice became general the service of the company might be seriously interfered with through a lack of standardization of equipment and through its inability to properly supervise the maintenance of the pri - vate instruments. There are but few of these instruments in service at the present time. The company should take steps to purchase them and to dispense with the rate. The practise now followed by a few subscribers of paying their rental to a farm company in which they happen to have stock, which company, in turn, pays back but thirty-two cents to applicant as a switching charge, is clearly discriminatory and should be discontinued.

Later the old office burned irick building was built some two blocks away from the old I'pon further examination it was found that two of the private ners who were receiving the switching service for fifty cents a ned their own wires to the new central office, that four of the wners owned their own wires to the point where the old office ited. and that the company upon building the new central office i their wires to the new office; that the rest of the subscribers the service for titty cents a month simply owned their own As time developed tlie poles had been replaced by the tele - ipany. said poles carrying the private wires and all other wires testimony shows that the company maintains in niiany in the wires and phones of the private users, but certain charges for pairs are made la the private owners. No one was able to throw any question as to what portion of the maintenance is taken ate users and the phone company of the lines and at were privately owned. In fact, as time has gone on with the levelupmeiit in the telephone exchange it has developed that no one i v say who owns ali of the wires and the pole lines leading to the that are privately owned. sav The Commission is of the opinion that it would be impossible to con - linue such service because if twenty-two phone subscribers have a right to service at titty cents a month under such conditions, then anyone in Callaway would certainly have a right to run their own private wire to the switchboard and own their own phone and receive switching ser - vice at fifty cents a month. As the telephone exchange develops it would be impossible for the company to render adequate telephone ser - vice upon a system of distribution which was built by every phone user running his own private wire over the streets and alleys and public </seg>

Karly in the year 1916, the Nebraska Commission was notified that Interstate Commerce Commission had changed its rules of practice inch a manner as to require that state commissions be notified in where state rates might be affected by the adjustment of inter- ate rates brought in review before the federal body by reason of al - i;ed discrimination between border cities located at or near state lines. Nebraska State Railway Commission is of the opinion that certain </seg>
            <seg id="p348">348 NINTH ANNUAL REPORT I findings, as mentioned in the report of the Interstate Commission of the case herein cited, are erroneous and are not borne out by the facts We quote from the report: "Complainant's witnesses stated that Torriugton traffic was shipped to Henry and carted to Torrington and that during 1914 ninety-nine carloads of cattle were driven from TorrinKton to Henrv for shipment." Eie monthly station reports lodged with t lit- Nebraska Commission ■ ('. H. At Q. Railroad Company show thai there was forwarded the station of Henrv.

We do not point out these discrepancies because we think the question of per ton mile earnings material, but to show that the consideration given these matters by the fed - eral body might at least be mathematically correct, when the report itself shows that the distance and rates have been correctly stated. I Immediately following the comparison of "per ton mile revenue' the commodities named as compared with the system averag' nue per ton mile, the report contains the following language: "We find that the rates assailed on horses, rattle; hops tni sheep are not shown to he unreasonable </seg>
            <seg id="p349">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 349 Without stating it as a fact, it appears that the federal com - mission determined that the comparison of "per ton mile revenue" for the commodities named, with the system average "per ton mile revenue," was controlling in their decision that the Torring- tun. Wyoming, rates are reasonable and a proper yardstick to be used in determining a reasonable rate from Henry, Nebraska, if, in fact, said comparison was used as a controlling factor, then In that event the Interstate Commission should vacate its order when it is shown that by the use of the correct figures for making the comparison the average "revenue per ton mile" on the commodities mentioned is from 170 per cent to 200 per cent of the system aver - age "revenue per ton mile" instead of the same or less.

With these figures before us we again ask, how can the Nebraska Commission be expected to accept the findings of the Interstate Commission as ontrolling when the question of what constitutes a reasonable ate for the transportation of live stock in carload lots from Henry to Omaha is under consideration? If the Nebraska Commission was to grant the application herein made the only reason for so doing would be because the Interstate Commerce Commission in its more or less arbitrary and ex partc proceedings has taken the position, as announced in numberless re - cent decisions, that state commission or legislative-made rates have no greater sanctity than railroad-made rates, when considered by the federal commission, and, as in this case, they find that the rate should he increased from Henry to Omaha on carload ship - ments of live stock and from Omaha to Henry on less than car- </seg>

            <seg id="p592">592 PART VI ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT Lincoln, Neb., Dec. 31, 191« Nebraska Slate Hailway Commission, Lincoln, Nebraska. Gentlemen: — The following tabulation of cases referred to this department will give you an idea of the work we have accomplished during the past year. I have set out separately the applications that have been referred for a check and appraisement under the stock and bonds act, also the applications of public utilities, whose properties have been checked and appraised for rate-making purposes. A list of the applications for authority to construct transmission lines is also furnished herewith. and our experience so far indicates, as we predicted a year ago, thai the volume of these cases will greatly increase during the coming year. The transmission of electric power in this state is in its infancy and their construction will necessarily involve a large number of conflicts with existing wire properties. You will also find a list of complaints involving dangerous railroad crossings, unsatisfactory telephone service and railroad service investi - gated during the last year, some of which are pending as indicated. It is realized that there is much work of value to the state which might be done by this department, but the limited number of employees has forced us to confine our services to current matters as they have PHYSICAL VALUATION The physical valuation of railroad properties has been continued by calling for the reports of the different steam carriers showing the additions and betterments for each year. It has been impossible to ■ome on. The number ol •resent is as follows: persons emp ioyet in tl his department a Number Vocation of persons Chief Engineer 1 Chief Clerk 1 Stenographer 1 </seg>
            <seg id="p593">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 593 bring the values, as shown by the last report of 1913, down to date, but the information is on file with the department necessary to determine approximately the estimated values of these properties at the end of any fiscal year. The division of valuation of the Interstate Commerce Commission has done no work in this state, other than to inventory the Rock Island property, which they did in the summer of 1915. It is ex - pected that the government will continue their work in this state during the coming year. It is hoped that the number of engineers in this de - partment will be increased to such an extent that we will be able to check the work of the engineers of the Interstate Commerce Commission while engaged on the appraisement of the railroad properties in Ne - braska, in order that we may be able to make a complete report to the Commission of their work in this state. A meeting was held by this department last November, at which representatives of all of the telegraph, telephone and light and power properties were present for the purpose of formulating rules and general specifications agreeable to all parties at interest, regulating the construc - tion of wire crossings over railroad tracks and the construction of tele - graph, telephone and electric power transmission lines. The rules adopted at this conference were filed with this department for criticism and report to the Commission and when the above report has been thoroughly checked it will be submitted to you for further action. It was thought that rules of this character, expressing the opinion of the best engineers in the state, would be of much value in the construction of new properties and for the general guidance of the Commission. STOCKS AND BONDS Several applications under the stock and bonds act of 1909 have re - quired a property check or valuation.

            <seg id="p596">596 PART VII BLUE SKY DEPARTMENT Fully one-half of the time of the Chief Engineer and stenographer are required in the administration of the Blue Sky law. A list of the applications for authority to sell stock in this state which have been granted are set out below, and this list only reflects a small part of the work Involved in connection with the enforcement of the law. We have had correspondence with about 1200 different companies, incorporat - ed in this state and other states, who have inquired about the require - ments of the Commission. It may be noted that only a few of these com - panies have filed their applications, as many of them failed to com - ply with the requirements of the statute. In addition to the investiga - tions connected with the applications granted and the correspondence referred to, many conferences have been held of which no record has been kept. I believe that the moral effect 'of this law is good and I am convinced that the people of the state of Nebraska are being saved hundreds of thousands of dollars annually by reason of the fact that the sale of fraudulent securities is prohibited by this statute.
