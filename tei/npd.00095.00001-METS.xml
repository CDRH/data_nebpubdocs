         <seg id="p017">Introduction The defense activities, the declaration of war, the construction of Army and Navy ordnance plants, air bases, satellite airfields, and other defense plants brought about a decided change in the highway pro - gram for the past two years. Through the passage of the Defense Highway Act of 1941, the Congress provided funds for: (1) the con - struction of access roads to military and naval establishments and to defense manufacturing plants, (2) the correction of critical deficiencies in the Strategic Network of Highways, and such other highway pro - jects as are certified as being essential to the national defense, (3) the construction of flight strips or auxiliary landing areas along the public highways for the use of service-type aircraft, and (4) advanced en - gineering surveys, preparation of plans, and acquisition of right of way for highway projects to employ surplus labor that will become avail - able at the end of the war. The funds that were made available for the construction of access roads and flight strips need not be matched and may be used in pay - ment of all or any part of the cost of surveys, plans, construction work, and right of way. The funds that have been made available for the construction of the Strategic Network of Highways must be matched; they may be used to pay seventy-five percent of the cost of construc - tion work and engineering and fifty per cent of the cost of the neces - sary right of way. The funds that the Federal Government has made available for payment for advance engineering surveys also must be matched and may not be used to pay more than fifty per cent of the cost of the surveys. Prior to the enactment of the Defense Highway Act, the War Department, in conjunction with the Public Roads Administration, selected a nation-wide system of highways that was considered im - portant for military purposes. This system is known as the "Strategic Network of Highways" as referred to in the above mentioned Act of Congress. In Nebraska this network includes: (1) U.S. 75 from the Kansas State line north to Omaha, (2) U.S. 30 Alt. west from the Missouri River at Omaha to the junction with U.S. 30 west of Clarks, thence west on U.S. 30 to the Wyoming State line, and (3) U.S. 81 from the Kansas State line north to Norfolk, U.S. 275 from Norfolk to O'Neill, and U.S. 281 from O'Neill to the South Dakota State line. A directive with respect to all apportionments of Federal-aid funds that were made prior to the enactment of the Defense Highway Act of 1941, or subsequent thereto, has restricted the use of such funds to projects that are essential to the national defense, and then only when they are certified by the Army or Navy as being essential to the prosecution of the war. The Executive Committee of the American Association of State Highway Officials met with officials of the office of Production Man - agement, whose responsibilities later were transferred to the War Production Board, to discuss priorities for material and equipment as they apply to highway construction and maintenance. At first, only 5 </seg>
         <seg id="p018">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER metal products were considered as being critical materials, but later restrictions were extended to the use of lumber, asphalt products. cement, and other materials. Provisions were made for approval of the use ol critical materials in projects that were certified by the Army or Navy when shown that the use of such materials could not be eliminated either through the use of non-critical materials or through changes in design. Any such approval is given by the War Production Board by issuing a preference rating order. Complete infor - mation concerning the procedure that is followed in requesting pre - ference rating orders and restrictions on the use of critical materials is given in the portion of this report that deals with the activities of the Division of Construction. Bureau of Highways. The Committee on Standards of the American Association of State Highway Officials suggested changes in design and construction stand - ards to reduce or eliminate the use of critical materials in construction projects through the substitution of non-critical materials wherever it is possible to do so. The changes that were recommended by the Committee on Standards were used to the fullest extent possible in the design of highway construction work, in Nebraska. Such changes that were made are mentioned in the report of the Bridge Section of the Division of Design. Bureau of Highways. In 1941 surveys were made and plans completed for a program of highway construction work for the entire year 1942, hoping that there would be no delay in awarding contracts in the early part of the year 1942. thus permitting the contractors and the Department to plan their work and to know definitely the projects and the total cost of the projects to be let to contract by the Department during the year. Upon the passage of the Defense Highway Act of 1941, it appeared that a large program of highway construction work could be executed in Nebraska, carrying on our regularly planned 1942 program, together with a considerable volume of work on the Strategic Network of High - ways In the fall of 1941. it became apparent that certain materials and equipment that were needed for highway construction work were becoming more and more difficult to obtain, and that a curtailment of our program of work was necessary. This Department has endeavored to co-operate in every way pos - sible with the Army. Navy, and all other engineers and officials who have been responsible for the construction of ordnance plants, air bases, and satellite airfields in Nebraska. We have furnished informa - tion pertaining to soil conditions within the defense areas and have made our records available for their use in preparing plans and specifi - cations. Some of the Department's testing and surveying equipment has been rented to them for use in performing engineering work. We also have aided in the early completion of war work by postponing work on active highway contracts, thereby permitting contractors to use their equipment on the Army and Navy projects. In such cases the contractors have been granted extensions of time to complete the work on the highway contracts. </seg>
         <seg id="p019">INTRODUCTION The Department also co-operated with the War Production Board through its Conservation Division in the collection of scrap materials. The county chairmen and committee members arranged for collecting the scrap materials at locations where loads of comparatively large and convenient sizes could be obtained and transported to rail or truck shipping points without excessive travel by our personnel and trucks. The total amount of construction work that the Department let to contract in 1941 is $4,071,160.35 This, however, does not represent the total volume of construction work that was performed during that year. Construction work that was estimated to cost $2,024,689.22, and had been let to contract in 1940, was completed in 1941. As a result of the limitations on the use of Federal-aid funds, the restrictions with respect to the use of critical materials, and the shortage of equipment, our 1942 program was reduced to the extent that only a comparatively small volume of work could be let to contract. The total estimated cost of the construction work for which the Department awarded contracts in 1942 is $1,394,482.31. Tabulations which show the volume of the several different types of construction work that was performed in the biennium, both by contract and by direct labor, are included in the report of the activities of the Division of Construction. The activities of this Department were expanded in this biennium to provide closer supervision of the work of testing materials. The testing laboratory, which previously had been operated as a part of the University of Nebraska, now functions as an integral part of this Department. The manner of handling contractors' estimates and vouchers has been improved so that payment is expedited. The changes that are involved also have resulted in economies not only in this Department but also in the offices of the Tax Commissioner and the State Auditor, in that the number of documents that must be handled has been reduced substantially. Changes in the procedure that is followed in acquiring right of way and purchasing borrow have been made to expedite payments to the owners of the land that is involved. In the past, contracts for right of way and for borrow stipulated unit prices that were to be paid for quantities that were used and, since the total amounts to be paid could not be determined until after the work was completed, payments seldom were made prior to the completion of all work on a project. Through the adoption of the policy of purchasing the mini - mum quantities of right of way and borrow that will be required for the construction of any project, before work on the project is started, and of including provisions for obtaining additional quantities of right of way or borrow at unit prices per acre that are agreed upon in the contracts, the Department is able to eliminate delays, usually of many months, in making payments to the owners of the properties that are affected. The measurement of borrow by area, generally with prescribed maximum depths to which excavation may be made, in - stead of measurement by volume, which this change involves, has </seg>
         <seg id="p020">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER been found very satisfactory. One of the most important changes that were made in the past two years, and one that affects all of the personnel of the Department, is the adoption of merit rating systems. The adoption of the merit rating system for engineering positions resulted from the survey of those positions that was made in the months of March and April, 1941, by Mr. Allen P. Richmond, Jr., a member of the permanent staff of the American Society of Civil Engineers, under the direction of Dean Thomas R. Agg of the School of Engineering, lowa State College. After that survey had been completed and the related merit system had been adopted, the Department made a study of the non-engineer - ing, or maintenance and clerical, positions and established a merit rating system for employees in those positions. The report of the Division of Administration, Bureau of Highways, contains information concerning the survey of engineering positions, the study of other positions in the Department and the resultant merit systems, in great - er detail. The 1941 State Legislature amended the statutes pertaining to the establishment of the Nebraska Safety Patrol and provided the addi - tional authority of peace officers for members of the organization. The Superintendent of Law Enforcement and Public Safety was made the chief officer of the Patrol with direct responsibility to the Gov - ernor, for the enforcement of the laws of the State pertaining to felonies The administration of and approval of expenditure of funds by the Nebraska Safety Patrol still is delegated to the Director of the Motor Vehicle Division. Authority to issue "limited drivers' licenses", upon the partial suspension of an operator's license by the courts, has been vested in the Director of the Motor Vehicle Division. This change has done much to improve a serious situation which formerly arose through manda - tory revocations, or suspensions of drivers' licenses upon conviction for violations of certain traffic laws. Under the "limited operator's license" provision, an operator may be restricted by a court to occupa - tional driving and have such court action confirmed by the Director. The critical shortage of steel developed a problem in furnishing the license plates for motor vehicles. In an effort to conserve the maximum amount of steel, a small "tab" plate is to be furnished instead of the regular license plate and will be issued to all applicants for 1943 registrations. The "tab" plates shall be attached to the 1942 license plates. At the specific request of the War Department, the Motor Vehicle Division conducted a state-wide inventory of trucks and busses. This survey is being carried on continuously. Beginning in 1942, tractors and semi-trailers were licensed indivi - dually The registration of semi-trailers, which entails the payment of the nominal fee of one dollar for each vehicle that is registered has placed on the personal property tax list, many such vehicles which formerly were not reported for taxation. </seg>
         <seg id="p021">INTRODUCTION The number of employees in this Department has been reduced considerably from the number that have been employed in recent years. This reduction was the greatest in 1942 and may be attributed principally to the fact that a large number of employees have been granted leaves of absence and also because many others have resigned to accept offers of more lucrative employment which, in most instances, is at occupations that are a part of the war effort. As is shown in many places in this report, the volume of construction work that was performed in this biennium has been much smaller than that which was performed in such periods in the recent past. The number of employees has been kept in proportion to the reduced volume of work by limiting the number of persons who were employed to replace those employees who were granted leaves of absence, those who re - signed to accept other employment, or those who terminated their employment with this Department for any other reason. Leaves of absence, with no losses in seniority rights or rank, are granted those employees who resign to join some branch of the armed forces of the United States with the understanding that each of them must apply for reinstatement within forty days after his service with the armed forces is completed satisfactorily and with the further understanding that he must still be qualified to perform the duties of the position he held when he left the Department. No such leave of absence has been granted any employee who has resigned for any other reason. In September, 1942, the Federal Works Administrator announced that the first actual engineering work on post-war public construction— a projected highway building program to cost nearly $500,000,000 — was well under way. During the past several months this Department has been making preliminary surveys, preparing plans, and obtaining options on additional right of way in order to have a considerable amount of work ready to let to contract immediately upon the termi - nation of the existing emergency. The Department can not estimate the revenue from the existing tax on gasoline that may be expected, with any reasonable degree of accuracy, particularly because of the effect of the acute shortage of rubber and the restrictions on the use of gasoline that have been im - posed by the Federal Government. Besides being one of Nebraska's most valuable properties which must be preserved, the entire State Highway System is an important part of the Nation's highway trans - portation system which must be maintained in proper condition for the successful prosecution of the war. There are many locations on the State Highway System where the construction work that has been done has become inadequate, and the cost of maintenance is un - reasonably high. The use of State funds, in matching funds that the Federal Government has provided for that purpose, to the maximum extent possible in the construction of such portions of the State High - way System, is recommended as an unquestionably sound investment. </seg>

         <seg id="p023">Bureau of Highways The primary purpose of this portion of this report is to point out a few of the more or less unusual achievements of the Bureau of High - ways. For information in detail concerning the operation of this Bureau, the attention of readers is invited to the accounts of the activi - ties and functions of the several Divisions of which the Bureau is composed, which follow in this report. In general, the organization and functions of the Bureau of High - ways are the same as those of the Bureau of Roads and Bridges as they existed in preceding years, except that a Division of Administra - tion has been created to handle all personnel matters, and the testing laboratory which previously had been operated by the University of Nebraska now is placed under the direct supervision of the Depart - ment. The position of Equipment Engineer also was created in the Division of Maintenance, principally to provide closer supervision of the operations of keeping the equipment that is purchased by this Department in satisfactory operating condition. In order to make systematic plans for reconstruction, repair, and maintenance of the various classes of bituminous surfacing that al - ready are in use, an inventory of the condition of all such roads is being made. A rating for each individual section of the portions of the State Highway System, that are surfaced with bituminous materials, is determined. Each such rating is based on the degree and extent of flaws and failures that now are evident. Due to the fact that soil conditions and climate in Nebraska have a very great influ - ence on the stability of the different types of low cost surfacing, wide variations in the condition of any individual section of road are ob - served at different times of the year. Normally, the period of great - est distress in bituminous surfacing in this State occurs in the months of April and May. For this reason, the condition rating that is estab - lished by the inventory will be correlated with the conditions that have been observed in previous periods of maximum distress. Factors, such as thickness and type of the original construction work, soil conditions, previous cost of maintenance, rainfall, and traffic also will be correlated with such rating that is determined by the survey. By the use of information established by the inventory of condition and through further study, it is expected that the relative urgency of required betterment or reconstruction work can be determined more scientifically. The ratings are expected to establish the extent of improvements which are necessary to make the various sections satis - factory for year-around use, and can be justified economically. They also are expected to indicate the relative sequence of work which 11 </seg>

A study of the condition of concrete pavements also is being made. Particular attention is being given the progressive deterioration that has been observed in some concrete pavements in this area, as well as in several other States throughout the country. The surveys are made to determine the conditions under which the deterioration de - velops, and to establish the necessity for measures that should be undertaken to prevent further depreciation of the pavements. The normal practice is to apply bituminous seal and armor coats whenever the cracking has progressed sufficiently to indicate that further des - tructive deterioration might be relatively rapid unless the protective covering is applied. The study phases of these investigations include laboratory research, conducted jointly with other State highway de - partments and trade associations, to develop methods of revising concrete mixtures and specifications so that the deterioration may be reduced to a minimum. </seg>

         <seg id="p027">Division of Administration FUNCTIONS The Division of Administration is charged with handling personnel matters of the Bureau of Highways and is responsible for the pur - chase, maintenance, and custody of engineering and testing equipment, and office furniture and equipment. The Highway Planning Survey is also an activity of this Division. In the handling of personnel matters, it is the responsibility of this Division to carry out the policies of the Department relative to employment, classification and rating of employees, maintenance of personal service records, and the consideration of special employment problems involved in establishing rules and regulations relative to con - duct and privileges. Additions to personnel, when required, are made or approved in accordance with minimum standards adopted by the De - partment. Employees are transferred from one Division or district to another, as the requirements of the various Divisions and districts fluctuate. Whenever a Division of the Bureau of Highways is in need of additional employees for new work or anticipates a surplus of employees resulting from completed work, the Division of Adminis - tration is advised, and necessary action is taken to adjust the situation by the assignment of new employees, or by the transfer, or release of employees, as the overall conditions in the Bureau may warrant. The methods employed in the classification and periodic rating of the employees of the Bureau are described later in this section. It was found desirable to divide the employees into three separate or distinct groups for the purpose of classifying, rating, and setting up wage schedules. The engineering employees were handled as one group, and the non-eneineering group was subdivided into the clerical employees and all maintenance employees not included in the other two groups. All field engineering and testing equipment is purchased by this Division. A store room is maintained for new and used equipment, and equipment is shipped out from this store room upon requisition from employees in the field. When no longer needed in the field, equipment is returned to the store room where it is cleaned, repaired if necessary, and stored for future use. A well-equipped instrument repair shop is maintained, and the equipment is' expertly repaired. A complete record is kept of the transfer of all equipment from the store room to the employee, and from the employee to the 'store room or to another employee. The employee is held accountable for all equipment checked out of the store room. Office equipment and furniture is also purchased by this Division for the Bureau of Highways. As the need for furniture and equipment 15 </seg>

On January 18, 1941, the State Engineer, with the ap - proval of the Governor, requested the American Society of Civil Engineers to make a survey of engineering positions and salaries in the Nebraska Department of Roads and Irrigation similar to the studies made for the Arizona and Nevada Highway Departments. As required by the procedure adopted for such surveys, this request was approved by the Nebraska local section of the Society. The executive committee of the Society then gave its approval, and at the request of the President. Dean Thomas R. Agg of the School of Engineering at lowa State College and former Director of the Society from this area agreed to supervise the work. Mr Allen P. Richmond, Jr., a member of the permanent staff of the Society was assigned to make the survey. Mr. Richmond was in residence in Lincoln for a period of about seven weeks beginning March 5, 1941, for the purpose of making the survey The services of both members of the Society were furnished without expense to the State of Nebraska, with the exception of the necessary traveling and subsistence expense, which was a very nominal sum. Purpose. As stated in the survey report now on file with this Department, neither the author of the report, the Society, nor the local section of the Society was interested in the rating of any individual or his salary The survey dealt with the duties and responsibilities of positions, the minimum qualifications to be demanded of those who fill these positions, and the preparation of specifications to be used as a guide in establishing a system that would function in an orderly and scientific manner. The purpose of the survey was to provide, after a careful ex - amination of the existing situation, a recommended plan and procedure for the management of engineering personnel matters in the Depart - ment A plan was desired that would increase the probability of hiring thoroughly competent employees and insure recognition of good service and self-improvement by provisions for advancement. Scope. The survey consisted of the following procedures: A. A detailed study of the organization of the Department and of engineering positions in it, to sense the general pattern of the positions and detect any important divergencies from similar work elsewhere. Special attention was given to positions where the work was highly specialized. B. Preparation of grade specifications to be recommended for engineering positions in the Department. C The testing of these specifications, and the instruction of res- </seg>
         <seg id="p031">BUREAU OF HIGHWAYS ponsible officers in their use, through the medium of trial ratings of individual employees. D. Joint study, with departmental officers, of various existing merit rating systems, and of methods of preparing a set of job descriptions. General recommendations as to preparation of each for Nebraska. E. Collection, compilation, and analysis of all salary data that could be secured from Nebraska, surrounding States, and other sources. Deduction of a salary schedule to be recommended for application to positions in the Department. F. Preparation of charts, tabulations, and notes for various pur - poses, and completion of the report. G. Presentation of the report, with recommendations. Recommendations. As a result of the survey of engineering positions and salaries in the Nebraska Department of Roads and Irri - gation, Mr. Richmond recommended to the Governor that: 1. The grade specificatons presented in the report be adopted for seven professional and four sub-professional grades for en - gineering employees of the Nebraska Department of Roads and Irrigation. 2. A merit rating, or service record, system be devised by the State Engineer and adopted. 3. Job descriptions, or descriptions of specific classes of positions, be prepared by the State Engineer and adopted. 4. The proposed scale of salary ranges corresponding to the re - commended grades be adopted, insofar as they are not incon - sistent with the laws of Nebraska. 5. The State Engineer be authorized and instructed to put into effect, without delay, each of the above recommendations. 6. Appropriate steps be taken to bring about any amendment of the present laws of Nebraska necessary to accomplish the results recommended. 7. When the final program is in operation, steps be taken to in - sure its continuance. ADOPTED PROGRAM After due consideration, the Governor authorized the State Engineer to adopt the grade specifications from Mr. Richmond's report for seven professional and four sub-professional grades for the engi - neering employees of the Department of Roads and Irrigation; to de - vise and adopt a merit rating system; to prepare and adopt job des - criptions for specific classes of positions; and to adopt the proposed salary scale corresponding to the recommended grades, insofar as they were not inconsistent with the laws of Nebraska.

         <seg id="p033">BUREAU OF HIGHWAYS eligible for the various jobs in the Department falling in the respective grades. These specifications also provide the standards which must be met by the employee in order to receive an assignment within a grade or a promotion to a higher grade. The grouping of jobs, similar in character or degree of responsibility, provides an orderly arrange - ment and sequence of jobs, and makes orderly progress and advance - ment within a grade or from one grade to another, something tangible to be attained. After the adoption of a set of grade specifications in accordance with item number one of the recommended program, all engineering positions or jobs in the Department were classified in their proper grades without regard to the individual holding the position. When it was determined to which grade a position belonged, the person holding that position satisfactorily and meeting the minimum requirements of the grade, was allocated to that grade. A group, consisting of the heads of all divisions, classified all engineering posi - tions and rated all engineering employees on the basis of the grade specifications. Grade specifications outline very briefly in general terms the duties and responsibilities of a person working within the grade and the minimum requirements to be met relative to: 1. Education and experience. 2. Knowledge and skill. 3. Personal qualifications. The standards for education and experience have been established on a rather high plane consistent with the requirements of the job. Although a formal education is a distinct advantage to the young engineer in meeting these high standards, provision has been made for the ambitious, progressive, capable, hard-working man to demonstrate the attainment of satisfactory professional status without full formal training. Merit Rating System. After positions were assigned to grades and the individuals holding those positions were found to meet the mini - mum requirements of the grade, each person was scheduled to receive the minimum salary of the grade, involving generally a raise in pay. The relative position of any employee within the grade in which he was assigned was determined by the merit rating system—see item number two of the recommended program. The merit rating system is a device designed to determine the relative position of an employee within a grade and the eligibility for his advancement to a higher grade. The purpose of the system, accomplished by means of awarding points of merit for education, experience and personal traits of charac - ter, is to reward an employee for years of satisfactory service, adequate preparation for the work being performed, and the display of desirable personal qualities such as industry, co-operativeness, and the faculty of getting along with others. The points earned for education and experience are based on the record filed in the Department. The points awarded for the display of desirable personal qualities are determined by means of rating sche- </seg>

         <seg id="p037">BUREAU OF HIGHWAYS out the rating schedules for rating the personal characteristics of en - gineering employees once each year shortly after the close of the con - struction season. The point value used for an employee's personal characteristics is a composite of the opinions of several supervisors, and the probability of prejudice or personalities entering into the score is held to a minimum. Additional experience or education gained during the year is also credited to the employee at the time of review. To provide a complete record of the work actually performed in the service of the Department, an "Employees Personal Service Record" card has been devised for all employees. This service record carries a complete record of the employee's personal data, education, previous experience, changes in rates of pay with the Department, and the specific jobs performed for the Department. Such a record, particularly the specific jobs performed, is essential in the determina - tion of an employee's eligibility for special assignments or promotion. It shows to what extent the individual meets the minimum require - ments of knowledge and skill required for a job, conveniently com - bined with a complete record of his education and experience. Job Descriptions. In accordance with the recommendations in item number three of the recommended program, "job descriptions" for enginsering positions have been prepared in tentative form and after review by the officials of the Department will be adopted for the Department. A "job description" differs from the grade specifications in that a job description states specifically the duties of a particular position, while the grade specifications are general in character and refer to a group of positions, similar in general requirements. Salary Schedules. Recommended salary ranges for professional and sub-professional grades in the Nebraska Department of Roads and Irrigation are indicated in Fig. 6 by Curve "A". Also shown in Fig. 6, and indicated by Curve "B", was the recommendation of the repprt as to salary range to be adopted immediately "as a temporary inter - mediate step but that Curve "A" gave the proper salary ranges for the grades adopted in Nebraska and that every effort should be made to achieve this curve fully within not more than one year." Fig. 7 carries the curve showing the salary ranges that were adopted on July 1, 1941, for all engineering grades in the Department. These salary ranges within the grades are now in effect in this Department. The adopted curve is identical with the recommended Curve "B" up to and including professional Grade 3. Above Grade 3 the salary ranges were adjusted to conform to the statutory requirement for the salary of the State Engineer. Losses in Engineering Personnel. Although the newly-adopted salary ranges provided substantial increases generally throughout the various grades of engineering personnel, the Department has suffered rather severe losses in engineering personnel during the current bi- </seg>
         <seg id="p038">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER ennium. These losses have been caused by employees resigning to accept highly remunerative work with war industries and war-time construction projects; enlistments in the armed forces of the United States; and in minor degree to accept employment with private indus - try. During July, 1941, the Bureau of Highways employed 892 persons while during October, 1942, 561 persons were employed—a net loss of 331 employees, or 37 per cent. In July, 1941, 392 employees were classified as senior, associate and junior engineers, engineering as - sistants, and inspectors in the Bureau of Highways, and supervisory and non-supervisory employees in the highway planning survey. By October, 1942, only 125 men were employed in the same groups, or a loss of 68 per cent in 15 months. The Bureau of Highways was able to continue operations on an efficient basis only because the construc - tion program during the 1942 season was considerably lighter than for the 1941 season. The most severe losses in engineering personnel occurred late in 1941 and during the first six months of 1942, at the time construction work was started on ordnance plants and air bases in Nebraska. Seventy-five employees have left the employment of the Bureau of Highways to enter the armed forces of the United States, and this number will increase as our armed forces are expanded. NON-ENGINEERING EMPLOYEES During the summer months of 1941, a study was made of the posi - tions and salaries of the non-engineering, or clerical and maintenance employees, of the Department. The objectives of the study were two - fold: First, to classify employees systematically with logical sequence from one group of positions to another and with proper regard to other classifications of similar jobs with other organizations in order that .comparisons might be made in the various salary schedules in operation in other organizations; and second, to establish for the vari - ous classifications, a wage scale that is the approximate equivalent of the going wage in the community for similar work, particularly in organizations where the jobs are classified on a comparable basis. The first step taken with non-engineering positions was similar to the procedure followed for classifying engineering positions. Job descriptions were prepared for all positions in the Department.

Wage schedules in effect November 1, 1942, for non-engineering clerical employees and maintenance employees are shown in Figs. 8 and 9 respectively. While these schedules provided for general wage increases in the various groups, a high jrate of turnover of clerical employees has continued throughout the biehnium, caused in the main by attractive salaries in both private and war industries, and other war activities.

The heavy turnover and unusual losses of maintenance employees is also due to the great demand for mechanics and equipment operators in war industries and war plant construction. From a total of 390 monthly employees in January, 1941, the Maintenance Division has dropped to a total of 321 for October, 1942. Heavy losses and turnover have likewise occurred among the mechanics and equipment operators paid on an hourly basis. HIGHWAY PLANNING SURVEY History and Activities. The highway planning survey was organ - ized in March, 1936 to conduct, in co-operation with the Federal Public Roads Administration, numerous state-wide surveys. The data col - lected in these surveys were to serve as the basis of a long range pro- </seg>
         <seg id="p041">BUREAU OF HIGHWAYS gram for improvement of the State's highway system. One and one - half percent of all Federal-aid highway funds since 1936 have been available for use in making these surveys. These funds were supple - mented by State matching funds up to and including 1939. Since that time, however, the cost of the surveys has been defrayed largely with Federal-aid funds. Highway planning has passed through several stages of develop - ment. First, there was the collection of data, then the tabulation and analysis of the data collected, and finally the permanent or continuing planning organization of today. The original phases of the survey were concerned with the collec - tion and analysis of data relative to (1) the mileage and physical characteristics of the roads of the State, (2) the volume and class of traffic using these roads, including a study of trucking characteristics, (3) the relation of street and highway finances to the finances of all other governmental agencies, (4) the original cost, service life and annual cost of roads of each surface type, and (5) the characteristics of the various soils as related to highway construction. All original phases of the survey, except the Road Life Study, have been completed and reports made. The Road Life Study is scheduled to be completed in the near future. The following maps and reports have been prepared and are available at cost: 1. Maps: —County base, transportation, mail-route, and traffic-flow maps. —State base, transportation, and traffic-flow maps. —Straight-line diagrams of State Highways. 2.

         <seg id="p042">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER highway finance. Supplemental data are assembled from time to time as needed in the solution of certain rather localized special problems. With the wide range of information available from the survey de - cisions relating to highway programs and improvements may be made by government and highway officials on theTbasis of known facts. Since the start of the war, additional problems relating to high - ways and to highway transportation have arisen. Numerous war in - dustries, ordnance plants, and air bases have been located and were under construction in the State during the biennium. Proper road design and well chosen traffic control devices for access roads to these plants required special surveys to supply the necessary design data. Similarly Federal agencies including the Office of Production Manage - ment, Office of Defense Transportation and the Public Roads Adminis - tration have, in the conduct of nation-wide surveys of transportation problems created by the war situation, requested special studies or special analyses. These surveys were required by them to help formu - late nation-wide policies in the administration of activities involving or related to highway transportation. Summary of Work. During the years of 1941 and 1942 the high - way planning survey carried on, among other things, the following activities: 1. Published Bulletins No. 5, 7, 9, and 10, covering phases of the original survey. 2. Revised and kept up to date the county and State transporta - tion maps, and straight-line diagrams. 3. Furnished information used by the Division of Design in select - ing a Secondary Federal-aid system, which in conjunction with the State highways, carries approximately 75 percent of the rural traffic with but 14 percent of the rural mileage. 4. Prepared annual statistical reports covering the amount and source of highway revenues and the purpose of highway dis - bursements for the State and local governmental units, and showing the changes in mileage and surface types of the State and local roads. 5. Conducted a comprehensive traffic survey of the State highway and proposed Federal-aid secondary system. 6. Computed from traffic counts the annual average daily traffic to be used in drafting a State traffic-flow map which will be released in the near future, and in the preparation of revised traffic-inventory tables and a Highway Needs report. 7. Prepared tabulations and maps at the request of the Public Works Reserve, for use by counties when laying out local road construction programs to be carried on during the post war period. 8. Collected and consolidated for the Office of Production Manage - ment information as to quantities of critical materials needed </seg>
         <seg id="p043">BUREAU OP HIGHWAYS for the construction, and the new machinery and parts essential to the maintenance, of the several road systems of the State. 9. Coded and prepared for the Office of Defense Transportation and the Office of Price Administration, certain tabulations from the road-use interviews relative to the driving characteristics as related to the occupation of the owner and the total mileage driven. 10. Conducted a special.truck weighing-study, at the request of the Public. Roads Administration, to determine the war-time chang - es in truck traffic volumes and weights. 11. Published a monthly summary showing traffic Changes as indi - cated by the various permanent automatic traffic recorders in the State. 12. Collected information and prepared many reports at the request of highway department officials, the Public Roads Administra - tion and other governmental agencies. During 1942, over most of the State, there has been a steady de - cline in traffic as compared to the same months of 1941. Figures 10 to 21 show graphically and in tabular form by months the average daily traffic as recorded by seven automatic recorders from January, 1940, to September, 1942, and for five recorders, from the date of their instal - lation to September, 1942, inclusive. While generally the trend in traf - fic has been downward, traffic in areas immediately adjacent to de - fense projects has greatly increased. Highways that formerly carried less than 1,000 vehicles per day in some cases during war plant con - struction were carrying up to 4,000 vehicles per day; Highways former - ly carrying around 2,000 vehicles per day carried.up to 7,000 vehicles per day and one highway formerly used by from three to four thou - sand vehicles per day is now carrying around 9,000 vehicles per day. Figure 22 shows graphically! and in tabular form, by months the net gallonage of gasoline received for use as motor fuel upon which tax was paid by dealers from January, 1940 to September, 1942, in - clusive. The decrease noted in gasoline consumption for 1942 is not nearly so great as that noted for traffic. This may be explained by the increased use of gasoline in defense areas, especially that used in construction equipment, and by a tendency on the part of gasoline retailers to use their storage facilities to capacity in order to be pre - pared in the event of temporary shortages of transportation. Several marked changes as to traffic volume and truck weights were noted; in the truck weighing study, conducted from July 23 to , August 6, 1942. Weighing operations were carried on 8 hours each at elevenof the original weighing stations during the same .hours of the day and at approximately the..same time of.the year as during the survey in 1936. These eleven; stations were geographically distributed over the State and none were immediately adjacent to defense activi - ties, so the picture presented, should be fairly reliable as to trend. </seg>
         <seg id="p044">REPORT OF THESTATE ENGINEER From this sample, it is interesting to note that while passenger car traffic in 1942 has decreased 15 percent as compared to that of 1936, truck traffic has actually increased 5 percent, giving a total decrease of but 11 percent. Whereas, local passenger car traffic has shown a decrease of but 8 percent, foreign passenger car traffic has fallen off 28 percent indicating the pronounced drop of tourist traffic the past reason. The tractor-truck semi-trailer combination type of vehicle was almost twice as common as it was six years ago, while approximately 13 percent less single unit trucks were observed. Almost exactly the same proportion—approximately one-third—of trucks traveled empty as did six years ago. The weight of single-unit trucks was approximately 4 percent heavier than in 1936, while that for semi-trailers was approximately 30 percent greater. The average truck today carries approximately one ton more pay load than in 1936. The heavier loads, both total and axle, and the frequency of oc - currence are of particular interesjt to highway engineers as these give some idea of the life which may' be exepcted from concrete or bitu - minous pavements, and an idea of the adequacy of our present bridges. Axle loads above 8 tons and total truck weights above 15 tons were much more common in 1942 than 1936. For the average 100 trucks weighed in 1942, 12 axles exceeded 8 tons, and 13 trucks weighed in excess of 15 tons, as compared to 1 axle in excess of 8 tons and 2 trucks weighing in excess of 15 tons in 1936. An interesting development adopted for counting traffic is the portable traffic counting machine. During the 1941 traffic survey, for the first time, most of the traffic counting was done by these portable counters, supplemented by occasional manual classification counts. The counters are magnetic, operate from dry or storage batteries, and have a pneumatic switch. This switch is actuated by impulses of air set up by the wheels of a vehicle as they pass over the hollow rub - ber tube stretched across the roadway. The counters are of two types, those that record the traffic by 15-minute or hourly intervals, and those that have a dial and must be read from time to time. By use of these machines it is possible, with a few men, to secure sufficient 24-hour traffic counts to cover the State at considerably less cost than 8-hour counts could be obtained, manually by five times as many men. </seg>

         <seg id="p059">Division of Records and Control The Division of Records-and Control is responsible for fiscal and cost accounting, statistics, internal budget control, contract and miscel - laneous vouchers, pay rolls, Federal progress and final vouchers, com - pensation, filing and stenographic services Fiscal and cost accounting are centralized in the Lincoln office. It is the policy to maintain only such records as are required for proper financial control and cost accounts required by the officials of the Department. Requests are occasionally received for information which is not readily obtainable for the reason that such information has no real value in the economical administration of the Department. Monthly financial and cost reports are issued. These include income and cash statements, internal budget results, cost distribution under the headings of administration, operating overhead, construc - tion; maintenance, Motor Vehicle Division, Bureau of Irrigation, and status of Federal funds. WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION Operating as a self-insuring employer under the Nebraska Work - men's Compensation Act, the Department of Roads and Irrigation as - sumes liability for injuries suffered by its employees, providing, of course, that the injury is incurred[while the employee is acting within the scope of his employment with the Department. In operating as a self-insurer the Department has effected appreciable savings from the standpoint of industrial accident costs. During the biennium several lump sum settlements were made to individuals who were entitled to receive compensation over a period of years, either by reason;of an outstanding court award or the fact that compensation was due them for a specific disability resulting from an injury. In making these settlements, the total cost of com - pensation for this particular: biennium was substantially increased, especially in the division of construction; however, an appreciable saving was realized in the procedure. Reimbursements to this Department by third persons causing in - juries to employees of the Department during the biennium totaled $7,139.41, and although the expenditures made in these cases original - ly by the Department are shown in Table 8 as gross costs, it should be noted that this item very favorably decreased the net compensation cost to the Department. There are two cases pending, involving approximately $3,500 on which we should receive reimbursement. ' The cost of compensation to this Department in the division of maintenance, for the biennium was 1.3 percent of the total pay roll for that division. Underthe construction division for the same period, the cost was 6.7 percent, which as before noted includes a number of large lump sum settlements. (Continued on page 58) 47 </seg>

         <seg id="p117">Division of Design GENERAL The function and duties of this Division are to prepare plans for highway construction. These duties consist of the location of pro - posed roads, making of preliminary surveys, plotting of plans from field notes, design of roads, bridges, culverts, roadside improvement, and in conjunction with the Materials Division, the design of all types of hard surfacing. Some of the other activities consist of the prepara - tion of all maps, charts and miscellaneous drawings for the Depart - ment as a whole. Organixation. The basic structure of the organization of this Division is substantially the same as that existing during the previous biennium. War conditions, however, have necessitated the consolida - tion of several duties under one supervisor. Both the curtailment of highway work, due to shortage of critical materials, and the short - age of engineering personnel have forced minor changes in the organization. Nevertheless, the work of the Division is handled much the same and through the same channels as heretofore. The organization is subdivided into smaller units in order to facilitate the handling of all work assigned to it. These units or subdivisions of the organization are classified as follows: Road Design. This unit is responsible for the making of prelimi - nary surveys and the preparation of all construction plans with the exception of drainage structures and roadside improvement plans. Bridge Design. This unit is responsible for the preparation of plans for all bridges, grade separation structures, culverts, flumes, minor drainage structures for pavement and^ storm sewers, armored railroad crossings and crossing signals. Roadside Improvement. General plans for landscaping of the highways after construction, roadside parks, and special en - trance designs are prepared by this unit. Traffic Engineering. This subdivision makes detailed studies of all conditions affecting highway traffic, as well as plans for traffic control Personnel. War conditions during the greater part of this bien - nium have had a marked effect on the personnel of this Division. A large portion of the skilled and experienced engineers have either joined the armed forces or have accepted employment in some of the various war plants and industries. This loss of engineers has brought about a considerable change in the personnel of the Division. 105 </seg>
         <seg id="p118">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER j Many of the subdivisions are operating with skeleton forces. Many 1 transfers among the subdivisions have been necessary in order to equalize the loss of men. In spite of this condition, however, the same spirit of loyalty has characterized itself in the efforts of those ; remaining in the organization. i Federal-aid Secondary System. In accordance with the provisions of Section 7 of the "Federal Act of Authorization of June 16, 1936", j a system of Federal Aid Secondary or Feeder roads may be establish - ed in each State, not to exceed ten percent of the total open road mileage of the entire State. It is intended, according to the above act, that these roads shall include, exclusive of the Federal Aid Primary system, such roads as farm-to-market, mine-to-market, rural free delivery mail, public school bus, star, and other rural roads of community value which connect with important highways or which extend reasonably adequate highway service from such highways to rail points or local settlements. Rules and regulations governing the selection of proposed Fede - ral Aid Secondary routes as contained in the Federal memorandum entitled "Rules and Regulations for Construction of Secondary or Feeder Roads Under Act of June 16, 1936" have been accepted by this Department as a guide in making such selections. The initia] step in the selection of proposed roads for this system was to determine the maximum number of miles of the State's total allowable mileage that can be allocated to each county. The total open road mileage of the State as determined by the Highway Plan - ning Survey was 100,452. Ten percent of this number would entitle the State to 10,045.2 miles of secondary roads. A percentage factor based upon the unweighted average of the following individual county factors was used in determining the maximum secondary mileage allowable for each county: 1. Percentage of vehicular miles in the county as compared to the total vehicular miles for the entire State based on all open roads exclusive of the Federal Aid primary system and potential additions thereto. 2. Percentage of value of farm products of the county as com - pared to the total value of farm products for the entire State. 3. Percentage of farm or rural population of the county as com - pared to the total farm or rural population of the entire State. 4. Percentage of area of county as compared to the total area of the entire State. After determining the factor for each county as outlined above, the maximum county mileage is obtained by multiplying the factor for each county by the total allowable mileage for the State. j A minimum traffic criterion for each county was obtained by means of individually plotted charts. This criterion is the critical traffic point on all roads which have a traffic equal to or in excess </seg>
         <seg id="p119">BUREAU OF HIGHWAYS of the criterion and, as such,, become eligible for inclusion in the secondary system. Such roads as qualified according to the county criterion together with such roads as could be selected because of a particular type of service rendered were set aside or ear-marked for the system. It was considered advisable to select an initial system, somewhat less than the allowable, to be presented to the Public Roads Adminis - tration. Accordingly, the system as presented to the government for approval consisted of approximately 8,800 miles of the allowable 10,045.2. After the initial installment had been definitely selected by this Department, a special representative of the Public Roads Administra- XI mm HI(B| SI Spring Crack Bridge wilh Concrala-ilab Protection on Highway No. 3 Wail of Hebron. tion from Washington, D. C. reviewed in this office the system as selected. The 8,800-mile installment was formally presented to the Public Roads Administration on March 26, 1942. Due to war conditions, this Department has been informed that approval will not be given until after the emergency. Highway Design Standards. The highway system, for design purposes, is divided into two general classes; Le., primary and second - ary. The character and amount of traffic is taken into consideration in determining the design standards within these classifications. Pri - mary highways are designed for higher speeds, it being intended to so construct them as to alignment and grade that they will satisfac - torily take speeds from 60 to 70 miles per hour. On the secondary system the traffic is more or less of a rural character and slower speeds are generally used. These highways are designed for speeds from 35 to 45 miles per hour, and are not usually provided with dustless surfaces. A 22-foot width of concrete slab with 8-foot shoulder is now being used rather than the 20-foot width with 6-foot shoulder which has </seg>
         <seg id="p120">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER || been in use in the past. In the case of bituminous surfaces, 24-foot j widths are ordinarily used. An attempt is made to hold the grades j on the primary system to a maximum of 5 percent with an 800-foot i vertical sight distance. This distance is dependent, to some degree, j on the importance of the highway and the terrain through which j it passes. An exception to this, however, is the highways on the , Strategic Network, or system, on which the War Department has required the use of grades not in excess of 4 percent and shoulders j adequately wide for parking on all projects which are reconstructed. On the secondary system a roadway width of 26 feet and grades below 9 per cent with vertical sight distance of not less than 350 \ feet are usally used. Bridges on the secondary system are built of i minimum roadway width of 22 feet with a normal use of a 24-foot roadway. On the primary system, bridge widths vary from 26 to : 30 feet. It might be of interest to give some data which indicate the effect of standards of design on the cost of the finished highway. The quan - tities involved in the construction of the project are affected, standards being equal, by the terrain in which the project is located. The drain - age involved bears an important part also, not only on the structures required but also the quantities of grading necessary to complete the grade. For purposes of comparison, we show the following esti - mates as representative of the different types of construction quanti - ties under varying conditions. PRIMARY HIGHWAYS Grading: Extra heavy terrain, 50,000 cv. yd. per mile Heavy terrain, 35,000 cv. yd. per mile Medium terrain, 25,000 cv. yd. per mile Light terrain, 20,000 cv. yd. per mile Drainage cost, exclusive of bridges: Heavy conditions, $3,000 per mile Medium conditions, $2,000 per mile Light conditions, $1,000 per mile Bridges: The cost of bridges per foot depends upon the type of bridge used, the roadway width, and the nature of the foundations and height of the bridge above flow line. Normal costs of bridges are about as follows: Timber bridge with concrete floor, $60 per foot of length Concrete slab bridge on timber piling, $95 per foot of length Deck steel girder bridge with concrete floor, $135 per foot of length </seg>
         <seg id="p121">BUREAU OF HIGHWAYS SECONDAHY HIGHWAYS Grading: Heavy terrain, 30,000 cv. yd. per mile Medium terrain, 20,000 cv. yd. per mile Light terrain, 12,500 cv. yd. per mile In cases where day surfacing is needed an approximate amount of 4,000 cv. yd. per mile is required Drainage cost, exclusive of bridges: Heavy conditions, $2,000 per mile Medium conditions, $1,250 per mile Light conditions, $500 per mile Bridges: All secondary highways in general cost a little less than the primaries, inasmuch as slightly lower loading re - quirements are used. This difference in cost may be indicated by the following: Timber bridge with concrete floor, $55 per foot of length Concrete slab bridge on timber piling, $85 per foot of length Deck.steel girder bridge with concrete floor, $120 per foot of length In addition to the above construction costs, the right of way re - quired has a considerable bearing on the total cost of the project. It is not possible to establish a price which will fit all cases, but Table.23 on page 174 furnishes some information which will indicate the average costs as affected by the various conditions and locations in the State. War Effects. The establishment of war plants at various points in the State has created special problems in so far as handling highway traffic is concerned, and at some points it has been necessary that we design special intersections to handle this traffic. This is especially true in the case of the Fort Crook Bomber Plant, the Nebraska Ord - nance Plant at Mead, and the Naval Ammunition Depot at Hastings. On account of restrictions on critical materials, it has been nec - essary that new designs be developed, eliminating the use of such materials. This is especially true in the case of concrete slab and concrete structures in which steel has been an essential part. The concrete slab design has been revised by eliminating the steel rein - forcement and by changing the cross section to an 8-inch uniform thickness. In the case of concrete structures, it Jias been necessary to practically eliminate all steel reinforcement. This has made it neces - sary that, in some cases, we postpone the building of the structure until materials are available. In some cases we have been able to use de - signs which are considered to be adequate. This has had a tendency </seg>
         <seg id="p122">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER to increase the cost of the construction, due to the additional concrete I which is necessary to make up for the lack of steel. Reduction in highway construction due to war conditions has given this Division an opportunity to complete all right of way surveys and prepare data for right of way descriptions in connection with preliminary surveys. This will make immediate payment for right of way possible and eliminate the very objectionable feature of re - quiring property owners to wait several months for such payment. Location of New Highway Routes. During the biennium consi - derable attention has been given to the detailed location of new high- Looking Watt bom Viaduct on "O" StzMi In Lincoln way routes, as well as the relocation of existing routes oh which revisions may very properly be made. Special study has also been given to the correction of critical river bank conditions which, if not corrected, would ultimately result in serious damage to highway structures and roadway. REPORTS OF THE SUBDIVISIONS Road Design. The first step in the preparation of road plans ; after the Federal programs have been approved is the selection by the Design Engineer of the general location of each project. The specific location, however, is determined partly by aerial photographs furnished by the Agricultural Adjustment Administration, and partly by the preliminary survey engineers at the time the survey is made. This preliminary survey consists of taking a continuous profile with cross sections at various intervals or at points where the gradient ¦ </seg>

These copies are used in making what is termed a plan-in-hand inspection. Definite recommendations as to drainage structure sizes and proposed grade line are indicated on these prints. Any other con - ditions peculiar to this section of the road are also indicated on these prints. After this inspection has been made, the blue prints are returned to the Lincoln office and are used as a.basis for preparing the complete preliminary plans. All recommendations made on these Plain Concrate-uch Culvui. prints are closely followed in order to provide a set of working plans compatible with field conditions. After the plans have been corrected to comply with all recommendations, blue prints are again made from the plan and profile sheets. If the contemplated construction involves the use of Federal funds, these prints are transmitted to the Public Roads Administration. A representative of that Federal agency makes a field inspection of the proposed project, studying the recommendations made by the State as to their practical application to field conditions encountered. These prints are then returned by the Public Roads Administration to the Department of Roads and Irrigation and to this Division. Complete preliminary plans are then prepared in harmony both with the recom - mendations made by the State and by the Public Roads Administra - tion. All quantities involved in the proposed construction for each particular project are then tabulated in the form of a preliminary estimate, and this, together with prints of the finished plans, are transmitted to the Public Roads Administration for their formal ap - proval. </seg>

Muliipte-box Bridg* wUh Curb and Handrail on Highway Ho. 26 in Gaxdtn County Due to the issuance of the Priorities Critical List in August of 1941, it was necessary to make certain revisions in bridge and culvert types to reduce and eliminate, if possible, all items of construction involving theuse of structural and reinforcing steel. Thisnecessitated the .adoption of the plain concrete arch for culverts and the longi - tudinally laminated type'"of timber structure for bridges.: , Prior to the issuance of the Priorities Critical List, the concrete - slab bridge construction had been improved upon by increasing the thickness over the supports so that continuous type structures with central spans up to 48 feet 6 inches were economically justified. Previous to this improvement in design; this length was limited to 37 feet 6 inches. As noted in the previous report, the concrete-slab bridge has taken over a part of the field of usefulness of the-deck - steel-'girder construction. The above revision in design increases the occurrence of the concrete-slab and decreases that of t -steel - girder bridge. From the viewpoint of economy, this is highly desirable </seg>

Grade Separations. Four railroad viaducts, two railroad sub - ways, and one highway grade separation structure were designed during this two-year period. The Fairmont viaduct which separates Highway No. 81 from Highway No. 6 and the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad is probably the outstanding rural separation structure designed during this biennium. This is a six-span structure, having a total length of 317 feet, and the cost was $27,392.30. The Brownson viaduct was designed after the issuance of the Priorities Critical List, and the plans do not call for the use of any critical materials. It is of treated-timber trestle construction with 4-inch laminated wood floor, 352 feet 11 inches long, and the contract price was $30,927.45. This structure carries the access road to the i </seg>

Due to the shortage of both structural and reinforcing steel, remodeling and repair of existing structures to accomodate new traffic conditions and grade revisions was twice that done in the previous biennium. Four major projects involving structures were undertaken during this two-year period. Typical of this is the reconstruction work designed for Project No. 205-B (3) on the Superior-Franklin road.

As far as possible, structural steel items on existing sub-structure construction Ayere used in the new designs to the end that a minimum amount of new steel was used. Roadside Improvement. The program of roadside improvement, begun by the Department of Roads and Irrigation in 1934, was con - tinued during the biennium except -for curtailment of the activity in 1942 to, work which was incompleted" during the year 1941. The advent of this country into a state of war brought about a cessation of the regular program, and permitted soil erosion treatment of access roads only.

Five projects featured side strip planting through open countryside, a type of work which has always created enthusiastic public response in the past. All projects included seeding with native and introduced grasses under a wide variation of environment. A spring located on Highway No. 34 east of Benkelman, long a relief for thirsty travelers and later rendered unusable by highway relocation, was restored and given satisfactory setting. Difficult of treatment because of a side hill outlet considerably below highway grade, the solution of the problem was obtained by means of flights of steps leading down to an ornamental concrete structure at the base of a half bowl shaped depression. Inclusion of adequate parking facilities and landscape treatment to provide necessary midday shelter should make this once again a favored spot. The second highway recreational area included improvement of a borrow pit and areas adjacent to the new viaduct at the junction of Highways No. 30 and No. 92, near Clarks, Nebraska. The site, twenty-eight acres in extent and including a small lake, offered a most desired opportunity for development of a roadside park such as would be required for the great volume of traffic that is carried by j . fc </seg>

During the biennium the Public^ Roads Administration announced the availability of a fund to be expended for the acquisition of lands, adjacent to highways, which have a special landscape and traffic - service value. Although this program was postponed for the time being, the Department was able to conduct a state-wide survey in search of locations that would satisfy requirements. This survey revealed such a dirth of natural resources and tree life—many of the latter haying been drought killed—that it would seem an immediate necessity that steps be taken to preserve what exists or has survived, and that careful consideration be given to their increase in the future.

The design of this interchange makes possible the movement of vehicles between the two highways involved with a minimum amount of cross traffic! with separation of opposing traffic, channelization of vehicles, and speed reduction for maximum safety! . The major design problem in which this section participated was the Fort Crook-Omaha access road with especial consideration to the main intersection and the Avery intersection. The main intersection was complicated by the presence of arailroad overpass and the traffic demand for a heavy left turn movement These intersections in ad - dition to. the provision of special turning lanes and storage accomoda - tions were abo equipped with full actuated traffic control signals. The signal arrangement at the main intersection included a centred suspended type of unit operating in conjunction with supplemental pedestal type units. Other intersection problems were studied at the Nebraska Ord - nance Plant, the Lincoln Air Base and the Naval Ammunition Depot. Our Nebraska war activities have created many highway problems in the vicinity of our war industries, and army cantonments. Large traffic volumes concentrated during short periods of time have con - gested sections of highways which were not intended to carry such * loads. The traffic section has made exhaustive studies at these loca - tions and has with the co-operation of the Division of Maintenance, provided warning signs, speed control signs, and other signs, which have aided greatly in the handling of these peak periods. During the year of 1941 many other speed zones were established in the interest of public safety. These, for the most part, were in the transitional sections of a national 35-mile per hour speed limit. All signs stipulating speeds greater than this have either been removed or replaced to so conform. 1 In addition to the traffic signals designed for the Fort Crook- Omaha access road, the traffic; engineering section also prepared plans and specifications for three additional traffic actuated signal installa - tions located on Highway No. 275 near Omaha, frequent operational studies and inspections were made at the nine other traffic signal installations already: functioning. ! In May of 1941, supervision of the junction directional and distance signsand thei roadway markihgactivities were delegated to the traffic engineering section by the Maintenance Division. These activities in - cludethe design andfpiacement; of junction, du-ectional, and distance markers, the painting, of centerline, "no passing!' zones and special markings. A revision of the policy for the design and placement of junction directional and distance markers has been initiated. This system directs traffic over the best and shortest route between points of origin and destination irrespective of route markers. A maximum of four town names is all that is permitted on the theory that this is as many as can be read at prevailing highway speeds. This new policy in </seg>

Sighs are being changed to conform to the new plan only as fast as replacements are necessary. During the first ten months of 1942,11 percent of all guide signs were revised effecting a saving of 440 unnecessary '-postings. It is estimated that a total of 4,000 individual sign boards will be elimi - nated by this program, During 1941, 3,160 miles of centerline were painted, 1,120 miles of which were on concrete pavement and brick where a black center - line is used, and 2,040 miles of which were on bituminoussurfaces where the centerline is painted white. In 1942, due to a'shortage of paint, it was necessary to reduce the number of miles of centerline painted. Major routes and those highways near war plants where traffic was heavy "were given first' consideration. In order to save white paint, an intermittent stripa was used on the bituminous surfaces. Pontiriuing the policy started in 1940 of establishing and marking "no passing" zones on the more L important highways, zones were established on 1,368 additional miles in 1941; this added to the miles zoned in 1940 brings to 2,689 the number of miles where the zones have been established. .Of the &lt; 2j£B9 miles, zones were striped on ' 1,939 miles using yellow paint for The barrier line. Again, due to inability to obtain paint, it was necessary in 1942 to reduce the number of zones painted, and only on the major routes and near war plants were the zones repainted.. Special markings, painted during the past two years have included turnjng lanes and stop lines at channelized intersections, reflectorized regulatory messages on the pavement surface, and reflectorized pro - tectipn lines. of the complaints and requests in regard to traffic highway conditions received by the Department through either the field or office administrative personnel were handled by this section. This was accomplished through contacting the individuals involved or by correspondence. In many cases, complete traffic surveys of the con - ditiohs were necessary and conclusions as to the need for remedial measures-were arrived, at on this basis. The study of high frequency traffic accident locations is an impor - tant function of this section. This is made possible through the analysis of traffic accident reports. 'Whenever five or more, traffic accidents are noted on the spot map as having occurred at one location, or complaints are received indicating a hazardous situation, a study is begun and an effort is made to determine the cause and to cor - rect the trouble.

         <seg id="p139">Division of Office Engineering ; On January 9, 1941, the name of the Division of Office Adminis - tration was changed to the Division of Office Engineering. At ap - proximately the same time the duties involved in checking final computations and final estimates for completed work were transferred to the Division of Construction and the responsibility for purchasing, issuing and repairing engineering equipment was delegated to the Divisiohfof Adniiriistra^tion. The primary functions of this Division are those that are involved in calling for and receiving bids for work which is to be performed by contract. OtherfunctionsJmclude blue printing, purchasing and distributing general office supplies, and posting all outgoing mail. The work that this Division performs in connection -with receiving bids includes preparing and arranging for the publication of all notices to contractors in accordance with the^ pertmeht statutory reqiiirements, transmitting copies of the notices to interested persons, preparing and issuing proposal forms, furnishing blue prints of plans, performing all clerical work necessary for the proper administration of the law requiring the pre-qualification of bidders, receiving and tabulating the bids, and providing: the estimates which are required for the preparation of the "project agreements", or contracts with the United States Public Roa(ls Administration, for all projects that will in - volve the expenditure of Federalvfunds. Proposal forms for bidding on contracts for any.work, except that which is to be paid for solely with maintenance funds, are issued only to qualified bidders and then only upon receipt of a formal ap - plication, on a form that the Department has provided for the purpose, which includes an affidavit that gives the status of all work which the.applicant currently has under contract and also reports any work for which the applicant is the low bidder. No bidding blank for any such work can be issued, unless the formal application is filed with the Department before. 5:00 o'clock P.M. of the day immediately prior to the date of receiving bids for the work that is contemplated in the bidding blank. Blue prints of the plans for work that is to be let to contract are furnished those who request them upon payment of the estimated cost of preparing the prints. One complete set of prints of the plans for the work in any county is sent to the county clerk of the county in which the proposed work is to be performed, for examination by prospective bidders or other interested persons. Another complete set of prints of the plans is made available for in- 127 </seg>
         <seg id="p140">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER spection at the office of the District Engineer who is expected to supervise the proposed work, except that prints are not displayed for that purpose in either of the two District offices that are located in the State Capitol. Complete sets of prints of the plans for all work for which the Department receives bids also are displayed for inspec - tion in the main office in the State Capitol. The Statutes of Nebraska provide that any person who desires to submit to the Department of Roads and Irrigation, a bid for the per - formance of any contract for the construction, reconstruction and im - provement of roads, bridges and their appurtenances shall apply to the Department for pre-qualification not later than one week before the letting of the contract. Upon receipt of each such application which is prepared in accordance with all statutory requirements that apply, the Department establishes a qualification rating which stipu - lates the class or classes of work for which the contractor may submit bids as well as the total amount of contracts for which the bids may be submitted, taking into account the estimated cost of all unfinished work that the contractor may have under contract when he desires to bid on contracts for any additional work. A list which shows the names and addresses of all qualified con - tractors and the class or classes of work for which each contractor is qualified to submit proposals is prepared by this Division before each letting. One hundred thirty-five contractors were qualified in accordance with the above mentioned statutory requirements, January 1, 1941. In spite of the fact that twenty-one other contractors were qualified sub - sequently, the total number of contractors who were qualified October 20, 1942, was reduced to seventy-nine. One factor to which the reduc - tion in the number of qualified contractors may be attributed is the fact that a contractor's qualification rating lapses whenever he fails to comply with a request for a new statement of his financial condition that may be made by the Department at a time when there is evi - dence of a change in his financial condition, or when the statement of his financial condition that is a part of his application is of a date fifteen months prior. Another, and probably the greater, cause of this condition is the fact that the volume of work that the Department let to contract in 1942 was much smaller than the volume of work for which contracts were awarded in other years. All bids are sorted, opened, read, and tabulated publicly as soon as possible after the time set for receiving the bids. The low bids are determined after calculating the total amount of each bid The Dis - trict Engineer of the United States Public Roads Administration :is asked to concur in the selection of the low bidder to whom a contract for any work that will involve the expenditure of funds that are ad - ministered by his office should be awarded, if the low bid is satisfac- </seg>

All supplies are purchased through the office of the State Purchasing Agent; Most of the general office sup - plies are ordered once, each quarter which makes it necessary to estimate the needs of the Department in advance. Supplies that are not ordered in that manner generally are those that are different from the supplies.that normally are used in other offices in the Capitol, as well as those that would deteriorate if they were kept hi stock for three months. All outgoing mail from the offices of the Department of Roads and Irrigation in the State Capitol is posted by this Division. This practice results in a considerable saving in the cost of postage in that all first class mail that is directed to any individual and originates any one day in separate offices is forwarded in a single package whenever it is practicable to do so. </seg>

         <seg id="p143">Division of Construction The Division of Construction is responsible for all construction work performed by contract or direct labor methods. This Division, under the jurisdiction of the Chief Highway Engineer, is constituted as shown in the accompanying organization and activity chart. ACTIVITIES Supervision of Work Performed by Contract. After the contract has been awarded; a Senior or ah Associate Engineer is assigned to directly supervise the work. He is assisted by engineers and inspectors necessary to set lines and grades, to properly supervise all of the contractor's operations, and to make necessary field tests. Construction operations are underthe general supervision of the District Engineer, who is directly responsible to the Construction Engineer. The field inspection and testing of all materials and the proportioning of stabi - lized soil base course and bituminous surface course mixtures are directed by the Materials Engineer. The inspection of all planting in connection with roadside improvement work is directed by the Land - scape Engineer. ':-... The Construction Engineer authorizes all changes in plans and extra work, and approves all force account agreements and supple - mental agreements before work which is not included in the contract is performed. Supervision of Work Performed by Direct Labor. Work is under - taken on a direct labor basis when construction by contract is not considered feasible or when the Department does not receive satisfac - tory bids for the work. A}l major items of required material are purchased through the//State Purchasing Agent at prices established by competitive bidding. Some minor items of material are purchased locally by the District Engineer after receiving bids from individuals or firms in the vicinity in which the work is to be performed. If it is justified by the importance and magnitude of the work, a Senior or an Associate Engineer is assigned to supervise and direct all operations. The work is performed in accordance with the Specifi - cations governing contract work.

         <seg id="p144">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER equipment available in the field are tested on the project. Other materials are sampled and tested at the source of supply by a repre - sentative of the Division of Tests. Samples of materials, delivered on the project without previous tests, and which cannot be tested with field equipment, are submitted to the testing laboratory. Samples of all materials tested at the source of supply or on the project are sent to the testing laboratory periodically for check tests or for a more complete analysis. Contractors' Estimates. Contractors' progress estimates providing for payment for ninety percent of the total value of the work com - pleted on the date of the estimate are prepared each month by the engineer in charge and submitted to the District Engineer for approval. The District Engineer forwards the estimate to the Construction Engineer for approval, after which it is passed to the Division of Records and Control for payment. After the project has been completed in accordance with the plans and specifications and accepted by the District Engineer, the engineer in charge carefully measures and computes the quantities of the various items of work performed. A contractor's final estimate in - cluding these quantities is prepared and submitted to the District Engineer for approval. All project records and computations are submitted directly to the Construction Engineer. The final estimate and all of the project records and computations are reviewed and checked in the office of the construction estimate engineer. After the quantities have been approved by the construc - tion estimate engineer, the tests have been approved by the Materials Engineer, and any necessary deductions have been made for liquidated damages incurred, the estimate is approved by the Construction Engineer and passed to the Division of Records and Control for pay - ment. Transcript of Contractors' Labor Pay Rolls. Provisions are in - cluded in all contracts relative to minimum wages and the manner of employing workmen. In order to check the contractors' compliance with these provisions, the contractors are required to submit certified transcripts of their labor pay rolls. These transcripts are checked in the office of the Construction Engineer, and copies of all transcripts from projects on which Federal funds are expended are sent to the District office of the Public Roads Administration.

Because of the scarcity of some materials, the Office of Production Management set up a priority, system. Priori - ties Regulation No. 1 was issued by the Director of Priorities on August 27,1941. This regulation established provisions and definitions applicable to the operation of the priorities system. General Administrative Memorandum No. 134 was issued on Sep - tember 2 by the Public Roads Administration, establishing a pre - ference rating procedure: applying to highway projects. Under this procedure the Department made application to the Office of Production Management, throughthe Publicßoads Administration, for project preference rating orders covering all projects then under construction or for which plans had been maide to receive bids. Preference Rating Orders P-19-a were issued bythe Office of Production Management on September 27, 1941, assigning preference ratings to approved projects in accordance with the importance of the project. Access roads were assigned a pfeference rating of A-l-e, the strategic network A-4, the Federal-aid system A-7, and the Federal-aid secondary system and State projects A-10; These preference ratings could be extended only for the delivery of material listed in the Priorities Critical List and then only if the material to be delivered could not be secured without such preference rating. In October, 1941, the P-19-a Preference Rating Orders were re - placed by P-19-e Orders. The P-19-e orders could be extended to any material which would be physically incorporated into the project whereas the P-19-a orders were limited to items on the Priorities Critical list. The P-19-e order could not be extended to the purchase of new equipment unless similar equipment was not available for leasing, renting, or otherwise on a temporary basis. Preference Rating Order No. P-22 was issued in September, 1941. The original order provided a; rating of A-I'o for the delivery of repair parts for highway maintenance. However, this order was amended in October and November so that it could be extended by any governmental unit and by highway contractors for the delivery of repairs, maintenance arid supplies. The Pr 22 order was replaced in December, 1941, by Preference Rating Order P-100 which assigns a preference rating of A-10 and is still in effect. The P-100 order may be used by the Department to repair arid maintain its buildings and equipment, to obtain operating supplies, except fuel, and to obtain materials to be physically incorpo - rated into the repair of highways, bridges, or other property. It may also be used by contractors on highway construction or maintenance </seg>
         <seg id="p146">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER to repair and maintain equipment owned or leased by them and to obtain operating supplies, except fuel. Amendment No. 1 to Preference Rating Order P-19-e was issued . in March, 1942. This amendment prohibited the use of the P-19-e order to obtain delivery of construction equipment units. Use of these orders was now limited to the procurement of materials to be physi - cally incorporated into the project and repair parts for equipment in use on the project, when such parts could not be obtained with Preference Rating Order P-100. New construction equipment could now be obtained only by ap - plying to the War Production Board on Application Form PD-la for an individual preference rating certificate covering the particular piece of equipment. In March, 1942, all applicants for project preference ratmg orders were requested to prepare material lists in complete detail, including such items as dynamite, nails, tie wire, form lumber, material for temporary detour structures, and material for the relocation of affec - ted utility lines. Applicants were also requested to give careful con - sideration to material quantities and costs, as all P-19-e orders bemg issued would be limited as to the total value of extensions which could be made. The War Production Board on April 9, 1942, called a halt to non - essential construction through the issuance of Conservation Order L-41. This order prohibited the starting of any highway construction pro - ject estimated to cost more than $5,000 in any consecutive 12-month period unless a P-19-e Preference Rating Order was issued for the project or specific authorization was obtained from the Director of Industry Operations. . Authority to begin construction under Conservation Order L-41, Serial No L-41-600, was issued to all road departments on May 8,1942. This order authorized the beginning of construction on any road pro - ject prohibited under Conservation Order L-41, provided that the project did not require priority assistance, did not require incorporation of any steel reinforcing bars, steel culverts or structural steel, unless such steel was owned or had been ordered on or before May 8,1942, and with further provision that the Department file by the 10th day of each month with the District Engineer of the Public Roads Administra - tion a report showing "Estimate of Materials" required in order to complete all projects to which this Authority L-41-600 applied and upon which construction was started the previous month. Limitation Order No. L-121, issued by the War Production Board on May 13 1942, prohibited the delivery of construction lumber for use in highway construction. This order was originally placed in effect for a period of 60 days but this period was later extended to August 27 1942, at which time it was revoked and replaced with Conservation Order No. M-208. Authorization PD-423, issued June 22, 1942, permitted the delivery of construction lumber pursuant to Luni- </seg>
         <seg id="p147">BUREAU OF HIGHWAYS tation Order L-121 for use in the construction of highway projects which were covered by P-19-e preference rating orders and which had been certified as essent: al to the national defense by the Army, Navy, or War Production B( ard. Authorization PD-423 also expired on August 27,1942, the effective date of Conservation Order M-208. The M-208 Order established various classes of lumber and lumber users, and assigned a preference rating of A-l-a for lumber used in the construction of highways and bridges. This rating, however, could not obtain delivery of softwood lumber in a better grade than No. 1 Common, whereas our Specifications call for the use of various struc - tural grades of lumber. The latest restriction in the use of softwood lumber, Amendment 1 to Conservation Order M-208, issued September 11, 1942, prohibits the lse of a preference rating for replacement in inventory of softwood lumber delivered for use in highway construc - tion. At the present writing, it is questionable whether the Department will be able to obtain delivery of even the common grades of softwood lumber under restrictions now in effect. Pursuant to RecomnendationNo. 45, Amendment, issued July 2, 1942, no bituminous mauerial could be delivered after July 12, 1942, or used after July 22, 194:!, in the construction or repair of any public road, street, highway, etc., unless a Certificate of Necessity for the use of bituminous road material was issued by the Public Roads Adminis - tration. These certificates have been issued for the construction of only the most essential road projects, and the delivery of bituminous materials is being considerably delayed even for these essential projects. i New restrictions wjsre placed on, ttie delivery: of steel and iron products oh August 1, These orders prohibited warehouses and dealers from making delivery of more steel and iron products except on orders bearing a preference rating of Arl-a or higher. As a result, the Department was no 1 longer able to obtain delivery of reinforcing or structural steel as our highestpreference rating was A-l-e. On August 17,1942, we were advised bythe Public Roads Administration that definite quarterly allocations would be made of steel and iron products for the most essential highway construction, and we were requested to submit aii estimated tabulation of our needs for the third and fourth.quart);rs of 1942. Following the submittal of our requirements,; six ; ofth4:most essential access and strategic network road projects were re-rated/ assigning an AA-2X rating to the de - livery of reinforcing steel, and AA-3 rating for structural steel, and an AA-4 rating,for nails,: hardware and other steel and iron items. Cement has not been placed under governmental regulation at this writing; however, the supply is considerably below the demand in this area, and the cement companies have attempted to fill orders in accordance with the preference ratings assigned to various pro - jects. It now appears that very little cement will be available for highway construction in the hear future. </seg>
         <seg id="p148">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER The highway construction program for the past biennium, which is further described elsewhere, has been considerably restricted because of the increasing scarcity of materials, equipment, and labor. CONSTRUCTION BY CONTRACT There were 194 contracts for construction work in 68 counties awarded during 1941, and 24 contracts for construction work in 17 counties awarded during the first 10 months of 1942. The work completed during the biennium up to November 1, 1942," is summarized in Table 16.

Earthwork. There were no major changes in the Specifications for earthwork during the biennium. All embankments on which it was anticipated that a surfacing of a higher type than gravel would be placed were required to be constructed with specified moisture contents and compacted to specified densities.

         <seg id="p151">BUREAU OF HIGHWAYS another paved route to the bomber plant, this project further relieves the traffic congestion 01 Highway No. 73 and No. 75. Also constructed in 1941 were 16.5 miles of 20-foot concrete pave - ment between Lincoln and Seward, 1.4 miles of 20-foot concrete pavement between Elkhorn and Highway No. 30 and 4.8 miles of municipal pavement on the streets of fifteen cities and villages. The pavement constructed between Seward and Lincoln provided for the relocation of Highway 34 and No. 2 between Lincoln and Seward, thereby diverting considerable traffic from Highway No. G west of Lincoln. The concrete pavirig work undertaken during 1942 was confined to approximately 8.7 miles of access roads to the Nebraska Ordnance Plant near Mead and the United States Aviation Technical Training Center near Lincoln. The largest of these projects is that between Lincoln and Emerald which provides for the construction of approxi - mately 3.9 miles of divided four-lane pavement between Lincoln and a point 2 miles south of the training center, 1.7 miles of two-lane pavement between Emerald and the training center approach road, and approximately one-half mile of municipal pavement in Emerald and Lincoln. Because of the scarcity of critical materials required to construct a permanent bridge over Middle creek just east of Emerald, approximately one-third of* a mile of this road will be sur - faced with a temporary bituminous pavement until such time as materials required to construct an adequate stream crossing are avail - able. This project will replace the narrow brick pavement between Lincoln and Emerald and provide a second paved route between 'Lincoln and the training center, thus relieving the traffic congestion on Highway No. 34 between Lincoln and the north entrance to the training center. Bituminous-Mai Surface Course. There were no major changes made in the specifications for bituminous mat surface courses during the biennium. There were 80.4 miles of bituminous mat surface course completed during 1941 and the first ten months of 1942. The bituminous mat completed in 1941 consisted of 0.4 of a mile in Crawford and 8.7 miles west of Crawford on Highway No. 20, 14.7 miles between Lisco ar d Northport on No. 26N, 4.5 miles north of Norfolk on No. 81, 10.2 miles south of Valentine on No. 83, 12 miles between Alliance and Chadron and 18.2 miles between Chadron and Wayside on No. 19, and :.0.4 miles south of Madison on No. 81. The bituminous mat completed in 1942 consisted of 1.3 miles of city streets in Loup City and Greeley. A contract was awarded for the construction of 14.5 miles of bituminous mat surface course on Highway No. 81 between the junction approximately 5 miles northwest of Columbus and Humphrey. However, due to restrictions placed on the use of asphaltic olils, this construction has been postponed until these materials are available. </seg>
         <seg id="p152">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER Stabilized Base Courses. A stabilized base course is a well graded combination of mineral aggregates, local sands and local soils, to which a stabilizing admixture may be added, uniformly mixed, moistened, laid and compacted. After the application of a prime coat, a bituminous mat may be constructed to serve as a surface course. Often on highways where the traffic is light only an armor coat is applied as a surface course. Admixtures of asphaltic oil, emulsified asphalt, tar or Portland cement may be used as stabilizing agents. Base courses constructed without admixtures depend almost entirely upon the proper gradation of the aggregates and the balanced relation of sand, clay and silt in the mixture to furnish the necessary stability and durability. Generally speaking, stabilized soil base courses are divided into three classes, those without admixtures being identified as stabilized soil base courses, those with admixtures being identified as bituminous stabilized base courses or soil-cement base courses, depending upon the stabilizing agent used. A total of 165.9 miles of stabilized base course were completed during the biennium, of which 23.7 miles were bituminous stabilized base course, and 142.2 miles were stabilized soil base course. No soil-cement base courses were constructed in 1941. Contracts were awarded for 7.3 miles of'this type of construction north of Fairmont and 14.5 miles south of Humphrey, all on Highway No. 81, in 1942. It was anticipated that a bituminous mat surface course would be constructed over these base courses. However, since the use of asphaltic oils has been restricted, it will be necessary to apply prime and armor coats to the base course and delay construction of 1 the surface course. At the time these projects were awarded, cement was not considered a critical material. Late in the summer it became apparent that producers could not furnish all of the cement required in the construction essential to the war effort and also that required for construction of less essential projects. For this reason the delivery of cement to these projects has been curtailed to such an extent that it will be impossible to complete the work during the 1942 construction season. If cement is available, these projects will be completed as soon as weather conditions will permit work to be resumed in 1943. Sand-Gravel Surface Compaction. There were 37.8 miles of sand-gravel surface compacted during 1941 and 27.6 miles compacted j during 1942. This type of construction was first undertaken this biennium and consists of a moisture compacted layer of sand gravel and soil from the subgrade. \ « A quantity of soil, approximately 20 per cent to 25 per cent of | the total volume of sand gravel into which the soil is to be mixed, ' is taken up from the roadbed by scarifying or blading and placed in ' a windrow or spread loosely over the surface of the roadbed. The soil i and the sand gravel are mixed sufficiently to insure proper binding \ </seg>
         <seg id="p153">BjUREAU OP HIGHWAYS of all particles within the mixture. After 1 the mixing has been com - pleted, the combined rAaterials are spread uniformly over the surface of the roadbed, water, is added, and the mixture compacted with sheepsfoot or pneums tic-tired rollers. The rolling operations are supplemented by blading to insure finishing the surface to the lines and grades shown in the plans. This type of surface has proven to be an improvement over the usual traffic-compacted gravel surface in that it is easier to maintain and provides a more stable and smoother riding surface. A consider - able mileage of this tfoe of surface has been constructed by direct labor methods. Bituminous Surface Treatment. This type of construction in - volves the application rf various types of liquid bituminous material to subgrades, stabilized soil base courses, bituminous mat surface courses, and concrete pavements to seal the surface, prevent ravelling and/or provide a weabing surface. Bituminous surface treatments are divided into two classes; namely, prime coats and armor coats. A prime coat consists of an application of low viscosity asphaltic oil, tar or emulsified asshalt to the previously prepared base, roadbed or existing surface. The surface to be treated is cleaned thoroughly by blading and broomiig the loose material to the shoulder and the oil is applied directly :o the surface. The purpose of a prime coat is to penetrate, harder, and consolidate any loose particles so that the wearing surface to be applied later will be firmly bonded to the underlying roadbed. Prime coats are ai plied directly to the existing roadbed or the stabilized soil base course prior to the construction of a bituminous surface course pavemerit or to the application of an armor coat. An armor coat consists of an application of rapid curing asphaltic oil, tar, or emulsified asphalt and a coat or covering of sand gravel which is consolidated bjr rolling. The purpose of fee armor coat is to seal the surface and provide a wearing course. Armor coats are apblied on existing roadbeds, stabilized-soil base courses or bituminous-ijtiat; surface courses, depending upon the type of improvement desired. Armor coats are often applied directly to bituminous-mat surfacd courses and concrete pavements which are cracking and showing Evidence of ravelling to seal the surface and provide a wearing surface. Prime coats and armor coats applied on stabilized base courses are normally applied by the contractor constructing the base course Armor coats on pavements are usually applied by direct labor methods! Drainage Structures. There were no significant changes made in the specifications for culverts and bridges during the biennium. Most of the concrete structures for which contracts were awarded iii 1942 were designed without steel reinforcement where such construe- </seg>
         <seg id="p154">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER tion was feasible. Unreinforced concrete arch culverts were con - structed in lieu of large box culverts, all smaller box culverts were constructed without steel reinforcement and where it was not feasible to eliminate the use of reinforcing entirely, its use was restricted to the minimum requirements. There were no unusual structures built during the biennium. The only major river crossing constructed was the 650-foot multiple span deck steel girder bridge over the Republican River south of Ara - pahoe. All other structures were the usual bridge and culvert con - struction over smaller drainage channels. Grade Separations. Eight grade separations were completed during the biennium. Five of these structures, a viaduct on Highway ¦P?:v r ¦.?' am Viaduct Carrying Highway No. 81 over No. 6 and the I Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad at Fairmont i No. 38 near Ak-Sar-Ben Field in Omaha, a viaduct on No. 6 near i Hastings, a viaduct on an important feeder road near Plattsmouth, ! a subway on No. 73 on 30th street in Omaha, and an underpass on i No. 73 and 75 near the Fort Crook Bomber Plant, separate railroad I and highway grades. The structure near the bomber plant separates I the grade of the railroad spur to the bomber plant and the highway. ; Viaducts constructed near Fairmont and Elkhorn eliminate a &lt; highway grade crossing as well as a railroad grade crossing.

Flashing Light Sis nali. In conjunction with the Public Roads Administration and the various railroads, flashing light warning signals were installed at 31 rjailroad grade, crossings during the biennium. The materials were furAished and the signals installed by.the railroads. Reimbursement was made to the companies from Federal funds for the costs incurred in fui nishing the materials and performing the work. CONST] lUCTION BY DIRECT LABOR Work was undertaken by direct labor methods on 85 projects during 1941, and 81 projects between January 1, 1942, and November 1,1942. This work ma* be divided into several classes:— Projects on which it was impossible to secure satisfactory bids, projects on which it was impossible to secure any bids, projects involving small quanti - ties of the various itenu of work for which it is not considered feasible to advertise for bids, reconstruction work involving salvaging and re-use of existing materials in the road, emergency work which could not be delayed far the time required to advertise and receive bids, experimental projects, and work incidental to the completion of contract work, such as the installation of reflectorized railroad crossing signs. Table 18 shows the various classes of work performed by direct labor, the number of p:ojects on which each class of work was per - formed, and the mileag; of each class of work undertaken during the biennium. The total r umber of projects shown in the summary is not comparable to those shown above because, in a number of instan - ces, several classes of vrork were performed on one project. The most interest! lg projects built by direct labor during the biennium were experimental projects constructed between Lincoln and Ashland, between Syracuse and Dunbar, and between Beatrice and Fairbury. The projects between Lincoln and Ashland involved the construc - tion of 2.8 miles of bituminous surfacing on badly cracked and deteriorated concrete lavement. Since we did'not have previous experience in resurfacing failing concrete pavements on which to base* a determination of the ype and thickness of surfacing material to be used, short experimental sections of varying thickness of both hot - mixed asphaltic concrete and standard road-mixed bituminous mat surface course were constructed. Resurfacing the pavement with either of these materials seals the crack and prevents water from reaching the subgrade through the pavement, provides a smooth riding surface and adds strength to the pavement by increasing' its thickness.

The projects between Syracuse and Dunbar and between Beatrice and Fairbury involved the construction of 2.3 miles of cement-bound macadam foundation course, 16.7 miles of crushed-rock foundation course, and 3.4 miles of crushed-rock shoulder stabilization at locations where the stabilized soil base was breaking up due to frost boils and other subgrade failures. Cement-bound macadam was constructed through cuts where the drainage was poor, the stability of the subgrade was low and a strong stable foundation course was required. Crushed rock foundation courses of varying thicknesses were constructed at locations where the subgrade failures were less serious and a lower type foundation course would be satisfactory. In other sections where only the shoulders were failing, crushed rock was incorporated in the shoulders to add stability. Cement-bound macadam consists of a mixture of clean, coarse ag - gregate bound together with a cement-sand grout that is poured onto the surface of the compacted aggregate until all voids in the' mass have been filled.

This type of construction is more economical than a concrete base course in localities where crushed rock or other coarse aggregates are available, because the refinements of the construction procedure are not so high and the use of batching plants, paving mixers, and other expensive equipment is not required. The cement-bound macadam constructed during 1942 was the first construction of this tjr &gt;c in the State. The foundation courses of this type constructed during the past year will be observed and the results considered when higher type base or foundation courses are designed in the future. It was necessary to construct several access roads to military and war industry est iblishments by direct labor methods because satisfactory bids were not received when the work was advertised and bidding proposals requested. The work performed on such roads consisted of the constiuction of 0.5 mile of grading, culverts, bitumi - nous stabilized base course, bituminous-mat surface course, prime coat and armor coat on the road between Grand Island and the Cornhusker Ordnance Plant, 1.5 miles of grading, compacted sand-gravel surface course, prime coat and armor coat between Alda and the Cornhusker Ordnance Plant, and l.i»mile of grading and culverts between Highway No. 2 south of Alliance and the Air Support Glider Base. Construction by means of direct labor was hampered during 1942 by the difficulty encoi inter ed in securing materials due to priorities restrictions and the scircity of labor and equipment due to the vast numbers of both men and machinery engaged in the construction of military, naval, and var industry establishments in the State. For these reasons some w&lt;rk was deferred, and the progress on projects undertaken was delayed; however, it appears that all essential work will be completed before the end of the year. </seg>

         <seg id="p167">Division of Materials FUNCTIONS AND ORGANIZATION The principal functions of the Materials Division pertain to investi - gation and approval of materials utilized in highway construction and maintenance. Major activities involved in the performance of these functions include the following: Investigation of subgrade conditions; discovery of suitable local materials; preparation of designs adaptable to local conditions and materials, which are available economically; preparation of specifications for materials and construction operations; supervision of field testing and inspection; review of reports from the testing laboratory of the Department and from other testing agencies to establish acceptability of materials; and approval of estimates and purchase orders for acceptable materials. The detailed office work and some of the specially assigned field tasks are performed by engineers and assistants working directly under the supervision of the Materials Engineer. The routine field work is done by engineers and assistants working under the super - vision of the eight district engineers. ' Because of the nature of the duties of the Materials Division, it is necessary that all operations be closely co-ordinated with several of the other Divisions of the Department. The major activities of the Division can be divided into two general groups: "design" and "con - struction and maintenance activities", both of which are carried on in collaboration with the heads of the various Divisions involved. DESIGN ACTIVITIES Probably the most extensive design activity of the Materials Division is the investigation and analysis involved in soil and materials surveys. These investigations are started upon advisement from the Design Engineer that the alignment of a proposed highway has been tentatively established and that soil and materials data is required for completion of the plans. A subgrade survey is generally required for all primary roads and for certain secondary roads which are to be provided with high type surfacing. The thoroughness of the investi - gations varies considerably. In some cases, where conditions are known to be relatively uniform, a review of previously obtained data is considered to be adequate, while in other cases it has been necessary for a field party to establish headquarters on the site of the work and spend several weeks investigating various characteristics of the local soils and the materials conditions. J The preliminary soils and materials surveys coyer three major phases of investigation. First of these is the assembling of general 155 </seg>
         <seg id="p168">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER information regarding the soil on the project to determine its suita - bility for embankment and subgrade construction. The second phase involves more detailed information regarding localized areas which are being studied, particularly with respect to foundation conditions and to possible internal drainage difficulties. The third phase involves a reconnaissance of the general area for information regarding the availability of aggregates and selected soils which could be used economically in the subgrade or proposed base course or surface course. In some cases the field work consists only of making borings and taking samples which are submitted to the testing laboratory at Lincoln for detailed analysis. On other projects, especially those which are of appreciable length, a field testing laboratory is established and a large percentage of the routine tests are made as the samples are taken. In this manner the soils technician is better able to correlate his field observations with the actual test data for the soil samples. In all cases, however, additional samples are submitted to the testing labor - atory at Lincoln as a control on the field testing operations, and for more detailed tests than can be made in the field. When the report of field investigations and results of laboratory tests are available, the data is reviewed and analyzed in the office. On the basis of these studies, the Design Division is furnished with recommendations regarding disposal or use of existing soil materials; the importation of selected soil or aggregate for subgrade improvement; the handling of special sub-drainage situations; the type and thickness of proposed foundation, base, and surface courses; and the availability of local materials which are suitable for the recommended design. After the type of base or surface course to be constructed is determined, the Materials Division works out the details of the pro - posed design. In most cases the test data from the preliminary field investigations is correlated with standard specifications, and the relative proportions of available materials required to provide a satisfactory construction mixture are computed. In some other cases, when the nature of the available materials or the proposed design is not closely related to previous experience, it is necessary that ex - perimental laboratory mixtures be prepared and observed. General information regarding the experimental work is furnished to the Division of Tests, which then proceeds with the investigation and prepares a report of observations and recommendation. The next step, after detailed proportions and designs have been established, is the computation of quantities, determination of estimate prices, and assembly of data regarding local material pits. The tabu - lation quantities and estimated prices is submitted to the Division of Design which then prepares the plans and detail estimate for the proposed work. The information relating to local material pits which the State plans to use, is submitted to the Division of Right of Way for its use in obtaining options for purchase of the material. The </seg>
         <seg id="p169">BUREAU OF HIGHWAYS location and cost of local material pits are shown on the bidding plans so that the Contractor can make an intelligent bid consistent with the actual cost of obtaining the material. Ip so far as possible, the Standard Specifications of the Department are used to prescribe the detailed requirements for; materials and construction operations. These; specifications are issued periodically in order to keep abreast; with the procedures and designs of the major portipn of current work—the specifications now being used were issued in 1937. When the Nebraska Standard Specifications fail to adequately cover the class of material or construction contemplated, the Standard Specifications of the American Association of State Highway Officials and of the American Society of Testing Materials are used in so far as they are applicable. However, for construction involving local materials, it is very often necessary to make minor revisions of specifications to permit the use of local materials which are suitable for the proposed work. It also is necessary to make fre - quent adjustments of specifications for low cost base courses and bituminous surface courses inasmuch as these types of construction are very closely related to local situations and have also been in a state of continual development during the past few [years because they are still comparatively new. The Materials Division prepares such specifications for work which is to-be let to contract, for materials which are to be purchased for the Department through the State Purchasing Agent, and for construction and maintenance of base courses and bituminous! surface courses by State Forces. In order that the performance of highways, as measured by convenience and comfort to the traveling public and by reduction of construction and maintenance costs, may be continually improved, designs are revised in accordance with the latest available data. To this end, the feasibility of current designs pertaining to soils, base courses, and surface courses is investigated by inspection of construc - tion operations. Condition surveys of previously constructed work are made and abnormal performance is investigated in detail to obtain data for correction or reconstruction of failed sections. Quite often a construction project is set up with one or more experimental features, which are studied by the Materials Division during and after construction, to determine the practicability and economy of such features as i regular design practice. CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES One of the major phases of construction and maintenance en - gineering is the testing and inspection of materials in the field. All test and inspection reports are submitted to the Materials Division for review md recommendations as to acceptability or rejection of materials u::ed. This general supervision of testing and inspection </seg>
         <seg id="p170">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER procedures is handled through the engineers and inspectors working under the direction of the eight district engineers. Field inspections by the Materials Engineer or assistants are made periodically to provide a check on the quality of material and the testing procedures. The tests which are commonly made in the field include the following: Compaction, density, and moisture tests of soils used for embankment; gradation, specific gravity, and moisture tests of aggregates; hydro - meter tests of soil composition; soil constants tests; moisture content, bitumen content, aeration, stability, and composition of bituminous aggregate mixtures; and yield weights and rupture strengths of con - crete. In addition to the making of the above tests, the field inspec - tion operations include the sampling of various other materials which are submitted to the Testing Laboratory for detailed investigation. The Materials Division has particularly close contact with con - struction operations involved in proportioning and processing materials for subgrades, base courses, and bituminous surface courses. This is due primarily to the fact that the preliminary investigation and design of these types of work had also been performed by the Materials Division. It also is due to the relatively large amount of testing and inspection necessary to maintain the uniformity and control required for successful results with these types of construction. On most projects of this type, a complete field laboratory with facilities for electric current and running water is established near the site of the work. The testing work is performed by an experienced laboratory technician and one or two assistants who test materials at the local pits. Certain construction procedures, such as the batching and mixing of concrete, applying and mixing of asphaltic oil or Portland cement with soil and aggregate, and other processing operations require considerable inspection and control because the quality of the ultimate mixture is dependent to a great degree on the efficiency of such operations. It has been found desirable to test some materials at the point of production in order that there will be a minimum of delay after the material arrives on the project and in order to eliminate the necessity of job rejection of unsatisfactory materials. The testing and accep - tance of Portland Cement and Asphaltic Oil are ordinarily handled in that manner by the Division of Tests or its authorized agents. That Division also frequently inspects corrugated metal pipe, concrete pipe, and paints at the point of manufacture and thereby facilitates acceptance and use of the materials. Aggregates which are shipped by rail are usually inspected and tested at the pit or source of pro - duction. Acceptance tags are affixed to each car so that the engineer supervising the use of the material will know that the aggregate had been tested and found satisfactory. The inspection of grade of lumber and wood piling, and the inspection and testing of preservative treat - ment is performed at the source of production or treating plant by </seg>
         <seg id="p171">BUREAU OF HIGHWAYS regular commercial inspection agencies upon authorization by the Materials Division. A complete file of all test and inspection reports is maintained in the Lincoln office by the Division of Materials. This file includes the reports preiared by the Division of Tests, and commercial inspection agencies, as well as the reports of field tests and inspections which were made under the supervision of the Materials Division. As con - tracts for constructionjand maintenance are awarded, the contract items are a mlyzed to determine the various materials for which ac - ceptable test reports will be required. During the progress of the work a reccrd is kept ojf the samples submitted and of the tests and inspections made. As progress- estimates, and ultimately final esti - mates, are submitted, reference is made to the record of acceptable material, and if all materials represented by the items for which pay - ment is to bi (made are found to be acceptable, the estimate is approved for paymenl;. If no samples had been tested or if the materials are unsatisfactoiy, approval of the estimate is withheld until evidence of acceptable i laterials is available. A similar procedure is followed in the case of materials purchased for the Department by the State Pur - chasing Agent. </seg>

         <seg id="p173">Division of Tests ORGANIZATION From 1923 until May 1,1942, the Division of Tests was directed by a professor on the faculty of tiie University, who was! designated by the Department of Roads and Irrigation as Testing Engineer. During the school yuar he devoted part of his time to teaching in the Depart - ment of Eni fineering M echanics. Under this arrangement the Uni - versity provided the housing, equipment, supplies and the personnel for the operation of the Division of Tests. The Department of Roads and Irrigation reimbursed the University for its services in accordance with a fixed price schedule for the various tests made' and on a per diem basis for field inspirations and miscellaneous testing and inspect - ing services. ! ¦ ¦ On Mayj 1, 1942 an agreement was made between the Board of Regents of the University of Nebraska and the Department of Roads and Irrigation by which) the(University leased to the Department the laboratory, office space, and equipment required by the Testing Divi - sion. The University is reimbursed for the space and equipment with a rental fee.j The Department maintains the equipment which it has under lease and the University maintains the buildings.; As a result of this arrangement the Testing Division was reorgan - ized and became an integral part of the Department iof Roads and Irrigation. This provides a closer and more direct contact with the other divisions. A former assistant testing engineer was appointed as a full-time Testing Engineer under direct supervision of the Department. j." The Division of Tests is .directed)by the Testing Engineer.

Inspectors are also maintained at refineries which supply considerable quantities of asphaltic oil to the State during the. construction season. Each car of cement and asphaltic oil is tested and accepted by these inspectors at the plants before Molding Pliton and Mold for Cohtilv* Matuiali shipment. Other materials such as concrete pipe, corrugated metal pipe, reinforcing steel, lubricating oil, grease, and paint are inspected and sampled at the fabricating or manufacturing plant by inspectors from, the Division of Tests, and the samples are brought to the Lincoln Laboratory for test. The testing of materials before they are shipped permits their immediate use on arriving at the construction sites, as there is none of the delay which would be caused by waiting for the tests to be made. Commercial testing laboratories are employed by the Department to inspect and test materials when it is advantageous to use their facilities. Shipments of untreated and of treated lumber and of timber piling are generally inspected by commercial testing laboratories at the mill or at the treating plant.

The results of tests which have been made on a number of competitive products are used in the writing of some specifications. </seg>
         <seg id="p179">BUREAU OF HIGHWAYS An important function of the Division of Tests is to keep abreast of all new methods of construction and of the development of new materials used in construction. This requires considerable investiga - tion and research. Some investigations are made of the factors which have caused failures in highway surfacing. Some of the special tests and investigations now being conducted are as follows: ¦ . 1 Tri-Axial Compression Tests. The stabilometer is used for per - forming tri-axial compression tests on soil to determine certain char - acteristics which may be used in the design of subgrades and surfaces. Soil-Cement Mixlurei. Experimental soil-cement mixtures are made up in the laboratory and tested for durability by means of the wetting arid drying test and the freezing and thawing test for most of the proposed projects. Cores have been taken from a number of the soil-cement base courses and checked for density and durability. Asphaltic Oil. Experiments are being made to compare the relative waterproofing qualities of special positive spot asphaltic sta - bilizer oil with that of negative spot asphaltic oils when used in a bituminous stabilized base. Bituminous Mixtures. Experimental bituminous mixtures are made for most proposed projects and tested in the laboratory before the contract is let thus aiding in obtaining data for the proper design. Concrete Curing Compounds. Due to the shortage of burlap as a concrete curing aid, an investigation of the water retention qualities of several concrete curing compounds has been started. Traffic Zone Paint. During the past biennium considerable time has been spent on the study of traffic zone paint. Besides determining the physical and chemical properties of samples of various formula - tions, experimental stripes were painted across sections of both con - crete and bituminous pavement where it was subjected to heavy traffic and to normal weathering. As a result of this study a new specifica - tion has been developed which invites manufacturers of paints to submit samples for test six months in advance of the time that bids may be called for. In addition to meeting specified physical and chemical tests the manufacturers' samples are required to meet a service test similar to that described above. Use of Admixtures in Concrete. An investigation of the use of admixtures in concrete is now underway. Concrete mixtures were prepared with and without different admixtures and with varying amounts of cement, aggregate and water. Compressive strength tests and density determinations are being made on cylinders made up from these mixtures. Concrete Pavement. Considerable study has been made of the map-cracking that is taking place on many concrete pavements. Plans </seg>

         <seg id="p181">BUREAU OF HIGHWAYS With this data, it should be possible to predict the durability of con - crete to a closer degree than is possible at the present time. SUMMARY OF TESTS A summary showing the number of samples of the different materials tested and the number of special tests made each year for the past 14 years is shown in Table 22. This table shows only the number of samples tested and is, of course, not indicative of the amount of work involved, as some tests require considerable time to complete while others may be made in a short time. This table in - cludes only the tests made in the Lincoln laboratory or under the di - rect supervision of the Lincoln laboratory and does not include tests made in the field laboratories on the various projects' or by other testing or inspection agencies. </seg>

         <seg id="p185">J Division of Right of Way The Division of Right of Way was originated in April, 1927. Prior to that time the right of way for State and Federal roads was acquired by the cojinties or by other political sub-divisions. Under the present law the department of Roads and Irrigation has the power to make direct settlement with property owners, or, to have the property con - demned. The tight of way activities range from the purchase of city property with comparatively high value, to farm property with lesser value, and they also include purchases of materials for gravel and bituminous surfacing. Right of way for changing water courses, borrow dirt, and clay surfacing are a2so obtained by the Division of Right of Way. The condemnation law is used only as a last resort. A represen - tative of the Department of Roads and Irrigation always contacts the land owner in an effort to make a direct settlement, but if they are unable to agree as to the amount of damages, the condemnation law is invoked. In direct settlements, payment is made to the land owner, but if the property is acquired through condemnation, payment is made through the court. Until recently the Federal government has not participated in the cost of right of way for State or Federal roads although it has par - ticipated in the payment for borrow dirt which was specifically out - lined in the plans. The Federal government at the present time however, is participating in the cost of right of way for access roads and strategic network highways. During the last year because of the sharp decrease in construction and a corresponding decrease in the purchase of right of way, oc - casioned by the war emergency, we have been able to make payment for all right of way where the projects have been completed, and will be in position hereafter to make practically all right of way payments as soon as the construction contracts have been awarded. All right of way records including contracts with the land owners or their representatives, railroad leases, and right of way deeds, are on file in Lincoln office of the Department of Roads and Irrigation. Expenditures for right of way during this biennium total $777,423.9&amp;, and cover 4533 separate transactions. Table 24 shows the total amount spent for right of way on the State Highway System in each ccjunty and includes road material and channel changes from October lj, 1940, to October 31, 1942, both dates inclusive, and also includes all purchases for which vouchers have been approved. Pay - ment for all right of way is made by the State but the reimbursement 173 </seg>
         <seg id="p186">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER to be made by the Federal government has not been deducted from Table 24 for the reason that the reimbursement is not made until the construction of the project is entirely completed.

         <seg id="p189">Division of Maintenance ACTIVITIES AND ORGANIZATION The purpose of the Division of Maintenance is to keep the high - ways in good condition and to make all necessary repairs in order to provide the users with a safe, comfortable and convenient means for travel and! to protect the original investment or construction cost, so that the most is received from it. All maintenance operations are handled by the Chief Highway Engineer through the Maintenance Engineer, who has general supervi - sion over all maintenance activities in the State. The State is divided into eight districts, comprised of about eleven or twelve counties each, and each under a District Engineer, who is responsible to the Main - tenance Engineer for the maintenance activities in his district. Each of the eight districts is subdivided into maintenance divisions with a chief patrolman, or resident engineer, in charge. There are about five maintenance divisions to each district, the size of each depending upon the type of highway, the amount of traffic, the topography and climatic conditions. Then, finally, that portion of the highway system which is eligible for maintenance is divided into patrol sections of varied lengths. A patrolman with proper equipment is assigned to each patrol. During this biennium, in order to improve the method of supervis - ing maintenance work, a different organization was set up in District No. 3 which is located in the northeast corner of the State. The Dist - rict was divided into two maintenance divisions of approximately equal size with a resident engineer supervising maintenance activities in each division. Divisions were subdivided into four or five main - tenance units with a maintenance foreman directly responsible for all maintenance operations. No changes were made in the patrol layouts. To date this method appears to have advantages over the established organization. Because of the war it cannot be expanded for the dura - tion due to lack of capable men to head it. Another important part of the organization is the mechanical division which keeps the equipment in condition, so that the road main - tenance force can carry on their work without undue delay. The organization of this division has been changed somewhat during this biennium. An equipment engineer has replaced the chief mechanic and has been put in responsible charge of all equipment, its repair, and the mechanical organization. In each of the eight districts there is a district mechanic who works under the District Engineer, and each district is divided into three to four mechanical divisions, each with an assistant mechanic. The assistant mechanics have definite equipment assigned to their care and are held responsible for keeping those pieces in proper repair. The main repair shop is located at Lincoln, where complete motor overhauling jobs and other heavy 177 </seg>
         <seg id="p190">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER work is done for all districts. The work done at Lincoln is of such nature that it would not pay to equip each district repair shop to perform this work. The clerical and statistical work of the organization is central - ized as much as possible in the Lincoln office. Each of the eight dist - ricts has a district clerk who prepares and forwards payrolls for labor and vouchers for materials which must be purchased in the field, to the Lincoln office where they are checked, recorded and for - warded for payment. The Lincoln office keeps records, in itemized form, of the costs of each patrol and each piece of equipment. The information necessary to accomplish this is taken from the daily reports made by each employee as to the type of work done and information regarding equipment operation. It requires approximately 450 regular employees to operate the maintenance organization. More than two-thirds of this number are patrolmen who maintain a certain section of the road assigned to them. Extra laborers are used to do special work of a major nature and the number employed varies considerably throughout the year. EFFECT OF THE WAH The Maintenance Division has encountered many problems with regard to personnel, equipment, materials, supplies, and repair parts since January 1, 1942, due to the war. Construction was started by the Army, early in the year, on a number of war industries in the State, causing an acute shortage of labor. This construction work is still in progress on new developments, and completed industries are now in operation requiring large personnel. The employing of men in war work, in addition to the entry of men from the State into military - service, has caused an acute shortage of all classes of workmen. It was necessary for the Federal Government and Contractors employing men on these industries to pay high wages, and for the most part the common labor wage minimum was sixty cents per hour, with time and a half for any time in excess of forty hours per week. In turn it was necessary for the Department to increase their minimum wage scale. Prior to this condition, the average minimum common labor wage was about thirty-five cents per hour, while at the present time it is about forty-six cents. All other intermediate and skilled grades have had wage increases proportionately. Maintenance opera - tions were of necessity curtailed due to lack of workmen, particularly in the vicinity of the war industries. It has been necessary to delay and even defer considerable necessary routine maintenance work. This situation will have a material effect upon the snow removal, problem this winter. Due to our inability to obtain snow removal equipment operators, we will not be able to operate equipment twenty - four hours a day, as in the past. For the same reason, we will not be able to keep the normal amount of equipment working on the </seg>

Due po the shortage of rubber and steel, it is necessary to apply to the Federal government for priority ratings on items involving the use of either material. While several applications have been made to purchase new equipment, none have been approved.. We have been granted priorities for replacement rubber and steel materials or parts, after, adequately showing that the need was essential to civilian life or the war effort. In many instances, long delays were experienced, "V"-plow Widening Road Through Snowdtlil whici kept a large number of pieces of equipment out of service for unusially long periods. SALVAGE Ipue to the need for a large amount of scrap metal and rubber, in order to carry on the war program the maintenance organization has been! very active collecting and handling scrap materials. Since January 1, 1942, the Highway Department has disposed of 900 tons of scrap metal and 55 tons of scrap rubber. During the October, 1942 campaign, conducted in the State, the Department disposed of another 300 tons of scrap metal. The majority of this scrap was obtained by dismantling obsolete and old equipment which had not been] used to any appreciable extent for a good many years. In addition to collecting this large quantity of scrap within the Department, the men have hauled a large amount of scrap from farms to concentration points during the two campaigns conducted in the State. During the October campaign the Department assumed full responsibility for having scrap hauled from farms to concentration points. A man was assigned to one or two counties in order to see that this hauling was accomplished. </seg>

This additional moisture proved very beneficial to the economical maintenance of smooth, gravel-surfaced highways. During previous exceptionally dry years, it has been necessary to haul large quantities of water to repair chuck holes in </seg>
         <seg id="p193">j BUHEAU OF HIGHWAYS gravel-surfaced highways. These holes develop very rapidly, particu - larly] on clay-surfaced roads. Normal rainfall has eliminated this work, which is an expensive maintenance operation. During the biennium a number of minor floods occurred, and some sections of highway were inundated. Nevertheless, no appre - ciable damage was caused. This condition is common in the State during periods of normal rainfall. A major flood occurred on May 11, 1942 j when Salt creek, in the vicinity of Lincoln, flooded surrounding areas, with the water reaching an all-time high. Water ran over Stat&lt;&gt; highways in this vicinity, necessitating the closing of several State Shop and Material Yaid at Lincoln During Salt Craak Hood, Mar 11. 1942 main highways for from ten to twelve hours. However, no pavement or bridges were washed out or other major damage done to the high - ways, and the only repairs required were the building up of eroded, earth shoulders. Considerable damage, estimated at 50,000 dollars, was caused to the State shop and material yard located at Sixth and South streets in Lincoln. The flood water from Salt creek was from four to five feet deep over the entire shop and yard. About fifty trucks and cars were located in the yard at this time and were practically covered with muddy water, causing much damage to this equipment. It was necessary to take the cars and trucks completely apart, clean, and overhaul them. Numerous electric motors and power units in the shop required complete cleaning and overhauling. Many parts in the supply base were made useless, and others required complete cleaning and oiling. A large portion of the records and files was destroyed. </seg>

Due to diversified weather conditions—parti - cularly with respect to temperature variations—the snow to be handled ranges from light, fluffy snow to packed, frozen and wet snow. For the most part the country is open and a snow storm rarely occurs without being accompanied by rather strong wind, which causes even light snowfall to pile up into huge drifts on those sections of highways which are subject to drifting. As an aid in combatting the drifting of snow, wood slat-type snow fence is used effectively. Each year approximately 850 miles of snow fence is erected in the fall and removed and stored the following spring. However, it is impossible to adequately protect the entire </seg>

         <seg id="p196">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER bad snow problems rarely cover the entire State at one time and generally occur in a confined area. The extreme eastern section of the State receives an annual rainfall of approximately thirty inches. This gradually diminishes as you cross the State to the west where the average annual rainfall is approximately fifteen inches. It is the policy of the Department to keep equipment operating on the highway during a snow storm, and while this plan aggravates the condition and in the end creates a more serious problem of snow removal after the storm has abated, due to highways being used continuously regardless of weather conditions, it is essential in order to keep the roads open during the storm. At this time it appears as though we will be unable to carry out this policy the coming winter Widening Roadway Through Drill with Rotary Snowplow due to our inability to obtain operators for snow removal equipment as a result of the labor shortage created by the war. While it is impossible to provide enough snow-fighting equipment to handle un - usual snow conditions as rapidly as desired, a few additional units are obtained each year so that facilities available for snow removal are gradually improved. The cost of snow removal varies considerably from year to year as shown below: Winter of Expenditure 1935-1936 $269,635 1936-1937 184,100 1939-1940 205,154 1940-1941 137,756 1941-1942 205,413 A minimum expenditure of 12,700 dollars was made during the winter of 1933-1934.

ROAD MAGNETS There is no doubt that the use of road magnets operated over other than hard-surfaced highways in order to pick up metallic sub - stances which would puncture a tire, has a material effect in pre - venting accidents. Therefore, two of these units have been used during '•'.•'¦" 'iiT-''i-\s-'- t..i^-i'.'&lt;s -Svi-V-,- '''¦¦- '»*.'..'-&gt;•-• - s-*:-'.¦'¦;'•¦ ''¦'}¦¦~'~" "v.;¦'""¦ ~'1:r/.','^ '^¦t":'!:''&gt; r'%^&gt;S^'tw^i^PF:^-v^ Asphalt Storage Plant at Broken Bow the past two years, and we have been able to cover the entire system at least once during their effective season. The two machines were made in our Lincoln shop and consist of a motor and generator mount - ed on a two-ton truck. The generator produces the electric current for magnetizing the magnet suspended from the truck chassis The trucks are equipped with sleeping quarters for the operator who leaves the Lincoln headquarters early in the spring. He follows a designated route and rarely returns until fall. The equipment can - not be operated effectively in the winter when the ground is frozen. During the year of 1941 the machines covered a total of 5,365 miles picking up 31,914 pounds or 15.6 tons of metal, an average of 5 9485 pounds per mile. The heaviest pickup was made from Valentine north to the State line on Highway No. 83, where 208 pounds of metal were picked up in a distance of 11 miles for an average of 18 9 pounds per mile. Up to October 1, 1942, the two magnets had covered a total of 3,235 miles with a total pickup of 19,650 pounds or 9.8 tons of metal which is an average pickup of 6.0741 pounds per mile.

HIGHWAY SIGNS The maintenance of signs and markers is one of the most im - portant activities of the Maintenance Department, and it is necessary to have a standard plan with respect to their placement. In order to have all employees properly instructed on a uniform system, a sign manual is furnished to all those responsible for sign maintenance. The coming of war industries and army cantonments into the State, and the changing traffic pattern as to volume and speeds, has created many new problems in the requirements and placement of highway signs. These problems have been handled, in the main, by the traffic engineering section and an account of this activity will be found under that heading. The statutes of this State provide that the Department shall purchase all new standard metal signs from the State Board of Control, which has supervision over all State institutions. All signs purchased in this manner were manufactured by the State Reformatory for Men, near Lincoln. Due to a shortage of steel, because of the war program, these signs cannot be manufactured, and since the first of the year of 1941, the Department has been forced to improvise and utilize the sign material on hand to meet its sign requirements. Special signs, both metal and wood, are made at the Department's sign shop which is one of the units of the equipment shop in Lincoln. This same shop also refinishes all signs which are suitable for further use. During the biennium 53,866 signs were refinished and 1,120 new signs were made. A large number of the new special signs were prepared for high - way use adjacent to our war activities. Many of these signs were beaded for reflectorization. This method has been found to be efficient and more economical than other means of reflectorizing. SEEDING SHOULDERS In Nebraska an effort is made to obtain a growth of vegetation on all shoulders. Considerable seeding of shoulders on hard-surfaced highways is undertaken each year. Where seeding or sodding is not undertaken j successfully, native vegetation is permitted to grow. Seeding is done both in early spring and early fall and in some cases the entire right of way out to the top of the back slopes is seeded. Brome grass generally is planted at the rate of 20 pounds per acre with a nurse crop of oats. Good results have been obtained in a number of cases. It is I felt that Brome grass provides an excellent sod and has • ample root growth to materially assist in preventing erosion. During the biennium, approximately 50,000 pounds of Brome grass seed were harvested from selected areas on the right of way where </seg>
         <seg id="p200">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER good stands prevailed. The seed is used the following fall or spring for new or reseeding.

         <seg id="p205">Reports of the District Engineers In the performance of Department activities in the field, the State is divided into eight districts, with headquarters at Lincoln, Norfolk, Grand Island, Bridgeport, McCook, North Platte, and Ainsworth. Headquarters for Districts 1 and 2 are located in Lincoln. Pig. 37 is a map of the State showing the eight districts. A district engineer has been placed in charge of the work in each of these areas and acts as a local representative of the Department in dealing with contractors, counties and municipal officials, and the public in general. The district engineers are responsible to the division heads and co-ordinate the work of surveys, construction, and maintenance within the districts. Following is a brief account of the activities in each of the districts during the biennium. DISTRICT NO. 1 District No. 1 is located in southeastern Nebraska and consists of the following named counties: Lancaster, Cass, Otoe, Nemaha, Gage, Saline, Fillmore, Thayer, Jefferson, Pawnee, Richardson, and John - son. The district headquarters is located in the State Capitol at Lincoln. A general summary of conditions for the years 1941 and 1942 shows that both years were periods of ample rainfall and numerous devastating floods which affected all parts of the district. The year 1942 brought many changes in personnel and methods of construction and maintenance as a result of labor and material shortages created by war conditions. During the biennium many improvements were made in the district and construction was begun on several new projects as a contribution to the war effort. Among such projects were the two access roads connecting the United States Aviation Technical Training Center with Highways No. 6 and No. 34 near Lincoln. The completion of several projects was delayed by lack of materials and labor, and one near Falls City was not completed be - cause steel girders could not be obtained for a bridge. Several of the projects included in the 1939-40 Biennial Report were actually not completed until 1942 because of weather, labor and material con - ditions. Tire rationing has greatly reduced traffic in general through - out this district, but in places near defense projects traffic has greatly 193 </seg>
         <seg id="p206">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER increased. Two satellite air fields are under construction, one near Bruning and one near Fairmont. Following is a detailed list of improvements on the highways of this district: Highway No. 2. In 1942 the stabilized base was removed from the section between Syracuse and Dunbar and a new foundation was constructed, using crushed rock in places and concrete in others. A bituminous mat will probably be placed on the foundation in 1943. Highway No. 3. Between Beatrice and the junction of Highways No. 3 and No. 4 east of Beatrice a rock base and armor coat was built. Between Fairbury and Beatrice a concrete and rock base was con - structed in a number of cuts where soil conditions were unstable. A bituminous mat will be placed on such sections. Between Hebron and Gilead a relocation was made and this section was graded, drained and graveled. Between Hebron and Nora contracts were awarded for grading, structures, and gravel partly on a new location, however, a portion of this work remains incomplete at this time because contrac - tors have been required to leave equipment on defense projects. Highway No. 4. Between Humboldt and Pawnee City a reloca - tion was made on Highway No. 4 between Table Rock and Pawnee City. This road was constructed, using a crushed rock foundation, tar stabilized base and armor coat, making an all-weather road. Highway No. 6. A contract was awarded in September, 1942 for the reconstruction and widening of West "O" Street between Lincoln and Emerald. This work consists of building a four-lane concrete - surfaced highway for a distance of approximately three miles west of Lincoln and a two-lane highway from that point to Emerald with widened sections in Emerald. Highway No. 33. The relocation of this highway south of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy tracks between Crete and the viaduct east of Friend was graded, drained, and graveled in 1941. In 1942 the section was surface treated with oil, making an all-weather road. Highway No. 67. A bridge over the Little Nemaha River one mile north of Talmage was washed out by floods in the spring of 1942, and a larger structure was built to replace it. Highway No. 77. In 1941 the stabilized base and armor coat was compktsd between Beatrice and tha Kansas-State line, making this highway an all-paved road through District No. 1. Highway No. 81. During the biennium, this highway was greatly improved by the construction of a viaduct to carry its traffic over Highway No. 6 and the main line of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy railroad, and by the construction of concrete pavement near </seg>

In addition to this work, bituminous pave - m?!vWa™T!trUCted t0 CloSe ¦" gaps on this route between Fairmont and the Nebraska-Kansas State line. The following feeder roads and miscellaneous projects were constructed: • Fairbury East. This road was graded, drained, and surfaced with biijumnous pavement from Highway No. 15 east approximately one «.' v"^ C!l7 WMt&lt; road was graded and Pravekd, and part of the bridges were built during the biennium.

The construction consisted of grading, drainage structures, gravel, and a new viaduct over the Missouri Pacific Railroad tracks. Geneva-Indußtrial School. This road, which connects a State institution with Highways No. 41 and No. 81, was graded, drained and surfaced with bituminous pavement in 1941. . a™"*, Access roads to United States Aviation Technical Training Center nsar Lincoln. Near Woodlawn a short access road was built con - necting Highway No. 2 and No. 34 with the northeast entrance to the training center. From a point about two and one-half miles west of Lincoln concrete pavement was laid to connect Highway No. 6 with the south entrance to the training center. Maintenance. Maintenance problems were greatly increased dur- a nnlUm °n account of devastating floods during 1941 and 1942 Approaches to numerous small bridges were washed out and one large structure was destroyed. Several bridges over the larger streams were extended to fit conditions created by excess erosion of tne banks. During the winters, snowfall was not excessive except in one or two storms, and roads were rarely closed to traffic for any length of time. Ther^ was very little damage to highways as a result of spring thaws, and traffic was not delayed seriously at any time. The problem of obtaining satisfactory labor for construction and maintenance opera - tions is becoming greater each day. DISTRICT NO. 2 Washington, Podge, Colfax, Platte, Polk, Butler, Saunders, Doug - las, Sarpy, Seward, York and parts of Merrick, Nance, Lancaster Cuming, Burt, Boone and Fillmore Counties make up District No 2 The district headquarters is located in the State House at Lincoln" </seg>
         <seg id="p208">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER Within the district there are 1,111 miles of State Highways, 469 miles of which are hard-surfaced and 642 miles are graveled. The biennium of 1941 and 1942 did not present any unusual main - tenance difficulties. There was some trouble during the spring of 1942 with "frost boils". During the summer of 1942, heavy rains in the vicinity of Blair washed out Highway No. 91 in two places and a record flood in Shell Creek and Beaver Creek basins in the northwest corner of the district caused some damage and considerable incon - venience to traffic. Snow removal during the biennium was not un - usually difficult and for the most part no roads were blocked for any period of time. Due to the national emergency, construction during the past bi - ennium has been principally done on roads in the vicinity of military reservations, munition manufacturing sites and on the national strate - gic highway network. Principal among these projects was the improve - ment of Highway No. 73 and 75 from the south city limits of Omaha to Fort Crook, site of the Glenn L. Martin bomber plant. This work consisted of the construction of two separated 22 foot traffic lanes with a highway grade separation immediately south of Omaha and a railroad grade separation near Fort Crook. Also included in this pro - ject was an access road leading from Highway No. 73 and 75 to the west entrance of the Glenn L. Martin plant and an access road begin - ning on Highway No. 73 and 75 at Avery and leading to the east entrance of the Martin plant near Bellevue. Another project brought on by the war was the widening of Highway No. 92 from the Platte River bridge east for a distance of approximately 4 miles. This was made necessary by the extremely heavy traffic between fomaha and the Nebraska Ordnance Plant near Mead. The work involWi widen - ing the concrete pavement, building four new structures and stabilizing the earth shoulders. A project of considerable interest was the re - grading and paving of Highway No. 2 between Seward and Lincoln. It was anticipated that the hard surfacing of Highway No. 81 across the district would be completed this biennium. This road has been relocated between Fairmont and York and between Columbus and Madison. The grading and drainage structures have been completed. Due to war conditions, material and labor could not be secured to com - plete the surfacing at this time even though the highway is on the strategic network. Other projects of interest which were completed during the past two years are; reconstruction of Highway No. 15 between David City and Schuyler with improved alignment and drainage; general improvement of Highway No. 6 between Gretna and Ashland where shoulders were widened, drainage improved and trees and shrubs planted. Three grade separation projects in addition to the two between Omaha and Fort Crook have been completed. One carries Highway No. 31 over the main line of the Union Pacific railroad at Elkhorn. This, together with the paving of Highway No. 31 between Elkhorn </seg>
         <seg id="p209">BUREAU OF HIGHWAYS and Dodge street, was completed and opened to traffic early in 1942. Another is over the Chicago and North Western railroad on Highway No. 38 west of Ak-Sar-Ben Field, Omaha. This eliminates a dangerous crossing and a bad reverse turn on this highway. The subway under the Chicago and North Western on Highway No. 73 at^pih and Grand Avenue in Omaha was rebuilt to provide a wider roadway and greater vertical clearance. : The contraction of several defense projects in the district has brought about a number of changes in the highway system. Expansion of the Fort Crook military reservation has made it necessary to relo - cate Highway No. 31. Inclusion of part of Highway No. 63 between Ithaca and Memphis in the Nebraska Ordnance Plant reservation has required the relocation of this highway. It is probable, however, that these relocations will not be constructed until after the termination of the war. Due to inability to get small projects done by contract, we have undertaken considerable construction by direct labor. This work in - cluded such jobs as construction of two large unreinforced concrete arch culverts on Highway No. 91 west of Blair; paving over "frost boils" between Kennard and Arlington on Highway No. 30; construc - tion of a brick maintenance shop at Bellevue, etc. DISTRICT NO. 3 This district comprises the following thirteen counties in the north - east corner of the State: Dakota, Dixon, Cedar, Knox, Antelope, Pierce, Wayne, Thurston, Burt, Cuming, Stanton, Madison, and Boone. There are approximately 1,338 miles of State highways in this district to service this section of the State, of which 478 miles are hard surfaced, S5l miles surfaced with gravel and 9 miles of municipal pavement. The headquarters for this district is located at Norfolk, and there are two resident engineers who assist the district engineer in supervis - ing the construction and maintenance of the highway in this district. Their headquarters are at Laurel and Neligh. Construction has been curtailed during 1942 by reason of the war program, which has made it practically impossible to obtain materials and contractors to do the work. However, during 1941 a considerable amount of construction work was completed, and this work was of great benefit because it mcreased our paved surfaces by approximately thirty miles. These projects are listed in detail below: On Highway No. 81 from Madison south including a connecting spur into Humphrey; on Highway No. 13 from the junction of Highways No. 81arid 13 north of Norfolk through Hadar to Pierce; on Highway No. 15 from Coleridge south and east to the junction of Highways No. 15 and No. 20 north of Laurel; and also the connection from Norfolk to the Norfolk State Hospital located northeast of Norfolk. Construction work including </seg>

The work programmed as construction work for 1942 was not con - tracted due to the inability of contractors to handle any more work than that which they had assumed under the war program, so it was decided to do as much reconstruction work as possible by renting equipment and handling the work on a direct labor basis. The work performed in this manner was concentrated on Highway No. 20 from Laurel west to Osmond, and Highway No. 15 from Wayne south to the junction with Highway No. 275 east of Pilger, and on Highway No. 275 from Oakdale to Clearwater. The work accomplished on this basis &amp;&amp;&amp;££ ¦ ¦ ¦ - - ¦ ¦ (IBnl ¦hSjl'-J Snowdrift after Being Opened to Two-way Traffic on these highways was the reconstruction of the subgrade and base for the bituminous surfacing, and only those sections which indicated failure during the spring were included in the work. Several miles of armor coat were placed on a direct labor basis, to prevent excessive wear on bituminous surfaces on Highway No. 77 from Oakland north and on Highway No. 81 from Norfolk north. In 1941 the position of maintenance foreman was created to provide for closer supervision of the detailed maintenance, and maintenance reconstruction operations on the State highway system. Each'resident engineer has three of these foreman operating under his direction. The foremen are located at strategic points and oversee the maintenance operations in their individual areas, all of which contain an approxi - mately equal mileage of State highways. No unusual maintenance problems were encountered during this biennium, although heavy snows fell during the early part of 1941 and again during the early part of 1942. However, no high winds followed, and with normal protection from vegetation and snow fence all high - ways were open to traffic within twenty-four hours after the storms ceased. The precipitation in this section of the State has returned to </seg>
         <seg id="p211">BUREAU OF HIGHWAYS normal during this biennium, and although it has been necessary to resurface most of the graveled highways, the work has been carried on without any serious inconvenience to traffic. A number of our regular maintenance employees as well as ex - perienced equipment operators have entered the armed forces or defense industries, and this has caused the routine work to be slow in starting and has delayed the completion in all our field operations for 1942. An increase in the cost of maintenance is caused by this emergency, as labor rates and prices of materials have increased due to the shortages created by this condition. DISTRICT NO. 4 District No. 4 is located in the south central part of Nebraska and includes Adams, Clay, Greeley, Hall, Hamilton, Howard, Merrick Nance, Nuckolls, Sherman, Valley, and Webster counties, with an area of approximately 6,551 square miles. Approximately 1,100 miles of State highways, built with State and Federal funds, are maintained within this district. The headquarters is at Grand Island and subdi - visions are at Grand Island, Hastings, Ord, Central City, and Superior. The district office has general supervision over all new construction within the limits of the district. The greater part of this work is performed by contract, although some is done by direct labor. Construction carried on during the biennium consisted chief - ly of 32 miles of grading, 19.4 miles of gravel surfacing, 27.2 miles of compacted gravel base course, 21 miles of armor coat, and 1.4 miles of bituminous mat surfacing. The various locations in the District are as described below: Ten and one half miles of reconstruction on Highway No. 3 west of Red Cloud included culverts, bridges, grading, and three-inch compacted gravel base course, and for the present, the compacted base is being used for the surface course. Four and eight tenths miles of relocation on Highway No. 14 south of Superior consists of grading, compacted gravel base course, and three large overflow bridges on the Republican river. This relo - cation eliminated approximately two miles of low road which was frequently flooded, and has caused much delay to traffic during wet weather in that vicinity. Six miles of relocation on Highway No. 3 between Nelson and Ruskin consists of grading, culverts, and four-inch compacted gravel base course, which is being used for the present surfacing. Seven miles of grading have also been started on Highway No. 3 east from this relocation through Ruskin. Fourteen and three tenths miles of reconstruction on Highway No. 11 between Ord and Burwell consists of grading, culverts/bridges, and four-inch compacted gravel base course.. In co-operation with Valley county and the Works Progress Administration, nine miles </seg>
         <seg id="p212">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER of grading, culverts, and gravel surfacing were completed on Highway No. 57 between Ord and Ericson, thus completing the connection between these two towns. Co-operating with Greeley county and the Works Progress Administration, four miles of grading, culverts, and gravel surfacing was completed on Highway No. 32 east of Spalding, thus completing the connection between Spalding and Albion. Approved plans were furnished Nance county for their use in co - operating with the Works Progress Administration to build 1.6 miles of grading and culverts as an extension of Highway No. 52 north of Belgrade, in anticipation of this road being graveled and maintained by the State. Three pavement dips on Highways No. 30 and No. 14 in Central City have been eliminated through the joint co-operation of this Department, Central City, and the Works Progress Administration. Three untreated wooden bridges have been replaced on Highway No. 281 south of Spalding with concrete arch culverts. One timber cattle pass on Highway No. 92 east of St. Paul has been replaced with a concrete arch culvert. Five and eight tenths miles of grading, culverts, and compacted gravel surfacing have been completed on Highway No. 14 north of Central City. This road had previously been difficult to maintain, due to ground water conditions. Eight miles of bituminous armor coat was placed on concrete pave - ment between Grand Island and Chapman on Highway No. 30. Approximately 13 miles of second bituminous armor coat was placed on the soil cement concrete base on Highway No. 14 north and south of Nelson. Approximately 0.8 of a mile of bituminous mat surfacing was placed on Highway No. 56 through Greeley, where, in co-operation with the Works Progress Administration, the Village of Greeley had installed curb and gutter and necessary drainage facilities. Approximately 0.6 of a mile of bituminous mat surfacing was placed on Highway No. 58 in Loup City, where the city, with help from the Works Progress Administration, had previously constructed curb and gutter and a storm sewer system to prepare the street for this surfacing. Five hundred twenty feet of concrete pavement was constructed about one mile north of Red Cloud, where, due to ground water conditions through a rock cut, it was found impossible to maintain a stabilized soil base course. Also, for similar reasons, 1,500 feet of concrete pavement was constructed south of Nelson on Highway No. 14, which is composed of two 400-foot sections and one 700-foot section. Approximately four miles of access road consisting of grading, three - inch compacted gravel base and bituminous armor coat was con- </seg>
         <seg id="p213">BUREAU OF HIGHWAYS structed north and east, of Alda to connect the Cornhusker Ord - nance Plant with Highway No. 30. Also approximately one-hall mile of bituminous sand surfacing was extended on Highway No. 2 west of Grand Island as another connection to the Cornhusker Ordnance Plant. Three and one-half miles of pavement widening on Highway No. 6 east of Hastings has been started to provide for increased traffic flow from Hastings to the Naval Ammunition Depot, now being constructed. This project consists of widening the grade, extending culverts, and an additional eleven foot lane of concrete pavement on the north side only, from the east city limits of Hastings to the main entrance of the Navy area. Also two miles of gravel surfacing was placed on county roads adjacent to the east edge of Hastings to provide secondary emergency connections for traffic in that vicinity, due to the Navy construction work. This con - struction was financed with Federal funds. Compared to the previous biennium, there has been considerable more rainfall, and maintenance costs have likewise been increased. The major maintenance problem has probably been the combating of repeated high water in the Republican river through Webster and Nuckolls counties, and mainly at the bridge south of Red Cloud and the bridge and overflow area south of Superior. In June, 1941, high water south of Red Cloud caused considerable erosion of the south bank and threatened to undermine the south fill approach of the highway bridge. However, this was prevented by retarding the flow near the bank with trees, brush, old car bodies, etc., and since that time permanent rock jetties have been installed, and the bank line has been re-established. During the same high water period consider - able damage was done near Superior where several acres of farm land were destroyed by the river changing its course just north and west of the highway bridge. Nevertheless, by the combined effort of this Department and other interested public utilities, it was possible to prevent the flood from destroying the north approach to the high - way bridge by placing trees, car bodies, and rocks to retard the Row of the water near the bank. The overflow area south of the river at this location caused the highway to be closed for several days, due to water over the road, arid when the water receded it left a consider - able amount of silt. To partly correct this situation, two brush-filled timber-jetties were constructed. A similar flood occurred twice during" 1942, but there was no further damage at Red Cloud, and the damage was not increased to any great extent south of Superior. There is still considerable bank protection work to be built south of Superior, for which plans are now being made. . Another major maintenance problem during this biennium has been the repairing of stabilized soil base; however, a system of making repair patches has been developed, whereby it will be possible to </seg>
         <seg id="p214">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER keep these roads in serviceable condition until they can be covered with a final wearing surface. Although there has been a gradual increase in mileage of hard surfacing over the district during the past several years, there is still a large percent of the highway system maintained as gravel roads, and during the past biennium a schedule has been set up whereby the shallow ditches and shoulder slopes are reshaped once every two years. In some instances where there is considerable erosion of the roadway and ditches, this is done every year by using a light blade and wheel tractor to pull in the shoulder slopes, thus accomplishing four things: 1. To salvage gravel that has been forced over the side by traffic and maintenance operations. 2. To restore the original width of the roadway, so that the entire surface may be covered with main - taining equipment. 3. To restore proper drainage for the surface and side ditches. 4. To facilitate snow removal in the winter time. Snow removal, as in the past, is a major maintenance problem. Since the last report we have received more efficient equipment which has been strategically located throughout the district to be most effective at the time of a storm, and during the past two years there have been no delays of more than a few hours to traffic, at any location. In the spring of 1941 the construction of a new patrol shed and maintenance yard was completed at Hastings with the assistance of the Works ProfTess Administration. The building is equipped with a shop for the field mechanic, office for the chief patrolman, additional office space for construction engineers, and equipment storage space. During 1942, with the co-operation of the Works Progress Ad - ministration, a three stall storage shed and equipment yard was built at Greeley. State forces built a two stall storage shed with small equipment yard at Aurora, and a three stall storage shed and equip - ment yard at Loup City. Together with the four buildings mentioned above and with other buildings constructed during previous bi - enniums, the district now is quite adequately equipped with permanent headquarters. In establishing these headquarters, consideration was given particularly to location with respect to major highway junc - tions, and in so doing it has been possible to consolidate smaller headquarters, thereby providing more efficient operation. Construction work during the last half of this biennium has been reduced to a minimum, due to the war emergency, and what con - struction we have done has been entirely essential to the war effort. This situation has also handicapped maintenance work to a serious extent in this district, due to two major war industries, namely the Cornhusker Ordnance Plant west of Grand Island, and the Naval Ammunition Depot east of Hastings. These two projects have required practically the entire output of gravel in this part of the State, and it has created a serious shortage of labor. Many of our experienced men have been drawn into this work, and it has not, in all instances, </seg>
         <seg id="p215">BUREAU OF HIGHWAYS been possible to replace them. Therefore, maintenance operations have necessarily been confined to the most serious conditions and to the most important routes. This has resulted, somewhat, in a general lowering of our maintenance standards. DISTRICT NO. 5 This district is composed of the eleven western counties which are commonly referred to as the Panhandle of Nebraska. The head - quarters is located in the City Hall at Bridgeport. During this biennium we have had above normal rainfall which resulted in good crops both in the dry-land and irrigated section over the entire district. The amount of construction work and maintenance work has been severely handicapped during 1942 due to the lack of labor. This shortage of labor was due primarily to the construction of ,two major defense projects; the Sioux Ordnance Plant at Sidney and the Alliance Air Support Glider Base at Alliance. There are a total of 1101 miles of State highways in this district, consisting of the following surface types: 644 miles of bituminous pavement 33 miles of concrete and asphalt pavement 361 miles of gravel surfaced road 63 miles of earth maintained roads Following is a summary of highway improvements completed dur - ing this biennium: Highway No. 19. Bituminous surfacing of 12 miles from a point 19 miles north of Alliance to the Niobrara river.. Reconstruction and bituminous surfacing of the 17 miles from the Nebraska-South Dakota State line to the junction with Highway No. 20, two miles west of Chadron. This completes the hard surfacing of Highway No. 19 from the Nebraska-Colorado State line, south of Sidney to the Nebraska-South Dakota line, northwest of Chadron. Highway No. 20. Bituminous surfacing was placed on the last graveled section of this road, consisting of eight miles from Harrison east. The completion of this surfacing marked the completion of hard surfacing on Highway No. 20 across the State. Highway No. 26. Reconstruction and bituminous surfacing from Lewellen to Oshkosh, from 6 miles west of Oshkosh to Lisco and from Broadwater to Bridgeport was completed during the construction sea - son of 1941. ' Highway No. 26N. Construction and bituminous surfacing of a new location from Northport to Broadwater, along the north side of the Union Pacific railroad were completed. </seg>
         <seg id="p216">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER Highway No. 138. An additional span was built on the bridge two miles northwest of Big Springs and a channel change was made, thus eliminating a flood hazard. The approach to this structure had been washed out several times previously during heavy rainy periods. Highway No. 27. The county and WPA have completed the grad - ing of an extension of this highway, south of Gordon for 4.8 miles and this section has been taken over for maintenance and surfaced with gravel by this department. This makes a total of 24 miles south of Gordon which are now under State maintenance as a graveled high - way. Grade crossing funds were used to make flashing-signal installa - tions at railroad crossings on the following highways: On Highway No. 19 at the Union Pacific crossing at Northport On Highway No. 20 at the Chicago North Western crossing west of Crawford On Highway No. 26 at the Union Pacific crossing at Broadwater On Highway No. 27 at the Chicago &amp; North Western crossing in Gordon On Highway No. 86 at the Union Pacific crossing in South Mitchell During 1942, we have constructed an access road to the Sioux Ordnance Plant. This access road consisted of two miles of grading, bituminous surfacing and a grade separation carrying Highway No. 30 over the Union Pacific tracks at Brownson. An access road to the Alliance Air Support Glider Base was also built. This construction consisted of one mile of grading and bituminous surfacing. DISTRICT NO. 6 This district, located in the southwest section of the State includes the following thirteen counties: Perkins, Chase, Dundy, Hitchcock, Hayes, Frontier, Red Willow, Furnas, Gosper, Phelps, Harlan, Franklin, and Kearney. District headquarters is maintained at McCook and headquarters for Resident Engineers and Chief Patrol - men are located at Imperial, McCook, Holdrege and Alma. Approximately 1100 miles of State highways are under mainten - ance in the district, of which 37 miles are surfaced with concrete pavement, 317 miles with bituminous mat, 730 miles with gravel, and the remaining 16 miles are earth roads. A considerable amount of construction was carried on in 1941, but highway construction activities were sharply curtailed in 1942 by conditions arising from war needs. In fact, the only projects in progress in 1942 were the completion of those which had been let to contract during 1941. These included the building of a large bridge with suitable approaches over the Republican river south of Arapahoe, regrading and modern structures on Highway No. 3 between Oxford </seg>
         <seg id="p217">BUREAU OF HIGHWAYS and Orleans and between Franklin and Riverton and regradine on Highway No. 183 north of Holdrege. g Especial emphasis has been placed on the installation of protection work along the Republican river to minimize the damage caused by periodic floods to which this area has been subjected. This work has consisted of the installation of pile and brush jetties or the extension of existing jetties at Franklin, Alma, Oxford, Arapahoe and Cam - bridge. Protection work to a lesser degree has also been placed on the Republican river south of Trenton and on the Arikaree river west of Haigler. The elimination of troublesome bends in the Republican at Alma, Oxford, Arapahoe and Trenton by the construction of new channels should in the future also tend to prevent destruction of the structures and fills. Maintenance conditions have been about normal during this biennium except that repeated and unusually heavy rains during the summer of 1941 caused a great deal of damage to the highways as well as other property in the southern tier of counties in the district Aggravated by a period of abnormally dry years, erosion was unusual - ly severe and silting of roadway ditches and drainage courses caused flooding of some areas which had never before been damaged. * A heavy downpour on the night of April 18, 1942, in the area drained by Coon creek and Dry creek caused the inundation of high - ways in those localities and also the major portion of the city of Indianola and part of Bartley. Damage to the highway was not very serious but traffic on the Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy railroad was interrupted for several days as a result of the grade being washed away and the residents of Indianola suffered a very heavy property damage. It was indeed fortunate that no lives were lost. The United States Army Engineers had previously made a detailed study of flood conditions arising in these areas as well as those areas drained by other tributaries to the Republican. Progress has been made in compiling data and completing plans for future flood control, and plans are being formulated for prosecution of this work under an agreement betweeh the Department of Roads and Irrigation, the Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy railroad, Red Willow county and other interested parties. The war situation has complicated the development of this matter to some extent, but it is hoped that the straightening of the channels and con - struction of necessary dykes may be completed before another major disaster is experienced. The flood in the Republican river following this rain washed out an approach to the overflow bridge south of Oxford and destroyed part of the piling at the river bridge south of Ahna. Traffic was delayed but a few hours at Oxford, but at Alma traffic was diverted to other routes while the broken piling were being replaced. On June 12, 1942, a deluge of approximately 9 inches caused a flood which destroyed two forty-foot spans of a bridge one mile west </seg>
         <seg id="p218">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER of Franklin on Highway No. 3 and did considerable damage to the adjacent roadway fills. This rain also inundated Highway No. 10, one mile south of Macon and it was necessary to detour traffic around this section for several weeks. The imperative need for gravel trucks on defense projects has caused a shortage of this type of equipment. Application of needed maintenance gravel has been delayed in some instances because of the inability of contractors to meet the increased demand for this material, and the difficulty of obtaining sufficient trucks for hauling. Increased rainfall during this biennium has been responsible for some delay to traffic and has caused an increased maintenance expendi - ture in order to keep the highways in satisfactory condition for traffic. However, the increased moisture has been very welcome as crop conditions have been the best that have prevailed in this district for many years. Improvements in the various counties are as follows: Chase County. Reconstruction of a section of Highway No. 6, at the junction of No. C and No. 61, should eliminate a hazardous condition which has existed after heavy rains in the past. The grade was raised approximately 3 feet and the bituminous pavement will be reconstructed. Dundy County. An additional course of gravel has been placed on Highway No. 61 north of Benkelman. Many expressions of appre - ciation have been received in regard to the roadside improvement project constructed east of Benkelman. Franklin County. Reconstruction of Highway No. 3 from Franklin to Riverton has given v greatly improved grade line and should be. of great assistance in keeping this route free from snow drifts which previously had caused considerable trouble. Construction of a feeder road north of Naponee including a modern bridge over Turkey creek will be of great value to residents of that section of the county. Frontier County. Concrete protection work was installed at the Medicine creek bridge east of Stockville. Considerable reshaping has been done by State forces on Highways No. 23S and No. 23N and also on Highway No. 83. Furnas County. Reconstruction of Highway No. 283 south of Arapahoe with more adequate structures was completed in 1942. Highway No. 89 from the junction of No. 89 and No. 283 east through Beaver City was also completed in 1942. Plans for surfacing these projects with bituminous pavement were necessarily delayed because of inability to obtain the required oil. Gospei County. Additional maintenance gravel has been added on most of the highways in this county. Considerable improvement </seg>
         <seg id="p219">BUREAU OF HIGHWAYS has been made by the regrading by State forces of sections which were low and had a tendency to hold snow and water. Hailan County. Reconstruction of Highway No. 3 from Oxford to Orleans was completed in 1942. Plans for a relocation south of Oxford including a new river bridge were delayed on account of the war. Considerable reshaping and ditch cleaning was accomplished by State forces on Highway No. 89. Hayei County. Gravel surfacing of Highway No. 17 between Hayes Center and Grainton was completed. Hitchcock County. Reconstruction of bituminous pavement on Highway No. 6 between Culbertson and Palisade was accomplished in 1942. In co-operation with the City of Stratton a roadside im - provement project was installed adjacent to the city park at Stratton. Kearney County. Bituminous surfacing was applied on Highway No. 44 between the junction with Highway No. 6, east of Axtell, and Kearney. The surfacing of this route is of especial value at this time because of increased traffic between defense projects at Kearney and at Hastings. Phelps County. Reconstruction of Highway No. 183 between Holdrege and the Platte river was completed in 1941. Additional gravel was placed on Highway No. 23 from Holdrege west to the county line. Perkins County. Additional gravel was placed on several sections of Highway No. 17, and considerable improvement was made by reshaping part of this route. Red Willow County. A section of Highway No. 6 east of Bartley was reconstructed in 1942. Highway No. 83 north of McCook was regraded and additional gravel was added both in 1941 and 1942 Considerable ditching was also required on this route in order to minimize the erosion of fill slopes. DISTRICT NO. 7 This district includes the following twelve counties located in the west central part of the State: Arthur, Grant, Hooker, Thomas, Blame, Custer, Logan, McPherson, Keith, Lincoln, Dawson, and Buffalo. The district headquarters is located at North Platte and headquarters for resident engineers or chief patrolmen are located at North Platte, Broken Bow, Kearney, and Ogallala. This district has an area of 13,209 square miles and a population of 106,920. Within this area is a network of approximately 1,110 miles of State highways of which 453 miles are surfaced with bituminous </seg>
         <seg id="p220">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER or concrete pavement, 585 miles are surfaced with gravel, and the remaining mileage consists of earth or sand trails. There has been a considerable loss in population in this district during the biennium due to the migration of laborers to the various defense industries. It has been necessary to defer many improvements and needed repairs because of the difficulty in obtaining sufficient labor, material, and equipment to carry on the work. This has been particularly noticeable in areas adjacent to defense plants. Many of the experienced maintenance employees have left the Department to accept work at other places, causing a large turnover in the main - tenance personnel. Maintenance operations during 1941 were of a routine nature Rainfall was below normal and numerous break-ups occurred in the graveled surfaces. It was necessary to haul water on the surfaces during the hot summer months to keep the highways in a safe condition. In the spring of 1941 a severe snow storm occurred in the eastern part of the district after the snow fence had been taken down to per - mit spring farming operations. This caused considerable drifting on the highways blocking nearly all roads in that vicinity. Snow fall during the fall of 1941 and spring of 1942 was about normal No unusual difficulty was experienced in keeping the roads open except for short periods during and immediately after the storms. Rainfall during 1942 was considerably above normal and it is reflected in the best crop conditions in years over the entire district Several rains of cloud-burst proportions fell in the south half of the district. The first in the western part of the district fell on April 18 when after three weeks of almost continuous rain a six-inch rain fell causing considerable damage to both public and private property During this time the South Platte river was at flood stage. The bottom land along the river was inundated and damage was done to the ap - proach fills to several of the Platte river bridges. A rain of unusual intensity fell on June 1 in the vicinity of Elm Creek and Kearney Several drainage structures were washed out south of Odessa and Elm Creek and much of the gravel was washed from the roadways Much of the bottom lands were inundated and the crops were des - troyed. The water was over the highways in many places and traffic was delayed, however, no serious damage resulted. Due to the war and defense activity the amount of construction during the biennium was considerably less than in recent years The work consisted chiefly of short projects to eliminate traffic hazards such as narrow obsolete bridges, poor alignment, and the widening of pavement through villages. The alignment change and new bridge on Highway No. 83 south of North Platte and the construction of a new bridge west of Arnold on Highway No. 92 are typical examples. Very little change was made in the mileage of surfaced highways A </seg>
         <seg id="p221">BUREAU OF HIGHWAYS number of farm to market roads were constructed on the secondary system in several counties. y A brief summary of the work during the biennium in the various counties of the district is as follows: v«»rious Buffalo County. Construction during the biennium consisted of grading, culverts, bridges, and bituminous surfacing on Highway No 183 from Elm Creek south to the Phelps county line. The construction of this project eliminated several narrow obsolete bridges and also eliminated a section of highway that was usually inundated afw each 1Y ?*£ Several bridges were replaced on Highway No. 183 north of Elm Creek using material salvaged from other locations within the district. Flashing light signals were installed at the inter - section of the Union Pacific railroad and Highway No. 30 in the east part of Kearney. Several sections of Highway No. 40, between Kearney and Sumner, were reshaped by maintenance forces. Head - quarters for the resident engineer and shops for the repair of main - tsnanco equipment are located at Kearney. Custer County. A new bridge and approaches were built over the South Loup river on Highway No. 92 west of Arnold. This new bridge replaced a fourteen-foot roadway structure which has during the.past years been the scene of many accidents. Twenty-five miles of road on Highway No. 92, between Merna and Arnold, and west of Arnold were reshaped during the summer. This work was performed by maintenance employees using maintenance equipment New con - crete drainage structures were built and alignment and grade revised on Highway No. 80 between Merna and Victoria Springs State Park The untreated timber structures which were not only inadequate but unsafe for further use were replaced, Maintenance operations in this county were routine during the summer. Additional right of way was obtained adjacent to the Broken Bow patrol yard to accomodate the storage of material and equipment. Headquarters for the resident engineer and a shop for the maintenance of equipment used in Custer county and several adjacent counties are located at Broken Bow. Arthur^ McPhewon. and Logan Counties. In 1941 a farm to mar - ket road was built north of Stapleton in Logan county for a distance of six miles, providing a surfaced road into the ranch section of the county. This road wiU be a part of the North Platte-Valentine high - way when it is entirely completed across the sand hills. Four and one - half miles on Highway No. 40, between Stapleton and Tryon were graded, clayed, and graveled, to provide a gravel road toward the west part of the county. There was no new construction in Arthur or McPhersoii counties during the biennium. Dawson. Work in this county during the biennium was of a routine nature. Highway No. 47 from Gothenburg to Farriam was </seg>
         <seg id="p222">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER reshaped during 1942. Considerable reshaping of Highway No. 21, north of Lexington, and Highway No. 40, from Miller to Oconto, was completed during the year. After the high water in the Platte river in April, 1942, it was found necessary to construct additional protection on the approach fill to the river bridge on Highway No. 21, south of Lexington. This work consisted of the construction of additional jetties and willow mat protection. Automatic railroad grade crossing devices were installed at the intersection of the highways with the main line of the Union Pacific railroad in Lexington and Cozad. Keilh County. In co-operation with Keith county, a secondary road was built from Keystone west to connect with Highway No. 61 at the north end of the Kingsley dam. The abandoned Union Pacific railroad grade was widened and the drainage structure replaced. The twenty-foot pavement through the Village of Paxton was widened to forty-two feet and the drainage system revised and improved. Considerable reconstruction was performed on Highway No. 26 be - tween Ogallala and Lewellen. Several sections of the bituminous mat between Paxton and Big Springs were taken up and reconstructed. A shop for the maintenance and repair of equipment and headquarters for the resident engineer are located at Ogallala. Lincoln County. Construction in this county during the biennium consisted of widening the pavement on Highway No. 30 through the Village of Sutherland. One of the worst traffic hazards on Highway No. 83 between North Platte and McCook was eliminated by a relo - cation and the construction of a new bridge. About seventy-five per cent of the material used on this project was salvaged from other projects in the State. Bituminous curbs and slope drains were built on the section of the bituminous mat on Highway No. 92 where surface run-off continued to erode the shoulder slopes. A bituminous armor coat was placed on older sections of the concrete pavement in the vicinity of North Platte to prevent deterioration of the surface. A considerable proportion of the gravel roads in this county was re - shaped during the biennium. The district shop for the overhaul and reconstruction of maintenance equipment is located at North Platte. Granl, Hooker, Thomas, and Blame Counties. In co-operation with Blame county approximately three miles of secondary road were built on Highway No. 7 north of Brewster. This work consisted of drainage structures, grading, and clay and gravel surfacing. With the exception of approximately one and one-half miles north of Brewster, this completes the highway to the Brown County line. A section of Highway No. 2 in Hooker and Thomas counties was reshaped and a new drainage structure was installed during the biennium. Right of way for patrol yards to store material and equipment were acquired at Dunning, Thedf ord, and Mullen. A new patrol shed was constructed at Mullen during 1942. </seg>
         <seg id="p223">BUREAU OF HIGHWAYS DISTRICT NO. 8 This district is composed of the following nine counties located in the north-central part of the State: Boyd, Brown, Cherry, Garfleld, Holt, Keya Paha, Loup, Rock, and Wheeler. The headquarters for this district is located at Ainsworth. Maintenance patrol headquarters are located at Valentine, Ainsworth, O'Neill, and Burwell. The principal east and west highway is No. 20 which extends across the district for a distance of 217 miles. This highway carries a heavy truck traffic moving cattle from the sand hills in Cherry county to the Omaha and Sioux City markets. Large quantities of hay are also transported over this route to the eastern and western parts of the State from the extensive hay flats in the vicinity of New - port and Atkinson. Tourist traffic to the Black Hills and Yellowstone Park increased noticeably over this route during 1941 due to the com - pletion of the hard surfacing on this route across the entire State during 1940. Important north and south highways are No. 281 from Bartlett to O'Neill and to the South Dakota State line; No. 11 from Burwell to Atkinson and Butte; and No. 183 from Taylor to Bassett and Spring - view. The precipitation during the past two years has been above / average, and as a result the crops and range conditions have been excellent over the entire district. Snow-removal costs were increased in 1942 over previous years due to the heavy snowfall and several severe blizzards. Heavy, wet snows and abnormal spring rainfall caused considerable damage to bituminous surfaced highways, and extensive repair and reconstruction was necessary during the past year. The abnormal spring rains in 1942 resulted in flood conditions on all streams in the district, with the loss of several bridges and approach fills. The south abutment of the Ponca creek bridge and a large portion of the approach fill on Highway No. 281 north of Butte was washed out on May 7, 1942. The north abutment of the Niobrara river bridge at Meadville on Highway No. 7 was washed out on May 15,1942, and a small overflow bridge and both approach fills on High - way No. 183 at Riverview were washed out on the same date. On May 12, 1942, high water caused considerable damage to the south approach fill of the North Loup river bridge on Highway No. 11 at Burwell. Flood conditions on other streams in the district created numerous problems but damage to highway grades and structures was light. Construction activity in the district has been considerably restric - ted during the past biennium due to the present National Emergency, the scarcity of critical raw materials, labor and equipment. Construc - tion operations have been confined primarily to reconstruction of bituminous paved highways which have proven inadequate, and the extension of some of the secondary roads. </seg>
         <seg id="p224">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER Boyd County. This county, lying between the Niobrara and Missouri rivers, is principally an agricultural region. Abundant crops and higher market prices have greatly improved the financial condi - tions in the county. No construction work was carried on in the county during the biennium. Highway No. 12 was regraded by maintenance forces from Bristow east, improving the grade lines and repairing the damage caused by flood waters from Ponca creek. Other activities were confined to routine maintenance operations. Brown County. Construction work in this county has been con - fined primarily to secondary highways. Highway No. 7 between Ainsworth and Brewster has been extended 5.4 miles, and Highway No. 55 south of Long Pine has been extended 5 miles by the Depart - ment in conjunction with Brown county and WPA forces. These two highways are important feeder roads providing an outlet for southern Brown county to Highway No. 20. Highway No. 7 north of Ainsworth has been completely regraded by State maintenance forces. Guard rail was installed on the heavy fills between Ainsworth and Long Pine. Cherry County. This county, the largest in the State, having an area of 5,979 miles, is the heart of the sand-hill section of Nebraska. This county is commonly referred to as "The Home of a Million Cattle," and its major industry is cattle raising, which provides one of the important food commodities needed by the nation and our armed forces at home and abroad. Highway No. 20 extending the full length of the county from east to west provides the only route for truck traffic transporting the cattle to market. Construction in this county has been confined to Highway No. 83. The bituminous pavement south of Valentine was extended for a distance of 10.25 miles providing 20.5 miles of hard surfaced highway south from Highway No. 20. A gravel surfaced road was constructed from the Thomas-Cherry county line north for a distance of 4.5 miles, extending the improved highway north from Thedford. This leaves only 25.5 miles of sand-hill trail on Highway No. 83 between Highways No. 2 and No. 20. Highway No. 83 from Valentine north to the South Dakota State line was regraded by State maintenance forces. Clay surfacing was replaced by maintenance forces on Highway No. 61 from Merriman north to the South Dakota State line. Guard rail was in - stalled on Highway No. 20 between Nenzel and Merriman, and on Highway No. 83 south of Valentine. Garfield, Loup, and Wheeler Counties. Crop conditions in these counties have been very satisfactory. Truck farming under irrigation has resulted in the establishment of a canning factory at Burwell which is now in its second year of operation. Construction in this territory consisted of the improvement of Highway No. 11 between Burwell and Ord. Concrete ditch lining and </seg>

Other activities were confined to routine maintenance operations. Holt County. A feeder road project extended the secondary highway norfh to Stuart a distance of 3 miles. A gap of 4.3 miles on Highway No. 11 between Atkinson and Butte was surfaced with gravel to provide an all-weather road between these communities. The feeder road south of Lynch was improved and extended 7 miles by the Department in conjunction with Holt county and WPA forces Reconstruction by State forces of bituminous surfacing which has proven inadequate under heavy traffic, has been undertaken during the biennium on Highways No. 20 and 275. Hock and Keva Paha Counties. Highway No. 183 has been regraded and improved by State maintenance forces at several loca - tions in these counties.

         <seg id="p227">Motor Vehicle Division MOTOR VEHICLE REGISTRATION The registration of motor vehicles was first required in this State by H.R. 146 of the 1905 Session Laws. This act required that all automobiles in the State be registered with the Secretary of State, and the fee was fixed at one dollar which was to be disposed of as other fees collected by that office. In each of the subsequent sessions, the Legislature amended the Motor Vehicle Act. Following are the most important changes: 1) The registration was required to be made annually. 2) The different classes of motor vehicles that were beginning to appear on the highways were required to be registered. 3) A schedule was established to fix the fee according to type and size of vehicle. 4) The fees were collected by the county treasurer. 5) The fees were increased to provide revenue not only to defray the costs of administering the act but also to provide for road maintenance and improvement. In 1919 the Legislature through the Civil Administrative Code Bill provided for the creation of the Department of Public Works— the predecessor of the Department of Roads and Irrigation. At that time the function of administering the Motor Vehicle Act was trans - ferred from the office of the Secretary of State to the newly created Motor Vehicle Division which was made responsible to the State Engineer and this Division has remained an adjunct Division of the Department since that time.

         <seg id="p233">MOTOR VEHICLE DIVISION All motor vehicle registrations in the State of Nebraska are now made in the office of the county treasurer of the county in which the applicant actually resides or conducts a bona fide business. Five cents of each original registration fee is retained by the county treasurer's office to cover the cost of issuing the license. Two and one-half per - cent of the balance is forwarded to this Department for use in con - nection with other funds to defray the operating costs of the Motor Vehicle Division and to pay for the cost of manufacturing the license plates. Of the remainder, thirty percent is forwarded to this Depart - ment for use in connection with other funds to maintain the State highway system. Severity percent is placed in the county highway fund by the county treasurer for use by the county. The county treasurer forwards a copy "of each motor vehicle registration to the Motor Vehicle Division where a file of registration is maintained in license number order and motor number order. Prior to 1940 an alphabetical file in the name of the registered owner was maintained but was discontinued for the years 1940, 1941, and 1942. However, it has been deemed advisable to again maintain this alpha - betic record starting with the year 1943. Previous to 1938 the county treasurer, when making a new regis - tration, wasrequired to- use a form of certmcate ivhich could be separated into three sections in this office in order that a record would be filed in the motor, number, license number and alphabetical files, respectively. In 1938 this yrork was performed on the tabulating machines. This materially reduces the work in the county treasurer's office since it is only necessary to enter the required information once on the registration certificate. When the certificate is received in this office, the information is punched on a tabulating card and the certificatesarefiled numerically iri license number order. The tabulat - ing cards are then mechanically sorted and listed by make of vehicle in motor number order. Besides reducing the work in the county treasurer's office this procedure makes it possible to answer requests for information in this office within a shorter time. OPERATOR'S LICENSES The Motor Vehicle Operator's License Act was amended by the Legislature in 1937 ;tp provide for a more rigid examination of the applicants for operators' licenses. The law requires that every appli - cant for an original license must appear personally before an examin - ing officer and satisfy the examiner that he possesses, with or without the aid of spectacles, sufficient powers of eye sight, and that he is physically fit and has sufficient knowledge of the motor vehicle laws to enable him to operate a motor vehicle with a reasonable degree of safety. These licenses are issued by the county treasurers, but the examinations are given by. members of the safety patrol, who have received special training for this]work. </seg>

Abstracts of court records of convictions for violations of motor vehicle laws, accident records, suspensions, revo - cations, written warnings and violation cards given by Nebraska safety patrolmen are recorded on the face of the envelope containing the individual's license record. In cities and States where a similar file has been maintained for a number of years, it has been found that only a small percentage of all operators are responsible for the majority of infractions of the motor vehicle laws and are involved in the majority of the accidents. These records are maintained in order to determine which drivers are a menace, and through existing statu - tory means, take the necessary steps to limit and restrict the operations of such persons. TITLE TO MOTOR VEHICLES Legislative Bill No. 221, known as the Certificate of Title Act, was enacted by the 1939 Legislature June 2,1939, and became effective September 8, 1939. The Certificate of Title Act provides that county clerks in each, of the 93 respective counties of the State of Nebraska shall issue certifi - cates of titles to motor vehicles in accordance with a uniform system prescribed by the Department of Roads and Irrigation. The Act provides that the Department of Roads and Irrigation shall furnish all forms which are required under Section 13 of this act except manufacturers' or importers' certificates. The Act further provides for a fee of fifty cents for each title issued. The Certificate of Title Act provides for the recording of liens and encumbrances on motor vehicles on the certificate of title and amends Section 36-208, 36-301, 36-302, and 36-303, Compiled Statutes 1929 and Section 33-209, Compiled Statutes Supplement, 1937 which prior to the time of the enactment of the Certificate of Title Act provided for the filing, deposit, or other record whatsoever of a chattel mortgage covering a motor vehicle in the county clerks office. The Act also prohibits the sale of motor vehicles unless accom - panied by a certificate of title or manufacturer's certificate with such assignments thereon as are necessary to show title in the name of the purchaser. A manufacturer's certificate is required to be furnished by the manufacturer on every new car delivered to Nebraska dealers for the purpose of display or resale. The manufacturer's certificate denotes the origin of the motor vehicle. The certificate of title provided for in the Act is furnished to the county clerks by the Department of Roads and Irrigation and is made </seg>

The original or first copy is retained by the owner, or Iienholder, the second and fourth copies are forwarded to the Department, the third and fifth copies are filed in the county clerk's office, and the sixth copy is presented to the county treasurer by the owner for the purpose of obtaining registration. The large copy sent to the Department is coded and filed alphabetically for the State at large. It is used for the purpose of showing the notation and cancel - lation of liens against the motor vehicle. The small copy forwarded to the Department is filed by motor number, by make of car, and is used to form the chain of title to the motor vehicle. Although the Certificate of Title law has now been in effect a trifle over three years, we believe it has proven its worth, as the motor vehicle owners realize that the certificate of title protects their property rights. With every motor vehicle sold, the dealer is furnished a manu - facturer's certificate by the manufacturer, describing the motor vehicle in detail and showing transfer of title to the motor vehicle from the manufacturer to the dealer by assignment of the manufacturer's certifi - cate which the dealer, in turn, assigns to the purchaser. The purchaser then has knowledge of the origin of the motor vehicle. In every case of transfer of used cars from the owner to the dealer, the owner is required to furnish the dealer a certificate of title. The certificate of title describes the motor vehicle in full, the owner's name and address, name of previous owner, and also shows existing liens, if any, against the motor vehicle. The licensed dealer is authorized to transfer the motor vehicle by reassignment of the certificate of title. The loan companies, or lienholders, are benefited because they are permitted under the Act to hold the certificates of title showing their lien noted thereon until the lien is satisfied, then the title is returned to the owner. The Iienholder is also aware of the fact that liens against motor vehicles made subsequent to September 8, 1939, effective date of the Title Act, are not in effect against the motor vehicle unless recorded on the certificate of title. From September 8,1939, to October 1,1942, the county clerks have issued the following number of certificates of titles, receipts for nota - tions of liens and receipts for cancellation of liens: Total number of original Certificates of Title, Form RV 700, issued and/or passing through the offices of the ninety-three county clerks: From September 8, 1939 to January 1, 1941 378,925 From January 1, 1941 to September 1, 1942 377,733 Grand Total from September 8, 1939 to September 1, 1942 756,658 Total Duplicate Certificate of Title Form RV 701 from September 8, 1939 to September 1, 1942 12,789 </seg>

Receipts for notation and cancellation of liens are carefully checked with the copies of the certificates of title for correctness in name and amount of liens. The title records have proven to be very beneficial to the general public and law enforcement officers when information regarding titles and liens against motor vehicles is needed. Under the provisions of the Certificate of Title Act, the title section of the Motor Vehicle Division maintains a stolen car file, which has been in operation since September, 1939, with an active file of approximately 17,500 cars at the present time and 32,700 re - coveries. Bulletins are issued weekly, giving the description of cars reported stolen and recovered during that period. A copy is mailed to motor vehicle administrators throughout .the country, as well as to county sheriffs, patrolmen, and police agencies in this State. The total number of items which have appeared on the bulletin is 1275, of which number 1204 have been reported recovered. A complete record is maintained of all cars reported by peace officers and individuals within the State, and losses from out of the State when reported by a peace officer. Each Nebraska item is check - ed with the registration record to verify license number, motor num - ber, and make of car. These items are published in the bulletin and a record is kept in the master file, which is maintained by make of car and motor number, and also indexed as to license number, and accord - ing to name of owner. </seg>

The titular head of the Department of Roads and Irrigation is designated as the Administrator of this act v- v * *ssisted m this Potion by an unsalaried advisory board which, at the present time, consists of five motor vehicle dealers who serve on this board to further the interests of the motor vehicle busi- II6SS. This act requires the licensing of motor vehicle dealers and motor vehicle salesmen and provides that such licenses, if issued shall be in effect to the first day of January next following the date of issuance thereof and shall then expire. However, upon the expiration of such license, the same may be renewed upon payment of the schedule of feesf specified to accompany applications, and such renewals may be made from year to year as a matter of right if the license of the applicant for renewal has not been revoked for just cause The act also provides for the revocation and suspension of licenses for certain classes of violations. An original action was filed in the .Nebraska Supreme Court seeking a declaratory judgement interpreting this law. Having heard f e?S C Neb£ aSka Supreme Court m opinion dated Decem - ber 20 1939, generally approved the validity of the Motor Vehicle Dealer s Licensing Law. They did, however, in this opinion eliminate several sections from the law as being, invalid. The sections declared by the court to be unconstitutional and void are subdivision (i) of Section 60-912, C. S Supp., 1937, and the limitation contained in sub - division (a) of Section 60-906, C. S.

         <seg id="p242">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER The total number of licenses issued to the three classes of licensees during the biennium is as follows: Jan. 1, 1941 Jan. 1,1942 to to Dec. 31,1941 Oct. 31,1942 New and used motor vehicle dealers 1031 838 Used motor vehicle dealers §48 g 4B Motor vehicle salesmen 3ggi 2703 Since January 1, 1941, 30 formal complaints were filed in affidavit form and after due notice, formal hearings were held upon these com - plaints before the Administrator and the Advisory Board. Following these hearings, nine licenses were revoked, four licenses were suspend - ed for different periods of time, eight applications for licenses were denied, and nine complaints were dismissed. The revocations and suspensions of licenses were based on misrepresentations of cars and fraudulent transactions. The applications denied were based on unfit - ness of the applicants. As the law provides such heavy penalties, and because the Administrator's Office is of the opinion that the licensee's wrong doings could otherwise be corrected, informal hearings are held before the Administrator and Advisory Board. At such hearings the licensee is apprised of the seriousness and consequence of whatever act he committed. From January 1, 1941 to October 31, 1942, thirty-four informal hearings have been held by the Board. To better assist the motor vehicle dealer and salesman, a revision was made in the "Official Nebraska Used Car Survey." The revised book contains two hundred ten pages. The contents consist of an active passenger automobile section, model specification section, truck section, summary of motor laws in the forty-eight States, and a manufacturer's directory. Included with identification data, characteristics, motor and serial number locations, factory advertised price and weights, are the "cash" and "retail" values on all active passenger cars and trucks up to one and one-half ton capacity. These values are obtained by conducting a survey. This survey is conducted by consulting experienced used car appraisal men located in the State. These appraisers meet as a committee and arrive at the values of used cars set out in this book. This book is issued every three months and is made available to all licensed dealers and salesmen.

         <seg id="p245">Law Enforcement and Public Safety In 1941, the Legislature established in the Department of Roads and Irrigation the Nebraska safety patrol, and provided that the chief officer should be the Superintendent of Law Enforcement and Public Safety, who may be known and designated as State Sheriff. LAW ENFORCEMENT In addition to his duties as chief officer of the safety patrol, the State Sheriff is responsible for the enforcement of laws relating to felonies, and for those activities pertaining to criminal investigation, criminal identification and radio communications. On October 15, 1941, as provided by a Legislative enactment of 1941, eleven safety patrolmen were appointed deputy State sheriffs with the authority to work on criminal cases when called upon by law enforcement officers of Nebraska or upon order of the State Sheriff. This work is performed in conjunction with their regular duties as highway patrolmen. Typical of the variety of investigations, reports and arrests made by the State Sheriff and his organization are the following extracts from the records of the State Sheriffs office : During the period from January 1, 1941 to September 30, 1942 there were three bank robberies and one attempted bank robbery, all of which were cleared by the arrest and conviction of the criminals. Two bank burglaries were also committed, but these cases are still unsolved. Twelve murders, one attempted murder, and three manslaughter cases wererepbrted. Seven murder cases were cleared by the appre - hension and conviction of the murderers, one case was changed to manslaughter and the defendant was sentenced to the penitentiary, two cases resulted in acquittals, and two cases are still pending. The attempted murder case is still unsolved. Two of the manslaughter cases wertcieared by sentencing the defendants to the penitentiary, and the defendant was acquitted in the trial of the third case. There were more than three hundred forgery and bad check cases reported. Many of the forged or no fund checks were passed by the same person or persons. Ninety-nine arrests were made, and of this number-twenty were sentenced to either the penitentiary or the re - formatory. Many of the no fund check cases were cleared by the payment of the amount of the checks, and other defendants were fined or sentenced to jaiL The law enforcement department issues a weekly bulletin which has a circulation of five hundred thirty-five.

The purpose of the bulletin is to disseminate information to law enforcement officers of Nebraska and surrounding States. The following is a brief summary of the work accomplished by the law enforcement department: Arrests 42g Sentenced to penal institutions 140 Fined 33 Turned over to out-of-state officers 35 Returned to penal institutions 49 Dismissed, paroled, pending, etc 170 In January, 1942, the Governor appointed the State Sheriff as Chief of the Police Mobilization Plan for the State of Nebraska. Under this plan law enforcement agencies will co-operate with the fire protection and aircraft warning services, all of which are spon - sored by the Nebraska Advisory Defense Committee. The plan will utilize all regular peace officers of the State. The State was divided into thirteen districts, and two captains - one a sheriff, the other a chief of police—were then appointed in each district to take charge of and organize the police power of their districts. This was very ably done by the sheriffs and chiefs of police appointed. A questionnaire was sent to every sheriff and chief of police in the State for the purpose of securing data on the number of peace officers, automobiles, trucks, ambulances, motorcycles, police radio stations, guns, the amount of ammunition, and other equipment in their departments. This has all been compiled, and it is now known ex - actly how much equipment is owned by every law enforcement agency, office, or official in the State. Protection against espionage, sabotage, planned disorders, and major disasters in this emergency will be the principal work under the Nebraska Police Mobilization Plan. During this emergency a great number of men has been deputized by the law enforcement department as special deputy State sheriffs for corporations such as Nebraska defense plants, railroad companies, public power systems, etc. Each man deputized is under bond and all are good law enforcement officers. They will also co-operate under the Police Mobilization Plan and will assist in any emergency. CRIMINAL IDENTIFICATION The bureau of criminal identification works in conjunction with law enforcement officers of Nebraska in the classification, filing, and recording of fingerprint cards and criminal histories of persons arrested in the State. To date there are approximately 250,000 fingerprint cards and criminal histories on file. The bureau also investigates </seg>

The following items are extracts from records of cases on file in the bureau of criminal identification: Assistance was requested in the identification of a dead negro found along the railroad tracks.

More attention was given to the encouragement of teaching safety in the schools, and with the opening of the school term in 1939 a patrolman was transferred from McCook to Omaha, assigned to the rank of acting sergeant, and placed in charge of driver training courses in all Omaha high schools, That program was sponsored and made possible through the effective co-operation of the Omaha Motor Club. Educational activity was carried on through other school systems, radio stations, colleges, and civic organizations in an attempt to stem the rising fatality tide in Nebraska. In February of 1940, three additional cars were purchased for patrol use to increase its coverage and efficiency. Plans were also formulated for the selection and training of new applicants for patrol positions, and to provide "refresher" training/for the patrol personnel. The same procedure was followed in the selection of candidates to at - tend this training camp as was followed in the selection of the original group, with the exception of one preference requirement which lowered the age limits to include applicants between the ages of 25 and 35 years. May 31, 1940 was the closing date for receiving applications. From a group of more than eight hundred men, thirty-five candidates were selected through competitive examinations to attend the training camp. At the completion of the fifth week of camp training, eighteen candidates were selected for patrol assignments. Two reserve candi - dates, trained in the 1937 period, also attended the camp and were as - signed with eighteen new officers on September 4, 1940. With the assignment of the increased personnel, several new headquarters were organized, and new division areas were establish - ed. At this time an officer was designated to assume the responsibility of directing all patrol activity in the educational field, and to co - ordinate the work of the patrol with that of the engineer of traffic and safety education. Similarly an officer was named to standardize and supervise the operator's license examination program conducted by patrol members. Through the issuance of additional accident investi - gation equipment, aids were provided for the subdivision of traffic engineering and accident records. Each change was designed to better utilize the facilities available for the increased benefit of all agencies concerned with the highway safety problem. On i November 1, 1940, the patrol personnel included seventy-four uniformed officers, sixteen of whom were assigned to operator's license examination duties. Fifty-three cars arid eighteen motorcycles were owned by the organization. April 7,1941, saw the addition of another important duty to those already being performed by the organization. On that date, twelve safety patrolmen were assigned to the Fort Crook traffic detail, under the supervision of a lieutenant. With pre-construction traffic flow </seg>
         <seg id="p254">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER reaching peaks of 1,600 cars per hour, obviously some steps had to be taken in an attempt to provide safe travel through the immediate area on Highway No. 75 during the construction of the bomber plant. Rather elaborate preparations were made for the traffic control detail. Observation stations and shelters were built, special communi - cation systems were installed, and the Omaha police department offered the use of their short wave radio transmitter to facilitate the trans - mission of emergency messages. The construction was sufficiently completed to permit the release of the special detail on October 1, 1941. During the construction of Htt^H ¦ .-•' '¦.'¦'¦ '^"'v^iHi Bfl li^ ik^ Observation Station and Shelter Used by Patrol During Construction ol the Fort Crook Bomber Plant the Fort Crook bomber plant and the four-lane highway to Omaha, there were no fatal accidents. Only one personal injury, and property damage of less than 100 dollars from accidents occurred in the area. During this same period the patrol officers made a total of 403 arrests for traffic violations committed on the five-mile stretch of highway. A complete reorganization of the patrol became effective through legislation enacted in April, 1941. This act created the Division of Law Enforcement and Public Safety under the direction of the State En - gineer. The State Sheriff, became Superintendent of Law Enforcement and Public Safety. No personnel changes were made and both agen - cies became a part of the new organization. The plan was designed to promote better and more co-operative law enforcement for the interests of the general public. In accordance with this plan, twelve officers of the patrol were given special instruction under Superintendent Mengel, </seg>
         <seg id="p255">LAW ENFORCEMENT AND PUBLIC SAFETY and on October 15, 1941, they were given commissions as deputy state sheriffs. ¦ On September 16,1941, the captain of the patrol resigned his posi - tion to enter civilian life, and a lieutenant was promoted to assume the responsibility of the administration of the patrol organization. In the spring of 1942, old cars were "traded in," and fifty new patrol cars were placed in service. Four used cars were retained and the total motorized equipment now totals fifty-four cars and twenty motorcycles. During 1942 the patrol personnel has been greatly reduced because of resignations to accept defense positions or leaves of absence granted because of inductions into the armed forces, and at the present time it consists of fifty-two uniformed officers. This number includes eleven officers who are on full- or part-time operator's license exam - ining duty, and one officer who is in the bureau of criminal identifi - cation and investigation. Ten patrolmen are now serving in different branches of the armed forces. Only twenty-seven of the original forty-four officers are/ still with the organization. In 1942 the additional duty of controlling and regulating traffic around defense areas was added to the routine activities of the patrol. This activity has necessitated the changing of headquarters so that officers may be located in the defense areas. At the present time there are 16 war projects located in Nebraska at the following points: Fort Crook, Mead, Lincoln, Grand Island, Hastings, Alliance, Ains - worth, Scottsbluff, McCook, Harvard; Bruning, Fairmont, Scribner, Kearney, and Sidney. The routine activity of the patrol has carried its members into all types of situations. In the educational field, 1,835 safety programs have been presented during the period of November 1,1940 to October 1, 1942. Regular radio presentations have been offered through the co-operation of radio broadcasting stations at Norfolk, Fremont, Grand Island, Kearney, North Platte, and Scottsbluff Undoubtedly thousands of Nebraska listeners as well as residents of border States have heard safety messages through that effective medium. In line with the established policy of the patrol in offering its facilities and co-operation to any police agency; patrol officers have assisted in the! apprehension and conviction of murderers, bank rob - bers, fugitives from penal and hospital institutions, chicken thieves, embezzlers, forgers, robbers, car thieves, and individuals involved in fraud and arson. Officers have engaged in the rescue of persons during blizzards, floods, fires and windstorms.
