What part the so-called macaroni wheats are to take in 
the farm economy of this region is yet to be determined. It 
will depend largely upon their productiveness as compared 
with other crops, and upon their market or feeding values. 
Judged by the first of these considerations, as exhibited in 
the experiments here recorded, macaroni wheat would seem 
to be entitled to a place among the crops of at least a portion 
of Nebraska. The rather extensive distribution of this 
wheat made by the Bureau of Plant Industry of the D. S. 
Department of Agriculture through this Station in 1902 was 
planned by the writer to give information on the following 
points: (1) The productiveness of macaroni wheat as compared 
with other spring varieties or with winter wheat; (2) 
the portions of the state to which it is best adapted; (3) the 
varieties best suited to growth in this region. While it is 
not possible to draw final conclusions from a test during one 
season, it is considered that results of sufficient value have 
been obtained to warrant publication. Especially is this the 
case in view of the large number of inquiries from persons 
wishing to know whether it will be a profitable crop for 
them to raise, and who can best judge of this by knowing 
what success has already been attained by others in the same 
portions of the state For this reason individual tests, accompanied 
by the conditions under which they were made, 
are reported. 

While this bulletin is published for the purpose of making 
known the results of experiments carried on with macaroni 
wheats in this state, it will be of interest to persons who 
may be considering the advisability of undertaking their 
culture to include a short description of the wheats, and of

dence looking towards the possible market for the crop. 

APPEARANCE AND HABITS OF GROWTH OP MACARONI WHEATS. 

The macaroni wheats are so called because they are largely 
used in the manufacture of macaroni and other edible pastes. 
These products are much used for food in Europe, and are 
constantly becoming more widely used in this country. The 
wheats belong to the group Triticum durum, while the common 
wheats, from which bread is made, belong to Triticum 
vulgare. The macaroni wheats are tall, with broad, smooth 
leaves. The heads are heavily bearded, being much more so 
than any of the ordinary wheats, and the plant when 
headed has much the appearance of barley. The heads are 
large and vary in color from light yellow to almost black, 
depending upon the variety. The kernels are large, very 
hard, having less starch than common wheat. They vary 
from light yellow to reddish yellow in color. 

She habits of growth of durum wheats adapt them to 
ons of light rainfall. They have great ability to withd 
drouth and heat, but require a rich soil, although they 
notably tolerant of alkali. 

Bsome mild climates durnm wheats are sown in the fall, 
generally they are grown as spring wheats, and they 
occupy that place in Nebraska at present. 

t principal durum wheat growing countries are Russia, 
Jtan, North Africa, the drier portions of Argentina, 
India, and Asia Minor, and to some extent Spain, 
Greece, Roumania, Mexico, and the Central American 
¦ 

FOREIGN MARKET FOR MACARONI WHEAT. 

One of the. most important considerations in the attempt 
to introduce durum wheat culture into this country is that 
of a market for the crop. What the foreign demand for 
edible pastes has become in the last few years may be appreciated 
by reading the following facts taken from a report by 
Mr. Robert P. Skinner, Consul General at Marseilles: 1 

"US. Department of Agriculture, Bureau of Plant Industry, Bulletin No. 20. </seg>

            <seg id="p005">
Macaroni Wheat*. 

5 

"The European demand for macaroni wheat has increased 
with remarkable rapidity within recent years. The present 
consumption of macaroni wheat by the factories in Marseilles 
alone is 24,000 bushels daily. The output of macaroni 
and edible pastes in that city is limited only by the supply 
of wheat suitable for their manufacture. Throughout the 
entire Mediterranean country there has been a corresponding 
increase in the manufacture of these products. Semolina 
mills have been erected, or are in course of construction, 
in all the important wheat markets, and in the Levant. Perhaps 
the largest semolina mill in the world is one recently 
built at Salonica, which has a daily capacity of over 7,000 
bushels of wheat. 

rie supply of wheat for this large industry is not drawn 
western or northern Europe, as the climate there is 
that the proper quality of wheat can not be raised. 
Large quantities of durum wheats are now imported into 
France and Italy, from Russia and Algeria. These wheats 
make the best quality of macaroni, but owing to their scarcity 
they are frequently mixed with the softer wheats from 
western Europe. Durum wheat from Russian seed is being 
grown in France in considerable quantity, but the product 
even from the first year's crop is not equal to the Russiangrown 
wheat. 

"There would seem to be no reason why there should not 
be a strong and increasing demand for American durum 
wheat to make good the deficiency in the European market." 

HOME MARKET FOR MACARONI WHEAT. 

Kcerning the home market for durum wheats, Mr. M. A. 
on, Cerealist of the U. S. Department of Agriculture, 
i as follows: 1 

While the prospects are very good for a foreign market for these 
wheats sufficient to utilize probably all that we can produce for sereTal 
years, an excellent market is also likely to be developed sooner or later 
in our own macaroni factories. At present all these factories, with rare 
exceptions, use the flour of common bread wheats in their operations. 
Of course this is chiefly due to the fact that heretofore it has been impossible 
to obtain true macaroni wheats in this country, and it is considered 

'U. S. DepL of Act., Bureau of Plant Industry, Bull. No. 3. </seg>

            <seg id="p006">

Macaroni Wheats. 

impracticable to Import them. Most of the factories realize the importance 
of using the semolina of such wheats as soon as they can obtain 
It in sufficient amount and of good quality. It will certainly be of the 
greatest advantage to the factories as well as to the growers to establish 
trade between them In the use of these wheats. The factories will thus 
be able to obtain either the wheats or semolina made from them at 
much less cost than the imported material, and the farmers will have 
the benefit of a quick home market. 

S other strong advantage in using these wheats in our own factories, 
»hich especially affects the consumer, lies in the fact that the 
nade product, other conditions being equal, is always much better 
the standpoint of simple freshness. We all know how much better 
bread is than old, and what a nutty flavor newly-made flour gives 
! bread. These facts apply with even greater force in macaroni 
ig. All imported macaronis must of necessity have lost a large 
:nt of their flavor, and as the homemade product is made almost 
ly from common wheats, it follows that the majority of American 
really have never tasted the very best macaroni. 

More than all else the use of macaroni as a food is far from general 
in this country, and should become more popular. It is a comparatively 
rare food with us. As already quoted in another place, in France alone 
the annual output of edible pastes is estimated at from 120,000,000 to 
170,000,000 pounds. A considerable amount of this is of course exported, 
but there remains an enormous amount which is consumed in France. 
These pastes are among the most common and popular foods in that 
country. The same may be said of Italy. Let a sufficient amount of 
good wheat be grown and our factories begin producing from these 
wheats its best article possible, in a variety of forms, and there is no 
good reason apparent why such foods should not soon rank in popularity 
with our breakfast foods. 

ONE HUNDRED AND ONE TESTS THROUGHOUT NEBRASKA. 

E durum wheats distributed in the spring of 1902 conof 
a number of varieties, most of which were imported 
ly from Algeria and the remainder from Russia, except 
a small amount grown in this country. It is perhaps unfortunate 
that more of the seed was not of Russian origin, 
for the results indicate very plainly that it is more productive 
than that from Algeria. Previous experience has also 
shown that seed grown at least one year in this region gives 
larger yields than imported seed. This, together with the 
fact that the season was not such as has been considered 
tvorable for the growth of this crop, has made the test a 
vere one. 

Most of the experimenters received one bushel of seed 
which it was expected would be sown on one acre of land. 
No attempt was made to prescribe in what manner the land 
was to be prepared for the seed, or how the seed was to be </seg>

sown. These and other unknown conditions that always 
enter into a test of this kind make it impossible to draw more 
than general conclusions, and make it desirable to report 
individual tests so far as space will permit. The following 
is the tabulated experience of each experimenter, omitting 
from necessity much interesting information that accompanied

Es average yield of winter wheat in Nebraska for 1902 
according to Bulletin No. 2 (Sept, 1902) of the Nea 
Bureau of Labor and Industrial Statistics, 24 bushels 
:re, and of spring wheat 12 bushels. The average yield 
11 durum wheats tested in 1902 was 18.3 bushels per 
The durum wheats were grown principally in western 
ies, while the others were distributed over the state. 

K)m the data at hand it is safe to say that durum wheats 
better than other spring varieties, but how they comin 
this respect with winter wheat in western Nebraska 
ot be definitely stated at this time. 

There were a number of reports of the durum wheats haring 
rusted and lodged. Those raised at the Station were 
very badly rusted, and also lodged in places. They appeared 
to be fully as susceptible to rust as other varieties of spring

The average time of ripening was July 16, both for the 
tests made throughout the state, and for those made at the 
Station. The average time of ripening for sowings made 
before April 1 was the same as for those made after April 1. 

The average yield of all sowings made before April 1 was 
19.5 bushels per acre; of all sowings made after April 1, 17.5 
bushels per acre. This indicates that, for at least the year 
reported, early planting was desirable. As macaroni wheats 
are not easily injured by frost, this rule will doubtless hold 
good for all ordinary years. 

The average yield per acre and number of tests of each 

variety were as follows :

there were less than five tests, 

Omitting varieties of which 

the average yield per acre for the Russian varieties was 21.2 
bushels, and for the Algerian varieties 17.6 bushels. 

A test of a number of varieties of durum wheats was made 
at the Experiment Station. The unusually wet weather and 
hard windstorms interfered much with the growth of the 
wheats, and doubtless decreased the yields. The test is therefore 
of less value than it would have been in a normal season. 
All varieties were planted March 20 to 27 and were put in 
with a press drill.

While the variety test at 

the 

Station is not 

satisfac- 

very 

tory as indicating the variety 

best adapted to our 

conditions, 

it brings out strongly the 

superiority 

of the 

Russian 


ties. Thus, the average yield 

for all Russian 

varieties 

is 12.7 

bushels per acre, and for all Algerian varieties 8.1 bushels. </seg>
