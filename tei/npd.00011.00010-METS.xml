principal meridian. " The County Superintendents through a 
committee accepted and adopted the following report on the 
normal school question: 

REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON THE NORMAL SCHOOL QUESTION 

Whereas, the prevalent feeling — to our shame be it said — has 
been that any one who knew the rudiments and could keep 
ahead of his pupils was sufficiently qualified to teach an 
elementary school; and 

Whereas, We believe the teacher's work is the foundation and 
safeguard of our political institutions ; that we look upon the 
teacher's duties as the incarnation of [h\gh morality; and that 
when we consider the conflicts to be waged with ignorance and 
vice, we may well think of the teacher as the soldier of a hundred 
battles; and 

K Whereas, The opportunities provided by the state for the 
•fessional training of her teachers is not commensurate with 
i demands and needs of the hour : 

Iherefore be it resolved, That we favor two state normal 
schools for Nebraska, located one on each side of the sixth 
principal meridian ; 

E 'solved, That we also favor the establishment of Junior or 
imer Term Normal at from three to five points in 
state where public school buildings may be secured for the 
Dose without expense to the state. 

Nos. 28, 29, 31 and 32 were also accepted and adopted unanimously 
by the Educational Council. The County Superintendents 
adopted No. 28 in the above report of the committee, 
and also adopted Nos. 29, 30, 31 and 32. The Educational Council 
amended No. 30 by adding : ' 'Your committee believes that 
twenty per cent of "the total appropriation of the state should 
be devoted to an educational exhibit. " </seg>

I copy of the State Course of Study has been placed in the 
ds of every teacher and officially adopted by the school 
rds of the county. This makes it possible for the superinlent 
to insist that the course be followed and its provisions 
¦ied out. As a further aid in carrying out this work, the 
erintendent will issue examination questions for every 
3e, based on the work outlined in the State Course. These 
stions will be issued every two months, beginning with 

Certificates of perfect attendance are being used throughout 
the county this year for the first time, and I am convinced 
from reports of teachers that much good is being accomplished. 
Tardiness has already been reduced eighty-five per cent as 
compared with the reDorts of other years and it seems reasonable 
to presume that tardiness will be eliminated to the extent 
that it will be the exception rather than the rule to have 
students late in the morning. In many districts the attendance 
is being materially increased by reason of these certificates. 

Eonthly Reports to parents are furnished to each teacher, 
se reports fully advise the parents of the standing and 
jress of each pupil at the close of each month. 

At a school board meeting held on the first day of July, 1902, 
the State Course of Study was adopted and a unanimous resolution 
adopted favoring county uniformity of text books. In 
accord with this resolution, the superintendent appointed a 
committee of experienced teachers to select the text books to 
be used, and sent the joint report of these committees with 
the names of books selected, address of publishers and prices 
— introductory and exchange, in a neat folder, to every 
teacher and school board in the county. Accompanying this 
price list was a return postal card, upon which the board of 
each district was asked to accept the report and make the 
selected list the books for exclusive use. About one hundred </seg>

of the districts have already officially adopted this list and 
a new list of up-to-date text books is rapidly displacing the 
antiquated text books. 

A competitive examination was held by the superintendent 
in every town of the county from April 24th to May 6th, 1902, 
at which places not only the eighth grade pupils of the town 
schools but also of the country districts took the examinations. 
A carefully tabulated report showing the standings of each and 
every school, as well as individual standings, was sent out in 
which the weak points of each school were held up to public 
view. As a result every school is bringing up its deficiencies 
and strengthening its weak points. This 'examination has 
proved such a stimulus to thorough work, both on the part of 
pupils and teachers, that it will be continued. These examinations 
are made a test of fitness for entrance to the high school, 
and diplomas are granted all who pass the examination 
satisfactorily. 

Ell the high schools of Antelope county are open to nondents 
under the provisions of the adjunct district law, which 
it into effect at the beginning of the present school year, 
ing carried at the annual meetings June 30th, 1902, by a vote 
97 to 136. 

Fifty-one school libraries have been placed in the country 
schools since January, 1902, at an average cost of $40.00 each. 

K\ school directory was issued in August showing the finan-1 
standing of each district, as well as all data with reference 
the attendance, expenditures and general conditions of the 
lools. 

Exports giving the attendance of all pupils under the comsory 
law are filed in the office of the county superintendent 
the close of each month. These reports are carefully 
eked up and those not complying with the requirements 
inaptly notified. 

All teachers are required to do the Beading Circle work as 
outlined by the State Board. The county is divided into six 

sections. Each section has a presiding officer and a secretary, 

El meets once each month. A strict record is kept of the

BANNER COUNTY 

K'wing to the scarcity of teachers, many of our districts will 
be able to have a fall term, as desired, but will have the 
uired number of months during the winter and spring. 

There are at present some undesirable conditions here, bat 
we hope to report them rectified in the near future. 

We are making an effort to grade or at least systematize the 
schools. 

E r e have no nigh school here, owing to the sparsely settled 
itory surroundiug our county seat, but many of our pupils

An effort is being made to organize a Reading Circle, and we 
hope to meet with some success in that line. 

rie teachers are doing good work, considering that a great 
cent of them are inexperienced. 

Khey all take at least one educational paper and some of 
n more. 

Teachers' wages have been raised some the past school year. 

IVfany of the directors consult the superintendent in regard 
the capabilities of applicants and in nearly every case are 
lling to pay a higher salary to the most competent of these ; 
jrefore we prophesy a marked improvement in these schools. 

Ebt many years ago a number of the districts were deeply in

BLAINE COUNTY 

I[ take pleasure in saying that the schools of Blaine county

creasing, hence teachers' salaries are increasing and instead

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

Patrons are taking greater interest than ever before, and all 
seem anxious to give their children that which can never be 
taken from them — a good education. 

There are nine districts and two fractional districts in good 
working order, and a petition is being circulated for the 
organization of a new district. 

In regard to the institute work, I am sorry to say that I 
have held no institute for two years, owing to the scarcity of 
teachers in the county ; but I expect to have a session of at 
least one week next year. While we are unable to boast of a 
great number of teachers, we are proud of those that we have, 
and are thankful to be able to secure good work from teachers 
of other counties. 

Mrs. P. T. Miner. 

BOONE COUNTY 

The educational spirit in Boone county was never better 
than at the present time. 

There are seventy-nine districts in the county with a school 
population of 4,347. 

There are five graded schools. Albiou has thirteen teachers 
and a census roll of 599 ; Cedar Rapids seven teachers, census 
327; Petersburg six teachers, census 268; St. Edward six 
teachers, census 210; Boone two teachers, census 57. These 
schools are all under excellent management and are doing 
splendid work. 

The Nebraska Course of Study is used in every country 
school in the county. I have earnestly urged the teachers to 
consult the Teachers' Manual each day until they are thoroughly 
acquainted with its plans. 

Ninety-five t&gt;er cent of the teachers are studying "Waymarks 
for Teachers" and "Hodge's Nature Study and Life." 

The county is divided into six sections, and each secretary 
keeps a complete record of work done. 

There has been a marked increase this year over former 
years in the salaries paid teachers. 

The great needs today are a better high school law and a 
means by which the country schools may be brought under 
closer supervision.

BOX BUTTE COUNTY 

During the past two years the number of districts in this 
county has been reduced from sixty-four to fifty-seven by consolidation, 
and still some of the districts have a small number 
of pupils although containing territory six miles square. 

E r e are striving to aid our teachers to a better preparation 
their work in holding a summer normal last year and will 
1 one again next year of four weeks. 

Eages have increased about five dollars a month in the last 
years. Two years ago none of our rural teachers received 
e than $30.00 a month, whereas last year nine received 
e than that amount and this year fifteen are receiving §35.00. 

Our teachers have held quarterly examinations during the 
last two years and I have held annual examinations for those 
completing the Eighth Grade. This has been the means of 
making a marked improvement in the work uf our schools and 
has added to the interest in the schools on the part of t^ie 

Ejhool officers have been more willing to supply needed apitus 
and to purchase better furniture, so that a larger numof 
schools are now supplied with patent desks and refer!

BROWN COUNTY 

The county comprises a territory of over 1200 square miles, 
with forty-five districts and a school population of about 
1,300. Seven of these districts are fractional districts with 
Cherry, Blaine, and Rock counties. Two are high school districts, 
Ainsworth and Long Pine, with four teachers each. 

Three years ago the teacher's salary in five districts was 
$20 a month, and only one rural district paid as high as $30. 
This year no district is paying less than $25 a month, and half 
the districts are paying $30. I found some schoolhouses in remote 
parts of the county without a blackboard and other necessary 
supplies. These schools are now as well supplied as 
those nearer towns. Slate blackboards have largely replaced 
the old wooden ones. Walls are being decorated with flags, 
maps and instructive .pictures. Undoubtedly there will be a </seg>

Ebraries have been established in more than half the dish. 
The state course of study is taken as a guide and 
sly followed. 

Irregular attendance at school is being overcome by the use 
of certificates of perfect attendance, which prove quite an incentive. 
Report cards and test questions aid in g*radation of 
school work throughout the county. Seventeen rural school 
students took the eighth grade examination last spring ; three 
passed. I hope to have five times the above number of students 
take the examination next spring with more encouraging

A four weeks' summer school was held last year, 
ns are being made for a teachers' entertainment during inute 
next year, the proceeds of which will be used for the 
iblishment of a teachers' library. 

I^e majority of teachers give due attention to Reading 
cle work, but it is impossible for some to meet in the inters 
of the Association and Reading Circle work while teach. 
A regular and systematic plan of of Association work 
being conducted. Teachers attending Associations and 
ing an active part are entitled to a Teacher's Professional 
erest Certificate. There is a deficiency in the teaching force 
account of low salaries. Teachers are going where they 
t demand higher wages, while others resort to other lines 
.work. Though many teachers are young, they deserve 
dit for their interest and loyalty to the profession. 

Eis a source of pleasure to testify that in my efforts to 
race the cause of popular education, I have received 
support of a majority of school board officers and the

BURT COUNTY 

Every year Nebraska takes a step forward. Her productive 
fields attract men of energy, intellect and wealth. Under their 
skill, rolling plains, have turned to golden harvest fields and 
traders' posts to populous cities. Thirty years ago slow moving 
ox trains dragged from the quarry the foundation stones 
that were to form a part of the then solitary building known 
as the University of Nebraska. From a half dozen instructors 
and a mere handful of students this institution has grown to a 
place of first importance in the educational west. Apace with 
and vastly responsible for this great advancement is the development 
of the common schools. Burt county is in the vanguard 
of this advancing column. Her people, though thrifty, 
are not too busy to measure the importance of the school. One 
hundred teachers are required to fill all the positions in the 
rural and city schools. All have had high school training and 
a majority have had the advantages of a normal or university 
course. Less than ten per cent are teaching their first term of 
school. The principals of the various city schools are men of 
long experience or superior training. 

One hundred and fourteen teachers attended the institute 
held at Tekamah during the week beginning August 18. All 
have shown professional interest in institute, reading circle 
and teachers' meetings. One of the greatest needs in the rural

schools of Nebraska is systematic work. The course of studymakes 
this condition possible and every rural school in the 
county is making use of our present one. 

Great interest was shown in the eighth grade examination 
this year. When pupils know that they can complete a regularly 
prescribed course and receive a diploma that will admit 
them without examination to any High school in the county 
they will work with far greater interest in the rural school. 

Our school districts are in good condition financially. Very 
few of them carry a bonded indebtedness. A majority have a 
surplus in the treasury. Many of the buildings in the rural 
districts have been built for a quarter of a century. The increase 
in the size of the schools now makes new buildings a 
necessity everywhere and a great many of the old structures 
will give way next year to modern architecture. School boards 
and patrons are giving more attention to the proper lighting 
and heating of the new school houses and to the sanitary conditions 
in general. We are planning for a meeting of the 
school boards the coming year when we hope that a permanent 
organization may be effected. Euoene Brookings. 

BUTLER COUNTY 

Ptie population of Butler county is 15,703; its area is 557 
ire miles; it was organized in 1868. The county ranks 
th in the number of miles of railroad, having 134.27 
is. The counties of the state exceeding it in this respect 
Lancaster, Nuckolls and Gage. 

During my four years' incumbency of the office of county 
superintendent I have each year put special emphasis upon 
some phase of school supervision. Last year it was teachers' 
meetings in seven divisions. This year I would emphasize 
Reading Circle work and compulsory attendance. 

In our association work we have monthly meetings in each 
division in which the work of the Beading Circle is 
thoroughly handled and other questions relative to teaching 
are discussed. As many as ninety per cent of the entire 
teaching force of the county have been present at these meetings. 
The teachers find the work of the Reading Circle pleasant 
and profitable, and fully seventy -five per cent of them are 
doing the work. </seg>

COUNTY AND CITY SCHOOLS. 

In order to enforce the compulsory attendance law of 1901 
we have made a large register in which we have had copied 
the names of all children in the countv between the ages of 
seven and fourteen. This list was obtained from the census 
reports of the directors. Upon the receipt of the teachers' 
monthly reports each child enrolled is credited with the number 
of days he attended during the month. This way, while 
it necessitates much work upon the part of the superintendent, 
is very effective in its results. 

In our report for the last biennium we spoke of a little 
school paper published monthly, The Public School. It was 
largely an experiment then, but now it has become an assured 
thing, and is looked upon by all acquainted with it as a means 
of accomplishing much good. 

Our teachers, as a rule, do not hesitate to spend their money 
for more schooling, thereby getting a better preparation for 
their work. This, we feel, is indicative of a very healthy educational 
sentiment. Gene Loomis, 1898-1901. 

BUTLER COUNTY 

Iiutler county keeps her regular" beats" of doing the best 
the advancement of educational matters, so that today it is

the supposed ones to teach and promote the welfare of the 
ool children, but the public as a unit is proud of the school 
•k of the county. The interest that the public takes in 
cational progress is well attested by the attendance at our 
ual educational conventions held at the county seat. These 
ventions are, so to speak, educational festivals where 
pie partake of the spirit of some of the foremost educators 
ihe state who are available for such occasions. 

Ewo new school houses were built during the past year and 
rly all our schools are well supplied with slate boards, maps 
other up-to-date appliances. The free text- book law is 
¦ practically in force in all of the ninety-three districts. 

Another marked improvement is the average length of the 
school year . This for the present year is the highest in the 
history of the county. AJmajority of our rural schools pay 
over $35'a month tojthe teachers while some reach the $50 mark.

the quarterly test questions based on the new Course of Study, 
and the little paper published monthly by the superintendent 
help to keep the work in unison. 8y comparison of the work 
of the different schools rivalry for the best is indirectly created 
among the teachers. 

The situation of villages in the county is such that the 
Teachers' Reading Circle work is divided into eight sections. 
Such divisions are within comfortable reach of the teachers 
and nearly all, are pursuing the work. The enrollment this 
year has reached about ninety per cent of our teachers, which 
is substantial proof of the interest manifested. 

The quarterly test questions afford an opportunity to enter 
the results on the pupils' report cards and in that way help to 
keep the parents in touch with the school work. The teacher, 
in order to use the questions, is indirectly obliged to follow the 
course of study and thereby the uniformity of the work is aided.

CASS COUNTY 

Eass county has one hundred school districts, in thirteen of 
ch are graded schools employing from two to twenty-eight 
:hers. 

The graded school is becoming an effective educational 
institution whose influence is growing'more evident each year* 
Fifty-two per cent of our school popul ation is enrolled in the 
graded schools, 'and forty-eight per cent in the rural schools. 
Eighty-three per cent of all the children in the thirteen graded 
school districts are enrolled in] school, while seventy-two per 
cent of the children in the eighty-seven rural districts are </seg>

823 

enrolled. Fifty-nine per cent of all the children in the 
thirteen graded school districts are in attendance every day, 
but the eighty-seven runal districts show only forty -one percent 
of the children in attendance every day. 

There are expended to maintain the schools in the thirteen 
districts $40,385.41, and $35,293.70 in the eighty-seven districts, 
but the expense per pupil, according to the enrollment, is 
$12.58 in the graded schools and $13.16 in the rural schools, 
and computed on the basis of average attendance, the cost of 
maintenance in the rural districts is $'22.79 per pupil, but in 
the graded schools only $17.47. 

Thus we see that while more money is expended for educational 
purposes in the thirteen graded school districts than 
in the eighty-seven rural districts, nevertheless the cost of 
education is less per pupil in the former case than in the 
latter. In other words, the graded schools are better managed 
from a business standpoint. I do not mean that the officers of 
the rural distiicts lack ability in a business sense or that they 
necessarily neglect their duty, but that conditions are such 
that it is impossible to transact the business of the rural 
schools as economically and expeditiously as can be done under 
the conditions existing in the graded school districts. It is 
the system that is at fault and the rural school officer is unable 
to remedy the defects. But this is not all. All the thirteen 
districts except one (which has eight months) have nine 
months of school, but of the eighty-seven rural districts only 
forty-four have nine months, while thirty-two have eight 
months, six have seven months, and five have only six months 
of school. 

iLgain, there are some districts in the county in which the 
sndance is so small that there is no life, no interest, either 
the part of pupils or teacher. For most of the past year 
) district had but two children in attendance. Thus it is 
y for the expense in such districts to run up to $50 and 960 
ear for each pupil enrolled. It is my opinion that many of 
i rural schools are the most expensive institutions in exisce 
compared with the returns, at least they are among the 
st expensive. 

Our people are beginning to appreciate these things. During 
the past year they have paid out for tuition to these graded </seg>

schools $ 1,462.25, a part of which was for pupils entered below 
the high school grades. This money is private and paid out 
by the parents of pupils or the pupils* themselves. In other 
ways we see the growth of public sentiment. District No. 90, 
a small school two miles from Alvo, has been closed and the 
children are being transported in an enclosed wagon to the 
town school. Every body interested seems highly pleased 
with the working of the plan. District No. 57^ has closed a 
small school in the country and the children are admitted 
to the town school of South Bend. Our people are watching 
these two cases very closely. A year ago in June the proposition 
to establish an Adjunct District was defeated by a 
vote of two to one. This year the same proposition was 
carried by a small majority. Unfortunately, our County Commissioners 
assert that the law is unconstitutional and have 
refused to make the necessary levy, thereby rendering the law 
of no effect. We are awaiting further developments.

CLAY COUNTY 

Eie people of Clay county are interested in educational 
ers in general, and especially in the schools of the 
ty and are disposed to support them as liberally as seems 
iem necessary. 

I he principal difficulty in the way of greater success is a 
c of uniformity and constancy of plan and purpose in carryon 
the work. This is shown in the frequent changing of 
jhers, textbooks and course of study. The remedy seems 
ie in the direction of more general information in regard 
he things needful to the best interests of the schools and 
y be furnished through the press, through frequent consnces 
and through public meetings. 

The school boards of the county last winter organized a 
county association with a central board of nine members 
who have shown a commendable zeal in their work. They 
have held several meetings, have adopted a course of study 
for the common schools of the county and shown a decided 
interest in increasing both regularity and punctuality of attendance 
in the various schools. The annual meeting of the 
school boards is set for the Tuesday after the second Monday 
in January of each year. </seg>

COUNTY AND CITY SCHOOLS. 

Most of the teachers of the county have had some experience 
in the work of teaching. As a class they are energetic and 
ambitious and are doing good work. A few good teachers 
have gotten into the wrong places and are likely to illustrate 
the subject of "Misfits". The method of selecting teachers is 
often very faulty. It is a fact greatly to be regretted that the 
number of male teachers in the county is constantly decreasing. 
One reason for this is the low wages paid in many of 
the schools, taken with the fact that there are every year many 
young ladies, graduates of our numerous high schools, who 
are anxious to teach for low wages and the experience. So 
the young man who is ambitious teaches in the common schools 
only as a stepping stone to something else or while waiting 
for a civil service appointment to be given him. He wants 
something more lucrative and more permanent. 

The aim of the superintendent is to so unify and systematize 
the work that there will be uniformity both in text books and 
in studies; to raise the standard of the teaching force and to 
raise the wages paid for the work. In this way it is hoped to 
retain a larger percentage of the most efficient teachers in the 
schools of the county. There seems to be no definite opposition 
to the efforts in these directions although those engaged 
in the work are almost painfully aware of the fact that large 
bodies move slowly. 

f 'tiring the fall and early winter months it is planned to hold 
eral educational rallies at different points in the county, 
ting in this way to impart some information and to quicken 
public sense upon educational matters. C. W. Hemry.

bring the parent, teacher, school officer and pupil into closer 
relation and sympathy with each other. Officers' and patrons' 
meetings were held in connection with the teachers' institute. 
Local patrons' meetings in different parts of the county were 
held at night during the fall and winter months. At these 
meetings questions relating to the care of the buildings and 
grounds, text books, sanitation, duties of parents and teacher 
were fully and freely discussed. This idea, which has since 
been partially enacted into law, is being vigorously prosecuted 
during the present administration. The results have been 
very marked in the erection of many substantial buildings, 
better kept grounds, more modern text books, the establishment 
of libraries, and, most of all, the active co-operation 
of parents has been secured. Until such a time as the liberality 
of oar law-makers will allow the county superintendent in 
counties having a greater number of schools than he can personally 
supervise, a corps of assistants that will make close 
organization and supervision possible, his work must be done 
in a large measure through officers', patrons' and teachers' 
organizations. 

I he first step necessary to meet the financial handicap inres 
a more equitable distribution of the state school funds 
a now obtains. Under our present method of apportionment 
rural schools in the most populous and wealthy counties are 
aany instances wholly supported by funds derived from the 
e, while in those counties less fortunate in population and 
Jth a mere pittance is received. This is not as it should 
A district with a given number of children located in the 
rsely populated county of McPherson should receive the 
le consideration in the distribution of these funds as one 
h the same number of children in any other part of the 
be. Other measures including a more general distribution 
taxes paid by railroads and other public corporations are 
sessary to provide an entirely satisfactory remedy.

-cers, due to the efforts of my predecessor in office, are becoming 
more interested in their schools, while the general prosperity 
of the country is seen in the decreasing debts, the longer 
terms of school and the more substantial school buildings. 

Among the special improvements of the year are : first, an 
organization of school officers. This association took as its 
model the organization in Pillmore county, meets quarterly, 
and at its last meeting formally adopted the 1902 State Course 
of Study; second, an earnest attempt upon the part of the 
teachers to classify and unify their work in accord with the 
State Course of Study ; third, the establishment of a monthly 
school paper printed entirely in the county and visiting teachers 
and school officers. In addition to these features might be 
mentioned the recommendation and the partial adoption of a 
new series of text books for the county, the system of award 
certificates for perfect attendance of pupils and the written 
review or monthly exaninations sent to the various schools for 
examination of pupils. 

iPhis short synopsis would not be complete, however, without 
ntion of at least two things less favorable to the educational 
erests — namely, a scarcity of teachers with consequently a 
rrower range of selection and the decrease in the popularity 
The Free Text Book Law. This unpopularity, while spring* 
from a legitimate cause, is a menace to the success of nearly 
ery school where it obtains. 

In conclusion, permit Custer county to thank the State Department 
of Public Instruction for the energetic yet conservative 
administration of the past year, and at the same time to 
renew its pledge to work unceasingly for the cardinal object 
set before ua — the improvement of the rural school.

DAKOTA COUNTY 

I.n reporting the condition of schools in Dakota county, I 
nk I am justified in saying that the'y compare very favorably 
th the schools in counties having no large educational cens. 
The districts are small and as a result a number are in 
i condition financially. All the districts own the text books, 
i are quite well supplied with apparatus. The text books, 
wever, are poorly selected. </seg>

Es to the schools, we are progressing. The teachers begin 
;e the necessity for professional training and better prepion 
for the work. Every teacher has a copy of the Course 
tudy and most of the schools are graded to the same. 

After taking the office in January, a teachers' association 
was organized and two very successful meetings were held before 
the summer vacation. At the institute this summer we 
perfected the organization and will hold three general county 
sessions the coming year. 

Institute was held the last week in August and was a success. 
As fully ninety per cent of the teachers have primary 
work, we did well in securing the services of an expert primary 
teacher. In presenting this work, Miss Lucy S. Williams 
won the confidence of every teacher in attendance, and 
as a result the little ones will have better instruction than ever 
before. Superintendent C. R. Atkinson's work in the advanced 
studies and Miss Sullivan's work in reading and literature 
were highly aporeciated. 

The Reading Circle work has not heretofore been done to 
any extent. There are a good number doing the work now, 
and in addition to this we are making arrangements to put a 
teachers' library in the county superintendent's office. The 
teachers subscribe quite liberally to periodicals designed to 
-help them in their work. 

Eie adjunct district proposition did not carry in this county,

others kept out of school because of the expense.

DODGE COUNTY 

The county has eighty-two whole, and three fractional 
districts. The school population, including the city of Fremunt, 
is 7,982. Of this number, 6,572 attended school last 
year. Including" the Fremont Normal School, there are six 
private schools in the county. The total enrollment of these 
schools the past year was 1,759. 

The schools of the county require 161 teachers, but the number 
of applicants for certificates last year was considerably 
larger, reaching 232. Nine of the districts in the county have 
two or more departments. </seg>

The salaries paid teachers have increased. The lowest salary 
paid in the district schools is $30, and the highest is $66 a. 
month. The average number of months of school held in the 
county last year was 8.75, and this year it will be about the 

IFhere is but little indebtedness among the districts at the 
anty, and many of them had a surplus after paying the coat 
running the schools the past year. 

Many of the districts have outgrown their school building* 
and during the past two years their old ones have been replaced 
by larger and more modern structures. Two new buildings 
are now being erected, and will be ready to be occupied 
in a short time. 

For the Teachers' Associations and Reading Circle work, I 
have adopted the plan put in operation by my predecessor. 
The county is divided into five sections, and each suction meets 
four times each year. At these meetings topics of educational 
value are taken up in addition to the regular Beading drafts 
work. We have two central associations each year. At these 
the teachers of the different sections meet in one body and review, 
to some extent, the work done in the local sections. Oar 
Institute, which began August 1«, and continued one week, 
was one of the largest and most enthusiastic ever held in the 
county. There were 150 teachers in attendance. The interest 
manifested by those present speaks well for the professional 
spirit in the countv. In presenting the work, the aim was 
method rather than matter. 

Etie Illinois Course of Study has been our guide for the past 
years, but after this year we will use the new Nebraska 
rse.

lot think it meets the demands. 

tis to be regretted that we have so few male teachers in 
county. Of the 116 teachers required for the schools, 
b are but nineteen male teachers. 

We have this year eleven inexperienced teachers, but most 
of our teachers have had professional training, and I do not 
believe that there is a county in the state that can boast of a 
better corps of teachers than Dodge county has at the present 
time. We have had good work in the past, and I look forward 
to even better work in the future. Charles Arnot. 

DOUGLAS COUNTY 

At no time in the history of Douglas county has the general 
interest in our schools been more pronounced than at the present. 
Tne teachers, scholars and patrons are of one accord for 
the betterment of the schools. The study qf the teachers, the 
regular attendance of the scholars, and the many visits to the 
schools by the parents all tend to prove the above statement. 

The Free High School Law has been a strong factor in producing 
better interest in school work. Eighth grade scholars 
have passed from the greater number of our country schools 
and as the scholar or class has left a school other children become 
interested soon to follow and take advantage of the Free 
High School Law. 

Last year the high schools of Omaha, Valley and Waterloo 
were opened to country children under this law, and the following 
amounts will be received for tuition: Omaha, $480.75; 
Waterloo, $173.75; Valley, $439. 50. The districts will receive 
their share of the tuition when the taxes are paid for the year 
1902. No tax was levied last year by the Board of County 
Commissioners, but this year they made one sufficient to pay 
tuition for last year and this year also. 

I am not satisfied with our Compulsory Education Law. I 
will admit that good has come from that law, yet I claim that 
very little has been done compared with what should be done 
with such a law. In many cases the very children that should 
be compelled to attend school are not reached. This is due to 
quite a few reasons, but the most prominent one, the one that </seg>

can be most easily remedied, is the one relative to th*» truant 
officer, or in other words that part of oar law that puta into 
the hands of our school boards the duty to appoint • truant 
officer or to act as such themselves. In many cane* thin 1mm 
never been done by our boards and what is more never will be 
done. The reason is evident and can be stated in a very few 
words, — the board members do not can* to have trouble

let us have a county truant officer appointed by some authority, 
whose duty shall be to work in conjunction with the ooamtf 
superintendent's office, and manv scholars now oat of school 
and otherwise impossible to reach will be brought into oar 
schools. 

We have adopted for our Reading Circle work this year 
Hodge's "Nature Study and Life" and Murphy's "Turning 
Points in Teaching." The work is being quite faithfully doas) 
by every teacher in the county. E. J. Bodwu,L 

FRANKLIN COUNTY 

E Regarding Franklin county from the viewpoint of an •*¦ 
nty superintendent, I can frankly say that the year 1902 
been one of reasonable progress in public school interest*. 

The number of teachers has not greatly exceeded the uumber 
uf schools, which condition has made it possible, for experienced, 
well-prepared teachers to engage their services at an 
increase of wages. The inexperienced ones here, as elsewhere, 
are overpaid. 

A professional circulating library has been created by the 
teachers and county superintendent which has afforded a wide 
range of cultural, informational and pedagogical reading. A 
keen interest has followed its use. 

§'he present year is the twelfth in succession to continae tne 
te Reading Circle studies. From a nominal and superficial 
inning it has experienced a steady growth. Now it is coo;red 
a necessary adjunct to the public school system. 

K\ praiseworthy introduction of the newer ideas in text books 
geography, reading and arithmetic has bean effected, and a 
&gt;st satisfactory attitude toward nature study and science te 
l grades is noticeable. </seg>

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

Teachers are minimizing and alternating studies toward 
securing fewer recitations and longer periods during the day's 
session. The New Teachers' Manual has brought this about. 

Khere is a marked increase in the number of pupils taking 
eighth grade county examination and an improved scholar&gt; 
shown in the written papers. 

We see a tendency among patrons and officers toward a 
higher rate of taxation and a longer term. Some of the 
smaller districts are discussing consolidation and transportation 
of pupils. Ed M. Hussong, 1898-1901. 

FRANKLIN COUNTY 

Re present prosperous condition of the schools of this 
ty is due in no small measure to the close and efficient 
E vision of the past eight years. There is a spirit of proand 
a demand for the best that bas been growing up, 
y, perhaps, but none the less surely. School officers demand 
the best teachers, who, in turn, ask for better training 
and the best obtainable talent for the institute. 

It is gratifying to note the drift of sentiment toward larger 
districts and better schools. District No. 10 sets the excellent 
example of enlarging its schoolhouse and employing two 
teachers. This will be the first rural school of the county to 
follow this very wise plan. Within the next year we hope to 
see a weak rural district merged into the neighboring village 
district. 

Etie Reading Circle work is well supported in all parts of 
county and affords an excellent means of professional culture. 
With seven points having local circles, no teacher need 
find it inconvenient to attend these helpful and inspiring meetings. 
All teachers are pledged and required to attend, and 
nearly all have secured the necessary book and have begun the 
work. A county professional library is an adjunct to the 
year's equipment. This we hope to be helpful in keeping up 
interest throughout the year. The books purchased this year 
will form the nucleus of a good library for future use. 

A county school paper is issued by the superintendent and 
will furnish means of communication with and direction of 
the work. This idea is well received by teachers and school 
officers, who are giving it hearty support. </seg>


            <seg id="p232">
833 

There has been difficulty in securing a sufficient number of 
competent teachers for our schools this year. This condition 
is due, no doubt, to the bountiful crops of this year and con— 
quent abnndance of remunerative employment. There are 
now. forty-nine first gn.de certificates, seventy-three second 
grade and six third grades in force in this county. Above 
forty pupils received the common school diploma from tbia 
office at the close of the school year, l'&gt; Kightwn of 
these were from the rural schools. The question of the adjunct 
district received a much more favorable vote than it did 
one year ago. 

There is a perceptible increase in the average length of the 
school term of this coming year over that of last year. 

These are some of the visible signs of the progressive t] 
among teachers, pupils, and patrons. 

For the first time in the history of the county the office of 
the superintendent has had a permanent home in the court 
house. It was formerly maintained in the home of the ineonbent 
officer. Now it has a small but pleasant and convenient 
room in the court house. This is proving to be of decided advantage 
over the old plan and of much greater convenience. 

While the Franklin Academy and our high schools have been 
doing heroic work in supplying our schools with compel— I 
teachers, the need of an accessible normal school is seriously 
felt. Our schools need better trained teachers. 

Another is a livelier sense of the value of school training 
for the children, especially among the foreign populate 

The need of better school officers is also a prominent one.

FRONTIER COUNTY 

Frontier county has one hundred seven entire and two fractional

three of them new this fall. There are still ten sod nrninri 
houses in the county. A few of these are very poor, bat most 
of them with our one log school house are neat and comfortable. 
The average size of our districts is nine square miles, 
the largest containing twenty-four sections. District indebtedness 
is rapidly decreasing, while the average length of

steadily advancing.™ The average school levied is twenty 
and four-tenths mills. 

Three districts last year availed themselves of the law permitting 
them to contract with neighboring districts and found 
the plan a success financially and otherwise. Other districts 
might do so with profit, for we have a number of very small 
schools, hut the difficulty of sending small children long 
distances to school seems an insuperable obstacle. Free transportation 
has not been deemed practicable under existing 

We have found it very difficult to supply) our schools with 
teachers this fall. Of the one hundred twenty-three who 
taught in this county last year, thirteen have moved away, ten 
are attending college or normal school, sixteen are farmers or 
farmers' wives and have no time for teaching this year, matrimony 
has robbed us of six, seven were from other counties 
and have returned to them, and ten have quit teaching or 
secured schools elsewhere. 

In order to supply the places of so many, it has been necessary 
to bring in about twenty teachers from abroad. Most of 
these teachers have had considerable experience in school 
work and come well recommended. We trust this new element 
in oar teaching force will prove a source of inspiration and 
strength." We have also found it necessary to issue about 
twenty third grade certificates. Some of the grades are low, 
bat the standard of grading has been rigidly maintained. 

During the past year about two-thirds of our teachers did the 
work of ;the Reading Circle course. The better class of 
teachers do this work from year to year and find it pleasant 
and profitable, but^here, as elsewhere, those whose need of 
every available help "is greatest are the ones who prove careiless 
and indifferent. 

The union institutes at Holdrege and Culbertson were'attended 
by about sixty of our teachers, all of whom speak in the 
highest terms of the character of the work done and the 
advantages of the | plan. A later institute of one week was 
held in this county with an attendance of forty. The instruction 
given 'was very practical \ and carefully adapted to the 
[needs of those present. </seg>

Last spring eleven days were spent in conducting eighth 
grade examinations in various parts of the county. Ninetysix 
pupils took all or part of this examination and thirtv four 
completed the work satisfactorily and received certificate* of 
attainment. The good results of the similar examination bald 
a year previous were apparent in many ways. There is a 
marked improvement in attendance and interest in school on 
the part of older pupils all over the county. It is to the work 
along this line that we attribute chiefly the change in sentiment 
in regard to the free high school attendance law. Last 
year the vote was light, and stood about ten to one against the 
proposition, very few districts regarding it with favor. This 
year nearly all of the districts voted on the question, nineteen 
districts voted favorably and the vote of the entire county was 
only about two to one against the plan. 

A convention of district officers was held in March. The 
county was quite generally represented and a good degree of 
interest was manifest. A permanent organization was effected, 
the State Course of Study was adopted, county uniformity of 
text books was agreed upon and plans matured for a county 
pupils' traveling library. 

The new text books are being rapidly introduced, and twelve 
sections of the library are already in use. 

fur county is large and the work presents many difficulties; 
the people are progressive in spirit, and earnestly desire 
best possible educational privileges for their children.

GRANT COUNTY 

Erbnt county is centrally located in the sand hills country, 
parsely settled and the only industry is cattle raising. At 
&gt; time there are only six organized school districts, each 
taining thirty-six square miles. A large maiority of the 
chmen live in Hyannis and Whitman so that their children 
attend school. The county financially is in a prosperous 
dition and nearly all school districts have surplus funds 
[ pay teachers promptly. 

K'he Hyannis school is under the supervision of C. E. Hill, 
isted by Miss Mabel Ford intermediate, and Miss Lulu

supervision of Mr. and Mrs. A. P. Smith for the third year. 
Both schools are doing good work. The Hyannis school has 
been the making of the town. Mrs. Jennie Sheldon, a ranchman's 
wife and teacher of District No. 6, with her children 
makes daily a drive of five miles to school and back home, one 
thousand eight hundred miles for the nine months' term. 
Whitman has a new two story school house and Hyannis is 
now building a new brick building modeled after the Calhoun 
school house with some modifications. In making my rounds 
among the schools I find that not all school teachers are 
teachers ; all are anxious to succeed in their work but some 
fail and they cannot understand why it is. If those teachers 
could have the encouragement of the patrons and school 
officers they might possibly succeed. Taking everything into 
consideration the teachers of Grant county are doing a noble 
•work. H. R. Dellinger. 

GREELEY COUNTY 

During the past two years there have been built in this 
county seven large, comfortable frame school houses; these 
were all built by country districts. We now have fifty-eight 
districts in the county containing sixty-one frame school 
buildings and one brick building. There are no sod school 
houses in Greeley county. 

I tie corps of teachers employed by the school boards are 
less enthusiastic than tne patrons. They are an earnest 
? of workers and will give, I believe, value received for 
wages paid them. No better proof of the professional inst 
taken by teachers can be given than their prompt and 
ing attendance at our annual institute which convened 
;ust 18 and continued in session for one week. There 
8 seventy-five teachers enrolled. A record of attendance 
kept and all loss of time through absence or tardiness 
»d ; at the close of the institute the per cent of attendance 
found to be ninety-six and seven-tenths. The institute 
conducted along the line of professional work rather than

which holds monthly meetings. Every teacher in the county 
belongs to one of the local circles and has purchased the books 
adopted by the state board. Almost every teacher is a reader 
of The Nebraska Teacher and one or more other educational 
papers. 

Each teacher of the county has a copy of the State Course 
of Study and I have asked all to become perfectly familiar 
with it, and follow it as closely as possible in grading their 
schools. 

It is to the credit of the teachers of the county that twothirds 
of our district schools have school libraries. The 
teachers have labored for this and their efforts are eminently 
successful. Many districts at the annual meeting laid aside a 
certain sum to be expended in augmenting their libraries. 

All our districts furnish text-books to pupils, and nearly 
every school house is well supplied with maps, globes and 
other necessary apparatus. 

Eeachgrs are better paid than they have ever been before 
very few teachers now receive less than $30.00 a month, 
le several country schools pay $40.00 a month. 

We have not yet been abl« to effect an organization of school 
boards of the county, but an effort will be made to perfect an 
organization this winter. I believe much good may be 
accomplished by an organization of this kind. 

D. D. Donovan. 

HALL COUNTY 

The general condition of the schools has not greatly changed 
in any one direction in the last two years. It has been my attempt 
to raise the qualifications of our teachers, and also their 
salaries. This fall found our county short of teachers by 
trteen, and the wages were raised at least three dollars a 
nth on the average. I was compelled to issue half a dozen 
third grade certificates, a thing not practiced in this county 
for ten years. 

Our county seems to have improved. in the professional 
spirit. We now have our county divided into Beading Circle 
districts, one for each town, and each division meets once a 
month. Ninety per cent of our teachers are doing the work 
this year. We meet in general county sessions twice a year. 
This plan of work has only been in force three years. </seg>

            <seg id="p239">

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

I have also introduced the method of giving eighth grade 
examinations and issuing diplomas from this office. Hall 
county had a class of twenty-two in 1901 and fourteen in 1902. 
Many more took part of the work last year and will complete 
it this year. Most of the pupils are going to higher institutions 
of learning. I consider this my most profitable attempt. 

Our buildings generally are good and our school officers 
liberal. Dan H. Fishburn. 

HARLAN COUNTY 

We are located in a comparatively new country, west of that 
line which marks the certainty of bountiful harvests. None 
of our rural population has begun to feel wealthy while past 
crop failures have depopulated our county and decreased our 
assessed valuation quite materially. These conditions have 
had their influence upon the schools, causing shorter terms, 
keeping down teachers' wages and causing districts to use old, 
dilapidated buildings for school purposes, while many schools 
are using text books that were copyrighted thirty years ago, 
and are also without maps, globes, sufficient blackboard, libraries, 
dictionaries and other appliances and conveniences that 
make school teaching and school life congenial and attractive. 

|3t. with all the drawbacks and obstacles we have encouni, 
we are steadily advancing. During the last three years 
new district has been organized and three new schoolses 
built. Two of these replace old, cheaply constructed 
iings. Two villages, Kagan and Huntley, have added a 
a each to their school buildings, and employ two teachers 
aad'of one. Many other buildings have been improved, 
tions and repairs made. Our teachers are enthusiastic as 
rps, and wages are the highest in the history of the 

t)me of the hindrances to the best work which are still in 
way are the constant changing of the corps of teachers, 
short time a teacher is employed in one district, the low 
&gt;rket value" of a teacher's time, the great distance from 
normal school, the number of untrained and immature 
hers we must put into the school rooms in order to supply 
demand for teachers at the price offered, and the number 
ural schools with so few pupils. </seg>

            <seg id="p240">
COUNTY AND CITY SCHOOLS. 

839 

We are trying to overcome these difficulties. As said above, 
our wages have exceeded "high water mark." The Union 
Institute, which has certainly come to stay till a Normal school 
is within our reach, will greatly raise the standard of our 
teaching force. The increased wages, which we think is permanent, 
will help to keep the better teachers in the work. 
One district voted this year to hold no school, but to school 
its pupils in adjoining districts. If this idea becomes contagious, 
as we hope it will, we will be able to reduce the number 
of small schools and the number of teachers required in 
the county. 

Our districts are practically all out of debt. Not one discounts 
its warrants. For this state of affairs much credit is 
due the county treasurer and board of supervisors. For over 
six years the warrants of the districts have been bought at par 
by the treasurer and held as cash, being paid for with various 
sinking funds in his possession. These warrants were held 
until funds accumulated to the credit of the district, drawing 
them when they were returned to the district in lieu of cash, 
and without interest. One can readily see the benefit of such 
a practice. It kept the warrants at par, thereby saving much 
to the teachers; it allowed districts to keep schools going at a 
time when no taxes, or a small part, were being paid, without 
interest accruing, thereby saving much to many districts. 

In the rural schools we are using monthly reports to parents, 
perfect attendance certificates to stimulate regularity and 
punctuality, quarterly examination questions, that all schools 
may soon be graded systematically, and this year we have 
furnished every school with a daily program. These supplies 
have been furnished by the county, the board paying for 
them out of the general fund. The county also allows us $100 
each year for institute fund. 

Last year I began giving the eighth grade examination at 
different accessible points in the county. These were fairly 
well attended, 111 taking the examination. A joint graduating 
exercise was held with Phelps county. I think interest in the 
eighth grades has been considerably aroused, and indications 
are that twice as many will take the eiehth grade examination 
this year. </seg>

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

The graded schools are preparing to do more thorough 
work. One principal will not graduate a pupil who does not 
first pass a first grade examination before me. Acting upon 
this suggestion, I have already made my plans to give the first 
grade examination in each graded school, that the graduating 
class may have the opportunity to take it. I am confident that 
this will very materially raise the standard of the graduates. 

Our Reading Circle work has not been as successful as we 
could wish. Only about fifty per cent of the teachers did 
much work last Year. Indications are that the increase will be 
very marked this year. U. C. Breithaupt. 

HAMILTON COUNTY 

There is a decided advance in teachers' wages since a year 
ago. The average wage of the female teacher in 1901-'02 was 
?31.75; in 18O2-'O3 it is $39.81. The average wage of male 
teachers in 1901-'02 was $35.95; in 1902-'03 it is $46.28. No 
male teacher receives less than $35 a month. A few female 
teachers are teaching for the paltry sum of $25 a month. 

Ki the many calls to send teachers to the districts of our 
nty, the universal sentiment is "We would like a capable, 
erienced teacher and are willing to pay good wages." 

few and up-to-date texts are taking the place of the texts of 
"antique" stamp. Some school officers atill use the "theygood-enough-because-they-are-the-kind-I-used" 
argument. 

Ifost of the schools have at least the beginning of a library, 
eady we begin to feel the growth of an enthusiastic interest 
Eavor of more and better school libraries. The teachers 
mselves have organized a "Teachers' Library Association" 
the purpose of "having accessible to its members the best 
rks on educational topics and best reference books and helps 
teaching; for having at their command the best standard 
rks for general culture." The first purchase consisted of 
&gt; hundred twenty-five well selected volumes The associaa 
is kept up and new books purchased by the payment of 
enrollment fee of one dollar and an annual fee of fifty cents. 

In few, if any, counties in the state does the Teachers' 
Reading Circle work meet with heartier support. The work 
is being done by practically every teacher in the county and 
by several who expect to be teachers in the near future. The </seg>

Course of Study for the county includes a careful outline and 
study of "Hodge's Nature Study and Life" and the reading of 
any three of the remaining books recommended by the Nebraska 
Beading Circle Board. To minimize the cost to each 
teacher, three sets of each of these books are placed in the 
Teachers' Library. Local meetings are held each month at 
seven points in the county. Two general meetings are held 
each year The work of each month is outlined and placed in 
the hands of each teacher. 

Eince January 1, 1902, forty pupils have taken the eighth 
le examination. Twenty have received common school 
omas. Nearly all of those who received diplomas are now 
ome high school. One is now a teacher in the county. 

I'ew schoolhouses have been built in the past two years. 
3 sentiment seems to be in favor of modern, up-to-date 
ldings and furnishings. District No. 51 has built a school 
ise after the plan of the Sutherland schoolhouse, mentioned 
'School Buildings and Grounds in Nebraska." This is the 
t rural school building in the county. 

The annual report from Hamilton county will prove the advantage 
of the large district over the smaller. We have too 
many three and four section districts. The larger district has 
a longer term, levies less tax and pays its teachers better 
wages as a rule. 

We need a free attendance high school law that will be constitutional. 
The present measure has been overwhelmingly 
defeated twice, in spite of the efforts of superintendent and 
teachers to have it become a law. With but one high school 
that could meet the requirements, and many districts voting 
the limit now, it is a difficult matter to convince the people 
that the present measure should become a law.

HAYES COUNTY 

Ehe educational spirit of Hayes county is in a most wholeie 
condition. The people respond liberally to the needs of 
schools, and the school boards are awake to the necessity 
securing the best teachers regardless of price. Each

chool graded to conform to it as closely as possible. </seg>

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

There are so many lines of work which need the attention of 
the county superintendent that it seemed best to concentrate 
effort on what appeared the most important, and through them 
to reach the other ends aimed at. As the results in our schools 
depend upon the teachers who have charge of them, the 
greatest effort during the past three years has been to raise 
the standard of the teaching force. 

Ktie means used were The Institute ; Reading Circle Work ; 
nty Associations; and by visitation. 

As we are in one of the unfortunate counties that have no 
high school, we very naturally look to the institute for the 
needed help. This help we failed to receive in our two weeks' 
institute as the instructors were unable to do much along an 
academic line in so short a time. 

I here being no normal school within reach of the teachers 
south-west Nebraska, we did the next best thing, in our 
nion, that could be done, and formed a Union Normal Inute 
at Culbertson, consisting of Chase, Hayes, Hitchcock, 
i Willow, and Frontier counties. The result of this was 
and more than we expected it could be. It met with some 
favor at first but we succeeded in getting thirty-three of 
forty-five teachers in this county to attend, and we are 
•ing immediate results. In all the schools I have visited 
is far teachers are doing much better work in primary read; 
and language. They have an end in view and seem to 
rk from principle rather than form. 

The teachers' associations in this county are not what they 
should be but the interest is increasing and there is a promise 
of better things for the future. 

Consolidation of school districts is one of the most important 
questions in this county. Districts are small and should be 
very much larger so they can maintain more school and pay 
better wages, thereby securing a better teaching force. There 
has been some work done along this line, during the past 
year. The districts have decreased from seventy-one to sixty, 
but forty is enough for this county. 

I The districts are in a better financial condition than they 
ive been for some time, only a few districts having to distunt 
their warrants. </seg>

            <seg id="p244">

El school houses are gradually giving way to the more 
aodious frame buildings : more months of school have been 
I, and teacher's wages are much better on account of the 
cial conditions. 

Eie demand for better teachers is increasing as is also the 
jsition to pay better wages. The teachers are meeting 
demand by special preparation. Some have attended our 
nal schools. 

the prospect for Hayes county is quite bright for the future, 
I am sure that]with the same energy on the part of the 
:hers in the future as in the past, constant progress .will 
nade. G. H. Pickett. 

HITCHCOCK COUNTY 

The general educational condition in Hitchcock county is 
favorable. All the schools are supplied with teachers; the 
average length of term six and one-half months, one month 
longer than last year; the average salary about £29.50 a 
month, about $2.00 higher than last year. 

The teachers are organized in four sections for Reading 
Circle and other work. A movement is under 
way to effect a county organization of school district officers 
to hold annual meetings and to secure uniformity and a local 
supply agency of text books. The training of the Union 
Normal Institute is producing good results. 

Jas. O'Connell. 

HOWARD COUNTY 

E'here is a general improvement all along the line in the 
al schools of Howard county. A better school sentiment 
vails, not only among the school officers and teachers, but 
jng the patrons and friends'of education. 

A better grade of teachers is demanded and salaries have advanced 
in proportion. 

The scarcity of well equipped teachers and the lack of a 
general school sentiment has interfered somewhat with the 
advancement of our schools. While we hope that this defect 
may be overcome yet we hardly expect a radical change.

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

JEFFERSON COUNTY 

E'he public schools of Jefferson county are in a progressive 
dition, but the discouragements and difficulties common to 
er sections of the state are not unknown to us. 

A few untrained, inexperienced teachers, two or three "fossils," 
and a host of competent, progressive teachers constitute 
our teaching force; and the proverbial "small schools," a few 
large congested ones and a goodly number of a reasonable size, 
all made up of bright, healthy boys and girls, in comfortable 
frame buildings, well supplied with text books and other necessary 
equipments, are the material upon and through which 
this combined force acts. 

Our schools are all following the Nebraska State Course of 
Study, and the grades and classes are generally so combined 
as to reduce the daily recitations to a reasonable number. 

Just one-third of our teachers are in the same positions held 
by them last "year. The heavy demand for teachers in other 
parts of the state took a number of teachers who were among 
the most successful we had. 

Seventeen and one-half per cent of our teachers are beginners. 

A five weeks' Summer Normal School held in Fairbury had 
an enrollment of sixty-nine. 

The Reading Circle work is carefully and systematically 
done by practically all the teachers in the county. 

The school district officers are generally interested in educational 
work and show a willingness to co-operate with teachers 
and superintendent in anything that tends to increase the efficiency 
of our schools. A meeting for the organization of a 
school officers' association was largely attended and a permanent 
organization was effected. A list of text books was 
adopted for use in the county. 

Much interest is manifested by patrons and pupils in the 
Eighth Grade county examination and graduation. One 
hundred fifty-eight pupils were examined by the county superintendent 
at the close of the last term, of which number seventy 
passed successfully and received common school diplomas. 
Public graduations were held in different parts of the county

JOHNSON COUNTY 

The educational affairs of Johnson county are is ezoalltaA 
shape. The patrons of our schools are exacting in their demands 
for the best possible work on the pert of the feasts. 
They also believe that "the laborer is worthy of his bin," sad 
are consequently paying better wages and providing liberally 
all necessary apparatus for carrying forward the work of tbe&gt; 
schools. 

The teachers are meeting this demand in a moat imiiiwml 
able spirit. The teachers are studying the fundamental prtaciples 
of education as never before. They are alive to everything 
that tends to better themselves for the work of their 
profession. They ""are studying and "linking, not merely 

fetter pay and better preparation on the part of teacher* 
doing much toward bettering the work in oar tflhtmia. We 
thankful that we have but few novices and still fewer foain 
our teaching force. 

In planning the work of our annual Teachers' Institute, w« 
have deviated much from the "old beaten track." Men sod 
women of much training, observation and experience have 
been employed as instructors. The work of the lnstltats has 
consisted largely in discussing the j/rinciple* upon which all 
good teaching rests. The result has been very satisfactory — 
the teachers expressing themselves as being well pleased wMft)

fification and gradation in the schools. Graduating exerare

have completed the work usually done in the rural school. 

While much remains to be done, yet we think much has 
already been accomplished, and the prospect is bright. 

R. F. Adkins. 

KEARNEY COUNTY 

We note three important reasons for the steady progress 
our schools are making : 

school officers are much more united and interested 
e performance of their official duties. 

¦2. A much greater professional spirit and interest is mani 
tested by our teachers. 

3. Our schools are rapidly adopting all measures which 
lead to a healthy educational development. 

Krith these conditions existing we feel comparatively safe 
predicting rapid progress for the future. It is" true we 
;t with many discouragements, but they usually serve to 
aulate us to greater efforts. 

Iir eighth grade examination resulted in the "passing " of 
six pupils out of the fifty-four examined. There were 
sral reasons for this, but we attribute the result chiefly to 
pupils' not having thoroughly completed lower grades betaking 
up eighth grade work. There has been too much 
tendency to promote pupils to a higher grade because of 
r efficiency in two or three of the leading branches while 
j w&lt;)re sadly deficient in the other branches belonging to 
s grade. The new State Course has now been adopted by 
county, and we hope to make use of it "with a vengeance" 
we are anticipating much better results at the close of 
i year. 

IV. very marked improvement in the condition of school 
ildings is being evinced and more attention is being given 
the use of hygienic measures in our schools.

P progress of their pupils. Certificates of Attendance 
issued and with good result*. We make use of the 
[y tests as published by Superintendent Adkins. The 
papers are kept on file by the teacher and they are •#&gt; 
by the county superintendent on his nit*. 

Iur teaching force is somewhat limited and we found it 
sssary to import twelve teachers for our rural school* this 
*. Our teachers are characterized with a most piogl— 
spirit, manifested by the active interest which they show 
ur annual institutes and in their professional work. As 
ding Circle work for this year our teachers are now making 
udy of Hodge's "Nature Study and Life", and at the comion 
of this, will take up Bailey's "Principles of Airrical:". 
Examination is given upon the Reading *ork 
tie close of each school year which is one of the re&gt;i 
its for a teacher's license for the following year. 

Our school officers have succeeded in effecting a permanent 
organization this year, and we anticipate from the interest 
already manifested that much will come from this unification 
in educational interests. This body adopted the new Coons 
of Study and a uniform system of text- books for the county.

KEITH COUNTY 

The educational condition of Keith county is not all that we 
hoped to have it, yet on the whole progress has bean made 
along various lines. 

For the past three years we have had a summer school of six 
weeks, followed by one week of institute, holding oar examinations 
at the close of summer school and before the institute. 
We have found this plan a source of considerable 
benefit to our teaching force. We would welcome a good 
Normal School in Western Nebraska but since we do not have 
one, we have provided the best substitute we could, ff— j 
of our teachers have advanced both in scholarship and professional 
standing through summer school work. 

Frum the first we have recognized the importance of th* 
State Reading Circle course, and each year have endeavored 
to do some work along that line. It has not always been entirely 
satisfactory owing to our county being sparsely settled, </seg>

            <seg id="p251">

making it very inconvenient for many of the country teachers 
to attend. This year more books have been purchased and 
the outlook is brighter for better, more systematic work being 
done than any previous year. 

The gradation of the countrv schools has been another difficult 
problem in this county. Every teacher is given a course 
of study with instructions to follow it closely. We use 
quarterly review questions and eighth grade examinations. 
We are making an effort to have the work more uniform 
throughout the county. 

tThe financial condition of our districts is improving which 
ts the effect of lengthening the terms of school and increasg 
the salary of the teachers. 

The majority of our country schools are quite small. Last 
year in forty-three districts there were ten that had an enrollment 
of less than five, seventeen that had an enrollment of less 
than ten and more than four, making an average of six and 
a fraction in twenty-seven districts. Owing to these conditions 
we have been advocating consolidation, closing the 
school in one district and transporting to another when practicable. 
Our efforts in this line have been successful in 
several districts. The plan is giving satisfaction where tried 
and we hope for greater things in the matter of consolidation 
and transportation. Since the six mile limit has been removed 
several districts in this county have been enlarged . This has 
been especially 'beneficial to districts in the sand hill country 
where the valuation of land is quite low. It has increased the 
valuation of a number of districts thereby giving them a longer 
term and better schools. Wesley Tressler. 

KEYA PAHA COUNTY 

The people of Keya Paha believe in education and have 
faith in their children and in the future. For the last sixteen 
years they hare gone to the limit in levying taxes for the 
support of the schools. One district came into court on their 
own account and confessed judgment in favor of outstanding 
warrants in order that a judgment tax might be levied against 
them and thus in a short time place them on a cash basis. The 
great drawback to our schools, however, is the lack of a High 
school. An effort was made last year to combine and organ- </seg>

situation we failed. In spite of this disappointment we prepared 
to do high school work, ard up to the present the work 
has been very successful and very satisfactory. Our institute 
was well attended and "The way to present the subject to

LANCASTER COUNTY 

The personnel of the teachers of Lancaster county is considerably 
in advance of previous years in college and normal 
training and experience. A few beginners secure schools each 
year, but fortunately they are young people, who move '"in 
touch" with the times and make excellent professional advancement. 


Eur school officers, as a class, evince an active and int*-llib 
interest in public education and appear capable, trustthy 
and willing. 

I^he twenty-seventh annual Teachers' Institute was a splensuccess 
and remarkable for the interest and enthusiasm 
nifested. Almost three hundred teachers were in attendee, 
a number from other counties joining us for the benefit 
work under specialists. Only specialists have been en?ad 
to work in our institutes in recent years. It has been 
i aim to make the institute, in the main, a school of methods 
her than a school of instruction in the subject matter of the 
inches taught in our schools. We prefer to have a few subts 
well presented instead of giving a mere smattering of 
ny subjects. 

The report card system, whicn has been in use in this county 
for several years, together with the quarterly examinations prepared 
by the county superintendent, and the final eighth gr*de 
examinations under the supervision of the superintendent, 
have proved to be of inestimable value as incentives to work 
on the part of pupils. The report card, a combination of 
monthly report and promotion card, is designed, in part, to </seg>

serve as a means of communication between the teacher and 
parent. By examining it each month as it is presented by the 
child, parents are enabled to know what their child's class 
standing and deportment are for a stated period. If grades 
are not satisfactory, parents are urged to meet the teacher at 
the first opportunity for a personal interview. At the close of 
school the report cards are presented to the pupils as a complete 
record of the year's work, the attached promotion card 
being filled out, if the pupil is recommended for promotion. 

All teachers are supplied with the revised State Course of 
Study and the quarterly examinations sent out from the superintendent's 
office are based upon the outlines and suggestions 
in said course. Teachers find the new Course of Study and 
Teachers' Manual a decided improvement on the old one, and 
old and young teachers alike are deriving much benefit from a 
careful study of it. 

About one hundred fifty eighth grade pupils of the rural 
schools take, each year, the final examinations given under 
the direction of the county superintendent. To accommodate 
all, arrangements are made to have committees conduct 
the examinations in those districts where it is most convenient 
for the children to attend. Teachers are asked to certify 
grades in reading, writing, drawing and spelling, and a written 
examination is required in arithmetic, grammar, geography, 
history and physiology. If the examination in the 
above subjects is satisfactory, a high school certificate is issued 
to the pupil. Those pupils who pass, in addition to the above 
subjects, a satisfactory examination in elementary civics are 
awarded a county diploma. In some parts of the county pleasing 
closing exercises are conducted, something in the nature 
of commencement programs. 

A large number of districts during the last two years have 
either established new school libraries or made additions to 
those they already have. In most cases the libraries are made 
up of a splenaid catalogue of graded books. 

E'he publication entitled "School Buildings and Grounds in 
jraska," published by the State Department of Public Iniction 
last April, will certainly stimulate school officers to

eight times a year. The morning sessions are devoted to the

LINCOLN COUNTY 

The educational spirit of Lincoln county is in a most whole 
some condition. I find the people in general giving special 
attention to school matters, and the officers liberal in supplying 
needed equipments for scnool work. 

Only eleven districts of this county have a bonded debt, 
while the floating indebtedness of the districts was reduced 
from 112,604 to $4,281 during the past year. As a result, this 
county is having longer terms of school and an increase of 
teacher &gt;" wages over last year. 

During the past year the number of our districts decreased 
from 113 to 110. We have a few districts containing from nine 
to sixteen sections of land and with an assessed valuation of 
from $1,736 to $2,008, that cannot maintain more than threat 
months of school a year. Our efforts the coming year for the 
smaller districts will be concentrated along the line of consolidation. 
A number this year are taking advantage of the law 
which enables them to contract with a neighboring district. 

We have a school population of 3,960 and had an enrollment 
last year of 3,313 with an average daily attendance of - 
Of the 146 teachers required in this county, 123 are employed 
in the village and country schools. We have five villas*

work, and Hershey, Brady, Maxwell and Welltteet, with two 
teachers each, doing nine grades of work.

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

For the two years past, eighty per cent of our teachers have 
attended school during the summer, preparing themselves for 
their important duties. A Summer School for. teachers and 
prospective teachers has been held each year in North Platte, 
the enrollment being respectively seventy-six and seventy-two 
students. Our Institute convened at the close of our Summer 
School, and was conducted along professional lines. 

E&gt;ur teachers are earnest and industrious, and by their 
ive and progressive spirit made this Institute, both in point 
nterest and attendance, one of the best ever held in the 
nty. 

Ehis year we are using a uniform system of report cards 
Certificates of Perfect Attendance, which we hope will 
itly increase the attendance of the pupils. 

Our teachers are alive to the importance of the Teachers' 
Heading Circle; about seventy-five per cent of the teachers 
are enrolled as members. 

We look hopefully to a successful year's work.

MADISON COUNTY 

Iontinuous and persistent effort has been p at forth to imve 
the quality of the teaching force for rural schools. 
iginners" in the seventy-three rural schools have been as 
ows: 1898,- twenty-two; 1899, twenty-four; ',1900, twenty-nine; 
L, eighteen; 1902, twenty-two. Believing that the teacher 
tie most important factor in the school and noting that 
ut one-third of the force are raw recruits annually, I have 
sted that something be done somewhere by someone to 
&gt;etter in some degree this laree number of young people 
the important work of teaching. 

Most new teachers are high school graduates, and five years 
ago few of them were able to pass for third grade certificates, 
and yet because of lack of better material, we were forced 
place many of them in the schools. 

i?hese conditions were presented to the high school authoris, 
with the result that the of study were in most

encouraged to read works on school management. The graduates 
of most high schools show a marked improvemer. 
scholarship in the common branches, and those who have read 
literature on teaching are doing very creditable work tbeir 
first year as teachers. This together with our Reading Circle 
work and teachers' monthly meetings has brought the quality 
of our teaching force, we believe, considerably above tbe 
average of the state. What has been accomplished in this 
line has been done by the cooperative effort of tbe hitch 
schools with this office, and the good results of this effort are 
becoming more perceptible every year. 

I hat our rural teaching force is capable of doing good work 
ot evidence in the eighth grade examinations, which we bare 
ducted in person for the last four years. These examinins 
show a gradual improvement in tbe scholarship of 
ntr.y pupils. In the first examination they averaged lower 
n most high schools. In the last they have a better average 
n two high schools, are equal to one and one lower than two. 
e hundred three pupils have been examined, one hundred 
nty-nine of whom were country pupils, thirty-two of these 
now in high schools in this county, attending under tbe 
inct district law which went into effect in this county last 

Eost schools are well supplied with maps, dictionaries, text 
cs etc. About twenty districts have supplied two set* of 
ers. About one half 'of the rural schools have small 
tries placed during the last year. 

Teachers' salaries have increased on an average something 
over five dollars a month during the past five years. Then 
twenty -one rural districts paid 125.00 or less a month, and onlj 
one paid more than $35.00. Now "only one pays 125.00 and 
several pay $40.00 or "more. This improvement has beam 
effected by the policy of sifting out the weaker applicants for 
certificates and issuing only enough certificates to barely 
supply the demand, and by urging the boards annually to do 
better by the teachers.

this county. The ruling of the state department has </seg>

fthe effect of practically nullifying the law in one-third of 
districts of the county, and weakening it in all others. 

Certificates of perfect attendance are used to stimulate attendance 
in rural schools. 

Our reading circle plan this year is as follows: Each teacher 
pays in $1.00 with which a certain number of different reading 
circle books and others are purchased. These books are distributed 
to the teachers, who hold them a month or two and 
then exchange for another book. Thus each teacher may read 
eight books at an expense of one dollar and have one book at 
the end of the year. A record is kept of all reading and 
changes in this office. 

While we feel that much has been done the past five years to 
improve school conditions, and that much is better in many 
ways, still we realize that there is much yet to be desired 
which will require years of patient effort to bring into reality. 

We have in prospect a School Board Association, and a 
school newspaper. C. W. Crum. 

MERRICK OOUNTY 

During the past two years, a special effort has been made to 
create a professional spirit among our teachers. The plan has 
been to have local Beading Circle organizations in each town 
of the county and four county Associations each year. Smallpox 
interfered considerably with the Reading Circle work 
last year, but our Associations were quite well attended. 
The papers read seemed to create considerable enthusiasm and 
a general good feeling always prevailed. 

Eeachers who manifested the proper spirit, and whose atlance 
warranted, were given Professional Interest Certifi;s, 
entitling them to a renewal of certificates without exnation. 
Those who fell by the wayside were required to 
s the examination. 

Etie teachers were promised at each Institute that if they 
Id do their part, the superintendent would do all in his 
er to keep down a large surplus of teachers, and endeavor 
jcure for teachers better salaries.

MERRICK COUNTY 

I think of no particular feature of educational condition 
this county worthy of special mention or commendation. In a 
general way the movement here ought, and probably does, 
compare favorably with that of the average county in Nebraska. 
But a strict adherence to conscientiousness oa my 
part causes me to write as follows : 

In reference to teachers' organizations, I will not say that 
¦ meetings are "very interesting"; or that they are remark - 
e because of "great enthusiasm". Such is not tb»&gt; case. 
ey are only ordinary, just such as most others turn out to be 
en the watered reports of them are fathomed. Teachers 
k upon their attendance very much as they would upon any 
[uired duty. But this does not reflect solely upon the 
chers of this county. It is so everywhere. The fact that 
ire is such universal anxiety in educational circles as to 
ether an appropriate amount of enthusiasm was in evidence </seg>

            <seg id="p259">
856 


at a given meeting is good proof that this is the touchy point. 
It is certainly one that is fearfully liable to be absent. So 
we as a class make a careful effort to cover a salient weakness. 
And I am not applying this criticism to my own county alone. 
Other counties must have evinced the same conditions, and 
other superintendents must be driven with me to the same 
old question: Why this defect, and why is it always 
anticipated ? 

(i there no body to teaching? Do a large proportion of our 
hers look upon it as a makeshift "for the present?" 
ching proper, as a life work, has not had a full quota of 
world's great intellects. Many of them miy have taught 
a time but they soon went on beyond. 

And what credit is there for our profession in saying that 
"he was a teacher in early life?" 

How singular it is, yet how significant, that the idea of 
teaching is so inseparably associated with youthfulness and 
immaturity! The public demands age and dignity and profoundness 
of wisdom and experience in law and medicine and 
statesmanship, but they want the cut and dash of youth and 
vivacity when it comes to the selection of a teacher. We find 
only the older boys and girls teaching in the rural schools: 
and in the towns and cities the principals are leaving at middle 
age in order to make'room for the fresh young graduate, or to 
meet some political, religious, or other demand of the Board 
of Education. The silvered head of experience is not wanted 
there. There are whims to gratify, sentiments to be remembered, 
"pulls" to honor. 

IiVhile looking over the field here, I am constrained to ask, 
there depth to teaching? Is it really a "profession" — inpendent, 
strong, and the result of great preparation? The 
blic does not think so. Perhaps we are somewhat to blame 
1 suggesting such an opinion. 

They see us teaching this and that in this way and that way, 
and wildly chasing every phantom of a "new" text, or 
method, or device. These rapid changes of front are not so 
noticeably evident in other professions. Why, then, in oure, 
are there so few things immutable, and so many things 
changeable? </seg>

One reason is that the teacher must be constantly eogni— I 
of the whims and flitful notions of the youthful mind. Her 
occupation is this and that during all the time engaged. She 
must think with all these various changes. Her work and 
associations have their effect. No wonder she enjoys the 
sensation of change, and no wonder she learns to crave something 
new — "a fad". 

Teachers who spend full time with classes and children 
are seldom close analytical thinkers. 

Another reason for our frequent changes and in no vat ions is 
that there are too many young minds engaged in teaching. 
They have not reached that period in life when they do conservative 
and logical thinking. 

Eben is there here a hint that most of our teachers bocoase 
hers too soon? 

Ehis brings us home to another every day problem. Rooghly 
ing it, I may say that the public has an idea that almost 
person can get a certificate. 

I We are all doing wrong in permitting such legal conditions 
exist as would to any degree justify the entertainment of 
;h a thought. 

I'eachers should be required to attend a state normal, or 
ae school endorsed by state authority, for at least two years. 
jbaoly it should be three. Make the teachers' preparation 
long, as exacting, as arduous, as that for the law or 
dicine. Theywould afterward be "admitted" to memberp 
in the state force of teachers, and we would then have no 
ty county superintendents to conduct these petty little 
nthly examinations. In ten years we would hav« schools in 
mine, teachers genuine, and a public that knew where it 

Yes, there are problems in Merrick, as well as every where 
else. But I like my teachers. They are doing well, and doing 
the best they can. Yet I think they will join with me la 
the thought that our educational products are only usual, permissible 
here because similar ones are permissible everywhere, 
but still, in our estimation, they do not stand equal </seg>

NUCKOLLS COUNTY 

I he schools of Nuckolls county seem to be making gradual 
*ress. It would seem now that the greatest obstacle, that 
imlessness in school work, has been overcome by establisha 
course of study. This has imbued the schools with new 
and spirit and they see something more in educational 
ileges than pastime. They are built up in the idea of coming 
the eighth grade course and receiving their diplomas. 
» two years ago when a course of study was first attempted 
le county, the gain in the number of graduates has almost 

There is a far better outlook for progress the coming year 
than has existed in the past. Teachers are assured of the suc-0668 
which a course of study properly applied will give, and 
school officers and parents are learning its force and influence. 
Light is gradually dawning upon them that systematic work 
and encouragement are essential elements of success in the 
schoolroom. 

Possibly there was no one move along educational lines last 
year that did more good than that of holding graduating exercises 
in different parts of the county, mostly in country districts 
and small towns. These gatherings brought the plan of 
school work face to face with officers and parents, acquainting 
them with the results. It is believed, therefore, that the seed 
time was favorable and that there will be a more bountiful 
harvest in the schoolroom this year. 

Nuckolls county claims to be the pioneer, so to speak, in the 
organization of county school board associations. It organized 
in August, 1901, and has grown in favor and firm support since 
that time. It has held two meetings since it came into existence 
and has transacted much important business, which 
has done grand good work for the schools. It has proven to 
be the superintendent's best business medium and its recommendations 
and adoptions give great weight and influence to 
school work. 

The graded schools of the county are up to a high standard 
of success and our townspeople seem to guard their progress 
and interests with great care. Last year three high school 
districts were organized, viz: Hardy, Ruskin and Lawrence. 
Superior, under city organization, has one of the best equipped </seg>

laboratories in the state, and Nelson, being centrally located, 
enjoys a very large non-resident attendance of rural pupils. 

The School Messenger, which is the mouthpiec* soperintendent 
and the official organ of the srhool board*' and 
teachers' associations, is now in its third volume and is recognized 
as being a strong helper in keeping all school factors and 
forces moving together. 

Teachers are taking hold of Reading Circle work in earnest. 
More books have been sold this year than in any two yean 
before. A system of written examinations is conducted instead 
of the usual "round table*' plan, and it i&gt; believed that 
results will be more lasting and the plan conducive to better 
Study. W. T. BOTTENFIELD. 

OTOE COUNTY 

Otoe county has 104 school districts, four of which are fractional 
; 109 schoolhouses, 1 stone, 19 brick and 89 frame, valued 
at $151,940. The total value of school district property is 
$196,921.00. The amount expended by the district treasurers 
for school purposes during the past year was ijK . the 
amount on hand at the close of the year was 1 

During the past year seven new school hous*'* have been 
built in the county, one brick and six frame. Before the opening 
of school this fall a great many of the school buildings in 
the county were repaired and thoroughly cleansed. Teachers 
are receiving from five to fifteen dollars more per month this 
year than last year. 

Our Beading Circle meets once each month at ten different 
places in the county and we are following the work in a goosl 
systematic manner. The teachers are taking great interest hi 
this work. Our teachers' association meets in six different 
places in the county during the year, and is well attended. It 
is a power for good not only for teachers, but also for the 
people of the community in which it is held. 

At the close of our institute the school officers of Otoe county 
were organized, and from present indications this organization 
will be a power in the management of the schools of this 
county in the future. R. C. Kino.

The teachers are also showing commendable interest 
Reading Circle work. 

The "Teachers' Library," in the office of the county superintendent, 
now contains about one thousand volumes. This 
library has been, and is, of much value to the teachers of the 
county. Nearly every school in the county has a library also, 
and the pupils are becoming interested in good reading. These 
libraries were usually started by the teachers and pupils and 
afterwards oft times increased by appropriations by the school 
board. Most of our schools are well equipped. 

Ebout twenty-five pupils passed the examination and seid 
Common School Diplomas last spring, and are now coning 
their education in some High school or Academy. 

At the beginning of the year the teachers were supplied 
with copies of the Course of Study and asked to adhere to it 
as closely as possible in grading their schools. This has been 
done, with the result that we have fewer classes and more 
time for recitation in many of our schools. A general effort 
has been put forth by the teachers and superintendent to increase 
the attendance of our schools and make it more regular. 
A personal letter to parents was issued, calling their attention 
to ways of helping the school, and asking their assistance. 
Enough copies of this letter, together with envelopes, were 
given each teacher to supply every family in the district with 
a copy. This effort, accompanied by the efforts of the teacher, 
has borne good results. The schools of Pawnee county are in 
a progressive condition. J. C. Waddell.

This county has no saloons, no drunkards, no rowdies, no 
loafers, no pool rooms and in fact almost none of the pitfalls 
for young people usually so abundant in the more thickly settled 
portions of the state. 

Iur school districts are large, very large, and constantly 
&gt;ming larger. Yet as a rule our schoolhouses are poor and 
rly equipped, and the schools are small, only averaging about 
it or ten scholars to the school. Some of these scholars

Ester and they seek to do their best. And what a power 
i direction they have been and are at present as they 
silently and cheerfully on. 

I he careful teacher soon learns how important it is to do 
very best and she straightway goes at her task. This is 
ely the secret of her success, and ere she is aware her 
izon widens, her interest deepens, her hold upon her 
•ons grows firmer and her influence becomes a power in 
district and even in the county where she teaches. What

few of our young men, I fear, are found in the ranks as 
hers. I do not think all teachers ought to be men. 
nen have a place as well as men as teachers and they are 
ied, but more men are needed if the best results are to be 
ined. Many of our boys need a man's influence to keep 
a in school and to develop the best that is in them. 

But if more men are to be employed, higher wages must be 
paid. Young men will not choose teaching as a profession so 
long as nearly every other avenue of employment pronvses 
better pay. Many of our lady teachers deserve, and ought to 
have, better pay in order to keep abreast with the demands 
that are made upon them in keeping themselves prepared for

Special stress was laid on the teaching of reading, and progress 
was made in this, yet the status is very low in all grades, 
including the High schools of this county, — though perhaps 
not any lower here than in neighboring counties. Personally 
I regret this condition of affairs in respect to reading, a subject 
of so great importance in the public school course. Stress 
will be laid on this subject this year only with greater emphasis; 
also on the subject of spelling which under our "word" 
method has fallen behind. W. N. Stevenson. 

PLATTE COUNTY 

re two years that have passed since our last report have 
years of prosperity for the schools of Platte county. 

Our school boards are continuing to put into the schools the 
best text books and illustrative apparatus to be obtained ; 
where changes take place in buildings and improvements, the 
old is always supplanted with something better, more in 
harmony with modern ideas. 

E r e find many of our school boards are not only willing, but 
ious to pay good wages to skillful and thoroughly educated 
:hers. We hope this spirit will permeate every district in 
county. Then will teachers have reason to remain in the 
fession, knowing that thorough preparation on their part 
ns something better than mere existence for the future. 

i'he deep chasm which once existed between rural and city 
ools is now scarcely perceptible in the grades. This 
nge has been brought about partly by supervision, quary 
questions, increased attention to classification and adtages 
derived from the state course of study. 

Notwithstanding the adjunct law is not in force, we are 
graduating many pupils from the rural schools, the parents 
willingly paying the tuition demanded by the high schools 
rather than denying their children the advantages of higher 
education. 

Eie law referring to instruction in neighboring districts 
d be used to an advantage in some of our schools. As yet 
are slow to grasp the benefits derived by its use. 

The transfer law is quite popular with us, two hundred 
twenty-eight pupils having been transferred this year. </seg>

            <seg id="p270">

The fruits of the compulsory law are already quite apparent, 
and as a result we have a better general attendance and the 
schools are more valued and respected. 

The moral tone of our schools is improving, Reading Circle 
work is being followed, institutes and teachers' meetings are 
well attended, much interest being manifested; honest and 
thorough work is being done by teachers, pupils and boards 
of education. 

While conditions are generally satisfactory, much remains 
to be done, however, and with the concurrence and help of 
officers, teachers and patrons we will strive for further improvement.

•POLK COUNTY 

The school officers of the county are beginning to think, 
many of them, that school is not merely a financial drain on 
the public purse, but that it i» a duty which every true citizen 
owes to the coming generations. 

We have in our county seventy-one districts, employing 
eighty-eight teachers. Last year there were one hundred 
teachers who taught one or more terms in our county. We 
have sent from this office circular letters to the school officers 
stating the advantages of retaining the same teacher the entire 
year, especially wh^n everything is going so there is no 
cause for a change. 

This year just one-fourth of our present teaching force are 
beginners. While we are glad to welcome any one who feels 
called to direct the minds of our young, yet we realize that 
many times the experience, which every teacher needs in order 
to judiciously manage a school, costs the pupils and the district 
a great deal. 

Quite a strong effort was made last year by many of the 
schools to found libraries, and many succeeded well. There 
are about forty out of the sixty-eight rural schools which have 
libraries ranging from twenty-five to one hundred and fifty 
volumes. Every one of these libraries, with but one or two 
exceptions, has been established through the efforts of the 
pupils and teachers by having entertainments of various kinds, 
the proceeds going to the library fund. 

Last March and June we held the first county eighth grade 
examinations ever held in the county. At the March examina- </seg>

creditable examination. This year we expect to 
number of applicants in this examination, and into 
attend high school. 

At our teachers' meeting last March we framed and adopted 
a constitution, and at the meeting in May completed a permanent 
organization. Our county meetings are held every six 
weeks at Osceola. 

Pae teachers, as a rule, are much interested in the Reading 
le work and are endeavoring to advance in the profession 
working steadily to improve and better fit themselves for 
hing. Many of the teachers after their school closed last 
ng, attended summer school. 

We have three high schools, at Shelby, Osceola and Stromsburg. 
Osceola did much repairing and painting, both inside 
and outside, during the summer vacation; Stromsburg built a 
large two room addition, put in a furnace, and papered and 
painted the interior of the old part. There have been three 
new schoolhouses built in the county and many remodeled and 
painted. 

We held one week of institute this year and it was characterized 
by deep interest and earnest work, with an attendance of 
seventy-three teachers and a strong corps of instructors, and 
interesting lectures. 

Eur county agricultural society awarded, approximately, 
00 to the schools for work exhibited and to decorated vees 
in the parade Children's day. 

Erhile there are many phases of the work that should be 
ught to a higher plane, yet we realize that it is only 
augh constant effort and never tiring energy that the desd 
end is accomplished. D. C. Cole. 

RED WILLOW COUNTY 

It is my belief that the essence of any good school is in the

much progress has been made. The educational spirit was

¦very teacher is supplied with a State Course of Study, 
ch she follows as closely as circumstances will justify. 

That we might decrease the per cent of absence and tardiness, 
we offered to each pupil who was not absent nor tardy 
during the entire term, a "certificate of award." As a result 
the daily records were much improved and almost one hundred 
certificates were issued the first year. 

Our teachers readily comply with the request to buy and 
read educational papers and books. 

Eany of the stronger districts have introduced well selected

or basket socials. 

rhe repeal of the Free High School law was keenly felt by

The conditions that prevail at present in most of the eightythree 
districts of Red Willow county are very satisfactory. 
Parents, pupils and teachers are working in unison to advance 
the interests of education. The results of their efforts are very 
marked ; the general interest of parents is increasing: pupils 
are being more punctual and regular in attendance; teachers 
are making more thorough preparation for and taking a livelier 
interest in their work. 

The Nebraska Course of Study has been adopted by more 
than sixty per cent of the districts; in fact, nearly all of the 
strongest districts have adopted it, and it is in use in most of 
the districts where it has not been made official. A strong 
effort, which is being reasonably successful is being made to 
grade the rural schools. The length of the terms for the year </seg>

is greater than last year with a good advance in teachers' wages. 

Several of the rural schools have well selected and large 
libraries. Many others have small but growing ones, which 
are proving to be very useful to patrons and pupils. A 
number of our teachers have shown very commendable zeal 
and enterprise in devising ways and means to provide money 
to purchase a few books for a library beginning. 

The Teachers' Association has four meetings each year at 
different places in the county at which are discussed questions 
of practical and professional interest. A true educational 
spirit is manifested at these meetings. 

Ehe Union Normal Institute at Culbertson, in which our 
nty took part, proved to be productive of good results. It 
i economical ; afforded a broad course meeting the needs of 
:hers of all grades; it gave to the teachers of the counties 
eerned the service of the best instructors and lecturers.

RICHARDSON COUNTY 

Upon entering the duties of this office in January, ISO"', I 
decided that in order to raise the standard of our schools, I 
must try to raise the standard of the teacher, and since no 
Beading Circle existed in this county, and knowing that my 
predecessors had practically failed in their efforts to establish 
one, I decided^ to attempt the Local Association plan and, 
consequently, divided the county into thirteen districts, 
selected a manager for each district, procured the necessary 
report blanks and records and set the wheels of the local 
association in motion, granting individual credit for work done. 
While these meetings were both beneficial and encouraging, 
there were many weak features in the plan through which 
members could evade any real work and still get credit, so the 
next year I developed a Beading Course for teachers whereby 
they could do their reading at their homes. I sent them questions 
on the amount of the course covered once every two 
months to which they wrote the answers and returned to me 
to be graded and credit to be given to each person as merited 
on his or her future examination for a certificate. 

We tried holding three regular meetings of the County 
Teachers' Association each year besides the annual institute </seg>

meeting, but on account of the State and District associations 
found the number impracticable, and thereafter held but two 
regular meetings each year. The association usually met 
a Friday evening when a lecture by some prominent educator 
was secured and on the following Saturday a general program 
of papers read and discussed. During my term of office 
the association has been fortunate in having sufficient funds 
on hand to secure good advantages. 

During the past four years ninety-three rural ]Jpupils have 
passed the regular examinations and graduated from the eighth 
grade work, receiving diplomas. Some of the schools have 
held quite elaborate graduating exercises while others made no 
particular demonstration. I have always discouraged work in 
the rural schools beyond the eighth grade unless the school 
was small and the higher work could be carried on advantageously 
to some pupils without detriment to others. 

During the first two years of my incumbency, my principal 
efforts were to improve and strengthen the teaching force by 
means of associations, reading courses and more rigid examinations 
; but during the last two years my aim has been to 
hold the good gained during former years and to emphasize 
the State Course of Study, and a more systematic grading and 
classification of our rural schools, and to this end tried to have 
the teachers and school boards to understand more thoroughly 
our present course of study. 

j 

At this time I changed all reports from teachers to this office 
from monthly to quarterly reports, and recorded these reports 
as a record of the teachers' work. I also suggested q uarterly 
examination of pupils for which I sent out from this uffice 
quarterly test questions. During these two years quarterly 
report cards of pupils' work to parents were furnished all 

ty institutes have been parallel in the main to the principal 
ures of my work while in this office. The first two instis 
were more for the advancement of the teachers, and the 
two more for closer and more systematic work in the 
tola, special stress being laid upon the course of study. 

These institutes have been very well attended, yet each year 
some teachers were absent. I have never thought it best to 
drive teachers, but have always tried to lead, never requesting </seg>

a task that I myself was not willing to assume, and have 
always tried to take my part of whatever was to_|do, so I have 
always received the earnest co-operation and assistance of

During my term of office 'five new school houses were built 
but many mure should be built to replace many of the present 
old ones. Of the one hundred four schools in the county about 
one hundred have reported on the following as follows : All 
report patent desks, although five have some wooden ones. 
Forty report slate blackboards, twenty plaster, forty-four 
wooden, and five report some cloth, three some paper, and 
three some hylo-plate. All but three report separate out 
houses and these three report none or practically none. 

Eost all schools are fairly well equipped with apparatus,

RICHARDSON COUNTY 

Of the 104 districts seventy-four owned the text books in 
1900. Now eighty-th ee own the text books. In 1885 uni • 
formity of text books was adopted but it did not last long. 
This year the county superintendent consulted with the leading 
teachers, selected a list of books and s«nt out a circular 
letter advising that they be adopted gradually. Many schools 
have already adopted the list. 

Enirty-five of our schools have libraries, some of which are 
11 but the books are well selected and generally well used. 

The State Course of Study is followed. The work is arranged 
by quarters, teachers report to the county superintendent 
at the close of each quarter. Blanks for these reports 
are furnished by the county, and also pupils' report cards to 
parents. Bach quarter test questions, based on the State 
Course of Study, are sent out by the county superintendent. </seg>

Teacher and nearly every teacher takes the Pathfinder, 
ce every two months the county superintendent sends out 
sstions on the Reading Circle work which are answered and 
urned to be graded. A record of these grades is kept as 
II as a record of each teacher's work in the school, associais, 
and institute. And on these records is based a system 
credits which apply on the teacher's examination for a cer-2ate. 
Actual work is the true criterion of a teacher's ability. 

We have established a Teacher's Professional Library. It 
now consists of 100 volumes. We have ten graded schools in 
our county. These books are divided into ten division libraries. 
The principal of each school is a division librarian and 
has charge of one division library. Each principal conducts 
a Reading Circle Class for the teachers in his vicinity, which 
meets every other Friday evening. 

The Teachers' Association meets twice a year. School officers 
and patrons take part in the program. 

i)ur institutes are usually held in August — one week; they 
partly academic, partly professional. Some new features 
re added this year: An art exhibit, a class in picture study,

Two new brick school houses have been built this year. As

containing six to fifteen children of school age. In these 
already large the people will not listen patiently 
to consolidation of districts. During the past year a number 
of barns have been erected for the benefit of those pupils who 
are compelled to drive horses, that have long since passed 
their eighth birthday, to a schoolhouse four to six miles from 
home. Schools with a small number of pupils don't do as 
good work as schools with a larger number of pupils. This 
state of affairs is gradually getting better as the county becomes 
more thickly settled 

The Reading Circle work is, as yet, only in its infancy. 
Three years ago marked its commencement in this part of the 
state. About ten per cent of the teachers did the work the 
first year; thirty per cent the second year, and this year over 
fifty per cent are doing the work with pleasure and profit. 

Ex school libraries were established last year. The money 
raised by giving public entertainments. So much good 
been derived from these that many new libraries will be 
blished this fall and winter. 

Much attention has been given the matter of grading the 
rural schools. All of the teachers are making an honest effort 
to follow the State Course of Study as closely as local conditions 
will permit. I have required the teachers to send me a 
report showing the amount of work accomplished, and the 
markings received by each pupil at the close of each month's 
work. The object of these monthly reports is to keep more 
closely in touch with both teacher and pupils. Some teachers 
are prone to give their pupils unreasonably hign markings; 
this works much harm to the system of grading. These reports 
give me a good opportunity to call their attention to this 
error. I insist that the final, or term report, be perfectly honest 
and correct. With a correct report left in the classification 
register, the next teacher is enabled to commence intelligent 
work the first day of school. This plan has been quite 
helpful in this county. 

The last Teachers' Institute was the largest in point of numbers 
ever held "in the county. Both academic and professional 
work was done. For the first time a day was set apart as 
School Officers' Day. While not a great success in point of 
attendance, much good was accomplished. </seg>

SALINE COUNTY 

iialine county has 119 school districts, with high schools in 
ht of them. In the high school districts are employed 
ty-one teachers, while two of the rural districts employ two 
chers each. Thus the county, during the school year, emys 
about one hundred seventy-five teachers. Our teachers' 
etings have suffered somewhat owing to the fact of not 
ring a town in the center of the county in which to meet. 

Idealizing that professional qualifications are not only estial 
to insure success, but demanded from them by school 
;ers and patrons alike, there has been a notable increase in 
sndance upon normal schools. The high schools of the

branches taught in our rural schools: and while they art' 
s assisting in furnishing oar schools with better teachers, 
n convinced they are also doing the verj terries to 
ir graduates. 

I'ur teachers are not as well paid as they should be. This 
r there is an advance in wages owing to the scarcity of

SARPY COUNTY 

tt no period in the history of Sarpy county has there been 
iter interest in educational matters than at the present time, 
ool houses are being repaired and yards fenced. The latest 
best textbooks are supplanting the old out-of-date ones, 
ool boards are demanding professionally trained teachers 
teachers of experience. Many districts did not hire 
hers till late in the season because they demanded 
ler qualified teachers than they were able to obt tin. 

Ivery district is supplied with the Nebraska Course of Study 
Teachers' Manual and the rural schools are 'graded as 
ely as is practicable. Quarterly examination questions 
&gt;d on this course are sent out, and final eighth grade examions 
are held in the spring. The eighth grade examination 
held for the first time last spring and the result was quite

as far as practical.

line exists. 

About eighty-eight per cent of our teachers have had at

are graduates from high schools. 

The sentiment for special professional training is growing

SCOTTS BLUFF COUNTY 

Ee schools of Scotts Bluff county have made noticeable imement 
during the last few years in some respects. Two 
I sod houses have given place to four-room brick buildings; 
two others have been replaced by commodious, wellfurnished 
one-room frame; one that was burned was replaced 
by a smaller one, but large enough to make a comfortable 
room ; many others have added improvements in various ways, 
leaving this county, where a few years ago sod houses were 
numerous, with only three sod houses and two of log, which 
will be occupied this year. These districts also contemplate 
building frame houses soon. Others think of building tworoom 
schoolhouses. 

In 1900 there were no country districts with more than a six 
months' term of school, and there was only one village school. 
A number of the districts had three months' terms. Teachers, 
with the exception of two or three, were paid from twentytto 
thirty dollars a month with warrants. This year half 
districts in the county have eight or nine months' terms 
and there are only three with less than a six months' term. 
Most of the districts are paying cash, and only one or two are 
paying less than thirty-five dollars a month. A number are </seg>

rate. 

Teachers with professional training are in the minority. 
Kly about one-third the number employed have had any nor 
1 training. Almost the entire number, so far thin year, have 
been in attendance at the Teachers' Association, where the 
Reading Circle work is taken up. Last year about one-third 
fe in attendance, and I believe previous to that time not 
e than that number took part. A Headin. i was orized 
in the county at least nine years ago, and this work 
been done every year, excepting tv. e that time. 
Last year the meetings were intensely interesting and very 
practical. While the first meetings of this year have not been 
as interesting as last, it is hoped that the increased attendance 
may make it more beneficial. I believe there has been mm 
advancement along the line of professional ability. 

A move has been made this year to grade more closely the 
rural schools and get them in line with the Course of Study. 
Perhaps the schools have retrograded in this respect, as a f&lt;&gt;w 
years ago much attention was paid to this work at in 
etc., and teachers seemed to be using it, but of late only a few 
have made any practical use of it. 

E meeting of school officers was called last year. About 
third of the boards of the county were represented. On 
ant of the small number present, no organization was 
pleted. Thus far there has been no school board organization 
in the county. Agnes Lacki 

SEWARD COUNTY 

The schools of Seward county have undergone no remarkable 
changes daring the past few years. It is nevertheless 
noticeable that along some lines at least we have made considerable 
progress. The wages of teachers, especially in the 
country districts, have grown slightly better each year for 
several years past ; and the average length of the school tana 
has slightly increased. 

The standard of qualifications has been gradually raised, and 
while our teaching force is far from the ideal, and probably 
inferior to that of many counties, yet we have an excellent 
corps. No third grade examinations have been tolerated in </seg>

the county for four years; and the required average for second 
grade papers is eighty per cent, and seventy-five per cent is 
the minimum grade. Many of our teachers are high school 
graduates and a large majority have bad normal training. 
Five county teachers' meetings are held at the county seat 
each year. The attendance is always good and the meetings 
are interesting and helpful. The county is divided into ten 
districts for reading circle work and meetings are held every 
two weeks. Last year more than half of the teachers in the 
county completed the year's work. Much has been accomplished 
in the past two years to improve the attendance and 
punctuality in our schools, and with most gratifying results. 
I think it is safe to say that the unnecessary tardiness and 
absence have been reduced at least fifty per cent. An aroused 
interest on the part of teachers and a system of merit certificates 
have done the work. 

We have fewer graduates from the eighth grade in the rural 
schools than many counties. This is due, in part at least, to 
the fact that a very large per cent of our population is foreign 
or of foreign parentage and the children are too often taken 
out of school and put to work as soon as they are old enough 
to be of service on the farm. 

ftie school officers of the county have an organization and

I have great hope that this may be the most potent

patrons can be reached and through them the pupils. I

is a higher tax levy and better pay for teachers. While the 
teachers are not receiving all they should, the school boards 
have been led to realize that the better teachers must receive 
more pay. Last year the female teachers of our county 
received an average salary of $33.16 per month while the male 
teachers received an average of $46. 48 per month This year 
the average salary will be at least $2.50 per month higher. 
The supply and demand of teachers is such that teachers oan 
demand higher wages. Four of our village schools this year 
have each added an extra teacher, thus enabling them to do 
more thorough and higher work. We expect much good to 
come from our school board organization in the way of better 
equipment such as uniformity of text-books, two sets of 
readers, less waste in buying useless material and better repaired 
school bouses. 

We are also very much enthused by the fact that over 97 
per cent of our teachers are actively engaged in doing regular 
Reading Circle work. However, we see much room for improvement, 
and hope to continue moving onward.

t'he educational spirit is growing in Sheridan county. Many 
tacles that had to be contended with in the past, are being 
luved or overcome by the characteristic pluck, or financial 
rifice of our people. 

Ik. general depression of business made the collection of taxes 
icult, and the lack of funds with school districts brought

¦den of debt, and a general interest is being aroused in 
ication throughout the county. We had two weeks of Nor-1 
combined with two weeks of Institute last Juue. Sixtyht 
teachers were in attendance and all showed intense inest 
in the work throughout the entire session.

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

Of the eighty-eight schools in working order in the county, 
8eventy-five have voted school for this year, the terms ranging 
from three to nine months, rraking an average of five months. 
Despite the fact that wages are forty per cent higher than last 
year, we are unable to find a sufficient number of teachers to 
supply the demand, without importing them. No third grade 
certificates were issued at the close of the institute, but 1 am 
now issuing third grade certificates to beginners, to teach in 
certain districts where circumstances seem to justify the same. 

Our county association is practically divided into three sections, 
but all meet together three times during the school 
year, once at each of the principal towns in the county, viz : 
Hay Springs, Rushville and Gordon. Forty teachers are 
taking the Reading Circle work. Questions on the Reading 
Circle work are to be mailed to each teacher three times during 
the year. Those who write creditable examinations on these 
questions will be given credit for the Reading Circle work. 

I am making an extra effort to revive interest in the teachof 
reading, spelling and mental arithmetic in the country 
ools, as I believe those studies are not receiving as much 
sntion as they should. The state course of study and report 
is are in the hands of every teacher in the county, and we 
trying to conform as nearly as practicable with the state 
rse of study. Grade questions are being sent out to all the 
jhers with the recommendation that they be used at least four 
es during the school year for written examinations, or 
ry second month. 

I he greatest obstacle to the progress of our schools in 
ridan county is the instability of the teaching force. This 
ue, in a great degree, to lack of opportunity on the part of 
young teacher. We are nearly five hundred miles from 
state institution of learning, for the support of which we 
taxed equally with our eastern fellow citizens, and we are 
&gt;e hundred and seventy miles from a private Normal school 
ny note ; which facts make it impracticable for our teachers 
ttend such schools. Our teachers therefore must come 
a the country, or village high school, and realizing their 
: of professional training, "they make no resolution to 
&gt;w teaching as a profession, but simply desire to teach

can make as much or more money, regardless of the choice 
of occupation. I see no wav to remedy th's evil in the western 
part of the state, until our legislature sees fit to recosnize our 
rights by establishing a state Normal school in the western 
part of the state from which our people may secure some of 
the advantages for which they now pay equally with others

The schools of Sherman county are in as good condition as 
could reasonably be expected considering the fact that a large 
number of our districts have been laboring under the disadvantage 
of indebtedness which necessitated issuing time warrants, 
but I am glad to note that during the last four years 
nearly all of this floating indebtedness has been lifted : our rural 
districts have been voting longer terms for the past two or 
three years, and teachers' wages have increased on an average 
from three to five dollars per month. 

Quite an effort has been put forth towards the grading of 
the rural schools but it has been difficult to accomplish much 
in this direction because of irregular attendance in some parts 
of the county. A number of districts have reported an average 
attendance of less than fifty per cent of the total enrollment. 
Graded questions have been sent out from this office for the 
past three years and for this present term monthly report 
cards have been sent to teachers with circular letters urging 
the importance of regular attendance. 

In the main our teachers are progressive and give considerable 
attention to the study uf methods. Nearly all of them 
take some school journals and we have had from ten to thirty 
taking the Reading Circle work. This present year we have 
more young teachers than usual, caused by the scarcity of 
teachers, and it has been found necessary to endorse certificates 
for some ten or twelve teachers from outside the county.

high school graduates or have had normal instruction or both. 
The interest taken by the teachers has awakened a lively interest 
in the schools, and the average attendance is greatly 
increased this autumn. More system is being adopted, shorter 
lessons given and greater thoroughness is being demanded. 
Harmony and good feeling exist in all the departments In 
most instances the teachers are located in districts where 
their special fitness makes each particularly adapted to the 
needs and requirements of the district. 

As a result of an apparent shortage of teachers many districts 
secured the pick of the teachers early in the season. 
This demand for successful experienced teachers materially increased 
the wages paid and an average gain of two dollars each 
over last year's monthly wages is reported. 

The number of months school for the year has been increased 
in many places and the future prospect for better schools 
throughout the county is very flattering. W. H. Hyland. 

THAYER COUNTY 

We have ninety-eight districts employing 130 teachers, with 
a school population of 5,236. New school buildings are being 
built every year to replace the older ones, and in every instance 
they are built after the latest approved plan, thus showing, 
in part at least, that the best building they can afford is 
not too good for their children. 

The Thayer County School Board Association was organized 
in June, and this, we believe, will be an important factor 
in arousing further interest in educational matters, as one of 
the main objects of this body or organization-is to support and 
assist the county superintendent in carrying on his work. 
Upon the recommendation of the School Board Association, a 
committee of seven members, consisting of the county superintendent, 
president and secretary of the association and four 
leading teachers of the county was appointed to recommend a 
uniform system of text books for use in the county. A central 
depository has been established at the county seat, where old 
books may be exchanged and new ones purchased. The result 
is very gratifying, as many of the districts have already purchased 
the books recommended. 

The professional interest among our teachers is good. Only 
twenty per cent of our present teaching force have had no </seg>

former experience. All of the teachers are working under 
the new Course of Study and the classes in most of the schools 
at least are graded as carefully as the classes are in the city 
schools. Last year the county superintendent examined 154 
eighth grade pupils for High school privileges. 

Khe Reading Circle work is a strong feature in this county, 
our teachers are deriving much benefit from it. The printl 
book used this year is Hodge's Nature Study and Life. 

The county is divided into seveu sections, and each section 
will hold seven meetings besides the two general meetings, 
which will be held at the county seat. Nearly every teacher 
has purchased a copy of the Reading Circle book, and we expect 
interesting meetings. 

Only a few of the districts are purchasing a school library 
with public funds; many of them, however, are establishing 
school libraries with funds secured by a public school entertainment, 
box social, etc. These school libraries are a wonderful 
factor in bringing the school nearer to the home. Some 
legislation is needed to secure to the school and community a 
good and growing library. It would be a benefaction to the 

Vocal music was made a special feature in our annual Institute, 
and many of the teachers will teach music in their schools 
this year. We have also adopted the daily program which is 
based on the four group plan, as outlined in the new Course of 
Study. This, we believe, will result in more uniform and 
more thorough work in the schools of the county. We are 
striving to get all our schools to working on a system and thus 
doing away with the haphazard, hit-or-miss plan that has 
been in vogue in so many of the districts.

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

Most schools are well furnished and supplied with text 
books, and as a rule, the teachers, by their energy and industry, 
make up, in a large measure, to the children the loss sustained 
by short school years and lack of maps, charts and apparatus, 
and children show their appreciation of. such service by attending 
regularly in spite of long distances, poor loads and 
lack of bridges. Quite a number of Indian children attend the 
district schools and are remarkable for their good conduct and 
studious habits. We believe that Indian children acquire the 
Kof the English language and customs more readily and at 
uch less expense than in the government schools. This 
year for the first time in the history of the county, pupils are 
ruraged to attend regularly and make better grades by the 
of regular attendance certificates, which earn diplomas, 
and monthly report cards furnished by the county superintendent. 


All schools are visited regularly, once each term, by the 
county superintendent, hence the office is at all times in close 
touch with every school in the county. 

There has been an increase in teachers' wages during the 
past year and, as a rule, a school board wishes to pay good 
wages for a good teacher. 

One school house, a modern pattern, has been erected during 
the present year. All things point to a pleasant and profitable 
school year for teachers, pupils and patrons.

VALLEY COUNTY 

All teachers have been supplied with the State Cours° of 
Study, and are grading their schools to it as closely as possible. 
Our Institute (1901) was well attended, having an enrollment 
of 102, when we require but seventy-six to fill all our 
schools with teachers. Our County Teachers' Associations 
have been well attended, and a good professional spirit is 
manifested. 

A number of our districts have introduced libraries in their 
schools. While our Beading Circle work has not been up to its 
fullest capacity, yet we think our schools have enjoyed a 
steady growth during the past year.

VALLEY COUNTY. 

The Teachers' Association was organized during the Institute. 
It plans for three general meetings during the year. 
The local divisions meet once each month. The Reading 
Circle is thoroughly organized, and the membership comprises 
nearly every active teacher in the county. 

Prom no other source do I look for better results than from 
the organization of the district school boards. The organization 
was completed in August and has already adopted a course 
of study (The Nebraska Course of Study). This course of study 
is in the hands of every rural teacher and is being followed 
closely. Provisions are being made for a truant officer for the 
county. They have adopted a uniform list of text books. All 
schools are provided with a uniform daily program. 

Many things indicate a strong, progressive, educational 
sentiment, among which are: 

1. A demand for better qualified teachers. 

2. A demand for a high moral standard in the teacher 

3. A willingness to a'dvance salaries. 
4. A tendency toward graded salaries. 

5. Better buildings and better care of buildings and grounds. 

6. The placing of students' libraries in many schools. 

EA desire among teachers for professional training and 
illingness to co-operate in all work for the benefit of our 
cational system. 

The high schools in the county are taxed to their capacity 
with pupils from the rural districts. 

The sentiment in favor of the adjunct district is growing 
steadily and will probably prevail in this county next year.

The schools are in fairly good condition at the present time. 
Several districts will have a longer term of school th's year. 
There is very little indebtedness in our country districts, and 
a fair supply of books, apparatus, and blackboards, is found in 
nearly every school house.

paying ten dollars a month more than was paid last year. </seg>

During our institute we made a special effort to impress 
upon the minds of the teachers the importance of teaching the 
child to read and I find in visiting the various schools of the 
county that the children are getting the benefit of the effort. 

K'he attendance and punctuality have been very much imved. 
The teachers are endeavoring to arouse much interest 
that direction in order to make the school work more 

In my visits I find that the teachers are following the course 
of study as nearly as can be done under the circumstances. 
We have the co-operation of the patrons in grading the schools. 

Our Reading Circle is in a healthy condition. About ninetyfive 
per cent of the actual teachers are enrolled besides quite a 
number of prospective teachers. Our Reading Circle is divided 
into four districts, and each district meets the second Saturday 
in each month during the school year. Much interest is 
manifested in the work.

pupils to complete th« eighth grade.

WHEELER COUNTY 

Although the county is thinly settled, the attendance is good 
and the average number of months of school is increasing. 
The people are liberal, many of the districts voting up to the 
limit, and better wages have been paid to teachers this past 
year than in previous years, but the schools are yet poorly 
supplied with maps, globes, supplementary readers, etc. 

Our teachers compare very favorably with those in the adjoiniug 
counties but there is a serious lack (not confined to this 
county) not so much in knowedge of the theory and art of 
teaching as in the practical application of such knowledge. 
Teachers who have been educated entirely in town schools are 
as a class far inferior for our country schools to those who 
have been educated in the country schools and have had. in addition, 
a couple of years in a higher school. 

I have tried to draw special attention to the necessity of 
thorough training in the elementary studies of reading, 
writing, composition and written and mental arithmetic which 
have, apparently, been somewhat neglected in the past. </seg>

WHEELER COUNTY 

I Wheeler county is rapidly iucrea»iug in population, the ret 
of which is better schools. No new school districts have 
n organized but old ones have been re-opened and placed 
i solid basis. The county is, as a whole, in a prosperous 
dition, educationally. Never before were the schools so 
rly supplied with experienced teachers. Only three who 
e no experience are numbered with the teaching force, 
ichers' salaries average higher than ever before, as nearly 
the schools appreciate a good teacher and are not afraid to 
' for her services. 

I We have no Teachers' Association. The State Course of 
ady has been adopted and is being carried out very successly. 
Our schools have been sadly neglected along the line 
penmanship and drawing. I have placed in the hands of 
' teachers good charts in writing and Ida Tew Davis's 
thods of drawing. I find the pupils making rapid progress, 
xt year in connection with this, reading will be a specialty. 

ffheeler county has no graded schools or high schools, but 
have a system of gradation in our rural schools. 

Ee hold two weeks of Institute and have no trouble in 
ing our teachers to attend. The sentiment for better 
hers is growing. In consequence but few third grade cerates 
have beeii issued. 

Eost of our districts have good buildings, well furnished

I am confident that in the near future Wheeler county will 
rank high among the western counties of the state.

school and the number in country districts who are preparing 
for the eighth grade examinations has increased wonderfully 
the past two years. Las« year two hundred four pupils took 
the examinations, representing thirty-six districts. Eightythree 
were successful. The township graduating exercises 
have had a great deal to do with this. We began three years 
ago with exercises in one township. Six townships joined the 
next year, and last year all townships that had graduates held 
these exercises. We closed with a county exercise at York in 
which the eighth grade graduates of York and other towns 
joined with the country districts. This has given such an impulse 
to work in the districts that we shall repeat it this year. 

All eighth grades in the town schools, except York, require 
the puDils to pass the county examination before admission to 
the high school. This has unified our town schools. We have 
a High School Association, and a County Declamatory 
Association that keep the towns of the county in touch with 
each other, and make work very harmonious. Our principals 
in this way, and in conducting local teachers' reading circles, 
are of great service to the younger teachers of the county. 

Our Reading Circle plan has been in operation three years 
and I am highly pleased with it. 

Our spelling contest last year, when we had a contest the 
same day in all schools in the county, where delegates were 
chosen to meet by townships the next week, and there 
choose delegates for the county central contest, was an 
occasion of interest. We concluded this with an inter-county 
contest with our neighbors on the west and south, Pillmore 
and Hamilton counties. 

Two new modern schoolhouses are being builded tbis year. 
One is finished. We went after some people who did not 
send children to school last year, and expect to do so aerain 
this year if occasion demands it. The York Business College 
and Normal School is a new addition, also Bethesda College 
at Henderson, a German-English college. 

A School Board organization has been effected. Lists of 
text books were adopted tbis year. 

We have a county educational paper, The Public School. It 
is a good thing, and takes well. Ed: C. Bishop. </seg>

ALBION 

The Albion schools are provide with two brick buildings 
situated on adjoining blocks. This arrangement affords ample 
school grounds, and is a great convenience for supervision. 
The location is quite central and transfers from one building 
to the other can be easily made. 

The high school course includes about three and one half 
years-of regular high school work, or twenty-five credit points. 
Beginning with September, 1903, the schools will have a full four 
years' high school course. This will mean twenty-eight credit 
points and reviews of common branches. There is no desire 
to excel in the number of credit points. 

The school sentiment in Albion is of the best. Patrons in 
general are very loyal to educational work and the board of 
education is composed of conservative and progressive 
business men. The corps of teachers is made up of well 
qualified, and for the most part, experienced teachers. The 
K' has a well equipped and well managed library, and three 
cational clubs of twenty members each. Two of these 
have been organized more than two years. One pursues the 
Chautauqua course, one American History and Art and one 
General History. A strong public lecture course is also 
managed by these educational clubs. 

The schools are growing steadily. One teacher has been 
added each vear during the past four years. This is largely 
due to the fact that many parents establish their homes in 
Albion to take advantage of the schools. J. J. King. 

ALLIANCE 

Alliance, the metropolis of the great Northwest Nebraska, 
within a few years has advanced from a small village to a city 
of more than three thousand persons (census taken June, 1902), 
and her school population has correspondingly increased, 
though as in all railroad towns, her school population is not so 
large as in other cities of the same size; yet her school population, 
in the last two years, has increased more than one 
hundred. 

The schools, employing sixteen teachers, are yet in a congested 
condition, and without doubt within the next year an 
additional ward building of four rooms will be erected. The </seg>

above fifty. 

Ebe school is in a healthy condition financially, having but 
Ive thousand dollars of bonded indebtedness, and ample 
is with which to pay its teachers. 

i'he school sentiment is good and is gradually growing 
&gt;nger. The board of education is composed of business and 
fessional and progressive people who take pride in their 
ools, and who say ' 'Nothing is too good for our schools. ' ' The 
ool has been under the present management during the past 
' years and the superintendent has three years more to serve. 
W. Hayes is principal of the High school witn an enroillt 
of about seventy pupils. 

Khe school is quite well supplied with laboratory facilities 
apparatus for botany, physics and chemistry 

I'he motto of the school is how well rather than how much 
anything can be learned and given. The country 'round 
ut Alliance is mostly devoted to grazing, hence, not so 
skly settled, consequently the number of non-resident pupils 
iot so great though the number so attending is not by any 
ins the smallest in the state. The school ground, besides 
play ground, contains a well kept lawn which is a credit 
he city and a beautiful scene upon which to gaze. The 
unds also contain trees which in a few years will offer

ASHLAND 

School district No. 1, Saunders county, now known as the 
Ashland school district, was organized in 1866, with W. P. 
Snell as the first treasurer. This school was taught by John 
Bliss in a log house, fourteen by sixteen feet in size, and 
situated on the bank of Salt Creek. 

The present high school building was erected in 1871, and, 
to meet the demands of the growing town, a large addition 
to the north was erected five years later. There is one ward 
school of two rooms. In the main building twelve teaehers 
are engaged, eight in the grades and four in the high school. 
This arrangement adds greatly to the convenience of superintendence. 
BDth buildings are connected by public telephone. </seg>

The organization gives one distinct grade to a teacher with 
one exception in the ward school. 

Ashland was one of the first schools in the state to be placed 
upon the accredited list of the State University. Two courses 
are offered, classical and English. Latin is carried four years, 
with the privilege of substituting German in the last two 
years. Normal review work is given in the twelfth grade, for 
the benefit especially of those who wish to teach. The high 
school course is changed and strengthened from year to year 
to meet the requirements of the university and the demands 
of the community. 

An active and Drogressive literary society, which has been 
in operation for thirteen years, is under the management of 
the high school pupils. Meetings are held twice a month in 
the evening, and are open to the public. This has been the 
means largely of the success of the school in the State oratorical 
contests. 

IVlusic is taught in all the grades under the direction of a 
?cial instructor. Nature study is being emphasized this 
ir and considerable stress is placed reading and clear 
alysis in arithmetic; yet no one subject is given prominence 
the detriment of the fundamentals. The board is liberal in 
dealings with the school and supports the system loyally, 
veral additions have been made to the laboratory, which at 
esent is well equipped for the sciences. There is a good 
aool sentiment, and higher education is strongly encouraged, 
large per cent of the graduates attend college. A general 
irary is maintained, funds for which are raised by public 
tertainments. A three hundred dollar piano was purchased

six and eight rooms respectively, are sufficient for the

the eighth grade. It is now occupied by the high school 
alone, the attendance of which makes a very crowded condition. 

The high school building has an assembly room, a room for 
seating the eleventh and twelfth grades, a recitation room, a 
laboratory fairly equipped for botany, physics and chemistry, 
and an office for the superintendent and the board of education. 
The September enrollment was 171, an increase of twenty-four 
over the attendance of one year ago. About forty of our 
pupils are from the neighboring towns and from the country 
scoools. All of our high school teachers, three in number 
besides the superintendent, are university graduates and are 
thought to be competent instructors. The course of study ia 
not so large as that of some schools but we do not caro to 
attempt more with the present number of teachers. It i# 
a four year course offering the following subjects and points: 
English, 6 ;. Latin, 8 ; German , 4; Algebra, 3; Geometry, 3; 
Trigonometry, 1 ; History, 4 ; Physical Geography, 1 ; Botany, 
1 ; Physics, 1 ; Chemistry, 1 : Agriculture, 1 ; Civics, 1 ; Political 
Economy, 1 ; Book-keeping, 1 ; Reviews, 2. 

Kl'hirty points are required for graduation. Some of the 
»jects are r«quired but in the third and fourth years there 
several electives. Two or three of the electives are offered 
alternate years, reducing the number of classes. 

For several years a high school literary society has been in 
operation, meeting in the assembly room every Monday evening. 
This work is encouraged by the citizens and by the 
teachers. Athletic sDorts have been encouraged and yet there 
are some restrictions. We have a uniformed, equipped, and 
well drilled cadet company of about thirty members. Our 
instructor in military tactics is under the direction of the 
high school principal and was formerly First Lieutenant in 
Company H, Twentieth Kansas Regiment, U. S. V. JJ 

For two years our school has held the leading position in 
high school athletics in Southeastern Nebraska. In debate 
Auburn has for two years been on the winning side. We try 
to emphasize the importance of good preparation for the high 
school, thorough work in the high school, and of making the 
most'of one's self. Twenty-two of the last three classes have 
gone to college, ,and twenty-two have become teachers.

his part of town is greatly needed. 

On account of the crowded"condition of the primary room

teacher having been engaged and assigned to "first grade 
work, full day sessions are allowed' and the little ones in the

town for their school work. 

IPhe eighth grade and the high school have comparatively 
all enrollments, there being less than seventy pupils enled 
in the four highest grades, while the entire enrollment 
11 approach five hundred. This is [due in part to the preice

for advanced work. As a result many pupils are io the higher 
grades without a firm foundation or thorough preparation for 
the work. The teachers, however, are endeavoring to bettor 
the character of the work, and are assisting in properly Trading 
the nupils so that the work of the schools may be more 
uniform and the nupils located in their proper place*. Th« 
board and the patrons as well as the teachers are anxious that 
the schools be lifted to a higher plane. 

Mr. Phipps divided the school year into two semesters of 
three terms each. This lightens the work of preparing reports. 
PudUs are graded this year by letters instead of per 
cents. No mid-session recess is granted pupils above the sixth 
grade. This has a good effect on the order and discipline of 
the schools. Some progress has been made in lessening the 
cigarette evil which is very prevalent with oar bov 
Chadron. 

The high school is doing only three years' work as bot 
one teacher beside the superintendent is assigned to this department. 
The work is so arranged and divided between 
these two that the superintendent is allowed nearly half a 
day for the work of supervision. The library and laboratory 
equipment is small. There is enough laboratory equipment to 
do some work in botany and physics. 

The board of education is composed of busy men who have 
to make great sacrifices of time and labor in order to attend to 
school affairs. Owing to the nature of their occupations it is 
difficult to have meetings of the board as often as it may he 
desired. The members of the board have given assurances 
to the superintendent that they will do all in their power to 
keep the schools on as high a level as possible. The people 
of Chadron are greatly interested in their schools, as people 
who build such a pretty town, with green lawns and shade 
trees, in the midst of a dry country, naturally would be. 
They also promise their hearty support of the schools.

conditions that prevail at the present time. Our pupils are 
cared for in five buildings, all in good repair. Our High 
school building is modern in the strictest sense, and conveniently 
located. In the grades we endeavor to lay emphasis 
upon a few subjects: Reading, arithmetic and language. 

Our school rooms are pleasant, well lighted and fairly well supplied 
with pictures. Music is taught in all the grades under 
the direction of a special teacher. Our Higii school offers two 
courses — Latin and English-Science. During the past year 
our laboratory facilities have been much increased. An excellent 
High school library is constantly receiving additions. 
The leading publications are found in our reading room. A 
lecture course, under the management of the senior class, has 
the hearty support of the citizens. The High school orchestra, 
composed of some twenty school pupils, and under the leadership 
of the teacher of music, is one of our most popular organizations. 
The "Reflector," the High school paper, issued 
monthly during the school year, has grown in favor with pupils 
and patrons. Each issue is illustrated, contains articles 
by teachers and pupils, and is carefully edited. 

The school spirit is good, the teaching corps efficient and 
the support of the people loyal. W. M. Kern. 

CRETE 

The Crete schools are well housed in substantial buildings 
and quite well supplied with the essential accessories. It is 
the policy to give a thorough training in the grades in all the 
fundamentals required as a basis for a strong high school 
course. Five teachers in the high school — four college graduates 
and one normal graduate of broad experience — care for 
the one hundred twenty-five pupils who take a four years' 
course. All grade teachers are normal or college graduates 
or teachers of some years' experience. 

Practical English is receiving special attention. Many pupils 
do not go beyond the grades, but there is no reason why 
they should go into the world unable to use our mother tongue 
properly. Some of the more useful methods of securing good 
results in English are used. More oral and less written work 
is being urged in order to strengthen the power of ready, accurate 
thought. The quickest and simplest way to learn to </seg>

Ik is to talk. With this in view, three debating societies 
/e been organized and the school room furnished with elee: 
lights for the convenience of these and oH i rational 
therings. Note books in history will not bi&gt; used as moch 
formerly, but more thinking and oral expression will be r»»-ired. 


The entire course in numbers and arithmetic has been revised 
and so carefully graded that there is no abrupt break at 
any point. No time is wasted on obsolete topics nor puxzling 
impractical problems. Many applications to daily lif»» are 
made and pupils are led to see that arithmetic is a live subject. 
Mental arithmetic will be introduced this year. Algebra begins 
in the seventh grade and geometry in the eighth. 

In the high school program the plan of alternating some 
studies, as history and English, having proved unsatisfactory, 
has been abandoned. A very noticeable improvement in tbe 
preparation of lessons is already seen. A course is now offered 
which leads to graduation without Latin, and yet is difficult 
enough, so that it is not likely to be sought for its ease. 
Greek has been dropped from the course. 

The grading below the high school is such that who 
can move forward more rapidly than others may do so without 
inconvenience to teachers or classmates. Many will 
complete eight grades in seven years. This method recognizes 
the differing ability of pupils without discouraging 
the weaker ones. 


I'rom the time the pupil enters the piimary grade until 
duation. a kindly but persistent effort is made to develop 
)ng, true character. Taxes for public schools are paid for 
purpose of making good citizens, and no school should 
duate a morally worthless boy or srirl. If they cannot be remed

DAVID CITY 

Eie present school year at David City opened up with a 
e attendance. The fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth grades 
ell as the High school, are full to overflowing. 

The classes in the High school have outgrown the laboratories 
and recitation rooms; and the board of education, of 
which Matt Miller is president, and Mrs. Emma Riddell secretary, 
think that something will have to be done to increase 
the capacity by another year. 

There are eleven teachers employed in the grades; besides, 
ther*» is a special music teacher employed, who teaches music 
in both the grades and the High school two days of each week. 
A special music class is conducted once in two weeks by the 
director of music for the benefit of the grade teachers. This 
instruction, in addition to what the teachers already know, 
and having the special teacher in their rooms twice a week, is 
making them efficient in their work, and rapidly making independent 
note readers of our pupils. 

In the regular semi-monthly meetings of all the city teachers, 
special attention is being given to general school management, 
grade and primary work. In our meetings a class is taught in 
phonics; two weeks from that time a class in reading, language, 
spelling, numbers, etc., every two weeks. So far this has 
proven satisfactory and helpful to the other teachers. 

We give special attention to reading in the primary grades, 
using a combination of the word, phrase and sentence methods. 
In the other grades special attention is given to the different 
subjects as they are taken up. Our belief is, that a pupil well 
started in a subject is far on his way to success in that branch.

ool year reached 805, of which seventy-five were beginners 
I 135 were in the high school, while the grades numbered 
the way from forty-five to 110 each. 

The high school has four departments of instruction, -Eng' 
lish and History, Mathematics, Science, Latin and German. 
Two courses are offered ; one has four years of Latin and in 
the other two years of sciences and two of German take the 
place of Latin. However, the greater part of the students 
choose the regular Latin course. 

There is a good working library for reference in English 
and History, to which additions are beine made from time to 
time. The laboratory has been greatly improved during the 
past three years and now furnishes excellent facilities for individual 
work in botany, physics and chemistry. The work in 
Latin and German covers all the university requirements not 
only in readings and translations but also in composition and 
constructive work. 

Ei June, 1902, the school graduated six boys and six girls; 
the class of 1903 at present consists of twelve boys and

About two blocks from the Central grounds is a building of 
two rooms used by the preparatory grade and a part of the

The high school building has recently been provided with a

rooms have been furnished with single seats and slate blackboards 
and everything is being done to have the school facilities 
of the latest and best. Financially the district is in an excellent

FALLS CITY 

The board of education has in its emplov twenty teachers, 
including two assistants in the primary department. 

Earnestness and progressiveness characterize the educational 
work in every department. The teachers are unusually 
progressive and wide awake, and to their efforts is due the 
high standing of the schools among state educational institu- 

The enrollment for the year 1901 -'02 was 765. This, with an 
enrollment of 150 in the Ursuline convent, makes a total of 
ninety per cent of children of school age attending school. 
Less than six children took advantage of the exemptions in 
the compulsory attendance law last year. 

Iourteen per cent of the number enrolled were found in the 
i school, and this year seventeen per cent are in the high 
x&gt;l, making a larger per cent and a larger enrollment in 
high school than at any time during the past six years, 
ire are more boys in the high school today than ever before, 
ire are two debating societies under high school manageit, 
and last year the board of education employed a special 
sher of physical culture and elocution. Athletics are ened 
in under proper control, and Falls City is noted for the 
ness and good behavior of its boys in all contests. 

The business department, in charge of a special teacher, is 
a feature of the schools, and the classes in parliamentary law 
and mechanical drawing are deservedly popular. There is a

The work of the past two years in the Fremont schools has 
been quite successful. The corps of teachers as a whole is a 
strong one. 

Music has been added to the course, and placed under the

IFhe new course of study is now in full operation in all 
ides. This course adds much English and one year of Latin 
the High school; it enriches the reading in the primary and

ithetic reading. 

The school is graded on the half year interval plan, with 
promotions to the High school only once a year. 

An observation school, which is a part of the city schools, 
has been established at the Normal school. 

Kremont is trying this year the "old-fashioned" outdoor

All eighth grade pupils are accommodated in one buildingi 
where a large assembly room and two recitation rooms are 
used for that purpose. There are three eighth grade teachers 
and the work is divided on the departmental plan as much as 
possible. It has proved very satisfactory. 

No new buildings have been builded recently, but considerable 
money has been spent in repairs. Nearly all the nine

been rearranged *to meet the requirements of the university. 
Nature study has been introduced in the grades and much 
interest is manifested by both teachers and pupils. 

Our course of study covers twelve complete grades. There 
is but one course in the high school, and this contains three 
years of Latin and one of German. The high school instructors 
are all graduates of the university. The teachers in the 
grades are all well fitted for their work. 

Rhetoricals have been made a part of the regular work and 
will be required of all pupils. 

Eilitary drill is required of all high school boys twice each

¦ Our high school library has made considerable growth and a 
few reference books in history have been secured. Much more 
is needed along this line in order that the best work may be 
accomplished. The laboratory facilities, while not the best, 
are used in such a way as to bring as good results as possible. 

The people of Friend are loyal and are interested in our 
schools. They have elected very capable men as members 
of the board of education who spare no effort to make the 
schools of a high standard. The work of the teachers has

During the child's first two years the work is so divided as 
to give great flexibility. The classes are so near together 
that promotions are common at any time. We have a preliminary

HASTINGS 

[ince our last biennial report the Hastings schools have 
ntained their reputation for substantial, satisfactory work, 
as been the aim to employ only teachers of ability, and so 
as practical, teachers of good experience, and in this we 
that we have been successful. 

For the past two years we have been obliged to place some 
of our schools in unsatisfactory quarters for lack of room in 
the regular school buildings. We hope in the near future to 
have a commodious and up-to-date High school building. 

More loyal people to school interests than the citizens of 
Hastings, cannot be found. We have a board of education 
consisting of nine members who are among the very best 
business men of the city, and who have the very best educational 
interests of the city at heart. 

Each teacher attends two meetings each month, one general 
meeting and one meeting with the teachers of her particular 
grade. At these meetings, some work in the line of pedagogy 
is systematically studied, besides the discussion of special 
grade topics. These meetings are regarded by the teachers 
as very helpful and inspiring. We have both music and drawing 
taught in all grades below the High school, under the 
direction of a special teacher or supervisor. 

We are in need of a High school building, yet even with the 
present surroundings we are having in the high school an excellent 
quality of work. We are becoming somewhat better </seg>

The schools are conducted in two buildings and eleven 
teachers are employed »tt an average salary of over $44.00 a 
month. In arithmetic the Werner three book plan has been 
used for the last four years with most excellent results. The 
history of our own country is begun in the fifth grade by 
reading The Story of Our Thirteen Colonies and The Story 
of Our Great Republic. In the seventh grade an elementary 
history is studied and thoroughly reviewed. A more advanced 
text is taken throughout the eighth year. The aim is to make 
the pupils as efficient in the common branches as their age 
and mental development will allow before they leave the 
eighth grade, even if they have to take two years to do it. 

I he high school has a "single four years' course of study, 
purpose is to strengthen the student in the common 
oches and at the same time give a broad and liberal foundai 
for a special or a college education, should the student 
irwards desire it. Three years of Latin and one of German 
required to graduate. Special stress is laid on review of 
imon branches. One year of three recitations a week is 
at on English grammar and the same amount of time on 
ancwd U. S. History; while a half year each is devoted to 
hmetic, bookkeeping and physiology. 

The time element in the development of the student's mind is 
considered in arranging the studies. For four years the plan 
of taking algebra one half year, then dropping it and taking 
geometry the same length of time, to be followed, in tarn, by 
another half year of algebra and so on until both subjects have 
been completed, has been tried. The result, when contrasted 
with that of the old plan of completing one subject before 
taking up another, is surprising. Over tweuty per cent of the 
entire school enrollment is in the high school.

the true western grit and push. Its schools, almost from the 
very first, have maintained a high rank. Within less than 
three years after the town was established it had built a handsome 
substantial seven-room brick school house and organized 
a complete graded school system. 

Soon after the graded schools were established W. R. Hart 
was elected city superintendent, which position he held for 
eight years. It was exceedingly fortunate that, for so long a 
time during this formative period, the schools were directed by 
a man with so much industry, energy, and organizing power. 
The schools were thus founded on the principles of honesty 
and thoroughness, and all superficial, or merely show work 
was discouraged. 

In 1894, Superinteadent Hart was succeeded by A. B. 
Stephens, a man of ability ;'and energy, who maintained the 
high standard previously established and kept the schools 
abreast of the times. Much credit for the work during this 
time is also due to Jos. R. Fulk who for four years was principal 
of the high school. Many of our young men and young 
women will carry through life the impress of his earnest, 
honest, inspiring personality. 

E little over two years ago the schools passed under the

aim to emphasize strongly the fundamental branches,

began the introduction of the spiral method in arithmetic, 
jing it at that time in the third and fourth grades. It is

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

The growth of our high school during the past two years has 
been extremely gratifying. For the year ending in May, 1900, 
the average daily attendance was 60. Last year it reached 94 
and so far this year it has been 102, an. increase in a little over 
two years of 70 per cent. This is due in part to the increase 
in the number of non-resident pupils, but chiefly to the fact 
that a much larger number of pupils remain until they complete 
the course. Our present senior class contains twentyone 
pupils. We have only one high school course and all who 
graduate are required to take everything in the course. We 
are also specially proud of our high school discipline. We 
do not have what has been named "pupil government" but 
we believe that in very few high schools is discipline so largely 
the result of personal self control on the part of each student. 

For a number of years the board was greatly hampered by 
a lack of funds, but they used wisely what they had, and this 
difficulty is, we believe, disappearing. We are at present 
cramped by a lack of sufficient room for our high school, but 
this will doubtless come soon. The outlook for the Holdrege 
schools is bright. J. F. Conner.

public schools. Ir the high school five teachers, all University 
graduates, are employed. Two courses, a Latin and an English, 
are offered, but few students accept the latter. Out of 
170 students less than half a dozen are pursuing the English 
course. The entire work of the high school is given thirtyfive 
and one-half credits with the University. It is not our policy 
to increase this list of credits, but it is our aim to strengthen 
the instruction until the work done shall stand for the most 
thorough scholarship. The spirit of higher education is 
prevalent and a large number of graduates are pursuing studies 
in technical schools, colleges and the university. 

The first class graduated was in 1884. Since that time 
students have been graduated. In 1902 the class consisted of 
eleven boys and eleven girls. Th« present enrollment show* 
62 boys and 108 girls. The boys are largely in the ninth grade. 

fie work of the sixth, seventh and eighth grades in Whittier 
ol approaches the Departmental plan; one teacher teacharithmetic, 
one geography and one language. The plan 
many excellent features and is entirely satisfactory. 

irhe military company organized some years ago is contin-3. 
From forty to fifty boys take regular drill from three to 
&gt;r o'clock on Tuesdays and Thursdays. A competitive drill, 
¦ a prize, occurs at the close of each year. The cadets are 
i formed and drill with arms. Much interest is manifested 
this company. The influence of the manly bearing of the 
lets is most salutary upon the school. 

The students have in their own hands the editing and management 
of the Quidest, a monthly publication. The expenses 
of the paper are met by the advertising columns ; the business 
men of the city patronize this enterprise liberally. 

Ehe spirit of athletics is prevalent ; base ball, foot ball and 
let ball come in for the largest share of interest. Our exence 
is that wholesome sports, if well regulated, assist the 
?ress and interest of the school. 

i?he constantly diminishing tax list of the last few years has 
iously interfered with the progress of education in our city,

they should be. We look forward in the uear future to the introduction 
of manual training a3 a part of the regular work; 
the Ward system of reading has been introduced into the primary 
grades; our laboratories are being extended and perfected 
to meet the increasing demands of the new education; our 
teachers are awake and enthusiastic and are carrying regular 
work in professional study; we look forward to the establishment 
of a professional library in the school for the especial 
benefit of the teachers. While we are never satisfied, while we 
can never reach the ideal, we feel a fair degree of satisfaction 
in the progress we are making, and have faith that the schools 
will meet the ever increasing demands of the future.

LINCOLN 

School accommodations have been materially improved during 
the past year by the erection of two new buildings and the 
enlargement of two others. A four-room addition to the 
Capitol school building gives this school now twelve rooms 
above the basement. The two basement rooms will be used 
for manual training. Four rooms have been added to the 
Whittier, formerly a four-room building, making this now a 
full graded school. A new four-room brick buildiiig has been 
erected in the Randolph district and a ten-room building on 
the central grounds. The latter is of red brick, the interior 
furnished throughout in oak. The lighting, heating, ventilation, 
blackboards and other appointments have received special 
attention and are fully up to date. One room in the basement 
is being fitted up for a cooking school, another for shopwork 
and a third for the art department. The new school has 
been named the McKinley school. A new six-room building 
is needed at Hayward and a two-room building at West A. 
With these the grades would be well accommodated for the 
present. The high school, however, feels greatly tne need of 
a new building. 

A decided effort was made during the year to carry out the 
provisions of the new compulsory education law, and while to 
some extent successful the results were far from satisfactory. 
Information was secured by the truant officer showing infraction 
of the law in a number of cases, but no suits were instituted 
owing to the doubts expressed by the court as to the </seg>

            <seg id="p326">

COUNTY AND CITY SCHOOLS. 

constitutionality of the law. The educational effect of the 
movement toward enforcement, however, has been wholesome, 
and in many cases parents who have been neglectful have admitted 
the justice of the law and have expressed a willing 
to follow its instructions. In many cases parents lack the 
power to control their children, and the only resource in such 
cases is the establishment of parental schools. In some portions 
of the city a considerable proportion of the population 
leave for the beet fields in the early spring and return too late 
in the fall to meet the requirements as to attendance. As yet 
we have found no satisfactory solution for this problem. 

Euring the year the question of salaries and certificates has 
jived thorough consideration and new rules adopted emying 
the following essential principles : 

EWith the exception of music, drawing and principles and 
stice of teaching no examination will be required, but cerates 
will be granted on the presentation of scholastic 
lits as follows: 

ta. Fourth grade limited to four years, not renewable, to 
given on election to all teachers; the minimum requirents 
for election to be the completion of the equivalent of a 
[ four-year high school course and three years' successful 
&gt;erience in teaching (college graduates two years). 

b. Third grade (five years) on college credits showing 
thirty hours' work, state life certificate, or diploma from 
higher courses in state normal schools, an I one year in Lincoln 
schools. 

c. Second grade (five years) on college credits showing 
seventy-five hours' work and two years in Lincoln schools. 

d. First grade (permanent) to college graduates who 
have had one year's experience in Lincoln schools. 

2. Credit will be allowed for other professional work under 
such restrictions as the examining committee shall prescribe. 

K. The maximum salary was raised to $70 per month, with 
lual monthly increase until this figure is reached as follows : 

a. Four dollars per month to all without conditions. 

tb. To those holding first, second or third grade certifis, 
who obtained credits during the* preceding year equivato 
three hours of University work, an additional two dolper 
month. </seg>

            <seg id="p327">
912 

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

4. When a teacher has reached the maximum of $70, she is 
allowed an increase of not to exceed one dollar per month per 
annum for the equivalent of four hours of college work completed, 
the amount thus granted not to exceed $ 10 in all. 

5. No teacher doing full work in the school shall be allowed 
to take more than five hours of university work. 

The feature of special importance in these rules is the recognition 
given to professional spirit and work as shown by the 
egress made in preparation and in advanced study. While 
teacher is required to take up courses of study, the financial 
sideration offers an effective inducement, of which few will 
fail to avail themselves. At present not less than threefourths 
of the teachers are engaged in some university or 
other professional line of study, which will add materially to 
their efficiency in the schoolroom. 

Another important step taken by the board of education is 
the adoption of Manual Training as an essential feature of the 
work of the schools. The work will be introduced gradually 
as funds are available. For this year a cooking school will be 
established in the new school on the central grounds, and po s . 
sibly one later for woodwork. More or less manual training 
is already carried on in connection with drawing in the primary 
grades, but no complete introduction will be attempted 
until a competent supervisor has been secured. 

furing the year the teachers of the city schools have visited 
schools of Minneapolis and Omaha. Over one hundred 
teachers took part in each of these excursions. 

A change in the headship of the High school has taken 
place this year, in the election of Dr. H. K. Wolfe to the position 
made vacant by the resignation of Dr. H. J. Davenport, 
who goes to the University of Chicago as instructor in 
economics. 

A school paper, called the School Index, is published regularly 
by the superintendent and principals, and is distributed 
to pupils in the schools free. The paper, which is now in its 
second volume, is designed for the discussion of school questions 
of local importance and as a means of communication between 
the schools and the patrons. C. H. Gordon. </seg>

MCCOOK 

The past two years have been prosperous ones for McCook 
and the McCook schools. A valuable criterion of a town's 
growth is found in its school attendance. In September of 
this year we enrolled 772 pupils, as against 728 in 1901, 699 
in 1900, and 661 in 1899. There are 932 persons of school age 
this year in the district, whereas last year there were 928 and 
in 1900, 908. This marked increase in numbers has necessitated 
a larger teaching force, and each year since 1899 one additional 
teacher has been put to work. At present we have a 
total of seventeen teachers, three of whom, including the 
superintendent, work in the high school, and at the beginning 
of the new year we expect to increase the high school force by 
one more assistant. Besides these, we maintain a night school 
in typewriting and stenography, which at present is under the 
able direction of Mr. L. W. Stayner, special teacher in these 
branches. 

The unpaid bonded indebtedness of our school district is such 
as to make impossible the erection of the substantial and commodious 
central building we sorely need. But four buildings 
afford us sufficient room, one of these being a temporary fourroom 
frame structure, adjoining the high school, from which 
it is heated. 

Our course of study embraces the work of twelve years, but 
in addition we maintain a preparatory school, to which the beginners 
are sent and fitted for the first grade. For five-yearolds 
this may require a year's time, though the kindergarten 
drills and the attention we give to practical school work, as 
reading, insures rapid progress through the grades. Each 
primary teacher has about forty children under her charge, 
while the teachers from the third to the eighth grades inclusive 
enroll on the average rather more than fifty. No 
teacher, however, has more than one grade, which is divided 
into "A" and "B" divisions, these being kept one-half year 
apart. Promotions are accordingly made twice each year. 

We devote four years to the high school work, though we 
offer but a single course. We endeavor to make it a sufficient 
preparation for life for those who will not prosecute their 
studies farther, and conform at the same time to the University 
requirements. Our graduates enter the University with- </seg>

out conditions, with full twenty-eight points credit. We have 
a well equipped laboratory for chemistry, botany and physics. 
It is our special pride, and the clean character of it attests our 
interest in its development. Each year we add a little to its 
improvement, and this season it is our intention to purchase 
$100 to $150 worth of physical apparatus. The source study 
in history has passed the experimental stage, and in literature 
the Sherman method is in successful operation in the English 
classes of all four grades. Each pupil is required to read 
yearly a stated number of standard works, selected, under his 
teacher's guidance, from our school library. The library contains 
about 800 volumes, is in a separate room, and is under 
the control of a high school pupil as librarian. All puDils 
have access to the new city library, the books for which were 
partly chosen with reference to the children's needs. 

A feature of our work of marked advantage in the matter of 
discipline and school spirit is the morning assembly, at which 
are present all the teachers and pupils connected with the high 
school, as well as the members of the eighth grade. By this 
means the break between the eighth and ninth grades is partially 
overcome, and much of the trouble that often prevails in 
grammar grades is absent. The exercises are in charge of the 
superintendent. 

forty-five young men, members of the assembly, belong to 
high school company of cadets, and drill three evenings 
l week in military tactics. The company will soon be uniaed. 
and a movement is on foot to have it equipped with 
is and accoutrements by Christmas. We have teams in 
ball, base ball and basket ball, and there is a debating 
&gt;, whose members meet Saturday evenings for drill and 
2tice in debating and public speaking. 

Il8 a corps our teachers are exceptionally .strong and eneric, 
and carry on a course of professional study, meeting 
ee times each month for that purpose. The exprit de corps 
plendid, and their hearty co-operation in all that pertains 
be school's advancement is amply met by a gratifying 
col sentiment in the community at large, and by the devoi 
to the school's betterment of an especially able, progres-3 
and business-like board of education.

NEBRASKA CITY 

Nebraska City, though about the oldest city in the state, 
shows no alarming increase in school attendance. However, 
she does more than hold her own. In 1900-1901, the school 
attendance was 1,633, while last year it was 1,712. The teaching 
force consists of thirty-five teachers including the superintendent. 
Of these, six are employed iu the^high school and 
twenty- nine in the grades. 

Ebe work of the schools is covered by twelve grades — eight 
w the high school. The aim of the entire course is well 
in- &lt;t instruction. The past year, especial stress has been 
ed upon spelling, arithmetic, and English. 

I 'here are eight school buildings. Last year a new high 
ool building was erected. It has accommodations for 2*25 
rils. The building is well heated, ventilated, and lighted 
gas and electricity. The assembly room has seating capa-7 
for the whole school and the three recitation rooms adling 
may be used for auditorium purposes by thrusting 
k the folding doors. The science laboratory is well 

An interesting feature of the system here is the grade meetings 
which are held in the fall months and also in the spring. 
On these occasions, teachers dismiss their grades and visit 
other grades to see class work of the same grade. After the 
class work, there is opportunity for discussion of methods, 
papers, etc. 

¦ The Nebraska City high school works for both the quality 
and the quantity of the work done. The aim has been to secure 
the best teachers available and to have the work done 
largely by departments. Thus a teacher has an opportunity 
to do special work in one line. In planning the courses for 
the high school, different classes of pupils have been kept 
in mind, both those who desire a general education and those 
who wish to attend higher institutions of learning. It is the 
policy of the school to inspire a love for higher education, 
and judging from the number of graduates who have won 
honors, we feel that we have been at least partially successful. 
As much freedom as possible is allowed pupils in the choice of 
their subjects and at the same time it is intended that their 

ork shall be well balanced and definite. </seg>

The school has taken a great interest in rhetoricals, consisting 
of orations, essays and debates delivered before the 
student body. The work is required of all. Credit is given 
for it. It shows in many ways. For several years Nebraska 
City has taken part in the Inter-High School debates held at 
Lincoln during the holidays. The students issue a high school 
monthly, "The Times- Anchor, " and this year published a year 
book or annual called "The Ripples. " This publication was 
gotten up in an attractive manner, beautified with many half 
tones and would have been a credit to a much larger high 
school. 

E athletics, foot ball and track athletics, Nebraska City does 
best but lately has been handicapped by the lack of good 
irial. 

Last spring, Nebraska City had representatives at the South- 
Eastern Nebraska Meet and also at the Missouri Valley Meet 
At St. Joseph. Allen C. Fling. 

NORFOLK 

The population of Norfolk has increased considerably the past 
two years if we may judge from the large number of new houses 
erected. The school population on the other hand has shown 
a decline of nearly half a hundred. As a consequence the 
number of teachers employed has likewise diminished. 

An agreeable contrast with this condition is the healthful 
growth of the High school, and the enthusiastic interest taken 
in higher education by pupils and patrons. 

With the exception of the introduction of elements of agriculture 
into the High school, no changes in the course of study 
have been made during the past two years. The work of the 
High school has been conservatively, but I believe in the main, 
substantially accomplished, as has been attested by reports of 
the proficiency of our students wno have entered the University. 
A few years ago the board of education passed a resolution 
that an examination in the common branches, equivalent 
to that required of candidates for a teachers' second grade 
certificate must be passed by pupils of the High school as a 
prerequisite for graduation. This requirement insures reasonable 
proficiency in these branches on the part of all members 
of the senior classes. The laboratory equipment has been 
much improved, and under the direction of Mr. P. E. McCoy </seg>

lias been made one of the strongest departments of the school. 

School libraries have received much attention during the 
past two years so that now, almost all the rooms in the schools 
ive small circulating libraries. The learning of classics by 
pils is another feature worthy of mention. Prom six to ten 
art selections are learned by each pupil annually. The 
omen's Club of our city has shown keen interest in the wel•e 
of the schools, co-operating in every way, and through 
trons' meetings awakening much interest. 

It is a pleasure to state that the financial situation here is 
greatly improving, and that in a short time, we expect to be 
entirely free from floating indebtedness. Thanks are due to 
the University and the State Department for helpful suggestions 
during the past two years. 

As a result of these suggestions and by reason of mutual cooperation, 
tone and vigor have been imparted to the educational 
sentiment of our community. D. C. O'Connor. 

NORTH PLATTE 

The schools of the city of North Platte have seen a steady 
growth during the two years since last report. There has 
been an increase in attendance of about ten per cent, and two 
additional teachers have been employed, the teaching force 
now numbering twenty three. Our new high school building 
was completed in January of last year at a cost of $30,000 and 
has enabled us to solve many of the problems that have confronted 
us in the past ten years. An entirely new and modern 
equipment in the way of text books has also been provided 
and we are making every effort toward keeping up to the times. 

The work in the high school has been broadened by the 
addition of German, American history, commercial law, zoology, 
trigonometry and a fourth year of English. There are 
now well equipped laboratories for individual work in chemistry, 
pnysics and biology. While our courses of study have 
been planned without direct reference to admission to the University, 
we are still in close touch with that part of the state's 
educational system, our accredited work amounting to tbirtv- 

six credits.

some degree of success in cultivating the habit of precise and 

accurate thinking. Algebra has been added to the work of 

the seventh and eighth grades with very gratifying results 

during the past year. The system of half-yearly intervals 

between grades has enabled us to adapt what might otherwise 

be a rigid course of study to the needs of the pupil whose work 

is faster or slower than the average. 

Permanence in office has contributed in no small degree to 

what measure of success we may have attained. Three- 

fourths of our teaching force have been here more than two 

years, and nearly half for five years or more. This fact to- 

gether with the support of a careful board of education who take 

deep interest in all that pertains to educational progress, makes 

us feel that the public is not losing confidence in its schools. 

There is thus reason to believe that our progress in the future 

will be greater than ever. Charles E. Barber.

Niqht School*. 

For the year now closed thuse schools were held in four 

buildings, instead of in only two, as was the case the year be- 

fore. The result was an enrollment much increased over the 

preceding year. The attendance, too, for the time the schools 

were in session, was considerably larger. Owing to unfortun- 

ate conditions, chiefly to the presence of certain contagious 

diseases in different parts of the city, the schools were not 

continued in session for the regular time, but were closed 

nearly a month early . 

In these schools the most serious problem is that of irregu- 

lar attendance. This is due to various causes, to nec»~ 

that pupils work on certain evenings, to weariness that pre- 

vents attendance on other evenings, to lack of reeular habits </seg>

any boys and girls, young men and young women, who 
i no other door open to them. They here get a better edum 
and are fitted to be more useful citizens than they othercould 
be. 

Irhe question whetherjor not an opportunity should be given 
these schools to take High school studies, is worthy of coneration. 
The plan would increase the attendance, and at 
) same time increase the cost of the schools. It would with- 
I doubt attract in considerable numbers a more stable and 
rular class of students, and their regularity and interest 
uld probably have an influence on the interest and regularity 
Attendance of those in the lower grades. 

The Nature Work. 

I-)r several years more or less nature work, more or less 
bing of the elements of natural history and the physical 
nces has been done in the schools. A more intelligent 
rest in this study has existed since four years ago, when 
teachers paid the expenses of a series of lessons, given 
n by Professors Bessey and Bruner of the University of 
raska. ou plants, birds, and insects Natural history has 
1 an especially interesting subject to both teachers and 
Us, and much first hand study, — study of plants and anis 
and their habits of growth and life, — has been done. 

Each teacher in the past selected her own subject matter and 
material and often took that which chance put in her way. 
While this fostered a very lively interest and much enthusiastic 
work it had at least one disadvantage, — it frequently happened 
that a child going from one grade or school to another found 
his class studying for the year the blue bird or the maple tree 
or cultivating sweet peas, when he observed and studied and 
talked and wrote much the previous year about blue birds or 
maple trees or sweet peas. 

To avoid this repetition or duplication of work a systematic 
arrangement was attempted last year, each grade having </seg>

assigned to it a certain bird and a certain tree for observation 
and study, and a flower and a common garden vegetable which 
they were to plant, cultivate, and rear to the proper point for 
use. For instance, the kindergartners were all to study the 
robin and the oak tree, and were to plant and raise nasturtiums 
and garden peas. The children of the fourth grade 
were assigned for study the ash tree and the wren, while for 
vegetables they raised radishes, beets and turnips, and for 
flower" poppies and zinnias. 

Ilach grade was assigned its work in the same way. 
ther teacher nor pupil was told what to find out about 
subjects of study, or how to raise the flower or vegetable 
ted for the grade. "Teacher and children went about it and 
lied out the thing together. 'The children in one way or 
ther got the seeds. They studied upon how the soil should 
prepared and when and how the seeds should be planted, 
s boys carried away the clay \)r unsuitable soil and brought 
i earth to put in its place. "All together planted the seeds 
watched for the plants to appear." Then the girls weeded 
trained them with the help of the boys. And all this vu 
e under the interested watchful oversight of the teacher. 

Last fall when the trees were in fruit or in the yellow leaf 
they were inspected, the leaves and characteristic twigs were 
drawn, the nuts gathered if the tree had them. In tbe spring 
the leaves were watched as they came out, tbe blossoming 
studied, and the fruit or the preparations for the fruit observed. 
Two or three times in the year the class went to one of the 
parks or to a grove or an orchard to find the bird or the tree. 

Only enough direction was given to tbe study to insure sew 
material for the work in each grade next year. Enough freedom 
was left so that teacher and pupil might have mm 
initiative and work out the study in their own way. 

Incidentally a good deal of botany and zoology were taught, 
for the teacher was not afraid to use a scientific term if it was 
a convenient thing to have. A habit of observing tbe inter— I 
ing growing things about was fostered, as was a friendly 
fellow feeling for the birds and small animals. An immense 
amount of the most valuable sort of material for use in oral 
and written language lessons was provided. A great hindrance

the children's minds, of suitable thoughts to express. This 
nature work has provided almost a superabundance of jostling 
thoughts and* information which the children are interested 
and eager to express. 

11 the doing of this work teachers as well as the children 
b taken the greatest interest. On every holiday teachers 
3 to be found in the parks and groves, often miles from 
r homes, in the gray dawn to find and study the ways and 
igs of their birds, and often, too, the children of the higher 
les were to be found there with them. An orchard in 
ch catbirds or bluebirds were found was a treasure, and 
wledge thereof was passed around for the benefit of all 
les studying those songsters, neither of which are too 
itiful hereabouts. 

ihousands of the children had little flower gardens or veg)le 
gardens at home. The effect in this way was marked 
&gt;ugtaout the city and was commented upon by parents and

Teachers' Lecture Course. 

For the third season the teachers last year conducted a 
successful lecture course. 

Eight numbers were given as follows : 

Lecture by "Josiah Flynt. "' 

A Symphony Orchestra Concert. 

Lecture, LoradoTaft. 

Lecture, Illustrated, Frank W. Robersou 

Lecture, Miss Clara Morris. 

Grand Concert. 

Illustrated Lecture on Liquid Air. 

Lecture, Hamilton W. Mabie. 

The four hundred teachers and about eight hundred of their 
friends enjoyed this course, which was of the highest quality. 
About $3,000 were expended on the course and the teachers 
enjoyed the satisfaction of having a small balance upon the 
right side of the ledger at the end of the season. </seg>

at that time one of the most magnificent new high school 
ses in the country and was noted throughout Mm length

n the western limit of the city and the high school proper 
lpied nearly all of one room, the other seventeen of the nigh 
i rooms which it originally contained being occupied bj the

h school had grown so that all the lower grades were re.ed 
from the building and the high school filling the entire

more than six hundred to seven hundred pupils, was

SCHUYLKK 

Some changes have taken place in the Schuyler schools 
since the last report. The enrollment has grown and the number 
of teachers has increased. Music, under a supervisor, has 
been in the school for years, but every year finds improvement. 
The library has been enlarged, and now attention is 
being given to school room decoration. While the purpose 
has been to follow a well balanced course, the teachers have 
done special work in composition and in reading. 

IPhe high school has been placed on a departmental basis, and 
paratus added in chemistry, physics, botany and zoology, 
e English course has been lengthened so that now there are 
o courses, each four years in length. The school has been 
jresented in athletics and debate, and has won state honors

SOUTH OMAHA 

Ke earliest recorded history of the South Omaha schools 
as follows :

i, and an enrollment for the first month of 200 puoils. " </seg>

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

During the year closing in June, 1902, there were enrolled 

in the public schools 4,401 pupils. The total expenditure for 
school purposes was $119,839, and the total value of district 
school property was $316,000. The more recent growth is 

shown by the following facts : 

There were enrolled at the close of the first month's school, 

September, 1902, 3,954 pupils. 

At corresponding time in 1901 3,728 pupils 

At corresponding time in 1900 3.572 pupils 

At corresponding time in 1899 3,230 pupils 

At corresponding time in 1898 2,463 pupils 

There were, in 1900, ninety-seven teachers on the regular 

list; 104 in 1901, and now 110 teachers are already employed 
and more will evidently be needed when the excessive rush at 

South Omaha's chief industry subsides a little. 

A peculiar feature of the South Omaha schools is the rela- 

tively small number of pupils enrolled in the High school as 
compared with those in the grades. This is partly due to 
the lack of any adequate High school building; a want which 
all friends of the schools hope will soon be supplied. The 
chief cause is evidently due to the very general disposition in 
this great industrial center to "go to work" after completing 

the eighth grade, or even much earlier. 

A careful comparison of the enrollment in the public and pa- 

rochial schools of the city with the census showed that there 
were in the city last year 1,600 pupils between the ages of 

tven and fourteen who were not enrolled in the above schools. 
There are at present 940 pupils in our first grade, 145 in our 

eighth grade and thirty-three in our twelfth grade. 
Our schools are at present accommodated in nine large brick 

EUdings, one combined briok and frame, and three frame 
ildings. South Omaha erects about one school building a 
ir, and it is hoped that an ample High school Duilding, 
»dern in all its appointments, will next appear and thus sup- 

ply the most urgent need. 

It ii a hopeful sign that almost the entire corps of last year's 

teacher* were re-elected, and many of these have shown commendable 
energy in making further special preparation for 

their work. J. A. McLean. </seg>

SUTTON 

Ehat may be said in a general way of many other schools 
be said of our schools. The teachers are capable and prosive; 
the board of education composed of good business 
; the patrons interested, and a good healthy growth evident. 

One of the problems now confronting us is the use of our 
library books. The books are new, well selected and with 
additions now being made will number- over 600. However, it 
is not the increase in number that most concerns us. It is 
their use. And the following is something of the beginning 
of our effort: Classified lists of all books are posted in each 
room. Each teacher acts as librarian and adviser in her own 
room. To facilitate handling of books the library is divided into 
four divisions: High School, Grammar, Intermediate and Primary, 
and books for each division located near that department. 
Teachers are urged to make themselves acquainted with books 
in their own department. Passages of the more important books 
are read by the teachers to the pupils. Careful reading on the 
part of the pupil is encouraged by giving credit in English 
upon written evidence of the kind and amount of work done. 
Lists of books to be thus read and studied are posted in the 
class rooms. The reference books are made use of in the 
grades for nature study, picture study, language, history and 
geography, etc. Magazines are being collected and classified 
to aid in this work. E. Clippinger.

Irhe past two years have not witnessed a full realization uf 
our ideals, but the persistent efforts of an interested board

t failed to make some substantial gains toward the desired 

One object of our labors has been to strengthen the grades. 
This baa been accomplished partly by the matter in the course 
of study, and partly through the greater effort and ability of 
the teachers. Believing that one of the greatest needs uf our 
grade pupils is higher ideals in life, we have attempted to 
satisfy this need by a carefully planned course in biography to 
give them examples of character, and a course in literary 
selections to furnish them with food for reflection and precepts </seg>

for direction. This course extends from the first grade 
through the eighth. 

In the high school the course of study has been made comtelv^ 
elective — that is, there are no "standards," but the 
ttflf of selection is under the supervision of the parents and 
chers. Our second year's trial of this plan has furnished 
with no desire to return to the straight- jacket system. 

Our historical and scientific laboratories have been greatly 
improved, our source library especially being quite well supplied. 


Our greatest hope lies in the character of the teachers. 
Regular meetings are held once a week. Some study is always 
pursued throughout the* year. The majority of them each 
year do summer work at home or in some institution of learning. 
The spirit of co-operation and individual interest in the 
welfare of the whole school prevails. 

The board of education are careful in the selection of new 
teachers, and make every reasonable effort to keep those who 
are found worthy. Longer terms of service and higher wages 
are the tendencies.

modern number work, source study history, laboratory work 
in all sciences, and systematic instruction in music are among 
some of the more prominent new features of the course. In 
addition to the required work of the high school, pupils are 
given the opportunity to take work in any of the following, 
provided all regular work is done well : — parliamentary law, 
advanced business practice in bookkeeping and newspaper 
reporting and advanced composition. Special training is 
given those of the"adyauced students who intend to enter the 
profession of teaching. The homely motto with which all 
pupils are impressed is, "Mind your own business," for there 
is no inspiration like that which springs from sticking to a 
task with the right attitude towards school and work. 

The school has a general library of over 1200 volumes, with 
briefer reference libraries in physics, chemistry, mathematics, 
botany, pedagogy, and history. A laboratory fitted up with 
first class apparatus and appliances is maintained for individual 
work in physics, chemistry, botany, and physiology. 

The Board of Education, by resolutions of approval and in 
person, stand loyally back of the teachers, and the kindliest of 
personal and professional relations prevail between teachers 
and members of the Board. The teachers have all been 
inspired to attend summer training schools, or otherwise to 
improve themselves in study, professional work, and travel. 
They cooperate heartily and voluntarily with the county superintendent 
in attending and in participating in the several 
section meetings of the county. 

Among our special school activities are athletics, joint 
debates, and special musical and literary work. 

I'oot ball, base ball, basket ball, tennis, and light gymnastics 
carried on systematically under trainers. As a result of 
ket ball contests last year alone over one hundred volumes 
choice literature were added to the school library, and 
nty dollars worth of classic pictures were added to the 
ool room decorations. For three years an indoor gymnan 
in addition to out-door courts, has been maintained as a 
'-supporting institution. Play ground games are all under 
jperative supervision. Over $250 worth of playground and 
nnasium apparatus is now the property of the schools, $150 
'th having been donated by the Wahoo Gymnasium Asso;ion 
without solicitation. </seg>

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

In joint debates with other high schools oar pupils have 
been inspired to greater effort. Special musical and literary 
programs are given in all departments on special occasions, 
such work being made to inspire rather than to hinder. 
During the past year the Senior class gave a mid-year "Public" 
which gave them special training for the final work of the year. 
Through all the student activities the aim is to encourage a 
feeling of individual responsibility, and to develop the incipient 
instincts of leadership. The results so far have been a 
series of surprises in revealing unsuspected talents and 
ambitions. 

One of the most satisfactory features of our course is the 
music work. This work was introduced three years ago, and 
has been closely directed by a special supervisor. A grammar 
school chorus, a boys' octet, a girls' three-part chorus, and a 
high school chorus now furnish music for the county educational 
association, for commencement, and for the local churches 
upon invitation. J. W. Searson. 

WEST POINT 

K'he West Point public schools are organized under subision 
XIV of the school laws of Nebraska, and employ a 
corps of eleven teachers. Eight of these do the work of the 
graded school and three including the superintendent instruct 
in the four grades of the high school. 

Ehe qualifications of teachers are passed upon by an examg 
board, consisting of Miss Charlotte Crawford as chairi, 
and Messrs. J. F. Losch and O. C. Anderson as associate 
members. The individuals comprising this board are college 
graduates or have had some experience in actual school work, 
and are selected because of their scholarship, or interest in and 
knowledge of school systems. A diploma from th« State University, 
a State Certificate, or their equivalent is usually 
accepted in lieu of an examination. The experience of the 
past few years has proved that those without college or normal 
training are seldom able to pass this examination, and the 
standard of excellence among the teaching force is a part of 
the current comment concerning the schools. 

The school district is one of the most prosperous and thrifty 
communities of Nebraska. The school is free from debt, and

standard and latest books on fiction, and those for

™ While the high school has twenty-nine points of credit at 
the State University, it recognizes the needs of those desiring 
to teach, and places special emphasis on the common or normal 
branches. The faculty act as a unit in studying and putting 
into practice the latest methods on teaching the various subjects 
of English. The Correction Manual lately issued by 
Superintendent E. B. Sherman is placed in the hands of every 
pupil from the seventh to the twelfth grades. This plan 
largely aids in unifying the English work and constantly keeps 
before the pupil, for a term of years, one single purpose — 
excellence in the use of English and the best manner of attaining 
that end. Rhetoricals are a part of the required work to 
obtain credit for English in the high school. A literary 
society under the direction of the high school teachers, meets 
regularly where the pupils render their selections after having 
been carefully drilled and criticised. 

Khe West Point school board is chosen from the leading 
"essional and business men of the town. 

Good wages, liberal appropriations for school supplies, and 
retaining good teachers for a long term of years are some of 
the characteristic policies of the board. The erection of a

YORK 

I?he hierh school literary societies form an interesting part 
York school life. The Lyceum League of America is the 
ne of the boys' organization. It meets at Fraternal Hall 
iry Monday afternoon at 2 :30 and devotes an hour and a 
f to debates and other exercises in public speaking. The 
Is' societies, called the N. N. 8. and the V. V. A. , meet in 
tarate rooms of the high school building at the same hour, 
sept once a month when they have a joint program in 
assembly room. Once every quarter a union meeting of 
i three societies is held in the evening. In addition to the 
literary work done in these societies, two members of the senior 
class deliver short addresses every Thursday morning and 
a corresponding period Friday is given to volunteer declamations, 
musical selections and discussions of current events. 

The ages of our high school pupils range from fourteen to 
twenty-one. The state superintendent and other visitors have 
commented upon the maturity of the pupils and some have 
inquired the cause. The sentiment of the community in the 
matter of keeping the older pupils in school and the encouragement 
given to athletics doubtless has much to do with this. 
But the result is chiefly due, I think, to the policy adopted by 
Supt/Corbett in requiring pupils to remain in the first grade 
two'years and insisting that none should be advanced until the 
work of the grade had been mastered. Since his time, the 
kindergarten has been added and it now requires a pupil ten 
years to roach the high school if advanced a grade each year. 
Tin- average age of our graduates is generally a little over 
nineteen. Whatever may be the cause of this high average, it 
is rav deliWenite judgment that it \a the most valuable feature

STATE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTE &gt; 

UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA, LINCOLN 

Ehe University has added nothing to its lands this year, 
need for larger quarters here in the city will soon be Dressthough 
it is not so at this moment. A more immediate 
for land is heard from the farm where, large as the presestate 
is. still ampler areas are required that agricultural 
hing and experimentation may go on strongly. 

I to buildings have been erected the last year except the 
v stock barn at the farm. There is imperative necessity 
two additional buildings at the farm. It is nothing short of 
elty to require the department of physics to toil longer 
hout any place wholly its own either for lecturing, for 
terimentation or for the proper storing of apparatus. The 
ue of our physical apparatus, reasonably abundant and 
ch of it very costly, is diminished several per cent each 
r by imperfect storage and the necessity for transporting 
ces from place to place for use in teaching. No one of the 
ineerinsr departments has sufficient premises. The shops 
too small. The important department of domestic art and 
mce is forbidden to enlarge for lack of space. 

The buildings have been kept in the best repair possible with 
the limited resources at the disposal of the university, bat 
repairs are badly needed which it is impossible to effect at 
present for lack of funds. Such economy is viciously costly. 
The friends of the state ought to insist that wasteful management 
of this sort be henceforth rendered unnecessary. There 
ought to be money to make efficient repairs immediately in 
every case where the need of repairs arises. That is what 
private owners of first-class business plants always do. Sound 
economy on behalf of the state would supply the regents with 
funds to effect repairs upon this precious property as promptly 
and as completely as the Burlington road does upon its engines </seg>

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

I site of poverty something has been accomplished in imring 
the appearance of the University premises. The 
etic association has conferred a benediction by putting up 
w grand stand and a new fence about the athletic field. In 
iring neatness on the campus faculty and students have corated 
admirably. 

I he teaching force of the university has the past year 
ered few changes. One eminent dean and a valued professor 
us a year ago. I refer to Edgren and Brooks, who 
jpted eligible positions elsewhere at salaries which we could 
match. Several other professors have received calls to 
re us at higher salaries, but have declined. The work done 
the teaching force has been hard, faithful and efficient, 
members have wrought in perfect harmony and co-oper&gt; 
— one of the most delightful features connected with the 
vice of the university. 

The student body has been characterized by almost universal 
seal in work. University spirit has improved. Pew students 
have been ill and, so far as I know, but Oiie has died. Our 
athletic and debating successes are known to all. The conduct 
of our students is about all that could be desired. There 
have been a few cases of cheating in written work, which, of 
course, according to a university code of morals, io almost unpardonable 
sin. If this vice does not abate greater severity 
will have to be exercised in dealing with it. It may even be 
necessary to treat it as absolutely unpardonable. When taxed 
with this fault students nearly always say it is common and 
not frowned on very seriously in the high schools where they 
prepared. This is unfortunate if true. Perhaps the question 
of its truth is worth investigating. 

Annoying thefts occur at intervals in various departments of 
the university. Some of the thieves are no doubt outsiders, 
but not all. Thief-students do not, I believe, learn their vice 
here, but we ought to be able to make them unlearn it here. 
Clear cases of such delinquency should \ be severely punished. 

Spite of all this the moral tone of our student body is higher 
than that at any other institution with which I have been 
connected. Of course, being a state university, supported by 
general taxation, we cannot teach dogma or side with any 
ecclesiastical organization against any other. When people, </seg>

however, allege that the university does nothing to advance 
the interests of religion I always protest. All preachers, 
all evangelists, all churchmen, such, even, as go furthest in 
emphasizing rites, forms and ecclesiasticism, boastfully maintain 
that the very best means which can be used to propagate 
religion is the influence of noble and upright character. It 
would perhaps be invidious to compare the influence of the 
faculty and students of our university in this regard with the 
corresponding influence exerted at other schools, but could 
such a comparison be made and made fairly, the result would, 
I am sure, convince all that there is in exercise in this university 
a most powerful, an almost incomparable force for the creation 
and dissemination of the best results prayed for by all 
Christian people. 

Eis remarkable that the number of studeuts connected with 
university continues to grow. Falling off might have been 
jcted from the following causes: 

Iirst, the growth of private colleges in the state. Socond, 
fees which the university has had to impose on all students 
ttg to the too small sum received the last time from the 
e. Third, the tuition which, partly for the same reason, 
eas thought well to require from non-resident students, 
rth, the main cause, I believe, the advance in the cost of 
ag last and this year over that of previous years. I sups 
that the most economical student in the university has 
i obliged to lay out for living expenses at the very least 
q $25 to $50 more the last year than was necessary the year 

These causes, it will be observed, are likely to continue. It 
will be necessary, therefore, for the friends of the university 
by their exertions to counteract and overcome these adverse 
causes named, to set in exercise, that is, other forces stronger 
than these which might check our growth. 

Teachers of the state who wish to prosecute further study are 
given an opportunity to take special work in the summer session 
and during the collegiate year. Those who are not able to press 
on and secure a degree find a year's work with the excellent 
library and laboratory facilities invaluable. Teachers appreciate 
the encouragement to further study received from the 
university and many of the boards of education in our city </seg>

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

schools are co-operating' by allowing to tbeir teachers leave of 
absence for one year for this purpose. 

tit is probably known that recently the regents have partly 
rough affiliation with the Omaha Medical College established 
in the university a College of Medicine. The first two of the 
four years of instruction will be given in Lincoln and the last 
two taken up with more technical study, clinical work, and so 
on, in Omaha. This is considered a very important new step. 
It cannot fail of telling results, chief among which will be elevation 
in the quality of medical and surgical knowledge and 
practice throughout the Missouri valley. The College of 
«edicine will pay all its own expenses, like the Law college at 
esent, not being in any sense a burden upon the university 
est. 

It may be possible in the course of a few years to erect a 
College of Engineering on a similar basis, affixing certain fees 
to the excellent instruction given in that department so that 
the university treasury may be richer by the sums now necessary 
to keep up such teaching. This, it seems to me, would 
be only just, inasmuch as no students are surer than those 
schooled in engineering of lucrative employment on leaving 
the university. 

It may not be inappropriate to indicate at this point a few 
of the principles which ought to govern a state university 
in shaping its teaching work. No university in the world can 
teach literally all things. None can teach all the subjects 
which it would be desirable to teach were it possible. All 
universities must therefore make choice what among intrinsically 
desirable branches they will endeavor to offer, and this choice 
is at once more imperative and more difficult in proportion to 
the financial limitations of the institution in question. In a 
state university, particularly in a new state, the problem is 
a very difficult one. As a first step towards its solution, 
let us try to imagine a universal universitv and then block out 
into four great classes the branches of learning which such an 
institution would name in its curricula. These would be: 

1. Studies which lie at the basis of high general intelligence 
and are not recondite at all. Here would come, in this 
state, courses in writing and speaking English, in English 
Literature, in foreign languages mainly modern, in political </seg>

            <seg id="p368">
945 

EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS. 

economy and finance, in ordinary mathematics, in geography, 
in art, in history, particularly that of the United States, and 
so on. 

12. Studies more technical in character, fundamentally reting 
to the political and industrial life of the state. Under 
is class would come political and social science, the highest 
athematics subsidiary to any branch of physics or astronomy, 
so deep chemistry, deep physics, everything relating to 
engineering, manufacturing, teaching, and so on. 
at only the discovered and certain scientific facts under these 
teguries must be taught, but inquiries must be pressed in all 
hopeful new directions, these investigations no less than exposition 
in ratified science being part and parcel of university work 
under this head. 

3. Subjects which a considerable number of youth will wish 
to know to fit them for some sort of life which they may choose 
outside of the state. In this compass will come not a few studies 
which, though having no direct relation to the industries of the 
state, it is desirable for the state to teach, since the state 
ought to provide so far as possible for the thorough education 
I all its children even if they elect to live elsewhere. Under 
s head would come the philological history of the English 
igue, several studies in art and in literature, deep acquaint-•e 
with all the more important foreign languages, ancient 
i modern, and so on. 

E. Studies having little apparent relation either to the life 
the state or to the necessity of any uf its citizens, although 
aortant to human intelligence at large. Here would come 
1 more recondite studies in language, the Semitic languages, 
o Sanskrit, in fact the whole of general philology as related 
the less known and less important languages spoken by 
d. Here would come also speculative mathematics and phi 
aphy and the history of these, with a great deal else which 
men will always and properly wish to study, which all believe, 
Kreover, to hold a more or less important relation to the life 
the human mind, though its exact value is very difficult to 

It seems to me that a state university ought to expand its 
curriculum along the path of increasing reconditeness indicated 
by this classification, postponing the studies in group 2 </seg>

            <seg id="p369">
946 

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

until those of group 1 are amply provided for. postponing 

those of 3 until those of 2 are doing well, and leaving those of 

4 until those of all the three earlier sets are supplied. 
Any one applying this law to our own situation would say, I 

think that as soon as may be, a few new departments ought to 

be added to our repertoire in order to make it rational and 

self -consistent. 

To the work now doing in domestic science there should be 

added as soon as possible corresponding work in domestic art. 

Ample courses in commercial economics, geography and meth- 

ods should be instituted. A year or two of hard and first class 

work in architecture should be offered, and the courses which 

the Greek department, straining its resources is at present 

offering in its history and criticism of fine arts, should be 

erected into an independent professorship. The excellent 

course in forestry already arranged should be promulgated at 

once and strongly carried through.

THE STATE NORMAL SCHOOL, PERU 

Origin and Design ot the Sfhix&gt;t. 

In providing for the education of her youth Nebraska 
planned from the first for the training of teachers for her 
public schools, and the State Normal school dates its origin in 
the year of the admission of the State into the Union. The </seg>

school was designed by its founders to be an integral part of 
the public school system with a perfectly definite function, 
explicitly stated in the statute in the following language: 
"The exclusive purpose of this school is the training 
and instruction of persons, both male and female, in the 
arts of teaching and managing schools, and in the principles 
and practices of the various branches of learning taught in our 
public schools." • It is strictly a proft'ssiotml school, organized 
and conducted for the sole purpose of fitting teachers for efficient 
service in the common schools of the state. 

Material Ikjuipment. 

The school buildings, consisting of Normal Hall (the main 
recitation and administration building), the Library, the Greenhouse, 
the Power house, Mount Vernon Hall (the ladies' dormitory), 
and the Observatory, are situated on an eminence 
overlooking the Missouri river, in a grove of oak and elm. 
The grounds comprise sixty acres of native forest trees, and 
the campus is unsurpassed for natural beauty. 

The north wing of Normal Hall was erected in 1872 at a cost 
of $28,000; and the large south wing, containing the present 
Chapel, the laboratories, some additional recitation rooms, and 
the administrative offices, was added in 1hs5 at a cost of 20,-000. 
The Library building, a frame structure costing $15,000, 
was built in 1877 ;ani the Power-house, containing the heating 
and lighting plant and the recently fitted up physical culture 
room, was built in the same year. The Greenhouse, an import 
ant accessory of the biological department of the school, was 
built in 1901 by subscriptions from citizens, faculty, and 
students. Mount Vernon Hall was originally built in 1866 by 
subscriptions of citizens amounting to $H,000, and was given to 
the State when the Normal school was established a year later. 
In 1869 the L3gislature appropriated $10,000 for completing 
and improving this building. It was destroyed by fire in 
January, 1897, and was rebuilt in the same year as a modern 
dormitory, at a cost of $20,009. Improvements are being made 
constantly in this building from the proceeds of the rental of 
rooms. 

Ehere have been many important changes in the material 
ipment of the school in the past biennium;in fact, more 
manent improvements have been made in the buildings and </seg>

grounds than in the ten years preceding. The campus has 
been enlarged to more than double its former size, by adding 
to it the beautiful grove lying on the south border. In the 
natural amphitheater formed by the hills in this new part of 
the campus the last two commencements have been held. The 
heating and lighting plant has been entirely remodeled; a new 
boiler has been added, a new electric light dynamo of double 
the capacity has replaced the old one, a new switch-board with 
needed accessories has been installed, and the main building 
has been entirely rewired. A new water-main has been laid 
from the pumping station to the standpipe; new fire hose has 
been purchased ; and a drinking fountain has been placed in 
the main hallway. New brick walks have been laid in the 
grounds, replacing the old wooden ones; and the drainage and 
sewerage system has been reconstructed. A large room over 
the power-house has been celled and plastered and fitted up 
for the use of classes in vocal music and physical culture. 
Bath rooms with hot and cold water and other modern conveniences 
have been provided upon each floor of Mount Vernon 
Hall, and many minor improvements have been made in the 
fitting and furnishing of this home for young ladies. New 
floors have been laid in many of the rooms of the main school 
building; a new kindergarten room has been equipped; and 
new furniture purchased for some of the rooms. The reading 
room of the library has been enlarged and new stacks provided 
for books; a card catalogue has also been added. An ice-house 
has been built, with a storage capacity for ice for the drinking 
fountains throughout the institution. A new greenhouse has 
been built and equipped with plants. An athletic field has 
been laid out and graded; basket ball grounds have been 
provided ; and the tennis grounds enlarged. 

While the period of the last two years has been one of constant 
growth, the school is still seriously cramped and hindered 
in its proper development by lack of adequate equipment. 
The need of new buildings is eve a more imperative than it 
was two years ago. The present chapel is not large enough 
to accommodate the students in their daily assembly; and it is 
impossible to hold commencement exercises and other public 
meetings of the school in this room — hence it was found 
necessary at each of the last two commencements to hold the </seg>

meetings on the campus. The laboratories, both physical and 
biological, are so crowded as to render satisfactory teaching 
very difficult. The room occupied by the physical culture 
-es is wholly unsuited for such use, both by size and 
method of construction. If a suitable chapel building were 
provided, it would be possible at a slight cost so to reconstruct 
the present building as to relieve all of this pressure for room. 
A new library building is demanded, not only to house properly 
the valuable collection of books belonging to the. school 
but also to protect the state against loss by fire. The library 
of the Nebraska State Normal school is fourth in size among 
the Normal school libraries of America and is among the very 
first in quality. This valuable and rapidly growing collection 
of books, amounting at present to 15,000 volumes, is in a frame 
building, subject constantly to danger from fire. It is simply 
a matter of good business management on the part of the state 
to provide a modern fireproof building for these books. The 
library is also robbed of much of its value by the crowded 
condition of the stacks and the reading room. Th-re is no 
longer shelf room for the new books added; and the readingroom 
is much too small to accommodate the students using the 

In order to equip properly its Normal school the state should 
provide for it two additional buildings; a new chapel building 
with a seating capacity for fifteen hundred students, and a 
library building so planned as to provide for the library for 
some years to come. These two buildings were granted by 
the last Legislature by an almost unanimous vote — seventyfive 
to eight in the House of Representatives, and twenty-live 
to five in the Senate. This appropriation so generously voted 
by the Legislature, after hearing the reports of its committees 
who had visited the school and informed themselves as to its 
conditions and needs, was vetoed by the Governor; and for two 
years the school has struggled on* against the limitations of 
inadequate equipment, in the assurance that 'the justice of its 
claim would be properly recognized. Certainly Nebraska will 
do for its Normal school what it has done so well for its 
University ; for its Normal school stands in more vital relation 
to its common schools than any other institution in 
the state. The State Normal school is the professional head </seg>

            <seg id="p374">
951 


of the state school system, and in no other way can the 
common district school be more surely improved than through 
enlarging and strengthening the work of the Normal school. 
Nebraska's Normal school should rank, as her University 
ranks, among the great public schools of the Union: and it 
will so rank when she equips her Normal school a.-, she has 
equipped her University. The property which the state owns 
at Peru is too valuable to be hindered from its proper function 
by the lack of the additional equipment which the school now 
asks. As I pointed out in my report to your office two years 
ago, "The question of the establishment of additional Normal 
schools at other points in the state is not necessarily involved 
in the consideration of the claim of the school at Peru. 
Whether another school is located at some other point in the 
state or not, it is still true that the natural growth of the school 
at Peru will render the desired buildings absolutely necessary. " 
The attendance at Peru will in any event continue to grow, 
and the new buildings are required to meet even the present 
needs of the school. 

Organ izatimi of the St-hixtl. 

The curriculum of the school has been revised in the last 
two years, with a view to a more consistent arrangement of 
the subjects of study and a better adaptation to the educational 
conditions and needs of Nebraska. The complete curriculum 
comprises five years of thirty-six weeks each, extending from 
the ninth grade to about a year and a half beyond the work of 
the best high schools. The first year is devoted to a 
critical review of the common branches, comprising all the 
subjects reauired for a third grade certificate. Strong eighth 
grade students are admitted to the lowest class ; and graduates 
of the school are admitted to the Sophomore year of the University 
with some extra credits. Credit is given for all equivalent 
academic work done in other schools properly equipped 
for doing work of an equal grade; and mature students are 
admitted to such advanced standing as they are entitled to by 
their previous study. But little opportunity is given for 
elective work or the substitution of other studies for those 
prescribed in the regular curriculum, since the design of the 
school and the limitation of the number of teachers in the 
-acuity make such choice of study impracticable; however, </seg>

            <seg id="p375">
952 

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

students who have anticipated elsewhere a part of the prescribed 
work of any year are permitted to substitute in place 
of such work studies for which they have special tastes and 
aptitudes. 

To meet the needs of graduates of high schools with strong 
four-year courses and other students of equal scholarship a 
special adaptation is made of the last two years of the regular 
curriculum, incorporating into them some subject from the 
previous years of the curriculum and omitting others in which 
these students have already had good previous instruction. 
The effect of this abridgment of the full curriculum is to provide 
a strong two-years' course for high school graduates. 
A similar adaptation of the work in the Junior and Senior 
years is made for those who wish to prepare for Kindergarten 
teaching. Those completing these two special abridgments of 
the curriculum are graduated upon the same conditions and 
with the same professional recognition as students completing 
the regular curriculum. 

E addition to the regular work of the school leading to the 
ma and the life certificate, there has been organized in 
'dance with the law establishing the school, a "Common 
School Course," leading to a two years' elementary certificate. 
This course is designed to prepare teachers for the country. 
rols and for the primary and grammar grades of village 
town schools in a shorter time than would be required to 
complete the full curriculum. Strong eighth grade pupils 
may enter this course directly and complete it in two years. 
It provides a thorough review of the common branches and introduces 
the student to such advanced studies as will most aid 
him in his work of teaching in the schools in which he was so 
lately a pupil. The academic study is supplemented by a full 
year of practical study of methods of instruction and management 
under the guidance of expert teachers. The State Normal 
school has no more import int work than tnat of this "common 
school course." While it is not in any sense a substitute 
for the full curriculum leading to the life certificate, it brings 
practical normal training within the reach of ambitious young 
men and women whose means will not permit them to enter at 
once upon a longer course of preparation for their work. Students 
who have completed ten grades or more of public school </seg>

            <seg id="p376">

EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS. 

work, or teachers of some experience may complete this course 
in one year. A special adaptation of this short curriculum 
is made to meet the needs of high school graduates, consisting 
of a critical study of the common branches upon the basis of 
their high school preparation and a continuance of elective 
and secondary subjects. 

The Model School. 

The Model school of the State Normal school &gt;s a well organized 
graded school, including a kindergarten and the eight 
grades of a common school. The children in the model school 
are admitted from the homes in Peru, paying a small tuition 
charge for the privilege of attending the school. This tuition 
fund is expended in the equipment and administration of the 
school. The management and instruction are under the immediate 
direction of a superintendent, who is also in charge of the 
grammar grades. She is assisted by a supervisor of the work 
in the intermediate grades, a supervisor of primary instruction, 
a kindergarten teacher, and a model grade teacher. Other 
members of the Normal school faculty also teach and direct 
work in their special lines, such as the teachers of vocal music, 
penmanship, physical culture, etc. The instruction in the 
Model school is continuous from the tirst year of the kindergarten 
up through the eight grades of the elementary public 
schools ; and pupils completing the eighth grade of the Model 
school are admitted to the first year of the Normal school. 

While the Model school, as seen from the standpoint of the 
patrons and their children, is an ideal public school in which 
the welfare and development of the children is the aim in 
every teaching act, it is also the correlating center about 
which all the work of the Normal school is grouped and organized. 
It is a pedagogical laboratory in which the experiments 
are carefully planned and executed teaching acts, to be 
judged by their results in the lives of the children taught. In 
the Model school of the Nebraska State Normal school prospective 
teachers study the art of teaching through the observation 
of expert teachers engaged in actual school work, and 
they also in the later years of their course are permitted to try 
their apprentice hands under the close and sympathetic guidance 
of these same artist teachers. </seg>

Tenure of Offin&gt; of Teacher* and Ern/iloyees. 

Doubtless the most important change in the management of 
the school in recent years was made by the Board of Education 
last April in the matter of the tenure of office of teachers and 
other employees. Ever sinue the establishment of the school, 
more than a third of a century ago, all appointments have been 
for a term of one year only, and all contracts, whether with 
teachers or janitors, expired by limitation at the close of each 
school year. The ''annual election of teachers" usually 
occurred at the commencement season, and brought into the 
school among the teachers and frequently among the students 
a feeling of unrest and destructive doubt as to the future, 
that worked yearly much injury to the school. Even the old 
and well established members of the faculty were affocted as 
the "votes of their friends" were needed to secure the election 
of some new aspirant for a place in the force of teachers and 
employees. The Principal's right to nominate sometimes degenerated 
into a mere obligation to preserve a balance between 
conflicting claims for the best general result. It was difficult, 
practically impossible, to plan for any continuous constructive 
work with a faculty who felt that they were but piece workers 
year by year. 

At the annual meeting in April, 1901, in his report to the 
Board of Education the Principal recommended that some 
action be taken to secure more permanency in the organized 
life of the school, with the result that the custom of annual 
elections was abolished. Acting under the authority conferred 
by statute the Board appointed all teachers and employees 
chosen at that time to permanent— or indefinite — positions, 
subject to efficient service. The effect of this action has been 
beneficial in a marked degree. 

Terms of Admiukm. 

To enter the State Normal school a student is required to have 
a fair knowledge of the common school branches such as may be 
obtained in the country schools^or in the lower eight grades of 
well organized city schools ; and by a recent decision of the 
State Superintendent of Public Instruction the "Common 
School Diploma" issued by County Superintendents to those 
completing successfully the eighth grade work in the distric </seg>

school shall be accepted as evidence of such qualifications 
without further examination. A person who holds a valid 
teacher's certificate of first or second grade from any county 
or city of Nebraska, or a diploma of graduation from a Nebraska 
High school of at least two full years' work above the eighth 
grade may also bs admitted without examination. Entrance 
examinations are given at the school where satisfactory evidence 
of the student's fitness to do the prescribed work in the 
school cannot be otherwise obtained. An applicant for admission 
to the State Normal school must be fourteen years of 
age, of good moral character, and of good physical health. 
Advanced standing will be granted at the discretion of the 
faculty upon approved credentials or examination. 

fa entering the school for the first time a student matricus 
by filling out a matriculation blank and paying a fee of 
dollars, which entitles him to life membership in the school, 
regularly matriculated students living in Nebraska are 
entitled to the advantages and privileges of the school free of 
tuition. Persons from other states may be admitted upon the 
same conditions as those residing in the State, subject to a 
tuition charge of ten dollars per year. 

Graduation and Certification. 

The school issues three grades of certificates: the Elementary 
Certificate, the Diploma, and the Life Certificate. The 
Elementary Certificate is given on the completion of "the 
common school course," as it is designated by law, and is good 
for two years in any part of the state. The Diploma given 
to persons completing the full curriculum, entitles "the holder 
to teach in any of the schools of the state without further 
examination for the space of three years. " Graduates from 
the full curriculum of the school are entitled to the Life Certificates 
after two years' successful experience in teaching in 
the public schools of the state. The minimum time required 
for obtaining a certificate of any grade from the State Normal 
school has been fixed by the State Superintendent of Public

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

evidently a growing disposition on the part of the county 
superintendents, city superintendents and principals to seek 
expert assistance in finding good teachers; and their applications 
addressed to the school have been for many more teachers 
than the school has) been able to furnish. In general these 
applications are for teachers for particular places, stating 
definitely the qualifications desired. While it is to be regretted 
that in many cases the school has had no one to nominate for 
the position, it is very gratifying to be able to meet in so large 

a measure these legitimate demands upon the school. A 
Normal school, like a manufacturing establishment, finds the 
reward for good work in the demand for its product: and certainly 
there is satisfactory evidence that Nebraska's Normal 
school is constantly spreading its influence for good throughoat 
the state. 

The Student Body. 

In the last biennium there have been 1062 different students 
enrolled in the Normal school, representing 69 counties of the 
state. Nemaha county has had naturally the largest representation 
; Douglas county stands second ; then follow, in order, Otoe, 
Richardson, Lancaster, Johnson, Saline, Gage, Butler, Cass. 
Forty-seven counties were represented by five or more students ; 
23 had ten or more : and 13 had twenty or more. The more 
numerous representation was not confined to eastern counties 
adjacent to the school; Frontier county in the far southwest 
sent 14 students, and Knox on the northern border sent 20. 
Of the 21 counties not represented in the enrollment in the 
biennium, 10 were represented in the years immediately preoeding; 
also of these 21 counties, 8 were without representatives 
in the State University for the same two years. The 
relation which the attendance from the various counties bears 
to the number of teachers employed in their schools is a significant 
fact, throwing some light upon the value of the work 
which the school is doing for the public schools of the state. 
In 49 counties the attendance in the biennium was more than 
five per cent of the whole number of teachers required for the 
schools of the county each year ; in 22 counties it was more 
than ten per cent of the required number; and in 6 counties, it 
was more than twenty per cent. The average enrollment in </seg>

the school each year is more than six per cent of the whole 
number of teachers required in the schools of the state. 

An examination of the records of the school for the third of 
a century of its existence shows that more than 7000 teachers 
have been trained for the public schools of the state. Of this 
number 11 counties have received 100 or more each; 9 counties 
have had between 50 and 100; 16 counties have had between 25 
and 50; and 43 counties have had less than 25 each. In considering 
the significance of this record it is important to remember 
that one-fourth of the present 90 counties of Nebraska had 
no existence prior to 1880. 

IVhile the students in the State Normal school are sufficiently 
ture to profit by the training which the school offers, they 
i still young enough to prepare enthusiastically for efficient 
vice in the schools of the state. The average age of the 
dents in the biennium was 19; of the Senior class 22; the 
ingest student was 13, and the oldest was 35 years of age. 
out one-fourth of those in attendance were young men. 
re than twenty -five percent were high school graduates; 
I more than thirty per cent had taught before entering the 

The Summer Term. 

The summer school is now a permanent feature of the State 
Normal school. It is designed to meet the wants of two 
classes of students: Those in the regular course who are 
able by thus lengthening the school year to reduce the number 
of years required for completing the work, and teachers and 
prospective teachers who wish in a short term to get a more 
thorough knowledge of the branches to be taught and an acquaintance 
with normal methods of instruction and management. 
The work has been carefully adapted to the educational 
needs of Nebraska; and the plan combines a summer school and 
• professional institute of the highest class. In this six weeks' 
term credits may be made in the prescribed work of the regular 
courses; and arrangements are also made by which a student 
may, by giving double time to his study in any subject, 
receive credit for a full term's work in that branch. All grades 
made in the summer school are counted toward graduation in </seg>

work of this short term, and experienced teachers find excellent 
opportunities for special study in chosen fields. 

In the first year of the past biennium, on account of the regular 
year being forty weeks long, the summer school was 
changed into a three weeks' " Normal Institute. " While the 
work in this institute was greatly enjoyed by the body of active 
teachers who assembled for it, the plan evidently did not meet 
the requirements in the state. The students consisted almost 
wholly of experienced teachers, and the great bod^of the less 
mature workers throughout the state were not attracted by the 
work offered. When in the second year it was decided to return 
to the plan of the longer summer term, the large increased 
attendance, more than three times as many students as 
in the preceding year demonstrated the wisdom of the decision. 
While adhering to the high standard of professional work of 
the preceding year, many more classes adapted to the needs of 
ambitious young teachers were organized, and the work as a 
whole was better suited to present educational conditions. 

The granting of a fare and-a-third transportation over railroads 
within the state to all students attending the summer 
school has largely increased the influence of the Normal school 
upon the active teaching force of the public schools. 
The summer school has thus become a species of Normal School 
extension. Still further improvements are planned for the coming 
summer; and the faculty are ambitious to offer to Nebraska 
teachers a summer school of the highest class, both for general 
preparation for teaching and for special study in elected fields 
under the guidance of expert teachers. 

The Library of the State Normal school ranks fourth in 
size among the Normal school libraries of America, and 
among the very first in quality. It contains more than 
15000 carefully selected books, representing every field of lit. 
erature of value to Normal school students. All books in this 
collection have been purchased with reference to the specific 
work of the school and to the broad general culture of the well 
equipped teacher. It is especially full in the departments of 
Pedagogy, General and Special Methods and School Administration; 
and it is the aim of the faculty to add to this exceptionally 
valuable collection all current publications in the Eng

lish language dealing with the general problems of education 
and the special work of the Normal school. The periodical 
subscription list numbers more than one hundred general culture 
and technical publications selected with immediate 
reference to the needs of the school. 

The Library fund, derived from Matriculation fees, i9 
ample to provide all the newest and best books in each department 
«very .year. Each teacher selects the most important 
works published in his own field: consequently additions 
are being made constantly to the resources for study in the 
various lines represented in the school. A growing spirit of 
investigation among the more advanced students is thus fostered; 
and the faculty become real leaders of enthusiastic 
searchers after the best in our present civilization. A general 
card catalogue has been made during the past two years 
through the aid of an expert cataloguer ; and it is the purpose 
to print a complete "finding list" in the coming year.

tfht as a modern science with its "observation," "field

work in biology. 

The instruction in the physical and biological sciences is 
among the best offered by the school, but the teachers are 
greatly hindered in their work by the lack of proper classrooms 
and modern equipment With the new buildings which 
the board of education have decided to ask of the coming legislature 
these limitations upon successful work may all be 
removed by a proper remodeling of the south wing of the 
present building. 

Athletics and Physical Culture. 

A new interest in out-door athletics has been awakened in 
the school within the last two years. The new athletic field, 
which when completed will be the finest in the state, has been 
laid out and graded entirely by private subscriptions, without 
the expenditure of one dollar by the state. It is dedicated to 
"clean athletics," properly restricted to such games and exercises 
as can be participated in by successful students without 
interfering with their studies. The basket ball grounds and 
tennis courts have been added to the equipment of the school 
in the biennium and are a great source of pleasure and profit 
to the many students of both sexes participating in the games. 
It is the poPcy of the faculty to encourage all physical exercises 
that will contribute to vigorous manhood and womanhood, 
so directed and supervised as to make it an important part of 
the education which the school gives to the teacher, fitting 
him for a like rational control of the plays and games in his 
own school. 

Ry the decision of the board of education last April the 
:her of Reading and Elocution is now also teacher of Physical 
Culture, devoting her entire time to these subjects. In the 
new curriculum, which went into effect a year ago, provision 
is made for physical culture in every class in the school, and a 
marked improvement is already noticeable among the students.

will ask of the coming legislature, is designed for a spacious </seg>

Forensic Culture and Debating. 

The revised curriculum provides for systematic instruction 
in forensics throughout the junior year. The ready speech 
thus secured among students is adding much vigor to the last 
years &lt; f their work in the school. In the senior year each 
student is required to investigate some educational subject and 
to present the results of his study in free oral delivery before 
the school. No part of the work gives more satisfactory evidence 
of the right of the graduates to rank as professional 
teachers than these "Theses " The themes are assigned early 
in the fall, and are adapted to the individual tastes and interests 
of the students, who are thus enabled to spend five or 
six months in an intensive study of some portion of the education 
*1 field. The public delivery of these Theses mak 
very fitting culmination of the forensic work of the school. 

Two strong debating societies are voluntarily maintained by 
the students: one for the young men, called the Ciceron'sn, 
and one for the young women, called the Athenian. Tue 
vigor and efficiency of the work of these societies is manifested 
in the winning in the last two years of the Inter-State Normal 
school debates with Missouri and Kansas. Both societies were 
represented in the Nebraska teams in these debates; and the 
four consecutive victories encouraged their members and filled 
them with a determination to win again in the coming contests. 
The faculty regard this unprecedented success of the 
school over its worthy rivals as unmistakable evidence of the 
excellence of the instruction in English 

Expenses. 

The average cost of attending the State Normal school for a 
year is about $130. By watchful economy a student may spend 
a year in the school at an outlay much less than this. Board" 
ing, with furnished rooms, costs from $2.50 to $3 per week. 
The cost of books, stationery, laundry and other incidental 
outlays varies with the personal habits of the student, though 
(1 per week is usually considered a very liberal estimate. 
Unfurnished rooms or partly furnished rooms may be rented 
in the town for self boarding at from $4 to $5 per month; and 
students of limited means are able in this way to reduce considerably 
the cost of living. While it is not thought desirable </seg>

for students to board themselves, except in oases where they 
could not otherwise attend school, such persons are aided in 
planning to make their money go as far as possible. Students 
are frequently able to make their expenses while in the school 
by work out of school hours, waiting on tables, caring for 
horses, etc. It is the aim to provide healthful home life for 
students in the State Normal school, with pleasant rooms, 
good food and othe^ necessary comforts and conveniences at a 
moderate cost. 

t fount Vernon Hall is a modern dormitory building, heated 
steam, lighted by electricity, with bath rooms with hot and 
cold water on every floor. This building furnishes a pleasant 
home for ninety young ladies at a charge for room rent of from 
thirty-five to fifty cents per week. Bearding in the dining 
hall is $2.50 per week. At a recent meeting of the board of 
education it was decided to equip a laundry room in the basement, 
where young ladies who wish to do so may care for their 
own personal laundry. 

The Ntrrnml Si-hool Situation in Nebraska. 

That Nebraska is not making adequate provision for the 
training of teachers for her public schools is a fact generally 
recognized, not only by the teachers themselves, but also by 
all thoughtful citizens. While the State Normal school has 
done and is doing good work for the state, it is greatly hindered 
from its full function in the school system by a lack of 
proper equipment and of adequate maintenance. The six per 
cent of the teaching force which it trains annually is 'ess than 
one-third of the number which should be thus fitted for school 
work each year, and which the school could prepare well if it 
were furnished for its must efiBcient service. If Nebraska 
would maintain her present proud position of having the 
smallest percentage of illiterate children and the smallest percentage 
of illiterate voters, she must use every possible means 
of improving her public schools. The schools depend upon 
the intelligence and skill of the teachers employed in them; 
and teachers need practical training for their work. This 
states in a word the whole question. It is hoped that the 
fislature that meets in January will give this important sub! 
the thoughtful consideration which it merits, and tnat 
ir action may result in much good for the state.

NEBRASKA INSTITUTE FOR BLIND, NEBRASKA CITY 

This institution has for its object the mental, moral and 
physical development of the children given into its charge. 
It is a part of the public school system of the state doing for 
the sightless what the common schools do for those possessed 
of the five senses. The prevailing notion that its function is 
charitable, or that it is reformatory or penal in its character 
is radically erroneous. Nor is it in any sense an asylum for 
indigent or helpless blind. Neither is it a hospital for the 
treatment of diseases of the eye. *[t is a school where blind 
boys and girls are taught to read and write ; to add and subtract; 
to do all the work in arithmetic, geography and grammar 
that other boys and girls do, and to do it just as well. 
They also learn algebra and geometry, history, physics and 
chemistry. Besides this those with an "ear" for music learn 
to play the piano and organ, violin, guitar, or horn. 

The school has a good brass band, as well as an orchestra of 
string instruments. The boys learn to tune pianos, make 
brooms and hammocks, and to weave carpets. The girls learn 
to sew, both with needle and machine, to darn, crochet, and 
knit; so that the blind child of a family learns more in his 
school than do his seeing brothers and sisters in theirs. We 
have really three schools in one: common school, music school, 
and industrial. Pupils are found here from all parts of the 
state, the only coat to them being for their clothing and car fare. 

Four teachers give instruction in literary branches, three in 
music, and two in the trades and industries. Of course it costs 
more to carry on a school for blind boys and girls than a 
school for the same number possessed of all their faculties. 
One teacher cannot have many in a class at the same time. 
Think of a teacher trying to start a class of forty to fifty blind 
children in reading. She has to take the child's finger and 
place it upon a letter, telling him what the letter is, and of 
course no other pupil can get any advantage from that instruction. 
Six to twelve pupils are as many as a teacher of the 
blind should have in a class, so that it can readily be seen that 
four teachers for sixty pupils is a very moderate number. In 
music the teacher must work with her pupils in great part individually, 
so that the time of three teachers is fully occupied, </seg>

especially when it is considered that at the present time 40 are 
Sseiving instruction on the piano, 18 in individual voice trainf, 
19 on the violin, 8 on the horn, 12 in band work, and 14 
the orchestra. One industrial teacher instructs 22 boys and 
girls in hammock making, 13 boys in broom-making, 7 in 
carpet weaving, and 4 boys in piano-tuning; while the other 
teacher instructs 15 girls in plain sewing and mending, and 17 
in bead work. 

fne of our young men, who lost his sight three years ago, by 
iding his spare time in making hammocks and fly nets 
horses, and then during the vacation months of summer 
selling his stock of goods among the farmers of his neighborhood, 
makes a good income. During the past summer he sold 
about three hundred dollars worth, and the summer before as 
much or more. 

Manv blind people in the state are self-supporting, and others 
more or less nearly so. 

Several persons who have lost their sight after reaching 
maturity have come to this school for a short term, in order 
§ learn how people deprived of sight do things: to learn how 
io it for themselves. They learn to write the tactile system, 
make hammocks, etc. 

There are several blind children in the state whom we know 
Isuld be here, but through the unwillingness of their parents 
send them away from home, are growing up with little or 
instruction. I have visited two boys in Omaha who should 
in this school, but it has thus far been impossible to prevail 
on their parents to send them. A young man has just come 
whose great regret is that his mother did not send him ten 
years ago. He feels that his time has been largely thrown 
away. A gentleman in Lincoln has expressed regret to me 
Sveral tirres that he did not send his daughter earlier. But 
e whole ground has to be gone over with nearly every case, 
so that from the time a blind child is reported to this school to 
the time that he is sent two or three years have elapsed. 

It is difficult to get the nature of this school before the people 
of the state. I have tried, as have my predecessors, in various 
ways. Last year I tried to prevail upon the executive committee 
of the State Teachers' Association to give us a place on 
the program so that we might bring our work before the </seg>

teachers of tbe state, for it seems to me that if the teachers 
could be interested — and if we could come before them, they 
couldn't help being interested — their influence would be of 
great help in getting the blind children into the school. 

I have written the school superintendents and principals 
asking their aid, and from Plattsmouth and South Omaha 
received replies leading to a knowledge of three blind children, 
two of whom are now in the school.

NEBRASKA SCHOOL FOB THE DEAF,"OMAHA 

Ehe Nebraska School for the Deaf is located at Omaha, and 
junded for the education of such children as by reason of 
of hearing are wholly, or partially, prevented .from reing 
beneficial instruction in the public schools. 

The school has within the past year and a half undergone 
a thorough and complete re-organization. It is now conducted 
under m9thods approved by experienced educators of the deaf. 
The task of leading the child mind from the darkness of 
ignorance to the light of reason through instruction is in the 
hands of trained teachers — trained in the technical means of 
reaching the understanding of the deaf. 

it is a fact that a highly educated and most successful teacher 
the public schools finds himself helpless and 
rthless as a teacher of the deaf. After long experience 
}ng tha deaf, couple! with careful training under the direoa 
of older and more experienced leadership and the use of 
it potent trait of character generally denominated common 
ise, he ra\y beoome capable of understanding the deaf and 
iversing with them intelligently. Then, but not till then, 
tuld one presume to class himself as an educator of the deaf. 

The literary department is carried on unier the "combined 
system." A manual and an oral department are maintained. 
The individual capacity of each child is carefully weighed. 
Tha particular methoi best adapted to one child may ba useless 
for another. All children fitted to receive instruction through 
speech and speech reading are instructed that way. Some are 
taught through the nudiutn of written language and tinger 
spelling or the manual "alphabet. Others who have a trace of 
hearing left are taught, as far as practicable, through the sense </seg>

of hearing. This use of a variety of methods gives rise to the 
appellation, "combined system." 

ta the primary department we have adopted a series of 
,ded lessons known as the "sequence method." This comses' 
over three thousand exercises, both oral and manual, 
I covers the first five or six years of a child's life in school, 
classes are graded according to a standard of advancement, 
I no pupil may pass from one grade to the next higher till 
shall have passed a satisfactory test. 

After graduation from the last or nintn grade, a pupil is 
expected to be able to pass an examination for entrance to Gallaudet 
College, at Washington, D. C, which is the only institution 
in America offering a college education to the deaf. 

The industrial training department has been decidedly improved 
by the addition of tools and equipment never before 
equaled in the history of the institution. Here, pupils are 
taught useful trades and are encouraged to fit themselves 
thereby to earn their own living. 

The domestic department is in a most wholesome and improved 
condition. Cleanliness, neatness and good taste are 
displayed wherever a matron's duties pertain. 

The manners and morals of tne pupils have not been neglected. 
Good behavior, prompt obedience, courtesy and good 
morals are taught and insisted upon from every one connected 
with the institution ; as this, in our opinion, is not only the 
mark of refinement but the fountain of noble character. 

In all our work the aim is to fit these unfortunate children 
to assume the responsibilities of life as other men do, to become 
useful, salf-supparting citizens, and be prepared to worship 
God intelligently and reverently.

It is intended that each child admitted shall receive such degree 
of education as his enfeebled capabilities will permit, the 
training given being on moral, mental, physical and manual 

Where mental deficiency exists, there exists also in most 
cases a deviation, as it were, from the average normal moral 
and physical standards, and much time, patience and perseverance 
must be devoted to the improvement and correction 
of these deviations, and go hand in hand with the training 
and arousing of the mental faculties. 

It i» not expected that any degree of what is known as higher 
education be attained, but any progress, be it ever so little, is 
beneficial and will tend to lessen the burden of care and responsibility 
after the school age is passed, thus making each 
individual not only helpful to himself, but useful to others. 
To reach this object manual training is early introduced into 
the curriculum of all modern progressive institutions for 
feeble-minded children. 

fur method of instruction is based upon a modification of 
kindergarten idea as taught by Proebel. 

Eiur school children are classified much as are other children 
the lower grades of the common schools, with a regular 
gression from the lower to the higher, although much speczed 
effort must be made by the teacher for each individual. 

No pupil is in the school room more than one half of each 
day, the rest of the day being devoted to manual or industrial 
training, physical drill and out of doors recreation, thus securing 
healthy change and variety. 

In deciding upon the school exercises, we bear in mind the 
natural limitations of our pupils. Lessingsays: "Education 
can only develop and form, not create." We do not create a 
faculty but we "draw out" what may not be evident at first, 
but, nevertheless, is there, and it is a question how much devel 
opment is possible in each case. 

ElS a class the feeble-minded have dull perceptions, feeble 
rers of attention, weak will power, uncertain memory and 
ective judgment. 

It is useless to attempt to arouse these dormant faculties by 
forcing upon them the abstract truths of ready-made know- </seg>

ledge. The child must be made to do, to see, to touch, to 
observe, to remember and to think. 

We utilize to the fullest extent the varied and attractive 
occupations and busy work which are so important a Dart of 
the modern graphic methods of instruction for normal children. 

— Object teaching in its broadest sense is a prominent feature 
in our educational scheme. 

In the lower grades 'the pupils are taught form and color by 
ans of sphere, cube and cylinder, sticks, blocks, pictures, 
rers, etc., to cut and paste, to perforate and sew, to form 
akes on slate and blackboard preparatory to writing, to 
tinguish one object from two, to articulate distinctly, to 
iak words, phrases and sentences, to sing simple songs by 
, to form habits of attention and obedience, to obey comads, 
to keep time in marching, to keep step. — In the higher 
ides the pupils are taught to read and write; k&gt; know some- 
Qg of arithmetic, geography, language, history and physiolr; 
the value of money; to tell time; to do free-hand drawing 
I crayon wurk, letter writing and fancy needle work. 

E Nearly all of our pupils receive daily systematic physical 
lining. Mental awakening generally follows as a direct 
suit of increased physical development. The pupil must 
closely attentive, he must quickly hear and understand, be 
ast promptly execute the command. It is a mental as well 
a physical drill. Vocal music is taught in classes and 
orus singing comprises most of the work accomplished in 
is line. Pur band recently organized is doing well. Those 
pable are; taught to read music by note. 

I Certain daily duties are assigned to each boy and girl, and 
ese duties are changed often enough to make each child 
miliar with different kinds of work. 

The boys take great interest in both farm and garden. They 
plow, harrow, and cultivate, weed, hoe and rake. Some assist 
the carpenter and engineer while others do work of various 
kinds in kitchen, laundry and ward. 

The girls do much of the sewing, mending and darning for 
our large household. They are taught to wash dishes, make

titution which relates directly to the mental, moral, religs 
and manual or industrial training of the boys. 

The average number of boys in school during the year is 
one hundred forty. They are divided into four grades, according 
to age and size. There are five grade buildings, but only 
four are in use at this time. Each grade is presided over by a 
family manager or teacher. The wife of the manager is housekeeper 
and matron of the grade. The grade is the "home" of 
the boys. The grade buildings are large, modern brick structures, 
each provided with a large play room, bath rooms, 
school room, family room, guest rooms and boys' dormitory. 
The industrial building contains the shops and trades departments. 
About six hundred acres of land are tended in farming 
and gardening. There being four grades, ; t is so arranged 
that two are in school in the forenoon, while the other two are 
in the shops and in the fields. In the afternoon this order is 
reversed, thereby giving the boys a half day in school and a 
half day in industrial training. This alternation of mental 
and manual labor makes both pleasant and agreeable. All the 
boys are required to attend school. The morning session </seg>

opens at seven-thirty o'clock and continues with only a short 
recess until eleven-thirty. The schoolrooms are about the size 
of our best public school rooms and equipped in about the 
same manner. They are large, light, well ventilated and are 
kept scrupulously clean. The grade manager is an experienced 
instructor and is selected because of his skill and discipline, 
factors of the greatest importance in reform school work. The 
work in the school room differs but little from the work done 
in the public schools. For reasons that are obvious, boys in 
the school are not, as a rule, advanced as far as those in the 
public schools of the state. Special and persistent effort is 
made to drill them thoroughly in writing, spelling and reading. 
This, with arithmetic, geography, history, grammar and 
physiology completes the usual course. The lower grades begin 
school work about the middle of September, the higher 
grades begin a little later on account of farm work. A new system 
of books has been adopted and the old and worn out ones exchanged. 
Consequently, each boy has a set of new books which 
greatly delights him. Report bell rings at eleven-thirty 
o'clock, at which time school closes, shops and trade departments 
close, and the boys come in from the fields and prepare 
for dinner, which is served at twelve o'clock. The boys march 
by companies in regular military order to the dining room. 
Dinner lasts thirty minutes, during which time perfect order 
and quiet prevails. At twelve-thirty the boys march in regular 
order to the play ground, where they remain until one 
o'clock, when two grades repair to the school room and the 
other two line up for detail to the shops and fields. 

I 'he industrial and agricultural training a boy receives here 
among the most potent factors in his improvement and 
armation. A rational system of education includes work 
the hands as well as for the mind. The detail is so classil 
that each boy receives training in the field, in the shops 
I in the school room. Each trade department is conducted 
a competent and skillful instructor. The boys work in the 
ler house, run the engines, heat and light plants, farm, 
¦den, and tend the stock and barn ; laundry the clothes, 
&gt;k, bake, wash dishes, clean house and premises, make and 
&gt;air all clothing, caps, shoes and bedding, repair the builds, 
plaster and paper the rooms, and care for the lawn and </seg>

flowers They conduct a first class printing nstablishmant, do 
all kinds of job work in a workmanlike manner and publish a 
forty-eight page monthly magazine called th9 Courier, which 
is a very interesting and readable paper. In the special trades 
care is taken to select boys adapted to a certain line of work. 
Many skillel engineers, tailors, shoemakers, printers and 
cooks have been paroled from this school. At five-thirty 
o'clock in the afternoon report ball rings and the boys leave 
the school, the shops and the fields and prepare for supper, 
which is held at six o'clock. At six-thirty they go to the play 
grouads or play room in the grade buildings. The play rooms 
are well equipped with papers, books, periodicals and innocent 
gamas. At about seven-thirty the boys go to the school rooms, 
where an hour is spent in study, reading, reciting, writing, 
singing and listening to lectures by the officers in their special 
Iine3 of work, including the elemsntary prin^ipl^s of agriculture, 
horticulture, gardening and stock raising. This hour 
added to the half day session mikes about five hours' school 
work during the dav. At intervals during the winter a numbar 
of boys prepire and deliver talks on subjects with which 
they are familiar. At eight-thirty o'clock the boys retire to 
the dormitory. On Saturday afternoon at three o'clock all 
work is stoppad for the week, and the boys indulge in foot 
ball, base ball and other sports. 

The school has a library of about one thousand volumes selected 
with great care. Books are distributed to the boys 
every Sunday morning. Sunday school is held every Sunday 
morning at ten o'clock, conducted by the officers and 
grade managers, who alternate with each other in this 
work. Many of the teachers are experienced Sunday School 
workers, and with a laudable desire to excel, each makes careful 
preparation, resulting in very thorough work. Every boy 
is required to attend both Sunday School and Chapel. Religious 
services are held regularly every Sunday afternoon at 
three o'clock conducted by the leading ministers of Kearney of 
different denominations, who alternate with each other. This 
plan furnishes the school with the best talent and brings it in 
touch with the religious people of Kearney. After chapel the 
battalion forms on the campus in regular military order, 

where inspection is made by the assistant superintendent. </seg>

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

Clothing, shoes and equipment are examined and a report made 
to the superintendent as to the needs of each boy. The remainder 
of the day is spent in the grades reading, writing 
letters and singing. 

The sanitary condition of the school is always good. Being 
located on a high hill with perfect drainage and sewerage, 
there is little sickness except that incidental to childhood and 
youth. A regular salaried physician from Kearney visits the 
school almost daily and looks after th" health of the boys. 

it will be seen from the above that the boys are always busy, 
ays employed either in school work or in play. There is 
time during the day or night when every boy is not acnt?d 
for. Discipline and constant employment are what 
nts in reform school work. No boy is ungovernable. At 
es some need special restraint and discipline. Their ages 
from ten to twenty years. The scho&lt;| life of a boy will 
rage about two years. Seventy-five per cent of them turn 
to be good citizens. Dr. J. V. Beghtol.

THE GIRLS' INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL, GENEVA 

The object of this school is the teaching of vagrant and delinquent 
girls those things that will best fit them to earn their 
own living in honorable ways. 

Ehe school work consists in having four hours instruction 
1 school day in the common branches of an English 
cation. 

I wing to the motley array that come to us it is hard to mainspecific 
grades, and we are inclined to permit the individpupil 
to advance as rapidly as she desires, realizing that ia 
probability this is all the school work she will ever take, 
fe'ofttimes receive vagrant neglected children at the age of 
Ive or fourteen and even fifteen years that cannot either 
I or write; yet a very few weeks of careful work under our 
ructors and they are making astonishing strides in knowl-3. 
We are much elated over this feature of the work here, 
ing that greater progress has been made in school work 
1 at any similar period in the history'of the school. 

Ee latest text books are used, and the fact that everything 
are doing is strictly up to date proves a great incentive 
rd work on the part of the girls. </seg>

The domestic work of the institution is all done by the girls

ken a three months' course in cooking and dining room work, 
ree months in laundry work, three months in housekeeping and 
ree months in sewing, dressmaking, cutting and fitting. We 
id about eighty per cent of the girls that have passed 
rough this school are making good records. 

I Many of them now have homes of their own and others are 
fely housed in kind households where they are cherished as 
ambers of the family. 

I A serious misapprehension of the aims "and scope of the 
hool has created a strong prejudice against it and its work; 
it time is telling in favor of its work. 

t Scattered over our fair state are scores of homeless or worse 
an homeless girls that need the'care that the state here gives 
e wards entrusted to it : and it is a sad comment on the matter 
enforcement of our laws that so many of these mere children

refullv looked after. 

In summer the hour of rising is half past five o'clock, br 
fast at six, dormitory work and detail work until eight, then 
school work for one family of the school until twelve o'clock,

COTNER UNIVERSITY, BETHANY 

Cotner University is a school of the Church of Christ, and 
is locatad in Bethany, Nebraska, a suburb of Lincoln. It comprises 
three colleges: Liberal Arts, Medical and Dental, the 
last two being affiliated schools known respectively as the 
Lincoln Medical College, and Lincoln Dental College, and 
located in the city of Lincoln, Nebr. 

Property valued at more than '$100,000, free] of incumbrance, 
is held by the board of trustees. The library, consisting 
of about 2,000 bound, and 1,000 unbound volumes, well selected, 
is growing steadily. The scientific apparatus, while 
not expensive and elaborate, is effective. The University 
Dining Club furnishes board at $1.50 per week, in the dormitory, 
where rooms may be rented by ladies only. The entire 
expenses of the year need not exceed $150, and is often made 

Blair College and Trinity Theological Seminary was estab- 
lished to meet the wants of Danish-American youth. A school 
that would teach them the value of the Danish and at the 
same time train them for the duties of American citizens, was 
what the projectors and founders of the college desired. How 
nearly their aim has been realized, the future will tell. There 
are offered thorough commercial, normal, college and theo- 
logical courses of instruction. This year has been added some 
of the branches of domestic science. Besides these there is 
maintained a preparatory department, where the elements of 
learning are taught. Here the immigrant has an opportunity to 
learn the language of his adopted country from those who 
speak his own as well. c ; | • </seg>

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

The endowment, temporary and permanent, is more than 
$20,000, all of which is productive. An agent is in the field 
seeking to advance the interests of the school in every way. 

The College of Liberal Arts situated at Bethany has four 
courses of four years each, leading to the degree of A. B. The 
Preparatory school covers the four years of the public hisrh 
schools from the ninth to the twelfth grade inclusive. 

The Normal school is conducted by a competent faculty, 
thoroughly qualified by training in normal methods and experience, 
to prepare teachers for the public schools. 

A business course is made praccical by actual business 
transactions, carried on in minute detail. A thorough course 
in shorthand and typewriting is maintained. 

The location is all that is desired for health and quietness — 
an ideal place for study, — near enough to the city to enjoy all 
its advantages, yet sufficiently removed to be free from its 
temptations and distractions. W. P. Aylsworth, 

Chancellor. 

THE CREIGHTON UNIVERSITY, OMAHA 

The Creighton University, Omaha, was incorporated in 1879. 
It administers the endowment fund left by Edward Creighton 
for the establishment and support of a classical department or 
school of arts. In this department tuition is entirely free. 
The university has also a medical department, in which a tuition 
fee is charged. The scientific, chemical, physical and 
astronomical departments are excellently equipped for teaching 
and experimental purposes, particularly so since the completion 
of the new buildings at the beginning of the current year. 
The astronomical observatory is provided with all the instruments 
needed for accurate scientific observation. A course of 
seven years leads up to the degree of A. B., four years being 
for the collegiate and three for academic or high school work. 
The average number of graduates receiving the A. B. degree 
has thus far been eight each year, but the increase in the 
number of those who remain for a degree is becoming steadily 
more marked and gratifying, this year promising to reach fifteen. 
The medical department has a four -year course and 
last year's graduating class numbered thirty-seven. Almost 
every year students who have complied with the requirements </seg>

receive the Master's degree. The institution has conferred 
few honorary degrees. The session of the medical department 
lasts eight months ; that of the other department fortytwo 
weeks. The total number of professors is fifty-nine and 
of the students three hundred and eighty. There is no debt of 
any kind. The endowment, which is exclusively for the classical 
department, amounts to about $200,000. The grounds and 
buildings are worth .about $300,000, the scientific apparatus 
about $30,000. The number of volumes in the various libraries 
approximates 13,000, and of pamDhlets 1,200, with a total 
value of $8,000. The Creighton Memorial Hospital, although 
not the property of the Creighton University, nevertheless 
offers to the students of the medical department the exclusive 
use of all its clinical facilities, the best in the city of Omaha. 
This privilege is due to the favorable arrangements made 
by the founder, and to the courtesy of the hospital management. 
The university has no dormitories, the students 
boarding either at home or with private families in the city. 
Board and lodging costs from $160 to $210 for a session of ten 
months. The professors readily give private assistance in 
their studies to those who, on account of a lack of opportunity 
in early life, find themselves older than the average student 
before being able to take up a classical course. Many 
such have come from neighboring states, encouraged by the cordial 
and helpful spirit which they knew awaited them. The running 
expenses of the college proper are reduced to a minimum 
because, as members of a religious order of the Catholic cbuich, 
they give their services without any salary. Students of all 
denominations are received on equal terms. Societies of various 
kinds, literarv, oratorical, dramatic, musical, athletic 
and religious flourish, and whatever helps towards the development 
of a manly, Christian character receives the cordial 
support of the faculty. M. P. Dowling, Chancellor. 

DOANE COLLEGE, CRETE

The institution has had a slow but healthy growth in student 
attendance, in faculty and in facilities for instruction. There 
were fifteen students and one teacher the first year; forty 
students and two teachers the second ; sixty students and three 
teachers the third. At present it has an annual attendance 
of about two hundred students, two thirds of whom pursue 
collegiate courses, and a corps of ten permanent instructors. 
There are four substantial brick buildings; biological, chemical 
and physical laboratories; a library that contains 
volumes and 5275 pamphlets; a well equipped astronomical 
observatory ; time service ; a museum with collections of minerals, 
plants and animals: gymnasiums and an athletic park. 

Iitrong collegiate courses, each covering a perioi of four 
rs, lead to the bachelor's degree. Trustees and faculty 
e from the first insisted upon high standards. The elective 
ciciple has a good place in Junior and Senior years. Labtory 
methods are extensively employed. An academy or 
paratory department has two courses, each of three years,

I he College early came into possession of six hundred acres 
ligh table-land, overlooking the city of Crete and thebeautivalley 
of the Big Blue. The campus of ninety acres rises 
knolls and falls away in slight ravines which contain 
ice springs of water. These ravines have been filled with

dered by shade trees. A more beautiful college site cannot 
ily be found. 

The permanent funds of the college amount to $158,000, 
while other property such as lands, buildings and equipment, 
carry the total assets of the College to nearly $300,000. The 
principal sources of income are gifts, interest on invested 
funds, rent of land, tuition and room rent.

THE LINCOLN ACADEMY, LINCOLN 

This private fitting school for college was founded by C. W. 
Wallace when the University of Nebraska formally dropped its 
preparatory school. Two years ago Mr. Wallace became an 
instructor in this university and sold the school to A. A£. 
Wilson, a professor in the same institution. On August 1, 
1902, the management passed to T. M. Hodgman, the present 
principal and proprietor who for eighteen years has been associate 
professor of mathematics in the University of Nebraska. 

Ehe school has gradually raised its standard of work and 
rged its scope so that in language, science and matheics 
it today prepares for any college in the land. 

Bts aims and activities may be summarized under the follow; 
heads : 

EAccreditment. Its students are accepted without exnation.by 
the State University of Iowa, The University of 
iraska and six other colleges and universities of Nebraska. 

KL Curriculum. The usual college requirements are covered 
Latin, Greek, English, Algebra, Geometry, Physics, Chem•y 
and Botany. 

K Apparatus. Over $1,000 worth of physical, chemical 
botanical apparatus is owned by the Academy. 

4. Teachers. Eleven teachers are employed. With one 
exception all are college graduates, candidates for or already 
holding masters' or doctors' degrees in the subjects taught by 
them. The faculty is eminently a body of specialists. 

5. A Time Saver. Because of the character of its instructors,

ST. TERESA'S HIGH SCHOOL, LINCOLN 

This building was elected in 1889 by the very Rev. Thomas 
Bonacum, first Bishop of Lincoln, at a cost of $35,000, exclusive 
of furniture. This elegant structure, which is Romanesque 
in style and finish, is four stories high and built of 
pressed brick, with old red sand stone trimming. It contain 
large class-rooms together with a spacious auditorium, clubrooms, 
wardrobes and laboratories, etc. 

io the main building was added in 1899 through the untiring 
rts of Rev. J. M. J. Reade, Rector of St. Teresa's Prohedral, 
an additional structure for the residence of the 
«rs of Charity, B. V. M., under whose efficiency the school 
)ys a prominent place among the educational institutions 
he city. 

In 1899 St. Teresa's was accredited to the State University, 
since which time pupils completing the full course are admitted 
to said institution on an equality with the graduates of the 
city high school. 

Besides being modeled after the best plans and all modern 
improvemencs — gas and electric lights, steam heating apparatas, 
etc., — each division is provided every appliance suitable 
for primary, grammar and high school grades. The library 
contains several hundred volumes. The chemical and physical 
departments are furnished with latest and best means for 
experimental purposes together with a large assortment of 
physiological, zoological and botanical charts, studies and 
appliances. 

The yearly enrollment usually reaches about 300 pupils. 
From children whose parents can afford it, a nominal fee is 
required, but those not favored with worldly goods are 
received, on an equality, free of charge. All are, however, 
required to furnish their own text-books, paper and material 
necessary for individual studv. 

Eie object of the school is not merely to keep pace with 
sectarian schools 'in intellectual 'progress, but also to 
ate and develop the spiritual and moral nature of the </seg>

There is also a musical department connected with the school 
in which the full course of music as taught in the more pretentious

UNION 

COLLEGE 

I am pleased to announce that our school has opened up 

favorably for the year 1902-1903. While our school has only 

been running for about six weeks the enrollment is between 

one hundred and twenty-five and one hundred and fifty more 
than what it was the same time last year. We do not have as 
many students who are far advanced in the longer courses of 
study as last year, yet the enrollment for the Normal department 
is much larger. The class of students who have entered 
this department are a very substantial class of young people, 
just such as will be capable of managing public schools. Many 
of these have entered the short Normal course, and after having 
finished it they are planning to spend a year in teaching and 
then return and complete the advance Normal course which 

is three years longer. L. A. Hoopes, President. 

NEBRASKA NORMAL COLLEGE, WAYNE 

The Nebraska Normal College of Wayne was organized in

the following are given each term: For those desiring to 
prepare for any grade of certificates, didactic, literary course 
for teachers, business course for teachers, vocal music course 
for teachers, physical culture course. Each line of work has 
its special department, special teachers and special facilities. 

Ki'he library has increased to 2000 volumes of well selected 
erence books and books for general reading. The Y. W. 
A. and the Y. M. C. A. each has a library of its own for 
i members. 

IPhe Science department is well supplied with apparatus : 
jut £")00 was expended last year in additions and improvents 
in this department. Most of the science work is done 
the laboratory. 

Ewo strong literary societies, weekly debating classes, parlentary 
law classes and lecture courses are maintained 
&gt;ughout the year in order that our students may have every 
antage along these lines. 

A healthier, happier, busier lot of students cannot be found 
than those in this college. These three characteristics — health, 
happiness, work — have been marked features of the N. N. C. 
since its organization 11 years ago. 

Ii'ive buildings are owned by the college whose value is 
imated at $65,000. Plans for another brick building 55 by 
feet have been made and the building will be erected during 
i coming year. The total value of all property is more than 
1,000, all of which is free from indebtedness.

The first class was graduated in 1890. Two years ago there 
was a strenuous effort started to raise 'funds to free the University 
from a heavy indebtedness. We are pleased to report 
that the entire indebtedness of ninety-two thousand dollars

year is twenty per cent greater than last year at the same 

Eie University was never before in so flourishing a conn 
and so well prepared [to do efficient work in the various

At their last annual meeting the trustees increased the 
number of the faculty to meet the growing demands, but their 
anticipations have been more than realized in the large attendance 
and it has been found necessary to increase the faculty 
since the opening of school. 

Ehe institution has fifteen departments, including a Conser&gt;ry 
of Music, a School of Expression, and a School of 
lmerce. 

All students who have passed successfully the eighth grade

Academy or Preparatory School. 

The Department of Education is in full accord with the 
requirements of the State Department. This department 
includes the Normal which is designed to furnish to all those

ARGUMENTATIVE 

t support of these measures I offer the following arguts: 


II) I believe that every person should attain to the full age 
eighteen years before assuming the responsible position of 
&gt;ublic school teacher, and there are many who believe that 
roung man should be at least twenty years of age before beming 
to teach. During the present calendar year several 
our county superintendents have licensed persons as young 
sixteen years on account of the scarcity of teachers. They </seg>

            <seg id="p421">
996 

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

claim that some persons are as competent to teach at sixteen 
as others are at twenty. I will admit that, but I claim also 
that many others are never competent to teach. However, 
very few people possess the necessary tact and good judgment 
to conduct a good school at the tender and immature age of 
sixteen years. It is perhaps inadvisable to enact a measure 
establishing eighteen years as the minimum age at the present 
time, but seventeen years may be established with safety in the 
hope that it may be increased to eighteen years two or four 
years hence. This will insure a better preparation in general 
by those who contemplate teaching. It will assist in placing 
the schools in charge of men and women, or those who are 
more nearly men and women, for it is true that in many 
counties of the state boys and girls are licensed to teach. 
Maturity of thought and judgment are necessary qualifications 
of a successful teacher. Then, too, for physical reasons young 
girls should not be allowed to take up the strenuous life of 
school teaching. 

I!) Bookkeeping has no place in the course of study for the 
rage country schools, that is, as a separate subject. The 
ping of accounts in a neat, careful, systematic manner 
aid be taught in connection with arithmetic. A large maty 
of the teachers in the rural schools hold second and 
d grade certificates. The omission of this subject from 
second grade certificate requirements would permit 
shers to make a more thorough preparation in the f undaital 
branches that they must teach. 

(3) Every school room is made brighter and pleasanter 
when music is added to the daily program. This does not require 
teachers to be able to sing but simply to have such a 
knowledge of the rudiments of music as will enable them to 
conduct successfully the music in their schools or to see that 
some other teacher or one or more of their pupils do so. Two 
years or more are given to prepare for the examination in 

(4) The plan of establishing a board of examiners in the 
state department for the examination and grading of all 
teachers' manuscript would relieve the county superintendents 
of their most onerous task, do away with the cry of favoritism 
so often made against them, raise the scholarship of teachers </seg>

NEEDED SCHOOL LEGISLATION. 

Pthem absolutely on their merits, as all examinations 
conducted strictly on civil service rules. It is true 
ides do not make teachers, ' ' but all teachers should 
;o make grades. For a further discussion of this 
Be "The Examination" and "Trained Examiners," 
-191 of this report. 

15) This is a matter of reciprocity. Persons holding state 
professional life certificates in Nebraska are qualified to 
,ch in any state in the Union, but the superintendents of 
ler states will not endorse Nebraska state certificates uns 
the state superintendent of Nebraska is permitted to enrse 
or approve these certificates from other states. 

(6) This will expedite the work of the county superintendent 
and will also enable the state superintendent to make his 
report to the Governor at the opening of the legislature. This 
department has been compelled to send out to some superintendents 
and principals four or five calls for their reports. It 
simply applies business principles to the making of final or 

I") Boards of education of schools in cities now have aurity 
to elect their superintendents for a term not in excess of 
Be years. There is no valid reason why such power should 
be given to boards of education in high school districts as 
1. It will establish a longer tenure of office for earnest, 
gressive superintendents and principals. Many good 
ool men and women are lost to the high schools of Nebraska 
ry year because high school boards of education do not 
e authority to contract with them for a longer term than 

18) A longer term for every county officer would be for the 
aeral welfare of the people, but no county official has a 
onger claim to an increased term of service than the'county 
serin tendent. This office should be taken out of politics 
far as possible. It takes the superintendent nearly one-half 
i first term as at present constituted to learn the schools of 
i county thoroughly. A longer term would enable him to 
.ugurate policies and to carry them out without the necessity 
"stepping sideways" fora few months every other fall, 
xt to the teacher the life of the rural school is the county 
jerintendent. The people can ill afford to engage the ser- </seg>

tis of any but the best that may be secured for the intellit 
supervision of their schools, and better ones can be seid 
only by means of higher salaries. It is economy as well 
ustice and wisdom to pay county superintendents salaries 
¦e in accord with what may be earned in other lines of work. 

(9) The demand for such qualifications is so self-evident 
that argument should be unnecessary. At present it is not 
only possible but it is true that superintendents are elected 
who are not qualified to pass upon the manuscript of the 
teachers they examine. 

110) The county superintendent is or should be a traveling 
q. He should be perfectly familiar with every village and 
intry school in his county. He should know his teachers 
I the people. His field work is more important than his 
ce work but the latter should not be neglected, and yet 
ectors and patrons of the schools constantly grumble when 
y make a long trip to the county seat and find the county 
?erintendent's office door locked.* In counties large terriially 
or in school census close supervision is impossible 
ler the superintendency of one person. It is as necessary 
t the county superintendent have a deputy as for the county 
rk, the treasurer and the sheriff to be so provided. 

Ill) Under the existing statute the law contemplates a 
ant officer for each district, and when the district board 
Is to appoint a truant officer it is the duty of the director to 
as such. First, as a matter of economy there should be a 
ant officer for the whole county; and, second, the director 
nine cases in ten will neglect his duty to enforce the law 
ough fear of gaining the ill will of his neighbors. It has 
in suggested that the sheriff is the proper truant officer, 
t it seems more in keeping with school work to place this 
ty upon the county superintendent or his deputy. 

tl2) This would do away with the possible "deadlocks" in 
election of teachers and other business that requires a 
jority vote. It would insure greater care on the part of the 
&gt;ple in the selection of reputable citizens for membership 
)n the school board, and it is in line with the prevailing 
itiment in favor of a longer tenure of office in school manjment 
and control. </seg>

NEEDED SCHOOL LEGISLATION. 

(13) It often happens that there are those elected as members 
of school boards whose greatest ambition is to secure a 
place for a daughter or a son, a sister-in-law or a brother-inlaw, 
or a cousin, regardless of fitness. The temptation for ' 'a 
trade" is too great to be resisted. "To the victor belongs the 
spoils" becomes the individual motto and practice of too many 
school board members. "A community of interests" is established 
at the expense of the schools. To protect the people 
against the evils of nepotism I urge upon the legislature the 
importance of enacting a law which will make it illegal for a 
school board member to vote for a blood or marital relation to 
teach in the public schools. This law should apply to every 
school district in the state. 

(14) Such a law would be a death blow to the chart sharks 
that go about the country seeking whom they may devour and 
devouring all they find. Business interests demand that the 
school fuuds be appropriated for the general welfare. Such a 
law would do away with the expenditure of money without due 
consideration and would inaugurate system into rural school 
matters that obtains in very few places. 

(15) Such a meeting would create an interest in school 
matters generally and would make it possible to close up the 
annual school business between school officers and county superintendents 
in time to save many districts the loss of the state 
apportionment of school money which now results from neglect 
on the part of school officers to make a proper report. 
Directors should be paid from the general fund of the county 
for the one or two days spent in this meeting as assessors are 
paid. No other business comes near so many of our people as 
that of our public schools. These meetings would give the 
school officers an opportunity to confer with the county superintendents 
relative to teachers, textbooks and every matter of 
interest relating to the success of the school work in their 
respective districts. 

(16) This is merely a curative act. 

E17) In districts where the school census falls below one 
ldred (100) it is often difficult to find six persons who are 
e and willing to serve on the board, and where it is manory 
to maintain a board of six members it is sometimes 
icult to secure a quorum. It would expedite matters in </seg>

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

many ways to give this class of districts authority to return to 
the organization with a board of three members. 

K8) This would lengthen the term of school in hundreds of 
ricts in the state, which means increased opportunities for 
isands of school children. 

K9) This proposed amendment clears the law from ambiies 
and places the time a child is required to attend school 
)nd dispute. 

I)) The law in this section is silent as to whether a majorr 
plurality vote is required to elect. While a plurality 
elects in city districts I believe it would be for the general 
are of the rural districts to require a majority vote of 
a present and voting to elect officers. Otherwise, two or 
3 votes would often eiect school officers, and even with a 
»rity vote required to elect there will still be cases where 
or three votes will be sufficient to elect. It may be of in 
it to know that in many districts only the three school 
jrs and perhaps one or two others attend the annual meeting. 

(21) The first condition of a good school is a sufficiency of 
funds to maintain it. Under our existing revenue laws twentyfive 
(25) mills, the present limit, is entirely inadequate for the 
needs of hundreds of districts in Nebraska that are voting this 
limit, and maintaining from three to six months of school and 
paying their teachers from twenty to thirty dollars a month. 
I, therefore, urge upon the legislature to provide relief by 
making thirty (30) mills, exclusive of bonded indebtedness, 
the limit of taxation for all school districts in the state except 
those organized under Subdivision XVII, Schools in Metropolitan 
Cities. This amendment need not affect the thousands of 
districts that are voting below the twenty-five (25) mill limit. 

(22) Hundreds of districts in this state, limited as they now 
are in the amount of bonded indebtedness they may incur, cannot 
vote a sufficient amount to erect a good, substantial school 
building. It would be economy as well as wisdom to permit 
them to build better schoolhouses. 

(23) This recommendation simply relieves our statutes of 
a cumbersome obstacle for whose existence there can no longer 
be given any good reason. 

E24) Such a law would make it possible for county superintenxts, 
school board officers and teachers in rural districts to get </seg>

rid of ancient text books and substitute in their stead modern,upto-date 
ones. The teachers and pupils need these new books as 
much as the farmer needs modern farming implements. As it 
is now, the text books used in the cities of Nebraska are far 
superior to those used in the rural schools. 

(25) Many county boards will not go above the minimum 
sum in their appropriation for the county institute. This is 
false economy. This minimum amount was made when the 
state was young and many counties were unable to go above 
it, but now every interest of the general public demands a more 
tal appropriation for the county institute and in many 
ties the maximum can and should reach $150. 

(26) (27) (28) Argued under the head of the Normal School 
Question, pages 172-184 of this report. 

(29) I feel that the state can well afford to make a strenuous 
effort to place within the reach of its teachers opportunities for 
a better preparation for their signal calling. This plan would 
afford the teachers outside the county where such summer 
school or junior normal is held the same opportunities as the 
teachers in such county. In other words, it is practicing as 
well as preaching the grand motto of our state, "Equality 
Before the Law." 

(30) Surely the state that stands at the head of the list 
with the smallest percentage of illiteracy will not fail to make 
a liberal appropriation for an educational exhibit at the World's 
Fair, St. Louis, in 1904. No exhibit that can be made will 
reflect greater credit upon this grand commonwealth of ours 
than a magnificent exhibit of our educational interests. 

(31) The law referred to is a dead letter. I doubt if any 
county in the state will desire to organize a rural high school 
under these sections. The proper method to get a rural high 
school is by the consolidation of four or five districts and the 
transportation of pupils to a central school. The Rural High 
School Law as it now exists has served only to becloud the 
public mind on other matters of greater importance. 

(32) This law has proven impracticable and its authors as 
well as those who have tried to carry it into effect are unanimous 
in their request for its repeal. </seg>
