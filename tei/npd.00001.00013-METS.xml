REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. 

Attorney Generals Office, 

i.n. Nov. 30th, 1882. 

fb His Excellency, Albinus Nuance, Governor of the. State ot 

Nebraska 

Sir: I herewith submit the 
transactions of this office for the 

following report of the business 
1881 and 1882: 

Schedule "A," hereto annexe 

1, contains a list of cases in which 

the State was interested and whiefr 

h have been Qigaed and disposed 

of by the Supreme Court. 
Schedule "B" contains a list 

of cases now pending in th&lt; 

preme Court for hearing. 
Schedule " C " contains a list 

of cases in the Circuit Court ot 

the United Stat 

Schedule "D" contains a list 
the State of Nebraska in which 

of cases in the District Courts ot 
the State is interested. 

There is one case to which I desire to call your attention, and 
which will require further action on the part of the Legislature. 

That is the claim of Hon. Thomas P. Kennard for the prosecution 
and collection of claims of the State of Nebraska igauMl the 
United States. 

In the year 1873 the Legislature passed a law authorizing th»' 

Governor to appoint an agent on behalf of the State to prosecute 

to final decision, the claim of the State due from the United 

States for five per cent, and upon the lands of this State dispose*! 

of by Indian Reservation, and by the location of Military 
Land Warrants and Land Scrip issued for Military Services iu 
the war of the United StatM, ami for Agricultural Colic 

,i nd Rail Road lands.

[nder this law, on the 15th day of October, 1874, Gov. Rober 
Furna8 entered into a contract with said Kennard, in whicl 
said K&lt; -nnard was to prosecute said claims, and for which he 
said Kennard. WM to retain one half of the amount collectei 
pay the other hah' to the Governor of the State, or his me 
or in office, for the use and benefit of the State of Nebraska. 

K urine the month of September the Hon. Treasurer of thi 
ted States transmitted to your Excellency, in two drafts, th&gt; 

sum of six thousand two hundred and seventy-five dollars and 
forty teTOB eents, and said letters of transmittal stated it to be the 
amount found due to the State from the United States on Indian 
Reservation. 

frhen the above drafts were so received, the said Kennard 
la application to your Excellency for one half these sai&lt;l

' 

Et the time of the levy of these taxes and their payment 1 
plaintiff, the legal title of the property was in John Qillesp 
taxable m against him. 

A- : • sale ami the payment of the taxes as above stated, at 
action was brought for the purpose of foreclosing a mortgage 
on the promises, giveo by John Gil'.espie in 1867 to the Statr 
care ¦ bond for the payment of moneyi borrowed from th*. 
School Fund. A decree of foreclosure was attained 
property offered for sale and bid in by the State, and sale 
firmed. 

ILfterward the present action was commenced in the Circuit 
irt of the United States against GKUespie, while he was in 
'ii of the property, and the State was subsequently made 
lefendant by order of the Court. The trial of the case disced 
certain defects in the tax proceedings, which were, in the 
nion of the Court, sufficient to defeat the plaintiff*! title under 
tax deed, and a judgment' was rendered in favor of the State 
in which an appeal has been prosecuted to the Supreme Court 
ili. United States, where it is now pending. What the result 
[h&lt; appeal may be there is, of course, no means of knowing. 

That the plaintiff purchased the tax titles in good faith, and 
upon the strength of statutes expressly trained for that purpose, 

and that the money has been a&lt; 
1 1 r v and used for public porpot 
of doing justice to all of the c 
cloud from the title of the land 
iature should take some action 
: the property and at tin

tizens of thi and raising a

that may be proper, so as not tt
