            <seg id="p011">XKBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 11 The public has contributed handsomely to the railroads in the irs in Um way of increased traffic, without propor - tionate ir ii expenses. The abrogation of the free pass evil has proven a great boon to the railroads and has helped i\ to make up the difference in the former rates and those now paid by revenue p-issengcrs. The ultimate result, indicated by an analysis of the reports rendered to the Commission, seems lo be that the railroads in Nebraska are prosperous and are earning at least reasonable returns ui&gt;on their investments. This immense saving to the people of Nebraska has been accomplished with only a slight increase in post over the ordinary expenses of the two departments charged with the duty of upholding these laws, and his been incidental to the many other duties imposed upon them. Since the enactment of these laws and during the period of their enforcement, the judges of the federal courts have rendered decisions in favor of the railroads and adverse to the never*] states in litigation of similar character in Arkansas. Oklahoma. Missouri and Minnesota, and such cases are either in. or on their way to. the Supreme Court of the Fnited States for final adjudication, the ultimate result being at this time some - what problematical. The Commission and the Attorney General are. nevertheless, not discouraged by the outcome of the litiga - tion in neighboring states, believing that the statistics compiled under their direction give them absolute command of facts heretofore not fully developed in other eases, which facts will lie of inestimable value to the courts in reaching just and ac - curate conclusions. It is confidently believed that the showing made will prove that the prescribed rates are not confiscatory, but that they are reasonable, and enable the railroads to earn ample returns. Anticipating success in this litigation, it is hoped to perpetu - ate, and from time to time enhance, the saving to the people t Nebraska in transportation charges, and also to settle the (|iiestion of the power of the state to regulate common carriers to the extent of obtaining for the public reasonable and just rates. </seg>

NEW LEGISLATION Generally ■peaking, there is no imjierative demand for new railroad legislation ;it the present time. Tile laws passed liy the last two legislatures have fairly sitisfied public requirement* along these lilies, and means for their continued enforcement are needed now mure than additional restrictions. The ( 'oiiimission in its First Annual Report (page* 22-27;. .1 n&lt; I in its Second Annual Report (pagm 8-15), however, called Attention to certain defects in the Railway Commission act and other statutes affecting common carriers, and advised their cor - rection, besides raggvatmg ■ few new laws of secondary im - portance which experience had eoaviaeed it should he enacted. We renew these reeoiiiiiieiida t ions at this time, and particularly urge the following: 1. Amendment of provinionn of the ( 'onunisnion aci relating to appellate procedure, so as to require appeals from orders of the Commission to be taken within a reasonable time; also to prevent the introduction of new evidence upon such appeals. The justice of this proposition should be apparent to all. As the law now stands, no time limit is fixed within which appeal proceeding* must be tiled, and no limitations are imposed upon the ■bowing which either party may make upon such appeal. This is not only unfair to the Commission, but is likely to prove burdensome and discouraging to citizens bringing just grievances </seg>

Amendment of subdivision g. section 14 of the Commis - sion act. to provide that certain exceptions may be made under the anti-discrimination statute in favor of other classes of traffic than freight. If the handling of frcigl r r the state, cities, counties, towns. in the I' public policy, it appears that there can be no good reason for denying telephone companies and kindred carriers the MM privib _ serving the public without money and without price. Similarly, provision should be made for transporting free the lions' effects of railroad employes, who are frequently transferred from one point to another, and whose right to exemption from the prohibitions of the Anti-Pass act has never been questioned. The clause referred to should either be made consistent by amendment or repealed. 4. Creation of the office of public weighmasler. or giving the Commission added authority along that line. I'ndoubtedly a large proportion of the present dissatisfaction with railrpad service grows out of the existing methods for ob - taining weights on both carload and less carload shipments Practically all of this business in Nebraska is handled by the Western Weighing Association, which is but indirectly under the jurisdiction of the Commission, if at all. It would seem that new </seg>

As a matter of fact, the general expenses of the Commission for the yen- covered by this report should be credited with $992.50, that amount having bcea carried liy the and turned hack into the state treasury.

            <seg id="p017">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 17 under a tentative order issued .July »i. 1!M)!&gt; (general order No. 1!». pages M6-H3, Second Annual Report . This investiga - tion covered an exaiuiiiHtion of every intrastate waybill issued by the Rock Island. Burlington an&lt;l I'riion 1'aeitie railroads dur - ing .July and October, IMS, and January and April. 1JHW. The principal facts shown by these waybills were compiled in con - venient form and transferred to the permanent records of the ( 'onitnissioii. As a result of this work the ( 'ommission now has available for immediate reference data showing the character of all intrastate shipments moving over these three roads during the four representative months named, together with the rates charged and the revenue derived therefrom. From these figures it is |M)ssible to estimate evry closely the effects of the 1") per cent, reduction in freight rates under the Aldrieh bill of 1!M17. II as the probable effects of any further reductions which the ComniiHHion may have under contemplation. The original purpose of this investigation was, as stated above, to assist the Commission in reaching a correct decision with reference to re - ducing class or merchandise rates, but the facts developed by it have proven of gVMrf assistance to the state in the defen - the rate laws now pending in tile federal court. It is. at the ■it time, doubtful whether any further steps toward a gen - eral reduction of freight rates will be taken until after this litigation has been concluded, as it is feared that such action may have the effect of weakening the state's ease. The facts developed by the investigation, however, together with a system ..f monthly station reports and the annual reports tiled by each of the railroads, give the Commission a fund of information avail - able for use at any time, which it is confidently believed will enable it to justify any conclusions with reference to rates ami revenues that may be reached in the performance of its duties.

Other states are gradually tak - ing up the idea, and the Interstate Commerce Commission's powers in that respect have recently been greatly strengthened by an amendment which gives it power- to suspend any proposed advance of rates, either upon complaint or upon its own initiative During the fMi eadiaf N&lt;&gt;\ -ember :io. 1910. thirty-four </seg>

            <seg id="p099">NBBK \TK RAILWAY COMMISSION 99 I h a view to ascertaining, from the books and such oti nation as could be obtained from its officials and employes, ami without making or attempting to make an valuation of the property, tbe present condition as to its aas«ta and liabilities and the earning capacity, as well as setting forth, as shown by the books, the re\ ■ a, expenses and net incomes, for the past twelve moir KOur investigation has covered only the period from the consolidation the Lincoln Traction Company and the Citizens Railway Company, . 1909. LOn the date last named, the combined assets of the two compan: wn by the books of the Lincoln Traction Company and the reports nr honorable body as of Januar.. would indicate a value of $2,50 which, by the journal entries made for opening the new books of the consolidated company immediately on the next morning, i. e.: February I, 1!H&gt;». became $3,877.6:56.06. In order that the Commission may be advised as to the manner in ange was made am the books of The Lincoln Traction we have prepared an exhibit of the assets and liabilities as shown from the annual reports of the two companies on January 31, 1M9, as shown by the books of the consolidated company February 1, 1*09, June • and February ■, 1910, which sets forth the book - as are there shown, and from which may be determined the manner in which the raise in book value was brought about. The general railway plant, in the consolidated books opened on Feb - ruary l. 1909, is shown at a valuation of $24,000.00 per mile for track and •erhead equipment in paved streets, and at $18,000.00 per mile for track and equipment in streets not paved, covering all of the track and over - ead equipment of the combined companies, and including the "Lincoln oa Company Kxtension." so called on the books, and being the tension to Havelock. and also the College View part of the Citizens nterurban. which had been carried on the Citizens' books as a separate ration. There was arbitrarily added to the value of the lighting ant, as shown on the books, some $65,000.00 and to the power plant bout $34,000.00 above the value shown on the books on the preceding •ening. There was also added to the book value of the heating plant I in like manner. Between the night of January 31, 1909, and the morning of February 1. MH, in like manner the value of the office building increased frcm $8,100.00 to $1 Outside investments of real estate, which on January 31st were shown on the books as of a value of $8,900.00, became worth $20,150.00 on February 1, 1909. Tools, which had a value of $2, - 784.00 on January :51st. appear to be worth $14,000.00 on the morning of February 1. 1909. The stock held in the Citizens Railway Company, valued on the books at $1,016.00 January 31st, was entered as of a value of $2,250.00 on the morning of February 1, f909.

The balance sheet as of this date shows a deficit, or as might be interpreted, an over- capitalization of $1,711,639.23. Your attention is called to the fact that the current liabilities on the date last referred to amount to $256,000.00, as against $97,000.00 on January 31, 1909. An examination of the books discloses the fact that two sets of books are kept for the disclosure of the revenues and operating expenses of The Lincoln Traction Company and its auxiliary plants, the principal set of books covering the account of the railway plant, the commercial lighting plant and the commercial power plant, and the transactions of the heating plant being kept in a separate set of books. Without checking the matter in minute detail, it appears that the revenues for the various de- partments are kept well segregated and set out in their proper form. The main operating expenditures, however, are of course made indis- criminately for all departments, and paid out of one general fund, and it becomes necessary then, and at the end of each month the Traction com- pany does make an apportionment of the greater part of these expenses </seg>
            <seg id="p104">104 THIRD ANNUAL REPORT referred to as between the railway, commercial light and MSUM power departments. There is also a small part of the expense appor - tioned to the heating department. The books purport to show that the coll properly chargeable to the light, and which of themselves indicate that they are expenditures for that department, and likewise for the power department, are charged di to these departments. The proportion* chargeable to the roiim. light and commercial power departments, however, for current furnished. ! ing the operation of the power plant, maintenance of the power plant building and equipment, fuel, water, lubiication and some miscellaneous expenses are apportionments and are apportioned between eonim light, commercial power and railway departments on the basis of the kilowatt hour output at the power house. In this connection we are told by the officials of the company that the instruments used for measuring the current in part do not i • . full current passing through them at the time of the peak loait. and the apportionment on the kilowatt hour basis, then, with this api&gt;.&lt; crepancy. becomes a mere arbitrary estimate, but it is impossible i tain or use anything more satisfactory. \V&gt; are also told th:r present contemplated installation of new instruments will correct this so that the measurements will be more accurate in the futu No part of the expense for power plant operation, maintenance or fuel is charged on the books of the company or ap|&gt;ortioned to the heating plant, but the expenditure for these items as shown by the books, and the wide variation in the amounts as between summer and winter coats would indicate that a considerable proportion should be apportioned to the beating plant for energy or steam furnished to it In the matter of general expenses covering salaries and expenses of general and executive officers, general office clerks and expenses, law expenses, and other items, we find that the apportionment has been mad* between the three departments, excluding the heating department, on the basts of the revenue The expenditures for railway, light and power operations by items and by months, from Feburary 1. 1JM&gt;9, to February 2&amp;. 1910. are set forth in two sheets marked "exhibit E-l and 2." The details of the items of cost for current and miscellaneous or general expenses for both the com - mercial light and the commercial power departments, are set forth in sheet marked "exhibit E-3." These fljrures shown on exhibit E represent the figures as shown by the books of the company in the details as mentioned, but are not by us verified to the extent of having checked the vouchers or operating sheets, we having assumed, as seemed apparent on its face, that the books with regard to these particular items were correctly kept. In order that a fattr apportionment of expenses might be made be - tween the four departments of the company, and in order that the heating plant should be charged with its proper proportion, as nearly as might be ascertained, of the cost of operation, we have reapportioned the cost </seg>

We find that for the months of May to September, inclusive, during ■ im • r -•■ems to have been furnished, the average cost of induction of the current was U$ cents, and calculating from that, making due allowance for purported extraordinary conditions and 'lam of the winter months, as claimed by the officials of ■iinpaiiy. we find the apportionment of these expenses to be $17, M heating plant and $102,18;i.lo for the railway, light and power, turn apiiortioned between those three departments on the asis of the kilowatt hours furnished, as reported by the company itself. In making calculations for the charge of energy to the heating plant, allowance is made, as heretofore stated, for extraordinary winter con - ■ 1 other troubles to which the officials of the road called our • ion. without, however, being able to definitely state how far such extraordinary costs and troubles run. There was taken into consideration what was claimed by them to be ■ .il, the fact that the railway company required a g reason of the heating of the cars, and that Ml used during certain months of the winter time was of an inferior ualr part of these claims, of course, the heating plant should table with its full share of the extraordinary costs or in- Bctonclea Neveri assume that for the months of December, anuary and February, which showed costs much in excess of the usual • nt should be first allowed as excess cost over summer costs. Before apportionment was made to the heating plant of the ex - ess fuel and cost of operation to produce steam for its use, it will be that the amounts set out as being chargeable to the heating plant uctuated disproportionately with the revenues, and the method adopted tea not produce results which would seem to be entirely satisfactory us, but we can find no other method on which to base this charge ■at would prove more satisfactory to all concerned for the operations the past, during which no account has been kept with regard to this cm.

            <seg id="p138">134 any action on its part would affect the lighting and power departments and the heating company. It developed during this bearing that the article* of incorporation of the Traction company do not give it authority to produce light and power for commercial purposes, but it was claimed by the Traction company's attorney tbat such authority had been granted to a company to whose rights it succeeds as the purchaser of property, and he also cited an ordinance of the City of Lincoln by which it had been granted the use of the streets and alleys for such purposes, the City of Lincoln reserving the right to fix maximum charges for services Neither the constitutional amendment creating the Commission nor chapter 90. Session Laws of 1907. defining its powers and duties, has con - ferred any authority on this board to regulate or control any public serr - ice corporations other than those designated as common carriers, which are defined as follows: "The term common carrier' a* used herein shall include railway lines operated either by steam, electricity or any other motive power, any express company, car company, sleeping car company, freight and freight line company, telegraph sad telephone companies and any other carrier engaged in the transmission of passengers or freight for hire." The Commission screes with the contention of the city attorney that there should be a fixed and compensatory charge made by The Lincoln Traction Company for all services rendered to any other or subsidiary company (or services, and all such amounts so earned must be made a part of its income account. The service rendered the lighting plant, power plant, steam heating plant, Morris Transportation Company and the Omaha. Lincoln * Railway Company is. and shoui accounted for on tl. side of its books of account It is just as practical to measure the kilowatt hours furnished to these subsidiary companies for power and light as it is for them to measure the kilowatt hours to their patrons. A meter at the pumping station will indicate the gallons of water pumped into the mains, and other meteri m the homes of consumers would indicate the amount consumed so with electricity, and when this electric current passes tl meter at the power station, the Traction company shoul.. ■ fair return for the service performed. It becomes then a product for distri - bution over which this Commission is given no control, either as to cost or service; but another body, the city council, can fix rates and regulate the service. It seems to the Commission to be equity that every public utility or common carrier should be compelled to charge reasonable rates for any service it performs for the public, and with equal j the public should pay a reasonable amount for such sen It Is the contention of the city attorney that the earning- of the lighting plant are now 22 per cent., the power plant 60 per cent., and the finding of Messrs. Wettling and Powell in their report to the Commission is that when the earnings of all the plants (street railway, lighting and power) are combined, they are approximately 6.3 per cent., and if the </seg>

The Commission is, and should always be, loath to assume powers of regulation which are not given to it expressly, or by necessary impli - cation, by the constitution or by the laws which create and define its powers. The Commission cannot undertake to regulate industries other than common carriers, as defined by statute, but where such common carriers, as is the case with The Lincoln Traction Company, are devoting part of their energies to subsidiary, auxiliary plants or other industries, it will, in justice to the public being served by that portion of the cor- poration over which it has control, see to it that no expense is incurred in behalf of the others and charged to the main or parent plant without adequate return to the parent plant therefor. In so doing the Commis - sion feels that it goes as far as its powers permit, in requiring that no wr remotely connected with the carrier which may hap - pen to be under consideration, and over which it has no jurisdiction or s of regulation, shall make large or excessive profits at the expense of such carrier. If we understand the contention of the city attorney, it is that the Commission should not segregate the different classes of business in which The Lincoln Traction Company is engaged, but should take them as a whole and ascertain whether or not the net profits arising from all would justify it in sustaining existing transportation rates or in making further reduction thereof. Under the facts developed in this case, it is the opinion of the Commission that this position is not tenable, for the reasons hereinafter stated. A situation is presented in this matter with reference to rates and basiaess over which the Commission has control, and rates and business over which it has no control, in close analogy to that presented in the case of Smyth 169 I". S. 466, where one of the questions in - i was whether or net earnings of the railroad company from both state and interstate business, should be taken into consideration in ascer - taining the reasonableness or unreasonableness of domestic rates. In that case the State Board of Transportation had jurisdiction only over intrastate rate* and business, and the Interstate Commerce Commission or Congress had authority only over interstate rates and business. The Court held "The reasonableness or unreasonableness of rates prescribed by a state for the transportation of persons and property wholly within its limits must be determined without reference to the interstate business done by the carrier, or to the profits derived from that business. The not justify unreasonably low rates for domestic transportation, considered alone, upon the ground that the carrier is earning large - on its interstate business, over which, so far as rates are con - £1. the state has no control: nor can the carrier justify unreasonably igh rates on domestic business upon the ground that it will be able nly in that way to meet losses on its interstate business." As above suggested, in the case under consideration, the Railway </seg>
            <seg id="p140">136 THIRD ANNUAL REPORT Commission has express jurisdiction alone over that part of the busi ness of the street railway company which it is performing as a common carrier, and has no express jurisdiction or authority over the rates an business that the company is performing as a heating, lighting or powe company. In our judgment, the Commission would have no authority t consider the earnings of the company for the classes of business it i transacting outside and independent of its business as a common carrier unless such subsidiary or auxiliary business is so inseparably connecte&lt; with the business conducted by the company as a common carrier that the Commission cannot intelligently segregate the one business, its properties, revenues and expenses, from the other.

Again, in the decision of Smyth r. .lines, l«t l T . S. 466 States Supreme Court said: "When a sta; Ues to prescribe maximum rates on local business done by an interstate carrier, it must do so with ref. exclusively to what is just and reasonable between the carrier and the public in respect to domestic business alone, and interstat- </seg>
            <seg id="p141">\ STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 137 cannot be made to bear losses resulting from the rates prescribed for local business." Applying the principles of the above established by the Court to the case at hand, only to the extent that they appear directly applicable, the i ominission is of the opinion that it is unauthorized to consider the net ties of the company arising from its combined business as a basis for raising or lowering transportation rates, even though the net profits £ from the business of the company, other than transportation, seem to be unreasonably large. If the profits arising from the business of the company, other than that of transportation, are unreasonably large, it is fair to presume that they result from excessive charges being made for the service rendered to those who enjoy the service of these *-s. or that their costs for energies furnished by the Traction company are unreasonably low. Such users have a right to demand that only a reasonable charge be exacted. The city that has the exclusive jurisdiction over such charges becomes the proper party of whom relief may be demanded by the public using such service. This relief may be given by ordinance reducing the charges for heat, light or power. It is much more reasonable and logical that those receiving the services of these subsidiary corporations in the form of heat, light or power, should apply to and receive, from the body directly authorized to grant same, from any unjust burdens placed upon them for these services, than that the Railway Commission should make an order in the form of a de - crease of transportation charges, which would inure to the benefit, not of those aggrieved, but only of those who buy and use street railway transportation. If it be true, as contended by counsel for the city, that the net earn - ings of the lighting plant are 22 per cent., and the power plant 60 per this would indicate either that the rates charged for light and power are excessively high or that the electrical energy which the rail - ninpany furnishes for heating and lighting purposes is not remuner- If the heat and light which are being furnished to these sub - sidiary linee of business are furnished by the railway company at a rate that is not compensatory to it. the Commission has jurisdiction and authority to d&gt; n that respect by adjusting such charges. If the charges are excessive to the consumers of light and heat, the city council alone has jurisdiction over that matter and is able to furnish adequate relief through regulatory ordinance. The Railway Commission feels competent, and is willing, to regulate the rates and charges for transiHirtation and the rates and charges which the corporation shall receive in return for the light or heat which it furnishes for these aux - iliary lines of business, but it declines to usurp the authority of the city council and fix rates and charges over which it has no jurisdiction by - reducing fares for transportation, based upon the net earnings of the combined business of the Traction company as a common carrier, and the Traction company engaged in other lines of business outside of transportation. </seg>
            <seg id="p142">138 THIRD ANNUAL REPORT Furthermore, even though the Commission's powers were extended to include the regulation of public utilities, such as light, power and beat, it would be essential to segregate the capital invested in each of the several departments of the Traction company, and the earnings and expenses thereof, before it could undert&amp;ke to fix reasonable rat. any one or all of such departments. This principle is fundamental and has repeatedly been followed by the Railroad Commission of Wisconsin, which has jurisdiction over public utilities other than common carriers and is recognized as one of the foremost authorities in the country on such matters.

Secretary [SEAL I REPORT AND ORDER ON REDUCTIl CING METHODS H. J. WINNETT, Commissioner The complaint in this case alleges discrimination against Havelock and in favor of other suburbs, the rate being 5 cents single fare or six ticket* for 25 cents over the entire lines of defendant except to Havelock, where 10 cents is the single fare or four tickets for a quarter. Defendant filed its answer and cross-petition alleging that the rates charged at present, not only in Havelock, but in Lincoln and suburbs, were non - compensatory The Cities of Lincoln and University Place and the Vil - lage of College View intervened with a prayer that the rates they now enjoy be not disturbed. At a previous hearing on the same complaint in the fall of 1908. the Commission ordered the rate reduced from 10 cents straight to four tickets for 25 cents. At this hearing it developed that the earnings be - tween University Place and Havelock for a period of six months were S5.578.uu, while for the same period in 1907 they were $7,:U0.00. Reports calculated to show results of this reduction were ordered filed monthly with the Commission, and the evidence at the present hearing was to the </seg>
            <seg id="p143">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 139 effect that business had increased under same to such an extent that a revenue of about $ &gt;er annum was being collected. The income on this line per car hour is $2.41, which when compared with other lines of the system, proves to be the largest with perhaps one exception. Havelock is purely an industrial community; the railroad shops have been recently doubled in capacity and the population largely increased. Many of the employes in the industries there reside in Lin - coln and must go to and from their work over this line. The citizens of Havelock do much of their trading in Lincoln, and it is the belief of this Commission that they are entitled to the same rate that College View enjoys, the difference in distance from a Lincoln center being .88 of a mile. The questions involved by the intervention of the City of Lincoln are: ( 1 ) The reasonable value on which defendant should be permitted to earn. (2) The amount it should earn. (3) What is a reasonable charge for the service rendered? When the matter of reasonable rates was before this Commission in City of Lincoln r. Lincoln Traction Ok el al (formal complaint No. 3), it was found that 5 cent* for single fare, or six tickets for 26 cents, would bring a fair return to the company. At that time the Traction company and the "White line" (Citizens' Street Railway Company) were operated separately and independently, and had they continued to be so operated it is possible that conditions now existing would be different so far as the old Lincoln Traction Company is concerned. But they con - solidated in February, 1909, and when the matter was presented to this . ummission we found that the action had been in accordance wltb the law. There can be no question but what the citizens company, by its »ett»ti in taking over the Lincoln Traction Company, was relieved of some of its burdens, but at the same time it very materially benefited its patrons by giving additional service and universal transfers. There may have been some duplication of construction and there may now be now duplication of service, when viewed from the standpoint of the average man of affairs, but the demand for it came from the public, and the demand for its continuance was well demonstrated when it was re - cently suggested by the city attorney of Lincoln that a saving in operat - ing expenses could be made by abandoning the Twelfth street line. Ktarting with the value fixed in 1907 (formal complaint No. 3) as rning basis on the two systems now comprising The Lincoln Trac- Company, and adding thereto such amounts as are considered r charge* to capital that have since then been expended on the«e lines, including all of the power house and equipment, we find the present value of the property as a going concern, on which the company should be permitted to earn reasonable dividends (if by so doing the Kcan be served at a rate that is a customary and reasonable one If), to be $2,160,000.00. The Commission is confronted by a perplexing situation in determin- </seg>
            <seg id="p144">140 THIRD ANNUAL REPORT ing the second question. At the hearing in 1907 the question of fixing rates was considered only so far as the old Lincoln Traction Company wm concerned. The allowing indicated that it had been managed in a very conservative manner so far as extensions and capitalization were concerned, making the earnings such as to justify the Commission's action in reducing fares to six tickets for 25 cents. Previous to the organization of the Commission, the city council had PMMd an ordinance requiring the street railway lines in the city to sell six tickets for 25 cents; the Citizens' company complied with the provis - ions of that ordinance, but the Traction company procured a restraining order from the court. About this time the council also passed another ordinance levying an occupation tax of 5 per cent, on gross earnings of street railway companies, but this tax was not in force and was not con - sidered as an item of expense in establishing the six-for-a-quarter rate of iy&lt;i7. In the meantime this Commission had been given jurisdiction over • matter of rates, and the City of Lincoln filed its complaint asking for • reduction contemplated by the ordinance. The Citizens company, as reviously stated, had made no resistance to the ordinance, although its arnings were not sufficient to warrant assuming the added burden. This policy may have been an important factor, however, in bringing about condition by which it was enabled to absorb the older and company Hence, the real situation Is that of a company not resisting e establishment of a non-compensatory rate, taking over a sir company doing business at the same rate and making earnings sir' a fair return, but not sufficient to tirint idated company up to a profitable basis. As the Commission views the situation, there has been some con - struction of street railway lines not justified by the density of traffic. but built at the earnest solicitation of the general public and for the development of suburbs, and if by charging a fair and customary rate they cannot at the present time earn at In on the investment, they should look to future earnings for relief. In considering the income from operation, the Commission has been painstaking and thorough. It has not based its findings on what has actually been done in the past, but has applied to the income from March 1, 1909, to February 25, 1910, such divisions as are deemed proper for the future, or until such time as experience shall demonstrate that they should be changed. Earnings In estimating the probable income for the ensuing year, we have taken the operating income for the year following the consolidation and added thereto an amount to be derived from the lighting and heating plants equal to 2V4 cents per kilowatt hour for current consumed by these subsidiary departments, basing our calculations on last year's out - pat, same to be measured by meter at the power plant. Tlie income of the Traction company from the heating plant </seg>
            <seg id="p145">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 141 tound should be 27 cents on each 1,000 pounds of condensation as ■MMured by the consumers' meters. Our figures represent the income based on last year's output. the fairness of the 2V^ cents per kilowatt hour, our calcu- a have been confirmed by investigations of the Wisconsin Com- m, which has taken eleven steam plants in Wisconsin and thirty- fnur steam plants in Massachusetts and arrived at the same result. The result of these calculations, when applied to this case, is as follows: Gross income from operation. $463,080.00 k' from current furnished lighting department •■&gt;, 942.00 Income from current furnished power department 18,527.00 Income from steam heating department 17,855.00 Total income $550,404.00 ited loss by reduction of Havelock fare to six-for-a - quarter 12,595.00 $537,809.00 Expenses, nve found that there should be set apart a fund to be ex- pended for maintenance and depreciation equal to 5 per cent, on the depreciable property, and have fixed $1,600,000.00 as a basis for this account. In a recent case in Wisconsin the Commission fixed the per- centage for this purpose at 5.34 per cent. This allowance is very much below what the Massachusetts street railways use for the same purpose. and we believe if error has been committed it is on the side of conserva- tism. The result follows, based on last year's expenses. Operating expenses, exclusive of maintenance. ... $310,224.00 Amount set apart for maintenance and depreciation 80,000.00 Occupation tax (estimates vary from $14,000.00 to $18,000.00) li.n General taxes, based on present assessment Total expenses $432,724.00 or 4.8 per cent on value of plant as found by the Commission. It will be seen that the income of the street railway has been largely increased by credits not heretofore made, and may be in excess of an amount that can be justified after a year of practical operation. These credits are for service furnished the lighting, power and heating departments, and are based upon rates • ider equitable. It was contended by the city attorney of Lincoln that there should be an increase in income of S'&lt; compelling defendant to operate the express line now leased to and operated by the Morris Transporta- tion Company. The Morris Transportation Company's report, filed in this office for the year ending June 30, 1909, shows gross earnings of $10,397.50. with expenses amounting to $10,155.55. leaving a net income to the company of $241. 9r&gt;. This report is made under oath by the treas- urer, Mr. R. W. McGinnis, and the Commission cannot see its way clear to adopt the city attorney's views. </seg>
            <seg id="p146">142 THIRI 1. REPORT Another proposal by the city attorney of Lincoln to distribute $10,000.00 left unexpended in the depreciation account at the close of the year, a* dividends, does not appeal to the Commission. We insist that the integrity of this account must be maintained and that it shall be expanded in accordance with the provisions made tor same. As to reducing expenses, the Commission has recommended the abolishing of certain salaries, and the only other item in the budget which could be lllsps— »d with is one over which we have no control, namely, the occupation tax. It should be remembered that the occupa - tion tax ordinance was pa— ed at a time when the regular street car fare in Lincoln was I cents, and may have been to a certain extent a retaliatory measure for the refusal of the company to reduce the rate. Having, through the assistance of this Commission, secured an exceptionally low rate for street car service, which benefit is enjoyed equally by all patrons of the traction lines, K seems unfair to further reduce the revenues of the company to a non-compensatory basis by levy - ing an occupation tax. That the company is not receiving a fair return on the actual value of its property, and that the present showing discourages capital invest - ment, there can be no doubt This is purely a mathematical problem, capable of demonstration to anyone willing to lay aside prejudice and ba*e judgment on facts. The Commission will, for the present, defer action as to relief from this unfortunate situation and will hold in abey - ance any ruling in that regard. The Commission will hold, however, that, regardless of financial em - barrassment to the company, the existing discrimination against Have - lock must be removed, and that until such time as it may be found practicable to establish zone rates for the city of Lincoln and surround - ing suburbs, the Havelock rate should not be higher than the rate to other suburbs whose lines possess less earning power.

Subsequent to the filing of the said complaint, a resolution adopted c mayor and e I of Schuyltr. and a petition signed ■) ninety business men and farmers residing in Schuyler and virinii questing the construction and maintenance of the said transfer track. was filed. A bearing was had and from the evidence it appeared that, with the exception of • hay barn and a beer vault located on the tracks of the Burlington, all the industries having trackage facilities at Schuyler were located on the tracks of tl transfer switches connecting the defendants' lines at Fremont, twe nine and three-tenths miles east of Schuyler. and at Columbus, fifteen an&lt; eight-tenths miles west of S&lt; ion Pacific; that the en tire carload traffic which would be handled over the proposed transfer track consisted of shipments either deetinating or originating a' - or of grain shipped in by either road, milled in transit, and shipped oat over the same road which brought it in. It further appeared that the main, if imt the sole, purpose complainants and the skippers of carload freight at this point, was to avoid the expense of drayage transfer charges from the Burlington tracks to their places of bwsls»ss, located on the Union Pacific tracks. Complainant's witness Ehrenberger testified that by reason of th crop shortage on the line of the Union Pacific, and the so-called "Pane wheat market," they were compelled, in order to keep their mill running to secure 102 cars of wheat and two cars of rye from Burlingtn during the year 1909; that this grain was carried on a milling in trans! privilege, with an added back haul charge of 2 cents per hundred pounds that this milling in transit privilege and back haul rate on gram originat ing at Burlington points was accorded with the understanding th complainant would ship out over the Burlington rails either grain o finished product equaling, pound for pound, the as* &lt;1 in; tha under normal crop conditions, and as long as wheat cculd b&lt; along the line of the Union Facific, the complainant would not ship iu grain over the Burlingon, not only on account of the drayage charges but on account of the added 2-cent back haul charge; that the compan had occasion to ship in grain from Burlington territory on account o similar conditions only once in every three or four years; that the dray age charges on a 1,000-bushel car of grain from the Burlington tracks t complainant's mill, and the return of an equal amount of finished pro - duct from the mill to the said tracks, amounted to $12 50 per car; that </seg>
            <seg id="p153">149 occasionally complainant was unable to secure sufficient teams to do its dray in« and that consequent demurrage charges accrued; that if the said transfer tracks were constructed and cars were switched between com- plainant's mill and the Burlington tracks at a reasonable rate ("could afford to pay $2.00 per car"), complainant could pay more for its grain, with a resulting advantage to the farmer. It further appeared that other shippers of lumber, building supplies, coal and grain might occasionally have bought or sold those commodities in carload lots, under certain conditions, if a transfer track at Schuyler were available, but that in any case such truffle would have originated or destinateii at their places of business in Schuyler. Mr. George P. Bissell. secretary and treasurer of the Hord Grain Company, testified that when crop conditions were normal, a transfer track would be of no advantage, but that when crop conditions were poor in the south it might open up a special market for possibly 10 per rt. of their Schuyler business, by reason of premium bids from millers. There nowhere appears in the evidence any statement on which to the belief that any carload through traffic (i. e. traffic originating at points beyond Schuyler on one road, destined to points beyond Schuy- ler on the other road) would pass over the proposed transfer track. Com - plainant's witness Bhrenberger, when asked "What is the probability of such traffic moving?" answered "I couldn't say. When we consider the location of Schuyler with reference to the primary markets, the close proximity of transfer tracks at Columbus and Frem mnot but conclude that the probabilities of such traffic are so slight as to preclude serious consideration. The statute covering cases of this kind provides: All railroad companies in this state, at all points of connection, intersection or crossing at grade of different railroads, where it Is prac- P. .ill provide reasonable, ample and equal facilities, by track lection, passenger platforms, and otherwise for transferring cars, engers and property between their respective roads without un - onable dehi I any place where the tracks of the two railroad panies are within 500 feet apart, whether on the same grade or not, practicable and deemed reasonably necessary, the State Rail- fc;:on the application of any interested person, may re - track connection. All such railroad companies shall not dis- criminate in their rates or charges between such connecting lines or on freight coming over them; but no such company shall be required to furnish to another railroad company its tracks, equipment or terminal facilities without reasonable compensation." (Section 30-a, article 1, rpter 72. Wheeler's Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1909.) unsel for complainant insist that the provisions of the act are mandatory, and that the Commission has no discretion in the premises. For the provisions of this case, we may assume that this contention is correct if, under the facts stated, there is a connection, intersection or crossing of the two railroads, within the meaning of the statute. The railroads complained of in this action admittedly do not intersect or cross. Does the fact that the right-of-way and track of the Burlington </seg>
            <seg id="p154">150 \ xl 1 r\ XJ J%f%&amp;% Kj A 1 1* x\xj * C/ rC X road abut* on and meets the right-of-way of the Union Pacific constitute a connection within the meaning of the statute? We think not. Webster's defines "connection" as the "act of connecting; or state of being connected; junction; union; alliance; relationship. That which connects or joins together; bond; tie." We are of the opinion that the term "connection," as used in the above statute, means track connection. The right-of-way of the defendant roads abut, but the railroads, as an operating entity, which must include track, do not form a junction. This construction is given added force by construing the clause in question in the light of and together wtih the following clause, to-wi: "and at any place where the tracks of the railroad companies are within 500 feet apart, whether on the same grade or not, etc." The rights-of - way of railroads vary from 100 to 500 feet in width. Oftentimes they run parallel and are contiguous, and the tracks may be 100 feet or more apart. If complainant's contention is correct, it is mandatory upon the railroads and the duty of the Commission to compel the construction and maintenance of a transfer switch where the several rights-of-way are contiguous and the tracks a distance of 500 feet apart, while if the rights-of-way happen to be separated by land owned by a third party, though U»e tracks be only fifty feet apart, the question of requiring the co— traction of a transfer track becomes discretionary with the Com - mission Such a construction produces a result which, -on its face, is unreasonable, unjust and, to say the least, inconsistent and inharmonious. It is a general rule, in construing statutes, that that construction is favored which gives effect to every clause and every part of the statute, thus producing a consistent and harmonious whole; and, further, that where the wiling of a statute is doubtful, the construction most agree - able to reason and justice should be adopted as the intention of the legis - lature, for it will not be presumed that the legislature contemplated un - reason or injustice. To hold that the provision of the statute in question means a track m— ei this], intersection or crossing, frees it from any liability to criti - ciam of being Inharmonious, inconsistent or unjust. So holding, it be - comes the duty of the Commission, it appearing that the tracks are only fifty feet apart, to determine whether the construction of the transfer track is practicable and reasonably necessary. The tracks are virtually on the same grade, and can be connected by a transfer track of some 800 feet in length, at a cost of not exceeding $2,500.00, exclusive of cost of right-of-way. The land necessary for a right-of-way for such transfer track is vacant to the east of the Burling - ton's present right-of-way. There is not sufficient evidence to determine definitely as to what its reasonable cost would be. We therefore find that the construction of the track in question is practicable. Is it reasonably necessary? It cannot be deemed so unless there be a reasonable amount of traffic offered by the public for transpor - tation, which the defendants are obliged to accept and transport Such traffic would consist of shipments originating at points beyond Schuyler </seg>
            <seg id="p155">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 151 on oae road, destined to points beyond Schuyler on the other road. The evidence does not disclose that there would be any traffic of this character, and, as previously stated, considering the nearness of trans - remont and Columbus, it is very doubtful it there would be a. affic at all it would appear that almost all, if not all, the the proposed transfer track would be trmfic originating or destinating at Schuyler. This traffic would come down in the case of Louisville d- ' 32, wherein it was held that r to accept goods tendered at its station doe* ■i offered by competing roads at arbitrary uiuus for the purpose of using its terminal station. A law re^ .t trier so to do is unconstitutional as taking le process of law.' suggest in their brief that The purpose for which such switch might be used after it is put in, is a question which does not arise, and need not be considered at this time." And again, "It thus appears that the power of the legislature to compel rail - roads to put in a transfer switch at points of connection is once estab - lished, it is quite probable that coercive measures to compel defendants to do business with each other at Schuyler as they do elsewhere under like circumstances will not be necessary." We cannot agree with counsel that the Commission should arbitrarily impel defendants to expend their money for the con - struction of such a switch, under the ciieumstances as they appear in this case, in the hope that by the exercise of some "coercive measure," the nature of which is not disclosed, the defendants can be forced to handle traffic which, under the law as above quoted, they cannot be re - quired to accept. For the foregoing reasons, the Commission finds that the construction of a transfer track between the railroads of the defendant companies at Schuyler is not reasonably necessary- If the Commission's construction of the statute is wrong, and the duty resting on the defendants is man- datory, complainant still has his relief by an appeal. In that event, the burden of securing affirmative relief at the hands of the court remains with the complainant and does not shift to the Commission, as has invariably occurred when defendant carriers have appealed from orders of this Commission granting affirmative relief.

CommiMitMT This is a complaint filed July lu, lyotf, by the Norfolk Long Distance Telephone Company against the Nebraska Telephone Company, alleging refusal on the part of defendant to furnish telephone service to com - plainant by installing one of its telephones in the office of the com - plainant, the contention being that as a common carrier and subject to the laws of Nebraska governing common carriers, the defendant should Kb complainant in like manner as individuals and other corpor- The contention of the defendant is that the complainant being in the same business as defendant, there is no provision in the law compelling it to furnish such service to complainant. The evidence introduced by the complainant and given by Mr. W. J. Stadelnian. the manager of the complainant company, was to the effect that on application of said W. J. Stadelman, made to the defendant about May, 1908, for the installation of a telephone in his office, the same was installed and paid for at the regular business rate fixed by the defendant until July, 1909, at which time the telephone was removed without notice. Mr. 9tadelman stated that he then went to the local office of the defendant and made legal tender to its agent of the rent for telephone service for the month of July, 1909, and requested that the instrument be reinstalled, which request was refused. He then made a written demand for the service and tendered the amount of the monthly rental to the agent of the defendant, which was refused, the agent giving as his reason therefor that the general manager of the defendant company had ordered the removal of the instrument and discontinuance of the ser\ ice kMr. Stadelman also testified as to the inconvenience caused him by inability to secure the service of defendant, giving specific instances rein his business relations had been hampered, and names of indi- viduals in connection therewith. ton cross examination by the defendant's counsel, Mr. Stadelman ad - ed that he was manager of the Norfolk Long Distance Telephone pany. the complainant herein; that he owned about $13,000.00 of the k of said company; that the telephone instrument of the defendant company was installed in the same room in which the long distance switchboard of the complainant was located, and that the said instru - ment was used for the purpose of communicating with towns and indi - viduals which could not be reached by the service of complainant, both for local and long distance calls. An effort was made by counsel for defendant to show by cross ex - amination of the witness to what extent the telephone service of de - fendant was used for the personal business of the witness, and to what extent for the business of the complainant, with which he is connected. There was no denial on the part of the witness that he used said service at any and all times when the same was necessary in connection with his business as manager of the complainant company.

Section 10 in substance provides that a complaint may be made to the Commission concerning any default of a carrier, whereupon notice shall be given the carrier, a hearing had, and then the Commission may enter such an order as may be Just and reasonable, and a copy thereof shall be served on the railway company, to become effectual within ten days thereafter unless a later date is named in the order. mplainant has filed his complaint and the defendant has been served with a copy thereof, and a hearing and investigation duly had in the Manner provided for in said section 10. Defendant contends that said section 10 is absolutely void and un - constitutional if it is interpreted as conferring upon the Commission the power to investigate alleged violations of law by a common carrier, and to decide whether or not the alleged acts are in reality violations of law, for the reason that such a proceeding calls for the exercise of judicial functions, and that such functions can be exercised only by the courts, and cannot be conferred upon any other department of government." t Counsel for defendant cited many cases dealing with the separation the powers and functions of government into the three departments, islative. administrative or executive, and judicial. The authorities sred by counsel, while instructive, do not cover the situation as pre - sented by the facts in this case. Admitting, for the sake of argument, that they might sustain the principle contended for, prior to the time of the adoption of the constitutional amendment creating the Commission, I am of the opinion that the provisions of such amendment can reasonably be construed to authorize the legislature to provide a different procedure in the matter of the regulation of common carriers than obtained prior to the adoption of said amendment and the enactment of the Railway Com - mission act and acts amendatory thereto. tint within the functions of the Commission to determine the istitutionality of any statute, and until said section 10 has been de - red unconstitutional by the courts of this state, we must follow the cedure. etc., presented therein. tin the case of State ex M Msn &lt; .

The court held that re spondent was a common carrier, offering to the public the use of its telephonic system for the rapid conveyance of oral messages, and, as such, was subject to the duty of serving all persons alike, impartially and without unreasonable discrimination, and that the right to equal facili ties for the use of such public system extended to telegraph companies, as well as to individuals. The court in its opinion cites with approval the cases above cited, and aiamases the application and ruling made by the Supreme Court of tbe United States in the Exprttt Cats ill relied on by coun - sel in that case, as is done by counsel in the present case, as a complete defense to the relief asked for. &lt;-uit Judge Wales, after stating the facts at issue in the Kxpntt Osast and quoting from the opinion delivered by Chief Justice Waite. "The reasons assigned for the decision in the A .•** d not apply, even remotely, to the right of telephone companies to mak (•criminations by special contract in the transmitting of mnsssgnt n the first place, the relator is not asking for any special accommoda on or service from the respondent, but for such facilities only as ar iven by the latter to the general public and to the Western I 'elegrapti Company. These fac now a&lt; I other common carriers of every kin :ig telegraph companies e respondent is requested to do nothing more for the relator than t does for all of its patrons and subscribers. For want of a sufneien rolling stock, a railroad company may be unable to accommodate mor than one express company on a single train. A telephone compa ■at prevented by any deficiency of appliances or of instruments from giving the same service to all, and, finally, it is not claimed by the re - spondent that it cannot serve the relator in like manner as it does thers without inconvenience or delay to the public." Applying tbe rules previously quoted to our statute, and following the principles laid down in the cases cited, and particularly in the last case cited, the reasoning of which we believe to be Bound and just, I cannot escape the conclusion that defendant's refusal and failure to furnish the complainant with telephone service such as is accorded all other patrons, constitutes a violation, not only of the provisions of sec - tion 11, chapter 89-a, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1907, heretofore Pted, but comes within the inhibition of paragraph a of section 14 of Commission act, which provides: "If any railway company or common carrier, subject to the pro- </seg>

The case cited and statutes interpreted hold that unless a specific statutory provision obtains to the contrary, telephone companies and tele - graph companies under the law are alike and subject to like treatment. Defendant's Norfolk directory, filed as an exhibit in this case, dis - closes the fact that defendant is furnishing the Western Union Telegraph Company with its service at Norfolk. That the defendant is furnishing the telegraph companies with telephone service at its various exchanges throughout the state, and that the telegraph companies are using this service for the transmission of messages, etc., is a matter of such com - mon knowledge that the Commission can properly take Judicial notice thereof That the telegraph business is competitive with the telephone business, at least so far as its long distance business is concerned, no one can deny, and defendant cannot be permitted to refuse to furnish one competitor a service which it accords to another competitor, particularly when the facilities and service demanded are no more than the defend - ant furnishes to all of its patrons.

Mr. Bogue's testimony also was to the effect thai ■umls could not be loaded when the average was considered; it was probably a fair minimum for sheep but not fair for lambs. In fact, it was agreed by all of the witnesses for the plaintiff that 2:!,ooo pounds was too high a minimum, taking the shipments as they run It was also the opinion of all of the witnesses that conditions had changed in the last few years aa to the proportion of lamb and sheep shipments and that at the present time probably more than 50 per cent, of the shipment* arn lasaha, some of the witnesses placing it as high as 60 per cent. There were a number of exhibits introduced by the complainant. showing the weight per carload of sheep sold on the South Omaha </seg>

One shows that 224 carloads of sheep averaged 24,59(1 i&gt;ounds per car; the other gives the average on 222 loads of lambs to have been lT.noi pounds. In this example it is shown that the proportion of lambs and sheep were about M per cent, each and the average weight per car, when both were considered, is about 21,250 pounds, which corresponds very closely to the average shipments of mixed lots as given in the other The defendant introduced no testimony at the hearing but later did tile a statement showing the minimum weight and actual weight on hogs at South Omaha for the month of August, 1909. This shows them to be ordinarily loaded above the minimum, and an exhibit filed by the com - plainant showing the shipments of cattle also shows the actual weight per car to be above the minimum, these exhibits corroborating the testimony of all of the witnesses. The Commission finds that the contention of the complainant is true, accord hit: to the testimony and exhibits that have been presented in this case, and that it is not practical to load to the minimum when all classes of sheep idered. ommission further finds that, considering mature sheep as dis- -miii lami omuls would be a fair minimum and that lambs, being a commodity of greater value than sheep (the testimony showing the ralue to be fron per cent, more), should, in justice K carrier, take a higher rate. It is a well known fact that the value proi ;&gt;ed is always considered a factor in the fixing of and i r the value the higher the rate, is almost the uni - rule. The only exception to this would be when the tonnage is inly large to justify a lower rate. We also find that it is imprac- Kd would lead to confusion and disputes to fix a different minimum bs than for sheep By lowering the minimum on sheep the earn - the carrier would be reduced per carload on lambs, while on ma- ture sheep it would probably be changed but little, if any. There has been no complaint of the rate charged, but the effect of reducing the minimum would be unquestioned. At the present time the rate on sheep from Wisner to South Omaha is 10.62 cents per hundredweight, but by t son of the complainant not being able to load the minimum, it costs i for this haul about 13 cents, hence the question arises whether this Is an unfair charge for the service rendered. </seg>
            <seg id="p170">166 THIRD ANNUAL REPORT By malting comparison with other stales of minima on sheep, we find that Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Wyoming, Kansas, Arkansas, Colorado and Oklahoma have the same minimum as is used in Nebraska, while Illinois has a much lower minimum and a higher rate. The rate for 100 miles In Illinois is 14.4 cents, making the amount received by the carriers par oar $24.48, while in Nebraska, if the shipper fails to load to the mini - mnm and only loads 18,000 pounds, while he pays for 22,000 pounds, his car costs him, for the same distance that the Illinois shipment was car - ried, $35.23, or 75 cents per car more. Should each shipment in Illinois and Nebraska be loaded to 22,000 pounds, the Illinois shipper would pay $28.80 per car while the Nebraska shipper would pay $25.23, or $3.57 per car less. Applying the above calculation to a 200-mile shipment, the rate in Illinois is 18.3 cents, and in Nebraska, 14.02 cents. For the minimum, a car in Illinois would pay $31.11, and in Nebraska, $30.82; but should the Illinois shipper load to the Nebraska minimum, the 200-mile ship - ment would cost him $40.26 against $30.82 to the Nebraska shipper. The rates la the states named where the minimum is the same as Nebraska, are practically the same or more than the Nebraska rates, with the excep - tion of Iowa, which is less. While to the Commission it seems an unfair proposition for a mini - mum to be so high as to make full loading impossible, we belie\ increased marketing of lambs has brought about this condition, and that, it not being practicable to fix a different minimum for lambs than for cheep, and lambs being a more valuable commodity than sheep, the Increased rate resulting from the minimum so fixed is not imm ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railw;, mission that the above complaint be, and the samp is, hereby dismissed.

Copy of the petition was served upon defendant in the usual man - ner, to which it answered with a general denial of the Commission's jurisdiction in the premises. There can be no doubt about the Commission's lack of jurisdiction, and the only question is whether the case is of sufficient importance to justify an appeal to the Interstate Commerce Commission under sub - division q, section 2, Railway Commission act. The territory affected by this complaint is very limited, and as the general question of southern lumber rates has recently been before the Interstate Commerce Commis- B. d- Q. R. It Cii. t ( al C.

Suggestions as to the Improvement of the car service within and about the city of Lincoln, lai ax to immediate and temporary relief, and (b) a permanent betterment of the sen On December 11, 1909, we presented the letter you furnished us to Mr. Sharpe, president of The Lincoln Traction Company, and were cor - dially received and informed that all data we wished was at our dis - posal. A resume of the traction situation was gone over by Mr. Sharpe and he expressed a desire on the part of the company to improve the conditions within any reasonable requirement, and would be glad to co - operate in any manner suggested by the Commission. Going from Mr Sharpe s office to the office of the general manager of the Traction company, there was submitted to us by Mr. Humpe data as to power con - ditions, as well as contracts providing for certain additions to their power plant. Mr Humpe fully explained the difficulties under which they had undertaken to operate their cars and plant, in an endeavor to carry out a plan providing a greater number of car miles than their facilities would justify. A visit to the power house was made I termine conditions there. In discussing the power plant as a whole, we have deemed visable to separate same into two divisions, ill boiler room, 12) engine and generating room We will treat now of the boiler room.

All of these openings above the crates would permit cold air to enter, reducing the efficiency of the boil- </seg>
            <seg id="p173">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 169 ers to a considerable extent. We learned that these boilers had not be«B rly cared (or for the past three or four months, this condition being occasioned by a continued demand (or the full boiler capacity, since the entire car operation in Lincoln has depended on this plant, and no available time has been had (or properly cleaning and caring for same. We have been informed since our visit to the plant on Saturday, that on Sunday night last one battery of the B. * W. boilers was cut out, and that such needed brick work repairs were begun, leaving on Monday morning a rated horse power under fire of 1,756. The fuel used at the time of our visit to the plant was Pitts-burg slack coal, a variety of fuel designed to meet the condition of economy and service, where a steam plant is only worked to its normal capacity. We will now treat of the engine and generating room which contains the following equipment: One Jennings 4 valve high speed compound non-condensing engine, generator 2.300 volts. aid Corliss f, running 90 revolutions, ' connected to i 125 K W. direct current dynamo lit S rising. 100 revolutions, to a 910 ai i front generator.

P., each belted to prnating generators, being out of use capacity not determined. the above exception, all of the engines and generators are ra - il in service, and seem to be in good working condition, as well as ulental apparatus, including rotary converter, exciters, switch - he engine and generating division of the plant has a 990 rated capacity devoted to lighting purposes, and a 850 K. W. •■n l. voted to traction purposes, and by the use of the rotary I i lighting current to the extent of 325 K. W. capacity can be ta direct current for traction purposes. So far we have out - cal construction of the power plant, and now will under - take to state the method of operation employed during our investigation. Owing to the rush in traction service, and to the turning on of the rommercial lighting in the early evening hours between 5:00 and 6:30 peak load is caused at this time, and owing to the diminished boiler capacity, the following practices had to be employed in order to provide against a probable shutting down of the plant: Ex - cepting the steam turbine, all of the engines exhaust into one common exhaust pi pe being fitted with a lever throttle valve that allows the operator to put a back pressure on these engines, sufficient to force the exhaust steam into the commercial heating mains about the city. It was learned that as high as ten pounds back pressure was demanded within the last few days in order to supply the heating plant. We arrived about 4:00 o'clock p. m. at the plant, and at this time the two Corliss engines (with a back pressure of six pounds on for heating </seg>
            <seg id="p174">170 THIRD ANNUAL REPORT purposes) mod the steam turbine were carrying the traction load, and the steam turbine in connection with the Jennings engine was carrying the lighting load. About 5:00 o'clock p. m. the commercial lighting load Legan to materially increase, and it became necessary to throw all the street railway load onto the two Corliss engines, in order that the steam turbine could care for the commercial lighting. In order to handle this load on these two engines, however, it was necessary to reduce the exhaust back pressure to one pound, thereby greatly reducing the efficiency of the heating plant. All of the boilers feed steam into one M— hi header pipe, and all the engines receive their steam supply from this pipe at a working pressure of 150 pounds. The turbine engine must have a pressure of not less than 140 pounds. Not long after the traction load was placed upon the two Corliss engines, the steam pressure began to diminish. A cutting out process of the different street car circuits waa immediately employed, in order to prevent the steam pres - sure falling below a point where the turbine engine could be operated. This cutting out process of street car circuits is really cutting off the power of the different car lines over the city alternately, in short periods, thereby interrupting the service, and is done for the purpose of tem - porarily reducing the load on the engines, and thereby economizing steam so that the boilers may have opportm - I return the pressure back to normal. It may be incidentally remarked here that the im - mediate operators of the plant were putting forth their best efforts to ■ware a maximum output. To make a statement of traction operation in t! Lincoln, mention should be made of the number of cars scheduled to operate at the present time, as compared with one year ago, when two street railway companies were operating cars, the Citizens company operating ■f— tsw . while the Traction company was operating thirty-three. At the present time forty-six cars are scheduled to operate, belonging to the consolidated company. It will be seen by this statement that nearly the same traction power is being demanded now, as was required one year ago. At that time, however, the Citizens company's cars were being operated by power furnished by the Lincoln Gas ft Electric Light Com - pany. At the present date the Traction company is undertaking to supply power for the entire movement of cars. May 12, 1909, the Trac - tion company began supplying power to move the old Citizens company's cars, and just prior to this time the Lincoln Gas ft Electric Light Company was supplying power for the movement of the same cars to the extent of about 4,000 kilowatts per diem. Prom the date this addi - tional load was placed upon the power plant of the Traction company, in our opinion, the boiler capacity of the plant has been taxed beyond its normal limit. We have been reliably informed that the operating officials made an early request for proper addition to this portion of the plant The boiler now being installed was contracted for from the manufacturers September 11, 1909. Considering the urgent need of improvement in the street car sit- </seg>
            <seg id="p175">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 171 uation in and about Lincoln, we have made an investigation of the power and generating capacity of the Lincoln Gas &amp; Electric Light Company's plant, in order to determine if any relief could be secured from that source. We are informed that no additional machinery has been installed in the gas company's plant since it was relieved of the Citizens com - pany's load, and it was declared by officers of this company that they had maintained their plant in a normal service condition, and that they have gradually increased the commercial lighting and power load suffi- cient to nearly equal the output formerly consumed by the Citizens company's cars. A statement from the head engineer of the gas com- pany's power plant shows the following boilers now in service 2 CaldwelU with automatic stoker 500 H. P. 1 Heine, with automatic stoker 250 H.

From the above statement of facts it is apparent that no considerable relief from the present traction power difficulties can be obtained from this source. During our conversation at the gas company's office, we learned that that company has on hand at the present time about 500 tons of Youghiogheny steam coal, of which pertinent suggestion will be made later. From an examination of the annual reports now on file in the office of the Commission, it Is found that at the present time there are being operated more car miles in the city of Lincoln, considering the pas - sengers carried, than in any known city with like conditions. It might be well to mention in this connection, however, that the average size and capacity of the cars of The Lincoln Traction Company is leu than those existing in many other cities. Annual reports show that the earnings per car mile in Lincoln are 15.35 cents, while in Omaha, the only other Nebraska city provided with street railway service, the earn - ings are 27.63 cents per car mile. These reports further show that the operating expenses in Lincoln per car mile are 10.19 cents, while in Omaha the expenses per car mile are 13.S3 cents. The above figures are taken from the five months' operation of the The Lincoln Traction Company's cars after the consolidation. These figures reflect the effects of carrying on the street railway traffic in Lincoln, and it will be in - teresting to know that in Omaha there are carried, per revenue ear mile, 6.66 people, while in Lincoln there are only carried 3.61 persons per revenue car mile. Another pertinent question to this investigation. </seg>
            <seg id="p176">172 THIRD ANNUAL REPORT and a fact well substantiated by experience and statistics, is that a traction railway plant operating at nearly full load under favorable weather conditions, must be prepared to augment its output under storm conditions, such as recently experienced, to an extent of from 15 per cent, to 45 per cent, and The Lincoln Traction Company's plant was not so equipped. That the present management is using all en - deavors to operate the power plant to its full capacity is certain, and to blame it altogether for conditions, or any of the past managements in particular, is hardly justifiable, in our opinion. The present cir - cumstances have largely been allowed to grow with the upkeep and ex- pansion of the property, and are not wholly unknown in principle and effect in other local In order to briefly summan its as above outlined we submit to you the follow) enced by the citizens of Lincoln isioned by ire for Third Substantiated b Light Company's pow&lt; or assist. -■- ot be cor present • ment is being stnrn nditions. a m&lt; of which will return th« a more satisfactory stage Fifth.

' • ■•..■-. l.s'nnlicin of competition, inadequate service, insolence of officers for refusing to deal with their employes as a union instead of individuals, and furnishing and marketing light and power not :. j d for in their articles of incorporation. This complaint came up for hearing December 23. 19(i9, and the testi - corroborated a great deal of information that was already in the emission and was of common knowledge, having been free - -cussed and disseminated through the public press. The prayer of the petitioner is that said consolidation or merger be canceled and set aside; that stocks and bonds issued subsequent to said merger be canceled; that said company be estopped from doing business not provided in its charter. I'pon consideration of the pleadings and evidence, the Commission finds That previous to February 1, 1909, the Lincoln Traction Com- </seg>
            <seg id="p178">174 THIRD ANNUAL REPORT pany and the Citizen* Street Railway Company were competing street railway lines operating in the city of Lincoln Second: That on or about February 1, 1909, said companies con - solidated, thereby giving to the citizens of Lincoln a better service and the advantage of universal transfers. Third: That in making this consolidation said companies acted un - der authority conferred by a law passed by the legislature of Nebraska, which became effective February 12, 1889, being chapter 38, section 6, Baaaton Laws of Nebraska for 1889, "An Act to enable street railways to unite their roads by consolidation, purchase, sale or subscription to or purchase of capital stock, ei Fourth: That the combined value of these properties, for rate-mak - ing purposes, at the time of the consolidation, excluding franchise value, was in the neighborhood of $2,000,006.00 and that there was issued stock and bonds to the amount of about $1,500,000.00 in excess of the physical valuation. Fifth: We find, while the law contemplates and the courts sustain the proposition, that earnings can only be based on a reasonable value of the actual property, when considered as a growing concern, franchise value not being permitted to participate, and that reasonable rates are made the predominating factor in arriving at proper earnings. No fraud has been perpetrated on the general public. Sixth : We find that at the time this complaint was filed there was insHisqnstr service, but that previous to the hearing the Commission, on its own initiative, instructed it.- engineers to make investigation as to its cause and recommendations with a view at correcting the same, which they did. and as a result of such procedure the service has been greatly improved and betterments are still being made. Seventh: We find that the city of Lincoln through its council, by ordinance, granted The Lincoln Traction Company permission to do sMlmt for power and lighting purposes, reserving the right to fix maxi - mum rates for such service. For years the citizens of Lincoln have been enjoying the benefit of this service, and previous to this time the rights of the company to furnish it have not been questioned The commission believes that this is a purely judicial question and that the resisty is within reach of the mayor and city council, to exercise at any time they may deem it the best policy for the city of Lincoln, and accordingly refers this matter to the tender mercies of the city council. Eighth: In regard to the power of this Commission to cancel stocks and bonds, after much consideration and discussion by this board, the matter was referred to the Attorney General for his opinion, which has bean adopted by the Commission and is hereinafter set forth: "I am in receipt of your communication of recent date, submitting the following proposition and requesting an opinion thereon: " 'Is it within the jurisdiction of the Commission to order the cancellation of stock, or any portion thereof, of any consolidated company organized under and complying with the provisions of section 10671, Cobbey's Annotated Statutes for 1909, where such </seg>
            <seg id="p179">NEBRASKA RAILWAY COMMISSION 175 company has issued its stock to an amount in excess of the actual value of its properties?' "This question necessarily involves the consideration of powers con - ferred upon the Commission by the constitution and by the statutes of the state. The amendment to the constitution creating the State Rail - way Commission defines the powers and duties of said Commission to be as follows The powers and duties of such Commission shall include the regulation of rates, service and general control of common carriers ' legislature may provide by law. But in the absence of specific legislation the Commission shall exercise the powers and perform the duties enumerated in this provision.' 'oregoing it is apparent that the authority of the Railway Commission is inferior and subject to the power of the legislature over railroads and railroad companies upon all matters about which the legislature has taken legislative action. In recognition of this situation the legislature, at its first session after the adoption of this amendment and the election of the State Railway Commission, enacted chapter 90, Session Laws of 1907, creating and denning the powers, duties and qualifications of the Commission. Certain other acts have been passed - legislature conferring additional specific powers and duties upon iimmission. Among other acts is an act pased by the legislature of ISM, being chapter 108, Session Laws for that year, the title of which is 'An act regulating the issuance of stocks, bonds and other forms of indebtedness of common carriers and public service corporations, and King penalties for the violation thereof.' Neither in the Railway ission act. the constitutional amendment, nor in the act of 1909 referred to is direct authority attempted to be conferred upon the ission to cancel or order the cancellation of stocks issued by a corporation. The powers conferred upon the Commission by the con - stitutional amendment, the Railway Commission act and the act of are powers that partake more peculiarly of the nature of legislative and administrative than of judicial powers. &gt;&lt;)ii a careful examination of the constitutional amendment and the acts of the legislature referred to, it would seem reasonable to con - clude that the powers conferred upon the Railway Commission were for the most part administrative or supervisory. The amendment itself con - fers upon the Commission the legislative authority to regulate, which includes the right to fix and establish rates to be charged by railroad companies, but the other legislative or judicial powers which the Com - mission may have the right to exercise are only such as are ancillary or incidentally ne&lt; ■• carry into effect the other powers which are expressly granted. 'Section 1, article 2, constitution, provides as follows: The powers of the government of this state are divided into three distinct departments: the legislative, executive, and judicial. and no person or collection of persons, being one of these depart- ments, shall exercise any power properly belonging to either of the others, except as hereinafter expressly directed or permitted.' "Having due regard for this provision of the constitution, It neces - sarily follows that the Railway Commission is authorized to exercise such legislative powers as are conferred upon it by the constitutional amendment, supplemented by the action of the legislature, and such other legislative and judicial powers only as are incidentally necessary to enable it to perform the duties for which it was created. "The power to cancel the stock of corporations is distinctly a ju - dicial function, and is to be exercised by the judicial department rather </seg>
            <seg id="p180">176 THIRD ANNUAL REPORT than by a department of the government whose main function is exec - utive or administrative and clothed only with a limited or &lt;/i«i.«&lt;-judiciai authority. It has no express authority from the constitution or the statutes to cancel stock. It is doubtful if the legislature could confer upon the Commission, an administrative and a limited legislative body, a power which is so clearly a Judicial function, without impinging upon the section of ' rnment. "I- it was said by the Supreme Court of the United States, through Justice Field, as follows: " °Ttae distinction between a judicial and a legislative m well defined The one determines what the law is, and what the rights of parties ar ransactions already had; the other prescribes what the law shall be in future raxes arising under undertakes to determine a q right or obligation, or adation upon which lent a jm: The Suprei &gt;laU ex rtl Thntnp. 2&lt;T, had occasion to consider the division of the nestion Involved in that case mdges under section 55 of the Omaha charter to appoint park commissioners.

The appointment of an officer might properly, we think, be classed a* the exercise of an executive or administrative function; at least not judicial. Yet courts and judges frequently find it necessary to make such appoint - ments in order that the judicial functions of the courts may be freely exercised. It often happens that courts or judges are clothed with this appointing power where the appointee may not be required to discharge any duty which could be in any way ancillary to the exercise of the judicial functions art or judge making the appointment, and yet the validity of the appointment could not be successfully questioned, for the reason that the person appointed would exercise judicial functions in the discharge of the duties imposed under the appointment. We think, however, that we may safely say that the appointment of park commissioners for cities of the metropolitan class is not the exercise of a judicial function. It may not belong to either class, but it is clearly not judicial. We think also that the duties imposed upon the park commissioners cannot be said to call for the exercise of judicial functions \eb. 270-273.) •'In the foregoing tb&gt; &gt;ns upon one department of govern - ment to perform fui. at in a measure pertain to the duties of the other, are properly stated, and furnished a reasonable guide in the so - lution of the question presented by your inquiry". "The cancellation of the stock of a railroad company by the Commis - sion Is not an incidental necessity to the general powers of the Commis - sion to properly regulate and control such company. Even in the exercise of its power to fix rates, the authority to cancel stock is not incidentally necessary, since it has become a well-established proposition that the basis of all calculations as to the reasonableness of rates to be charged by a corporation maintaining a highway under legi&gt; sanction must be the fair value of the property being used by it for the convenience of the public' «, 169 U. 8. 464.) therefore reach the following conclusion and give the same as my opinion: That since the power of the Commission to cancel stock issued by a railway company is a judicial and not a legislative or admin - istrative function, since such power has not been granted to the Commis - sion by the constitution nor attempted to be conferred by the legislature. since the general powers of the Commission are not distinctively judicial and since the power to cancel stock is not an incidental necessity to the discharge of its general duties, it has no authority to cancel or to order the cancellation of corporate stock of a railway company previously is - sued.

The testimony offered by the complainant sustained the allegations made and the defendant produced no evidence that that there had ever been any rate other than a rate of $5.00 per car, previous to January 1. 190fi. at which time the rate of 4^4 c— to per hundredweight was substituted. of complainant also showed that previous to the can - in of the rate of $5.00 per car, there was moved from Woodlawn •ulii a considerable number of cars each year, but that since the cancellation of said rate, there had been no carload shipments of flour and feed from Woodlawn to Lincoln. • &lt;;• imantown branch of the Chicago, Burlington iicy railroad, and is about six miles from the city of Lincoln.

It is provided by section 7, article XI.. constitution, as follows: KThe legislature shall pass laws to correct abuses and prevent t discrimination and extortion in all charges of express, telegraph railroad companies in this state, and to enforce such laws by late penalties to the extent, if necessary for that purpose, of forfeiture of their property and franchises." </seg>
            <seg id="p186">182 THIRD ANNUAL REPORT Pursuant to this provision of the constitution, and the constitutional amendment creating this Commission, the legislature enacted the statute hereinbefore set forth. That act was to prevent unjust discrimination and preference and to place all shippers on an absolute equality with re - spect to rates. In the opinion of the Commission, to enforce the doctrine of estoppel contended tor by complainant, would render both the legis - lature and the Commission powerless to correct abuses and prevent un - just discriminations, the very things the constitution and the legislature were designed to prevent Under the application of the doctrine of estoppel, all unjust, preferential or discriminatory rates which had bee* established or granted for any considerable length of time, and claimed to have ripened into a vested right, could not be prevented or changed. In the view of the Commission, any contract, whereby any particular preference or advantage was conceded by the railroad companies to one shipper In preference to another with respect to rates, which were in the nature of a preference or advantage, will be presumed to have been made in contemplation of the power conferred upon the legislature by the constitutional provisions above cited, and must yield to an act of the legislature which declares the same to be unlawful. To grant the relief prayed for by complainant in this case would be to sanction or command that to be done which the Commission, under the law, was created and empowered to prevent being done. As affect - ing contracts discriminatory in character, made prior to the action of the legislature, the Supreme Court of this state in the case of ■. State Martyu.m N. W. 719, said: "The exercise of this power (that conferred by section 7, article XI. constitution) necessarily includes the right to interfere with contract and property rights, so far at least as may be necessary to prevent ex - tortion and discrimination." It Is the view of the Commission in this case that the rate asked by complainant to be restored is a preferential or discriminatory rate, and that the doctrine of estoppel cannot be properly invoked.

This complaint was Bled January I, IMv, by the Omaha Grain UK - change, a corporation of this state made up of corporations, co - partnership*, and individuals engaged in the business of buying, i - lag and shipping consignments of grain, with offices located in Omaha, Douglas county.

That the rates established to Kansas City, August 9, 1909, made a rate on corn, via that gateway, to all eastern markets than could be secured when shipped via Omaha, and that prior to that time the rates to Mississippi river crossings were the same, and in some instances less. via Omaha than via Kansas City I idence introduced by defendants shows 1 That the grain rates in Kansas were reduced by the legislature of that state on the basis of a maximum distance tariff; that on account of this legislative reduction, the rate on corn was reduced from Washington, Kansas, to Atcnison, Kansas, from 8.5 cents to 7.5 cents per hundred w.-is-ht hat the short line mileage via The Missouri Pacific Railway Com - pany from Washington. Kansas, to Atchison, Kansas, is 120 miles. That Atchison. Kansas, is a Missouri riyer common point, and that the same proportional rates on grain apply from there as apply from Kansas City ' Joseph. Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska. That the reduction in rates on grain from the stations in Ne - braska named by complainant to Kansas City, was occasioned by the de - sire of the defendant Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company itect train shippers located on its lines at Washington. Kansas, and points, as against the- rates made to the Missouri river crossing at -on by The Missouri Pacific Railway Company. 4. That the defendant Chicago. Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Com - pany has on its line of railroad between Washington. Kansas, and Atchi - ansas. a number of stations in Nebraska, which are intermediate be - tween the above named points, and from which it cannot carry a bighe'r grain rate than that which it was compelled to make from Washington, Kansas. That by reason of the compulsory rate reductions made by the de - fendant Chicago. Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company at Wymore and Blue Springs, Nebraska, the defendant Union Pacific Railroad Company was forced to meet the Chicago, Burlington ft Quincy reduction at its stations directly competitive. 6 That The St. Joseph ft Grand Island Railway Company does «ot operate a line of railroad reaching the Omaha market, and that said rail- </seg>
            <seg id="p194">190 THIRD ANNUAL REPORT road rwirnij is a strong competitor for shipments of grain via it* line to St. Joseph. Missouri, as against defendant carriers. 7. That during a period of five years prior to the rate reduction on August 9, 1*09, to Kansas City, the shipments of grain from the stations mentioned in the petition were approximately 1,500 carload* to Kansas City and 150 carloads to Omaha, and that during all this time the rate* on grain from most of these stations were less to Omaha than to Kan - sas City. It is readily seen from the evidence introduced by the complainant that its petition is founded almost entirely on the matter of discrimina - tion as between the two markets of Kansas City and Omaha. As Kansas ■ not located in Nebraska, it would appear that this question of dis - crimination should more properly have been brought to the attention of the Interstate Commerce &lt; 'ommisaion, rather than before this Commission, because if, after a thorough investigation of all the facts, it should appear, in order that justice might be done, that the rates to Kansas City should be advanced, this Commission would be powerless to bring about the desired result in order that the discrimination as between the two markets, might be made to disappear. This is especially true as to the rates on corn from the Nebraska stations named, when shipmenU are destined to consuming markets in the south and southwest where the differential in favor of Kansas City is from 3 to 5 cents per hundredweight. This is a matter that would have to be taken into consideration in the final fixing of rates as be - tween the two markets, and is a question over which this Commission has no jurisdiction. It is urged by counsel for complainant that the rates on corn to Omaha should be based on the rate named by defendant Chicago, Bur - lington ft Quincy Railroad Company from its Nebraska stations to Kan - sas City, claiming that because this carrier makes a rate of 7.5 cents per hundredweight on corn from Wymore to Kansas City, a distance of 186 miles, this Commission should order it to establish a rate of 7~. cents per hundredweight on corn from Hardy to Omaha, a distance of 173 miles. The question of making rates on the basis of the distance hauled, is one that is before this Commission in the final determination of an action in which the class rates of this state are affected. While it is true that the length of haul should, in a large measure, represent the expense to the carrier for the service performed, yet. at the same time, the Commission does not feel called upon at present to say that the distance hauled shall be the predominating factor in arriving at what a reasonable rate shall be. In view of these facts, it is clear to the Commission that it should not be asked to lower the rates complained of to Omaha, in order to remove the alleged discrimination as between the grain markets located at Omaha and Kansas City. Complainant in its petition charges that the rates on corn from the several stations named, to Omaha, are excessive and unreasonable. Very </seg>
            <seg id="p195">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 191 little evidence, however, was introduced at the hearing tending to establish this contention, with the possible exception of the distance hauled In the final disposition of this case, it appears to the Commission that the main question to be determined is what is a reasonable rate on corn from the several stations to Omaha, after taking into consideration all of the conditions under which this commodity is handled in the ter - ritory affected. By reference to a map of Nebraska, it is readily seen that most of the station* mentioned in the complaint are peculiarly situ - ated, in that they are close to a Missouri river crossing. Via the Chicago, Burlington ft Quincy railroad, the distance from Wymore, Nebraska, to Rulo, Nebraska, is seventy-nine miles. While it is true that Rulo is not used as a basing point for the nam - ing of proportional rates to eastern markets, the Commission recognizes the fact that this is simply because a primary market has not been established at that point. With this exception, however, it is located similarly to other points on the Missouri river from which proportional rates are named, and the Commission feels justified in considering the territory complained of as entitled to a rate to a Missouri river crossing from which proportional rates are maintained by the carrier, in compe - tition with other stations located approximately the same distance from ■uch proportional rate-basing points. If the carriers prefer to name rates to some particular Missouri river crossings for the purpose of accumulating grain traffic, or for other reasons, the territory located adjacent to the Missouri river should have the advantages of its location, even though the nearby point is not used as a proportional basing station and the rates should be ad - justed on the basis of the closer crossing point. In consideration of this principle and other matters equally as im - portant, but not mentioned here, we are of the opinion that the rates on corn from the stations hereafter named to Omaha should be reduced.

IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Com - mission that the Chicago, Burlington ft Quincy Railroad Company amend its grain tariffs in sued manner as to provide the following rates, in cents per one hundred 1 100) pounds, on corn, grain and grain products taking the same rates as corn, from the stations named, on its line of railroad, to Omaha, South Omaha and Nebraska City, Nebraska: irmour 7.2 •iberty ;inney 7.3 rymore 7 4 :rider 7.5 idell 7.5 anham 7.5 [ ar dy 11.

February 2:i. l'.tln, the complainant being represented by Bernard eny, and defendant by W. A. Dilworth. KThe evidence introduced by complainant, and not contradicted by de - ant, was that the distance between Hastings and Red Cloud Is about ••-one miles; that the passenger service consisted of one mixed train </seg>
            <seg id="p198">194 THIRD ANNUAL REPORT in each direction, carrying freight and passengers, as well as distributing material for repairs and construction along the line. Some of the in - dustries located on the road, such as sand pits, ice houses, etc., con - sume much time in switching by the crew, delaying the trains to such an extent as to make the service almost unendurable to passengers. The scheduled time of this train is between four and five hours from Hastings to Red Cloud, and coming north it is two hours and ten minutes from Ayr to Hastings, a distance of twelve miles. The testimony was volumi - nous and undisputed by evidence that for the past seventeen years the passenger service along this line had been inadequate, and that the patience of the patrons of the road bad become exhausted. At this hearing it was the unanimous opinion of all witnesses for complainant living at Blue Hill, and south of there to Red Cloud, that the greater number of patrons would be best served by having a train leave Hastings in the morning, returning from Red Cloud in the evening, thus giving those living along the line in Webster county an opportun visit their county seat and return the same day. Others living north of Blue Hill and in Adams county contended for a train from the south In the morning, their county seat being at Hastings. It was understood by all parties at the close of this bearing that defendant should have two weeks after the receipt of transcript of testi - mony adduced at the hearing to satisfy the complaint, and that upon failure to do so the Commission would issue an order in the case. On March 16, 1910, formal complaint No. 98 was filed by Carson Hi Id ret h, accompanied by a i -ned by about 200 alleged patrons of the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company. This complaint involved not only that portion of the defendant's line between Hastings and Red Cloud, but took into consideration some seventeen- other towns west of Red Cloud, as well as the general public desiring to use m between Oxford and Red Cloud in connection with the scheduled trains north and east. The defendant company proposed and installed, about April 3rd. ad - ditional service between Oxford and Hastings, via Red Cloud, the abject being to satisfy both complaints and at the same time relieve certain con - gested conditions existing between Oxford and Red Cloud, which condi - tions prevented the maintenance of train schedules between said towns. This added train was scheduled to leave Oxford in the morning, run to Hastings, and return to Oxford in the evening. Objection was made to this added service by those favoring Mr. Good's complaint, on account of the alleged fact that it gave no relief in reaching Red Cloud from the north and returning the same day, as well as affording no relief in the delivery of mail at stations between Hastings and Red Cloud. On April 27, 1910, Wm. A. Cole of Bloomington, filed a petition of intervention, protesting against the service between Oxford and Hastings, whereupon the commission, in order to consider all complaints together, and in order to secure a broader view of the whole situation, fixed the </seg>
            <seg id="p199">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 195 18th day of May, at Red Cloud, as the time and place for further hearing. At this hearing all members of the Commission were present. Mr. Good and Mr. Cole were represented by Bernard McNeny; Mr. Hildreth was not represented, except by Mr. Tibbets, who appeared for the Commercial Club of Hastings. Mr. Dilworth represented defendant. The evidence submitted by Mr. Good and his petitioners was similar in character to that given at the Hastings hearing. Most of the wit - nesses admitted, however, that the service afforded by the added train &gt;en Oxford and Hastings was an improvement over what they formerly had, so far as passenger service was concerned, but stated that there had been no improvement in the mail service, and as to Cowles the service was inferior to that previously given. So far as getting to and from the county seat, the added service had given do relief, the situation being that in order to transact business at Red Cloud it was necessary to go there in a private conveyance or go by rail and remain over night. The testimony of Mr. Cole and others who transact business at Bloomington, the county seat of Franklin county, was similar in character, and they were insistent in their de - mands for county seat service to Bloomington. The contention of the railroad company, while admitting that the -ly given on the line between Hastings and Red Cloud was at passenger trains cannot be maintained on the theory of county seat service. Two county seats on a branch line require service • directions, and with one train each way per day, satis - factory seivice to both is impossible. stress was placed on results of the service already installed. The new train leaves Hastings at 4:00 o'clock p. m. after the arrival of from Chicago, Omaha and Lincoln, thus delivering passengers and mail the same evening between Hastings and Oxford; passengers from the north and west, Aurora and beyond, are also accommodated. It was promised at this hearing that after May 29th, No. 8, leaving Oxford at 5:30 o'clock in the morning for Hastings, via Red Cloud, would connect with No. 9, the fast mail from the east, and deliver mail destined to all points between Oxford and Cowles at an earlier hour than had previously been possible. According to schedules on file in this office, No. 8 makes connection with No. 13 from St Louis, Kansas City and St. Joseph, at Red Cloud, giving immediate service for passengers and mail to points north. No. 8 also makes close connection at Hastings with No. 2 east, as well a* to points north, via Aurora. ■ ommodations for reaching and returning from county seats the same day is a matter that has been very perplexing to the Commission, and one it has very frequently been called upon to adjust. The diffi - culties encountered, except in cases where county seats are located in arge business centers, should be apparent to the most casual observer when it is remembered that such service must be provided for by local rains, interstate trains not being under the jurisdiction of state authori- </seg>

ThU case is no exception to the rule, and while viewing con - ditions in the territory concerned from tbe standpoint of those desiring county seat service, we feel it tu be a duty which we owe to the general traveling public to take a broader view of existing needs. That the new service is proving of great value to the general traveling public, as well as materially improving transportation conditions between Hastings and Oxford, was demonstrated during the month immediately prior to the last bearing, at which it was shown that No. 7. westbound, handled passengers, an average of 139 per trip, and in the opposite direction No. 8 handled 2,456. being an average of 102 per trip.

From the evidence it appears that Holdrege is the county seat of Phelps county; that it has a population of 3,500 to 4,000 inhabitants; that it i» the western terminus of the Holdrege and Nebraska City branch of the defendant company's lines, a line some 245 miles in length, and the eastern terminus of the Holdrege and Sterling branch of the de - fendant's lines, a line 230 miles in length, commonly known as the 'High Lane; " that it is a division point on the main line of the defendant, running from Denver to Omaha and Chicago; that there are four passen - ger trains each way daily on the main line that stop at Holdrege, and one passenger train each way daily, except Sunday, on the "High Line" and braska City line, making a total of twelve passenger trains in and out of the Holdrege depot daily, except Sunday. It further appeared from the evidence that the assessed valuation of property in tbe city of Holdrege increased from $223,335.00 in 1907 to k imi in 1909; that the postoffice receipts increased from $6,349.73 in 24 in 1909; that the county has voted bonds in the sum )f $1 tor the erection of a court house in said city of Holdrege; that the national government has appropriated $8 for the erection of a postofflce building; that some .&gt;00 new residences had been erected within the past four years; that large and substantal business buildings are in progress of construction or in contemplation and ready for construction, and that the revenue of the defendant company derived rom business originating and destinating at Holdrege for the year be - ginning July 1. 1908. and ending June 30, 1909, aggregates $270,537.15, of which amount $93,396.43 was from ticket sales. </seg>
            <seg id="p202">198 THIKO ANNUAL* WIT PORT An «T«wlwlioD of the station reports of the railroad companies operating in this state, Including the defendant, for that period, filed with this Commission, discloses the fact that the amount received from ticket sales at Holdrege is only exceeded at four of the defendant's stations, i. e. : Omaha, Lincoln, Hastings and Alliance; and if ticket sales of all roads are included as at junction points, is only ex - ceaded at ten stations. From the evidence and a personal inspection, it appears that .the present depot grounds consist of a strip of ground 150 feet in width, lying north of the main line track of defendant and between East avenue and West avenue, the two main streets of Holdrege running north and south; that the present depot, a frame structure 28x82. built many years ago for an eating house and subsequently converted into a depot, lies close to the east line of West avenue, if extended, leaving an un - occupied space between the east side of said depot and East avenue approximately 200 feet in length by 150 feet in width; that th. only one waiting room 28xu6, containing a lunch counter occupying a space 8x20, said waiting room having seating arrangements for forty - four persons; that there are no toilet facilities afforded except a frame outbuilding divided into two compartments, located some forty-five feet north of the depot, which is more or less unsanitary and often difficult of access by reason of the "High Line" train, which stands on a track eleven feet to the north of the depot from the time of its an o'clock p. m.) to the time of its depart o'clock a. in. i ; that the approach to the toilet from the depot consists only of a poor cinder walk; that the passenger platform along the main line tracks consists of a brick walk sixteen feet wide; that the approach to the depot, » : located south of the main line track about fifty-five feet of a brick walk sixteen feet in width, separating two fenced-in areas con - sisting of lawn and trees, each approximately 37x42; that frequent said platform and approach are so crowded (and particularly when ub - siructed by baggage and express trucks) that it is difficult for p. to board their trains, and frequently passengers have to climb fencts and cross the lawn in order to get around the trucks and onto tueir trains; that the approach to the depot from West avenue is ■ the "High Line" track, through a narrow bricked passage way located between the depot on the east and the express building and coal shed on the west, to the platform paralleling the main track, and thence via the approach located between the fenced areas; that this approach from Wast avenue is often blocked with express and baggage trucks, and also by the "High Line" train. The evidence further showed that the waiting room is heated by a coal stove; that cigars are sold there and that smoking is the rule rather than the exception; that the waiting room is often crowded so that women and children are required to stand or go outside; that when so crowded, and particularly in inclement weather, it is "unhealthy for </seg>
            <seg id="p203">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 199 the number of people who have to be there," and that people go outside to avoid the smoke and bad air. That the crowded condition of this depot is the rule and not the ex - ception, is evidenced by the testimony of the defendant's agent, who testified that he sold, on the average, 200 tickets daily, and sometimes on special occasions 800; that this would not include patrons using mileage books or coupon passengers (i. e., through passengers from points on the "High Line" to points beyond Holdrege on the other branches), who would number from thirty to seventy, and the coupon passengers from the Nebraska City branch, who would number from ten to fifteen. It is also evidenced by a compilation of a count made by a citizen of Hold - rege, who counted the number of people found upon the depot premises r ten minutes prior to the departure of trains, for a period of eighteen days between January 10, 1910, and January 29, 1910, which in - cluded several days of bad weather. This count did not include many people hurrying to the trains between the time of making the count and the departure of trains. From this compilation it appears on seventeen days during the period named, prior to the departure of No. 2 eastbound on the main line, and 1 on the "High Line," the lowest number counted was sixty-eight and the highest number 202, with an average of 125.4; and likewise for a period of sixteen days, prior to the departure of No. 10 eastbound on the main line at 7:40 o'clock p. m., and the arrival of No. 97 on the Nebraska City branch at 7:30 o'clock p. m., the lowest number counted was twenty-one and the highest number ninety-four, with an average for that period of sixty-two. M witness testified that on one occasion there was a person in each seat of the waiting room, except one where a man was reclining, occupying three or four seats, and twenty-two people were standing. t'endant's station agent, who had been in charge of the Holdrege station for sixteen years, when asked as to what, in his judgment, mak - ing a reasonable allowance for the normal growth of Holdrege and terri - tory tributary that uses Holdrege as a junction point, would be a fair seating capacity to afford seating facilities to the patrons of defendant under normal conditions, answered from 100 to 125. The improvements tentatively adopted by the defendant consisted of lowering the depot, rearrangement of the ground floor of present depot, whereby the present baggage room would be converted into a men's waiting room, and the present waiting room devoted exclusively to women. Modern toilet facilities were to be afforded. The baggage and lunch rooms were to be removed to a new frame building, the location of which had not been determined upon. These improvements would involve an expense of not less than $5,000.00. These proposed changes, while decidedly an improvement over present conditions, do not, in the opinion of the Commission, meet the full requirements of the situation. The fences in front of the present station should be removed; the approach from Wegt avenue between </seg>

If so much can be said under the circumstances above quoted, how much stronger are the facts presented in the case at bar. The passenger receipts are over three times as great, and besides it is a junction point of considerable magnitude, large numbers of passengers changing trains daily, whose comfort and convenience should be as much, if not more, of an object to the defendant as the comfort and convenience of the citi- zens of Holdrege. Irrespective of the splendid financial condition of the defendant, the cost of an entire new station, fit and appropriate to the place, is not so much in excess of the cost of the proposed improvements as to merit usideration.

Council Bluffs, Topeka, Kansas City and St. Joseph. Complainants refus. in this offer. From the evidence it appeared that the value of candy F. O. B. factory ranged &gt; t~ a pound to 50 cents a pound; that the average value would not exceed 26 cents per pound, and in the case of one large shipper that the average selling price of the output was 12&lt;4 to 15 cents a pound. One large shipper testified that of the entire shipments made by his firm, aggrt-. .'99 pounds during a representative week. ] pounds was of a value of 15 cents per pound and under and 8,433 pounds of a value of over 15 cents per pound. Another large shipper testified that on shipments aggregating 64, - 509 pounds during three representative weeks, 50,612 pounds was valued pound and under, or about 79 per cent., and 13,897 pounds, or about 21 per cent, at over 15 cents per pound. These candies are ordinarily packed in pails, cases or boxes, and, as general rule, particularly among the candy manufacturers, candies of the higher and lower values, for the sake of convenience and saving in cost of packing, are mixed in one shipment, resulting in the entire ship - ment taking the higher rating. The saving in expense and the con - venience of such a practice inure to the benefit of the manufacturer and shipper, at the expense of the purchaser, who buys his candies F. O. B. point of origin and consequently pays the higher freight charges where candies taking a higher valuation are packed in the same case with those taking a lower valuation. That it is practical to separate shipments taking different rates was evidenced by the practice of a large, wholesale grocery jobbing house which handled candy. 'iuplainants insisted, however, and the evidence showed, that the practice of placing a valuation on merchandise and basing the rate there - on was limited and exceptional; that out of possibly 10,000 articles in the classification, there were but twenty-one with a limited valuation clause, and that there was no other article of food or ordinary com - merce similar to candy upon which the limitation was placed. The evidence further showed that there were many articles of com - merce, such ae Plug tobacco, valued at .'7 to I und. Baking pom to 40 cents per pound. Candles, valued at rents per pound. Dried fruit, valued at 10 to 30 cents per pound. and numerous others, which take third class irrespective of value. Complainants also cited examples of various commodities taking fourth class rates which would appear to be analogous to candy, when considering the elements which enter into the rating of any given article. </seg>
            <seg id="p210">206 THIRD ANNUAL REPORT to-wit: value, risk (from the transportation standpoint) and the density as represented by bulk and weight. The defendants contended that candy is more or less of a luxury; that so far as possible there should be uniformity in classification or ratings; that while the present classification is not to be held as a thing ■acred, it should not be departed from except for argent and cogent reasons; that if each state, through its commission or legislature, were to rate or classify each article according to its own notion, it would produce a situation not only unsatisfactory to the railroads, but to the shipper*. This Commission fully realizes the desirability of a uniform classi - fication when possible, and the difficulty of determining whether any particular commodity is bearing more than its fair share of the cost of transportation. The Railroad Commission of Iowa has had this same ion under consideration and has determined that candy and con - nery should be rated at third class, when the average n value does not exceed la cents per pound. After careful consideration of the evidence and the questions sub - mitted, we concur in the classification established by the Iowa Commis - sion and find that confectionery, in barrels, pails, cases or drums, in tin pails, crated, galvanized steel bushel measures with tight wooden covers, galvanized iron pails or in glass boxed, in less than carload shipments, when the average invoice value does not exceed 15 cents per pound, and is so receipted for. should be rated third class; where the average invoice value exceeds 15 cents per pound or value is not stated, should be rated as first class ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the defendants herein, to-wit : Chicago &amp; North- Western Railway Company.

A hearing was held at Albion, due notice having been given, at which •eYidence was taken and the remonstrators, a committee appointed by the Commercial Club of Albion, were heard. Applicant's system was installed some time in 1899, at which time some $3,000.00 was invested in the property. At that time its subscribers numbered seventy -one (71), its service was grounded circuit, and the rates charged the same as now. At present the exchange, which is being converted into an up-to date metallic service, has two hundred seventy-seven (277) residence sixty-seven (67) business and two hundred eighty-five (285) farm sub scribers, or a total of six hundred twenty-seven (627) The amount of stock issued is thirty thousand dollars ($30, &lt;" and it is Insisted by its officers, Messrs.

The Commission has caused a careful ex - amination and analysis of applicant's books to be made, and finds that for the years 1900 to 1909, inclusive, the applicant has paid out the following amounts Wages 114 Sundries 8.208.56 Real estate and buildings. 4 Material Officers' and managers' salaries 17.666.33 Receipts from sundries ... . 1,593.02 The books do not show, except for an item of $2,000.00 in 1904. any credits to capital account by reason of sale of stock.

No dividends have been declared on the stock, all surplus earnings having been put back into extensions or included in the item of "Officers' salaries," aggregating f r an average of $1,766.63 per year for the ten years. By reason of the failure of the applicant to so keep its accounts as to show how much of its material and wage expenditures were properly chargeable to plant investment and depreciation accounts, as distin - guished from maintenance and operating accounts, it is impossible to make any finding, from an examination of the books, as to the amount of money Invested in the plant. A physical valuation of applicant's plant by competent engineers will alone satisfactorily determine the value of its property. Applicant's officers state that the improvements now under way and the cost of changing from a grounded circuit service to the improved metallic service, involves an additional expense of about $10,000.00. While the Commission cannot make a specific finding as to the value of applicant's property devoted to the public service, until such time as a physical valuation is made, it is proper to state that, in the opinion of the Commission, an exchange system of the size and character of the applicant's cannot be constructed at a cost much less than fifty dollars ($50.00) per telephone. If the Commission is correct in this opinion (and it is baaed on the testimony of many witnesses, and conferences had with the operators of telephone companies in cases of a character similar to this), the contention of applicant that its property is worth thirty thousand dollars ($30,000.00), is not far wrong. An examination of the balance sheets shown in the annual report* of applicant for the years 1907-8 and 1908-9, discloses the following: Applicant insists that it did not earn sufficient to set aside a reason - able amount for depreciation, after paying a fair dividend on the value of it-s property. This contention could be raised with greater force if applicant had kept its books so that an examination of same would dis - close what expenditures were properly chargeable to maintenance and operation and what were properly chargeable to replacement or depreciation. There is no doubt in the minds of the Commissioners that more or less of the above amounts charged to the maintenance and [aintenance $1,725.00 eneral expense 2,764.04 perating expense 2,765.00 «preciation ... none roflt 1,085.00 arnings $8,319.04 $2,373.65 2.473.11 2.599.13 none 2,504.99 Total $8,319.04 $8,319.04 $9,940.88 $9,940. </seg>

In the Matter of the Application of Douglas County Telephone Company of Va itska. for Authority to Change Itg Rates for Tele- phone Service at Valley, Klkhorn and Waterloo. W H. ( OWGILL. Commissioner This application for authority to increase th«&gt; rate for all telephone service came on to be heard at Valley. Nebraska, in the opera house, February 15, 1910. Kobinson, president of the company, appeared for the applicant, and A. R. Oobson si "' appeared for the remonstrators. The petitioner in the above entitled proceeding is a public utility engaged in furnishing telephone service in the villages of Valley, Water- loo and Elkhorn. On January 1. 1910, it had in effect the following schedule of rate* Individual or party line business, 3 exchanges $1.50 Individual residence line, 3 exchanges 1.00 Farm line service, 1 exchange 1.00 Farm line service, 3 exchanges 1.25 Toll from Valley to Waterloo or Elkhorn .10 cent, per month discount on farm lines if paid six months In advance. Petitioner alleges that the cost of construction and operation is in- creasing each year; that the plant is growing old and that no depre- ciation has ever been charged against the plant for the purpose of re- placement. The authority of the Commission is therefore asked for the promulgation of the following schedule of rates: Individual or party line business, 1 exchange 11.75 Individual residence line, 1 exchange 1.25 Party line residence. 1 exchange . 1.00 Farm line service. 1 exchange 1.25 It appears from the testimony of the president of the company that ,ii. -s in Valley, Waterloo and Elkhorn, and in the territory adjacent to these three villages. Valley has a population of from 600 to TOO, Waterloo 300 to 400, and Elkhorn 300 to 400. The distance from Valley to Waterloo is three and one-half miles; from Waterloo to Elkhorn, about three miles; from Valley r Elkhorn, on a direct line, about six and one-half miles. The company started operations about 1900, with a small switchboard at Valley. At the present time the switchboard in the village of Valley has a capacity and now has in use 231 telephones; at Waterloo a switch- board which has now in use 78 telephones, and at Elkhorn a switchboard which has now in use 117 telephones. The entire system is on a metallic basis, except the rural lines. At the end of the year 1909, the company had the following number of subscribers </seg>

The evidence of the remonstrators is to the effect that a portion of the labor on the farm lines was performed by the farmers along the lines of tke company, and no money was paid for said labor, nor was there any account kept as to what amount of labor was performed In 1909 the company paid a 5 per cent, dividend on ndinft stock, and at various times during the life of this exchange, dividends have been declared Unfortunately the only financial reports of the company which are available at the present time, are for the fiscal years ending June 30 1908 and 1909 EARNINGS For year ending June 30, MM $6,036.75 EXPEN8B8 Operating and current repairs ..$3,6*9.00 Taxes *6 4- Dividend, 5% on capital stock issued (120.000 .00) 1,000.00 $4,735.43 Leaving balance for new construction or depreci ation during this period 1,301.32 $«,036.75 New construction during this period $2,251.99 1,301.32 EARNINGS For year ending June 30, 1909 ._ $6,269.15 EXPENSES Operating and current repairs and expenses $4,218.44 Dividend, 6% on outstanding stock ($20,000.00) 1,000.00 Leaving balance for new construction or depreci - ation during this period 1,050.00 $6,269.15 </seg>

The petitioner filed an application asking permission to modify its tariff of rates filed with the Commission so as to authorize the collection of the following charges for switching service: 1. For live stock received from or delivered to connecting lines. • 2. For cars loaded with cinders or rubbish and cars loaded for Omaha proper. $2.00 per car. For grain and other commodities from connecting lines delivered to the I'pdike elevator, $2.00 per car.

While some of them appeared by their representatives at the hearing, they gave no </seg>
            <seg id="p222">218 THIRD ANNUAL REPORT testimony and made no protest other than such as was contained in their answer*. The Updike Elevator Company appeared and protested against any charge for setting grain from the transfer switch to their elevator, con - tending that the existing charge of $2.00 per car for hauling grain out should cover the inward movement. An attempt was made by the intro - duction of evidence to show that this charge of $2.00 per car, when com - pared with live stock at $1.00 per car, would be discriminatory. It was clearly shown, and admitted, that live stock was given preference on account of being a more perishable commodity, but, on the other hand, the evidence seemed to be clear that one engine could, in a given time, handle a much larger number of cars of live stock than of any other commodity, on account of their being "bunched" and easier to unload. The applicant contends that in the performance of this swil service it is the servant of the carriers with which it maintains nections; that, in fact, it furnish.-- the terminal facilities of such carriers, and that it is the practice, as well as the duty, of such carriers under the law, to absorb all switching charges. The following questions are presented to the Commission in this case, in the consideration of which a voluminous amount of testimony was taken and careful investigations made by members of the Commis - sion and their expert engineers and accountants: 1. Is the app to make the proposed changes in its rates, and are such proposed changes reasonable? lication is granted, upon whom shall the burden of paying the increased rates fall? 3. What is a fair and reasonable value of the property used in the performance of service covered by these rates? 4. What is a proper division of earnings and expenses bet*. parent company and hing departm. 5. Is the switching department of the Union 8t ipany acting as a terminal for the various railroads, or is it i iming the functions of an industrial railroad, in conneeti&gt; he several industries located on its tracks, in addition to the terminal service which the railroads are obligated to perform? It is the opinion of the Commission that the proposed rates are no excessive. As to who shall bear them, we feel inclined to adopt, for th purposes of this case, the construction placed by the applicant upon th relationship existing between its switching department and the carrier connecting therewith, to- wit: That it is a common terminal of th several railroads with which connections are maintained. This theor is supported by the fact that it has been the practice of the variou carriers to absorb all switching charges, their published tariffs coverin all expense of transportation from point of origin to final delivery a industries located on tracks of applicant. The evidence submitted as to the value of the property was con - flicting, that found by the applicant being $2,591,390.00, while the experts employed by the Commission reported it to be $1,725. 719. On. The prin - cipal difference was in the real estate, the value found by the applicant </seg>
            <seg id="p223">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 219 being $1,27 and that of the Commissions experts 1671,498.00. It is clear that the increase* asked for by the applicant will not take care of depreciation and pay a fair return on either of the values placed upon the property at the hearing. By reason of the foregoing, and for the further reason that the Commission is at present engaged in the valuation of the various rail - road properties in the state, including the terminals in South Omaha and Omaha adjacent to applicant's property, it is deemed proper to defer the fixing of a value on applicant's property until such time as the Commission shall have received and considered all evidence that may be offered regarding the values of the adjoining railroad properties. A imrt. at least, of the expenses assigned to the switching depart - ment was an arbitrary apportionment made by the applicant. The Com - mission has no information as to the earnings or expenses of the Union ' .mpiiiiy. and so far as an adjustment of this case is 0— ciTBiid. it is deemed unnecessary at the present time to make any finding as to the proper division of expenses between the Union Stock Yards Company proper and the switching department. As to the fifth question, it is the understanding of the Commission that there are now pending in the courts certain suits, brought by some of the railroads of which the applicant claims to be the terminal, for the recovery of demurrage charges. The Commission therefore hopes, by the adjudication of these cases, to obtain information that will assist it in a final decision of this point. The Commission has had occasion, in the consideration of a previous matter (application No. 38), to discuss the general conditions connected with the switching service performed by the Union Stock Yards Com - pany, and deems a repetition in this case unnecessary. This opinion and order are promulgated without any attempt to provide proper earnings to cover depreciation and dividends on values shown by the testimony with reference to the facilities furnished and used by the applicant in its railway operations, but the applicant's petition is granted on the general proposition of the reasonableness of the charge for the service performed. There is a question in the minds of the Commissioners as to whether there should not accrue to the switching department other revenue for services performed by it as an industrial railway. The Commission finds that $1.00 per car for switching live stock, per car for cars loaded with cinders and rubbish and cars loaded for Omaha proper, $2.00 per car for cars of grain and other commodities handled between connecting lines and the Updike elevator, $2.00 per car for empty cars ordered and placed for loading but not used, and $5.00 per car (or locomotive) for locomotives and passenger equipment de - livered direct from one connecting line to another, or received from or delivered to a connecting line, are reasonable rates within themselves for the service performed, and are in line with rates for similar service* </seg>

After a careful investigation, we are of the opinion that the schedule of rates applied for is not excessive, particularly the rates for farm service. Careful and painstaking investigations made by the Wisconsin Commission have determined that the cost of construction and main- tenance of the average farm line (party line) telephone exceeds the cost of the average town residence telephone, and in some cases has justified a farm line rate of $1.50 per month as against a town residence rate of $1.00 per month.

Remonstrances having been filed, a hearing was held in the dis - ■ourt room at Rush vi lie on March 23, 1910, at which tome fifteen or more farm lines were represented. Eroni the evidence it appears that applicant's exchange, which is a d circuit, serves some thirty-two business and forty-five residence ribers in Kushville: that all of said business subscribers are on dual lines except three: that of the residence subscribers all are 'o-party lines except twelve individual, and one three-party line.

The manager and owner, D. W. Ferree, was receiving $70.00 per prior to his assuming the management of the applicant corn - pay. Previous to the filing of the application herein, Mr. Ferree and his wife operated the switchboard. For some considerable time there had been general dissatisfaction with the switchboard service. Subsequent to the filing of thn application, a central operator was employed at a salary of I month and board. Since the employment of the operator, who is relieved by the manager and his wife, the service has been much better, if not completely satisfactory. Ilt appears from the manager's testimony that a portion of the pense of $304.35 for supplies and materials were properly chargeable new construction or depreciation, but it is impossible to say Just how much. Applicant insists that 15 per cent, is a proper charge for depre - ciation: that the plant will need to be rebuilt within the course of the next five years.

For example, if you would give us the numbers and initials of any cars which had been set to repair tracks in order to conceal evidence of leakage, or which had been otherwise unduly delayed in transit, together with date* of shipment, points of origin, names of consignors, etc., we could call upon the railroad company for a statement showing the movement of such cars, and this information, when received, would, of course, be a matter of public record in our office, accessible to all persons desiring to avail themselves of same.

Sir: — would respectfully- ask that you lay before the members of your mniission the following proposition which suggests itself to me, to-wit: First. I feel that it would be of incalculable benefit if members of the different state Commissions throughout the Union would meet as often as possible and exchange ideas with reference to their work, and in this way come in closer touch. k Second. It is almost imperative that the Commissions throughout e Union visit Washington several times a year to appear before the terstate Commerce Commission and to look after other interests of their respective states, etc Under the present law, state Commissioners are not allowed to use ree transportation outside of their state, nor are the railroad companies permitted to issue such transportation involving an interstate trip. In many of ti the salaries of the Commissioners and the allowance or expenses is so small that the Commissioners are not financially able to attend meetings of the state Railroad Commissioners nor are they able to go to Washington as often as it is necessary on account of these onditions. The Railroad Commissioners of the various states are offl - lals employed by their state to work for the best interests of the people as well as the transportation companies, and in the discharge of these great duties I feel that the Commissioners of the respective states should be exempted from the law with reference to interstate transportation and </seg>
            <seg id="p244">240 THIRD ANNUAL REPORT be allowed to use free transportation to any point in the I'nion, and r dally to the city of Washington while engaged in official business their state. I would therefore respectfully suggest that you take this matter up with your state delegation tn congress and also with the Interstate Com - merce Commission and have the law so amended as to exempt state Com - missioners sad other official employes from such restrictions while in the discharge of their official duties.

I have laid this matter before the members of our Commission, as re - assted, and I am directed by them to say in reply that they ate not in ympathy with the proposed amendment as outlined by you. In ti: - ace, the proposed amendment, as we understand it. would 1' rely to the discretion of the railroads as to whether free transportation bould be issued in such cases, and to that extent would place the Com - isstioners under a greater or less obligation for favors extended in that egard. The plan would not be so objectionable if it were made obliga - ry for the railroads to issue such transportation to all members of state and federal Commissions, but even in that form, the Nebraska Commie - oners could not favor it. They feel that any amendment of this feature the Interstate Commerce act, in the way of exemptions from its pro - sions, would be but an entering wedge for a return to the abuses which nnerlv prevailed. Furthermore, they feel that such a request from Mais representing state and federal authority could be made only at a sacrifice of dignity. They are firmly convinced that necessary ex - penses incurred by attendance upon conferences at distant points or upon ■— tsnsi before the Interstate Commerce Commission at Washington. should properly be paid from the public funds, and they are furthermore convinced that the citizenship of the country would greatly prefer this method to Unit proposed by you.

On one of our lines we have a farmer who has two telephones, and his family use one telephone and his son's family use the other Both are associated together in the two places. On account of this asso - ciation he believes that they should only pay switching fees on the one telephone and have the other telephone free. We contend tha. they should pay for both telephones, as we charge the rate for switching a subscriber, and where there are two distinct families and two tele - psuisus that are ten miles apart, that they should pay on each telephone.

There are two questions which I would like to have passed upon and I do not consider either one of them hypothetical: 1 If it is true that the storage rules did not apply at Croftoc prior to January 14th, can a charge for storage be made under any circumstances on a shipment before that date? 2.

First I ha* ,n point in which there was a car consigned to nibution papers did not arrive in the city for seven days after the arrival of the car. The first forty-eight hours after the car .1 here the weather was flue but after that we had two days that an just poured down and part of the next and it was impossible to unload the car owing to the weather. Under the old rule the rainy would not count for demurrage but a recent rule of the demurrage ii or the Interstate Commerce Commission they settled this matter in this way: That after the free time has expired (which is forty-eight hours) you must pay for the rainy weather and all; that it makes no difference then how much bad weather there has been; or in other words the forty-eig-ht hours of the first two days being good, they claim that is all we are entitled to. To me this does not look to be good law. Then again, we order a car to be set into load with glass which requires a derrick. The car is set to the derrick and we bring down our •hree wagon loads. They have a platform for automobiles at the same place adjacent to the derrick; they pull the car out and leave us standing there after it had been once set, and leave us stand - ng three hours with three teams and three extra men while they unload </seg>
            <seg id="p254">250 THIRD ANNUAL REPORT a car of automobiles at the platform, which was entirely for their own convenience. Have not the railroad company got to make this loss of time, in cases of this kind, good to us? As they charge us demurrage when we do not unload promptly and it is our fault, should not the boot tit the other foot? Then again, in loading leas than carload cars to be switched to dlf - ft houses, in which the tariff sheet claims that they will deliver of cost, to the party for whom goods are for, shipments 6,000 Is or over, free of cost to the owner. Is it proper to make up this pound? of various shipments from 100 pounds to 2.000 pounds, aa as the aggregate will amount to MM pounds, and switch the lot, regardless of the number of expense bills, free of cost.

It is a custom in our city to take goods that packages are in bad order, and understood that if anything is wrong with the contents of the packages that they will make a notation at consignee's place o business should anything be wrong. This is done for the reason tha they wish to avoid a great many claims that would naturally arise by making a notation on the expense bill before goods left their freigh house. This rule has always worked well until recently. They got into the habit of making the notation that this notation was made at consignee' warehouse and the claim department takes this stand: Notation being </seg>
            <seg id="p255">251 NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION made at the warehouse, it relieves them from the responsibility, owing to the fact that it was made at the warehouse, when in reality it is for their convenience and they request us to do so.

Chairman Lincoln, April 2, 1910 Honorable Board of Railway Commissioners Lincoln, Nebraska. Gentlemen: I desire to be informed what constitutes the distinction between residence and a business telephone. Would a telephone placed in a residence with a firm name in the directory be classed as a business telephone or as a residence telephone? your honorable Commission take jurisdiction of the matter of es appearing in the telephone directory? If a telephone in a residence, when indexed in the director}* under a business w«i, becomes a business telephone by reason of such index, then is it not a discrimination for the telephone companies to index the physicians' residence telephones under the title of "Dr." and refuse to indicate the business or profession of all others?

Referring particularly to that part of your letter which relates to the rate applicable to physicians whose names are prefixed by the title "Dr." in the directory: I am directed by the Commissioners to say that in their judgment the rate would be properly applicable in case the physician main- I another telephone in his office for which he pays the regular business rate, but that if he maintains only one telephone and that in the business rate would properly apply under such cir- cumst st, as stated in our letter to Mr. Boorman of the Phelps County Telephone Company, found in our second annual report, the Commission feels that, as a general proposition, the classification of such telephones should be left to the discretion of the company unless formally presented Very truly yours, CLARK PERKINS, Secretary Farnam, Neb., April 5, 1910.

            <seg id="p263">259 NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION Lincoln, May 13. 1910. A. Kroner * Co., Alexandria, Nebraska. Gentlemen : — Referring to your favor of the 12th inst., in regard to demurrage on lumber : We enclose herewith copy of the Banning demurrage act of 1909, and would particularly call your attenion to the following extract from section 1-i : provided further, that when by reason of delay or -■■» — - pnnttocu /wvkt. uuu wuto uy reuuu ui uv»»jr ui irregularities on the part of the railroad company in filling orders for cars, or in the transportation or delivery of freight, oars are bunched in excess of the capacity of the shipper to load as indicated in his appli - cation, or for the consignee to unload, such shipper or consignee shall have separate and distinct periods of free time in which to load or un - load as the case may be. the car or cars specified in each separate application, or in each bill of lading or waybill of different date. The same section allows thirty-six hours for loading or unloading cars of less than Hii.ooo pounds capacity and sixty hours for loading or unloading those of 60,000 pounds or more capacity. This law, ycu will understand, relates only to shipmentstmoving between points in Ne - braska. The Commission has made no rules on the subject of demurrage, as section 1-q of the act makes it superior to any rules or regulations which the Commission might prescribe. Interstate shipments, or ship - ments moved from points outside Nebraska to Alexandria, are subject to a different rule, which allows forty-eight hours' free time on all cars, regardless of size. The bunching provision of this code is as follows: "When a shipper or receiver enters into the following agreement, the charge for detention to cars, provided for by rule 7, on all cars held for loading or unloading by such shipper or receiver, shall be computed on the basis of the average time of detention to all such cars during each calendar month, such average detention to be computed as follows: "(a) A credit of one day will be allowed for each car released with - in the first twenty-four hours of free time. A debit of one day will be charged for each twenty-four hours or fraction thereof that a car is detained beyond the first forty-eight hours of free time. In no case shall more than one day's credit be allowed on any one car, and in no case shall more than seven days' credit be applied in cancellation of debits accruing on any one car. "(b) At the end of the calendar month the total number of days credited will be deducted from the total number of days debited, and 11.00 per day charged for the remainder. If the credits equal or exceed the debits, no charge will be made for the detention of the cars, and no payment will be made to shippers or receivers on account of such excess of credits, nor shall the credits in excess of the debits of any one month be considered in computing the average detention for another month."

She could have had a 'phone when our company was organised but could not be induced to take one, and if we take her on now we will have to take four or five others.

Ton can see the name of our telephone company. We have thirty - eight subscribers and thirty-four are stockholders and four are renting. The renters had the chance to buy their share but thought it would be more satisfactory to rent than to own a share in case they wanted to move away, or for any other reason they became dissatisfied, and we are formed into a company Just for accommodation and it did not make any dHai— lie whether they bought their share or not We have had at least two that after renting for a year they have bought their share and I believe that eventually more of them will.

Dear Sir: — We would appreciate it very much if you would give us a little nut - line in regard to claims against the North-Western Railroad Company The point at issue is this: The local market does not close until 3:00 o'clock, but in the hog division trading is very erratic and ofttimee the entire business of the day is confined to a space of thirty minutes. and anything arriving after that period is over, the buyers will not look at at all. and it must be carried over until the following day. This results in a big shrinkage and ofttimee a decline in the market. Had the stock been delivered early in the morning, as it should, it would have been Ospnrii of while the market was on.

Omaha-Lincoln Differential. Omaha, Neb., July 23, 1910. Nebraska State Railway Commission, Lincoln, Nebraska. Gentleman: — We find that there is a prevailing rate of about 4 cents per 100 pounds on all common Omaha and Lincoln points, in favor of Lincoln. For some time past, this has been a source of annoyance to us and we write to make inquiry as to whether or not this rate should, In your opinion, prevail. Has the Chicago ft North-Western Railway Company filed with your honorable body a reason, or do you know why it is that this rood discriminates against Omaha and in favor of Lincoln? The distance from Lincoln to Fremont is, we believe, some fifty-five miles. The distance from Omaha to Fremont is thirty-seven miles. This would make a difference of 18 miles in the length of haul and in our opinion, a violation of the long and short haul clause. We would be pleased to have your interpretation of this rate. As jobbers, we have met with the argument of Lincoln Jobbers that their rate is 4 cents below the Omaha rate, and we have often wondered why it was permitted or why the rate originally was established by the C. ft N. W. Railway Company and later met by the competitive lines in this territory. Is it not possible to have this matter looked up in some manner so that Omaha may have an opportunity .to be heard, so that there would be no discrimination of the rate? Not only does the distance from Lincoln to Nebraska common points on the C. ft N. W. railway exceed that from Omaha, but very frequently, and in most cases in fact, transfers of this freight have to be made at Fremont, as we understand it. We would be pleased to hear from you in regard to this as to the legality and as to the Justice of this rate. Yours truly, SNYDER-TRIMBLE CO. Lincoln, July 25, 1910.

Sir: — Referring to the Informal complaint made by you when in this office one day last week in regard to DeWltt Telephone Company making a straight charge of 25 cents per month against all members of your lines No*. 43, 44 and 47: We have investigated this matter at some length, and as we under - stand the situation now, the farm lines in question are switched at both Clatonia and Hallam, members living nearest Clatonia paying 25 cents to the DeWltt company, which operates the exchange at that point, and MM living nearest Hallam, 25 cents to the Hallam company, but all laving access to both exchangee. It furthermore appears that the pur - pose of the DeWltt company was to compel the members on the Hallam end to pay for the service they received at riatonia. the same as those ving on the Clatonia end. If this is correct, the Commission does wit elieve that you would have any just cause for complaint against the DeWitt company, as it has a rate of 25 cents for switching farm nes regularly died in this office, and there appears to be no question but that it was performing that switching service for all persons alike against whom it proposed to make the charge. It we are not correct in our understanding, we would be glad to have you set us right, but unless we hear from you to the contrary within a reasonable time, we will assume that we have stated the situation in accordance with the facts and will dismiss your complaint for lack of cause of action. Very truly yours, CLARK PERKINS. Secretary Clatonia. Neb., August 8, 1910 Nebraska State Railway Commission, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sirs: — by our letter of August 6th at hand.

This is what Mr. Dauben - diek is trying to do, to compel all members on linea 43, 44 and 47 to pay 16 cents each in C'latonia, and is switching lines 40 and 45 for part of the members paying 25 cents in Clatonia, and the others are paying 20 cents in Cortland, and all having access to both switches.

Mr. Walker replies, however, that his company is dis - criminated against by being required to pay 25 cents per month for each and every person on lines Nos. 43, 44 and 47, some of whom live near Hallam and pay the same rate to the Hallam company, while persons liv - ing near &lt; ortland and paying the Cortland company for switching service, receive free service from your company at Clatonia.

The report of the committee resulted favorable, and owing to the fol - lowing and various reasons the motion for declaring such dividend carried unanimously: Our company was organized in 1904, and for three years no div - idend or benefit to the stockholders was declared in any form, and the earnings of the company were reinvested in extending the lines. Since that time never more than 6 per cent, dividend has been declared, and owing to this fact and the strictest economy in operating, we have a little exchange which represents a cost to us of over $13,000.00, as our report shows, whereas we have a paid up capital stock issued amount - ing to only $4,300.00 The motion which stands upon our record reads: "That a stock dividend of 100 per cent be declared the stockholders of The Pairfield Telephone Company, and the same be charged to un - divided profits."

Dear Sir: — In reference to the delay penalty applying on live stock shipments in this state. Should a car of stock for South Omaha be shipped from Callaway, Nebraska, and reach Kearney, Nebraska (distance 65 miles), in four hours and remain at Kearney, say five hours before a train from the west picked up the car and took it to the next division sation (Grand Island), would fourteen miles per hour rate of speed govern from Callaway to Kearney or to Grand Island, and would the delay at Kearney of five hours, waiting for a through train on main line, or any other train, be considered as a part of the fourteen miles per hour running time? Or, would the time lost in waiting at Kearney for a train to take the car on to Grand Island be exempt from becoming a part of the total running time from initial point to destination? Again, should that same car reach Grand Island (42 miles), in three hours after it left Kearney and remain in Grand Island yards four hours waiting for train or motive power to take it on to South Omaha, would this four hour Grand Island yard delay be counted in as a part of the running time which the statute requires? If it is so counted, would that delay there be on fourteen or eighteen miles per hour basis? Certain shippers have contended that under the statute all delays at division stations or points are chargeable to the carriers as a part of any delay coming under the penalty fixed by our law, but the writer's interpretation of it is that a shipment could remain twenty-four hours or more at a division point in a case like I have just outlined and the carrier cannot be held liable under the penalty law for failure to run the car either fourteen or eighteen miles per hour. I believe the carrier might be held for shrinkage, failure to reach market, for holding stock in the car over twenty-four hours, etc., but the only points desired settled are whether delays mentioned at Kearney and Grand Island are to be counted as a part of the running time, and if so, are they </seg>

Mr. Magney asks the Commis - on for a ruling as to whether the shipment in question was subject to the Nebraska demurrage statute or whether it was of an Mm haracter, as claimed by Mr. Hancock. In order that we may be fully advised in the premises, will you kindly furnish us a complete statement covering all the facts in control •bowing the point of origin of shipment, original destination, etc. If it Is possible for you to furnish paid freight bill covering same, or a copy, twill be at material assistance to the Commission in reaching elusion.

Gentlemen: k Referring to previous correspondence beginning with a letter from office to the county attorney of Douglas county, and which he rred to your office. are attaching hereto the papers (copies) in our claim No. 0544, on Pacific claim No. 1657-238-3. If we remember correctly the con- </seg>
            <seg id="p287">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 283 tenu of the latter that the Union Pacific seat to us, and which we attached to our letter to Mr. Magney, it was to the following effect: The railroad claims that the reciprocal demurrage law passed by recent act at legislature does not apply on interstate business, but applies only on the business beginning and ending in Nebraska. Then, n order to bring this particular case within these limits, they say that this car of wheat constitutes an interstate shipment, although it started at Hordville. in Hamilton county, and was unloaded at the Maney mills in Omaha. The claim that this shipment is interstate business, and that the reciprocal demurrage law does not apply, is based on the fact that t is customary for the terminal elevators and mills in this city to avail themselves of the privilege known as the "cleaning in transit" or "mill - ng in transit" conditions named in the tariff. The mill unloads this grain and grinds it, and it is then loaded and sent out at a through rate, and the expense bill or freight receipt received by the party who pays he freight, is Bled with the railroad officials as evidence of payment of the stated amount of freight to apply on a through rate to some distant point, to be determined by them at the time of reshipment. Our position is that, so far as we are concerned, the transaction is completed, and settlement is made for both the wheat and the freight on the basis of the grain unloaded at the mill or elevator in Omaha, and that the movement up to that time is not interstate, and does not be- come interstate until the grain or flour is reshipped. metimes grain coming in from the west is sent for unloading to the m Council Bluffs, and if the basis of settlement is the un - oading weights, we concede that grain that thus crossed the river for unloading, becomes interstate, and if the law does not apply on interstate business, it would not apply on such cars as crossed the river to be unloaded The question now to be determined is whether the grain that is un - loaded in Omaha, and is likely to be reloaded and go out to distant points, is also interstate business within the meaning of the law, and also the question is to be determined whether the reciprocal demurrage act applies or does not apply to either of the cases whether the grain be unloaded in Omaha, or whether it be unloaded across the river. Yours very truly, BEAL- VINCENT GRAIN CO. By C. Vincent. P. S. The railroads have been persistently objecting to and refus - ng to pay items of interest like these included in these papers, and our contention is that inasmuch as we have advanced money on the bills of lading, and are compelled to pay Interest on the capital necessarily borrowed to carry these bills of lading while the cars are being neg - ligently held by the railroad, that this interest is as much a loss to us as stolen wheat would be a lose to the shipper, and we are, therefore, equally entitled to recovery. We will thank you for ruling on this point also </seg>

Dear Sir: — Answering your favor of the 5th inst., in which you submit the question as to whether there is any ruling of the Commission preventing a shareholder in two farm line companies connecting the lines of each company with a single telephone instrument so constructed that when it to connected with either line it is disconnected with the other line, each line ringing its own bell: tl have to say that the Commission has made no ruling prohibiting i a method of operation. Matters of this kind are more in the rol of the directors of the several companies. Our functions are to that there is no discrimination; that the service is adequate and the s reasonable. The only objection we can see to such a practice at, you cite, would be that the several farm lines might be operated on a different basis, to - wit: one farm line might use telephone instruments adapted to a certain current or condition, and the other farm line a different instrument. The requirement of uniformity on a given party line or exchange is a reasonable one and certainly within the power of the directors to If the telephone instruments are similar on each line, and you do not switch or connect one line with the other so that certain parties are favored while others are not, we see no valid objection to your using the one instrument on both lines. However, if the directors of sitter company insisted on your maintaining a separate instrument for each line, the Commission would not interfere. Very truly yours, HENRY T.

Our records show that the distance via Lane cut-off is 19.1 miles, which, according to the Commission's order of September 16, 1907, would make rate on a ten-gallon can 15 cents.

UK PER] Lincol; Nebraska State Railway Commission Lincoln, Nebraska. Gentlemen: — I am in receipt of your recent letter, directing my attention to sec - tion 4120, Cobbey's Annotated Statutes i it h provides as follows: "The articles of incorporation must fix the highest amount of in - debtedness or liability to which the corporation shall, at any one time. be subject, wbich must in no case exec rds of the capital stock." You request my opinion on the following questioa "Can a corporation, under this statute, be permitted to issue its bonds or create an indebtedness in excess of two-thirds of the amount of capital stock actually issued ?" Your inquiry involves the meaning of the term "capital stock," as used in this statute. In a large number of adjudicated cases relating to the subject of taxation, wherein this term has been judicially defined, it has been almost universally held to mean the "capital" or "assets" of the corporation. It will be observed, however, that this statute is found in the law governing the organization of corporations, and should be construed in that light. The purpose the legislature bad &gt;&lt;.. la. </seg>
            <seg id="p299">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 295 in the enactment of this provision was doubtless the protection of mem - bers of the public in their dealing with them, by restricting corporations in their right to contract indebtedness. It is a matter of common knowledge that a great many corporations are organized with an authorized capital stock far in excess of the issued r paid up capital stock. We must therefore determine, if possible, hether the term "capital stock" was to be taken to mean the capital of the corporation which might consist of its assets, tangible and intangible, U issued and paid up capital stock, or its authorized capital stock. Tie members of the public would not get that protection the legislature ntended to give, were corporations permitted to contract an indebtedness to the extent of two-thirds of their authorized capital stock. The author - xed, but unissued or unsubscribed, stock is not an asset of a corporation, and it would therefore be of no benefit to creditors of a corporation. As hereinbefore suggested, the courts, in considering the meaning of his term, in connection with the revenue laws, have quite uniformly eld that it means the entire capital or assets of the corporation, and have sed and construed the term "capital stock" as synonomous with the words "capital" or "assets." I do not think, however, that this is the meaninK of the term "capital stock" that should be given in the con - nection it is used in the statute above set out, but that as here used t has a more restricted meaning. It is the subscribed and issued apital stock of a corporation through which it receives its actual apital or assets, and this constitutes a trust fund for the security and the benefit of creditors. In Sum/er &gt;■. f/tton, 91 U. S. 60, it was held: "The capital stock of an incorporated company is a fund set apart or the payment of its debts. It is a substitute for the personal liability which subsists in private copartnerships. When debts are incurred, a ontract arises with the creditors that it shall not be withdrawn or pplied otherwise than upon their demand, until such demands are atisfled. The creditors have a lien upon it in equity. If diverted, they may follow it as far as it can be traced, and subject it to the payment f their claims, except as against holders who have taken it Ixma .fide for (valuable consideration and without notice. It is publicly pledged those who deal with the corporation, for their security. Unpaid stock as much a part of this pledge, and as much a part of the assets of l company, as the cash which has been paid in upon it. Creditors ve the same right to look to it as to anything else, and the same right insist upon its payment as upon the payment of any other debt due to l company." Viewing the term "capital stock" used in the statute under con - sideration in the sense that the act was intended for the protection of creditors or persons contracting with the corporation, it is reasonably certain that it was intended to mean, and does mean, the capital stock paid in or subscribed, and not the authorized capital stock. tin the case of Commonwealth r. Lehigk Avenue Railway Co. 129 Pa. at i, the Lehigh Avenue Railway Company, with an authorized capital of 000,000.00 was given power to borrow money not exceeding an amount </seg>
            <seg id="p300">296 equal to "one-half of the par value of the capital stock." Only 10 per cent, or $100,000.00 of it* capital was paid in when it resolved to issue its bonds for a loan of * or two and one-half times the amount of its paid in capita] stock. A bill in equity was died by the commonwealth to enjoin the issuance of these bonds as contravening section 3 of the act of May 7, 1887, and the court held that the words "par value of the capital stock," used in the incorporating act. were to be construed to mean capital stock paid up, and not authorized capital stock, and sustained the judgment of the lower court enjoining the issuance of bonds to an amount in excess of I5U.000.OU or one-half the paid up capital stock. The case of MM* «.

The authorized capital stock of the corporation was $l its paid in capital stock was $11,400,000.00 and the secretary of state had based his charges and exacted his fees on the basis of the authorized capital stock, rather than on the paid up capital stock. In construing the term "capital stock," as used in this statute, the court held it not to mean the authorized capital stock not subscribed, but the paid up capital stock.

We desire to know whether an association, unincorporated, such as a commercial club, can bring a complaint challenging the unreasonable- Ben of rates on commodities mentioned in the Aldrich act. Yours truly, HENRY T. CLARKE, Jt., Chairman Lincoln, Neb., February 8, 1910 Nebraska State Railway Commission, K Lincoln, Nebraska, tlemen: — I hare yours of the 4th instant, in which you ask, in substance, the following question : Has an unincorporated association, such as a commercial club, the right to make a complaint challenging the unreasonableness of cer - tain rates on commodities mentioned in the Aldrich act? So far as material to this question, section 2, chapter 95. Session Laws of 1907, commonly known as the Aldrich act, is as follows: "The State Railway Commission shall have the power to hear and determine whether or not the freight rate upon any article or articles in such schedule or classification of rates is either so high as to be unjust to shippers, or so low as to be unremii: r unjust to any common carrier affected thereby, and upon complaint, in writing, of any person or corporation affected thereby, particularly specifying the article or articles upon which such rates are either too high or too low and the facts in connection therewith, said Railway Commission shall set such cause for hearing and upon trial thereon and a full hearing after notice thereof, shall either raise or lower the rate herein fixed upon such article or articles to the end that the same shall be just and reasonable to all parties concerned." I have examined the original complaint tiled by the Omaha Com - mercial Club before your body, upon which your question is founded. I observe it contains the allegation that the Omaha Commercial Club is duly incorporated. If so, the only question to be determined in con - struing this section is whether or not such commercial club has an in - terest such as is affected by the rates in question, and this is true for the reason said section provides that any person or corporation may make complaint. The allegations of the complaint are to the effect that the Omaha Commercial Club is composed of a large number of persons, com - panies and corporations whose interests are directly affected by the rate* sought to be changed. A liberal construction of this section would, in my opinion, permit even an unincorporated association to make the complaint. I do not understand that the provisions of the Aldrich act were designed by the legislature to in any way restrict or modify any of the provisions of the Railway Commission act which prescribed the procedure to be followed In presenting matters to the Railway Commission. Paragraph a, section </seg>
            <seg id="p303">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 299 5, chapter 90, Session Laws of 1907, commonly known as the Railway Commission act. is as follows "When any railway company, common carrier, or any person in hi* own behalf, or in behalf of any class of persons similarly situated, or any firm, corporation or association or any mercantile, agricultural or manufacturing society, ur any body politic or municipal organization, hall make complaint to the Railway Commission that any rate or rates xed by said commission in said schedule, or in any subsequent revised r modified schedule, or rate charged or published by any railroad company, is unreasonably high or low, unjust or discriminating, the board of Railway Commissioners shall immediately fix a day for hearing Section 10 of said act also provides as follows Any person, Arm, corporation or association, or any mercantile, agricultural, or manufacturing society, or any body politic or municipal rganization. complaining of anything done or omitted to be done by any railway company or common carrier, subject to the provisions of this i any of the laws of this state, relative to the control and regula - -i railway companies or common carriers under which said Commis - ias authority to act, may apply to said Commission by petition, riefly stating the fact, except as to the fixing, establishing and regulat - ng of rates and charges for the transportation of freight otherwise pro - ded for in said act; whereupon a copy of the complaint shall be served upon such railway company or common carrier in the same manner as process in civil cases is served, who shall be required to thf complaint, or file a written answer thereto within a reasonable time to be fixed by the Commission." I take it that these provisions of the law were designed by the egislature to provide a procedure by which complaints might be made nd petitions filed by all sorts of associations and all kinds of persons. think the word "association" is broad enough to include unincorporated bodies, such as commercial clubs. I also think that the word "person" ncludes an unincorporated association, and it is well known that the ourta. as a general rule, have held that it included corporations. "The term 'association' usually means an unincorporated organisa - tion composed of a body of men, partaking in its general form and mode of procedure of the characteristics of the corporation." (Knujht &gt;. N. Y. Sup. 815.) k "Under laws 1849, c. 437, the term 'association' includes every in - idual doing business alone for some purpose, under the banking Wiciham (N. Y.) 7 Abb. Prac. 134, 138.) Evidently the legislature used the word "person" in the acts referred to in the same sense as that word is used in the statutes of the state. Under the trust laws of this state the word "person" is deemed to include all corporations, associations, combinations or concerns whatsoever. (Compiled Statutes of 1909, cb. 91a, art. 2, sec. 19.) Under the criminal code of Nebraska whenever any property or interest is intended to be protected by a provision of the penal law, and the general term "person" is used to designate the person whose property is intended to be pro - tected, such term includes all public or private corporations. (Criminal Code, sec. 261) </seg>
            <seg id="p304">300 If— m I conclude that a fair construction of tbe section of the Rail - way Commission act and of the Aldrieh act would permit an unincor - porated association to make a complaint challenging the unreasonable - ness of the rates on commodities over which the Railway Commission has jurisdiction. However, I concede there is ground for debate on this question, and, in my opinion, it would be preferable to have such com - plaints made by an individual or a corporation directly interested and affected by the rates in question.

This is a private claim by a private individual against the railroad com - aiul. in my judgment, it is no part of the duty of the Railway Commission to prosecute civil suits to recover money for private in - dividuals against railroad companies. The only penalty provision I discover in connection with this matter is a fine of not less than llti.no nor more than $50.00. A criminal prose - cution, as I construe section ■"&gt;. could not be maintained against the complained of until after the party complained of has refused tu make a written statement to the party complaining, giving full reasons for the refusal to make such payment. In other words, the demand in writing for a statement of the reasons for the refusal to make such payment is a condition precedent to the right to present for the penalty of from $10.00 to $50.00. After this request has been made and failure on the part of the party complained of to furnish this written statement within thiry days thereafter, then a complaint filed with the county attorney of the proper county would be the course to be pursued by the aggrieved person. ■ My judgment is that it is not the duty of the Railway Commission utute or carry on civil suit for the recovery of a claim of a private individual against a railroad company for delay in shipment or for de - murrage.

            <seg id="p306">302 graphs 10671, etc., above referred to, on or about Febraury 1, 1909, where such company has issued its securties to a sum greatly in excess of the actual value of its properties. Very truly yours, CLARK PERKINS, Secretary Lincoln. Neb,, May 12. 1910 Nebraska State Railway Commission Lincoln, Nebraska. I am in receipt of your communication of recent date, submitting the following proposition and requesting an opinion thereon : "Is it within the jurisdiction of the Commission to order the can - cellation i of any consolidated company orgai &gt;visions of section 10671, Cob - bey's 1*09, where such company has issued its stock to an amount in excess of the actual value of its properties?" This question necessarily involves the consideration of powers con - ferred upon the Commission by the constitution and by the statutes of the state. The amendment to tl.e constitution creating the State Railway Commission, defines the power and duties of said Commission to be as follows: "The powers and duties of such Commission shall include the regulation of n ice and general control of common carriers as the legislature max by law. But In the absence of specific legislation the Comniifsion shall exercise the powers and perform the duties enumerated in this provision From the foregoing it is apparent that the authority of the Railway Commission is inferior and subje&lt; ■sislatin - railroads and railroad companies upon all matters about which the legislature has taken legislative action In recognition of this situation the legislature, at its first session after the adoption of this amendment and the election of the State Railway Commission, enacted chapter 90, Session Laws of 1907. creating and defining the pow and quali - fications of the Commission. Certain other act.- have been passed by the legislature conferring additional specific powers and duties upon the Commission. Among other acts is an act passed by the legislature of 1909, being chapter 108, Session Laws for that year, the title of which is, "an act regulating the issuance of stocks, bonds and other forms of in - debtedness of common carriers and public service corporations, and pro - viding penalties for the violation thereof" Neither in the Railway Commission act, the constitutional amendment, nor in the act of 1909 •bore referred to, is direct authority attempted to be conferred upon the Commission to cancel or order the cancellation of stocks issued by a corporation. The powers conferred upon the Commission by the con - stitutional amendment, the Railway Commission act and the act of 1909, are powers that partake more peculiarly of the nature of legislative and administrative, than of judicial, powers. </seg>
            <seg id="p307">303 L'pon a careful examination of the constitutional amendment and the acts of the legislature referred to, it would seem reasonable to conclude that the powers conferred upon the Railway Commission were for the most part administrative or supervisory. The amendment itself con - fers upon the Commission the legislative authority to regulate, which in - cludes the right to fix and establish rates to be charged by railroad companies, but the other legislative or judicial powers which the Com - mission may have the right to exercise are only such as are ancillary or incidentally necessary to carry into effect the other powers which are expressly granted. constitution, provides as follows: powers of the government of this state are divided into three distinct departments: The legislative, executive, and Judicial, and no person or collection of persons, being one of these departments, shall ise any power properly belonging to either of the others, except as hereinafter expressly directed or permitted." Having due regard for this provision of the constitution, it necessarily follows that the Railway Commission is authorized to exercise such legis - lative powers as are conferred upon it by the constitutional amendment, supplemented by the action of the legislature, and such other legislative and judical powers only as are incidentally necessary to enable it to per - form the duties for which it was created. The power to cancel the stock of corporations is distinctively a judicial function, and is to be exercised by the judical department, rather than by a department of the government whose main function is executive or administrative and clothed only with a limited or &gt;/iui»i-judicial author - ity. It has no express authority from the constitution or the statutes to cancel stock. It is doubtful if the legislature could confer upon the Commission, an administrative and a limited legislative body, a power which is so clearly a judicial function, without impinging upon the section of the constitution segregating the powers of government. In Sinkiiuj Fuwl Cattf I 700, it was said by the Supreme Court of the United States, through Justice Field, as follows: "The distinction between a judicial and a legislative act is well defined. The one determines what the law is, ami what the rights of parties are, with reference to transactions already had; the other pre - scribes what the law shall be in future cases arising under it. When - ever an act undertakes to determine a question of right or obligation, or of property, as the foundation upon which it proceeds, such act is to that extent a judicial one." The Supreme court of this state in the case of State ix rtl Thnmp- I ''If. 82 Neb. 267, had occasion to consider the division of the functions of the state government. The question involved in that case was the authority of the district judges, under section 55 of the Omaha charter, to appoint park commissioners. It was contended that so much of section 55 as undertook to authorize the judges of the dis - trict court to appoint park commissioners was unconstitutional void, as violative of the section of the constitution above quoted. </seg>

Complainant and period of over ten : claim an easement in the Couchman land to that extent, which said eas&gt; i Couchman. Recently, by reason of heav i?ht-of-way of respondent, originally occupied by complainant's public road, has been washed away, leaving a gulch or ditch about twelve feat deep and twenty feet wide. The fact that respondent company has diverted the surface water* from a dry creek several hundred yards north ol tin by means of a ditch running along the west side of its track and emptying through a trestle bridge located about twenty feet uorth of the private cross - ing, and the further fact that the elevation of respondent's roadbed impede* the natural flow of the surface waters at and south of this crowing, and concentrates their flow at the crossing, have evidently con - tributed in no small degree to the formation of the gulch and the im - pairment of the crossing. Complainant is still able to cross near the original road by turning south after leaving the track on the weat side and going around the gulch. The continued action of flood waters will gradually extend the gulch </seg>
            <seg id="p315">311 farther south, thereby increasing the angle of the road crossing, and the difficulty of transporting heavy farm machinery across respondent's tracks.

"In the matter of the right of railroad companies to exchange free transportation with local transfer and baggage companies," reported in 12 I.

May I request the reconsideration, by the Commission, of this matter and that you advise me of your conclusions? Very truly yours. N H. LOOM IS. Lincoln. Neb., October 4 Nebraska State Railway i ommission Lincoln. Nebraska. Gentlemen: — I have your.- ot the 28th ult.. in which you to give a written opinion on the question as to whether uniforn men of a local transfer company may ride on trains free, for the purpose of arranging for the care of baggage, under the exception:- of the anti - pass act of 1907. From the communications accompanying your letter I learn that a request has been made by one of the railroad companies of this state for this information, and that said compar of issuing free transportation to such uniformed checkmen as may wish to ride i trains not to exceed 150 miles west frum the city of Omaha, to tak - of baggage of passengers who go to attend large conventions or gather - ings in that city. In other words, the officials of said railroad company think it would add to their facilities for the handling of crowded trains into the larger cities. Free transportation is permitted under our law to be issued to a large number of persons, among them are officers, agents, and Ixma Me employes, the major portion of whose time is devoted to the service of said railroad company. It is clear from this provision that those </seg>
            <seg id="p319">315 NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION- classes of persons must devote the major portion of their time to the service of the company. There is another class, however, such as officials and linemen of telegraph companies, ex-employes retired from service on account of age, and their widows, necessary caretakers of lire &gt;toek. poultry, vegetables and fruit, employes of sleeping oar companies -npanies. railway mail service employes, newsboys on train, baggage a. -sons injured in wrecks, and physicians and nurses ling them. The d this nuestiuii depends upon what construction shall he tto'-ds "baggage agents. " Do these words apply to regular baggage agents riding on trains only, or do they apply as well to check - men or baggage agents who act for local transfer companies, who get upon trains near large terminals and ride into large cities while taking of the baggage of passengers? That the words "baggage agents" do not refer exclusively to such bagga- - as travel regularly upon trains is quite clear, for the reason that they are Imh 'i&lt;l&lt; employes of the railroad company who the major portion of their time to its service. Hence they a.. u id be included in the first clause of this exception and there would reason for making a special exception with reference to "baggage agent* If such an exception were necessary, it would follow that a on should have been made with reference to conductors, trainmen or clerks of the railroad company, who are also lnm&lt;t titlt employes The phraseology of nur anti-pass statute is very similar to that of the •: statute, and, as a matter of fact, it was taken therefrom. The words "baggage agents," as used in the exception clause of that law, have alreai: onstrued by the Interstate Commerce Commission, in 12 Commerce Report. 40, and were held by it to include checkmen mpanies whose duty it is to meet passenger trains mts near large terminals and to go through the trains arranging ie transfer of passengers and their baggage. If the Interstate * &lt;&gt;in i mission has construed these words to be applicable in cases of this kind under the federal law, it is certainly good precedent for your Commission to make a similar ruling under the provisions of our state law Respectfully yours.

            <seg id="p326">322 lHIKl) A.NM A 1.. KhrOK 1 The people, by amendment of the constitution, having created a ribunal with jurisdiction to carry out the foregoing provision, it be - came at once the duty of the legislature to define the powers and duties ' that tribunal and provide the manner of procedure to enfoi rders. In the performance of that duty the act in question was passed, with the evident intention to include telegraph companies, as well as railroad and express companies, within is provisions, and it was nacted that telegraph companies should file with the State Railway ommission the schedule of their rates and charges then in force, and that such rates should not be changed without the consent of that ribunal, in order to prevent abuses, unjust discriminations and extor - ons. and we are of the opinion that the act is sufficient for the accom - lishment of that purpose. Indeed, the statute in express terms declares tat telegraph companies are common carriers and are included in its revisions, and the Commission is thereby required to regulate and control such companies to the full extent permitted by the constitution, t would seem that the defendant was originally of that opinion, because filed its tariff book with the Railway Commission on the 11th day of sptember, 1907, which was shortly after the act went into effect, and again on the 3rd day of October, 1907, filed another and revised tariff book with that tribunal. While this is not of itself conclusive and may ot be binding upon the defendant, yet this may be considered as tending to show, to some extent at least, the view of the matter originally ntertained by the defendant. kWe are therefore of opinion that the terms of the act in question ply to telegraph companies, and defendant's contention on this point Duld not be sustained. Finally it is contended that the part of section 4 of the act which efines common carriers to include telegraph companies, is not within the tie of the act, and is therefore unconstitutional and void. It was admit - ed by the defendant upon the argument that the bill &lt;)&lt; ver a ouble subject, and it is conceded in defendant's brief that there are general terms contained in the title which would be broad enough to nclude regulations concerning telegraph companies if they were not restricted by other portions of the title; in other words, that the legis - ature, in attempting to make an elaborate title, has, in effect, restricted le scope of the act to railway companies and common carriers en - gaged in the business of transporting freight and passengers only. As bove stated, we are convinced that in drafting the act it was the mention of the legislature to include telegraph companies in its pro - visions, to prevent abuses, discriminations and extortions, and to that end required such companies to file a schedule of their rates with the State Railway Commission and prohibited a change or increase of such rates ithout the consent of that tribunal. It is true that the main and more pacific portions of the act refer to railway companies as common carriers of goods and passengers. But those provisions, which in their </seg>
            <seg id="p327">323 ti'l alone apply to telegraph companies, are not thereby excluded. The title to the act reads as follows: An act creating and defining the powers, duties and qualifications of the State Railway Commission and the secretary thereof, and fixing their compensation; defining railway companies and common carriers, and regulating the same, and providing the method of fixing, establishing, publishing rates, charges and classifications for the transportation of passengers, freights and cars, including joint through rates and joint traffic arrangements, over and upon the various lines of said railway companies and common carriers in this state; to provide for a system of annual reports by common carriers; the method of making, establishing and enforcing the general orders of said Commission; defining unjust ruinations; to provide penalties for the violations of the provisions of this act, and to repeal all acts or parts of acts in conflict herewith, and to declare that an emergency exists." This title is comprehensive enough to include all common carriers whether of freight or passengers, or of news and intelligence. By the ! the conjunction the legislature made it clear that the provisions of the act are intended to apply not only to railroad companies, which are at the common law carriers of passengers and freight, but also to all others kinds or classes of common carriers doing business within this By this title the legislature gave notice that it proposed to define common carriers, and by section 4 as found in the body of the act, telegraph companies are so defined. That the legislature had power to include such companies within the definition of common carriers and provide for the prevention of abuses, unjust discriminations and extor - tions, there can be no doubt. Indeed, from the very nature of telegraph companies they are common carriers, and it was so held by this court in \tgnpk Co •: I'mkrwood, S7 Neb. 315. N. W In many of the states it is held that the power to make all needful regula - tions is embraced in the common law, and in any event there is no on but telegraph companies are common carriers when they are so designated by legislative enactment. Jones, in section 30 of his work on telegraph and telephone companies, says: It is a pleasure to note the fact that most of the states have, or are enacting statutes which declare them common carriers; they are agents of the government and have the power of exercising the right of eminent domain, without which they could not invade the private property of an individual without his consent With all these privileges granted by the government, and the almost perfect control over the art of telegraphy by the late and modern improvements, it is but fair and just that they be placed under almost if not the same restrictions as that which the common law imposes on common carriers." Having the power to define and regulate telegraph companies as well as other common carriers, the legislature gave notice by the title to the act that it proposed to exercise that power, and after having given notice, it so defined them and proceeded to carry out its purpose. That this was a substantial compliance with section 11 of article 3 of the constitution, there is no doubt. We are therefore of opinion that the law in question is not vulnerable as to the constitutional objection above stated. </seg>

The findings as to matters of fact, so far as material here, axe as follows: "Protn the evidence it appears, and the t'ommission so finds that University Place is an incorporated town, having a population between 2.5(Mi and 3,500 inhabitants: that am . hundred students is located within its lin, "That there is a considerable number of merchants maintaining busi - ness houses in said city, engaged in the business of shipping, buying and selling drugs, groceries, hardware, lumber, coal, general merchandise, plumbing and building supplies.

"That the defendant company has- constructed a switch track from its main line for a distance of about two miles to a point near of the city; that carload freight alone to the extent of several hundred cars a year is delivered on said switch track; that. here com - petition enters into the service, a switching charge of $5.00 ; added to the regular tariff rate to Lincoln, on all carload shipments de - livered on said switch track; that no 'less than carload' shipment received on said switch track; and that the citizens of said city are compelled to either go to Lincoln or Havelock for such shipments, thereby causing them more or less inconvenience, and entailing •iderable and unnecessary extra expense and loss of time * • * *." * "Furthermore, it is the opinion of this Commission that the entire bnatnese of the railroad done at University Place, will not only pa penses, but indeed return a fair profit to the defendant * * • •," "We do not concur in the conclusion of counsel of defendant that the transportation facilities afforded the complainant and his fellow citizens in University Place are sufficient to satisfactorily and rea- itippljr the public need." A trial was had before the district court upon the issues thus raised, and the court found as its conclusion of fact: "That the decision of the Commission appealed from is not unreasonable or un - just wfthin the meaning of the law providing for appeals, and the appellant is not entitled to relief prayed for." The court further found, as a matter of law, that the only question for it to determine upon the ap - peal was "whether the order of the Commission is unreasonable or un - just, and if the order is found to be such that reasonable men might differ </seg>
            <seg id="p331">327 as to its correctness, it cannot be said to be unreasonable; inother words, that the court is not empowered to put itself in the place of the Commis - sion with power to substitute its own judgment of what is reasonable and just for the judgment of the Commissioners," and dismissed the appeal at the appellant's cost. Between twenty and thirty witnesses were examined at the trial. On the part of the appellant, they were principal - ly employes of the railway company and dealers in lumber, coal and building material, receiving freight mainly in carload lots, and whose places of business were situated on or near the switch belonging to the railway company, which extends from Lincoln to University Place, a distance of over two miles. On the part of the appellees, the witnesses were mainly retail merchants in the village, and private individuals residing therein. It is unnecessary to set forth the evidence at length. It supports the findings of fact made by the Railway Commission herein - before set forth. It further tends to prove that the establishment of the station would be of considerable benefit and accommodation to per- in the retail business in University Place on account of the fact that, as matters now are, freight in smaller lots than 6,000 pounds, or less than carload lots, is not delivered upon the switch by the railway company, but can only be delivered at Lincoln or Have - lock, and from either of these points must be delivered to University ► ither by means of the Morris Transportation Company, a com - pany operating a freight and express business over the lines of The Lincoln Traction Company {which is a street railway corporation, whose onnect Lincoln and Havelock, via University Place), or by being hauled by drays from the respective railway stations to the point of delivery. It is also shown that -passengers arriving or departing from local trains could save much time if there was a station house at or near Warren avenue, the point where the station was ordered to be erected. On the other hand, the appellant's evidence tends to show that the cost of drayage from the proposed station to the stores in the village would be but little, if any. less than is now charged for delivery from Havelock or Lincoln. It is also shown that the station at Havelock is less than a mile further frcm the business center of Universty Place than the site of the proposed station, which is nearly three-fourths of a mile from such center as it now is. It is four and one-fourth miles by street railway from the Chicago. R. I. ft P. passenger station in Lincoln to I'niversity Place, and fifteen minutes street car service. From the center of the business iwrtion of University Place to the station of the company in Havelock is one and one-half miles. This station is also reached by the street car lines with thirty minutes service from Univer - sity Place to Havelock. At present there are no sidewalks from the business portion of University Place to the proposed site, and there are no houses within a few blocks. The testimony of the appellant's wit - nesses is to the effect that the cost of erecting the station building, house track and passing track, wells, stockyards, scales, etc., would amount to nearly $18,000.00 and that the annual maintenance cost would </seg>

            <seg id="p334">330 THIRD ANNUAL REPORT whether the order of the Commission is 'unreasonable' — quite a different thins." Unless the plaintiff is able to show by clear and satisfactory evidence that the order of the Commission complained of is unlawful or unreason - able, as the ca*e may be, the order must stand. The words "clear and satisfactory evidence" are significant, because at the time of the enact - ment of this statute they were used in the law of this state to describe a degree of proof greater than a preponderance of evidence, and such as was necessary in order to establish fraud by that party to an action upon whom the burden of proof rested. We must hold that in the statute before the Court the legislature used the words "clear and satisfactory" in this sense, and intended they should describe that degree of proof necessary to establish fraud or prove mistake in a written instrument. A similar conclusion was reached by the Supreme Court of Oklahoma in AtHtimm, I &lt;1 &gt; /■ I IC . 16, and in I T. «f ■ W. h. H Pac 262, and by the Supreme Court of Louisiana in tforya*&gt; 1~ A T.

V K ('&lt;&gt; to establish a station at Blue Springs, a town of about 1 le, at a point outside of the corporate limits of Blue Springs, and about a mile and a half from another station at the town of Wymore Considering the facts in the Nebraska case, and comparing them with those in the Illinois cas think the comparison clearly demonstrates that what might be considered just and reasonable and necessary by one court, may be considered unjust and unreasonable by another. If tile order to establish a station at Rlue Springs under the circumstances at the time and place was just and reasonable to provide necessary facilities for the public, then we are convinced that the order establishing a station at University Place falls within that category. The railroad company insists that the cost of constructing a station and necessary sidetracks, etc., would much exceed the pecuniary benefit derived by it from such establishment, would not justify the outlay, and would be to that extent conflscatory. The cost of the proposed im - provement is not in all cases a proper test for determining the reason - ■btaiese of such an order. It is proper to be taken into consideration. </seg>
            <seg id="p335">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 331 but it is not controlling. It is not contended that the amount to be ex - &lt;i is so excessive that it will diminish the company's revenues, relatively, to any great extent. The mere fact that the income from the expenditure at that particular point upon its line may not earn a fair return upon the capital invested at that point can only be considered in ■ tion with the revenue from the entire operation of the road within the state, at least. As said by Mr Justice White in his opinion in It. &lt;'n. r. Ctroliiio ■ nimimum, 206 U. S. "It follows, therefore, that the mere incurring of a loss from the performance of such a duty does not in and of itself necessarily give rise ton of unreasonableness, as would be the case where the whol&lt; m unreasonable under the doctrine of Smyth r under the concessions made in the two propositions we have rse. the fact that the furnishing of a necessary facility ■ asion an incidental pecuniary loss is an important criteiia ■ view in determining the reasonableness of the order, but &gt;nly one. As the duty to furnish necessary facilities is minous with the powers of the corporation, the obligation to dis - ■ that duty must be considered in connection with the nature and productirMMM of the corporate business as a whole, the character of the &gt; 'iiiired. and the public need for its performance." See, also, Mnimn, ITS i /.. rf- T. H 6 &amp; - I II. It It 'I that the place designated for the erection ol the ii is upon a curve and at a point where the track is elevated and ■ and wet The order, however, does not require the m of the station exactly at the intersection of Warren avenue. It will be a sufficient compliance if it is placed at a point as near as HTM avenue, consistent with the safe, necessary and n of the railway, and having regard to public convenience, ami tl inmission. Ipon the whole case, the evidence convinces us that the principal ground for complaint is the lack of facilities for the reception and send - ing out of freight in less than carload lots, and that it is open to question whether the necessity of a station at the point designated for the accom - on of passenger traffic alone would be enough to justify the Com - mission in making the ordei. The street car facilities from University Place to Havelock and to Lincoln stations of the railway company, and the means of delivery of personal baggage, are perhaps as convenient for passengers as from many points within the corporate limits of the city of Lincoln. However, it is not the inconvenience to passengers alone, but the whole demand for both freight and passenger service that must be considered, and if, taking all the circumstances into consideration, the order is not unreasonable, we have no power to set it aside. Under all the facts in evidence, and giving the statutory presumption proper weight, we are satisfied that the order of the Commission is not unreasonable, and the judgment of the district court so finding is affirmed. </seg>

The testimony of the employe in charge of the advertising depart - ment of the defendant in regard to the customary dealings with news - paper owners under the contract is to the effect that the advertisements placed in all such newspapers are to be charged at the regular rate </seg>
            <seg id="p339">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 335 charged by the newspaper in each case to the public generally for the same service, which would vary in different localities; that a statement or bill would be rendered by the publisher for the advertising done, and that the transportation issued did not exceed the value of the advertis - ing when the transportation wa« measured at tne rate of 2 cents per mile; that it was not issued when the advertising was placed, but after the advertising had been run, and the statement of the amount due fol - lowed ; that the transportation issued did not exceed the amount of the bills rendered and that special forms of trip, 500-mile and l,0©0-mile tickets were issued under these contracts It is also shown that the railroad company had no permission or authority from the Railway Commission to enter into the contracts, either before or after their execution. The Attorney General contends that the contracts, and the tickets issued in conformity therewith, constitute a violation of the acts popular - ly known as the "Railway Commission act," chapter 90, page 311, Laws ion 10649-10663, inclusive, Annotated Statutes 1909), the "Anti- Pass act." chapter 9:f, page 342, Laws 1907 (Sections 10664-10665 An - notated Statutes 1909) and the "2-Cent Pare Law," chapter 92, page 341 Laws 1M1 (Sections 10618-10623, inclusive. Annotated Statutes 1909), and that the transportation issued under the contract constituted a special in unjust discrimination, and an unreasonable preference, as de - fined by said acts. He takes the broad ground that transportation furnished by a railroad company for any consideration other than a money consideration, to an adult, and at a rate other than 2 cents per mile, constitutes an unjust discrimination prohibited by law. The defendant contends that, under the contract, the railroad corn - pay paid for the advertising furnished at the regular published and current ra &gt;&gt;dita upon its books for the amount furnished, and that the transportation was paid for at the full legal rate of 2 cents per mile by such credits; that the Nebraska law is designedly different 'he Interstate Commerce acts in that it does not prohibit "dif - ferent" compensation for transportation, and does not limit payment to cash only; that if the act had regulated the medium of payment it would iieen unconstitutional; that there was no attempt to discriminate, or to violate the 2-cent fare law, and that what was done had no such effect. The sections of the statutes controlling the case are as follows: "It shall be unlawful for any railroad corporation operating, or which shall hereafter operate, a railroad in this state to charge, collect, demand, or receive for the transportation of any passenger over twelve years of age, with baggage, not exceeding 200 pounds in weight, on any train over its line of road in the state of Nebraska, a sum exceeding 2 cents per mile, pwided, that no railroad company shall be required to sell any ticket for less than 5 cents."

To procure uniformity there must be a standard measurement. The only measure possible, in order to insure ne charge, is the standard medium of exchange - , money Hut. it is contended, although the rate charged for advertising varies in different localities, yet the amount - the regular current rate charged to the public generally iu that locality, and that since the railway company would be required to pay this rate in money for the advertising fur - 1. it is not discrimination to pay for it in transportation at the argument loses sight of two considerations: First, that no at rate of charges for the advertising is fixed in the contract. The publication is to be "at agreed rates," leaving the parties free to fix for 'it. the value of the service rendered and the I paid. It is irue that the witness testifies that the agreement ■n t he same as the current rate for advertising in the ll nothing in the contract which requires the price I upon to be the current rate to the public generally. A contract which permits transportation to be issued in exchange for a product or ivicts. the value of which is indeterminate, and which leaves the tmk by agreement of the parties, plainly leaves the price of ::insportation a variable quantity.

If the magazine is taying $600.00 to the defendant, why does it accept transportation both f less and different value than it would accept if it bought its tickets with money? Why embarrass itself with menacing pains and penalties or failure to observe all the conditions of the special contract, when y the use of cash it may travel and give no concern to technical limi - tations? It seems fair to conclude that either the advertising is of less han cash value, or the advertisers are grossly imposed upon by the ail roads."
