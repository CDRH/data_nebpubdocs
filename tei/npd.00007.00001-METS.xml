K. 9. This section has given rise to much controversy, and many disputed still remain unsettled. The following opinions seem to be well founded: 1. The schoolhouse was erected for school purposes, and cannot legally be used for any other purpose that will interfere with its use for this. V room in a schoolhouse not needed for school purposes may be leased for nrpose not injurious to the school, or a detriment to the usefulness of the other parts of the building for school purposes; but the contract for such lease cannot extend beyond the close of the school year I The right to determine whether a schoolhouse shall be used for othepthan 1 purposes belongs to the voters of the district when assembled in a lawful er; but when the district has not acted on the subject the board has con - intil some action is taken by the district. But neither board nor district ny right to allow the schoolhouses to be used in such a way as to Interfere tha school. Kthe voters of the district wish to use the schoolhouse for meetings of kinds, there seems to be no good reason why they may not so use it so they do not interfere with the school work. The decisions of the su- I'ourts of Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, and many other states confirm this Kansas, Mew Jersey, and West Virginia confer upon the trustees, by the ritfht to use the house for such purposes. In the absence of any i by our owu court* the above rulings will govern thi» department. </seg>

(8) Interest on delinquent school district taxes. — In this state interest is allowed as compensation for the use or with - holding of money (Bell v. Arndt, 24 Neb., 261); and a county treasurer who collected interest on delinquent school district taxes did so because certain taxpayers withheld from the school district money which should have been paid at an earlier date. Such interest, therefore, accrues to the school district and not to the treasurer or to the county. It is a part of the school dis - trict funds. Under section 169, article 1, chapter 77, Compiled Statutes, it is the duty of the county treasurer to turn such taxes and inter - eat over to the school district.
