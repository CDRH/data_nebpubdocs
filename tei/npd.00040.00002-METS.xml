President Roberts: Are there any delegates present whose cre- dentials have not been handed in to the Credentials Committee? S. B. Otto represents Hamilton County. A. J. Ruddy represents Boone County. President Roberts: Are there any corrections? What will you do with the report, gentlemen? Walsh: I move the report be adopted as read. A Member: I second the motion. President Roberts: I think it would be well to continue this com- mittee until tomorrow; there are other delegates that might come in. Are you ready for the question? Graff: Before you put the question I wish to make a statement The Committee on Credentials had but one which appeared to us to </seg>
            <seg id="p010">10 PEOCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE be a contest, and that was from Holt County. We have decisions from the court in regard to that matter and we decided to go according to law, so we recognized the decision and gave the organization at O'Neill, the county seat, their credentials to participate in this meet - ing. They have another organization up there in the same county, an older one, but I do not think you would want to take up the time (and I would hate to be compelled to read all this matter, anyway) to go into this. The organization contesting for representation here is quite p good many years old but it appears to be illegally organized, and did not have any statutory standing. If there are any friends of that or - ganization here they could perhaps explain it better than I could and would refer it to the house for a decision; the committee did not feel they wanted to decide in any other way. President Roberts: Those favoring the motion before the house will monifest it by saying Aye; contrary No. Motion carried unanimously. McLeod: If there is a contest in Dodge County, I believe we shouli allow representation from two different societies as we do in Holt Coun - ty. Chambers has had a representative here for several years. I at - tended the fair a great many years in the south end of the county; and if they have a .regular organization there if we can allow two or- ganizations to be represented from Dodge County why cannot we all two organizations from Holt County? President Roberts: My understanding is that the county meeting you have referred to has not been recognized by the commissioners of that county in making an appropriation to the fair; they have only recognized one. In Dodge County they have recognized the two fairs in making their appropriation. McLeod: Wisner had a fair and the county commissioners did not recognize it. It is merely a matter whether we recognize them or not, and according to the rules and regulations we have been allowing any well organized society to be represented. President Roberts: Chambers has always had representation and I think it is entitled to representation; but it is up to this body. A Member: I move we allow representation from Chambers and O'Neill in Holt County. Walsh: I second the motion. Grimes: I am a delegate from the Chambers association, I have been sent here by the vice-president of the association and can say the association has been running for twenty-three years and has been rec - ognized by the county commissioners every fall until this fall. We have always drawn the state appropriation and now the O'Neill or - ganization again came in one year ago and the county commissioners have decided for them this year but we have taken up the matter in court; the district court has decided against us and the Supreme Court has the case and whatever decision they make will probably settle it but that is the way the matter stands now. </seg>
            <seg id="p011">11 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE McArdle: Did you hold a fair last year? Grimes: Yes sir. Hunter: I am a representative of the Holt County Fair associa - tion from O'Neill; you see there is not much controversy between us, we are good friends and I would like to see the Chambers fair asso - ciation represented in this organization; they are entitled to it. (Ap - plause.) Hunter: Of course we think we have done a little better; we have had a better opportunity. They are located twenty-five miles off the railroad but we have given them good representation from O'Neill when they have conducted a fair. A great many of the older members are acquainted with this young man's father, J. D. Grimes, who was a mem - ber of the organization for a great many years, attended the fair and was one of the best citizens we had in the county, and it looks to me very much as if the young man was following in his steps. I want to say, aside from that, I think we are already legally organ - ized and entitled to the position we are claiming. He is not the only good man they have around Chambers, in fact that are not many there who are not. Calls for the question. Walsh: I move you as an amendment that this matter be laid before the Committee on Credentials, that committee is appointed for that specific purpose. President Roberts: The chairman of that committee gave us a full description of what has been done; I do not believe they could go into it any deeper than they have. Those favoring the motion manifest it by saying Aye; contrary No. Carried unanimously. Secretary Mellor: Mr. President, I think it would be a good time at this time to make nominations for the coming year, from the different districts, so the Australian ballot, as is customary, can he printed over night and the votes can be counted tomorrow. Mann: I would like to make a motion asking for another mem - ber in the Sixth district, if it would be in order before the nominations are made. President Roberts: I presume it will be in order if the members want to take it up at this time. How would you want to proceed with that, Mr. Mann? Mann: When we organized we divided into districts, so many members in each district, and the Sixth only got five members to rep - resent the district I think I remember at that time I asked for another member but it was passed over. In the revision of the state we divided into congressional districts and the number of votes in the district was to be the factor in determining the number of members for that district. We now have five representatives, we are now going to the nominations and if we succeed, and I think it only right, it will mean another nomination for the Sixth district. Here is the vote, gentlemen, and the members of the different congressional districts: </seg>
            <seg id="p012">12 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE K district vote, 32,126; and I will tell you how many we have in district — five. Second district, 28,875. Third, 25,987. Fourth, !. Fifth, 36,190. Sixth, 50,829. This is the congressional vote of the districts. When we organ - ized on this district plan, and it was decided to determine the number of delegates by the congressional vote we were only given five. I asked for six at that time and now I ask this year for another member to be put in that district. McArdle: Where would you suggest this other member to come from? President Roberts: We are limited to a certain number of mem - bers, we would have to take one from another district and put it in the sixth, Mann: I am not antagonizing members from any other district, five in the first, three in the second, five in the third, six in the fourth, five in the fifth and five in the sixth. I am not bringing it up against any district individually, but in the fourth they have 38,632 and in the sixth 50,829. Youngers: The trouble is you have too many votes out there. Mann: I cannot help that, I don't know where these votes come from. Mann: Gentlemen, I am asked to read the vote again Secretary Mellor: The first, third, fifth and sixth have five each, the second has three and six in the fourth. Mann: I think we are entitled to one more man in our sixth district; the fourth has six. Of course I am not saying who should be left out of the fourth but it is not giving us in the sixth fair repre - sensation. I make this as a motion, that one be taken from the fourth district, where they have six and we only have five, and added to the sixth. Won't that be right? President Roberts: It is up to the house, Mr. Mann. Secretary Mellor: I second the motion. President Roberts: The motion is made and seconded that we take one from the fourth and put in the sixth district Are there any remarks? Danielson: It would be nothing more than natural, I suppose, for a man from the fourth district to stand up for that district. Mr. Mann has given an explanation of why they are increasing in the big sixth, as I might state it If this keeps on we will have the whole Board up there. Purcell: Ask the gentleman from the fourth if he does not want to sell out Danielson: Laying all jokes aside, gentlemen, from the situation the State Board of Agriculture is in at the present time, I think we need representatives where they can do business for this state fair. In order to do that, we need these little fifty cent pieces that come in the gate. You haver eleven counties in the fourth; from the state </seg>
            <seg id="p013">13 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE line on the south Gage; and Seward, Butler and Polk on the north which practically over half surrounds Lincoln. Your railroad facil - ities in and out of Lincoln are the best you could ask for and I am going to ask the members to take this under consideration before they take a vote on it and, like Mr. Mann, I am going to leave it up to the Board. President Roberts: Are there any other remarks on the question? Smith: Living in the sixth district, it would be natural for me to be in hearty accord with Mr. Mann because I think it is just. If the basis was made in years past on equity, why should it not be based on equity now? If this report is right and Brother McArdle says it is not right because it is published in the Journal, we have approxi - mately fifty thousand votes in the sixth. You give us one member for each sixty-five hundred in the fourth and one member for every ten thousand in the sixth; that is not just. If you can adjust it and not increase your Board, and you can, I believe you had better give the sixth another and believe you will increase your attendance from the sixth. You have to go somewhere to get your increase in the at - tendance, you cannot get any more from the fourth, they all come down who can come, and the population is not increasing in the fourth like in the sixth. Von Forell: It would not make any difference if I were living in Omaha or on the Wyoming line, but I believe that six members for 38,000 and five members for 50,000 is not an equitable distribution. As to the fifty cent pieces, I realize, with all the rest of you, that they are absolutely essential and a good thing but I believe from the Wyom - ing line, from my county and from Charley Mann's county, and sev - eral others out there we are sending as large representations and try - ing just as hard to take an interest in this state fair; we are trying a little harder, just about the time our state fair comes off we have a big show in Denver and also a Wild West show in Cheyenne. The natural inclination of the people would be to go to one of these but the loyalty they feel to the state of Nebraska and her institutions has caused the people of my county to come to the State Fair and, I speak because I know, they go to the trouble and expense of bringing ex - hibits to this State Fair not because they receive more benefits than they would from neighboring states but because it is our own com - monwealth. I believe we of the sixth who come to this fair have to pay greater mileage and go to more trouble to show our intense loy - alty to our own institutions, and I believe we should have the repre - sentation commensurate with the population and vote we have in that country. It is not a question of injustice to anyone but I believe it is absolutely fair play according to the rules of representation in this association and I think we should live up to these rules, and the highest sense of fair play; I believe you are all with us in that President Roberts: You understand you all have the opportunity to express your views before we vote on the question. </seg>
            <seg id="p014">14 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Doyle: While I realize, if the figures given by Mr. Mann are cor - rect, that it is not probably just, on the other hand you will notice the third with 25,000 has five representatives. A Member: 45,000; you set down the wrong figures. Doyle: If we are going to adjust, we should adjust the whole thing. Mitchell: I happen to see myself lined up in the fourth district. I am a new member and am not well posted but it seems to me to bring this matter up unexpectedly and take a vote on it without giv - ing much chance for studying the question is hurrying things. Why would it not be advisable to refer it to a committee to investigate, then report and we can take intelligent action? President Roberts: The only thing is we must make the nomi - nations today so as to give the names to the printer, to prepare the Australian ballots so we can have the same tomorrow morning, when we vote. Rudge: There will probably be enough nominations made to fill the ticket President Roberts: It might be and if the house so desire will let it go over until tomorrow. Secretary Mellor: We could have the ballot printed, so as to read "vote for three" and "vote for four" in the fourth district It would be only two or three in the sixth, I guess. We could have it in duplicate to pass on it tomorrow morning, if you desire to put it over. I don't think you would object, Mr. Mann, to putting it over until tomorrow? Mann: All right Von Forell: I would amend that motion of Mr. Mann's as follows: That a committee of three be appointed to make an equitable distribu - tion of delegates or representatives or members, rather, from the var - ious districts according to the population. President Roberts: Taking in all the districts? It has been sug - gested that we make a committee of six, one from each district. Von Forell: I change it to one from each district, making a total of six. I further want to move that each district name its own man. McArdle: I second the motion. Danielson: I simply want to make a statement, there is a possi - bility of a tie. Secretary Mellor: Then it could be decided by this Board. Leftwich: When do I understand this committee is to work? President Roberts: Tomorrow morning. You have heard the amendment to the motion, that a committee of six be appointed to re - port tomorrow morning on the distribution of members from each district Are you ready for the question? Those in favor say Aye, contrary No. Calls for a rising vote The Secretary reported ayes 32, noes 16 President Roberts: Motion prevails. </seg>
            <seg id="p015">15 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Rudge: It seems to me this committee should be selected at this time so they can have a meeting this evening. If we put it off the committee would not be appointed until tomorrow morning and won't be ready to make a report. President Roberts: Good suggestion, Mr. Rudge. Rudge: From the first district, I would like to suggest Colonel Leonard. A Member: Would it not be practicable to have a short inter - mission and let the members of the different districts get together and say who they want? A Member: From the second district we will use Mr. Walsh. A Member: From the fourth Ed. Danielson A Member: From the third Mr. Graff. A Member: From the fifth George Jackson Mr. Jackson asked to be excused. A Member: From the fifth James Ryan Danielson: It may not have occurred to many of the members here that we are calling this banquet for 6:15; how long do you sup - pose that will last? Secretary Mellor: Until nine o'clock. Tonight we have asked Professor Condra to display the state fair films between 9:30 and 10:15 and I think we could get through the banquet and get there in time to see these films. Quite a number have not seen them and we have some splendid films. Danielson: It appears to be it is going to make this committee work in the small, wee hours of the morning. Secretary Mellor: You can get together at one table. The com - mittee by districts is as follows: The first, Leonard; the second, Walsh; the third, Graff; the fourth, Danielson; the fifth, Ryan, and the sixth, Mann. A Member: I move the members as named be selected as the committee. Seconded and carried. President Roberts: Nominations are in order from the first dis - trict We will take them up by districts. Secretary Mellor: The ones who go out, in the first, whose terms expire at this meeting are C. H. Rudge and L. W. Leonard. Dickman: I nominate C. H. Rudge. Banning: I nominate L. W. Leonard. President Roberts: Are there any more nominations from the first? Rudge: I am going to ask the gentleman who nominated me if he will not kindly withdraw the nomination. I am sure you all realize I have been very much interested during the last fourteen or fifteen years in the work of the State Board of Agriculture. I have enjoyed </seg>
            <seg id="p016">16 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE the work and I still enjoy the work and I enjoy the bunch of men 1 meet at the meetings here and at the State Fair but I have other rea - sons which make almost impossible for me to accept the office this year or perhaps in the future. I think I owe more to my family than I do to the State Board of Agriculture. Mrs. Rudge is afflicted with hay fever which usually comes on about the middle of August and this last year was a very severe one for her. And for a number of months she had some very bad results from the hay fever. I find it impossible to get her to leave the state unless I go with her; you will agree with me that after we have been living as man and wife for thirty years you feel you do not want them to go away alone, at least you do not want to go alone yourself and I am in that position. I should take her away, I must take her away during the middle of August and stay until the middle of September or the first of October. My per - sonal business does not keep me from taking her, but the state work does and I am going to ask you if you will not relieve me from the duties of the State Board of Agriculture. I have looked over the field here to find a man who would meet all the requirements, I have taken a good deal of time to get the right man for this work, while I have found a good many business men in the state or in the county who would be glad to have this position and, in some sense, would be a good candidate for it there is always some reason why they could not give the time and attention it requires. I have selected a man I think would meet with your approval and would like to place in nomination Charles Strader of Lincoln, Nebraska, as a member of the State Boa j of Agriculture. President Roberts: I know every member here regrets very much losing Mr. Rudge as a member of this Board and I see no reason why Mr. Rudge cannot become a member of thi;- State Board of Agriculture and be relieved from the Board of Managers. He can help us out and go away when he wants to, with his wife, we grant him that priv - ilege and can consult with him up to that time. We would be glad to have him stay on and if he so chooses he can be relieved from the Board of Managers and still be a member of the State Board of Agri - culture. He will then be free to go on a visit when he wishes, others do that and we would like to have Mr. Rudge retained on that Board and I believe every other member would. Leonard: It has been my pleasure to work with Mr. Rudge in almost every capacity that we could be placed in, on the State Board of Agriculture, and I heartily agree with the President that he could still be a member of the State Board of Agriculture and be absent from the state after the first of August, if he wishes, or before so far as that is concerned. It might be in the future if we still retain him as a member of the State Board of Agriculture he would come back and take up his work with us, which I feel sure has been satisfactory to every man with whom he has been connected on this Board. I would really like to acquiesce in every wish of Mr. Rudge but the right thing </seg>
            <seg id="p017">17 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE to do is to retain him on the State Board of Agriculture and give him full permission to go away if he wants to, during the Fair. President Roberts: I hope Mr. Rudge will re-consider this and ;! though as valued a member as he is the State Board of Agriculture will try to get along without him for a short time while he goes away a duty, to the health of his wife. Secretary Mellor: During fourteen years, I might say nearly fifteen years active co-operations and participation in the work with Charley Rudge, I have come to feel he is almost a necessity for the best business interests of this Board. It is really necessary, in a city like Lincoln or if this Fair was held in Omaha it would be necessary in the city of Omaha to have a man who was in touch with the business and political life of the city so that certain things can be done. There are a great many things Charley Rudge has done that I could not do, or anyone else not in active touch with the business life of Lincoln. Another thing, there has never been a duty imposed on Mr. Rudge but what he has performed that duty to the best of his ability. I have tried not to bother him much, since I have been here, aside from the time of holding the State Fair, but have gone to him for advice many times when things have come up upon which the Secretary should be advised and I wish to say there is no better adviser in the state of Nebraska than Charlie Rudge. Still when he came to me and said he felt he must get oft* the Board and knowing the physical condition of Mrs. Rudge that she is a great sufferer from hay fever, and like a great many of our wives, she does not desire to go away alone. Ex - cept for this place on the Board of Managers they could go and enjoy each other's company. Therefore, I told Mr. Rudge that I thought it would be th« proper thing if wife so desires, for him to be relieved of these duties at the present time. I wish he would take a plain mem - bership on the Board and allow someone else to assume the respon - sibilities for a year or two so we might have him back again if the opportunity presents itself. You men may think this is a part of the "three in one," or Triumvirate, as .the saying was, but men, any of you who have had dealings with this man Rudge know it is not neces - sary to say anything in defense of that particular charge as he is an adviser of the best capacity. We can get a number of people from Lancaster county, the woods are full of them, who would like to be members of the State Board of Agriculture but it is a question of getting the right man; one who can do the right thing for the benefit of the Board at the right time. It is a little different being here in Lincoln than it would be in any other locality in the state, therefore I hope Mr. Rudge will consent to allow us to use him as a member of the Board even if he should not be on the Board of Managers or have any active participation at the time of the Fair. We would be glad to have him go and stay as long as he wants to, but I would be glad to have him here for a little advice at a time when advice is neces- </seg>

Leonard: Let us ask him to do that and be a member. Rudge: I do not know when I have had so many compliments given me but I thoroughly appreciate them. My object in withdraw - ing frcm this Board was. I do not think any man can do his duty to the State Board of Agriculture unless he can be on the grounds and be in the work not only during the Fair but throughout the year. I am perfectly willing, throughout the year, to give as much of my time as I have in the past as I am interested in the State Fair and expect I will drive out to the grounds as often in the next ten years as I have in the past ten years and I want you to feel if I am not on the Board you can call on me at any time for advice. If I should go away, perhsps fcr a month. I know I would be tempted to come back and spend three or four days at the Fair for I could not keep away from it. I feel a little inclined, if it is the wish of a large majority, to remain on the Board, but I request that I be left off the Board of Managers. (Applause.) President Roberts: It gives me great pleasure to hear Mr. Rudge say that Rudge: I think the way things are turning out I would be allowed to withdraw the name of Mr. Strader. Secretary Mellcr: Mr. Rudge's selection of Mr. Strader is a splendid one as he is a splendid man, and a thorough worker in any - thing he goes into.

PRESIDENT'S REPORT Fellow Members of the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture: In reviewing briefly our work of the past year, I do so with a feeling of gratitude to all those who did their part to make the 1914 State Fair one of the best, if not the best, in its history. I cannot recall the time when the great University, State Farm, Pure Food, and Creamery exhibits were so united in doing all in their power to make our fair a success. The demonstration and information given in old Horticulture building by Professors Condra, Pugsley and others representing the State Farm, show the great work that institution is doing. The interested farmer and his boys could get in a few days, the essence of work that has taken years for some of the ablest men our state to formulate and condense. Through the combined efforts of Mr. Harmon and Mr. Wilkinson, the old Agricultural building was certainly worthy the comment given by all who visited it, and these gentlemen deserve much credit for the great display placed on exhibition there. We appreciate the new feature of a dining car placed on the grounds by the Burlington railroad officials, which gave everyone an opportunity to get a splendid meal. Our new Agriculture-Horticulture building, under the supervision of Mr. James and his co-workers, exceeded all our expectations, and many admitted that the exhibit in that building alone was worth the admission price to the grounds. The Better Babies contest under the care of Mrs. Vance and her selected help, could be no other than the great success it proved. The exhibit in horses, cattle, swine and sheep was up to its usual standard of excellence, and the men in charge are to be congratulated on its success. Our sheep department is coming to the front fast, and we pre - dict a great future for the sheep industry of Nebraska and adjoin - ing states. More poultry was on exhibition this year than ever before, and I was informed that the birds were of a higher class than at any previous fair. The machinery exhibit was reduced some from former years. We </seg>
            <seg id="p020">20 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE regret very much that some of the large firms decided not to meet with us this year, but were pleased to note firms not exhibiting here - tofore were represented on the fair grounds and were satisfied with results. We believe there is no way that the manufacturer of ma - chinery can get his goods before the farmers of the state with as little expense as at our state fair, and we hope that after trying the experiment at all fairs, they will decide to be with us next year, as - suring them that the Board will do all in its power to make it both pleasant and profitable for them. To handle the concession department properly is a difficult task, and requires men of judgment and experience. Our capable superin - tendent and his efficient help has taken care of this in a satisfactory manner both to the concessionaire and the fair. Our attractions were such that pleased everyone, and beyond criti - cism. Our idea of attractions is that nothing be permitted on the grounds that would be objectionable, so that the patrons of our fair leave the gates with minds and ideas as pure as when they enter. Our secretary and myself attended a few of the county fairs, in - cluding Scribner, Hooper, Albion and Douglas, each of which was a credit to the county and the men in charge. Albion fair was especially well attended, and those who visited it were well repaid. It was un - fortunate that Hooper and Scribner held their fairs on the same dates, although you would never believe in attending either, that another of equal success wes in operation within about seven miles. If those two had been combined, Dodge county would rank among the be3t in the state. Your delegates selected to attend the National Association of Fairs and Expositions at Chicago, had a most pleasant and profitable meet - in*. We learn from those meetings how the different states handle the many complications that confront the management of all fairs, and after exchanging views and ideas, we return with a feeling that, al - though we have learned many things of value to us, we have also rules and ideas in the management of our fair that others readily adopt. We are glad to inform you that our worthy Secretary W. R. Mellor was unanimously elected President as predicted long ago, and although we are criticised at home (for our name only) the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture was recognized by that association in a most flattering manner. The lack of funds in our treasury will not permit me to make any recommendations for extensive improvements at this time, although our needs are many. The one improvement most needed is a new swine barn, and if the legislators in their wisdom see fit to make an appro - priation for thta purpose, it will help one of the greatest industries in our state. The sanitation of our grounds has been greatly improved in the past years, but more might be done if means were available. </seg>
            <seg id="p021">21 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Taking into consideration the six inches of rain during the week of our fair, it was marvelous how the people attended in such num - bers, so we are encouraged in the thought that had the weather been favorable, Nebraska would have had a record-breaking fair, with money on hand to meet needed improvements. In conclusion, I want to thank the superintendent and employees for their efficient work in the various departments assigned to them, realizing that on them much depends for the success or failure of our fair. Respectfully submitted, JOSEPH ROBERTS, President. President Roberts: We will now listen to the report of the Sec- retary: SECRETARY'S REPORT To the Officers and Members of the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture: Greeting : Paradoxical as it may seem, 1914 was a year of prosperity for Nebraska and of adversity for the State Board of Agriculture. Pros - perity for the state at large in the gathering of a nearly average crop and adversity for this Board by reason of four days of rain — Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday in which period of time, during the holding of our annual fair 6.78 inches of rainfall came, primarily causing a deficit of $15,373.57 between the receipts and expenditures of our 1914 State Fair. The farmers of Nebraska, up to the present time, have been ex - tremely fortunate in escaping the dreaded foot and mouth disease which has made its appearance in each of the agricultural states to the east of us, and despite ravages of hog cholera, which statistics show as an aggregate loss of more than $8,000,000.00 during 1914, are enjoying more than an average of prosperity. This fact is very largely due to the effect of the European war, which has caused sharp advances in food products and animals. This is plainly shown in the fact of a doubling in the price of wheat since the first of August, when the average for wheat in Nebraska was sixty cents per bushel. With a fair corn crop and the best wheat and alfalfa crop the state has ever known, with prevailing war prices for all food products the farm - ers of Nebraska should enjoy the greatest mead of prosperity. This prosperous condition would have been reflected in our Fair attendance and receipts under normal conditions. We think it can be truthfully said that with the single exception of the machinery display, the 1914 Nebraska State Fair was the most complete, balanced line of exhibits ever assembled at any Nebraska Fair. The attractions have never been excelled as to class, and promptness as to time advertised. We all realize that it is an extremely difficult proposition to secure </seg>
            <seg id="p022">22 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE * attractions and some people in by-gone days, when asked to come e Fair, have remarked that they did not care to go because it was same old thing." We suppose they do not care to breathe because it is the same old air; or care to eat because it is the same old food, or to drink because it is the same old water — why, we would even be led to believe that they did not care to love because it would be the same old kiss or the same old squeeze. It is probably true there is nothing new under the sun, but it is refreshing to meet people who enjoy the old, homely things in life. Plan of Grounds In planning for the future this Board of Agriculture builded better than they knew when, several years ago, they passed an order that all permanent buildings should be erected around the outer edge '.f the grounds with a park in the center, so as to permit of future covered walks from one building to another so our patrons could make the entire circuit of exhibits and grandstand without exposure to in - clement weather conditions. This idea is now being advanced by some of the larger fairs, who begin to realize the haphazard method of plac - ing the buildings as nearly as possible in the center of the grounds is a costly mistake. Swine Bam The possible erection of the proposed swine barn just north of the Seventeenth street entrance fits very nicely in our proposed plan and should the legislature consider such a building necessary and make an appropriation for same, the farmers of Nebraska will have a pride in pointing to a show place which is fully warranted by the wonder - ful swine industry of the state. The showing of swine at the Nebraska State Fair is the second largest in the United States and in the year 1913 was the largest. This is in keeping with the fact that Nebraska has more swine per capita of population than any other state except Iowa. Nebraska Conservation and Public Welfare Commission The legislature of 1913 created a Nebraska Conservation and Pub lie Welfare Commission, and named as such Committee: The Governor of the State of Nebraska. The Chancellor of the University. The Director of Conservation and Soil Survey. The Secretary of the State Board of Agriculture. The Director of the Legislative Reference Bureau. The appropriation made to this Commission was $5,000, which has been expended for a moving picture outfit and the completion of about twenty finished reels on products and interesting features of Nebraska. On reel of the above mentioned number is of the "Better </seg>
            <seg id="p023">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 23 Babies" exhibit and two more of the State Fair. As your Secretary, in accordance with requirements of the activities of such Commission during the past year, I have assisted or shown pictures in the following cities and towns: McCook, Scotts Bluff, Grand Island, Blair, Fair - bury, Beatrice, Fremont, Seward and Loup City in Nebraska; Chicago, Illinois and Minneapolis, Minnesota. The New Agriculture-Horticulture Building The year 1914 witnessed the completion of the new agriculture - hortculture building, the dimensions of which are 300 feet on north, 300 on west, 366 on south and 90 on the east and is an outstanding credit to Nebraska. This building caused wonderment and delight from not only the citizens of Nebraska but from those of other states as well. The unique display furnished by a combination of those in charge and the exhibitors was something new in State Fair showing. Agri - culture, horticulture and floriculture occupied the lower floor. The display of agricultural products shown at the Nebraska State Fair are drawn from such a range of climatic conditions, owing to the various altitudes found in the state, that the exhibits are particularly instructive, providing information of such a varied character as would take months of travel to gather from local growing sources. The 36 foot balcony around a building which practically covers a city block, furnished an ideal space for Nebraska's wonderful educa - tional exhibit covering 7,149 square feet of wall space. The Better Babies exhibit and the foreign displays of agricultural products were also shown on this balcony. Better Babies The functions of the Nebraska State Fair are primarily educa - tional and must be made attractive in order to draw the pepole through our gates. In another way, people must come in order to receive the education prepared for them. The feature that is really valuable should be educational and instructive. Lincoln once said, "God must have loved the common people, He made so many of them." We have a few rich people and a few very poor people. What is termed the "common people" comprise the great middle class and upon their efforts the old world moves forward. They are the ones from whose labors the very rich and the very poor alike depend for existence. They are unique in that they accomplish suc - cess in the things of life and from their ranks come the great men of all ages. This class of people, who, because of greater numbers and more ambition, are the greater beneficiaries in the establishment of our Better Babies health contest and its teachings, will advance the health standard of our state. We have long been paying attention to the upbuilding of our animals. Can we not now add luster by devoting some thought and energy in building for a more perfect, health-abound - ing human being? </seg>
            <seg id="p024">24 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE In the west balcony of Agriculture-Horticulture building we have constructed a makeshift examination and show place for unde - veloped human beings, where, from our best medical talent, flows words of wisdom for the mother to properly care for her offspring. To enter this department for exhibition purposes, in 1914, the child must be between the ages of 18 and 36 months, and take a phy - sical examination prior to consideration for entry. We then restricted the number to a total of 200 for examination at the Fair. This number was sufficient to demand the attention of 38 physicians and a small army' of attendants, but was well worth the effort and attention in that it dealt expressly with the welfare of the human being. Boy's Camp Another department of human interest is the Boy's Camp. This department was provided with a new building for a kitchen and dining hall, which was used mornings for lectures. Great credit is due Pro - fessors Pugsley and Bradford and Secretary Luke for the interest taken, looking toward the success of this department. They were constant and untiring in service rendered freely and without hope of pecuniary reward. Such fidelity, looking only toward the welfare of the boys, deserves the highest commendation. Let the Board continue its work for the betterment of humanity until it shall at least command an equal amount of attention and pub - licity to that now devoted to the welfare of animals. State University Exhibit The State University, in the welfare of which the people of Ne - braska are deeply interested, made its first general showing at a Ne - braska State Fair, as the occupancy of the new horticultural hall made it possible for the management to set apart for their use the old hor - ticultural hall. The exhibit made was of the most important educa - tional value. The University and the people of Nebraska were brought more closely together. The splendid showing of a practical nature benefiting every-day farm problems brought many words of praise from people heretofore unacquainted with University activities. The south wing of the building was fitted up as a moving picture and lecture room and was crowded to capacity twelve times per day. The Mechanical Engineering department made practical demonstra - tions of their work in the east wing. The remainder of the building was devoted to farm crops, horticulture, weather bureau, etc. Model farm buildings with locations was an exhibit commanding attention. The best part of the exhibit was the corps of lecturers who were always found at their post imparting information relative to the differ - ent exhibits to the inquiring thousands who constantly thronged the building. We wondered how the University could fill the immense space but are now convinced they could make a better showing in a building twice the size. </seg>
            <seg id="p025">25 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Pure Food Another new innovation was the pure food show given under the auspices of Food Commissioner C. E. Harmon, which occupied the center and north three wings of the old Agricultural Hall. To the untiring energy of Mr. Harmon is due the great success of this new departure which we are pleased to mention as a show of great merit. Dairy The exhibitors of dairy products and machinery requested the use of the south three wings of old Agricultural Hall. In this new lo - cation was shown the best dairy exhibit ever seen on the State Fair grounds. Nebraska has wonderful resources for the expansion of this department and we confidently expect, at an early future date, to see this department as one of the best at the State Fair. Automobiles When a single Nebraska county has one automobile for every 24 persons within its borders, salesmen realize the importance of show - ing their wares to the farmers of Nebraska who attend the annual State Fair in greater numbers than at any other state gathering. When a building 122x430 is completely filled with the best standard manufactured automobiles it makes an imposing exhibit, and is not only a credit to the Fair but an indication of the progressiveness of the automobile dealers of the state. This progressiveness is possibly one reason that Nebraska is considered among the best fields for the showing and sale of useful machines for the elimination of distance. Machinery While the machinery exhibit of 1914 covered the ground usually assigned, still it was made up almost wholly of the smaller exhibitors. Some of the large firms cut out all State Fairs last year and Nebraska missed some of the larger exhibits which have heretofore been looked upon as a standard State Fair attraction. That the smaller exhibitors profited greatly by such conditions is a natural consequence and many expressed satisfaction at the opportunity for business presented. Amusements The free attractions used at the 1914 State Fair were, generally speaking, very satisfactory. This fact is due to the prompt carrying out of the program, especially in flights made by Lincoln Beachey, who fourteen times started on the moment Only once was he four minutes late, on account of engine trouble. This wonderful record was made irrespective of rain or wind and proved conclusively that the satisfaction given by this particular aviator is attributed to prompt - ness as well as daring. Many commendations and numerous complaints were received be- </seg>
            <seg id="p026">26 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE cause of the policy adopted by the Board in not having a carnival com - pany on the grounds. This fact, with the inadequate grandstand re - ceipts, occasioned by the rain, added f^eatly to our deficit. The speed events, which rightly come under this head and are as standard in State Fair success as the air we breathe, was greatly hampered by the muddy slow track. The horsemen are to be com - mended upon bringing their horses on such a track, whenever called upon to do so. The carrying out of the program caused a very heavy - card for the last days but, as usual, we filled our part of the program with the horsemen. Animals and Fowls The horse, cattle, sheep, swine and poultry exhibits were above the standard of such displays and were objects of much favorable comment. That Nebraska is assuming front rank in the animal breed - ing industry is evidenced by the fact that we have more horses and more cattle per capita of population than any other state, and stand second to Iowa in number of swine per capita. Breeders are beginning to realize this fact comes from our wonderful climatic and natural feeding conditions, which will eventually make Nebraska the favored animal breeding ground of the world. The poultry exhibit occupied both the old and new buildings, con - taining about 3,000 fowls. This is a department representing more value to the state of Nebraska, from a dollar standpoint, than the entire crop of spring wheat, oats, rye, barley and potatoes combined, or more than all the swine in Nebraska. Committee Farmer's Congress As per resolutions passed by the 1913 Nebraska Farmer's Con - gress, at our last meeting we appointed Mr. Charles Graff to repre - sent this Board. During the year the Committee held several meet - ings to consider recommendations. At the last meeting of the Farm - er's Congress, to-wit, December 9th, the Committee made a majority and minority report The majority report was presented by Mr. James R. Duncan and was signed by J. R. Duncan, H. C. Young, John Dal - ton, Charles Graff, L. L. Wiles, and Charley Ritchey and was in the following words and figures: "We, your committee, appointed under the resolution passed by the Farmer's Congress, report as follows: We have examined into the affairs of the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture and find that said Board as now constituted is an ab - solutely non-political organization; that the Board is made up of twenty-nine members, no two of whom are elected from the same county except Douglas and Lancaster, which have not to exceed two; the membership is elected according to the provisions of the original statute, fourteen one year and fifteen another, each holding as mem - bers of the Board a period of two years from date of election.

            <seg id="p027">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 27 the last meeting of the Board, January 20th, 1914, the representatives entitled to participate in debate or vote, were fifty-one presidents or delegates from county agricultural societies from over the state, hav - ing filed reports according to law, and twenty-seven members of the Board who were present. The nominations to supply members in place of the one-half whose membership on the Board expire at each annual meeting, was made by congressional districts. The full membership from each congressional district is five from the first, three from the second, five from the third, six from the fourth, five from the fifth, and five from the sixth. At the close of nomina - tions the names proposed are printed on an Australian ballot and the following morning the election is held. A majority of the votes of the entire body is necessary for election to membership on the Board. The officers of the Board are also elected by majority of members and dele - gates present. This method of election distributes the membership out over the state, keeping in touch with all conditions. Out of money derived from taxation the state appropriated $2,000 per annum to help pay premiums. Premiums total from $20,000 to $30,000. The state also pays for printing of an edition of 5,000 agri - cultural reports. All other money used by the Board is made out of profits from the state fair which is wholly in its charge. We find the Board's handling of Nebraska's state fair to be on a high stand - ard of excellence, the peer of any like management in the United States. The annual expenditures of the Board for premiums, labor and publicity run about $70,000. In addition to keeping up the re - pairs on the fair grounds, the total paid out for permanent improve - ments by the State Board of Agriculture from the time of the pur - chase of the permanent location in 1901 in annual sums is as follows: 1901, purchase grounds, Lincoln citizens. $ 4,300 0 ) During the same period of time the state of Nebraska has appro - priated the following amount for lands and buildings, which sums have 1901, permanent improvements 4,371.85 1902, permanent improvements 4,713.00 1902, permanent improvements 4,238.00 1904, permanent improvements 666.76 1805, permanent improvements 11,814.44 1&amp;06, permanent improvements 4,248.26 1907, permanent improvements 33,000.00 1908, permanent improvements 21,011.48 1909, permanent improvements 8,840.00 1910, permanent improvements 6,333.50 1911, permanent improvements 18,694.00 1912, permanent improvements _. .. 37,139.54 1913, permanent improvements 11,151.99 Total $170,523.52 </seg>

Under the operation of this act the scope of the work has been broadened. In 1913 the office collected and com - piled agricultural statistics, tabulated and distributed them. These statistics were inserted in 5,000 copies of the annual report for the year and an issue of 2,000 in pamphlet form of statistics alone. The work of collecting, compiling and distributing these matters of statistical data is a work of much magnitude and was done so thoroughly as to reflect credit on the department. In the matter of publicity, we find that a daily service has been established and maintained with the metropolitan press and feature stories prepared at regular intervals for the Eastern press. A weekly bulletin is prepared, printed and sent to the country press each week. From the records of the Board we find expenditures fully set forth and published in each report, and we wish to especially com - mend the management on the businesslike methods of handling its money expenditures for the great good done the public with the funds handled. We think that the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture has handled the financial end in such a manner that all of the taxpayers money expended through legislative enactment for farmers' institute*, and development in agriculture other than experiments, and schools would produce the best results if handled in a businesslike manner such as is common to the management of this Board's activities. This Board has secured permission to send all its bulletins as second class matter through the mails. The state would save consid - erable in the line of postage to have a number of its departments con - solidated under the State Board of Agriculture in conformity with the National Board at Washington. After careful study of laws and results under which other states operate, and owing to the businesslike management of the affairs of the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture, we believe it for the best interests of the taxpayers to continue the present law without change, except for the following recommendations as made by the sub-corn- .901, purchase of grounds _ J35.000.00 903, ladies comfort building 3,000.00 .905, live stock building 10,000.00 L907, cattle barn - 20,000.00 .909, coliseum 50,000.00 ,911, grand stand 15,000.00 L913, agricultural-horticultural building 100,000.00 L913, land, 60 acres 8,000.00 Total $241,000.00 ..$241,000.0( </seg>

We further recommended that each county agricultural society organ - ized under the statutes of the state shall have a vice-president from each township or precinct who shall be elected at the annual meeting. The minority report was presented by Mr. J. H. Amsberry and was signed by J. D. Ream, C. H. Gustafson, Arthur Schulz and J. M. Amsberry, made the following recommendations: "We, the undersigned members of the committee appointed by your respective bodies to inquire into and report upon the advisability of the reorganization of the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture, would report as follows: Our inquiry has brought out the following: First — That the statutory provisions providing that "the deliber - ating and consulting as to the wants, prospects and conditions of the agricultural interests throughout the state" is not being, and has not been complied with by the Board. Second — That the work of the present Board of Agriculture deals almost exclusively with the holding of a state fair, wherein the ex - hibition of the agricultural products and live stock of the state and the entertainment of the people are important features, but it does not delve deeply into the intricate problems of the needs, requirements and methods of agricultural and live stock, production, development and improvement, as would seem to be the intent of the law above quoted; that it is an exhibitor of the products of the varied resources of the state, but is not a direct potent factor in the development of such resources. Third-^That the prsent State Board of Agriculture is not and has never been, truly representative of the whole state. Its records will show that less than one-half of the counties of the state have been represented at the annual meetings of the Board during the last twenty years. The provisions for representation of counties requires that a county in order to secure a certain amount of money, offer prem - iums and make report of such proceedings to the state board. This method of securing county members is especially well adapted for securing a state fair board eminently qualified to successfully manage a state fair, but we question it being especially suitable for securing a. State Board of Agriculture especially qualified and deeply interested in the work outlined in the section of the law above quoted. Therefore, we would recommend that the present title be changed </seg>
            <seg id="p030">30 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE to the "State Fair Board" or "association," which would be more nearly in line with the work performed, thus leaving the field open for a state board of agriculture, which, if ever occupied, should be along the lines suggested by the section of law above quoted." After a discussion of nearly two hours in which Joseph Roberts, W. R. Mellor, J. F. McArdle, Charles Graff, J. H. Agee and James Walsh spoke for the majority report, and C. H. Gustafson and T. !•'. Sturgess for the minority, on motion of Mr. Charles Wooster both re - ports were laid on the table. Annual Meeting American Fairs and Expositions The annual meeting of the American Association of Fairs and Expositions was held in Chicago at the Auditorium Hotel, December 3rd and 4th, 1914. Those in attendance from this organization were Joseph Roberts, J. A. Ollis, William Foster, Charles Graff, Hiram Myers and your Secretary. Nebraska was honored by the election of President of the American Association of Fairs and Expositions from among our number. Thirty-three state associations were represented. The dates secured for our next State Fair are September 6-10, 1915. Bill for Swine Barn According to a partial promise made to the swine breeders of Nebraska, we have prepared for introduction a bill from the passage of which by the legislature we hope to build a permanent steel, con - crete and metal pen swine barn on the high land just north of the Seventeenth street entrance and east of the Burlington and street car tracks on the grounds. The draft of the bill is as follows: A BILL FOR AN ACT authorizing the grading of land and the construction on the state fair grounds of a permanent building, and to appro - priate for such purpose the sum of Eighty Thousand Dollars ($80,000.00), or as much thereof as may be necessary. Be It Enacted by the People of the State of Nebraska: Section 1. (State fair grounds, buildings, plans.) Immediately after the taking effect of this act, the State Board of Agriculture shall cause to be prepared and presented to the Board of Educational Lands and Funds, plans and specifications for one steel, brick and concrete swine barn at an estimated cost for construction of the same and grad - ing upon the grounds, not to exceed Eighty Thousand Dollars ($80, - 000.00), to be placed on the state fair grounds, and to be built of permanent and substantial material. Section 2. (Buildings, construction.) If, in the judgment of the said Board of Educational Lands and Funds, the said plans and speci- </seg>

When - ever deemed necessary by said Board of Educational Lands and Funds, a superintendent of construction shall be appointed and his compensa - tion, together with all necessary expense, shall be paid out of the appropriation herein made. The said permanent swine barn shall be of such a character and located on such a part of said state fair grounds as said State Board of Agriculture may approved and direct. Section 3. (Appropriation.) For the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of this act, there is hereby appropriated out of any money in the state treasury not otherwise appropriated the sum of eighty thousand dollars ($80,000.00) or as much thereof as may be necessary. The Board of Educational Lands and Funds shall approve all claims, and the auditor is hereby directed to audit such claims and draw his warrant on the state treasurer for the amount thereof. Nebraska's Crop Production In round numbers our estimate of the production of 1914 on a basis of December 1st, is $432,000,000. This sum, almost beyond com - prehension, came from Nebraska's fertile soil at a minimum of labor and expense. At the very threshold of the world's markets the farmer of this state enjoys privileges and encounters opportunities impossible to find elsewhere. When the foreign war caused a commotion among the fertilizer manufacturers, Nebraska farmers felt no alarm. Indeed one Eastern house wired the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture, propounding the alarming query: "Where will your farmers secure their fertilizers this year?" The reply may have been disappointing, but doubtless it was in - structive to the Easterner. Nebraska can secure all the fertilizers nec - essary to rebuild her loess soils by ordinary conservation of straw - stacks and barnyard manure. Add to these scientific alfalfa and crop rotation and there is nothing to fear for ages to come. Nebraska has 37,000,000 acres of loess soil, the richest in the world. Then the poorer soils of this exceptionally favored state compare remarkably well with the best offered by advocates of sections now being eagerly and noisily promoted. Below we give a summary of the items which compose the grand total of the record for agricultural production in 1914: </seg>
            <seg id="p032">32 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Eggs and poultry 36,000,000 Owing to the varying size of Nebraska counties and the difference in population, an accurate grouping of counties in respect to their re - sources is not possible.

            <seg id="p034">34 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The best average yield per acre was reported on leading crops from counties as follows: Corn, Douglas; wheat, Hall; oats, Scott's BluiT; alfalfa, Sioux; hay, Burt and Frontier. The figures included in this estimate are conservative. As com- pared with other reports, their accuracy can be demonstrated to practical farmer. For instance, the 8 per cent decrease noted in corn acreage, as compared with the 1913 crop, will be found extrem accurate. In this instance the sources of information which formed I basis for the estimate of the board of agriculture were perfectly liable. Percentage estimates varied widely and failed to take count the drouth of 1913 which caused a decreas n a and stimulated the sowing of wheat. It is easy to indulge in hyperbole and similes, but the hard headed man wants facts. Figures convince him. Just now are suffering from the effects of the work of irresponsible he chants. Immigration lured to the state by ficti permanent prosperity to a community. Accuracy and j in compiling figures should be the ideal of those engaged or publicity work. In Nebraska it has been necessary to eliminate a few kinks. Ev with us, city farmers have done some figuring. That explains why 1914 the time-honored price of $12.50 a ton for alfalfa no longer mai tains. After careful investigation, it was found that a p is more nearly what the Nebraska farmer receives. This pr taken as the basis for the valuation of the 1914 crop. Sev ago an unreasonable value was accredited to the apple estimating discredited and handicapped this impor order to promote the welfare of Nebraska a candid stat is all that is needed. Word painting and imagery have been overworked tions of the country by unscrupulous promoters. The b ceived numerous and insistent calls for tabulated statements of Ne - braska's resources with the rhetorical front left out. This demand the board has supplied with crop reports issued in 1913 and 1914. In the latter report an effort was made to ascertain the price received by the farmer. As an example of the results obtained the corn table in the 1914 report may be cited. The average price in each county of the state was ascertained, all the crop correspondents reporting the price paid in their localities on a given date. The method of collecting the Nebraska crcp statistics is similar to the system followed in the most progressive states in the union. The assessor reports the acreages and takes the census of animals, fowls, production, laborers, owners of farms, tenants and other con - ditions of rural life. This is supplemented by crop reporters in every section of the state. These indicate the condition of the crops at fre - quent intervals during the growing season. They also send in esti - mates on yields and from their reports the county averages are coin- </seg>
            <seg id="p035">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 35 piled. In 1914 the blanks furnished the assessors contained more than a hundred queries. It would be better to reduce the number of ques - tions and omit from the list all items furnished the auditor or other departments of state. In this way the work of the assessor would be lightened and better results secured. As to methods of improving the system of collecting statistics your secretary is much in doubt. The best data within and without the state has been secured. The writings and speeches of critics have been given careful consideration in the hope that improvements would be suggested. These criticisms have ranged all the way from the as - sertion that crop reporting injures the farmer to elaborate systems of estimating too expensive to be introduced by this Board in this state. However, the farmer should be encouraged to keep accounts, inform himself of all the details of farm production, and frankly re - port conditions to the assessor. Commercial clubs and boosters' or - ganizations should survey the tabulations made by the county clerks insist on a true portrayal of the resources of the community. In his way the assessor will receive assistance and encouragement. Too ften the assessor is the recipient of kicks, complaints and harsh criti- cism. Better results will be secured each year if the assessor first secures the farmer's confidence and next receives support of the or - ganized body in correctly reporting the agricultural wealth of his mmumty. Publicity The scope of the publicity work has greatly broadened during 1914. About 100,000 pieces of mail, practically 2,000 a week, have been sent out. Primarily, this department advertises the resources of the state. This duty, laid upon the state board of agriculture by the Scott act, has been faithfully discharged. In addition every form of publicity which aids in the development of the state has been given attention. The meetings of Organized Agriculture are advertised each year by the publicity department. All the movements for the betterment of the condition of the rural communities receive attention. During the last year, the state board of agriculture, at its own expense, has ex - tended assistance to the live stock associations, the state veterinarian, and the farm demonstrators of the state. Agricultural extension, Bet - ter Babies, the State Fair, Rural Education, the County Fairs, Horti - culture, alfalfa seed and potato industry, good roads, freight rates, marketing, distribution, household economics and kindred subjects have been given attention. News stories are furnished for the metropolitan press each day. Weekly bulletins are sent to the country papers and to the press asso - ciations. The department works in harmony with the other agencies for the dissemination of information to the farmers, leaving the tech - nical side of agriculture to the Extension News Service at the Uni - versity Farm. </seg>
            <seg id="p036">36 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Under a recent act of Congress, the publicity department of the state board of agriculture enjoys the privilege of the second class rate. Postage is 1 cent a pound anywhere in the United States or its terri - tories. The 1914 crop reports were circulated at a minimum of ex - pense, with no charge for cartage and with a system of economy that no private enterprise can equal. In one mailing of the crop bulletins fifteen hundred volumes were distributed at an expense of slightly more than $5.00 for postage. An edition of 20,000 of the statistical reports of the state board of Agriculture could be handled at slight expense. These pamphlets, if placed in the hands of prospective home - seekers, would immeasurably strengthen the state's advertising cam - paign. Under the system of the state board of agriculture, the saving in postage alone equals the salary usually paid to the head of a statis - tical department. Kindred reports of the state departments, of great interest to the farmers of Nebraska, could also be mailed out by the board of agriculture at a tremendous saving in postage to the tax - payers. Hundreds of columns of matter are printed each week in daily, weekly and monthly periodicals. Some of the bulletins of the state board of agriculture have been printed throughout the East. Articles have also been "worked over" and greatly embellished by enterprising Sunday editors of the Eastern cities. A compilation of the articles printed is impossible, as it would take the time of an additional clerk to do this work and keep the scrap book up-to-date. Your secretary wishes to emphasize the value of the gratuitous publicity given by the daily and weekly papers of Nebraska. In ex - ploiting the opportunities and resources of Nebraska the newspaper men of the state have been both loyal and generous. One of the sur - prising features is the value of the space of rural newspapers some - times regarded as obscure. Publications in the mediums of limited circulation have produced visible results, while "stories" appearing in much lauded magazines and periodicals with millions of readers have resulted only in replies from curiosity seekers. The very nature of those inquiries marks the writers, in many cases, as undesirables. Should they be induced to come to the state they would ultimately add to the burdens of the successful farmers in the community so unfor - tunate as to attract them. The whole aim of our publicity should be to advance the inter - ests and happiness of our people. With this end in view, it seems that the cornerstone of our advertising campaign should be laid at home. The successful Nebraska farmer should be encouraged to extend his operations in the community where he has been prosperous and happy. Next, his sons and daughters should be kept within our bord - ers. These will succeed. The next class of desirables are people from abroad. During the next few years many of these may be aliens, wholly unacquainted with our ideals of life and methods of farming. All these immigrants from without the state must study the Nebraska soil. </seg>
            <seg id="p037">37 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE become familiar with Nebraska methods of farming and learn many things that are new to them. These people may succeed. On the theory outlined above the publicity work of this board has been directed. That it is not the most spectacular policy is admitted. But it secures results and will never bring to the state unenviable notoriety. Nebraska needs but a graphic and truthful portrayal of her resources to attract within her borders hundreds of enlightened and determined workers. Such results can be secured by extending the scope of the publicity work along the lines indicated. Request for $6,000 from state.

The motion was amended and we voted on the amendment but I do not believe we took a vote on the motion as amended. President Roberts: No we did not but Mr. Mann accepted the amendment. McKelvie: That is all right I merely spoke of it so our records would be complete on the matter . Prsident Roberts: What is your further pleasure gentlemen?

The Secretary called the roll and reported a majority present. President Roberts: The first thing this morning we will hear from the Credential Committee, if they have any more delegates to add to their report.

President Roberts: I presume likely, gentlemen, you all know of the big banquet tonight where the different organizations meet in one grc«t body at the Lindell hotel. The parties in charge of the banquet are anxious to know how many will attend from this association and I would like very much to have those who wish to attend advise us so we can we car advise them as to how many will go. Secretary Mellor: Are there any of you who will bring ladies After a count twenty-five signified their intention of being present President Roberts: We will now hear the report of the revision committee. Ollis: Those of you who have premioum lists follow along as we call the pages so as to get the sense of the report. You realize it will be almost impossible to make anything out of the report without com - paring it with the premium list. Secretary Mellor: Mr. President yesterday I received a telephone message from Mr. J. H. Taylor of Waterloo, who is a member of the State Board of Agriculture, saying that on account of sickness he is unable to come. I move therefore, that he be excused from the meeting. Seconded and carried unanimously. Ollis: I think probably it would be well to read the report clear through and then you can adopt it as a whole or go back and adopt it item by item as you see fit. If any of you want to look up anything in the premium list and I go too fast, if you will just say so we will hold up a little and give you time. </seg>

A few minor changes have been suggested and we recommend that they be left to the incoming, board for correction. Therefore your Commiteee feel that it is not advisable enl as much of our funds for publicity work as we have done in the past and we would recommend that this work be cut down to not exceed one thousand dollars a year. We further recommend retrenchment alone: expenses as far as practical. J. A. OLLIS Chairman WM. JAMES V. ARNOLD E. R. DANIELSON L. W. LEONARD Ollis: I move the adoption of Motion seconded. the report Roberts: You have heard the report of the revision committee, are there any remarks? </seg>
            <seg id="p107">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 107 Mellor: Mr. President, we have asked the legislature for (3,000.00 a year to assist in this publicity and statistical work. The Scott act of two years ago makes it necessary for our office to gather this work and if this last recommendation obtains, it is going to remodel the work of the office practically. I think it should not obtain, I think that matter should be left to the Board of Managers until the legisla - ture is through to see whether it is desirable or not at that time, and another thing I wish to recommend ,and I move, Mr. President, to amend the report of the revision committee by striking out all of that part of the pay roll schedule on page 13 of the book where the pay amounts to more than three dollars per day and all reading matter at foot of said page, and next to the last line of section 10 and rut out the last paragraph of section 11, page 19, and amend in each case to read $4.00 per day and ten cents mileage one way from which all expenses are to be paid. Youngers: I second the motion. Mellor: I will tell you why, all the people who occupy these po - sitions are not dependent on this state board of agriculture for their living. They are doing this work, as they claim, for the benefit of the state of Nebraska. The state of Iowa pays $4.00 per day to all of their managers and the sum of ten cents per mile one way and out of that they pay their expenses, therefore I think Nebraska should be just as progressive, if they are going to start to be progressive, as Iowa. I feel this way about it, a great deal of the work for the success of the fair depends on the office and I do not care like to have the office handi - capped by stating it shall be cut down to a condition where we cannot have competent help, that is, less than some stenographers in many of the offices in the state house get and you cannot get a competent man, capable of doing that work, for any such sum of money. As far as myself is concerned I have never been a stickler for money, you know that, I devote all of my time to this work and have had offers that would pay me twice as much money as you are offering me, I have had sev - eral of them. I believe I could go out to another state next week at a good deal of an advance. It is not necessary for me to consider that part of it but I believe these men who want to do something for the state of Nebraska, now that our funds are so low, can have the oppor - tunity this year and I hope you people will give this your consideration. Roberts: Are there any more remarks? Danielson: I would like to ask Mr. Mellor if he means on page 13, in the schedule, make this read $3.00 per day? Mellor: $4.00, cut out all above $3.00 per day Danielson: You simply give the superintendents a dollar a day more than the clerks? Mellor: Yes, you people are working for glory, anyway. Danielson: Cut out railroad fare and hotel and give 10 cents per mile? </seg>
            <seg id="p108">108 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Mellor: I will make my motion read 10 cents per mile each way It can be done with the consent of the second. Roberts: Done with the consent of the second? Seconded. Roberts: Are there any more remarks? VonForell: I want to speak in regard to the publicity department because the legislature said it should be done. I believe Mr. Mellor - motion is to the point and disseminating this knowledge of what the board is doing and giving it to the people over the state is essential and I do not believe the head office, the office that is really doing the work should be handicapped in any way even if a deficit should be the result as we over the state certainly want to know what the resources of the state are and if there is any benefit to anyone anywhere in the state, to be received from this I believe the state board of agriculture should give it and through its influence we should become acquainted with the resources and I therefore heartily approve of Mr. Mellor's motion. Ollis: I just want to say this to put the committee right on this publicity work proposition. The committee was unanimously of the opinion that if the state requires this publicity work to be done and also reserves the right to name the publicity man which they do, prac - tically, saying the governor and the secretary of the state board of agriculture shall select the publicity man and we know that when the governor has a hand in anything it is left up to him to do it, they should not require the state board of agriculture to pay out money when they have not got it and go and give their personal note to carry on the work until the next fall. If they run into another week of bad weather it would probably be conntinued for another year or two. It was not the idea of the committee at all, if the state appropriates any money to carry on the work but at the present time; if the state does not appropriate the money the state board of agriculture has to put up the money the committee felt there could be quite a little bit of pub - licity work done by securing a good man stenographer they could get for one thousand dollars and under the direction of the secretary a great deal of publicity work could be done and under the circumstance.* it would make a very good make-shift anyway but if the state appropri - ates money to carry on the work of course that money would be ex - pended to carry the work on .nobody is trying to interfere with that. Von Forell : I want to ask for some information and probably the rest would like to know it, too, the state requires a publicity man, is not that the case? Mellor: Shall I answer that? This law was drawn that the gov - ernor of the state of Nebraska and the secretary of the state board of agriculture should appoint and discharge employees. The reason it was drawn this way is that the state of Nebraska is in the habit of fluctuat - ing from one party to another and if you get a man versed in the work and a new governor comes in he spoils all the work by firing him and putting a new man in his place. That is the reason the sec- </seg>
            <seg id="p109">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 109 rotary of the state board of agriculture was added so no man could be fired unless this board desires him fired, that is a good safeguard for competency. If we fail to get out our bulletins each week we lose our one cent a pound rate of postage for sending these out of our office. I cannot do all of the work, it is too big a thing for me to do. I do not want you to think for a minute I want to shirk it, I have been pretty constant on the job and have done the best I could for the state board of agriculture and if this secretary's office is responsible for the welfare of this board, which I think most of you think it is, we have to carry out the business end of it in a way that will produce results and 1 think in the nine years I have been secretary there have been results ac - complished; I think you will agree to that. If you are going to handicap my office, go ahead and do it, I do not have to do any more than I want to. If there was just a state fair I could get off four or five months a year, but if you have to run a state board of agriculture as we have been running it, you have to stay on the job. Von Forell: If the state requires this work they will make an appropriation for it. Mellor: This act was passed at the request of some of our mem- bers Von Forell: The state will make an appropriation. Mellor: We have asked for it, they did not make it two years ago Danielson: Was there not a four or five thousand dollar appro - priation went with this bill, and stricken out finally? Ollis: As the bill was first introduced did it not carry an appro - priation ? Mellor: Not as carried in the house. Ollis: As introduced in the house it carried an appropriation, and the same committee whatever it was before or the committee of the whole turned the whole thing down. Mellor: The original bill carried ten thousand dollars. Ollis: If the state board shows the legislature we are going to do it anyway, there will be no appropriation made. It will only be two or three months until we have funds and if they find out the board will pay it they will let them do it McArdle: I believe the question before the house is to strike out, on page 13, all above three dollars to read $4.00 and ten cents per mile each way; is that the question before the house? That is the question I would like to talk on. I do not believe the superintendents are get - ting any too much money. Secretary Mellor: I don't either, John. McArdle: And I don't believe it is judicious; I do not believe Mr. Mellor's amendment is well taken to cut those men to $4.00. I don't believe there is a superintendent doing business on the fair grounds but who is more than a $4.00 a day man. They are all state fair men, and that is all they get out of it and I am sure Mr. Mellor and anyone </seg>
            <seg id="p110">110 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE else closely identified with them know these men have filled their po - sitions well and are a strong part of the fair. They are necessary and I do not believe we could class them with ordinary hired men. I am not going to speak on any other phase of the committee's recommenda - tion but on this I am, and I hope you will vote, with all due respect to our secretary, vote his amendment down and not cut these super - intendents to $4.00 per day. I have always been a stickler for them, they are not getting enough as it is for the time they come. Mellor says they are working for glory and that is all right in the abstract, no man is working for glory — there must be a little besides. I suppose that all of us realize that, who have been connected with the state and county fairs in the past. There must be an incentive, with a little bit of money. Four dollars per day and mileage is hardly sufficient. There is a difference in that list, some positions call for $60.00 and some $30.00 and I believe it is well regulated. It is the positions they hold. The position of superintendent is different and the blanket amendment cuts all to $4.00. It is not fair to thoes positions, some are very important. Some positions require two or three months' work before, for which they do not receive any money. Other positions do not require anything further than coming Monday morning and going Friday afternoon. Mr. Mellor's motion cuts all to $4.00 per day. I think we would be a penny wise and pound foolish to change this list, as already made relating to the superintendents and I hope you will vote it down. Leftwich: We want to be consistent to the people of the state Mr. Mellor's motion makes a mileage of ten cents per mile. Secretary Mellor: I will make it ten cents per mile each way, if you prefer. Leftwich: That makes it twenty cents per mile when people know that we have always been receiving our actual railroad fare which is two cents per mile. Secretary Mellor: But you have been getting your hotel bills in addition. Leftwich: In addition to that, why not make it as it is, our rail - road fare and hotel bills. I doubt very much if there is a superinten - dent who has ever presided at this fair that has ever gotten much more than his expense during the time he has been here. To make twenty cents per mile to go and come, people know it does not cost us that. Let us put it where it belongs, two cents per mile is what we pay the railroad; let us put it two cents per mile. Secretary Mellor: Your point is well taken. If my second will con - sent, will say actual fare and hotel bill. Mr. Youngers consented. Gustafson: Let us do this thing right now gentlemen, under this proposition by our secretary, Mr. Mellor, the superintendent that lives in the western part of the state would get twenty cents per mile, you </seg>
            <seg id="p111">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 111 see what a sum he would draw and then $4.00 per day when he gets here. President Roberts: Pardon me just a moment please, that ques - tion is taken back, of twenty cents per mile. Gustafson: I just wanted to show the injustice that would be to the people who live close to Lincoln. Von Forell : I seconded the motion and I was willing to with - draw when I found I was getting more than any other superintendent, being from the western part of the ' state. Walsh: My remarks will be brief. I was physically unable to compete with educational and prepared speeches which were read to the public. A farmer to get up and talk from his plain standpoint on agriculture and its possibilities against the education of the state of Nebraska, I thought the wisest thing I could do was to skiddoo. But to the speech, we are up against a problem that must be solved intel - ligently. There has been a committee at work, men who are interested in the state of Nebraska, to revise the conditions of the state fair, its management and its premium list. That committee has given due con - sideration to all phases. We are in debt and if Providence will only forecast what would be the result another year, we might carry that in - debtedness at some six or seven per cent and then go into it deeper. Retrenchment is the order of the day from Washington down to the sand hills of Nebraska and it will do me good to go back to my home and say that every man here has looked at this question from a business standpoint, and I am here to vote and support the findings of that committee without any change. They have given their attention to their work while we have been bumming around looking for something easy, they have been laboring hard and this is the result of their find - ing, so I hope the amendment will be voted down. President Roberts: Anyone else who wants to talk on this ques- ti Purcell: I think this is the time when, owing to the financial con - dition of the society, we will have to look well to the future. I do not think any of our members here want to handicap the work to any greater extent than is absolutely necessary. I do feel we should all do our part. I feel that if, in the course of events, the Board of Managers find that any further retrenchment is necessary should the report carry as it is, I think they are big enough and broad enough to do that. I favor the report of the committee as it is, I believe they have given it deep consideration and no doubt have given it a great deal of time and in their wisdom they have done at least what they believe should be done. I favor the report of the committee as the committee has given it to us. Rudge: I think the amended motion as made by Mr. Mellor perhaps ought to be divided in some say, some parts of that amendment I am very much in favor of and if we divide it and make it in separate mo- </seg>
            <seg id="p112">112 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BUAJtD OF AGRICULTURE tions I believe we could discuss it more intelligently than we can as a whole proposition. President Roberts: Would it not be well to have Mr. Mellor read the amendment over; there have been some changes since it was made. let him read it as it now is. Leftwich: Read it slowly so we can get on to it. Secretary Mellor: I move to amend the report of the revision committee by striking out all that part of the pay roll schedule on page 13 where the pay amounts to more than $3.00 per day and all reading matter on foot of said page, to amend next to last line on page 16 in next to last line of section 10 and cut out last paragraph in section 11. page 19, and amend in each case to read $4.00 per day and actual railroad fare and hotel bill. These superintendents on this pay roll are all members of the Board, I take it that if you are public spirited and want to assist the state board of agriculture that you will be willing to come down here and work a few days, you have to work on this business for $4.00 per day and hotel and railroad fare. You are not dependent on this particular job for your living, you are doing some - thing else, your time is devoted to something else and I believe if you want to show your public spiritedness it is a good thing to show it in that way. I know you are not paid for it. none of you are getting the money you should, it is just a matter of tiding over the State Board of Agriculture in its hour of necessity. When Youngers and I came on this Board, at the first meeting we attended we had to put our names to a five thousand dollar note that day; that is nothing, we can do it again. I think if you are public spirited enough you will do this much this year and see if we get out of the hole. Riesen: You did not discuss the amount of the hotel bill; if remain the same as it is here. Secretary Mellor: I did not say what it should be. President Roberts: I think you all understand the amendment to the committee report; if so we will vote on the amendment. Are you ready for the question. Question. President Roberts: All in favor of the motion as amended will manifest it by saying aye. Contrary no. Those favoring it will stand. The vote was 27 in favor; 19 opposed. President Roberts: The motion prevails. We will now vote on the original. Secretary Mellor: I wish to make another amendment, that the last clause be stricken out and left to the Board of Managers. If this legislature passes the appropriation bill then we can strike out that part, in fact we won't pay any of it, the state can pay it then. That is the way we have it lined up, if we get the money. A member: I second it Danielson: When we took that under consideration we figured it this way. If the legislature was asked for an appropriation for this </seg>
            <seg id="p113">PROCEEDING; NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 113 publicity bureau we left that thousand dollars in there, you can use that in two months or three months and if they come on with this appropriation we figured it would have no effect on it whatever. Secretary Mellor: You do not understand the situation. The man have in the publicity department has been offered six or seven hun- iollars more than we are paying him. That means a handicap. Walsh: I see there is another amendment offered by Mr. Mellor; not satisfied with carrying an amendment to satisfy the most exacting. If you do not vote that amendment down so long as this Board goes on record, the legislature will not appropriate one dollar. Secretary Mellor: This man has been for nine years city editor the Star Walsh: He had better stayed with the Star. No matter what he las been, this is state work and the state pays for it. The present louse is not a house to pay one dollar it can get along without. Unless you pass the resolution by the revision committee that the office will lave to be paid for by the state, it will be the same thing over again, [he state board will have to dig down and pay $1800.00 a year at the ;tate board's expense. Leftwich: It seems to me that if the state as a legislature has created an office or establishment of any kind they should not lay down on paying the expenses of it. It seems to me as if this publicity matter should be up to the state and not up to the state board of agriculture; we have troubles of our own and there is no question but what we should leave this to the legislature to make an appropriation; they have a way by which they can do it. Von Forell: I want to call attention to some things the state have created from time to time for which they did not pay. I remem - ber a number of years ago the state created an office of entomology and made Professor Bruner the entomologist and after a while they began to swear over the line at us because we did not look after the insect plague and Professor Bruner did not have a dollar to pay postage unless he took it out of his own pocket unless the University made an appropriation, which the University did not have the right to do. It was just as true in the creation of the State Veterinarian's office; at rirst it was saddled on the University and the thing was left undone. Unless the regents, contrary to law. were willing to make an appro - priation for the state veterinarian, which they had no right to do. We have the same proposition here, they have saddled upon the State Board of Agriculture this publicity bureau and made no appropriation and I fear unless the State Board of Agriculture somehow makes an appropriation for this I fear the legislature may or may not. We are in this dilemma, that if we cannot get them to make an appropriation the State Board of Agriculture will have to do it, or leave it undone. A peculiar position, unless we can persuade the state to make an appropriation for these institutions they created and I believe if we will go together we can persuade the legislature to make an appro- </seg>

This is in part under the direction of the State Board of Agriculture but I want to tell you we will never get the appropriation unless we go after it. I remember I said once to Mr. Bruner, "We want to get an appropriation of three thousand dollars at least so we can get this information out to the state and make some experiments in regard to these insects that are causing destruction." Kansas was furnishing us men while other men were swearing at us over the 'phone. I was president at Kearney and said, "Next winter I am going down to the legislature and see if I cannot interest these western farmers for an appropriation in Bruner's department." I went to the west end of the state and they declared they did not know there was such a thing as a state entomologist, a chinch bug or an insect plague. I could not interest them at all but these western representa - tives would stand up and make an eloquent address on the fire and police regulations of Omaha. If we want anything we have got to go after it. The State Board of Agriculture should go to the legislature and say, "You have created a child, it is a legitimate birth but are trying 1 to feed it on charity and hand-outs." I believe if we do, they will give us the appropriation. I believe we ought to attend to this publicity matter as if we expected it. We should not retrench on that particular point but we will have to carry on a campaign. Mitchell: I believe our duty here is to stand by our secretary and not hamper him and cause him to have his office plans disarranged; I believe we should support him in his remarks for the amendment and go after this appropriation. The thing to do right now is to stand by our secretary and not cause any confusion in his office. I favor the amendment. President Roberts: I presume you all understand the amendment as made by the secretary, if not I will have him state it again. Amendment again read by Mr. Mellor. President Roberts: Those in favor manifest it by sayinp aye. con - trary no. I think the ayes have it but will ask you to rise. I want this square.

President Roberts: 1 would like to suggest, gentlemen, that if you have any resolutions of any length that you prepare them in writ - ing and present them to the desk; by so doing it will help me and help our stenographers. We would like to have a report of the committee on the revisior of the districts. Leonard: This is one of the longest reports that has ever be* handed in, the committee recommends no change. </seg>
            <seg id="p115">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 115 Mitchell: I move the report be adopted and the committee dig charged. Seconded and carried unanimously. Von Forell: I want to say a few words anyway. I think this re - port should be rejected. Anyway I am disappointed for the people of my district; I thought, when I made the motion yesterday to refer this to a committee that this was the time and place to look afer this matter. I am disappointed in this, while I do not want any strife in - jected anywhere that might enter into a long drawn out discussion or debate with any feeling at all, I do believe that the 6th congressional district does not get a square deal in this matter. It was the sense yesterday of two-thirds of the people present to correct this thing that was wrong. Some of the members of the committee told me that other things might have been injected which would cause a long drawn out discussion or debate. I want to call your attention to two things: I was talking to members of the fourth congressional district, they said that if this matter was corrected they were willing for it. I do not believe there is a man in the fourth who would not favor it and it seems to me when we see the fourth congressional district with 38,000 having six members and the sixth with 50,000 having five, it is hardly a square deal. It does not look right to me, it does not look right to you — I know I voted in favor of the amendment for actual railroad fare and $4.00 in the face of the fact that I was a superintendent from the western part of the state for several years. I heartily concurred in it because it was not a question of a few dollars with me for it costs me more each year than I get out of it, in order to get our people stirred up. I have burned more in gasoline in trying to help collect exhibits to bring from our county down here. We meet here at the time of the annual stock show in Denver, I got one member of the county board to come here. He said "I will stay here for the first day or so and then I have to go back, I want to go to the Denver Stock Show." We stayed the same room at the hotel and when it came time for him to go he could not find the key. I had drop &gt;od my hat on it and I was so con - fused I could not find it either so he was too late for the train and he stayed two days longer because of it. I want to tell you fellows we are battling hard out there and it seems to me we should equalize this with the fourth district. I am interested in this matter, I believe our state fair should grow, it is worth our while and I believe we should have representation commensurate with the population at least. If memb?r and the fourth one less they still would have the advantage so far as the population and congressional vote is 'con - cerned. I therefore move now that this correction be made without regard to any other part, that one member be taken from the fourth and added to the sixth. It is only fair play. A member: I second the motion. Gustafson: On behalf of the fourth I want to ask this, why they pick out the fourth, the first has the long end of it. </seg>
            <seg id="p116">116 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE President Roberts: I want to say, gentlemen, as long as Mr. Yon Forell has talked on this question after the vote was taken it would be nothing more than right to give some member of that committee a chance to explain why they reached this conclusion. Walsh: We have a grievance in the second district: with a popu - lation of 250,000 inhabitants we have three representatives. If we open this up for debate the second district will be in line and ask that we be properly represented. In the interest of harmony we do not want to open up this fight but we have some of the best exhibitors in the state clamoring for recognition on this Board but we said, in the interest of harmony, this was no time to create friction and will vote for no change but if there is going to be a change the second will be in line and ask for justice. I cast my vote for no change. Rudge: I think the motion as made by Mr. Von Forell was out of order; the whole matter had been settled and the only may we could bring it up again would be to reconsider the previous motion. McArdle: The chairman has announced the vote and the only we could discuss it is to raise it from the table. President Roberts: I recognized Mr. Von Forell out realized he was talking on a question that was settled and I believ now the only way to talk on this question at all is to reconsider it. a Mr. Rudge has stated. Von Forell: I seriously take issue with Mr. Rudge. With all due regard to his judgment on this matter, the question I raised was not the question for which this committee was appointed. This committee was appointed to re-adjust upon an equitable basis of representation. Now then my motion was a different motion dealing only with one particular question which was absolutely different and is not related to that ques - tion and how you can rule it as being out of order is more than I can see, under Parliamentary usages, but I want to say this, that I am wil - ling, in order to have harmony and peace, to withdraw that motion, or. if you wish to sustain the point, that is all right. I do not want to create any confusion. When the question was raised I merely put it on this basis of representation between the two districts. President Roberts: You have just made one motion, that is a&gt; clear as could be, and that was disposed of by the appointment of a committee. Von Forell: Charley Mann made a motion, between the two I made a motion that representation in all the districts be made upon the basis of their congressional vote. It was not the motion made it was a dif - ferent proposition. A member: Mr. Mann withdrew his original motion and the motior acted on was Von Forell's motion. I think the records if you wil look at them, will state the object of that committe was to make &lt; re-appointment of these districts and they have come in with a report Kokjer: I make a motion that a committee of one from each dis </seg>
            <seg id="p117">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 117 trict be appointed at this time to report at the next annual meeting, as to the re-appointment of the districts. Graff: Is there a motion before the house? President Roberts: No sir, nothing before the house. Was your motion seconded, Mr. Kokjer? A member: Von Forell seconded it President Roberts: I will have to sustain the point of order by Mr. Rudge, to raise the question again you will have to reconsider it. A member: Inasmuch as you are holding your point good, I move to reconsider the motion. Seconded. President Roberts: It is moved to reconsider the action of that committee. Are there any remarks? Cook: It seems to me not one district but several districts are disappointed since they brought up this matter. I just got up for a little information. I think maybe to get this before the house, it might be satisfactory to everyone to re-district the state of Nebraska accord - ing to population, to make it so everyone got a little more and make it more satisfactory than it is at the present time. Graff: want to say, gentlemen, as a member of that committee, if you re-open this matter at this time you are undertaking a big 'ob and I feel confident that the result of the report of such a committee would be just about what the report of this committee has been. I have known Von Forell for a number of years, I have always considered him as a pretty square sort of a fellow but here he comes before this body and demands fairness and justice and in trying to obtain that he tells us of a dirty, underhanded trick he played on one of his friends here. You will not be able to make any change at this time. I do not believe any of the members of this committee think any different. If you are going to open up this matter at this time I hear my friend Walsh beginning to roar, and Graff from the third won't roar but maybe some of them up there will. The third congressional district, gentlemen, stand a pretty close second to the sixth in this proposition, a very close second, and I believe it is a good idea to leave this question alone at this time. Danielson: Now for the information of a few and I am going a little bit further into it, where Mr. Graff left off, taking the figures that were presented here yesterday before this Board you will find that the vote was 32,125 in the first; divide that among your five members and it makes each member of that district represent 6,423 votes. You go on to the second district with 28.875 with three members; divide that and you find there are 9.625. You take the sixth, they represent 10,167; you take 9,625 from your 10,167 and you are down to 542 votes, thus the man n the sixth represents just 542 votes more than he does in the second. Go down to the third and it is only 876. Go down to the fourth and it is 8,105 and the fifth 7238. It appears to me, as has been stated before, I will admit the first and fourth have the advantage but if there is </seg>

Doehling: This matter was brought up here yesterday and we agreed to leave it to that committee and they brought in their report and it was accepted. Why do we want to say they did not do the right thing? I think I should abide by their decision at present. Von Forell: We are going to keep sweet and not quarrel. I played a trick on my friend but I kept him here and that is what I was after. Ryan: A point of order, that question has not been put. President Roberts: A motion to reconsider has been put Calls for the question. Von Forell: I do not care to say any more. President Roberts: Those favoring the motion will manifest it by saying aye, contrary no. The motion lost. Smith: I believe the president wants to be fair with us and I know he will be: I ask in all fairness for a division. You have ruled and called for a division on e"ery question. If anyone is trying to dodge this vote they wont want to stand up. President Roberts: Gentlemen, a standing vote. Seven in favor, the balance opposed. President Robarts: We will have to declare that motion lost. Mr. Smith. Is there any further business to present to this meeting? Now is the time before the election of members.

            <seg id="p124">124 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE HOUSE PRACTICE AS A HIGH SCHOOL STUDY i A talk delivered by Maud Wilson before the Nebraska Home Economics Association, January, 1915) All of you know, from your own girlhood experience or from your experience in the training of daughters or younger sisters, that it is harder to interest young girls in the processes relating to the house than to interest them in cooking or sewing. There are a number of rea - sons for this: In the first place, girls learn to cook by first doing things that are easy and pleasant, such as making candy or simple desserts. Do you remember the first dish you ever made? How anxiously you watched the members of your family to see if they liked it, and when father said, "Seems to me these baked apples are unusually good to - night, I believe I'd rather like another," you were so pleased that you fairly shouted. "Papa, I baked them." Girls learn to sew by making doll clothes, and their interest in sewing is stimulated by a love of color and beautiful lines, and by their desire to wear pretty clothes. They are taught housekeeping through no such pleasant media. The average girl's first housekeeping lesson is dishwashing — -not her doll's dishes, but the real dishes. Then she learns to sweep, and to mop floors and dust furniture — tasks that cannot arouse her interest unless she is taught the reasons for doing them and the easiest and quickest ways of doing them well. She is taught to perform the more interest - ing tasks, such as planning out housework for the day or week, doing the marketing, keeping the household accounts, or assisting in the pur - chase of home furnishings. Because she is a girl and is therefore con - sidered incapable of understanding mechanical things, she is not taught to operate the furnace or repair a leaky faucet. So she grows up think - ing that housekeeping is merely cleaning, and it is only when she has to manage a home for herself that she realizes what a world of informa - tion the housekeeper must possess. Modern ready-made garments havi made it possible to clothe one's family well without knowing how to sew; it is possible to provide good meals with only a limited knowledge of cooking, thanks to modern methods of preserving and handling foods The necessity for a knowledge of housekeeping processes, however, has been increased by changing conditions, because the relation of the home to the community is now much more complex, and because our ideals of what constitutes a perfect home have been raised. Granted, then, the difficulty in giving girls this training in the home; granted also the supreme necessity for such training, it remains to be seen whether the school, whose function it is to train for life, can take care of this responsibility. Let us, then, enumerate the divisions that a complete housekeeping course would include; then let us see whether our schools can give this training under the present limitations of equip - ment and time. Logically, the first topic would be the construction of the house, but it is easier to interest a student in something she is closely concerned </seg>
            <seg id="p125">125 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE with, hence we find that a very good starting-point is the care of a girl's own room. After giving the reasons for maintaining cleanliness and order in her own room, and the easiest and best methods of caring for it. then the next step is to take up the decoration and furnishing of this room. I am sure you know how much a girl loves her room if it is at all attractive even upon very limited means. In the consideration of this problem, she must be taught the principles that underlie the choice of color, fabrics, and furnishings, therefore, it is well to pass from this problem to that of decorating and furnishing the rest of the house. The interest of the girls in this problem is surprising. They learn to ob - serve closely, and to figure out the reasons for things. They learn in selecting furniture and curtains and wallpapers to imagine each article its place. They learn how to make a house a cheerful, attractive. iroughly livable place — a real home. After the girls are imbued with the spirit of the good housekeeping then it is time enough to teach the more prosaic details of hcuse eaning. The girls are surprised to find that they like the lesson on the care of food and food containers, of wood, of metals and of textiles, because they are taught in a simple, concrete way, the principles of sanitation. We perform this little experiment in the House Practice class in the School of Agriculture: Moisten a cube of fresh bread, touch it to the top of the door where it is apt ot get a thick coating of jst; and put in a warm place. In a few days we have a luxuriant l. rowth of molds — black and green and blue and pink and gray. After this object lesson, dust becomes a live thing, and the reasons for keeping &gt;ut of our houses very real and tangible. Girls of high school age are so quick to see. We have a number of pictures of interiors, advertising material procured from dealers in house furnishings, and the girls are asked to criticise these just to see whether they are really getting these principles firmly fixed. Their criticisms are strikingly to the point. "That wallpaper has a wiggly design — shouldn't like to be ill in that room." "That rug is too light - colored — it doesn't make a good background for the furniture." "That picture is hung too high — it would hurt your neck so much to look at it that you just never would." "That table looks weak in the legs — looks as if it would shake if one tried using it for a writing table." "That man - tlepiece is a regular three-ring circus — it has so many things on it." House Practice, as you see, is not only concerned with the development of high standards in home life, but with the means of attaining the ideal. The girls learn that it is the business of the housekeeper to make a home out of a house, and that this may be done even with the most limited means. Something of house construction is necessary — the best materials to use in building a house, the points one must have in mind in selecting a building site — just those points which a housekeeper must know in order to build a house that will satisfy the needs of the family.

They learn to operate the furnace. They become familiar with the details of the plumbing system of the house — such knowledge as enables the house - keeper to keep the household machinery running smoothly all the time. Perhaps the most interesting division of this subject is that which has to do with the management of the home, for it includes problems of the sort that appeal tc the girl who is just finding herself. Haven't you heard your sixteen-year-old daughter say, "Mama, if you'll just let me do this all alone, I'll get along all right." Or perhaps you have said of your daughter, "Mary can do splendidly when she wants to. The other day when I was ill she did the work and prepared lunch just as nicely as I could." The very next day you may find that Mary is careless and indifferent. Our aim in teaching home management is to develop this interest which girls have, in working out problems independently, and to emphasize the dignity of the household as a business institution, to be conducted on business principles. We begin with the consideration of the home as a business. We speak of the training that a woman needs for her position. Then we proceed with a detailed study of some of the business principles involved. We study the budget — and we make budgets for families under various circumstances. Then we take up the matter of keeping household and personal accounts, and we keep accounts. We take up the question of buying supplies — the things one must know in order to buy intelligently. The most fascinating division of hrrr.e management is the working out of schedules for housework. We begin with the typical family, under ordinary conditions, and plan out the work of the various mem - bers of the family with a view toward dividing responsibility, keeping - family machinery running smoothly and lightening the work of the housewife. This may all sound rather vague, but there is not time in this short discussion to make the matter more definite and concrete. I have out - lined a House Practice Course such as high school students are capable of assimilating, and it remains to be seen what can be done toward making the work practical and concrete. Well planned laboratory work is essential, but, fortunately, there need be no separate laboratory roon or special equipment provided. The main helps of the House Practice teacher are well-made charts for use in teaching house construction, heating, waste disposal, etc., and advertising material, such as booklets and catalogs, in teaching house furnishing. Excursions are very profitable if carefully planned. They put stu - dents in touch with the life of the community — with actual conditions. By visiting markets they become familiar with grades and classes of foodstuffs and with the manner in which they are handled. Merchants are thoroughly in sympathy with any means for educating the consumer, </seg>

Patrons offer the use of their homes as laboratories when it comes to the work of cleaning and arrang - ing the house. Houses in process of construction, and empty houses are ideal for studying house planning and construction. Therefore, because the laboratory of the House Practice class in the ■ommunity, and because money is not needed for equipment, no high school, however small, is debarred from introducing the course. It is a pity that some of our high schools don't start their Home Economics departments by introducing this course, instead of waiting till they have money to equip food or sewing laboratories. We hope that in the neat - future our Nebraska high school, which already have courses in foods clothing, will round out their work by taking up this oi problem. ECONOMY IN DRESS During the past few decades we find a great increase of individual wealth in the United States. This has made possible the spending of more and more money by individuals in personal adornment and home decoration, until today we find a general tendency among women of all asses to spend an undue amount of their income on dress. This ap- not only to our women of wealth who spend extravagant amounts ress regardless of cost but it applies to a large number of women in able or moderate or even poor circumstances who spend for dress money which is out of proportion to their income and to rt hich they spend for other necessities. an Extravagant expenditures of money for dress, whether indulged in he women who do not have to consider cost or by those who do need mize is never advantageous. It is apt to develop a love of su - show and a spirit of selfishness in the spender herself. It is very apt to set an example which is followed by those of less means who are able to imitate only by using cheap, coarse, flimsy, showy fabrics whi.-h have no wearing qualities, which are in poor taste and which are apt to have a degrading moral effect on the wearer. It is apt to cause of dissatisfaction and imitation among the working classes who desire to imitate those who are better off financially than they but who haven't the means to do it. It is apt to cause the young wage earner to sacrifice other things — proper food, good housing conditions, etc.. in order to spend more of her wages than she should for dress, attempting in that way to bridge the difference between herself and those better off financially than she by imitating what they wear. The ability to use money wisely, every woman should learn, for as the cost of living increases and the demands upon the family purse in - crease, it is important that the women of the household should know how to spend the family income wisely and economically. Statistics (By Helen Lee Davis.) </seg>
            <seg id="p128">128 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE show that from twelve to twenty per cent of the income should be spent for clothing, this division of income having been worked out by many economists and social workers. Knowing the amount we have to spend. I want to consider, first. a few points in the choice and purchase of garments of materials for garments which women should think about if that money is to be spent to the best advantage, for it is a lamentable fact that, while we are willing to think for ourselves and to express our ideas freely on most subjects, in the matter of clothes we too often allow someone else to do our thinking for us. This accounts for a great deal of the thoroughly bad and uneconomical dressing today. Fashion, when blindly followed, causes a big waste of expenditure in dresa. Each year it dictates certain materials which become the new fashionable materials of the year; it indicates certain colors so that each season has its new and so-called fashionable colors; it dictates certain styles which become the styles of the year. These are advocated by the manufacturers, the dyers, and the designers for trade gains and they demand prices far beyond their value while, in vogue. Women, a - many of them, who desire to be considered fashionable, adopt them blindly and gladly, simply because they are said to be the latest ia style regardless of cost, regardless of whether they are becoming to them suited to their figure, their style, their clothing, etc.. regardle&gt;- oi whether they are appropriate for the use to which they are to be put This universal adoption of certain styles, certain materials each year gives us effects which are very objectionable; is responsible for an ex - travagant waste of money in dress. Women should not only have a knowledge of the amount of mom they have to spend and of their own individual requirements; that i what is best suited to them as to material, color, style, etc.. but th« should have a knowledge of materials; be good judges of quality; i prices, etc., know what materials wear best; what colors stand wel know good cloth of all kinds from the appearance and the feei ot the pie-ji know the amount needed and what should be paid for it. So mar women trust to the judgment of the clerk. You often hear such t|ue tions as this asked when buying cottons and linens: (1) Will it wash? You are always assured that the colors are fa*t. although it may be the clerk's first day behind the counter. Women should know what colors stand washing best in the different materials; which stand light, wear, etc., best. (2). Will it shrink. It is the clerks business to say. "N'o. it has already been shrunk" or "It is guaranteed not to shrink. Women should know that if the material is linen, it will shrink, the amount de - pending on the weave, etc.. and that the same thing is true of cottons, only in a lesser degree. (3). How many yards do I need? And the clerk's answer. "We usually sell so many yards. Regardless of how the garment is U&gt; be made; regardless of the size of the person. </seg>
            <seg id="p129">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 129 This lack of knowledge on the part of the consumer of the amount of material required for a garment, and the reliance placed on the sales man for information, is a frequent cause of unnecessary expense. Un- less there is a special reason for purchasing an extra amount of goods, it is usually an economic loss to have more than is needed. Women should know what they want before going to buy. They should spend with a definite purpose. People who drift in and out of stores, influenced by every bargain sale and "reduced goods" counter waste a good deal of money. Bargain sales, as usually conducted, are a doubtful advantage for the ordinary shopper. You will find poor materials, good materials wit.. defects in the weave shop-worn goods and some good values all thrown in together on counter. These confuse the purchaser and unless you are a good judge of values and are well informed as to regular prices, yon won't reap any benefit from such sales. The average woman is better off to purchase staple articles at standard prices. A bargain isn't a genuine bargain unless you are at least receiving full value for money spent, and a little more — but this supposed "reduction in price" is great influence in the lives of thousands of women. They can't seem to resist a clever "ad" in the paper or a well displayed shop window or bargain counter and so many times the articles offered there are things that they would never have dreamed of buying if it had not been marked "reduced." The fact that it was advertised as selling for less than the usual price created the desire to buy it. It is a fact that great profits are made at these sales and bargain counters. Take the white goods sales each year. It is an institution of nearly fifty years standing and for that many years its success has been the envy of the progressive store owners of America, so you will find it emulated in every business district today and large profits made. At most sales you don't find the permanent goods; that is, the standard materials, the demand for which is steady and constant from year to year, but in the "White Sales" you will often find much of the regular stock. With it you will find a great deal of low grade, "bought r the occasion " material, cheap embroideries, cheap laces, etc. It is true that much of this material is sold cheap and, considering the wear it gives, you possibly get, in many cases, more than you pay for, but the sacrifice, remember, is not with the store. They sell that low grade of underwear, laces, and embroideries cheap because they bought them cheaper. They bought them cheap because they were made in a factory or sweatshop where the life and toil of men. women and children are bought cheap, where people are being underpaid all the while and where the working conditions are intolerable. At these White Sales, you need to be a good judge of materials, prices, etc., otherwise you will be deceived as to values, amounts of im- perfections, etc. At remnant sales women often lose money by getting more ma- terial than they need or an insufficient amount. If you get three and </seg>
            <seg id="p130">130 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE half yards of material for the cost of three and only need three or per - haps less, do you gain anything? And yet a great many women can't resist the getting of something for nothing. Often remnants are cut from goods on shelves and put into a sale at the same or an advanced price. At fire or damaged goods sales, money is often lost. Here one needs to examine goods carefully and to be a good judge. Goods may bo permanently weakened. The soil may be a stain that won't come out. The soiled and damaged parts are often concealed and escape one's notice. You take the risk with eyes open, but these defects and dam - ages often prove to be worse than at first appears. The clearance sales are for the purpose of making room for tht new stock. Extra stock is often imported for this occasion and ven often this stock is inferior to the usual grade carried by that store. This is put in with the materials they are trying to sell, and a good profit realized on the whole. Baying between seasons when prices are lowered is wise if the purchaser knows exactly what she wants and can herself make su'h changes as w.i'1 bring the garment up to date. Another fact that an economical shopper soon learns is this — that certain artiiles may be purchased to greater advantage at one place than another- one store excels in silks, one linens, one gloves, etc. It is a point of economy in dress, as a rule, to buy good materials To mtny women, being "economical " means getting the most for as little money as possible regardless of the character or the efficiency of the goods. That ideal does not hold in any other phase of life and it doesn't in dress. It pays to buy good materials for clothes which are to receive hard wear — suits, coats, waists, underwear, shoes, stockings, etc. One good garment will outwear two cheap ones and look better during that period of service. Inexpensive materials have their economic place, however — for light colored dresses which soil easily and which will be only occasionally used, for party dresses which will not be much used, etc., but for hard usage, it pays to buy good material. It pays to buy good plain underwear. Careful buyers never purchase washable outside garments or underwear without considering the laun - dering of those garments. The expense is high for having garments with much trimming laundered, and each week you are adding to the expense of that garment. The making of clothes at home has many advantages if the time of the worker is not greater value in some other direction. Take under - wear, for instance; in the cheap, ready-made underwear you will find poor materials, cheap trimmings, poor workmanship, poor designs, designs. scanty patterns, etc. The advantages of the garment made at home over the cheap ready-made garments are not in the initial cost but in the increased length of service and comfort, and the satisfaction which </seg>
            <seg id="p131">PROCEEDING NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 131 comes from having garments which are appropriate and in good taste. In high priced ready-made underwear you can get good materials, trim - mings, designs, and workmanship, but here the initial cost is much more ttan if made at home. The same thing is true of dresses. Most of them if made at home cost less and wear longer than ready-made but if one's time is well occupied and the saving of all one's energy for the daily work has to be considered, it may be more economical to buy ready-made or hire garments made. In having dresses or underwear made, the cost is more in the making than in the material. Economy, here, comes in purchasing good wearing materials, choosing conserva - tive styles and having fewer garments made, thus saving dressmaker's bills, for it costs as much to have a cheap silk made as a good one. Knowing how to renovate materials, remodel clothes, retrim hats, etc., is a point of economy in dress. I want to speak also of the "doesn't pay" attitude in regard to mending and plain sewing. Today you will hear well-reared girls say, "Oh, I buy cheap stockings and throw them away when the holes come. It doesn't pay to mend nowadays." Or, "Make shirtwaists at home? No, it doesn't pay. I can buy pretty lace trimmed and embroidered waists for $1.49 or $1.98 and you know I could not make them at home or have them made for that." No, counting the seamstress' time or your own time, it would cost three or four dollars, but would it not last much longer and be in much better taste? One of pathetic things to me in a working girl's budget published last ight waists at a total cost of $12.00 for one year. i awdry and all worn out at the end of the year. Now as- that she had no time for making, but understood the care and a good waist, would not four waists at $3.00 each have been better investment Vowhere is this false idea of its not paying to sew or mend doing an among our working girls. Who buys the $1.25, $1.49, re and embroidery, which tear out in a few wash- the girl with the small income — the salesgirl, the factory naid? The very ones who should get the best value for re the ones who are caught the hardest by the cheap ready-to-wear articles. I am not trying to insist that women should spend all their spare time sewing, but when you see the strained anxious faces hunting the bargain counters, you cannot help wondering whether the same amount of time and thought, quietly spent in the sewing room at home, would not show better results. The proper care of all clothing is a factor in the economy of dress. Brushing, pressing, cleaning, mending, proper storage, etc., all add to the life of the garment and to its appearance while being worn. These are only a few of the points which a woman must keep in mind if she is to be well and economically dressed. They are perhaps enough to show that a woman trained in the knowledge of textiles and in textile buying; who has definite ideas of her needs in dress, of the </seg>
            <seg id="p132">132 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE amount of money she has to spend; and how she is going: to spend it, before purchasing, can make an income go twice as far as the one who buys without careful planning. HOW TO BEAUTIFY THE HOME AT SMALL EXPENSE By Irwin F. Frey When the subject was handed to me, my first the about as much about farms, as the avera houses, and with this in mind I have carefully kept away from the chard, the buildings, and in fact everything exee ediate home yard. As we travel along the country roads of Xeb tern states, we cannot but help notice especial small amount of time or thought the average fa the immediate surroundings of his home. The family are spending 99 per cent of their days. Th« that should be made attractive for young people, as wel older ones. And, as we think of the small expense farm homes more attractive. The thoug subject which the average farmer has paid little certainly is not a lack of thrift for our most successful times the most negligent in keeping up their home ya There are two places, some ten miles north of Lincoln, that are a joy to see. After passing from either side for several miles, homes with perhaps a few trees inside of fenced-in yards, i These fences by the way must be to keep in the owner's dog or keep out his neighbors' stock, as the rest of the farm is usually fenced off from the yard anyway. The grass, if any, has been left to talc care of itself, and the few weeds in the corners. We come to two homes, there is a lawn, perhaps 150 feet across at each one. The grass is kept mowed as neatly as any town yard, in the center of one of these yards is a canna bed, perhaps six feet across which cost $2.00 to $3.00 to buy plants for. In the other yard, there is a geran - ium bed, about the same size at same cost. Three or four shade trees are on either side of the yard and as these homes face to the east, two or three trees are growing in the back yard, these giving shade from the hot after - noon sun. There is no fence to obstruct the view from the road, and a lasting impression is. that these people get more pleasure at home, than their neighbors, possibly, can get. The cost of beautifying a country home is practically nothing, com- pared to the pleasure derived. To b? sure a certain amount of labor must be done, but this work shovM be a pleasure, and done in the same spirit with which the man in town plants his garden in the spring. A well kept lawn, even though of limited size, is necessary and this should be prepared in the early winter. Vines should be planted, where </seg>

These vines can be ob- e ed for a few cents, if Morning Glories, Cinnamon Vine, ;ain Scarlet Climber or Moonvines will answer your purpose, and will only chicken wire until they get a good start, or if some- ning is wanted which will be permanent, try Clematis, Paniculata or jme of the fast growing roses, such as Dorothy Perkins, White Perkins, Red Exceisa. The cost of these is nothing compared with their sa ear. For the porches around the house there is hat I know of, as satisfactory as these clematis, and varieties of hey are not subject to mildew as are the Crimson and other ramblers. If there are any corners, plant a few Hardy Phlox, Iris, keeping each kind in groups, and if something is desired the side fence use Spireas, Hydrangeas and Syringes, between Holly Hocks or Larkspur may be planted. These blooming later mentioned to be taken, as my view, that the varieties mentioned which can be planted, and from which pleasure can be derived. every farmer, that will start in with a well kept lawn ery limited number of flowers or shrubs will increase his plant - ry year, as he notes their beauty. Thus steadily increasing the of his home as well as his influence for further good along the same among his neighbors. iw often we hear of the beautiful farms in this or that county of. Why is this ? Is it not because some farmer has seen beyond beyond to the immediate surroundings of his home .and beau- ified his yard. Only to be followed by his neighbors and they by their neighbors, and finally we have a community spoken of as beautiful. THE SELLING OF PURE BRED CATTLE (By Frank D. Tomson) Every breeder of beef cattle should recognize at the outset that a por - tion of his product each year is better suited for the slaughter house than for the improvement of the breed. The breeding of improved stock may - be a science but no man has ever mastered it, as a science. That it is an art seems to admit of no discussion, but that herd has never come within my observation that has not produced occasionally an animal that was a disappointment, considering its ancestry and environment. The success of any breeder in making sales very largely depends on the character of the stock maintained in the breeding herd and for sale. The consignment of the less favored animals to the beef markets serves a double purpose. It raises the standard of the individual herd and prevents the transfer to less experienced hands of animals that are not apt to work improvement. When embarking in the breeding of improved stock one should inform himself, as far as possible, with the conditions prevailing in the sections in which his trade is most likely to develop and then plan his invest- </seg>
            <seg id="p134">134 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE merits and efforts accordingly. It is a mistake for anyone to assume that he can enter this business and at the outset claim among "his patrons the established breeders. Patronage is largely influenced by the reputation of the breeder and this is only obtained by long years of identity with the calling. However, it is a business that cannot be monopolized or domina - ted by a few. It is an open field with alluring prospects to any who may combine the art of producing anil the art of selling. There scarcely exists another business that admits of success with as little ability required in the sales end as this. The man who produces the right type, of favored ancestry, has the advantage of buyers seeking his product, and with a reasonable selling instinct is assured of lucrative returns. But if he be a clever salesman his profits may be materially en - hanced and at the same time transfer to his patrons an added value in advertising, commensurate with the investment. Fixed prices are an unknown quantity. They are mainly controlled by the lines of breeding desired, the standard of excellence and the gen - eral condition of the animal. The matching of wits of the seller and buyer are also potent but incidental. A fact that seems peculiar to this vocation is that the buyer of im - proved stock is always an enthusiastic buyer. He may drive sharp bar - gains, may figure closely and assume an attitude wholly lacking in opti - mism, but in this he practices clever deception. It matters little whether he dominates in the price making of the transaction or not, as soon as it is concluded he is confident that he has secured a bargain. He forsees possibilities, he predicts great outcome and entertains no doubt that his selections are worth vastly more than the investment indicates. This phase of the business is an interesting one and the breeder who compre - hends it gains a profitable advantage in dealing with his patrons. For many years my relations with the cattle breeding fraternity have been of a more or less intimate nature and frequently after the close of a public sale I have been assured by different breeders that had participa - ted in the sale, that each had, in his own judgment, secured the real bargain of that particular sale. This illustrates the point just made that the buyer of improved stock is an optimistic investor. There is no business within my knowledge in which the satisfied cus - tomer proves so large an asset to the seller. He employs many and various means of advertising his satisfaction with his purchase. His advocacy of your cause, if you be the seller, and his individual success turn many a subsequent buyer your way. So, it is worth while that any breeder take special pains to see that a patron is not dissappointed in the character and the outcome of his purchase, for in so doing he safe - guards his own interests, broadens his opportunities and stimulates a wider field of patronage. Instances are not uncommon in which an animal sold at a low price, and within a few months changed hands at a much higher figure, and others where animals have sold at long prices that proved a failure in the breeding herd. The element of speculation is always present. I </seg>
            <seg id="p135">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 135 recall one instance where a yearling heifer sold for $25 and the seller was entirely satisfied with the price, which seemed a fair one, yet her first calf sold as a yearling: for over $600 at auction, after a successful campaign in the show ring. These are recurring instances that render the breeding and selling of improved stock a business of fascinating in - terest and induces many worthy men to spend long years identified with its activities. My experience leads me to conclude that the largest profits are avail - able by retaining the older cows for breeding purposes, adding to them from time to time the heifers that offer best promise as producers. These females may be maintained at a normal cost, and in moderate conditions which will insure them being more regular producers. The young things should then be given liberal care to insure the earliest development and most attractive appearance. They will appeal most readily to the buyers and invariably command a better price than the older females that lack the bloom and freshness of youth. This plan is regularly practiced by successful breeders and may be safely adopted by the inexperienced. If you will bear in mind that your prospective buyer is almost invar - iably in quest of animals that will improve his own standards, you will have made real progress as a salesman of pure bred cattle. ANGUS CATTLE IN THE FEED LOT (By J. A. Amsberry) This subject has been assigned to me, and as I have not been feeding very extensively, I will have to depend largly on others for data if I prove that Angus make the best feeding cattle. What feeding I have done I have found the Angus always ahead, from start to finish. When sold in Omaha the blacks would be put in a pen by themselves and I would receive $1.00 per hundred more for the Angus than for the others. I do not believe the packers would pay this dollar extra because they were black-haired, but rather because they know the Angus cattle, on an average, dress a greater per cent to the live weight than other cattle. One of my neighbors who had always talked against the Angus, but in buying feeders in the country, happened to get a carload of black steers in his feed lot. Two months before his main bunch of cattle was ready to go on the market, this carload of blacks was good enough to be shipped to Omaha, and topped the market for the week. I have never feed my best cattle, but sold them for breeding and feed the culls. Not that there has not always been a margin in the right kind of feeding of the right kind of cattle; but when we could sell our bull calves before they were a year old. with but little extra feed and care, for $100 per head, that seeme&lt;l the shortest way to the money, and that, of course, has been our main object in staying in the cattle business. Before the large ranches were broken up, we seldom had enough bulls </seg>
            <seg id="p136">136 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE to supply the demand, and we did not dare get them too fat or the stock - men would not buy them. But last spring we had fourteen bulls left over, and just sold the last one the 15th of this month. We do not think it pays to hold bulls over, so we are feeding seventy-two head of calves, bulls and all, and if we still have the bulls when the other calves are ready to go, they will go, too; and next year I will be prepared to tell you some experience with Angus calves in the feed lot, if I also am here. We find the Angus in the feed lot in as good shape at four months as the common cattle are when they have fed six months. Still there are a greater per cent of scrub cattle here than there were twenty years ago. I attended a sale a short time ago and a registered two-year-old Shorthorn bull sold for $65, and I confess I could not tell from what breed of cattle he had originated. I hope the chairman will not fall out with me for wandering from my subject either now or later on. I said in the beginning, not having made a business, that I would have to depend on what others had done by their success at the fairs and at the International Live Stock Exposition. A complete analysis of a tabulated list of awards of the single steer or heifer competition reveals very forcibly the substantial, steady growth the Aberdeen Angus breed has made since the inception of the Inter - national Live Stock Exposition. A careful review of the awards in the classes in which single animals of all breeds competed, should prove very clearly that, while the Hereford and Shorthorn breeds were conspicuous for their winnings the first few years of the show, it has become apparent during recent years that the Aberdeen Angus bullocks have gained in overwhelming numbers over both the Shorthorns and Herefords. The actual proverb of the superiority of the Aberdeen Angus breed is set forth in the following synopsis of comparison, which covers fourteen ourt International Live Stock Expositions: In competing for championships, out of fourteen possible champion - ships for grades and cross-breeds, Aberdeen Angus won eight; Herefords two; Shorthorns, three; mixed Aberdeen- Angus-Shorthorn, one; and in the same class only twelve reserves were reported, which were won as follows: Aberdeen Angus, four; Herefords, five; one mixed Shorthorn- Gallaway; one mixed Aberdeen-Angus-Shorthorn, one mixed Hereford Aberdeen- Angus. Out of fourteen possible grand championships and four reserves (com - petition open to pure breds, grades and cross-breeds) Aberdeen Angus won ten grand championships and nine reserves grand championships; Herefords won three of each and the Shorthorn one of each. Out of twelve grand champion steer herd prizes, Aberdeen-Angus won ten; Herefords one; and a mixed herd of Aberdeen-Angus-Shorthorn- Gallaway, one. Only ten of the twelve reserve grand championship steer herd prizes were reported, four being won by Aberdeen Angus; three by Herefords; two by Shorthorns and one by a mixed breed. Out of forty-two possible champion awards by ages (pure breeds, grades and cross-breeds competing) Aberdeen Angus won 24; Hereford </seg>
            <seg id="p137">137 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 11; Shorthorns 6; mixed Herefords-Aberdeen Angus 1. Out of thirty - eight reserves which were reported, Aberdeen- Angus won 20; Herefords 9; Shorthorns 7; mixed Shorthorns-Gallaways 1; Hereford- Aberdeen Angus 1. Out of the grand total of one hundred fifty-seven champion and re - serve champion awards. Aberdeen Angus won 90; Herefords 37; Short- horns 21; and mixed 9 &gt; facts should serve as a conclusive proof of the superior merits Aberdeen Angus breed in the single steer and heifer competition. have this to say for the man who thinks he has the dual purpose cattle. I maintain there is no middle ground. It we breed our beef we reduce their beef qualities. If we breed our milk reduce their capacity for making milk. My plan for ws for se cow would be like this: Take a bull from the breed that has many hard things said about them. One man was mean enough to lat they were just for those who were too proud to milk a 1 not afford to own a cow. I refer to the Jersey. Take a Jersey bull and cross it on one of the beef breeds for twenty years, and what I call a dual purpose cow — good for neither beef nor If you will pardon me, I will make another illustration of that kind of reeding. Take the horse, for instance. Use a thoroughbred stallion, use iim on one of the four breeds of draft mares for twenty years, and you iave a race horse that would lose you all the money you could put up, i he would make just as great a success in front of a gang plow or would a race horse. But suppose you breed thorough e rses straight for twenty years, you will then have a horse you will not be afraid to back with your money, and especially if your op ponents are dual purpose horse advocates. Now, I would like to say a few words to young men just starting in farming and stockraising. If you wish to milk cows, start with Jerseys. They will produce more butterfat for the feed consumed than any other breed with which I have had experience. If you want to raise beef cattle go to a reliable buyer of Angus cattle. Take his advice as to what is good, for he knows better than you do, and if he is really honest he will tell you, and not charge you more for such cattle than they are worth. One very essential thing is to keep your cows registered. Then by referring to the herd books you can tell what your stock in trade amounts to. Then if you wish to feed males and have gotten them ready and ship them to Chicago — the biggest stock market in the world — I will guaran - tee that you will get more money than the other fellow with a different breed of cattle. Now, when you have associated with these cattle from their babyhood and the last six months you will know for a certainty what Aberdeen Angus will do in the feed lot. </seg>

We hardly need an efficiency expert to call to our attention the fact that throughout all of the western country there is an annual waste of the by-products of grain farming which can hardly be estimated. There are thousands of acres of corn stalks that are never utilized, and other thousands of acres of wheat straw. Further west, large bodies of land held for speculative purposes produce an abundance or grass which might profitably be converted into beef. A feeding test at Hays, Kansas, during the winter showed that kafir silage, when fed in the right proportion with straw ar cottonseed or linseed meal, was the cheapest winter feed obtainable. In one lot of cows in this test, each cow received 20.05 p&lt; .it silage, 17.13 pounds of straw and one pound of cottonseei During the one hundred days feeding test they made a s weight and the cost for each cow per thousand pounds of liv only $4.40. This is indeed cheap winter feed. Another ral a little more, but which is probably a better ration to use bee; came through in a more thrifty condition, was as follows: 35.63 pounds kafir silage 14.20 pounds wheat straw ) Dail 1.00 pounds cottonseed meal On this ration each cow gained 1.34 pounds per day it the feeding period they were exceptionally strong and thrifty. T for one hundred days was $5.84 per thousand pounds of live weigl At the same time and under the same conditions, in another lot of nin - teen cows, each was fed 27.20 pounds of kafir fodder, 10.28 pounds of wheat straw and one pound of cottonseed meal per day. They made a daily gain of only one-half pound of live weight. These tests show kafir silage to be better and much cheaper than kafir fodder, and, in addition, it is easier to feed. In this test, kafir silage was valued at $2.66 per ton, straw at 50 cents per ton, and cottonseed meal at $30 per ton. Kafir fodder frrown under the same conditions was worth $5 per ton. Another point that shows the ad - vantage of converting the kafir crop into silage is the fact that in this feeding test it took a half more acreage to produce the kafir fodder than to produce the kafir silage for the same number of cows where the best silage ration is considered, and more than twice as much acreage to pro - duce the fodder as to produce the silage where the cheapest silage ration is considered.

            <seg id="p140">140 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE It is almost impossible to give the value of the stover utilized in this experiment as it was carried over from the previous year when there was no market for it. Wheat straw was a similar waste product. The kafir silage was made from a crop which had failed to head in such manner as to utilize it for a grain crop. The result is that these cattle were wintered at an expense of $1.85 per head for labor and $2.6E for feeds of a commercial value. The remainder of the cost was fron feeds which would otherwise have had absolutely no value in the sec- tion where it was grown that year The preceding exhibits show that a breeding c( at a coet of 4.5 cents to 10 cents per day, depending upon the meth of harvesting the storage crops which are grown with a degree certainty in any section of the state, that the acreage to carry a cow during the winter is much less than that require grazing purposes. Assuming that the wintering period is for six months the total cost will vary from $6.50 to $15.00 per head. Grazing Kansas has an actual cash value ranging from $6.50 to $8.00 for the season, depending upon the kind of grass and the locality in which it is rented. The feed cost of maintenance for one year under these condi - tions will be from $13.00 to $23.00 per head, to which should be added $2.00 for bull service and $3.00 for interest and insurance, making the cost of maintenance from $18.00 to $28.00. Cows which fail to breed will have an increased value sufficient to offset the cost of maintenance. The value of the average high grade calf at weaning time in Kansas during the fall of 1914 was in the neighborhood of $30.00. which results in a handsome financial profit under existing conditions. If in addition we make allowance for the saving of feed frequently brought about by the use of wheat pasture, the advantage of a market on the farm for the roughage produced, the increased efficiency of labor due to permanent employment, and the increased yields of crops due to the maintenance of cattle on the farm, there seems to be no reasonable excuse for not keeping our farms up to their maximum cattle carrying capacity.

            <seg id="p141">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 141 r WINTERING STOCKERS AND FEEDERS By Prof. A. Cochel) Investigational work in wintering stockers and feeders has not as yet reached the point where definite and final results as to the efficiency methods can be presented. In finishing cattle for market the improve- hilc they are in the feed lot and the rapidity and cost of gains are the determining factors. In wintering stockers and feeders these same factors must be considered, and, in addition, the effect of winter feeding upon subsequent gains on grass or in the feed lot must be measured. Stock cattle should be wintered at low cost and in such manner that they will make normal growth and go to pasture in such condition as will permit maximum and efficient utilization of grass. It may be profitable when roughage and concentrates are very high in price, to allow them to lose a little flesh which they can regain in the cheaper pasture, rather than to add sufficient amount of high priced grain to keep them in most attractive appearance. Feeder cattle should be wintered on such feeds as will not only produce maximum growth but also permit an increase in condition or flesh in order that the length of the feeding period may be reduced and that they may not be required to replace flesh with high priced grain and other concentrates This result can usually be attained by the addition of a small amount of corn, or corn and some concentrate rich in protein, where legumes do not constitute a portion of the rough - age. With this point kept in mind the discussion will be confined largely to the handling of stockers. Stockers should be wintered largely on roughage in order to reduce the cost of maintenance and to furnish a market for feeds of low commercial value. A further reason is that large •onsumption of roughage develops capacity for food which may enable hem to make better use of grass and of concentrated feeds when they are eventually put into the feed lot. An ideal ration for wintering them should be palatable, low in cost and furnish digestible nutrients in proper proportion. In those sections of the state where alfalfa or clover is grown exten - sively, either of these feeds should be utilized in sufficient quantities to furnish protein. To this should be added other roughage such as silage, corn stover, cane hay or butts from the non-saccharine sorghums, such as kafir, feterita or milo. Where there is a deficiency in roughage, silage should be put up as there is no other way to utilize suitable crops which will result in so large an amount of digestible nutrients per acre as by putting them in a silo. Criticism is frequently heard to the effect that cattle wintered on silage will not make satisfactory gains on grass. This is due to tho fact that cattle wintered on silage usually make more rapid gains, hence carry a greater amount of flesh to grass than those wintered on dry feeds. It is generally known that thin rather than fleshy cattle make more rapid gain during the grazing season. Another reason for the failure of silage-fed cattle to gain rapidly is that they carry a consid- </seg>
            <seg id="p142">142 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE erable fill to pasture, hence do not make the phenomenal sains due to the filling up process during the first month of the grazing season. If the amount of silage is reduced to such an extent that the gains are no larger in winter on silage-fed than on dry-fed cattle, then summer gains will be approximately the same. In many sections of Nebraska, it is impossible to grow alfalfa or clover successfully, hence the feeds are incapable of furnishing an ade - quate amount of protein. It is then necessary to provide some feed rich in protein to make up this deficiency. There are several feeds, such as linseed meal, cottonseed meal or cold pressed cake which can be secured, the particular kind depending on market prices. This year it is un - doubtedly some of the cottonseed products, as they furnish protein cheaper than it can be secured in any other form. This should be used in limited amounts and it is best fed with silage as a carrier, in order that each individual may get his proportionate share. The accompanying table gives the results secured in wintering stocker calves at the Kansas Experimental Station during the winter of 1912-1913 and throws considerable light upon the results which may be expected under practical conditions.

The show as a whole was one that we need to feel proud of, from the point of quality, as I do not think there was ever a show of Cattle on the Nebraska State Fair grounds, where there was as much quality displayed in every animal in the barn as there was this year. This speaks well for breeders as they are learning: that it does not pay to carry along a lot of inferior animals. It also makes a great deal more pleasing show to the public in general, to see so many animals of this type. While it may make the Cattle Shows of the future a little smaller in numbers, yet it will help raise the standard of all breeds. While the Nebraska Shorthorn men did not maintain their pas cord, yet their exhibit was a credit to themselves, and to the State. The Hereford brought out a surprise in the fact that Thon Bros, of West Point were able to present the Junior Champion B very strong competition.

The Red Polls were a fine lot and evidently gained popularity by th« ract that the ring side was always crowded when they were in the ring. The Holsteins were not as large in numbers as they were two yean igo, but the quality was there, and I hope that another year will bring nit another good show of the Blacks and Whites.

There being no money available for exhibiting purposes in this de - partment, I solicited the Nebraska Creamery Companies and secured $330.00 for an educational dairy display. The latter consisted in a prop- erly constructed, fully equipped and continuously operated farm dairy plant, with additional educational features in the forms of dairy informa - tion given by four experts in charge, the display of a large number of charts and signs, and the distribution of bulletins and other literature pertaining to the dairy industry. In entering the southwest wing of the uiildinjr, the visitors at first would notice the calves, or babies of the iairy breeds, then the five cows with their respective records, represent - ing the Holstein, Jersey, Guernsey, Ayrshire and Shorthorn breeds a rther on in a separate enclosure a model farm milk house show - manufacturing process of dairy products and the finished product in the form of a butter statue, as the crowning feature of the exhibit. Particular interest was displayed in this butter statue which was modeled m a photograph of Dean Burnett, driving a team of horses hitched to i plow; on top of the refrigerator containing this statue, was placed a ife size plaster paris caste of La May, Nebraska's champion cow. This atter exhibit was under the auspices of the Nebraska Dairy and Creamery vement Association. I wish to make special mention of Mr. A. E. Wilkinson, Mr. C. E. Harman, Prof. J. F. Frandsen, and Mr. C. L. Burlingham as being espe - cially prominent among those who helped to make this exhibit a credit to the dairy industry of our state. The exhibits of dairy products were small in number, but good in - terest was displayed in the milking contest and I feel gratified to report that no complaints have been made and that everything has been satis - factory to all competitors and others concerned. , Although dairying is one of Nebraska's leading industries and con - tinuously growing in importance, the exhibiting of dairy stock at our State Fair has been badly neglected in past years and it is for this reason that I recommend the entering of dairy cattle under the supervision of the dairy superintendent. There is no question but what many breeders of pure bred dairv stock in Nebraska and other states will be induced to exhibit at our State Fair if they are properly solicited and encouraged to do so. </seg>

The late L. D.

SECOND ANNUAL STATE FAIR BOYS' SCHOOL ENCAMPMENT The Second Annual Boys' School Encampment was held by the State Board of Agriculture in connection with the State Fair at Lincoln, Neb - raska, September 7 to 11, 1914. The following officers were in charge of the encampment and school: E. Von Forrell of Scottsbluff, Supt. Y. M. C. A. Boys' Secretary, Camp Director; C. W. Pugsley, University Farm, Principal; H. E. Bradford, University Farm, Assistant Principal; E. R. Purcell, Supt. of Amphitheatre. In the division of work the Lincoln Y. M. C. A. was made respon - sible for the boys during their camp hours. Mr. Purcell of the Amphi - theatre was responsible for the ones in his charge during program time, and the Principal and Assistant Principal were responsible for them during the school hours. Selection of the Boys The selection of two boys from each county, one representing a town and one a rural community, was left to the county superintendent, the County Agricultural Society, and the county demonstrator, if there was one in the county. The boys must be between the ages of fourteen and twenty years. Each delegate paid $5 registration fee, and in case his rail - road fare exceeded $5 for the round trip, the State Board refunded the balance. Thus it need not cost a boy over $10 for his camp and school for the week. </seg>

            <seg id="p152">152 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Results Some of the features of camp which meant most to the boys are as follows : 1. Trips to the exhibits of the State Fair, to the University Farm and the different industries of Lincoln. 2. The lectures on practical problems in scientific agriculture by University people. 3. The experience in handling crowds received in ushering at the amphitheatre. 4. The privilege of enjoying the camp spirit and good fellowship. The boys learned to s!ng "The Smile Song" at the camp fires and sang it one night when some people might have relieved their feelings in some other way while the rain poured down and the wind blew the tents over. Friendships were established among these boys from all over Nebraska, which will mean much in years to come. A WELL BALANCED PROGRAM FOR COUNTY FAIRS (Address of James Pearson, Lieutenant Governor, before the Nebraska Association of Fair Managers, held in Lincoln, Tuesday evening Jan. 19, 1915.) Mr. President and Friends : I appear before you this evening, not as an officer of any fair at the present time, but in the roll of a visitor or patron of fairs. I have visited number of fairs in this and other states. I do not insist upon making any apology, but I do frankly admit, that I have no set rule or definition for balancing the program at a county fair. However, I believe most of you who are here this evening, are also very much in the same boat. Without a doubt many of you have better ideas than I, but one thing very certain, and that is that the subject is one of great importance, and needs careful common sense discussion. I 5. Many boys have spoken of how much the association with their camp leaders has meant to them. They were men who appreciated the potential value of thrse boys of the farms and pave this week out of their busy lives simply for the opportunity of touching those lives with their personality and giving them a vision of the real meaning of life. The boys left with the determination to carry back to their communities things which they had gained in encampment. 6. A desire for further education along practical lines was awak- ened in the minds of many boys. The lectures at the school and the talks at the camp fires gave broader vision of life. Respectfully submitted. C. W. PUGSLEY. </seg>
            <seg id="p153">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 153 am inclined to believe a free-for-all discussion of this subject would resu.t in much good. We all realize that various parts of the state cause con - ditions to be different, not because of a different altitude or soil, bjt because of the difference in the people. In some counties we have large settlements of Swedes and it is necesssary that the county fair manage - ment see to it that a little something especially to their liking be on the program, even if nothing else but a good speech by one of their people of immediate vicinity. No doubt but the editor of some Swedish paper would be glad to come and speak to them on "Swede Day," without cost to the association. The same thing applies to settlements of Bohemians, Danes, Germans, etc., in those counties where they are located. I am a great believer in special days, as "Old Settler's Day," "Political Day," etc., and as I said before, a day for foreign recognition. On those days speeches should be arranged befitting the title of the day. Those speeches will not cost hardly anything and bring many into the gates, and no doubt will impart some good information and thought. The setting apart of such days need not detract from the regular part of the program. Per - sonally, I am not much of a race horse man, neither am I in favor of spending very large sums for some quick time amusements, like flying machines, etc. In some instances and where there seems to be an urgent demand, that is allowable, but in many counties that is entirely out of the question. I fear that in many places the people have lost sight of the true purpose of the fair, viz., educational, and are looking for entertain - ment altogether. Fairs must have entertainment, but at the same time the entertainment can be of the beneficial kind. When we realize that hundreds of places spend large sums of money for chautauquas, etc., we are inclined to believe the fair and chautaucjua could be combined in many places. I am inclined to think we are rather negligent about the boys and girls' exhibits. I do not mean exhibits of boys and girls, but exhibits by boys and girls. I believe there should be an educational string tied to their exhibits. For instance, if a boy exhibits a sample of corn he should file a written article of five or six hundred words, setting forth how he grew that corn, etc. Likewise, if a girl exhibits a cake or a loaf of bread, she should file a written recipe of how she made it. Those re - quirements should run clear through the entire junior lists, as far as possible. It is not necessary that the premiums be so very large, but put special stress, through your advertising and through local papers, on the honor of being an exhibitor. What we want is to interest the boys and girls in the fair, because they are to be next in charge and by educating and getting them interested, we are preparing some people for better fairs in a few years hence. It is a well known fact that when you have the boys or girls interested and attending the fair you have the whole family on the come. A supply of inexpensive badges, worded up to show the wearer to be an exhibitor of a certain fair or year, given out to all the exhibitors will stimulate the younger generation and some of the </seg>
            <seg id="p154">154 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE old ones also. To make our fairs better we need more exhibitors in all departments, as multiplied exhibitors increase interest and attendance without increasing costs to any material extent. When you offer first and second prizes or premiums on a certain article it is far better to have eight or ten exhibits competing for those premiums, than to have only two. The moving picture show, equipped with proper films are excellent entertainers, whether they be free or a concession. Right here I want to drop a word of warning against allowing concession privileges to the ordinary Tom, Dick or Harry monkey and dancing shows. The merry - go-round and such other wholesome concession entertainers are very good. Each fair management must know their people and provide amuse - ment and entertainment that is the most liable to please; at the same time not losing sight of the "up lift" principle that should be the ever paramount object with all fairs. Every fair management should en - deavor to so entertain their patrons that the patrons will be benefitted, yes actually benefitted by having attended the fair. I firmly believe some fair associations rob the exhibit departments to boost the races, in purse and publicity. Be careful to take care of your patrons, especially the young people. Fair managers should encourage people to exhibit out of the "boosting spirit" at least. There is scarcely a farmer but who has something on his farm that would make a creditable exhibit, and if you can get people to bring exhibits, "just to help the fair," they will naturally get some premiums and be greatly pleased. Accomodations for visiting are very necessary. At county fairs, the visiting feature is a very noticeable part of the program. People coming from various parts of the county meet their friends, and if a tent or other suitable place is at hand where they may sit down and have a good visit, they are much pleased. A few fair grounds have shade trees, etc., which are very nice, but many do not have such. I once visited a western county fair, where a tent was erected for ladies to go and rest, or care for children. The number of favorable com - ments I heard about that by pleased ladies led me to the conclusion that the management made a wise move in establishing that little convenience. The little cheap conveniences are pleasing to your patrons, and can be established very quickly and cheaply. Look over your grounds and see if there is not some ways of making your patrons more comfortable, without costing the association hardly anything. Comfort is entertainment to many. Then we must try to combine comfort and entertainment for the uplift of the patrons, without being too expensive for the association </seg>
            <seg id="p155">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 155 REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON HORTICULTURE Mr. President and Members of the State Board of Agriculutre: Your Committee on Horticulture begs leave to submit the following report: Horticulture in Nebraska dates back to the time of the first settle - ment of the state. The new settler first broke enough ground to grow a home garden. He broke land for grain crops and experimented with fruits such as he grew in his old home. He found a number of entirely new problems to solve. Experience had to be his teacher. Thanks to the perseverance and industry of the pioneers and their successors, it has been found that certain horticultural crops produced in certain parts of the state are unsurpassed by those grown anywhere else. The products of the orchards and gardens of the state have advantages and superiority not found in other sections. Horticulture is comomnly thought of as dealing only with flowers and fruits. This is a mistaken notion of the term. Webster defines Horticul - ture as the "art of cultivating orchards, and gardens." Orchards are fruit gardens. A garden is designated as "cultivated ground." Horticul - ture in its true sense means the art of cultivating and caring for tree fruits, small fruits, vineyards, flowers, ornamental shrubs, trees and plants, nut trees and all kinds of vegetables. Taking the horticultural by-products into consideration we find that there is no home which does not depend upon horticulture for, at least, a part of their food. Almost all our citizens, either rural or urban, depend on horticulture for beautify - ing their homes. Considered from either an economic or aesthetic stand - point, horticulture is as important as any industry that exists in the state today. The potential possibilities for increasing the wealth of Nebraska by developement, are greater in horticulture, than in any other line of agricultural endeavor. Every section of the state has its opportunities for some phase of horticultural developement. The past three or four years have been blessings in disguise to the fruit growers of the state. Neglect has been the rule in growing fruit in Nebraska, and as a consequence a large rumber of orchards that should be in their prime are dying or already dead. A large number of orchards are still in good growing condition, but need cleaning up and given good care. Those men who gave their orchards good care have suffered very small loss and have been receiving crops in these years of adverse weather. The adverse weather conditions have demonstrated that Neb - raska can produce profitable crops of fruit, flowers and vegetables where proper cultural methods are followed. Geographic location and high quality of fruit are advantages possessed by Nebraska which are destined keeping qualities to those grown in any of the far famed apple sections of the United States. We cite a few examples, that have been brought to our attention, to show what is being done in the production of fruit in Nebraska. Mr. G. W. Beavers, of South Omaha, Neb., owns a twenty acre farm </seg>
            <seg id="p156">156 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE five and a half miles southwest of that city. During the years 1912, 1913 and 1914, he has harvested from sixteen acres of orchard sixteen years of age and two acres eight years of age, a total of 16,000 bushels of apples which have sold for over twelve thousand dollars. Weaver Bros, of Falls City, bought an orchard eleven miles northeast of their home in the winter of 1912 and '13. The orchard was one of the ordinary type of neglected orchards, unpruned and with a heavy growth of weeds and brush between the trees. They cleaned up the orchard and followed with thorough cultural methods. The first season they harvested twelve hundred barrels of apples from the 28 acres. In 1914 the crop was in the neighborhood of thirty-two hundred barrels. The orchard has paid for itself at $125. per acre and owes the new owners nothing. Shubert Bros, of Shubert are large growers who have demonstrated the possibilities of commercial apple culture in eastern Nebraska. Small fruit has paid large sums per acre where proper care has been given; strawberries being one of the leaders. Mr. J. S. Furnas of Brown - ville, (son of former honored Secretary of this Board, R. W. Fumas. now deceased,) produced and sold $700. worth of strawberries from one acre one season. The Pollard orchard at Nehawka has provided thousands of barre choice apples in the past and bids fair to do so again. The bea evergreens and the fine orchard adds a charm to the landscape ar or what intelligent planting and care will do in Nehawka. Tree fruits other than apples have given good returns when properly located. Grapes are making an excellent showing. An instance of a grape crop that is worthy of mention was produced near Lincoln. In 1911, some business men of Lincoln, believing in the future of grape growing in this section of the state, formed the Grandview Orchards &amp; Vineyards Co. They bought a tract of land north of Lincoln, on which was growing a bearing orchard and one acre of grapes. The grapes had been set about twenty-nine years and had been badly neglected. The first year after the purchase, owing to a large amount of work to be done, the vineyard was not given much care. In the spring of 1913, the owners desired to pull it out and set to some other crop, but the manager persuaded them to let him clean it up and see what it would do. He renovated it thoroughly and as a result, the crop in 1913 netted the owners $116. per acre after all expenses of cultivation and marketing had been deducted. Up near Arlington, in Washington county, there is a vineyard which is 50 years old, and is still producing profitable crops. In the past fifteen yf ars there has never been a complete failure. Near Florence are found numerous vineyards that are bringing in around $100. per acre each year. Antelope county is not heralded abroad as a fruit county, yet Caldwell &amp; Shrews n«&gt;ar Elgin, have a large commercial orchard which is producing profi f able crops each year. Going west in the state, we find several hrttane** «f commercial orcharding that have been successful. At Geneva in Fillmore county, the </seg>

At McCook, in Red Willow county, Mr. W. S. Morlan, an attorney at aw, has demonstrated that apples, plums and cherries are profitable crops )w. His apple orchard has been producing profitable crops each year e David Hunter orchard of twenty-six acres at Sutherland, Lincoln ounty, produced fifteen thousand bushels of apples in 1913, and this year 0,000 bushels. At the Nebraska State Fair last fall, there were some apples dis - played from Cherry county, near V'aletine, that were as fine as any shown. The exhibitor stated that the orchard producing this fruit had been a pro- Etble on These are a few samples of commercial fruit growing in the state, erve to show what can be done in a commercial way by the use &gt;per methods. getable growing in Nebraska ranks highest in point of value of any the horticultural mips grown. A major part of the homes of the state eir small vegetable garden where a portion of the vegetable crop produced, and market gardeners near our towns and cities IC have in the aggregate a large acreage devoted to the growing of vege - tables. The vegetable grower, whether in the home garden work or in the larger commercial venture, has some very important problems that he must solve. The agencies in the state engaged in Horticultural work should devote more time to the vegetable growing interests of the state. The home builders of our cities, towns and villages are becoming more and more interested each year in beautifying their homes and the city's streets and parks. Farm owners of the state have reached that de - gree of prosperity where they desire to make their farmsteads more beautiful and homelike. Floriculture and Arboriculture are two branches of horticulture which are necessary to accomplish the results desired. Greater encouragement should be given these branches of Horticulture. Tree planting, whether it be for home decoration, wind-break, or for profit, should be encouraged in every possible way. Every horticultural agency in the state should do all in their power to encourage a more lib - eral and judicious planting of the right kind of trees in the right places. Horticultural conditions throughout the state at present are good. All fruit, trees, vines and plants give promise of a full crop the coming year, weather conditions favoring. Ornamental trees, shrubs and plants are in excellent shape and the outlook for horticultural crops is good. In summing up the situation, the outlook for the developement of horticulture in all of its branches was never brighter. The prospects for the greater developement in fruit growing, vegetable culture, floriculture and arborculture in the state in the next decade, are better than ever before. No other industry can show any greater possibilities for increas - ing the wealth of the state. The following table was takrn from the census of 1910, and is merely </seg>
            <seg id="p158">158 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE an indication of what can be done and not what could be done if the horticulutral resources of Nebraska were developed to their fullest ex - tent. During the period between 1900 and 1910 the increase in value o some of the main items were as follows: Flowers, plants and nursery products increased Small fruits 532,552.00 61,010.00 Tree fruits and nuts 287.00 Other items show a corresponding increase during the same period, When the figures for the next census are taken we will find a greater in - crease than in the above period. There are approximately forty-nine million acres of farm land in Nebraska, and of this amount nearly two million acres can be placed under irrigation. If this amount together with one twentieth of the re - mainder were used in producing some horticulural crop and the value of the crop averaged at $30. per acre it would mean over one hundred and twenty million dollars added to the wealth of the state. The area in eastern Nebraska alone, which could be devoted to horticultural crops approximate this figure. Taking the aesthetic side, which cannot be measured as well as the economic value, the horticultural products of the state would run into the hundreds of millions. This committee feels that this branch of agriculture is one that merits the greatest encouragement in every way possible to foster and develop it. This work is now carried on by two agencies in our state which are doing and have done a good work. Their labors have been sadly handi - capped by a lack of sufficient funds to properly carry on the work. There are several urgent problems that need the earliest solution possible. The problems confronting the commercial fruit growing interests in the state should be given the early attention of these agencies so that the commer - cial fruit growing business of the state may be developed along sound Vegetables, including potatoes and sweet potatoes Flowers, plants and nursery products.— Orchard fruits Small fruits .$6,031,738.00 . 909,221.00 1,932,124.00 159,169.00 Grapes _ Nuts - Cider, 255, 886 gallons Vinegar, 109,593 gallons _ Wine and grape juice, 47,703 gallons Dried fruits, 17,793 lbs. at 5c per pound Beans, (field grown for human consumption) Garden and flower seeds . 137,169.00 8,906.00 51 ,] 72.00 21,818.00 23.861.50 886.65 14,962.00 39,737.00 Total _ - $9,330,764.15 </seg>

An experimental Fruit Farm under the supervision of the Department of Horticulture, where the practical problems confronting tht fruit grower of the eastern part of the state can be solved, should be established at some point in the Missouri river territory. The Board of Rejrents of the State University should establish such a station without leliy. The state now owns several experiment stations that adequately over the central and western part of the state. More work should be dons at these stations to solve the problems that confront the people in the territory adjacent to these stations. There are hundreds of orchards of bearing age in Nebraska that can be renovated and brought into pro - fitable bearing if the owners knew the proper methods. This work should eive the attention of the department of Horticulutre at an early date.

Kl'RAL AND AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION To the President, Secretary and Board of Managers: As members of your committee on rural and agricultural education, we take pleasure in expressing our loyalty to and support of the educa - tional system of our Nation and State. We recognize its importance in training and developing our youth into the highest type of citizenship. We know, however, that our splendid educational system, like everything else worth while must stand the test of criticism if it is to be improved and thus meet the future needs of our people more efficiently, or even as well, as it has met the needs of the past. Many of the criticisms commonly made may be summed up in such phrases as the following: "Lack of skill, lack of thoroughness, too much time devoted to certain subjects on phases of subjects and to non-essen - tials, lack of initiative, etc." Such criticisms are often overdrawn. The critic of the public school should not forget that mere skill in the per - formance of a single operation is due mainly to practice and habit, and that such skill on the part of one who lacks a reasonably broad educa - tional training does not necessarily mean skill and efficiency in a suffi - ciently broad sense — a reasonable adaptability to new situations — to say nothing of a probable lack of ability to take a proper view of many vital </seg>
            <seg id="p160">160 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE problems confronting the individual as a member of society. Yet. we do not hesitate to admit that there is considerable truth in just such criticisms. We recognize, however, that, to be of real value, our criticisms must be constructive and not merely destructive. With this in view, an attempt is here made to point out a few lines of effort which, it is hoped, will tend to correct the defects. Even yet we too often think of elementary and high school work as mainly a preparation for college, or, perhaps for some form of activity in years to come. But the education of the child must be interpreted in terms of the child. We cannot adequately educate the child for the future if we do not understand the laws of child development. School is real life and the school is highly efficient only to the degree in which its work is determined by the highest needs of those being trained in the school, and these needs are determined by the actual conditions of life. Now we all recognize that a man's experience and interests have much to do with his ability to learn readily and well any particular thing, and we also know that his experiences largely determine his interests. A child's intersts are determined by his experiences and these interests are often vitalized and strengthened by motor expression. Thus, the child's actual experiences, interests, and activities are all of vital importance in considering the subject matter to be taught and the methods of teaching the same. The actual doing of any work with things about the child should be made to assist his education. Thus, we recognize the value of nature study and industrial work as a means of vitalizing the child's activities and interests. When the thing attempted is just complex and difficult enough to require reasonable thought and effort, the proper doing of it means mental growth as well as muscular adaptation. But when the intellectual element has no prominent place in the doing of things, because of a failure to base the doing upon the child's real interest?, in - dustrial work falls short of accomplishing its highest purpose. We be - lieve that the value of industrial training is increased in proportion to our willingness and ability to articulate it with home needs, to correlate it with other branches, and to properly emphasize the intellectual element. We believe, for example, that the highest purpose of domestic science in elementary education is not to make expert cooks (although it may helpi, but to make use of this vital subject in the child's experience as a logical and valid basis of a portion of the important subject of hygiene and physiology. An extensive theoretical investigation of the art of coding might be a source of pleasure to the student but it would be useless without the experience of putting into practice the lessons learned; and likewise the practical experience of learning how to do things without knowing the reasons for doing them would be soon forgotten. Habits of cleanliness, promptness, order ond regularity should be based upon a pre-supposed thorough knowledge of the reasons for these requirements; hence we </seg>
            <seg id="p161">161 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE &gt;elieve that in domestic science and similar lines of educational work, the heoretical and the practical should go "hand in hand." Woodworking, gardening, field crops, farm animals, harmful and l&gt;eneficial insects and plants, machinery, etc., are all subjects of vital interest and importance to the children of the farm and some of them are of equal importance to city children. Children are interested in them and their interest becomes keener and more vital as it is properly en - iouraged and directed by parents, teachers and other associates. Such interests as these, we maintain, should be made the real basis of much of [&gt;ur school work. In other words, much of the arithmetic, language and -■polling should be the result of work with and a study of such things. This means a certain change of emphasis, a re-direction of our educational efforts. The farmer knows that he can best teach his boy how to discover the capacity of the wagon box or granary by having him see and measure these very things. He teaches him about the pests and diseases of field and garden crops by showing them to him and by having him take a lively interest in combating them. Together they use bulletins and books as sources of information and direction, but after their interests have been established rather than before; that is, their book work becomes positively purposive. This is vitalized teaching and illustrates our mean- ing when we say that such knowledge and work as this should be so or - ganized by educators that both teachers and school patrons will recognize its importance in the educational process. Such an emphasis upon vital things points out to parents their opporunity to assist vitally in the edu - cation of their children, since the farm, the garden and the work shop are recognized as educational laboratories. It also brings the school and the home into a proper vital relation with each other. We believe rural teachers should be familiar with country life and we approve the recommendation of the School Law Revision Commission and the Farmer's Congress for better training of rural teachers for their work. We beiieve that a portion of their required training should be devoted to a course in applied elementary science, including especially botany, physics and zoology. We recognize, however, the importance of science training for city teachers as well as for rural teachers. We feel that our over crowded courses of study and daily programs in the upper grades of our elementary schools are largely the result of a failure to eliminate obsolete work as well as a failure to correlate sub - jects taught. If, for example, as the child is learning to read, he is read - ing something worth while and if he is acquiring and making use of arithmetical skill while he is stuyding other branches logically involving arithmetical processes, he will not be required to spend a stated time each day for eight school years in the study of each of these branches for its own sake Thus, a closer correlation of subjects taught will make it possible to reduce the daily recitation periods for each grammer grade from eight or more to a reasonable and pedagogical number. </seg>
            <seg id="p162">162 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE We approve of a wider use of school buildings, by making them social centers for the expression of the best thought and entertainment of their respective communities. We favor rural high schools, and we also urge upon town and city schools of Nebraska a recognition of the fact that, in many instances, their schools will be made to serve their own students better by offering more work in agriculture and nature study closely allied to it. This is true, we believe, because agriculture is so broad a subject that many of its basic principles are vital to both city and rural people. Finally, we believe that the State Board of Agriculture can assist in promoting the foregoing enunciations of principles by adhering to the following plan of activities: First, that the rural teachers be encouraged to make their work more practical and intensive rather than so theoretical and extensive and that school board be requested to be patient with teachers who undertake to accomplish these re Second, that the State Fair A ults sociation be urged to contir )ffer special inducements to teachers, schools and pupils who make creditable exhibits of work at the State Fair. We are of the opinion that these dis - plays should consist of pictures of buildings with interior and exterior views, fixtures and improvements, grounds and gardens, photograhps of teachers and pupils who have accomplished unusually good work or have introduced new and acceptable innovations of whatsoever nature; and in fact, everything pertaining to the school that will make teachers and pupils more studious, careful, inventive or thorough; and that the best of these exhibits be published in an Annual Album of School Scenes. Third, that County Superintendents be induced to hold, annually, at the County Seat, a school fair or general school exhibit of the accomplish - ment of the various schools of the county for the year and that from these exhibits materials be gathered for the State Fair. Fourth, believing that it will be as profitable to the state to produce a hardy, intellectual and industrious class of boys and girls as it is to develop the higher grades of stock or farm produce; Therefore, we suggest that the expense of the school fairs described above should be met by appropriation out of the general funds of the county, and that a statutory enactment to this effect should be passed. Fifth, we strongly favor the rural high school in communities where conditions make it possible to maintain the same. In support of this most important rural school problem, we wish to quote from a recent address delivered by Secretary Mellor of the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture at Minneapolis, Minn., in which he says: "One of the outstanding results of education of our children away from home and the farm is that it takes 95 out of every 100 students away from the rural districts to professions and town activities, thus depleting the educational value which we are all seeking to impart to our farm life, which might counteract the lure of the city.

This city experience is such a change from his prior quiet existence on the farm, and the teach - ings received all tending toward the social life and glamour of a populated center, that he naturally desires to become a permanent part of his new existence and straightway begins to explore the field of professions or business. He may decide to complete a course in the Agricultural College and when such course is completed, he finds opportunity in the scientific departments of government, state or county which effectually bind his residence to the city." We commend the officers and managers of the State Board of Agri - culture for their successful efforts in making the Nebraska State Fair both interesting and broadly educational. Really interesting, however, because it is educational. E. R. PURCELL, Chairman. J. H. TAYLOR. W. B. BANNING W. A. YODER T. C. GRIMES. REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON DAIRYING W.

A number of other phases of the dairying industry could be treated in the same way. Respectfully submitted, JACOB SASS. Chairman. REPORT OF POULTRY COMMITTEE W. R. Mellor, Secretary State Board of Agriculture Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: Your committee, selected to 'ook into poultry conditions in the state beg leave to report as follows: During the year 1914 we find that the egg and poultry industry pro - duced more than forty millions of dollars. As compared with the impor - tance of the value of poultry to the people of the state we believe that this industry is receiving scant attention. Trained poultry experts are hard to find. We commend this line of work to young men who are seeking to advance themselves in practical agriculture. Competent judges are in demand from nearly all our county fairs. In Red Willow county it was impossible to secure the services of such judges and the fair management was embarrased as a resu We urge the establishment of a poultry department at the state farm at the earliest possible date. We believe that this is a pressing questior which should receive attention at once from our legislaure and board ol regents. Millions of dollars are lost each year to the poultry growers o Nebraska because of careless feeding, unscientific housing, lack of fatter ing the fowls and the conditions in which they market their fowls. In the handling of the eggs, marked advances have been made. This subject has received considerable attention in the public press and the agitation has had a wholesome effect. The importance of immediate action in this matter can hardly be exaggerated. For instance, the expert advice on housing poultry would eliminate many ailments which annually cause the death of myriads of fowls. Model chicken houses, providing light, proper heat and wholesome ventilation, are no more expensive than the structures usually erected. In a like manner, the selection of .stock, the feeding of the fowls am) the marketing of the poultry products should be carefully explained in bulletins. If this can be done the poultry industry can be doubled in this state within a short period and in the opinion of your committee, there is no other industry which will yield- returns so quickly to the farmer.

            <seg id="p165">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 165 REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON GOOD ROADS the State Board of Agriculture: We, your committee on Good Roads are glad to be able to report that the interest in better highways is increasing. We congratulate the citi - zens of our state on the progress being made. We especially commend the work of the several counties in the construction of bridges and cul - verts. The day of the cheap wooden culverts has gone by, "cheap" to be sure in the first cost but when durability and risk of danger are taken into account, one of the most expensive. Most of the counties are now jilding of concrete and iron. While this committee is not especially a legislative committee, never - theless, we find that laws recently passed are proving their worth and we believe the state is ready for greater advance along road lines. Many of our counties are having at least a part of their roads systematically dragged. A more general use of the drag will no doubt be made in the future as no county adopting the system of patrolling its roads will return to the old methods. Several counties have availed themselves of the Road Commissioner Law. That this method of road administration is a success may be inferred from an extensive article by L. S. Herron in the Nebraska Farmer of December 9, 1914. Among other things, he says: "Maybe irood live commissioners and overseers, without an engineer could have brought Polk county roads to their present condition. "But after careful inspection of the roads in Polk and adjoining counties, I am convinced that the connection between the roads in Polk county and the county highway engineer, is close and logical. Some of the counties in the state may not be able to employ continuously a road engieer. Some provision might be made whereby such counties could have the advice and service of the office of the state engineer as all counties now have in the matter of ridges and culverts. We are of the opinion that the automobile license tax law should be amended in such a manner as to make the collection of this tax sure. The license should be based on the size of the machine. This can best be done by a tax graduated according to the listed horse-power of the car. Iowa has a law of this character. The money collected by the automobile tax should be turned into the road fund and used for dragging or otherwise maintaining the roads in usable condition. Some method should be devised to popularize the use of convicts in the construction and maintenance of the highways. Our law (Statutes, 7320-21) is adequate for this purpose, and if put into practice much good would result to the convict and to the road. There is no better employ - ment for convicts than that of a public character. The imprisoned man has sinned against society; by doing work which indirectly redounds to the benefit of society and not to some individual or firm he sees that he is paying his just fine; he is, in a measure, recompensing society for his own wrongdoing, he is learning that virtue is its own reward, his moral char - acter is being strengthened, and the result is on the whole reformatory and uplifting rather than brutalizing and degrading. </seg>
            <seg id="p166">166 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Mr. Ward Newcomb, clerk of Clay county, has compiled the 1913 tax levies of Nebraska counties for all county purposes. In the table which follows columns I, II, III and IV are taken from his compilation; these we have divided by the number of miles of roads in each county (column V) taken from Bulletin No. 41, office of Public Roads, U. S. Department or Agriculture, and thereby secured the remaining columns. We do not vouch for extreme accuracy in these data; in some coun - ties evidently the mileage is based upon the number of sections, in others on the actual number of miles used as public roads. But they are the best that we have at this time and may serve as a basis of thought. The amount of money spent upon roads and upon bridges is about equally divided, being $20.80 to $19.40 per mile of road respectively. The counties having the highest levies for roads and bridges are: Douglas, $275.50; Sarpy, $95.40; Nance, $103.70; Polk, $93.40; and Dodge, $86.30. Those having the least levies are: Grant, nothing; Banner, $1.10; Garfield, $6.60; Lincoln, $7.20; and Hayes, $7.40. The outline map shows graphically the It appears to your committee that it might be possil Jte to the cause of good roads by providing an educational exhibit of Neb - raska roads at the State Fair. For the present it could take the form of a wall exhibit largely of photographs of good and bad roads in the state; photograph of state aid bridges; blue prints of bridge plans, culverts, road cross-sections, road signs and marks. There might be a display of road maps, transcontinental and county with suggestions for connecting up the several road systems. A placard hung in a conspicuous place in the exhibit might mention the names and locations on the grounds of all ex - hibitors of road machinery and materials. And finally, a collection of Nebraska road materials could be added. Respectfully submitted, L. H. CHENEY. Chairman G. R. CHATBURN, Secretary. E. GLADFELTER T. B. KEEDLE C. H. GUSTAFSON •For example, Cherry county, the largest county in the state is only credited in the government bulletin with 311 miles of road; this no doabt raises unduly the amount per mile. •elative levies in the several counties for roads and bridges per mile &lt; ■oad. The scant information at hand shows that grading earth roads cos' 'rom $35 to $50 per mile, sand-clay construction, $800 to $1200; macada ind concrete, $5000 to $8000; bituminous and brick, $8000 to $12000. Tl igures are very indefinite; only a few counties keep cost data on roi work. The cost of grading in Polk county in 1911 averagred $84.25 p&lt; nile; in 1912, $45.00; 1913, $45.00; and in 1914, $43.00. The average co &gt;f dragging in this county is $6.00 per mile per annum at 50 cents per mi 'or each dragging. </seg>

            <seg id="p279">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 279 THE DEVELOPEMENT OF NEBRASKA'S SANDHILL AREAS By G. E. Condra, Director of the State Conservation and Soil Survey, The University of Nebraska The sandhill country should be more generally understood by citizens of the state. It has some interesting features, and presents a number of conservation problems of considerable importance. Progress attained by State and Federal Surveys makes it now possible to present data regarding the various sandhill areas. The boundaries have been deter - mined and some detailed mapping has been finished within the hills proper. To accurately map and describe all of the small features, such as basins, valleys and hills will require much time. Position and Area. The map, figure 1, shows the distribution of sandhills in Nebraska. The largest area, known as the Sandhill Region, has an extent of about 18,440 square miles, including the Merriman-Cody and Rush Creek areas north of the Niobrara. Four outliers occur in the High Plains Region. They are on the Ainsworth, Springview, Box Butte, and Perkins County tables. The Newport area, on the Ainsworth table of Rock and Holt Counties, has an extent of about 162 square miles, much of which is not typical sandhill land. The Springview area occupies about 324 square miles in Boyd, Keya Paha and Cherry counties. Some of this also is not well denned sandhills. The hills on Box Butte Table are scattered in Sioux County with an extent of about 174 square miles. The Perkins County areas are scattered and small, occupying about 63 square miles. They reach some distance into Chase County. There are about 86 square miles of sandhill land in the North Platte and Pumpkin valleys, making it all about 809 square miles in the High Plains Region. The Dundy County area, 684 square miles, and the Lincoln County area, 522 square miles, are along the boundary betwen the Table Land and Loess Regions. Much of the land within their boundaries is low hills covered with quite stable soil. Sandhills occur at a number of places in the Loess Region, as along the Republican, 10 square miles; in the northern part of Phelps, Kearney and Adams Counties, 54 square miles; south of the Loup between Boelus and Columbus, 126 square miles; northwest of Broken Bow, 32 squar« miles; in the Middle Loup Valley above Sargent, 52 square miles; and as small patches on the Elkhorn and Platte valleys, about 26 square miles, making a total of 294 square miles. The extent of the Sandhill Region and all of the outlying areas is about 20,749 square miles. Some of this, is alluvial, rough atony, and table land of which 324 square miles occurs along the Niobrara and its tributaries. The other valleys, as those of the Loup, Birdwood and Bine- </seg>

            <seg id="p281">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 281 water have about 476 square miles of non-sandhill land, which, added to that of the Niobrara, makes 800 square miles in the region. Deducting this amount from the 20,749 square miles there is left 19,951 square miles of hill, basin, valley, marsh and lake, which is not far from correct. Land Forms and Classification — Viewing the sandhills, as from the table lands on the west, they appear to rise up in rugged fashion above the general level. They resemble in some respects the side view of a mountain range though on a smaller scale. The view from some high point in the hills is broad and billowy, modified at placet by flat valley floors. The sandhills are well named, yet many persons wrongly use the term. These hills are composed of loose materials shaped by wind, and thus stand in contrast with the sandstone and rock hills eroded from bed rock. Sandhills vary greatly in form and size, and usually are grouped in ranges between which occur well defined valleys. The larger land forme are ranges and valleys. The type form is the hill which may contain blowouts. The origin of the sandhill areas has been worked out with consider - able detail. The agencies which produced them have acted from Tertiary times to the present, though the surface is more stable and fixed now than during former times. Structure, wind and vegetation were impor - tant factors in developing the various areas from sandy deposits which were susceptible to easy wind erosion. Being in the path of quite strong westerly winds the sediments or source materials were moved eastward, veering between southeast and northeast depending on the season. Tertiary deposits, plains, loess, alluvial terraces and the flood plains of streams all yielded sediment for sandhill formation, and we now find differences in the forms constructed from each of these sources as well as in the stage of development. Vegetation was the protecting and bind - ing agency during all the time involved in the breaking down of the original deposits and the construction of the hill forms. The plants finally stabilized the soil except under the most unfavorable conditions. A shallow water table held erosion above its level, being in that respect a contributing factor of no small importance. Now as to the land classification. The grouping depends on the basis used, whether according to origin, topography or utilization. As has been shown, the forms are hills, ranges and valleys. The hills are used princi - pally for grazing and the valleys for hay production and fanning. So the two main divisions are grazing land and hay land. The sandhills produce some trees at places, but should not be classed as forest land. Soil Resources. Many persons think of these areas as waste land, somewhat like a desert. Such a conception is erroneous for there are several kinds of soil. Those with largest distribution are dunesand, sandy loam of the hills, basin and dry valley, wet meadow, and marshes. The principal content of each of these is fine sand. </seg>
            <seg id="p282">282 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE LEGEND DRY VALLEYS | | DUNE SAND \mM Fig. 2. Dime Sand Soil in Sandhill Region </seg>
            <seg id="p283">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 283 Dune Sand Soil. This covers approximately two-thirds of the areas. It forms hills and is therefore broken. At places the surface is eroded and scarred by wind, but as a rule the ground is covered with vegetation. In some situations the type occupies nearly all of the land over wide areas, whereas in others it gives way to other soils nearly exclusively (Figure 2). Dune sand is grayish, and has a loose structure. It is composed of fine to medium grained sand and a small percentage of silt and clay. The humus content is low. There is not much difference between the soil and subsoil except that the surface has a little more organic matter. The subsoil is deep as a rule. The dune sand was developed by the weathering, erosion and trans - portation of sandy deposits. The hills, 20 to 100 feet high, represent the land forms constructed by wind acting under the influences of protecting vegetation. The type produces thin to thick stands of grass which is utilized principally for grazing. There are within the areas usually mapped as dune sand many patches of basin soil too small to map. The mechanical analysis of dune sand, according to the United States Bureau of soils, follows: Fine gravel, 0.0%; coarse sand, 0.7%; medium sand, 7.7%; fine sand, 73.7%; very fine sand, 15.2%; silt, 0.7%; clay, 1.9%. Sandy Loam Soil, Hilly Phase. This type occurs in the Dundy and Lincoln County areas and is developed to a less extent at other places as in northern Phelps, Kearney and Adams counties. The topography and soil differ in certain respects from the usual sandhills and their dune sand. The hills are lower and the soil is more stable, containing a slightly larger amount of clay. The soil is dark gray to yellowish brown and it contains more organic matter than occurs in the dune sand. Fully half of the Lincoln County area is of this type and nearly as large a per - centage of the Dundy County area is of the same kind. This soil supports a thick stand of valuable grasses, more so than occurs on the dune sand. Some of the type is sucessfully farmed. Basin and Dry Valley Soil. This type is a brownish, loamy sand occurring in the small pockets and basins among the hills, and on dry valley floors. Only at wet times is the surface covered with water, if at all, and then for a short time only. The extent of this type varies in different areas. It is greatest in the southern part of the main region where he water table is low. The individual basins vary much in size. Usually the valleys are narrow and discontinuous differing in this respect from the wet valleys. This type contains a quite high percentage of organic matter. It consists mainly of fine to medium sand 6 to 18 inches deep. The surface soil is coherent and resistant to wind erosion but becomes less stable under cultivation. In its natural condition the type supports a thick stand of grasses, for grazing or hay production. Some of it is farmed. </seg>

            <seg id="p285">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 285 Wet Meadow Soil. This occurs on the nearly flat and therefore poorly drained valleys. Its largest distribution is in Cherry, northeastern Deuel and northwestern Garden counties. The type is composed of fine to very fine sand into which is incorporated well decayed organic matter. The color is dark gray to black. The surface soil has a depth of 10 to 24 inches, below which the subsoil consiists of fine sand of light color. Except for the larger amount of organic matter and finer particles, the content of this type is about the same as for dune sand. The water table lies close to the surface of the soil, causing an abun - dant production of meadow grasses and sedges. The type is utilized to some extent for grazing, but more largely in the production of hay. A considerable amount is farmed, especially bo where drainage has been perfected. The extent of this soil type is not known. At places it occupies more than half the surface. In other localities its distribtuion is very limited. Marsh Land Soil. Associated with the lakes, occuring on the sidt from which they may receive seepage, and developed in a smaller waj along some of the streams of the region is a well defined marsh land. I 1 is covered with water much of the time, but becomes partly exposed an dry periods. The type includes a great deal of organic matter, making] it much like a muck at places. The economic importance is small except) where the soil is reclaimed by drainage. Drainage Reclamation. It was found, a few years ago, that hay pro - duced on wet ground did not have as high feeding value as that of the; dry valleys. So to correct this condition, and to reclaim marshes and* lake beds for hay production and farming, several valleys were drained; We do not know how much land has been improved this way, yet the. acreage is quite large. Such drainage has been installed in most counties where wet meadows and marshes occur. j Water Resources. The water of most importance in the hills is that which occurs in the soil, and in the ground below the water table. The rainfall is nearly all absorbed by the porous soils. In places, however, on the hills where the texture is finer than usual, there is a noticeable run-off after a heavy down pour. Just what percentage of the rainfall is passed to underground storage and how much is lost by evaporation, has not been definitely determined. Absorption and percolation are quite rapid in the hill soils, carrying much of the water below the plants and influence of evaporation. Everywhere in the hills, though, is moist soil, a few inches below the surface, even at direct times of the year. Lakes. The water of the many hills levels up under the influence of gravity giving a well defined under flow toward the valleys and lower land. Where the valley floors and basins dip below the water table, the ground water covers them, making lakes and marshes. The seepage into these lakes comes from the direction of the higher ground, usually to the </seg>

            <seg id="p287">287 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE west. There is an increase and decrease in depth and size or lakes at wet and dry periods. This year the lakes are swollen, having encroached upon the marshes and bordering hay land. It is safe to conclude that the stor - age of water in the sandhills and in the lakes of the region is greater now than it has been at any time for many years. This will require several months for drainage to reduce the water table to its normal level. Rain - fall, evaporation and drainage affect the lake levels. The exact number of lakes can not be determined because many of them are intermittent in character due to the rise and fall of the water table by the method just described. The number of permanent lakes is very large reaching into the hundreds and thousands. Some of these such as Enders, Big Alkali, Red Deer, Hackberry, Blue and Crescent are well known. The lakes are shallow, 3 to 6 feet deep, as a rule. They differ greatly in size and quality of water. Some are quite heavily alkalied while others show a mineralization low enough to permit the growth of plants and fish. Several of the lakes have been studied by per - sons from different Departments of the University, co-operating with the Conservation and Soil Survey. The investigations have been extended along two lines, namely, in a study of chemical composition of the water, showing the kinds and amounts of mineral matter present, and in a study of the plant and animal life. A few of the lakes and beds thereof have been found to have enough potash to insure economic production. Many of the lakes have an abundance of fish food. The lakes afford part of the water supply of ranches and have some importance in fish culture, boating and hunting. Well Water. There is an abundance of shallow water throughout the areas. It is of good quality except where alkalied. In such places wells must be extended to deeper sources. Artesian water occurs in many places in the Sandhill Region at depths between 40 and 500 feet. Many shallow wells occur in the east - ern part and at points along the upper courses of the North and Middle Loups. Artesian wells 300 to 500 feet deep occur north and northeast of Hyannis. The water of the artesian wells comes from sandy layers below silty beds. Further prospecting may show that artesian water can be obtained in a considerable part of the region. Streams and Water Power. There are few streams in the hills proper, due principally to the obliteration of old drainage ways by drift - ing sands. A very good example of this is Snake Creek, sooth ef Alliance which formerly joined Blue Creek north of Oshkosh. Sandhills developing along the middle course of this valley nearly filled the chan - nel and valley. At wet periods the surface drainage now passes from Snake Creek through the hills by way of Crescent Lake to Blue Creek. The Dismal, Middle Loup, North Loup, Calamus, Gordon, Boardman and Snake River have kept their channels open but the tributaries were des- </seg>
            <seg id="p288">288 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Lake Scene in Sandhills. </seg>
            <seg id="p289">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 289 troyed. At wet periods when the water table is high the lakes are largest, the drainage of the wet valleys becomes better defined in chan - nels. At such times it is possible to trace out such streams as the Boanlman, Gordon and Bluewater to their sources. The valleys are so many depressions into which the ground water escapes in the form of springs making streams with steady flows and a large run-off. The Niobrara crossing the northern part of the Sandhill Region is joined by many spring fed streams. Of these the principal ones are Rush Creek, Pine Creeks, Snake River, Schlagle. Gordon Creek, Min - nechaduza, MacFarland and Plum Creek. These streams have an un - usually even flow throughout the year. They gatheer from the hills a very large run-off, more than occurs in other parts of the state. The Niobrara is a small stream in western Nebraska but it rapidly increases in volume in its sandhill course. Snake River alone doubles the flow, adding about 500 second feet of water. The Niobrara is in some respects the state's best river for power. Its principal drawback is the distance from large cities and markets of the state. Snake River tributary of the Niobrara has five waterfalls and many rapids. Four of the falls occur at a point about 25 miles southwest of Valentine. The water drops over bed rock, falling about 23 feet at one place. Here power could be developed at a relatively small cost if it could be utilized. Powers have been installed in several spring fed streams of the Niobrara system. One of these is in the Minnecha - duza north of Valentine and another is in Plum Creek northwest of Ainsworth. The water of Plum Creek comes from sandhill sources. The Cornell Project developing in the Niobrara four miles east of Valentine one of the largest projects under way in the state. The Loup Rivers receive most of their flow from the sandhills, mak - ing them steady and of value for power development. These streams have power developments in several locations. They could be much more generally utilized. The Beolus Project, now constructing, is to divert the Middle Loup across bottom and bench land and drop it into the South Loup, generating aproximately 3,000 horse power. The dis- cussion which has been under way for some time and relating to the development of power in the Loup between St. Paul and Columbus has a direct bearing on the water resources of the sandhills, because most of the water comes from the hills country. The Loup, as it occurs above Columbus, has an unusually strong an deven flow. It could be the basis of big power projects costing millions of dollars. A favorable aspect of this location is its nearness to cities and markets. Native Plant Resources. No part of our state is more richly en - dowed with native plant life than the sandhill country in which grasses are the chief plant resource. They form a well defined prairie province. The number of species of grass is large and their growth and life habits are such as to afford grazing throughout the year. The soil </seg>

            <seg id="p291">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 291 types, exposures of the hills and the moisture conditions influence th« distribution and the condition of growth of the plant species. There is a rich flora in many of the lakes, especially so in those not heavily al - kalied. Here are myriads of fresh water algae and related forms which become food for low kinds of aquatic animals and finally of importance in fish culture. Pond lilies grow in the lakes, and the marshes support a variety of water loving plants such as bull rushes, wild rice, flags and reed grass. Smartweeds grow profusely on the beds of intermittent lakes. Salt grass occurs on the alkali flats bordering some of the lake* and marshes. The wet meadows produce thick stands of long stemmed grasses and sedges. The dry valleys and basins have some of these, and short grasses. Out on the wind-swept hills, the struggle of the grasses and shrubs is intense. Wind erosion and evaporation are the agencies which hold {he plants in check. The most favorable locations of the hills are on the north and east exposures. Erosion is greatest on the west and evaporation on the south exposure. The hills rise high above the water table and this is another factor in distribution. In consequence of the conditions just cited, the grasses are caused to thin out upward on the slopes and to show differences in density on the various expos - ures. The windward sides and the south exposures with their high evap - oration support the least vegetation and afford the most barren views. Views of the leeward sides and north slopes, show very little bare ground at most places. Not only have the hills passed through stages of development but plants also show a well defined cycle of growth conditions. There seems to be a natural order which they follow in the invasion and fix - ation of hills. Starting with barren slopes the first plants which come onto them are such as blowout grass, the yucca and bunch grasses. These make it possible for others to follow until finally the short grasses, such as gramma, and perhaps buffalo grass may occupy the surface. In this we see the development of a natural resource. So grazing differs widely at various parts of the hills, due to conditions of the grasses. There is a succession of changes in the plant life of the takes due to changing conditions in the depth and border land. At places where the land is filling in, the meadow conditions move onto the ground occupied by the marsh and the marsh encroach upon the lake proper. There is also the opposite development at places. So, lake and wet meadow plant formations are not permently fixed in position. There are many leguminous plants in the hills. Some of these like the shoestring, are woody. The grayish colored sage brush occurs at places. Buck brush and the rose bush are widely distributed. Among the fruits are the sand cherry, wild currants, ground cherries and a few strawberries. Plums, buffalo berries, choke cherries and grapes are also found. Sand cherries, plums and currants have been of </seg>

            <seg id="p293">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 293 most use. The sand cherry named Prunus besseyi, in honor of the man whom we all respect and admire is of especial interest. It is a small bushy plant generally distributed on the hills. Stunted trees of several kinds occur in some pockets of the hills. The red cedar, according to ranchmen formerly grew on the many hill tops. It is found now at places, mostly on the rough land of valleys. The elms, hackberry, cottonwood, oak, willows, ironwood and dog - wood are in some of the valleys and they seem to be advancing hillward. The western yellow pine occurs on the rough stony land and to some extent on the sandy soil bordering the main stream valleys. Korestat'ion. Several years ago pines were planted on the Bruner Ranch in Holt county. They grew to quite large size and made a good stand on typical sandhill ground. The results of this private experi - ment were brought to the attention of the Forestry Department of the federal government and finally certain reserves were set aside for ex - perimental planting. A nursery was started near Halsey. Much diffi - culty was experienced with diseases which attacked the plants in the nursery. The transplants did not thrive as well as some had expected because of a lack of knowledge as to culture methods. Notwithstand - ing these drawbacks, and other discouragements, the reserve at Halsey has succeeded in growing trees on a considerable acreage. The tree most used in this connection are the western yellow pine. It thrives quite well under sandhill conditions. It is known that the hills could be forested but very few claim that it could be done economically. At many places on the valleys throughout the sandhills country cottonwoods, green ash and some other broad-leaved species have been grown to large size within the past 30 years. Some of the best example* of these are between Ainsworth and Brewster. The groves make splen - did windbreaks and supply a considerable amount of firewood. In some places the trees are large enough for saw timber. This success is evi - dence that practically all ranchmen whose buildings are located on val - ley ground, could without much expense, beautify their places by the use of trees. They could also grow windbreaks which would have shelter value. The number of groves is large yet the fact remains that there has been very little planting during the past few years. Whether or not an attempt should be made to forest the sandhills generally is a problem. The country is well suited for grazing. The native grasses are there and under proper management they can be improved. Our state should, however, continue to urge the government to maintain the experiment at Halsey. Bird Life. Among the common birds of the year are meadow larks, the shore lark, vesper sparrow, grasshopper sparrow, bee martin, dove, hawks, grouse and prairie chicken. At and near the lakes and marshal are kill deers, ducks, coots, terns, gulls and blackbirds. It will not be possible here to list the many birds. </seg>
            <seg id="p294">294 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Mammals. Among these are the Jack rabbit, the cotton tail, prairie dot;, mice of several kinds, rat, muskrat, pocket gopher, ground mole, ground squirrel, mink, skunk, badger, civet cat, weasel, raccoon and coyote. Fish and Game. The number of persons going to the lakes and hills for fishing and hunting is increasing. So there may be in this the possibility of furthering a new line of development. The older ranch men tell us that sun fish were in the lakes at an early date and that the streams leading out from the hills contained the common fish. Conditions have been improved in the lakes and streams by stocking. Bass fishing became very good at several lakes and remained so until this year, many fish having been killed by freez - ing last winter. The present situation should be only temporary for a number of the lakes are well suited to fish culture due to an abundance of natural fish food. Formerly deer, elk, antelope and bison occurred in great numbers in these areas. One of the best elk ranges of our country is said to have been along Dismal River. Antelope, bison and elk have disappeared from the region but a few deer remain under protection by ranchmn. Present day game includes rabbits, the raccoon, ducks, grouse, and prairie chicken. The cotton tail is increasing in numbers and the Jack rabbit seems to be decreasing. Raccoons are found along the ravines and in the pockets and marshes. Prairie chickens are most plentiful in the eastern part of the region. The grouse are found more to the westward. Ducks and coots nest in the hills in large numbers, yet older ranchmen say formerly there were many more, and that geese were plentiful. It seems now that with the necessary restriction and protection the number of water fowl breeding in these parts of our state should be greatly increased, thus affording good hunting. Development of Cattle Raising. The first development of the cattle industry came with the driving northward over the Texas Trail of the Spanish longhorns. This was started soon after the Civil War. Two things favored the northern range, viz: the fattening forage, and the Union Pacific with its connecting lines of railroad to the big eastern markets. The northern grasses, as in the sandhills, were found to have grazing value greater than those in Texas. So grazing spread over the Great Plains to Kansas, Nebraska and beyond. At first mature cattle were moved northward and wintered one or two seasons before market - ing. Later, breeding stuff was brought in for the ranches which began occupying the open range. So the sandhills were first stocked with long, thin longhorns from Texas. At one time most of these were shipped in on railroads. The cattle, after fattening on the range, were moved to Chicago, Kansas City and Omaha markets. Cattle from Texas ran their course in Nebraska. They were sap - planted by better beef breeds, but not until much of the range became </seg>
            <seg id="p295">• PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 295 fenced and under more definite management. The shorthorn, hereford and other breeds pushed in from the east. In fact, cattle from this source had been used for draft purposes on the old trails across the state. The first effective move in the way of improvement was the introduction of beef breed bulls. Later whole herds for breeding purposes were intro - duced. The result is that today there are no more highly bred range cattle in any country than occur in the sandhills. The white faced hereford is seen everywhere. Herds of shorthorn, angus, galloways, and red durham polls are also in the sandhills. During the early development of the beef breeds the cattle were required to rustle during winter without hay or shelter. The older range cattle were able to stand almost any exposure and could rustle for feed but the newer breeds needed husbanding. After big losses, the ranchmen began to provide food and shelter. The hills region has an abundance of grass, good water and hay, but it lacks grain which is necessary to finish the cattle, for market. The range does produce the best finished animals for beef, hence many of them go to the corn country for fattening. Consequently the region is gain - ing importance in the production of feeders. The Kincaiderft. For many years the sandhill country was open range, after which permanent ranches were established at advantageous points. Then the hill land was thought to have little value, the valleys having been filed upon. Ranchmen fenced the range about as they wished making large pastures under their control. This made the land more efficient than it had been under the open range conditions, yet it was not right to permit the use of the public domain in that way. It remained for Representative Mose Kincaid to devise a method whereby the hill land could be taken up in 640 acre tracts, making it possible for many homeseekers to enter the region. Soon all the available land was occupied. The experiment carried farming to all parts of the sandhills. The homesteaders who understood stock raising and raised cattle did well, some of them building up ranches. Those without funds tried to farm, some doing so on land poorly suited for such purpose. The Kincaiders did not understand the land and climate. Neither did the federal government and the state put forth much effort in the way of helpful assistance. Many difficulties were encountered. Corn, oats, rye, wheat, alfalfa, vegetables and fruit were the crops moat grown. The great problem has been to hold the soil against wind eros - ion. Though practically all of the land has been filed upon, to date, except scattered tracts of a few acres each, there are fewer people at places in the hills than most people suppose. The homesteader, in most cases, have sold out or wish to sell as soon as title can be conveyed. </seg>
            <seg id="p296">296 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Opening Forest Reserves. One of the forest reserves has been opened to settlement and there is now more or less agitation in favor of opening the others. Much publicity was given the opening of the North Platte Reserve and many more people sought the land than could be accomodated. The total outlay on the part of all concerned was very great and only a few profited thereby. Now, after the land has been occupied by the homesteader, also called Kincaiders, we find that the most of them wish to sell out to the large ranchmen as soon as they can. Others who raise stock are doing well. So we conclude that the results of this opening when viewed as a whole, may not be as helpful to the Sandhill Region and to the general good of the state, as some have supposed. The subject should be thoroughly investigated by the Conservation and Welfare Commission before the other forest reserves are opened. There are those who argue for the throwing open of these lands, and others strongly oppose such procedure. It would seem that in view of the past experience, we should find a more usable and therefore better method of getting this land deeded and into private ownership, if it is necessary so to do. Some claim that the reserves should be held by the federal government because with future advances in agriculture these lands may be found to have great value. Others argue that by the leasing system, now in vogue, the same result can be secured whether the land is owned by the government of by individuals. Most people realize that homesteading will not tend to permanently increase the population of this part of the state. Evidently we should favor the method which will be least wasteful, and will conserve the interests of those who go onto the land and will result in the most efficient utilization. To open the reserves in the old way would bring certain abuses. It would result, however, in private ownership and state taxation. Prob - ably, the government might sell the land in restricted areas to ranchmen within the region and to such other persons as could give the necessary guaranty that they would use it for the purposes for which it is best suited. No large tracts would be disposed of to any person. The land should be sold on favorable terms, probably by the method used in dis - posing of unalloted Indian lands. Large Ranches. There are two leading forms of agricultural develop - ment in the sandhills, and one of these is giving way to the other. They are represented in the Kincaider or homesteader and the big ranchman. Some of the ranchmen started as Kinkaiders. No where in Nebraska and probably at few places in the United States is more concerted effort being made to build up large permanent cattle ranches than we find in this region. The movement has been under way for several years, individuals and companies buying out the Kincaid - ers and combining ranches on a large scale. Some of the holdings now have severs! thousand of acres on which are grown large herds of cattle. The </seg>
            <seg id="p297">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 297 capitalization of some ranches covering land, herds, fences, buildings and equipment reaches as much as a million dollars. These ranches are under the direction of experienced stockmen. They require acreage for summer and winter range and adequate hay land from which feed for winter is derived. All the land owned or controlled by these ranches is fenced and managed according to a definite system. The ranches grow little or no grain. The native sod is not plowed except where vegetables, fruit or a small amount of grain is grown for ranch use. The ranch buildings are modern in a large number of cases, some being electric lighted. So we see in the sandhill country, two widely devergent develop - ments, one looking toward the utilization of the region for farming and carried on by homesteaders without adequate funds and the other, a combination which brings together much land and a big herd of well bred cattle under a single management. Not wishing to discourage the Kincaider, but recognizing the fact that natural conditions influence development, we are bound to conclude that the region must necessarily advance along the line of stock raising and ranching, more than in the line of grain farming. It is the opinion of many that it would be better if the ranch units were not combined on such a large scale. This is in line with the move - ment to decrease the size of industrial units. Others argue for the larger farms and ranches. Forage Improvement. Perhaps the largest conservation problem of the sandhills is forage improvement. The grasses in some localities have too little value. Bunch grass is not desirable. Its old growths stand from season to season ,thus causing the cattle and horses to avoid them. The bluestems and the fattening short grasses make thick stands at many places. They are desirable for grazing purposes. Fires and overgrazing have a tendency to kill out the more desirable grasses and permit the invasion of ground by blowout grass, bunch grass, and the yucca. So the ranchmen must manage the range in a way that will con - serve its best grasses. Fires, sometimes started by lightning, and sweeping the range in the fall time destroy the seed and roots, thus killing the stand. It is claimed, that if properly done at the right time in the spring, after seeding is well established the grazing conditions may be improved by running a fire over land occupied by bunch grass. This destroys the old stems and may kill the roots. Then other grasses are free to invade and cover the ground. One of the largest ranchmen has used this method and by so doing changed the grass cover from that of bunch grass to gramma and buffalo grass. He has added to the efficiency of the range and thereby enhanced the value of his land. Under some conditions, this procedure might do great damage in killing out the only grass that would hold the soil. </seg>
            <seg id="p298">298 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The effects of overgrazing are not fully understood. There are those who think that undergrazing works a harm and that the best results are obtained when the range is grazed rather closely. Just what the fact in this matter really is, we do not know. Practically all of the large ranchmen maintain that the ground should be quite heavily or completely grazed, whereas those in charge of leasing on government reserves hold the opposite view. That the grasses of the hills are developing into a more useful con - dition is evident, and most persons conclude that the chief factor in this has been the absence of big fires, during recent years. The fires do much damage to the lower hill slopes, dry valley and wet meadow grasses. Just how far the forage conditions could be improved by artificial seeding to grasses which should supplant those of less value, we do not know. The experiment deserves more attention than has been given it. A factor which is of value in conserving forage resources of the range ia found in that ranch management which throws the cattle onto fresh range at certain periods during the year, thus leaving the old pastures periods of rest and growth. This favors seed production. Transportation and Markets. Roads in the sandhills began as mere trails. Travel at first was largely on horseback. Then the buggy and wagon came into use for family and freighting. Within the past few years, the auto has reached practically every part of the region giving rapid transit to the various towns and railway points. This is having marked influence on social and industrial conditions. The C. B. &amp; Q., mainline to the northwest, traverse the Sandhill Region. The Nortwestern crosses the northern part. The Union Pacific lies along the southern border. A branch of the Burlington pives an outlet to Denver. Branch lines of the Union Pacific and Burlington extend extend to the southeastern border of the region. The Cheyenne Branch of the Burlington crosses the Lincoln county area and the main line of the Bur - lington to Denver traverses the south border of the Dundy county area. So the railway facilities are well distributed, making it possible to reach the shipping points without much inconvenience. This It in part, because the outward movement of freight is largely in the form of cattle. Hay is shipped from some places. Prevention and Control of Soil Erosion. Though the hill slopes are quite well bound with grasses, there are many places where wind erosion is active. This is most noticeable on the upper hill slopes. At such places pits, called blowouts, are formed and the sand taken therefrom moves onto the leeward slopes burying the vegtation. The wind blown sand abrades the plants and even the deepest rooted vegetation is dis - lodged in the blowouts. Anything which destroys the plant cover tends to start erosion. Examples of such are observed in trails, wagon roads, at wells where </seg>
            <seg id="p299">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 299 there is overgrazing and tramping, and in railroad cuts. Burns may also promote erosion. The exposed soil of plowed ground will make a dense dust cloud on a windy day. So the ranchmen, farmers and railroads have a difficult task in hold - ing the soil in some situations. Among the means used in this conrtol are fences and groves with which to break the force of the wind; a cover of straw or brush, the preventionof overgrazing, and the retention of the crop cover as long as possible. Too often no attempt is made to prevent erosion, nor to check it when started. Conclusions 1. The extent of Nebraska's Sandhill areas is about 19,951 square miles. 2. There are five soil types in the areas proper. Of these dune sand occupies about two-thirds of the surface. 3. The sandhill areas are natural prairies, used principally for grazing. 4. Wet and dry valleys produce much hay. 5. The water supplied from shallow wells, artesian wells, springs, streams and lakes is abundant and of good quality. 6. The grazing lands and hay lands occur in about the right propor - tion to afford both summer and winter feed. Corn, wheat, oats, rye, alfalfa, vegetables and fruit are grown at places. 8. The fish and game resources are of importance. 9. Cattle and horse ranching are developing on a large scale. The cattle ranches are stocked with the best breeds of beef cattle. 10. The ground water of the hills is the source of the state's largest power streams. 11. Among the Conservation Problems are the following: A. Drainage. B. Forestation. C. Development of the fruit, fish and game resources. D. The management and utilization of forest reserves. E. The development of useful grasses. F. The extent, and conditions under which farming should be carried on. G. Prevention and control of soil erosion. 12. The sandhills, the state's greatest grazing country, supple - ments the corn belt in cattle raising. The two regions afford grass, hay, drain and beef. </seg>

With a son and some other stockmen he had left Ohadron that morning to at - tend a stockmen 's convention at Rapid City, and was apparently in good health. After a hearty supper he retired to a room in the hotel at about 9:00 o'clock. At 10 :30, when his son went up to the room, he found him dead in bed. At the time of his death he was the oldest member of the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture, having: been elected to the Board in 1897, and holding con - tinuous membership since. Charles Mann was a settler on a homestead in Chadron Creek Valley in 1884, residing there ever miic". Three married sons live on adjoining farms. Mr. Mann was a landmark ia northwest Nebraska, continuously boosting for his locality. He has held a superintendency at every State Fair held since his first election and was greatly esteemed by each mem - ber of the Board for his kindliness and sterling qual - ities in the execution of his duties. </seg>
