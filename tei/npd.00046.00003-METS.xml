Invocation by the Reverend R. D. Llcklider. Music furnished by the Glee Club of the School of Agriculture. The President: I certainly wish to thank the boys from the School of Agriculture, that they have appeared upon our program, and I wish to congratulate the members of the Society that they will be here at 2 o'clock tomorrow afternoon. The next item that appears up - on this program is the President's address. I suppose that we can place Vice-President Howard in the chair, and he will be able to keep order while I give my address. NEBRASKA'S HORTICULTURE Address of Val Keyser, President of the State Horticulture Society, January. 1917. Fellow members and friends of the State Horticultural Society: It is both a privilege and pleasure to me to have this opportun - ity to talk to you about Nebraska's Horticulture. Our Society is one of the oldest legalized organizations in the State. Upon its membership roll is written the names of men who have claimed high on the ladder of fame. Their contibutions to Horticulture and allied sciences are recognized as fundamental by the scholars of the civilized world. Some of these men are active in the Horticultural progress of today, others have passed to the great be - yond, but have left behind them lessons which will live in the memory of our membership so long as this society shall continue to be an ac - tive organiation. I want the active membership of this society to join me in a solemn pledge that we will put aside all of the little jealousies that may have existed in the past from mere misunderstandings among men and each of us put our shoulders to the wheel, and boost this wagon of Horticulture up the road of progress. There are so many things demanding the future attention of this society that we have no time to worry about the mistakes of the past. The mission of the State Horticultural Society is to promote and encourage all desirable Horticultural activities of Nebraska. Horti - culture is a wonderful big subject. The scholars of this country who have devoted a life study to the subject have found it necessary to di - vide Horticulture into several branches in order that It may be reduced </seg>
            <seg id="p023">23 to teachable form. We find today the specialist in pomology, or fruit growing. The specialist in flora culture. The specialist in landscape gardening, and the expert in Forestry. Each of these divisions of Nebraska Horticulture has a commercial phase and home phase. The opportunity for study and improvement in any of these lines is greater today than ever before. The office of our Society is a bureau of information in which is kept a record of the successes and failure which have attended the Horticultural practice in Nebraska from 47 years ago up to date. A small appropriation is cheerfully given by each succeeding legis - lature which is used in promoting Nebraska Horticulture in every way possible. The success of the Horticultural Society can only be measnred by its service to the State. Our Secretary does not pose as a walking encyclopedia. He is however a man of Horticultural training and stands ready and anxious to furnish through the medium or cor - respondence help suggestions to any one needing advise along Horti - cultural lines. He is in direct touch with the latest Horticultural achievements in America and the people of Nebraska are invited to use this office when in need of helpful suggestions. What are some of the problems of Nebraska's Horticulture which represent themselves at this time? One very important problem Is the commercial potato industry of Northwest Nebraska, which the So - ciety planned to have ably discussed at the Thursday afternoon session of this program. Another is the commercial fruit industry of Southeast Nebraska, about which the Society has had considerable to say at dif - ferent meetings of the past. The writer wishes to call attention to the commercial fruit in - dustry in the Southeast Nebraska. A survey of the orchards in East - ern Nebraska shows that there are approximately 5000 acres of apple trees of bearing age. About 200Q acres produce fruit of merchant - able quality. The other 3000 acres are idling on a job or producing fruit so inferior in appearance and quality that it is of no value to the State or to the individual who grows it. I wonder why it is that one grower produces apples and makes money at the business while his neighbor's orchard does not pay the taxes on the land it occupies. Is it the fault of the trees, the soil or location of the orchard, or could it be possible that some blame rests'on the shoulders of the owner? Should not this Society in co - operation with the Horticultural Department at the University try to discover just where the trouble lies and make it their business to cor - rect it? The season of 1916, Eastern Nebraska produced a little more than 400 cars of apples which were practically all grown as a light crop on about two-fifths of the total acreage of orchards of bearing age in this section. A thousand carg of "Number one apples" would not be a large production for Eastern Nebraska orchards and can </seg>
            <seg id="p024">24 be produced if the State would make it, its business to discover the ex - act cause of lack of production and insist upon a practice which will overcome the difficulty. There is less than a thousand acres of newly planted commercial orchards three years old and under. Gentlemen, it seems to me a problem is here presented in which the legislature and the State not only has a right but a duty to take an active interest. The quality of fruit produced in Eastern Nebraska Is recognized by the consuming public of our State, as fruit is in demand, not the culls and inferior which should be ground into cider or utilized by the canneries, but the good clean merchantable apples that are worth more on the markets today than the same varieties pro - duced in other States of the Union. Our college of Agriculture must preach the gospel of better care for the old orchard and the legislature must give them funds to prac - tice what they preach. The uncared for orchards scattered up and down the river are rapidly succuming to the ravages of unmolested orchard pest and the trees will soon find their places in the farmer's wood pile. In some cases it is well to let the orchards go, in other cases where the orchards were planted to the right variety it is a shame and unfair to the merits of the industry to let these orchards die. The cul - tivation and care of an orchard means the utilization of idle capital for the production of wealth. Many of these orchards can be cared for in a manner which will furnish employment for a large number of peo - ple cause the land which they occupy to pay dividends on the money invested and furnish a salary for the man who operates them. The writer has had personal experience to face the assertions just made. Orcharding in Eastern Nebraska on a commercial scale is deserving of the State encouragement, I believe it is not only a privilege but the duty of those who make the laws governing our State, to see it, that every possible encouragement it offered to develope and promote Nebraska's undeveloped industries this society stands ready to encourage any constructive legislature which will help build the fruit industry of Eastern Nebraska, and we ask that funds may be pro - vided, which will enable our extension service in Horticulture at the University to carry on more effectively the orchard demonstration work which is now under way. Our society is equally anxious that the potato industry in Northwestern Nebraska shall be given such legis - lation as it merits and deserves. There are thousands of acres of good potato land in Northwestern Nebraska yet to be put under cultivation. We hear the constant clamor of the high cost of living and today po - tatoes are selling from $1.50 to $2.00 per bushel. Cannot something be done to increase the production and bring this luxury down to a price where it can be once more used as a necessity and grace the table of the family of average means. There is one other phase of Nebraska's Horticulture which this Society has always encouraged in the past and which should receive more attention in the future. That ig landscape Horticulture. If we </seg>

            <seg id="p026">25 expect Nebraska to be a beautiful state a desirable place to live as well as a place where we might stay while making money we must make more liberal use of hardy ornamentals. This subject Is to be discuss - ed by experts on Wednesday afternoon program of this meeting. The writer wishes to say that I sincerely hope that those who have in hand the driecting of the Societies work in the future will be ever mindful of the fact that service to the State is the greatest measure Of success. Mr. Howard: You have now heard the president's address and we will have the privilege of discussing this paper, and it is now open for discussion. Mr. Keyser, the President has touched upon many important things, that the Society is working on, and is interested in, and will be more interested in the future, and I would like to hear free discussion following the things that he has touched upon, and the things that he has suggested to you. Mr. Keyser: There is one thing that I should have said some - thing about, and I have overlooked it, and that is the request that the University is making to carry out it's demonstration work. They are asking for a small farm to be put In the hands of the University, and operated as a demonstration farm in Southeast Nebraska. I meant to make mention of that, because it has been something that I have been very much interested in, and I think the Society should be. I hope that each of us will make it our business to see our lawmakers and call special attention to that item. A number of them have ex - pressed themselves as being anxious to do something, and they say, "now you boys who are interested in fruit, you know what is needed in the State better than we do. Make your wants known, and we will try to serve you. Now that has been the attitude of every member of the legislature that I have talked to. Of course this particular item is a matter of legislation, and after the appropriation is made, we will see that Professor Howard looks after the farm down there, and grows fruit. This state is so slow with all the work that has been done. Think of it. ten years ago demonstrations were given out in Eastern Ne. braska. I had the honor of carrying the pole myself in four differ - ent orchards of Eastern Nebraska, and even some of those fellows hare forgotten how to spray and take care of their orchard. I do not tee any other way to utilize these ideal orchards which should produce fruit, and keep the price down, so that others in Nebraska who can grow fruit, can have the benefit of it. There are hundreds of orchards in Eastern and Southeastern Nebraska, that should have some lire young fellow in them to teach the owners how to grow fruit. It can be done, and we offer our fruit as an example of what can be produced. It does not take a college education, although it may take a college education or direction, for a few of those technical diseases which we do not understand. If we are going to build np an Industry, we J»i»i-u&gt;«.ioii </seg>
            <seg id="p027">26 will have to take some decisive action to bring this thing about. If it takes legislation, and if it takes compulsory spraying to make these growers take care of those orchard lands, do it, but let's try in the first place to give our educational institution a free hand, and let us see if we cannot accomplish without legislation what some of the other states have accomplished with legislation. I would like to hear this subject discussed thoroughly from everybody as the next speaker is not here, and we will have a little more time to devote to anything along this line that we can offer. Although the next speaker is not here, we have his paper which was sent to the Secretary, and the Secretary will now read the paper to the Society before we have any discussion upon the President's address. The subject of the paper is. SOMK POINTERS ON YOUNG ORCHARDS By George T. Grota, Jr. of Wathena, Kansas. (The Secretary reads as follows) The great interest in orcharding which developed during the latter part of the first decade of the century is still at its height. Men from all walks of life are turning towards orcharding as one branch of farming in which they would like to engage. Wealthy men are setting out commercial orchards on their estates, farmers in orchard sections are enlarging their fruit plantations, while the small producers are putting out a few hundred trees as a small income aside from their farm products. No wonder that the future prospectors are shaking their heads and wondering as to what the outcome will be. No won - der that the most enthusiastic advocates of orcharding are speculat - ing as to whether it may not be over done. It is a well known fact, however, that the general public is de - pendant upon magazines and newspaper articles for Information, and while such articles undoubtedly strive to give the truth about condi - tions in general, there is a possibility that part of the conditions may be misread by the reporters who frequently are not well acquainted with orcharding. If in a certain community a grower sets out fifty acres of orchard, the fact is given considerable space in local papers, papers, and is usually copied by other papers and in this way assured of wide spread publicity. If during the same time his neighbor is cut - ting out one hundred acres of orchard which has become unprofitable, the fact is hardly mentioned by the local paper and is seldom copied by the others. There is no attempt to criticise the papers for this dif - ference in bringing to the attention of the public the things which will be of the greatest interest, but in this way a false impression may be easily gained by the reader. It must be very plain to a fruit grower that this condition is especially true of the central states, for a trip through any of the Missouri or Mississippi Valley States reveals orchard after orchard being removed or in its last stage of bearing, while it is seldom that one of the commercial size is being set out. In the </seg>
            <seg id="p028">SOME POINTERS ON YOUNG ORCHARDS 27 East and the extreme West, however, the condition Is reversed, and un - doubtedly these sections will be gaining in acreage lor several years, and it is no doubt the heavy planting in these localities that are causing the growers the most concern. But while there has undoubtedly been a wonderful Interest in the fruit business in recent years, and while many who have gone into It, without sufficient thought and preparation undoubtedly will be dis - appointed, and while we may even have to admit that the price of fruit is likely to decline, it still seems to the writer that for the right man, in the right place, with the right methods, the growing of fruit offers a healthful and delightful occupation with at least a reasonable assurance of satisfactory financial returns. Let us examine the situ - ation briefly and see what ground there may be for such a belief and what conditions one must fulfil if he expects to be successful. There are several methods by which we may judge the over pro - duction danger. First the U. S. census of 1900 reported 201,794.000 apple trees of bearing age as against 151,323,000 trees in 1910, a de - crease of 50,471,000 trees or 33 per cent. Missouri the leading State in the union in bearing trees in 1910 had 14,360,000. trees this being a decrease since 1900 of 5,680,000 trees. Kansas my home state re - ported 6,930,000 trees of bearing age in 1910 against 11,848,000 trees in 1900. In 1910 there were 2,937,000 trees of bearing age in the State oi Nebraska, while in 1900 the number was 3,877,000 trees. Do not those figures seem to indicate that it will be several ears before we get back to our standard? And we must not forget that at the same time the production of apples has been declining the population has been increasing, so it will require many apples to provide as many as per capita as we had in former years. Passing now from Uncle Sam's estimate to the opinions of leas important persons, we find it a very general opinion among people who have given the matter some thought, that a great many orchards which we set out with high hopes a few years ago, are already aban - doned as hopeless. The writer himself can think of dozens. This was inevitable, considering the people who set them out, men who knew obsolutely nothing of orcharding except what they read in magazines and daily papers. Another thing which will help to delay this dreaded time of over production, is the constantly increasing list of orchard pests, these which attack the tree itself being especially instrumental In holding the acreage of profitable bearing trees low. The Blister Canker, or 111. Apple Tree Canker, is becoming one of the most serious of all dis - eases. It is causing a loss greatly in excess of such pests as the San Jose scale, for which strict quarantines have been established by law. Attacking the tree usually about the time it is reaching its most profit - able bearing period. It causes the rapid death of many varieties which are especially susceptible. The Black Rot Canker is becoming a serious </seg>
            <seg id="p029">28 wood disease in the East, and the Praciflc Coast Canker, is becoming destructive in the West. Aside from these tree diseases and the many insects which feed upon the woody part of the tree, there are a hoard of Insects and dis - ases which attack the fruit itself, and are responsible for the loss of n-iliions of bushels annually, it is little wonder that many Inexperienced growers become discouraged after a few years of ineffectual attemtps to produce good fruit under these conditions and allow the orchard to stand unprotected, or cut down the trees and plant crops which are better understood. Apples will grow on a great variety of soils, but most kinds do best on deep, rich clay or loams. Soil very rich in nitrogen should be avoided as they will product too much wood growth at the expense Of fruit. Very few soils are too rich for apples, however, many farm - ers plant their trees on the poorest and roughest piece of land on the farm because such soil will not produce any other profitable crop. If the trees do not produce good fruit in a few years without any atten - tion, the orchard is abandoned, and the farmer says fruit growing is a failure. Does he expect this of other crops and has he a right to ex - pect it of apples? Give the apple trees the care and attention that other crops get and they will respond by producing profitable crops of fruit. It is a mistake to expect trees to grow well on poor soil, for food is just as essential to tree growth as to the growth of corn or wheat. It requires a large quantity of food to produce a crop of trees and even a greater quantity to produce the fruit. It is believed that different varieties have adaptations to dif - ferent soils, which adaptations, if known, would guide the orchardist in the selection of a site for an orchard, or the selections of varieties suited to any particular soil as he may possess. Therefore I will only slightly touch the subject of varieties which do best in your territory. In the first place, much depends on whether the planter wants a family or commercial orchard. If he is planting a family orchard, it is best to plant only those which do best in his district and choose one or more trees of the very earliest varieties and other varieties that will mature later so that the fruit will be fit for use each month until late in autumn, when he will pick and store his winter fruit. In plant - ing a commercial orchard he may largely disregard his own taste and that of his family and select only those varieties that are heavy and regular bearers, good keepers, good shippers and these that bring high prices on the market. In doing this he is referring to the de - mands of the market and is planting those varieties for which the public will pay the highest prices. Such varieties as the Jonathan, Grimes Golden Wine saps, Delicious, Gano and Ben Davis do well in this orchard district and have proven to us that they have been money makers in the past and still have a good future. About the safest way for the planter is to take the advise of the Professor of Horticulture In the nearest experiment station, and of his neighbors, in order to know </seg>

            <seg id="p031">SOME POINTERS ON YOUNG ORCHARDS 29 what results have been obtained by those who have tested the varieties, say three or four varieties, and plant them alternately In that way the cross pollination will improve the quality and quantity of fruit. Considering the value of an orchard of good commercial fruit and con - sidering the time it takes to bring it into bearing, the importance of wise selections is evident but how to advise involves to many local questions that it is a difficult undertaking. Having settled on the question of varieties, the next thing Is buy - ing the stock. Here are some of the points to be considered under this head. (1) Where grown, (2) Age of trees, etc. There are several asons why it is usually advisable to patronize local nurseries. They generally handle the varieties that are beat adapted to local conditions, but if the local dealers have not the required varieties in stock, or If ir trees are not of the desired shape, it would be better to order i a distant nursery rather than to accept undesirable stock. By ■alinp with the local nursery men the buyer can visit the nursery and -rsonully select his stock, and at the same time reduce the risk of in - Jucing injurious insects and diseases that are not common to the borhood. Again, home nursery men are more likely to supply tin kind of stock ordered and correctly label their goods for if they of - ten misrepresent them they cannot long continue in business.. . The agent for a distant firm, on the other hand can constantly change his &amp; of operation. Still further by securing trees at the near-by nursery all danger from damage by long transit and injurious effects of sunshine and frosts are avoided; besides, if the farmer makes his purchase direct fi ■»in the nursery men, he will save the expense of the middleman or agent, and is less liable to the mistakes and injury that may occur rough repeated handling. On tiie second point, age of trees that it best, there seems to be uite a difference of opinion, the idea of different men ranging from &gt;ne to three or even more years. Personally the writer is rather sttongly in favor of the one year tree for the following reasons: it costs less, the freight is less. This is not an important matter but it is worth considering, especially if the stock comes a long distance. Only thrifty trees are salable at one year; that is a tree must be a good growthy plant to reach a salable size in one year. This is certainly important. It is doubtful if a stunted tree ever becomes vigorous and thrifty as one which never had a set back. The tree can be headed at any desired heighth while the two year tree has had Its head formed by the nurseryman and it is difficult to change this type, and also the younger tree will stand transplanting better than the older one. The thorough preparation of the land should be regarded as a very important element in planting an orchard. An apple orchard Is very different in its requirements from any annual crop; yet how fre - quently does it occur that the land for it received even less attention than does the land for corn or wheat. Deep plowing of the land a </seg>
            <seg id="p032">30 year or two previous to setting trees Is highly desirable. Wet places should be drained. Poorer soils should also he well fertilized and have the manure worked deeply into the soil. It is never advisable to plant trees in fresh sod. In preparing sod land, it is best to plow in midsummer and cross it again in the fall, leaving it rought through the winter. Fall plowing is advantageous in any case, as it helps to destroy many insects such as cut worms and also insure a thorough pulverizing of the soil. Early in the spring the ground should be disced and harrowed until it is mellow. It is also advisable to go over it again with a harrow just before planting to destroy any weeds that have started. The treatment of the trees at planting time has a very great in - fluence upon their future welfare. Many planters set trees in their permanent position without applying the least amount of rational treatment to them. For example, trees are planted in the orchard in the same condition as they are received from the nursery. At the close to the first season, the owner is much troubled to learn the reason for the poor growth, and in many instances the utter failure of his trees. Holes for the trees must be large enough to accomodate all the roots and deep enough to allow the tree to set not less than two inches deeper than it stood in the nursery. After the tree has been placed in its exact position, by means of a tree locator or by sightnig. the roots are spread out evenly in all directions and then the hole is filled? The first dirt put into the hole should be the rich soil from the surface. This should be worked tightly under and between the roots by using the fingers. Slightly moving the tree up and down will aid in getting the soil under the roots. The holde is then half filled with surface soil under the roots. The hole is then half filled with surface soil and tramped down firmly; after this the hole is filled to the top with the other soil and tramped again. A few shovels full of loose dirt on this completes the operation. In digging the trees at the nursery all of the roots are cut of con - siderably. Many of those that remain are more or less bruised and at the time of transplanting all of these bruised roots should be cut off. After the tree is set it must be pruned. If it is a one year whip this pruning consists merely in cutting it off or heading it at the de - sired heighth. However the tree should be gone over every year and encourage to grow the desired way. Several yearly trimmings will re - quire no more time than a single pruning after a lapse of three or four years. Irregular pruning tends to throw the young tree out of balance, for the removable of so much wood in one year is always followed by a rank growth the following season. The regular annual treatment may be done any time during the dormant season, and the operation consists in removing the unnecessary growth and moderately heading in the strong growing branches. Much may be done in the way of directing the growth of the branches by cutting back to the bud that points to </seg>
            <seg id="p033">SOME POINTERS ON YOUNG ORCHARDS 31 the right direction. If a spreading habit is desired the cut should be made just above one of the lower or outer buds. With trees that are naturally spreading in habit, on the other hand, a more upright growth may be induced by cutting back to a bud on the upper or inner side of the branch. The important point in the whole matter Is the develop - ment of a strong well balanced structure with a large bearing surface, in pruning and shaping the young tree the grower should keep In mind the matter of convenience. He should endeavor to keep the tree as low as possible to aid in the operation of spraying and harvesting. The orchardist should be sure to keep his trees growing vigorous - ly during the first summer, as this is the most vital period in the his - tory of an orchard. It is highly essential that the trees be planted early and have a good start before mid summer. In sections where irrigation is not practiced, for summer drought is likely to prove fatal to trees of low vigor and slow growth. Any crop grown in the orchard the first years should be one that required frequent cultivation such crops as small fruit, potatoes tomatoes, melons, etc., are therefore well adapted to young trees, while the grain and pasture or meadow crops should be avoided. Tillage should be continued until about the first of August in a normal year. Disease and insects are likely to make their visitation upon the young orchard during the first year. The grower must be very watch - ful for their appearance and be ready to shorten their stay to the minimum. Such insects as the leaf skeletonizer, green aphis, apple borer. San Jose Scale are the most prominent insects. Timely appli - cations of the best preventitives and remidies for these pests is the only safe guard. Careful and frequent observation is the rule for suc - cess in dealing with opponents. Trees should be also protected from rabbits, mice and gophers. One of the beat methods the writer has used in protecting the trees from rabbits was by the use of window screen. They should be about two feet high or as high as the trunk of the tree will permit and should stand out from the tree a short dis - tance, also extend in the ground at least one inch. By packing some cheap cotton around the top between the wire and tree will aid in keeping the borers from entering the tree, also prevent any injury to the tender bark during windy weather. In the beginning of this paper the writer said that for the right people caring for an orchard by right methods and In the right place the future is anything but dark. Who are the right people? Any - body with the love for the business and who has the knowledge, or who can hire some one with knowledge to do the work. Now while they are, of course many exceptions, it would seem that two classes of orchard ventures are especially likely to be successful. One of these is that of a farmer in an orchard section who already has his living assured and who decides to add to his orchard planting. And the other is that of the man who has money enough to go into orchard - ing on a reasonably large scale so that he can devote his time to it If </seg>
            <seg id="p034">32 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY he hag the knowledge himself or if not can hire an expert foreman. As a rule the thing for the inexperienced man to do, if he Is sure that he wants an orchard Is to work with some practical orchard man until he requires a reasonable knowledge of the business. Right methods are only less important than right men. The writer has tried to sug - gest some of the things which he thinks are of importance. And even the best men with the best methods cannot succeed if they ignore too much the question of the right place, an unadapted soil, a frosty lo - cation, and undue exposure to fierce winds add much to the failure of the man who grows fruit. ]&gt;i«i'U*«i"ii Mr. Harrison: Now returning to the subject mentioned in the President's address regarding the demonstration farm, it is the idea of this little farm, to see how cheap you could get an orchard into bearing by investigating in this way, instead of seeing how much money you might spend upon it. The President : Let us hear from Professor Howard on that. Professor Howard: In answer to Mr. Harrison's question, I would like to mention some things that are my own personal opinions re - garding such an orchard. Now in talking this matter over with various members of the State Society, and in talking it over with the Dean of College, and with the Chancellor of the University, and one or two members of the Board of Regents, I have advanced this idea all along. If the legislature sees fit to allow enough funds to start what might be termed a demonstration orchard, that one of the chief things we will have to keep in mind always, about such a farm is that it should be run just as economically as possible. That is, plant those things that you know are standard things to plant upon the orchard soil of our State. The orchard should be located somewhere in Eastern Nebraska. Then keep strict account of everything that is spent, and everything that is taken in. It should be purely a business proposition, because the public will be donating for it, and they have a right to know what is being done with the money. Make it pay as fast and as soon as pos - sible, from the day it is equipped and started. To do that my opinion would be this. Utilize certain vegetables and certain small fruits, such as strawberries and grapes. If it is good land, already built up, you can take something off of the land, while the trees are coming into bear - ing, to make it a paying proposition. It should not be called an exper - imental orchard, but it should be called a demonstration farm. We have inquiries from outside the State such as "We have heard of the possibilities of Eastern Nebraska for Orchards, What are they?" If we had such an orchard from year to year we could get out circulars and spread them broad cast. And when anyone stops in, it will always be explained to them, and it will advertise Nebraska's possibilities as a fruit growing State. And furthermore speaking regarding that matter that Mr. Keyser touched upon of using your influence or good will to </seg>
            <seg id="p035">Pruning Apples</seg>
            <seg id="p036">33 men who may ask you what would be done with such a farm. I might say that unlike some other propositions it would not be a white elephant upon the State's hands. It should not be. If I were a legislator I would scrutinize this item carefully. The legislator would and probably should say, "Why are you asking for something additional? Does that mean that you are going to ask that for the next fifty years? Unless the thing is self supporting from the time it is started almost it would be defeat - ing its very object. That, it seems to me is about all I have to say. Mr. Marshall: If we could not pay a dividend on that farm, we could not encourage the very idea of planting orchards. We have to make it go, or it is a failure, and that is all there is to it. It has to be Just that much different from the other institutions of the State. It has to pay back into the State Treasury or it is defeating the very object for which it is created. But I am satisfied, that if it was carried on right, it will after the first four or five years pay into the Treasury of the State dividends upon the money originally invested. It must do that, and if it does not do it, it is a failure, and that is all there is to it. Why I know people who are on just such farms as that, who are mak - ing a living out of it, for a good sized family, and giving their chil - dren a college education. It looks to me as if it would be an advertise - ment of the right kind, also that it should pay. and I am certainly in favor of it The President: I do not know exactly what the Society should do about that. Perhaps we should pass a resolution or vote on it, cr give it to some member of the Legislature or to the Regents or who - ever the proper party is, but whoever we give it to or whatever we do. we should let the legislature know that the fruit men favor that kind of an appropriation, and we want It, and the chair would enter - tain a motion of that sort so that it could be gotten down into tangible form. Mr. Youngers: In a case of that kind, if the resolution is adopted, I would make it to the Regents, as they will have charge of it, and as 1 understand they are willing to father this bill or father the appro - priation, and willing to stand behind it. Now our endorsements should be to them stating that we are back of that, and stating that we are back of it in order to help them secure that farm. That would be my judgment instead of having any member of the legislature appealed to. Let it go right in with the University Bill, and they will take care of us, which they expressed their desire to do. And I certainly think that is the nicest way to do it. The President: Since it is the duty of the Chair to appoint a Resolution Committee. I believe if there are no objections I will do that, and I will ask the Committee to draw a resolution embodying these things that have been expressed here in regard to this farm. I would appoint on that Committee Mr. Peter Younger, Mr. G. A. Mar - shall, Professor Howard, the Vice-President of our Society. I really would like to see a little more discussion of that end of the commercial </seg>
            <seg id="p037">34 orchard. What are we going to do with these old orchards, and to encourage better grading and increase our production, and take care of those fragments of orchards until the young ones come into bear - ing. I think if you will travel up and down the State as some of us have done you will be impressed with the need of action along that line. Mr. Brown: I would move that this matter of recommendation should be referred to the Committee on Resolutions, and then they can consider it, and bring in a suggestion for a proposed resolution, and then when that is done, it would be discussed by the full house. Mr. George Marshall: Your idea was that this Committee would report later at one of the regular sessions? The President: Oh, yes, the Resolution Committee. I simply asked if there was any further discussion on that question that was mentioned in my paper. I undertook to draw out two of those im - portant things. There are so many things in Horticulture to touch upon. I called attention to the Commercial Potato industry in one sec - tion, which is a big thing, measured in dollars and cents, and the fruit industry in the southeastern part of Nebraska is another. The two most important Horticultural industries in the State. I am more familiar with the fruit end of it, than I am with the other. I know it is a problem in other States, and that other States are going so far as to even legislate and make these different fellows take care of their orchards. Should we do that, or should we give our extension service an opportunity so they can help. Are you ready yet for any drastii legislation, or do we want to continue and widen out our educational campaign and see if we can get some more of these orchards taken care of properly. You men who know what can be produced in Eastern Nebraska, and know the quality fruit and see the opportunity for de - velopment of an undeveloped industry, and then drhe through there and see men who are falling down, whole communities of them who are not producing fruit which is a credit to the State. What would you do about that. Gentlemen, we cannot develope a fruit industry unless we ad - vertise our goods, and to do that we must grow a kind of fruit which will advertise the fruit. Do we want to legislate and if we do, what can the Society do to encourage the right kind of legislation, and if there are any here that want any help, how can the Society help them? Mr. Christy: I think along this line it is going to be necessary to legislate and educate both? Legislation, just simply undertaken to force people to do anything when they don't know what they are do - ing it for, I do not think would do any good, and it would not amount to very much, and even if the people in the State would know what was the right thing to do, it would not amount to much, unless the legis - lature encourages them or gives them some encouragement to do things. They are liable to fall down on what they attempt if they do not re- </seg>
            <seg id="p038">35 ceive some assistance, and so I think that the two should go together, but we must be very particular about the way we approach the sub - ject of getting legislation. Now if we as a Society just undertake to by resolution, or by any other way, make the legislature appropriate the money, to buy up farms, the first thing we know people are going to be suspicioning our Society of just being a lot of lobbiests trying to get a lot of money appropriated for our own benefits, and not see - ing that it was going to be of good to the whole State. The men who have done the most for this work in this State are Furnas, Masters. Morton, and the Pollards, and they have experimented and grown lot of varieties, and discovered a good many things, and a good many varieties of apples that can be grown in this State. There are a lot of these old orchards in the Southeast part of the State that are not worth saving. Quite a number of them that have a lot of varieties that never did any good in Nebraska, and possibly never will even under the very best conditions that it is possible to bring about. Now I do not know of any Baldwins in Nebraska where they have paid for the ground they stand on. There are a few big crops. The Northern Spy. is another good apple in the East, but it does not pay here. Now I think our experimental station if we should start something of the kind, should work more on the varieties we know are good for this part of the State, and in this State. So there are a lot of things to take into consideration. And about getting the money, it is neces - sary that you must be very careful about this resolution, and how we go about to get it. I know of one man now who is gonig to use dyna - mite on some of his trees in his orchards, and I think that It the best thing he can do. because his varieties are not adapted to Nebraska. Mr. Williams: Theoretically, to my mind it would seem to me that all that is necessary is to educate our people along the lines that have been advanced in the last two years. A number of our Horticul - turists have made demonstrations, that it seems to me should be the most effective means of bringing others to see the importance of spray - ing, and if they would follow that example, those of you who have been renovating these old orchards, that demonstration should be sufficient ii seems to me to induce people all through the orchard districts to do likewise. It has been demonstrated time and again at the State Fair, and I say I think that should be sufficient, but if it is not, it is my opinion that for the protection of those who do spray, that we should have legislation requiring others to spray so as to prevent our getting the results of their neglect of spraying orchards. It might be well for us to consider that, and that was a method invoked in the Northwest, but there is no more effective way of bringing it to the minds of those who have neglected it in the past, than by legislation. Mr. Youngers: If we undertook to pass a resolution or a law that would make it compulsory to spray, I believe we would stir up a hor - net's nest, but I believe if we would take and educate a man with a small orchard, to spray with a small spray, if he would do that, we </seg>
            <seg id="p039">36 would be successful. Teach him to work with the barrel spray, instead of getting a machine that would cost him two or three hundred dollars, and let him know that he would be successful with the smaller spray. If we could prove that to him, I think we could accomplish more than any other way, but when you talk to a man who has only fifty or a hun - dred or twenty-five trees, or tell him that he must equip himself with a machine that will cost him two or three hundred dollars, you are scaring him out right away. Mr. Williams: Why not have a co-operative spray Mr. Youngers: Well in that way you depend altogether too much on the other fellow, and he depends on you, and in the long run you don't do anything; but if you have your own little individual spray, and get your crop of apples off from there each year, and in good con - dition, I think this little spray will help to solve the question. Mr. Marshall: Uf course if it is not out of order I will second Mr. Brown's motion, that the President's address which covers all of these things be referred to the Resolution Committee, that they bring out the points that should be discussed, and we might try to discuss it at a later session this afternoon or tomorrow. The President: I think that would be in order, and I will put that motion to refer the President's address to the Resolution Committee Carried. George Marshall: We have quite an audience here now, and I notice that most of them, are people who are Interested. Now this compulsory spraying, while we would expect to put that in our resolu - tion if we have the time, it seems to me, that we might spend a few minutes along that line right now, discussing it. I notice they are considering that in Iowa and Kansas and Missouri and Illinois, and I notice in their meetings they are, but as I think about it, I do not see why we should impose compulsory spraying just now. I do not be - lieve we are ready for it. We are ready for that, when some danger - ous thing comes along, and is going to endanger the young orchard, because of the pest being in another one. The San Jose scale is pro - vided for by law right now, and as you know the other pests that we have, — you know that we can sit right down in the neighborhood and grow apples with that pest right next to you. And therefore it looks to me like this law, while it would be nice, it might make trouble, and we are not ready for it. I think that inside of the next ten years some way will be asked for to take care of cedar rust. In some of the South - eastern Counties, they have not been very careful about planting cedars. I would consider a little legislation along the line of grading our bulk apples, so that we know what is in the car, which would be a good thing. That was all I wanted to mention, and it looks to me like we are not ready for the compulsory spraying, but we might possibly con - alder a little legislation along the grading of bulk apples. When we </seg>

Mr. Brown: I think along that line, that if you do any thing of that kind, you are opening up an awfully broad subject and you would have a right to grade corn and wheat and oats and everything else that you ship. The President: Ex-Governor Pointer traveled over the State for years carrying on an educational campaign to clean up the Cream in the Creameries, and they did not clean up. Dirty cream was shipped, and the result was that the price of our butter was discriminated against on the New York market about four cents a pound, but the instant the legislature passed the Pure Food Law, the Commissioners went out and made them clean up, our butter went right up along with Minnesota, and the New York market. That is what something of this kind does. It is only a question of whether or not it is important enough to make them clean up their orchards. Mr. Brown: You can legislate in regard to your manufactured products, but 1 don't believe you can legislate in regard to the raw products of the soil. I don't believe that the State of Nebraska has one bit of authority to pass laws in regard to the grading of corn or v heat or anything of that kind, and if they haven't, they surely would not have for the grading of apples. Mr. Williams: In regard to the point that Mr. Marshal touched upon, as against the San Jose scale. I question very seriously whether our laws do give us the amount of protection we should have against that dangerous insect. Of course our nurseries are subject to in- spection by our State Entomologist, and we are compelled to pay a fee to secure a certificate showing we are free from that as well as other injurious insects. To my knowledge though that insect is getting a hold of the orchards of the State, and if our present law is not strong enough to clean up this, as it gets into the orchard, we need to remodel it. The facts of the case are that this scale has been found within the past two years within a mile of my place. And one instance was brought to my notice last summer in a local home or - chard of perhaps a half a dozen trees. A man brought me down a specimen of the twig, and my suspicions were aroused, and I took them to the State Entymologist, and he pronounced it the San Jose Scale, and I do not think there is any authority on his part to go to that orchard and demand the destruction of that tree. Professor Bruner, who had the matter in charge at the time, told me that this man could go out and determine where that scale </seg>
            <seg id="p042">38 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY existed, but he had not authority to provide for the destruction of the tree. Professor Howard: I will say that the State Entomologist is vested with the power of doing about anything he wants to do with the orchard. He first must instruct that man, or require him to spray the orchard with the proper material at the proper time for controlling San Jose Scale. Just before the growth starts is when they spray for the San Jose Scale. In my opinion anybody report - ing San Jose Scale to Professor Bruner, will find that he will take action by going himself or send one of his deputies to this orchard to see to what extent they have it, and will require that man, to spray, or will spray it himself, and charge the expense to the owner. He is vested with the power of doing that. The spray is 1.03, lime sulphur spray. 1 think if this is not enforced, it could be easily en - forced, but I do not think that the San Jose Scale has been found in more than two or three or four orchards in the State. Mr. Williams: The point which I raised particularly, and which the Professor admits is true, is that we do not have sufficient force at the hands of our State Entomologist to go in the State and examine orchards, and watch for this spread there. There is perhaps as great Inability for the spread of this disease, as there is in the nurseries, think this Society should take at least some action, in demanding a more vigorous watch for this insect, on the part of our authorities bo that the investigations may be carried to the orchards as well a the nurseries. The President: The discussion of this subject is never ending, if we want to make it so. Perhaps we should continue it. Hut Mr. loungers must be at another meeting this afternoon, and he wanted to give the report of the Treasurer. I am going to ask Mr. Youiigers the Treasurer to give his report at this time, as it will be more con - venient for him. The report of the Treasurer read by Peter Youngers, the Treas - urer of the Society.

The Society met pursuant to adjournment, and the following pro - ceedings were had and done: The President: The first subject on the program this afternoon is, "Extension work in Horticulture" by Professor E. H. Hoppert, the Extension Horticulturist and Professor R. F. Howard, head of the De - partment of Horticulture at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln. We will listen to the talk by Professor Howard first. r VIKNSIOX WORK IX HOKT1CI LTl KE By IVofessor K. H. Hoppert, the Extension Horticulturist and Professor K. F. Howard, Head of the Department of Horticulture at the Inlversity of Ni-lu-.i-ka. Lincoln. Professor Howard: The main thing to do is to start a campaign fur better orchard management. Start a campaign to help the orchard grower, and inspire him if it takes that, or help him if it takes that, or induce him by various means if it takes that, to give his orchard better care. This might be done by showing the possibilities in fruit growing, and show what it is possible to do by citing things that are actually being done. Now I am one man that believes is being shown. Talk is cheap. When you are talking with men who have their hard earned cash invested in something more than talk is neces - sary. It seems that some of the growers of our State lack confidence. They have an orchard, and lack confidence in that orchard. If we can instill some of the growers with the type of confidence that the late Mr. Pollard had in our possibilities for fruit growing, it would certainly be a great thing. We have as a part of the University, the Agricultural College. Now as a part of the Agricultural College, we have the Experiment Station and the Extension Service. Now you might define briefly the function of the different parts of the Agricultural College. The experimental station, and the extension service are two different parts, but co - ordinate in the College. The instruction work is one phase of the work that is quite important. We have students in the College, that is the four year University course in which a degree is given. If you take four years work, a certain amount of work is prescribed, and a certain amount elective. We have students taking that course, and then we have the School course in Agriculture, which is _a secondary school, taking the boys in from the eighth grade. That phase of the agriculture work is quite important. We have something like five hundred students in the School of Agriculture. Then we have a short course where the men come in mid-winter and spend six weeks with us. Then there is the Experiment Station which is separate from the instruction work, and a great number of experi - ments are being carried on by means of Federal Funds and State </seg>
            <seg id="p044">40 funds. We are attempting to work out the principles involved in the practice of Agriculture. I might say that a number of the facts that are worked out by the Experiment Station and by the U. S. Depart - ment of Agriculture, are not worked out in a year. Some of us might be prone to think they are comparatively few, but nevertheless those things which we know are good practice, and that are worth while in extending, or really worked out in that department of the Agricultural College known as the Experimental Station. It requires years some - times to get enough definite information to enable us to go out and say. "You should do this or that thing." As far as the Department of Horticulture is concerned we have been conducting experiments, such as variety tests, pruning ex - periment, fruit bud formation, the effect of blasting holes for setting trees, canker investigation, treatment of canker, spraying experiments, and planting experiments. Then the extension department attempts to explain to the public the things that have been worked out by the Experiment Station. That is the phase that Mr. Hoppert, and myself want to take up and explain to you. Up until two years ago the force that was working in the Depart - ment of Horticulture was handicapped for lack of facilities for ex - plaining things. It did not have any men available to do that thing. All of them were tied up more or less with instructional work, and ex - perimental work and they were not able to get out into the State. A little over two years ago, Congress passed an act known as. "The Smith-Lever Law," enabling the different states to take up the exten- sion work more fully than they had been able to do previous to that time. This law provides a certain amount of money, and that money will be put with State's funds to carry on extension work. It must be something of an extension nature, they won't allow us to spend the money to go into the State and carry on experiments. When using Smith- Lever Funds they limit us to things that have been worked out. and are good practice, and to explain that knowledge in various ways by demon - strations. Nebraska is one of the States which has taken advantage of this "Smith-Lever act." We are getting now about $3ii.oipii. That is not all for Horticultural extension though, it is for all phases of agriculture. We have the specialist paid entirely by this government fund. He can devote all of his time to this one thing, that is, he does not have to stay in and do instructional work, but he gets out into the field. We get letters every day in the year on some phase of Horti - culture. It is unsatisfactory to tell a man how to spray or how to prune an orchard by correspondence or bulletins. We rec - ognize the fact that it was not possible to send our specialists to call up - on each man who would send in a letter, so we try to do it in anoher way. When 1 get requests I write back, and tell that man that the institution maintains a Horticulture specialist, and if there is sufficient interest in his community to justify a pruning demonstration, or a spraying demonstration, or any other kind of a demonstration, where </seg>

            <seg id="p046">EXTENSION WORK IN HORTKTLTl'RE 41 we can help, the State will pay this man's expense to that community, where he can give that demonstration. The number of orchards that a man can handle during the spraying season are com - partively few, and so it resolves itself into a question of whether this man's time should be devoted during the growing season to compara - tively few orchards, or to attempt to have him visit a great number of orchards, and have him just touch the high places. We thought it would be better to have him devote most of his time for the first year to a few orchards, and give them attention throughout the growing season, but have them well distributed through the representa - tive fruit section. We are making this proposition to requests that come in for help from the home orchards. We tell them that the specialist's time is taken quite largely during the regular spraying schedule, but any time during the winter that they will write in, men with home orchards, arrangements will be made during the winter mouths for the man to come and give a spraying demonstration or pruning demonstration. They are taking advantage of that, and Mr. Hoppert is one of the busiest men in the College. Now in addition to that, I might say those orchards that he is devoting quite a portion of his time to, and that he has had charge of this past growing Ma - son, among them are three representative commercial orchards in Eastern Nebraska, that have been given some care, but not what we would term excellent care. He has personally supervised the prun - ing and cultivation and the spraying and more or less of the harvesting. He will give you a detailed report this afternoon on the results that he secured from those orchards. Now in addition to this orchard work there is a demand for other types of Horticulture extension work that we hope to develope shortly. The landscape work is a part of the Horticultural work, and it is one of the things that is going to be of great importance within the near future. The institution has been able only recently to secure the ser - vices of Professor Nicolet, a man who has had a lot of training in Landscape gardening. He is on the College Staff, but not on the ex - tension staff. Most of his time will have to be devoted to the instruc - tional work on this subject, and forestry. We have promise from the Dean of the Agricultural College, that he will be allowed to work in the extension work in landscape soon. That is by having a man devote his full time to the landscape work, just as Mr. Hoppert is de - voting his full time to the Horticultural business. He will have to restrict his work to demonstrations in order to fall under the Smith- Lever Act. This man could go into the various towns, parks and pri - vate estates, and use them for demonstration purposes. He could plant them with the proper things suitable for that particular section of Ne - braska, and have meetings at least once a year, calling attention to the effect that is being produced when one uses the proper shrubs, properly arranged around these different public places. Twenty-five towns are this year, co-operating with the extension </seg>
            <seg id="p047">42 service in arousing more interest in the home gardening. I cannot tell you off hand, how many there were registered for this school garden- Ing, they are mostly boys and girls from ten to fourteen years old. Each of these twenty-five towns, have either hired a supervisor, paid by the town, or else they have utilized their agricultural teacher in the town High School, making the circuit of the town every week, and encourag - ing the youngster how to arrange his vegetables and what to plant. And It also shows them how to arrange those vegetables, and how to market their products. Mr. Hoppert will now give you a description of the orchards he worked in the past season, and perhaps will tell you more regarding the nature of his work in these home orchards, where he has worked from time to time. Mr. E. H. Hoppert, the Extension Horti - culturist of the I'niversity of Nebraska will now talk to you along the lines I have indicated. KXTEXSION WOKK IN HOMK ORCHAIWS By Mr. E. H. Hoppert. To encourage the growing of better fruit and more, to create mo interest in the care of fruit gardens, orchards and vineyards in M braska, that is one of the big problems for the Extension Specialist Horticulture. The person, who travels across country in an auto, who is inter - ested in orchards will notice the dilapidated little family orchards, dead trees, dying trees in nearly every one and looking like they had never even threatened with the spray rod and the pruning saw. Disease, invited by neglect is taking thousands of trees each year and is gradually wiping out the old home orchards. What little fruit is born on the trees that are left, is wormy, scabby, sour, small, it will not keep until winter and must be used immediately. Too often the hogs have to be turned into the orchard to clean up the half rotted fruit. In the winter the school boys and girls have to do without their daily apples or otherwise the father has to buy them in town, when two dozen trees or even a dozen trees well cared for, pruned and sprayed would yield apples in abundance, apples that one need not be ashamed to offer to visitors, apples that will keep well till spring if put in an outdoor pit or a good cave. Most of the young trees too are following in the path of the previous generation. What's to be done? What is the remedy? How can the knowl - ;e of fruit growing, of pruning and spraying, the necessity and value such treatments be disseminated? A number of methods suggest themselves among which are Farmer's Institutes, short courses, demonstration meetings, demon- </seg>
            <seg id="p048">EXTENSION WORK IN HOME ORCHARDS 43 station orchards, personal visits to orchard owners, publications and literature on the subject. Farmer's Institutes though still quite common are going out of vogue more and more each year. Their educational value other than the social can rightfully be questioned. Short courses lasting from Monday to Friday are being substituted for the institutes wherever possible. Meetings are held as much as formerly except that a reg - ular course of instruction is given on definite subjects, which are selected by the local organization. This is a great improvement over the old system, but even this method of diseminating facts is critixed, and it does have it's disadvantages. "It is easy to talk but you will have to show us" some say. Demonstrations in pruning and spray - ing in the orchards solve the problem partially but not satisfactorily. The best way undoubtedly to make the care of the home orchard more general in this State is by the use of demonstration orchards where the orchard owner co-operates with the extension specialist* in pruning and spraying. Meetings can be held in these orchards at pruning time and at spraying time to demonstrate what is necessary to do to secure better fruit and more fruit. One or two trees can be left unsprayed and unpruned as a check on the others that are pruned and sprayed. At harvest time meetings can be held at these orchards to note the results obtained and compare them with those obtained in unsprayed, uncared for orchards. During 1916 no demonstration home orchards were selected be - cause it was thought the three commercial orchards in the Eastern part ot the State selected for that purpose would keep the extension special - ist sufflcintly busy during the spray season. However, during the year talks were given on home orchard work at four institutes with a total attendance of 200, one special fruit short course, and two regular short courses given at which 690 were present. Besides this 49 prun - ing demonstrations were given which 250 people attended and 110 orchards visited. It is hoped during the coming year to select several demonstra - tion home orchards to keep accurate records on the amount of time and money spent on the orchard and also to keep a record of the fruit produced. These records will be valuable to the stock and grain farmer, for they would show at just what time the orchard requires attention and whether he could afford to spray or whether he had bet - ter cut the orchard out entirely use the trees for stove wood, and put the ground occupied by it to corn. Most of you know that the Eastern section of this State is ad - mirably adapted for fruit growing especially the growing of apples and grapes. The climate is favorable; seldom is there a killing frost, seldom a drought serious enough to spoil the crop; the soil is ideal orchard soil, deep, rich, porous, easily worked, much more so in fact than in other fruit sections of the country; good markets nearby in the big cities and a large number of good, small markets in the western </seg>
            <seg id="p049">44 part of this state, and in the states to the North of us where fruit growing is not practiced with much success. This section known as the Loess Bluff section, contains many acres of unimproved land, unim - proved because it is too rough for farm crops. There is considerable improved land now under cultivation but too rough to permit of crop rotation. Such land might well be made more profitable by growing fruit. To increase the interest in commercial fruit growing in the l.oess Bluff region so that more orchards and vineyards will be set out is another problem for the extension specialist. To bring about such a condition of affairs, however, the orchards that are bearing now must be shown to be profitable not only in the years of high prices but profitable over a term of years. The season of 1915 spelled disaster for a number of growers. The continued wet weather made spraying difficult and was exceedingly favorable for scab develop- ent. That fall there was an over abundance of infected fruit. fruit was not fit to be packed and stored and hence had to be riispos immediately. Too large a proportion of the fruit was cider mat While most fruit growers were trying to break even on the fruit had, Mr. G. F. Beavers of South Omaha, in whose orchard th tension psecialist had been spraying in 1915, found little cor in selling fruit. There was very little good, sound fruit to b&lt; The problem was not one of marketing; no matter who tl or what the type of selling organization, fruit such as was in the majority of orchards could not be sold to good The problem was clearly one of producing a better grade of fr resolved itself largely into more systematic and more thorou ing. It was impossible of course for the extension specialis each individual. Therefore, it was decided to use several or demonstrations in orchard management. The specialist was t vise the work in the orchard and help with the pruning and spra and hold meetings there. In return the owner was to furnish the ap - paratus, material, and help to spray, prune and cultivate the orchard. Several trees were to be left unspra&gt;ed as che&lt;ks on the spray work. The men were to keep accurate account of this cost of all operatic and the amount of the fruit sold. Three orchards were selected, the Barrett orchard at Papillion, leased by Mr. J. Nice; Mr. C. F. Beck's orchard at Peru, and Mr. G. E Sander's orchard at Brownville. The Barrett orchard 2 % miles south of Papillion was leased by Mr John Nice in 1915. He bought a new sprayer and tried to spray that summer. One whole month was spent trying to cover 13 acres of trees. The sprayer refused to work. That fall when Prof. Howard his was almost entirely free from fungous or insect injury. Mi I Beavers was selling it at $4.00 and $4.50 while the general ru of apples was hard to sell at $3.00 to $3.50.

            <seg id="p050">EXTENSION WORK IN HOME ORCHARDS 45 and the writer visited the orchard, conditions in the orchard were pitiable. Under the northwest greening the ground was covered with rotting apples, the result of the ravages of blotch. Host of the other varieties too were Infected with Blotch or scab, or both. In the fall 1500 bushel of fruit were harvested and sold in South Omaha at an average of about 50 cents per bushel, the 67 northwest greenings not yielding a cent. The proceeds that year did not cover the expense. That winter the Winesaps and Missouri Pippins, which composed about a third of the orchard were severely pruned, canker and dead limbs removed and the tops thinned. In the spring a new Bean Duplex power sprayer was secured, a tower constructed and the or- chard was sprayed four times as recommended for scab and codling control. Lime sulfur being used as a fungicide and paste lead arsenate as the insecticide. One extra spray was given the N. W. greenings and Missouri pippins to insure control of the blotch which had ruined the crop the year before. Bordeaux mixture 3-4-50 was used. One tree each of N. W. Greening. Missouri Pippin, Ben Davis, and Winesap vas left unsprayed and unpruned as a check on the treatment given he remainder of the orchard. At harvest time the fruit from the check trees was picked and examined as well as the fruit from one tree of each of those varieties that was sprayed and pruned. It was found that on the check North- si greening tree there were just 6 sound apples or about 1 per where the sprayed trees yielded 87.5 per cent of sound fruit, in case of the Missouri Pippin, only 2 per cent of the unsprayed fruit was sound whereas on the sprayed trees 86.5 per cent was sound; in the same case of the Ben Davis the unsprayed trees had only 6.6 per cent of sound fruit whereas the sprayed trees had 88 per cent sound Of the fruit on the check Winesap 27.5 per cent was sound NM 'J4.H per cent of the fruit on the sprayed trees was sound. The orchard yielded a total of 3446 bushels of salable fruit, one &gt;ad of which was barreled, about 300 bushels sold in the orchard inder distributed in Omaha to grocers and consumers. ield was about 1500 bushels and the orchard did not I! in 1916 a net profit of 1 134.22 per car was xiienses. wt realized. The 67 N. W. greenings which had had a full crop of ap - ples and yielded not a penny this year produced 300 bushels of fruit which brought ISM or an average of about 85 cents per bushel. The orchard served its purpose well as a demonstration. During harvest time farmers for miles around visited it, most of them with the intention of buying fruit because their orchards bore none. In this way $350 worth of fruit was sold in the orchard. The Beck Orchard in Pern. Peru is situated in Nemaha County along the Missouri River. Fruit growing has been practiced commercially in this section for a dozen years or more. Power sprayers have been in use for four or fire </seg>
            <seg id="p051">46 years. However, the results derived by spraying were not entirely satisfactorily, and in 1915 spraying seemed to be of no avail In con - trolling scab. Many growers did as Mr. Beck did that year, namely pick the apples and ship them to the cider mill at 25 cents a hundred weight. In the winter of 1915 and 1916 arrangements were made with Mr. Beck to cooperate with him to try to produce better fruit and to use his orchard to demonstrate in. A pruning demonstration was held at the orchard in February but no thorough pruning was given the whole orchard. Here and there dead and diseased limbs were cut out and suckers removed. In the spring a new sprayer was purchased. In previous seasons only 3 to 4 loads of material could be applied in a day with the old outfit. The new outfit on the other hand averaged 7.4 loads per day and the four sprays applied in 17 days. With the old outfit the same amount of material could not have been applied in less than 31% days or 14% days longer which at a cost of $7.50 per day would have meant an additional expense of $110.63. Thoroughness is one of the prime essentials of spraying all parts of the trees must be well covered with spray material to be effective In controlling insects and fungi. No tower had been used in previous years and yet many of the trees are twenty feet high. Thoroughness was impossible trom the ground, even with a twelve foot extension rod and 250 pounds of pressure. Before spraying wag begun in the spring of 1916 a tower was constructed of 2x4 's. the platform was 10 or 11 feet above the surface of the ground. One man occupied this tower, drove the team and sprayed the upper portions of the trees on both sides and two men worked on the ground one on either side. Four sprays were applied as in the case of the Barrett Orchard. Mr. Beck thought it unnecessary to spray the Ganos thoroughly, saying the crop was so light that it wouldn't pay. The result was that of the 1760 bushel of Ganos produced 30 per cent were wormy, whereas of the Winesaps which had a full crop and were well sprayed therefore, only 2-3 per cent were wormy. This year Mr. Beck's orchard yielded 5292 bushels of apples which sold for $4392.46, and average of 8 3 cents per bushel as against 4500 bushels last year which brought $540 or an average of 12 cents per bushel. The remainder was sold in bulk by the hundred weight. In 1916 the bulk of the fruit was graded asd picked, 1015 barrels being sold, the remainder of the crop was sold in bulk by the hundred weight. The Sanders Orchard At Ilrownville The Sanders orchard is situated about 3 miles northeast of Brownville in the Loess Bluffs, previously mentioned. Fruit growing has become an important industry in this section, but here, too, the same conditions prevailed that were found at Peru.

            <seg id="p053">EXTENSION WORK IX HOME ORCHARDS 47 good fruit was harvested that year. Mr. G. E. Sander's orchard was selected in which to carry on the orchard demonstration work. A little pruning was done that winter but no systematic efforts made to put the orchard into good shape. This orchard was given the reg - ular four sprays the same as the other two orchards. However, early in June, Blotch was seen developing on the Missouri Pippins and an ex - tra lime sulphur spray was applied in an attempt to check its spread. In spraying this orchard no tower was used, there being too many steep places to make spraying from a tower safe. Moreover, the trees are not very tall and good spraying is possible from the ground with 225 pounds of pressure and a 12 foot extension rod. In 1916 the yield was 1721 bushels, which sold at $125 per hun - lred weight, trees run for a total of $1181.75 as against 1666 bushels n 1111 that brought $440.00 or an average of 55 cents per hundred eight Tin- accompanying table gives a detailed cost account of the expenses and receipts for the three orchards in 1916, using the care, and tree and the bushel as units of comparison. The acreage given was obtained by dividing the total number of trees in the orchard by the number of trees per acre at the distances set in the respective orchard. The cost of pruning and spraying was highest in the Papillion rchard because of the neglected condition of the trees, and because the orchard was plowed and disced, whereas the other two orchards were pruned only a little and cultivated not at all, merely moved. The cost of spraying per acre was highest for the Papillion or- iard because the trees are large and there are about 52 to the acre, hereas the trees in the Peru orchard though fully as large are «et rther apart there being only 46 to the acre. In the Brownville orchard the cost per acre was below the average because most of the tiees are rather small and but two men were required to apply the spray. The cost per tree was highest for the Peru orchard because the cost of labor was highest. $7.50 per day being the cost as com - pared with $5.35 for the Papillion Orchard and $5.50 for the Brown - ville Orchard. However, the cost of spraying per bushel of apples produced is highest for the Brownville orchard, the yield being but two bushels per tree as compared with 5.1 and 6.2 bushels on the other two. The rental given in the table for the Brownville and Peru orchard* represents an estimate at what they would bring, whereas $20.00 per acre is the amount actually paid as rental for the Papillion orchard. The column headed "Picking, Grading, Packing," besides the opera - tions mentioned, includes the cost of barrels, boxes, the cost of hauling to the shipping point, the cost of delivering to grocers and consumer*, and all the expenses connected with getting the fruit off the tree and to the buyer. The least expensive methods of handling the crop is that of selling tree run where the fruit is picked, hauled to the shipping </seg>
            <seg id="p054">48 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY point and sold, as was done with the Brownville orchard crop. There is but a slight difference in cost between the method used at Papillion, that of distributing to retailers and consumers and that of grading, packing and shiping as practiced at Peru. On the other hand the total cost of production and marketing was much the highest in the Papillion orchard mainly because of the time and money spent on pruning and cultivation to rejuvenate the That it pays to sell fruit to the retailers or consumer if possible, can be seen from the gross receipts column, 94.3 cents per buhsel being the average price received from crop produced in the Papillion orchard. The Peru orchard, too, yielded a high price namely 83 cents whereas the bulk method of selling as practiced at the Brownvill or - chard yielded but 66.6 cents per bushel. The column showing net receipts per bushel substantiates what was said regarding methods of selling though the difference here is not proportionally as great a in the gross receipts column. The net receipts per acre for the Brownville orchard are comparatively low because the production per tree was less than one half that of either of the others. This orchard is lorated on rougher land, the trees are smaller and less thrifty than is the case with the other two orchards. Though the results of the work in 1916 show that the demon - stration work has been a success it is hoped that next year's work will be even more so. A better system of cost accounts will be used which will give details of all the items of expense day by day. The amount of fruit that had to be graded out on account of size in the Peru orchard was considerable. Mr. Beck hopes to be able to prune his orchard thoroughly to increase the proportion of large apples. Mr. Sanders likewise hopes to prune his orchard and break up the sod so to give the tree an impetus for a bigger production. </seg>

            <seg id="p057">50 Discussion The President: I want to say just a word of explanation, if Mr. Hoppert will pardon this personal remark. Some of you older gentle - men may think that Mr. Hoppert is a mere German boy in the School of Agriculture, becomnig interested in helping Howard carry out his work. I want to say to you that he is amply able to buy any orchard in the State of Nebraska, If he chooses to do so. He does not have to do this work for the mere mercenery end of it. He furnished his own Ford Car to run around, and help the Professor carry out this demonstration work, which he became interested in while Mr. Howard was in Wis - consin, and he came down here to Nebraska because he saw a future in it, and he has invested some money in Richardson County, which he expects to grow into a good business, and make him good money out of it. When he comes to your place, he knows how to do the work. He said at Brownville at an institute, "Gentlemen don't lay this failure, or any failure of your crop onto the wet season. Why up in Wisconsin and Michigan they have foggy wet days all the time, worse than you ever have here. And I hate to see a man lay it onto the weather.' That is certainly all right, although it was more difficult to grow fruit in 1915 than in 1916. and 1914, but it can be done, and Pro - fessor Hoppert is the boy who is willing to show you how it can be done, and I think we all should shake hands with him, and tell him to stay with us. In looking over the fruit sections of the Country he has chosen Eastern Nebraska because he thinks it is the place to be, and he likes the class of people that we have down in this section of the country. A Member: I would like to ask Professor Hoppert, what 1 would consider the average expense In growing and packing and pa ing for the barrel on a barrel of apples, and putting them up in first class manner. I Mr. Hoppert: I do not know just exactly what that would be. depends considerably on the price of help which you have, and what you have to pay them, and what you have to pay for your barrels, but I have heard it said that many of the growers can produce a barrel of apples for less than 75 cents a barrel. Member: I notice your figures running along 25 cents a barrel, I think that they are possibly about an average. Mr. Hoppert: No, That is not an average, not all of that fruit was barreled you understand. But that is the extent distributed over the whole crop. Mr. Beck sold 60,000 pounds of apples besides the stuff that he barreled, so that the expense of barreling there, if you multiply that by three that would not give it to you accurately, be - cause he paid more than that per barrel for the expense of barreling. Seventy five cents a barrel would include the barrel, but I do not </seg>
            <seg id="p058">DISTRIBUTION OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 51 think you could do it under the conditions as they are today tor much less than that. A Member: I think that you can if you have a big volume of business Mr. Hoppert: Well where you have it organized, like in New York State, where you run out 175 to 200 barrels a day. But the way most of the men are organized in this State, I do not think they ran do it. But my work has not been that as much as getting the men to spray and produce better stuff. In 1915 we had a poor market, sure we did, but it was not due largely to the fact that the market would not take the stuff. We had so much of it that year, — my work is largely done in the production of better stuff, and after we get that then we can bother our heads about labor and other things. I do not think that we should concern ourselves with cutting down the ex - pense of operation. I know one man near Brownville said that he had none over 90 acres in six days with a spraying outfit. A person who knows anything about spraying at all, knows he has to walk his team pretty fast to do that. The President: If there is nothing further in regard to this sub - ject you will notice by the program that it is "Apple Day." We have tried to touch today on the Commercial features of the Apple Business. Tomorrow is the Home Planter's Day, which takes in the decoration, and Thursday will be the vegetable and potato day. We have a sub - ject which I think has never been discussed. We have kept away from the Commercial side of Horticulture, largely because a great many of the Horticulturists were used to that that the mission of this Society was to help the little fellows over the State. Now we have with us a man who has been buyer for one of the largest wholesale fruit House in the United States, and one of the most successful houses. They have bought apples I presume from all of us commercial growers. And I want to say that they are very satisfactory people to do business with, because they always have the cash to pay for the article, and you cannot get the fruit too good to suit them. The President: The next subject on the Program is, THK DISTRIBUTION OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES THROUGH A WHOLESALE HOUSE It)- Mr. Geo. F. Bart, Manager Fruit Department, L. Grainger A Co., Lincoln, Nebraska. I shall take for my text, "He Profits Most Who Serves Best." You as producers an we as wholesale jobbers and distributors have a dis - tinct service to perform and the more efficiently we perform it the greater will be our rewards. George Washington ate with his knife. John Quincy Adams, the </seg>
            <seg id="p059">52 first President to use a fork apoligized and said times were changing. Now the man who uses his knife as a shovel is a back number. Some people do not advertise, claiming that their fathers and grandfathers got along without it. forgetful of the fact that newcomers are getting along in a hurry with it. This present period stands out far and above all other periods as an age of progression. Business is conducted along entirely differ - ent lines than it was twenty or even ten years ago. If you as producers and we as wholeasle distributors are to keep our place in the present organization we must not stand still, but only by constantly improved methods of doing our business shall we attain to the greatest success. The few ideas I shall present to you have been gained from an experience of eighteen years in the wholesale fruit and produce busi - ness; during which time the business has entirely changed in its meth - od and manner of doing business, anil the changes have been beneficial. 1 believe the same changes have taken place or will take place in your business as a producer. This is 1917 period "Grandad" got along without using very fruit and produce, due largely, no doubt, to limited production at ited distribution. But his son and grandson deems them a necessi to better production, advertising and distribution. Fruit is in universal demand. Almost everybody fru yet I believe the present consumption can and must be increa this we are all very much interested. If people ate more fruit pills they would be healthier. "An apple a day keeps the doctci has helped very materially to increase the consumption of app We are all growing and selling something that every body lik It should then follow that we should have easy selling, but such not the case. The fruit growing and selling business is beset by t same pitfalls and perhaps more than any other line of business. You as fruit growers need organization. Never before in the his - tory of the world has the necessity of organization been greater, or Its virtues more clearly understood than now. The literal meaning of "Organization" is, — to arrange or dis - tribute into parts with the proper officials so as to work or carry out a scheme efficiently; to construct so that one part may co-operate with another; to so arrange as to be ready for service. And right here is where the fruit jobber comes in. I believe we are a part of your organization. For some years there has been, and even now there is more or less talk about doing away with the middle man and making direct sales to the consumer ostensibly for the pur - pose of reducing the high living of which we hear so much complaint on all sides. I don't know how that would work out in some other lines, but so far as the Commercial Fruit and Produce Business is </seg>
            <seg id="p060">DISTRIBUTION OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 53 concerned It would be simply impossible to carry it on successfully without the wholesale dealer. Even selling to the retail dealer direct is not practicable for the commercial fruit grower and so the middle men in the fruit and produce trade, no matter what may be said for or against them, will continue as a benign necessity or a necessary evil in the commercial fruit and produce growing Industry. Proper distribution is one of the most essential features of your business and that cannot be achieved by the producers but must be accomplished through the deal - ers or middle men. The very foundation stones of organization are " Efficiency " and Service." Efficiency renders it easy to serve. Service Is conclusive proof of efficiency. So there you have it in a nut shell. There are in existance today larger and more prosperous commercial and in - ru.strial organizations than we ever dreamed of a decade or so ago. Efficiency made them possible and rendering real service has made them prosperous. You as fruit growers have a real service to perform in growing and packing fruits efficiently that you may do your part in the great organ - ization of supplying the public need for fruits and produce. Grow the best that it is possible to grow in your state. Pack and grade it care- fully and honestly. Not all apples grown will grade extra fancy. There are bound to be some choice and cull grades. But grade them lat these grades can be sold separately and at their market vaule. There are no finer apples produced than are grown right here &gt;od Old Nebraska; yet in the big stores in the larger cities and in the small towns, apples from Washington and Oregon occupy •lace of Honor. They are in demand by the public who read of r good qualities in advertisements and know of their uniform qual - by experience. My experience with Washington and Oregon apples is that when i of these apples is opened up and an apple picked at random from le top, one from the bottom and one from the middle and placed ong side one another they are so much a like that it would be hard to nguish the difference. In other words the Western Fruit Growers have found out that pays to grade honestly and advertise continually and thus gain a name for their apples which will cause a demand, giving them the pref - erence not only in demand but in price as well. The Western Fruit Grower found first however that to attain the heights they aim at, it was necessary to plant for a foundation, trees that bore fruit as near perfection as their soil would produce. Then by careful and scientific methods of spraying pruning, cultivation, picking and packing they were able to deliver an apple which was very much in demand. I honestly believe that if the Nebraska Fruit Growers would fol - low the Western Fruit- Grower as above outlined he would reap far </seg>
            <seg id="p061">54 greater financial benefits than does his Western brother. You are lo - cated right in the center of one of the greatest fruit consuming sec - tions of the United States, thus having advantage of low rates and a nearby demand. I admit that the far West produces apples somewhat superior in appearance, but hardly equal in quality to apples grown in Nebras - ka, and it is only a question of time as the trees grow older in the west and insects and fungi diseases increase when the appearance won't be quite so tempting as now. I have been told that already more culling has to be done out there than in former years to make their pack come up to grade. What our customers demand and for which they are willing to pay even a premium is uniform packed packages of fruit which they can send to their customers feeling It is not necessary to go through it from top to bottom to make sure that K is all good and of even grade. They want a barrel of apples that will run of uniform quality from top to bottom so that they can retail the last three or four pecks at the same price as the first. They know then just how much they are making and satisfied. But if they have to clean up the last of the bar - rel at cut prices because they are culls, they don't know for sure whether they are making a profit and are dissatisfied customers. And you may be sure they are not pushing sales and increasing consumption on a line of goods where they are uncertain of their net profit. For years my house has bought and sold a Brand of Lemons grown on a very large ranch in California where they use the greatest care in growing, irrigating, picking, washing, curing, packing, etc., that human ingenuity can invent; in order that they may produce a brand of lemons which look better, contain more juice and keeps far better than any lemon grown in the world. So much care is exercised that an egg could pass through the different processes and not be broken. The result is that they have more customers than they ran sup - ply. They are also able to charge more for their lemons to help pay for the extreme care they exercise. And that is just the goal for which fruit and vegetables growers should strive. It has been proven that Nebraska has the possibilities of produc - ing fine fruit and she is fast becoming known as a fruit state. Let's profit by the successes and failures of other states. LLook at New York State apples. So far as I have been able to rn only two cars of New York apples came to this state this last season. Why? No jobber or retailer can afford to handle them because they run so poor or are so badly diseased that they will not keep. I am told that In parts of New York City it is impossible to buy York State apples, which is not only contrary to good common business sense, but shows lack of home pride or patriotism and shows that they do not grow and pack good enough quality to conpete with </seg>

            <seg id="p063">PRODUCING AND MARKETING THE GRAPE CROP 55 the Western stock. Let's hope this condition never comes to Nebraska. Until this last season I have bought practically no Lancaster Coun - ty grapes because I could find no one who would pack them uniform - ly so that they would suit the retailer as well as shipped in grapes from regular grape growing section. A man owning a large vineyard in this county came to me and asked me if I could handle his crop of grapes. Yes, if you will pack them right. He certainly did pack them right. I used his entire crop and could have used several times as many as he could furnish and paid him the daily market price for them The result was that by packing his produce right he created a positive known demand which took care of the distribution of this crop. We were able to keep our money in Nebraska where there is some chance that part of it may come back to us, instead of kissing it good bye and sending it to some other state. The point I wish to make is that you grow just as good grapes in Nebraska and Lancas - ter County as anywhere in this country. Pack them right and they v. ill sell themselves. In passing I wish to state that right in Lancaster County there is very great need for the grape growers to organize and get everyone v. ho grows grapes in this county to pack his grapes right and I am sure that the Produce and Wholesalers of this City will agree to take every basket of them as fast as they are picked and packed at the prevailing market price. But they should all be in on it, for three or four on the outside running around over the city trying to market their grapes independently will pull the market price down. It never I I have touched briefly on the things which I feel will help you ■a producers most: namely, organization and proper growing and packing. If you aim high in the two points the distribution of your products will be added unto you, for buyers will be running after you instead of you trying to locate them. Then he who has served best will have profited most. The President: I think Hr. Burt has covered this proposition from start to finish, and shut off all chance for argument, and if there is no discussion on this paper we will go to the next paper which is by Mr. H. J. Letovsky, on the subject of "Producing and Marketing Grape Crop." PRODUCING AND MARKETING THE GRAPE CROP Mr. H. I. letovsky The President: Mr. Letvosky does not seem to be present with us this afternoon. I believe there will be an increasing demand for grapes. Mr. Andrews, who was the manager of our Fruit Growers Association in 1915, can tell you I think that we had a demand for something like three car loads of grapes to supply that demand in </seg>
            <seg id="p064">56 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL. SOCIETY Nebraska. It seems like something should be done. I would like to ask Mr. George Marshall if be would not open the discussion on this subject, since the speaker is not here. lMscusHion Mr. George Marshall: I am sure we need some encouragement plong that line. I cannot do anything, only just ramble a little on this subject a little bit, but possibly I can get it started to get some discussion. I will say this, that the Loess soil along the Missouri River has already shown us that we have a wonderful grape soil over there, and which is growing to produce more grapes than Nebraska can eat, or it should do it. This Letvosky, I visited his place this summer, and I am sorry that he is not here, because he is one of the up to date growers over there. I do not know how many acres he has in grapes, but it is a fair sized vineyard. I would say eight or ten acres anyhow of grapes, and he says it has been very profitable, and I have been in the vineyards down along Lake Erie, in that Northeastern Ohio, and Northern Pennsylvania, and Northwestern New York Grape District, along in there, and I will say this for his vineyard, and also for the neighboring vineyards: I never was in better vineyards than those were, and it seems to me, that the quality of the grapes was right up to what I found down there in the grape vineyards that are famous all over the United States. He stated that there was nothing at all in the way, and all they had to do was to have the will and exercise the knowledge that was already at hand, and the profits were almost as certain as a crop of corn. I would not state this as being a fact, but it seems to me that the yield was about $100 an acre. Now that was, the income of it, but I don't want you to take that down as a fact, because I did not make note of it, but it seemed to me like it was a lot of money in a small way, I talked to him about how much he could grow without being inconvenienced, and he said that a man could handle twenty-five or thirty acres very readily. When 1 com - pared it with apples, in talking to him, — of course he was a grape man, but he said I might talk apples until I was black in the face, that he was a believer that the grape industry had a place, and that he believed it was more certain than the apple, and while he would not make as big a yield some years, that the certainity of it made up for that. Now I do not know how far back it is productive, but I do know this, it is that way all over these Missouri River Hills, wherever you have a mind to plant a vineyard, and use common horse sense, and a good will, that you will have a good profitable project. I found two or three of his neighbors had vineyards about like his, and talked fully as encouragingly. This man Levtosky is a very conser - vative fellow; he does all he knows of, and a little bit more, and he is thoroughly up-to-date, and he is a man who is very much in love with this grape growing proposition. He says that it seemed with all the car loads of grapes they shipped out of Florence, it seemed like the </seg>
            <seg id="p065"/>
            <seg id="p066">57 more they produced the better prices they got from year to year, and he says they have a market so big, and so far from the New York market, and another thing that our grapes are ahead of the New York grapes, and that putting that all together it looked to him that it waa a better proposition in this country in the way of agriculture for the young man, than to take up grape growing along on those hills. Now I am not speaking for the country here, I am not saying anything against it, or in favor of it, but I do believe, that what can be done here, can be done in a great many places in Nebraska, eastern Ne - braska. We are fourteen miles away from the Missouri River at home, and I do not think that we have as good a location as we might have, but as I said before, this has been mighty like a crop of corn with us in fifteen years, on our little vineyard at home. About the age of grapes, we do not know the age of the grapes in this country yet. There is one vineyard there, two and one-half miles south of where I live, that is between fifty-five and sixty years old, and the vines are nearly all there, and they are producing just as good as ours, which are twenty-eight to twenty-nine years old, and I think ours are produc - ing just about as well as they were when they were ten years old. I think this is a good deal better grape country commercially than we had any idea it was. Mr. Williams: I am interested quite a good deal in the growing of grapes. There are some things I would like to say in regard to con - ditions here. I know what the conditions are, about which Mr. Mar - shall speaks of on the bluffs along the Missouri river. I lived in the bluffs for ten or twelve years, and I am a charter member of the Grape Growers Organization there. I know what they can do there, and I know from the experience I have had here for the last ten years, that we have been unable to meet their conditions there, or meet their results there, by quite a good deal. I cannot give you the exact figures, but their best averages there is around a thousand baskets to the acre. Our highest yield here from an eighteen acre vineyard, the total yield last year was around ten thousand baskets. Of course, if we had had all Concords, we would have had a different report. About two-thirds of the vineyards is Concords. We lack that loose bluff soil here, and that is where we fall short of the Omaha and Council Bluff grower*. And because of that, I think that is why we cannot obtain the results of those growers in Council Bluffs and Omaha. We have however a great future in Lancaster County, in the growing of grapes. I want to simp - ly point out one of the great obstacles to the successful production of grapes here, and that is the expense project of pruning. We have not mastered the problem, yet, although we are studying it; it cost us something over $300.00 the last two years to prune this eighteen-acre vineyard, and I am satisfied we have not got down to the successful solution of the problem yet. We have not learned the best methods quite. We are trying them out, and Mr. Babcock, our manager here, can tell you more in detail as to what those problems are, concerning </seg>
            <seg id="p067">58 his work, than I can. In the marketing of the grape, I feel satisfied in the experience of the year, that we can profit by Mr. Burt's sug - gestion here in letting the wholesaler be our distributing agent, we must either come to that, or else we must organize and do our own sell - ing. We must unite in some form or other in order to get the best results. The problem of marketing 1b a big one, and it is a matter of economy. 1 am satisfied with the experience of the last two years. where our largest crops had been produced to let some one who is thoroughly posted on the market, take care of our selling for us. Mr. Burt spoke about paying the market price each day. I have always felt rather a distrust of our wholesale men here, about the fixing of that price. For two or three years while I had charge of the marketing of our Sun Crest grapes. I endeavored to keep posted on the market, and I found by calling up the wholesale house occasionally, to find out what they were selling at, then I would get their figures, and they would give me the price they were holding them at that day, and when I would get down to the market. I found I was up against it. The figures he gave did not tell the truth and there were dealers here and there who were getting more or less money, and 1 had that same trouble in all lines of our produce that we put on the market. I do not want to say they are lying to me. but there is a nigger in the wood-pile some place, and we cannot harmonize on the price. It is only by some central co-operation system, that we can maintain a steady and e\ price. I just came to this conclusion, that we must either organ as growers and co-operate together with a certain business nianag or else we must put our produce in the hands of a firm already org: ired. I would like to hear from Mr. Babcock on this subject. Mr. Babcock: I do not think that I can tell you very much on pruning. I am busy at it, and 1 have been for months, and 1 expect to prune for the next two or three months, but 1 have not settled on one special way of pruning, as being absolutely the correct way. I can tell you some of the difficulties 1 have there in the orchard, and one is the substitution of types of pruning. The orchard had for years, and for all times, perhaps from the beginning, been pruned, ac - cording to the short arm or spur system, leaving two or three bud3. When the long arm pruning came out, or was introduced, the long arm system, we made a radical change there, of one block to that type and found that it was a very agreeable type to follow. It is easy to prune that way, and when one has been in the habit of pruning the long arm system, I believe they can hardly .get back to the old type again, but the results there with us, did not seem to conform to the bulletin we received on that subject. In the first place changing from the short arm pruning or spur system to the long ami pruning, where we leave anywhere from eight to ten to twelve buds according to the size of the cane, and not so many canes, and trying to leave the best among the buds as we did in the short arm system, we found the re - sults were to the contrary. In the block we have Introduced the long </seg>
            <seg id="p068">59 arm system of pruning in, we have the most abundant wood growth. We have eradicated the old wood; have made the vineyard good in that respect, but we have so many new vigorous and beautiful canes, why more than that we are swamped with them. And where we have the long arm style of pruning, the canes we have cut off, will some - times be nearly two or three feet long. So we are getting back to the long arm pruning again. Now that has been one hinderance there with us, the changing from the spur to the long arm system of prun - ing has increased the amount of wood in the vineyard, and of course, has increased the pruning expense. But I am trying a new tack there by leaving a greater number of buds, and changing the vine by this wood growth where a vine consists of a single trunk, and some four or five laterals, from that, I am getting pretty good results. Where the vine has been cut back, and there has been some four or five or six branches coming up from the root, and no central stalk then we can renew that without shocking that vine by removing the oldest one of the four, five or six, there we are getting better results, so that this year, we are leaving vines there where we reduced the old wood, by cutting back to the lowest strong limb, by leaving two or three buds, and not trying to produce such a shock to the vine. Now in that long arm pruning, we did not get the amount of grapes, that we did in the other style of pruning. I think it was too sudden a change from spur system to the new system, and I rather expect better results this year, but it produced such a shock there, that we have practically turned the growing power of those vines this year to new wood growth. There are other troubles about pruning, and plenty of them that we run across each day. I have trouble in keeping those vines from grow - ing too much, and the more vigorous pruning I do there, the more vigorous growth I get, and my vines are getting bigger all the time. Now at one time, I could prune 1,000 feet a day. and I cannot prune feet a day to save my life. Mr. Williams: I would like to hear from Mr. Ohler on this subject. Mr. Ohler: I do not know as I have very much to say after Mr. Babcock's talk on pruning. His experience, and Mr. William's ex - perience has covered a period of about ten years, whereas mine has been almost wholly a development proposition at the present time. We had a partial crop this year. The system of pruning and the amount of growth I got from different systems of pruning, of course will have to be determined as to which one is the best. This vineyard I speak of is a tract of thirty-five acres; I have one of the largest vine - yards in this part of the state, or perhaps in the state, and the profit this season was a pretty good one, considering the fact that it was only four years old. About $50.00 return per acre on a total of thirty-five acres. The President: Is that net or gross returns? Mr. Ohler: Gross returns. Mr. Marshall spoke of the number of </seg>

We have on this farm a small vineyard of three - quarters of an acre, and two years ago, I got from that three-quarters tan acre 1,200 baskets at about 21c a basket, for the whole crop, to the marketing through the wholesale house or through an As - iation, I do not feel as Mr. Williams does at all about the retailer the wholesaler, in so far as confidence or lack of confidence in them. I have every confidence in them absolutely. I felt all the time that the wholesaler or the commissioner was the best friend we had. because I found this in my experience of about five years of handling grapes on this local market, that any time I could get as much for my grapes or apples as the commission man was getting, that I was getting a pretty good price, and but for the commission man. 1 would have to take a very small price indeed, and as far as getting the price each day from this merchant, I found that they varied often times, and that the dealer was very apt to see that the price was lower than it really was, but by watching the price he was selling his stuff at. I found that the retailer was the man who was doing more mis-representing. Mr. Williams: Do I understand then that you would rather de pend upon the wholesaler than the dealer? Mr. Ohler: Well it has been my experience with the price that the wholesaler gave me each day by learning through a responsible dealer, 1 found that that was nearly always correct. Often times it «a» misrepresented, but on the whole it was nearly always correct. I do not see any reason why this soil will not produce as much as the soil along the river. Perhaps a part of it is a little bit strong. I found in this thirty-five acre vineyard where the soil is too heavy, it produces a heavy growth of cane, and the grape is harder to handle, and more danger of frost. The age of this three-quarter vineyard I spoke of is about forty-two years, and it is on high ground. Mr. Marshall spoke of the crop being a sure one. Last year, in 1915, we had perhaps as good a set of grapes as you could possibly get from any vines, and on the 28th day of May or April 1, I think it was, the frost took nearly every grape we had. Now I do not think that would be true had those vines been a year or two older, or at the age when we would consider they would bear. I think it was practically or wholly do to the fact that the vines were young, and that the ground had been not thoroughly culti - vated the year before, and some of the pruning was done quite late, and we started the cultivation a little too early in the spring I think, and they were only three or four days too far advanced, to stay away from the frost. I think a man should be very careful not to start his vines too early by cultivating. A Spectator: While I am not a grape grower, but Mr. Marshall if he is present will recognize me as being from Arlington and I want to speak from what I have heard said regarding this matter of organi - sation. In the Association, I have reference to, at the time of picking and shipping, this general manager remains right at the car, and he is </seg>

            <seg id="p071">SOME COMMON HORTICULTURAL INSECT PESTS 61 there to inspect everyone's grapes that they bring to the Association. And they have never had enough to fill the orders, the general manager begins to look out early in the season as regards the transportation to the different parts of the country, and makes arrangements (or ship - ping. This inspector takes out of each load a certain number and weighs them on the scales to see if they are fully balanced up to the eight pound standard, and further more endeavors to inspect them more or less, and each basket as I understand, or have been told has the initial of those of the Association who ship it. so that in case of any trouble it is located, and traced back to the man who did it. Often times many of them fall a little short, and have the privilege of taxing the basket back home, and filling it up. From what I have heard them say. those who have had more experience than I have had, they con - sidered it a very nice arrangement, and a money maker, and I often tiint's heard them tell of getting from twelve to fifteen hundred baskets from an acre. Formerly, before they formed this organization, they were at the mercy of going to Omaha. Now they have this location right near by, and they load right directly into the car, and when it it rilled, off it goes, and another one is put in. I speak not from my own personal knowledge as a grape grower, but from what I have known and heard. It is demonstrated that the hilly ground near Florence. and on the West side up and down the river there, is as well adapted to raising grapes as any you will find in New York State or any place lse. This vegetable mold is pretty nearly washed off on this ground. The President: These discussions, have all been very interesting, and it is now about a quarter after four, and perhaps we had better adjourn, but we will have the Secretary's report first, so that the Audit - ing Committee can work on that. I have appointed as Judges of the fruit on exhibition over there, Professor Howard. Professor Hoppert, and Professor Cooper. They have no fruit on exhibition, and are all experts in that line. 4:30 P. M., January 16th, 1917. The Society adjourned to meet at 9 o'clock A. M., the following morning. 10:30 A. M., January 17th, 1917. The Society met pursuant to adjournment, and the following pro - ceedings were had and done: The President: The first subject on the program is "Some Com - mon Horticultural Insect Pests, and Their Control," by Professor Myron H. Swenk, Professor of Economic Entomology, of the University of Nebraska, who will talk to you upon that subject. SOME «X»IMOX HORTICn/TURAL/ 1N8ECT PESTS, AND THEIR CONTROL. By Professor Myron H. Swenk, University of Nebraska. Professor Swenk: Mr. President, and members of the State Horticultural Society. When Secretary Duncan invited me to talk on </seg>
            <seg id="p072">62 this subject, I inferred he wished me to speak particularly on fruit pests but in the course of our conversation he suggested to me, that per - haps we might vary from this program, and consider some of the pests attacking vegetables. Inasmuch as this is a rather often neg - lected subject. I felt that this suggestion was a good one, so what I shall say this morning shall largely be in connection with vegetable pests. The last five or six years has seen a number of developments of varying importance in connection with means of control of vegetable pests. A few of these have come to our notice, and have been tested out more or less completely. I thought it might be well to bring to your attention a few of these. One of the collection we sometimes have in growing of beans, particularly in the fields, or other plants in the green house is attacked by the tiny mite which we call Red Spider. This little creature, almost microscopic in size. Is not really an insect, but most of the studies in consection with have been done by Entomologists. A number of years ago, the attack by the Red Spider on some of the beans at the University caused us to try out the num - ber of preparations for it. The experiments seemed to show that the use of tobacco sprays were not wholly satisfactory Of course, in dealing with this little sucking creature, contact sprays must be used. Knowing that mites of all sorts are particularly susceptible to sulphur, we tried sulphur in various combinations. The ordinary method is to spray with sulphur and soap suds, using about one ounce of the ordinary flowers of sulphur to a gallon of weak soap suds. There are difficulties in connection with this. Difficulties in getting the sul - phur in suspension. It does not dissolve nor does it mix well with even warm water. And even when applied with soap, and acting as a sprayer, it is a rather difficult thing to use satisfactorily. Lime sul - phur such is as used as a fungicide is a better preparation, but the difficulty with lime sulphur is to get it to spread well. It has a tendency to concentrate in drop lets on the leaves and not spreads sufficiently to get into contact with the bodies of a number of these Red Spiders. The addition of soap which acts so well as a spreader with tobacco does not work so well with lime sulphur. The soap tends to precipi ate the combination in the lime sulphur when they are together, and we get very poor results. About that time we noted that the California Station was recommending the use of flour paste in connection with lime sulphur as a spreader, and this was tried, and it was found it acted very advantageously. The efficiency was in - creased about 38 per cent according to even more recent government study. The efficiency of lime sulphur is alone is scarcely 60 per cent: when used with the flour paste, practically all or about 99 per cent of the Red Spiders are killed. The original California formula was us - ing simply flowers of sulphur, and water in connection with flour paste. They used 15 pounds of flowers of sulphur to 100 gallons of water, putting in 4 pounds of flour paste. When lime sulphur is used, the commercial lime sulphur testing in the neighborhood of 36 per cent. </seg>
            <seg id="p073">SOME COMMON HORTICULTURAL INSECT PESTS 63 is diluted one part to fifteen of water, and to each 100 gallons of this diluted lime sulphur, four pounds of flour paste is added. This causes the material to spread rapidly and evenly over the leaf, and coming in contact with each little red spider it causes it's death. The flour paste is first made up into a batter and cooked so that a paste is formed, and then this is added and stirred in with the spray solu - tion. To make four gallons of the flour paste, four pounds of flour are neeatsary. It has been found that this flour paste in itself has some properties if used at double the strength, that is a pound to 100 pounds of water, will alone kill the red spiders. This is an improved method of dealing with the problem, of beans in the field, for the red spider is becoming a pest; simply add to the sulphur solution some flour paste. Another point which seems of interest at this time is the problem 'i! potato beetle control. The potato beetle is one of those insect pests, which every potato grower must take into account. It has been probably the chief pest of potatoes since that period a num - ber of years when it swept over the country from the West Eastward, and became an enemy of the cultivated potato. You are familiar in general with the way this insect works. A comparatively few of the beetles probably winter over as beetles in the soil, or other protected nooks, and appear on the potato plants in the spring and lay a large number of eggs, the number varying from five hundred to a thousand eggs according to the individual, and these eggs hatching in a week or less, means that from five hundred to a thousand beetle larvae will be eating the foilage of that potato soon after the appearance of the over-wintered beetles. Now this begins to demand immediate at - tention on the part of the potato grower. The use of arcenicals has been the chief reliance. The Paris Green was the first arcenical to be used an employed, and this was first used about 1868 and for a good many years, was almost the entire reliance of the potato grower fighting these beetles. The Paris Green was usually used at the rate of a pound, or a pound and a quarter to 100 gallons of water, or Bordeaux mixture when this later came to be employed as a fungi - cide in the spraying. Paris Green however had a number of deflciences, among which was the fart that it was not very easily held in sus - pension, and that it did not adhere or cling to the foliage well being easily washed off with a heavy rain, so that sometimes repeated ap - plications were necessary. Also Paris Green had the weakness of burning or scorching the foliage, because of the presence of free arsenic, unless lime was added to counteract this defect. For this reason the use of arsenate of lead came to be practiced in connection with controlling potato beetles after it's usefullness as an insecticide on the foliage of fruits had been brought out. This remains better in suspension. It adheres exceedingly well to the foliage so that repeat - ed applications are not necessary. It has but little free arsenic, and burning is exceptional when it is used. On potato foliage it might </seg>
            <seg id="p074">64 be used as strong as ten pounds to one hundred gallons without serious burning. This however is entirely unnecessarily strong for killing the beetles. So that arsenate of lead came to be used a good deal for the potato beetle. Even more recently it was found that another arsentical bad some points of superiority over arsenate of lead, and this was arsenide of zinc. We used this material two or three years ago and found that used at the rate of four pounds to one hundred gallons of water it remained in suspension as well as arsenate of lead, and it adhered to the leaves nearly as well, and that used at this strength no burning whatever would be noticeable. It seemed that this was destined to become the most useful poison for the Colorado potato beetle, but with the coming of the war, the whole thing has been up - set. The price of arsenicals has risen greatly, and their relative price has been practically made prohibitive. At the present time perhaps we must fall back upon Paris Green, or perhaps arsenate of lead to meet this problem. Paris Green now retails at about 60c a pound. and used at the ordinary" rate, this means that 100 gallons of spray can be made for about 75c-. Arsenate of lead will cost considerably more than this to make up at the required strength. It will depend on your judgment as to whether one or repeated applications will be necessary, as to whether Paris Green will be the cheaper or not. Cer - tainly all hopes of using arsenide of zinc in this connection for the present is to be abandoned. A question which often comes up in connection with the control of vegetables pests, is how to control cabbage worms. The remedy involves the use of some stomach poison at an early stage in the development of the worm. Paris Green is in common use in this con - nection, and if not used with discretion and care, it is a dangerous meth - od. Paris Green is usually used at the rate of a pound to 50 gallons of water. When the young plants are set, or probably after they are set out, they get their first spraying. This will destroy the first worms which appear. Additional sprayings may be made if necessary, up to the time the heads begins to form, after which it is undesirable to continue arsenical sprays. From this time on the treatment, if furth - er treatment is necessary, will have to depend upon non-poisonous or comparative nonpoisonous materials. Among these, probably the most satisfactory is kerosene mulsion, made according to the standard formula and applied so that it will reach the worms as far as possible where they are working in the heads. This is not the only effective insecticide, but it is the cheapest and effective one. The experience is however that if the worms are kept down during the early stages of growth, of the plant, that ususally the injury to follow is com - paratively slight. The danger of arsenicals has been over-estimated. It has been found that one week after the application of Paris Green If an ordinary rain occurs, that no trace of the poison can be found on the leaves. It has been found that in three weeks after the ap - lication or at most a month if in the lack of any heavy rains, the </seg>
            <seg id="p075"/>
            <seg id="p076">SOME COMMON HORTICULTURAL INSECT PESTS 65 arsenicals has disappeared. Furthermore it would require the eat - ing of a large quantity of cabbage to injure any one. Professor Gillette of the Colorado Station has estimated that one would have to eat twenty-eight heads of cabbage in order to get enough poison to prove injurious. And yet in spite of this, it is well to use the precautions of which I have mentioned, simply of using arsenicals during the early part of the spraying program, and when later applications are neces - sary to substitute the kerosene emulsion. he vegetable pests that we find causing a good deal of njury is the little plant louse, which works on the inside of cucum- ber and mellon leaves. It is called the Mellon Aphis. You are familiar with its work, and how it appears and developes very rapidly, and Etuses a killing and dying of the leaves, and in a very short time, a week or ten days it may destroy an entire patch of these plants. Up to about 1906 or 1907 the commoniy recommended treatment for melon aphis was kerosene emulsion. Practically trying this out however, hat it was not a satisfactory killing agent. Kerosene einul- r lade at a strength that would destroy these aphids, we found would almost invariably greatly injure or kill the plant. These plants b&gt;inp very tender required a killing agent as energetic as an insecticide kerosene emulsion, not as destructive to the plant foliage. Con- sider experimentations with various washes began in 1910 and con - tinued for the next three years, to the conclusion that on the whole the tobacco washes gave the best results, and we found that this if properly and promptly applied would solve the melon aphis problem. The problem consist largely in applying them quickly enough. While the life history of the melon aphis is not known, it seems certain ii winters both as an egg and as a partly or fully grown insect. These appear on the vines quite early, certainly not later than the time they begin to run. The first ones that appear are winged ones, and these produce young aphids very rapidly. Through the interven - tion of eggs to producing living insects alive, so that with in a few days a few appear as winged individuals, the progeny is enough to abundantly cover the leaves. They cause the rapid shriveling and dying of the leaves, and the death of the plant. After the leaves have begun to crawl it is difficult if not impossible to apply effective remedical measures, but by watching the vines, and noting the first appearance of the winged flies, and then when the young will begin to be produced noticeably and considerably before the crawling of the leaves begins, going over the patch and spraying with a tobacco spray. The spraying process can be made more easy by using what is termed a hand sprayer, bending a piece of gas pipe at the end of which the nosel is attached almost at right angles, and using this to get the spray on the underside of the leaves where the insects are at work. Any tobacco spray is effective. We tried first the ordinary 2.7 per cent nicotine solution. This did well, diluted one part to 50 of water. More recently the preparation known as Black Leaf Forty, well known to </seg>
            <seg id="p077">66 most of you has proved a little bit more economical. This is a 40 per cent solution of nicotine sulphate, and diluted one part to 1 of water, and forms a proper spraying solution for the melon aphis. This sells for about $10.75 I believe a gallon. Of course a gallon will make enough almost to spray an entire orchard, because it is diluted from 1000 to 1600 times depending upon the aphis, which you are fighting. For the melon aphis 1 to 1000 is a good dilution. The material known as nirnfurip containing 40 per cent of nicotine il a. lighter but more volitile preparation, but will answer the same pur- pose. Do not attempt the use of Kerosene emulsion as some of the b letins now recommend. Another aphis which in recent years has been giving us trouble is the cabbage aphis. This has been workir i ticularly, but also on cabbage. We have found this can by this same spray. In fact pretty nearly al plants Mm rapidly to tobacco spray. In addition to this melon three or four other important pests we receive a great many requests of dealing with these insects. Two mention specifically. First there ar&lt; which work on cucumber and niel these. One is striped lengthwise, cucumber beetle, and the other is know this as the spotted cucumber serious, because not only does it inj melons, but as a larvae, it works often the plant. While there is no troying pest. It can to a large exte: ucumber plants or information as or three of these ' the small black ar in vines. There are and you know this potted with black sv The for the leaves of t on the roots debt remedy for the it ■nt be controlled as a pest. The best treatment is a combination of arsen Bordeaux mixture. The arsenate of lead acting as a stomach poison - ing, and the Bordeaux mixture as a repellant. Neither of these are used at very great strength for the tender leaves demand a reduced strength. The Bordeaux mixture is usually used on the three-four fifty, that is three pounds of copper sulphate, and four pounds of lime, to fifty gallons of water, and to this is added the arsenate of lead at the rate of four pounds. The leaves are sprayed with this material, and it inheres long enough to form a repelling and killing agent in a con - siderable degree. If it is not available, the insect may be driven off with some success by the use of thoroughly slacked lime. Neither of these methods however affords a complete protection to the bloss - oms, which are sometimes injured in large numbers. No feasible meth - od of dealing with this pest has been as yet worked out, as far as I know. The earlier stages of the plant may be controlled by means of artiicial covering, but after a time when the plant begins to run to vines these coverings must be removed. Another one I have in mind is the common squash bug, it is a difficult insect to control. It is a large gray bug that works on the </seg>
            <seg id="p078">67 squash sucking the sap from the vines, and causing a sort of poison - ous injection at tbe point of attack, which helps to kill the vine. It is difficult to destroy because it is impervious to contact sprays, when it becomes adult. By watching these bugs however, when they first appear, and looking for their brownish eggs on the underside of tr.j leaves, a good many of them can be prevented in that why, by spray - ing with kerosene emulsion, made according to the standard formula and diluted ten times with water, and we can kill the young bugs the second mold. After this they become too strong. even for kerosene emulsion, and this method must be abandoned. Only hand picking from that time forth will destroy these bugs. ne more point, and I will close. The squash vine borer is an very injurous to squashes. Squashes of all kinds are attacked. nsect works in the vine, boring out the insides. and causing the in e from the point of attack outward. In as much as they jrk near the base, usually the whole vine dies from the at- n up the vine at the point where you find the dis spot you will usually find one or more of these worms, nearly *n and a large fleshy catipillar working on the inside. This u hi' prevented rather than be destroyed, and the prevention insists in locating the field in which the squash are grown In it haves the vine, and goes into the ground, and remains ntil spring, and if the field is placed away from the old loths must find the new field to lay their eggs there, in order isect over.

It is not so difficult to sup- if a longitudinal slit is made at the colored spot, and the worn out at the point of contact. Usually this vine will recover, u 1 has been practically killed before this attention is given to it. It These are some of the things which I had in mind, as some of the new or valuable developments along the line of control of vegetable pests. And as I know I have used my time, I will conclude at this point The President: The hour has arrived for the election of of - ficers. It has been the custom of the Society, and as our members usually handle this matter with dispatch, we will take it up at (his time. I will read the present officers of the Society, and ask for nominations in the order in which they appear. Your Chairman. President, R. F. Howard, is First Vice-President, and L. C. Chapin is Second Vice-President, and Peter Youngers is Treasurer. Our Secre - tary is elected by the Board so I do not have to read his name. O. A. </seg>
            <seg id="p079">68 Marshall, W. A. Harrison, and A. J. Brown are the directors. Nomin - ations are now in order for President of the Society. Mr. G. A. Marshall: Our present Vice-President, Professor Howard Is naturally in line for the Presidency. I do not know where we could ever find a more fitting or able candidate, and therefore I will place his name in nomination for President. If there are no other nominations I move that the rules be suspended, and the Sec - retary instructed to cast the unanimous ballot of the Society for Professor Howard for President. Seconded and carried. The President: Professor R. F. Howard has been chosen by the Society for their next President. The next will be the election of the First Vice-President. Mr. Brown: I will place in nomination for the First Vice-Presi - dent, Mr. Chapin, who is now our Second Vice-President. Mr. Barnard: I move that the rules be suspended and the Secre - tary be instructed to cast the unanimous ballot of the Society for L. C. Chapin as First Vice-President. Seconded and carried. The President: Mr. L. C. Chapin has been elected to the First Vice-Presidency of this Society. The next nomination in order is nom - ination for Second Vice-President. Mr. Howard: I would like to nominate Mr. Bliss of Minden for Second Vice-President. Mr. Brown: I will move that the rules be susupended and the Secretary be instructed to cast the unanimous ballot of this Society for Mr. Bliss of Minden as Second Vice-President. Seconded. Carried. The President: Mr. Bliss of Minden has been elected as our Second Vice-President. The next matter in order is the elction of a Trasurer. Mr. C. S. Marshall: I want to place in nomination the name of Peter Youngers as Treasurer of the Society. I think Mr. Youngers is serving his twenty-fifth or twenty-sixth year and he has been a very able treasurer. Seconded. Mr. Marshall: I move that the rules be suspended, and the Sec - retary be instructed to cast the unanimous vote of the Society for Mr. Peter Youngers for Treasurer. Seconded. Carried. The President: The Secretary has cast the unanimous ballot of the Society for Mr. Youngers, and he has been elected our next Treasurer. There is to be one director elected. Mr. G. A. Marshall of Arlington goes out. Mr. G. A. Marshall: I have served this Society in some official capacity for about eighty or a hundred years, it seems to me: I have got all the honor there is in it, and the Lord knows enough of the work. I would like to decline in favor of Art Shubert. Mr. C. G. Marshall: I move that the rules be suspended, and that the Secretary be instructed to cast the unanimous ballot of this </seg>

Shubert has been elected as a direc - tor to fill the vacancy upon the Board of Directors. Mr. Bassett who has started this Hall of Fame in Agricultural Achievements looked over the reports of our Society, and suggested that we have added to our list of Committees a Historian whose work should be to go through the reports of the Society, and make a digest of the matter* that have been presented by different members in the past, up to data, and with the hope that a book might be compiled to which we could turn immediately without looking through all these forty-seven re - ports, and get the meat of the subject matter that each man has pre - sented his talks before the Society. The Chair would entertain a motion to add to our list Committee, a Committee or a man who would be designated as the Historian of the Horticultural Society. Mr. Brown: Is Mr. Bassett a member of this Society? The President: I think so. Mr. Brown: I do not know of a man either in or out of the Society who is better qualified for that than Mr. Bassett. .Mr. Christy: Wouldn't it be well to let that matter rest until we confer with Mr. Bassett. I think it is a mighty fine propostion. There is Ex-Governor Furnas, and a lot of those old fellows who have put in their life work for the State, and they have experimented and done so much for the State that they never got anything out of that, and I think it is fitting that this Society should place their pic- tures in this hall, and I think the Society should take this thing up, and we could make an index of the things they have given the State, that will come in the reports. The President: We can take that matter up when Mr. Bassett gets here and explains it. He will be in this afternoon, and at that time we will call on him for a few remarks, and complete the mat - ter. Mr. Christy: I will make a motion right now to appoint a Com - mittee to that effect. Seconded. Carried. Mr. Brown: I move that the Society endorse the request of the Regents of the University for an appropriation of at least ten thous - and dollars for biennium, for Entomological research work. A Member: I heartily favor that motion. I believe it is one of the most important things that this Society can do at this time for the benefit of the growers of the State. The vegetable growers are inter - ested particularly in something of this kind. The address we listen - ed to this morning is of very great importance to the truck gardeners of this state, and if a bulletin could be printed, giving the informa - tion that we listened to this morning, it would be of very great value. and there is great need for something of this kind, and we are assured from the way the small appropriations have been expended by the </seg>
            <seg id="p082">70 University, that this sum is appropriated by the Legislature will be expended wisely, and therefore 1 again second the motion. The President: Just a suggestion before I put the motion. I doubt if you can get the money, and I doubt if the Society can get the money. We have tried to get this thing time and time again. There is no reason why the Entomological department is not entitled to get a slice of the Smith-Lever Fund that Mr. Howard mentioned, if they will go out and make demonstrations, which is what the Horticulturists of the state want. I am glad to put the motion, and all of that, but time and again, I have argued with some of our members that thf is a way to get this and a way not to get this. Professor Howard: The remarks of mine yesterday regardi extension work of Horticulture, I referred to the object the extension movement, and the source of the fund. That nt has to be spent for demonstrations. I am of the opinion that money Mr. Brown had reference to, would be spent primaril; investigational work, and you cant do that and receive any po the Smith-Lever Funds. Furthermore I would like to sa benefit of the Society that this ten thousand dollars per bienniu Entomological work is already included in the Regent's ■ legislature, and as I take it Mr. Brown's motion was to the c the Society wanted to go down 01 record as approvin request. Mr. Brown: That is it, and furthermore I do not w ish in this matter at all. I did not state for Horticult gation, but for general agriculture. As 1 understan K that was required to spend this irformation over the State from my salary as a University Professor. But there was a questioning letter sent out to all the States in the I'nion to find out just what all the States in the union were doing in this respect, and while I haven't all those figures here, I have sufficient of them to explain what I have to •ay. Thirty or twenty-five states reported that they si)ent an aver Of $12,584.25 per annum aside from what they give to their College for instructional work for this purpose. That includes the States right around us. These are divided in various ways. Forty-one states re - porting the average was just a little less than this, and the average of sixteen states reporting was that they had $2200.00 a year for ac - tual field expense of this kind of work. They also had a first and sec - ond assistant. The first assistant getting in the neighborhood of the Entomologist should cover all , of agriculture, and not necessary for Horticulture alone. ir» Professor Bruner: I just want to say that somehow or otln-r Ne- braska is way down below the lowest other state in the Union with respect to money spent for investigation of insect life, and I do not know why it is, whether I have not been aggressive enough in asking for things, or whether it was supposed I should know all these thingE without investigation, and then should go out and spend the monej </seg>

Now Nebraska has spent to assistance one quarter of one man's salary during the year, and one half of the other man's salary during the year. That is all that has been paid out in the way of salary. I have requested the Regents to put in an estimate of ten thousand dollars for the bieniums, to be divided about as follows: One fourth of one man's salary and one half of the other man's salary, and the full time for a field time, which he would be engaged In the field work, for the entire year. Two hundred and fifty dollars for stationery and postage; Seven hundred and fifty dollars for printing reports bulletins and circulars; Seven hundred and fifty dollars to take up in addition to take up insect work, work upon mice, rabbits, and rats and other pests of the kind; seven hundred fifty dollars for insect investigations; four hundred dollars for the extension of im - ported nursery stock, and greenhouse plants and things of that kind, making a total of five thousand dollars per annum, and ten thousand dollars for the bienium. I do not see where any of those can be cut in least, and do anything like the work that will compare with the of the states in the Union that are doing this work. The President: I am sure that the Society will act favorably pon this. The motion is that all those in favor of the Society going n record as urging the legislature to grant the requests that the Re- gents have made for this appropriation signfy by saying "I." Carried.

Marshall or Arlington on the subject "Varieties of Fruit for the Home Orchard and Garden." VARIETIES OP FRUIT FOR THE HOME ORCHARD AND GARDEN By C. G. Marshall, Arlington. Home orchard planting in the central west has undergone a great change in the past twenty years. Previous to this time much planting of a semi-commercial nature was done on the farms and from fifty to four or five hundred apple trees comprised the common farm apple orchard in Eastern Nebraska. Also peach planting had its turn on a scale larger than required for the home use. as well as Cherry, Plum, Grapes and Berries, and more often this planting was done by those having very little knowledge of the care and culture that the trees and plants should receive. This worked very well when the country was new and the orchards were free from Coddling moth, scab, rusts and other troublesome </seg>
            <seg id="p084">72 insects and funguous diseases. However, about the time that a large percentage of these semi-commercial orchards and fruit plantations began to bear, one after another of the more troublesome insects and diseases made their appearance and not only made the fruit acreage unprofitable to the general farming operation, but often reduced the home supply of fruit to a mimimum and of inferior quality. From this time on, fruit planting in Nebraska began to adjust itself to the needs of the grower. Plantings were largely reduced to home orchard proposition by general farmers and home builders or were made on strictly commercial scales by those who were making this phase of agriculture an important part of their business. Assuming that the home planting at the present time, and in th future will occupy from one to three acres of ground, depending o course on the supply of fruit needed by the family and the inclinatioi of the home owner to plant, and care for trees and plants, the follow ing list of trees and plants in the proportions indicated are suggestci and will give a continuous supply ci fresh fruit in about the amount needed throughout the season. Each will require about two acres o CHERRY — 4 Early Richmond, 4 Montmorency, 4 English M PLUMS — 2 Wyant, 2 Wolf, 2 America, 2 Burwood. PEACH — 3 Champion, 3 Wright. GRAPES — 12 Moores Early, 12 Concord, 12 Worden, 12 Niagra RASPBERRIES — 25 Cumberland, 25 St. Regis. BLACKBERRIES — 50 Snyder. CURRANT — 12 Fays Prolific, 12 White Grape Currant. GOOSEBERRY — 12 Downing, 12 Houghton. STRAWBERRY — 100 Progressive, 50 Americus, 50 Superb When the planting is made larger or smaller, the number of trees and plants of each variety should be increased or decreased ac - cordingly except perhaps with the crabs, sweet and very early apples. For the Western half of the state, where the rain-fall is less and the climate more severe a somewhat different selection of varieties is rquired. The writer would recommend the following varieties, which •re less in number than the above list, and would increase the nuni- ground for its planting. They are comprised of about fifty app trees, twelve cheery trees, eight plum trees, (eastern halt of the Statt fifty grapes vines, fifty raspberry plants, fifty blackberry plant twelve current bushes, twelve gooseberry bushes and two hundrt strawberry plants. For the Eastern half, or the general farming se tion of the state, the writer would use the following varieties in aboi tbe proportions indicated.

It la one of the hardiest of apples and can be grown with success through - out the Northwest. Is an excellent early cooking apple and makes good sauce when not more than half grown making it really the first apple that can be used in early summer. Ripens in August. May be used for sauce late in July. Especially desirable for sauce and pies. YELLOW TRANSPARENT The best early eating apple adapted to Nebraska, ripens the latter part of July or First of August. Is also good for culinary purposes. Fruit miduiu size, pale yellow color, skin tender. A good bearer. Tree is vigorous but slightly subject to blight. CHANANGO This variety is a fair annual bearer in the eastern half of the state. While it never bears heavily, the excellent quality makes it a very desirable home apple. Also a good "Close market" apple but will not stand shipping. Ripens late in August or early September. MAIDEN BLUSH The Maiden Blush variety Is a very good variety for eastern Ne - braska both for home and marketing purposes. It is medium sized, pale yellow with a bright blush. Ripens about the first of September. Quality excellent for cooking and baking and many esteem it for de - sert purposes. WEALTHY The Wealthy like the Duchess is the very hardiest of apples and a favorite for both home and market purposes everywhere. Fruit is a bright red, above medium size, very juicy and is recognized as one of the best autumn cooking apples. It also mellows up and makes a very good desert apple if laid away in a cool place for ten days or two weeks. The tree commences to bear young and is a heavy bearer. The fruit ripens in September but may be held in storage until mid-winter. </seg>
            <seg id="p087">74 FAMEUSE (Snow) This variety is not so prolific as some other in this section, but it's very excellent desert qualities make it desirable to the home or - chard. The fruit is medium in size — greenish red to deep red in color. Ripens in October, and if stored in cool place will keep until Xmas. GRIMES I An apple of the highest quality and is a favorite with many as desert apple as well as for the different culinary purposes. A beau - tiful golden-yellow colored apple in medium size. It's season of use - fulness being from October first to January. JONATHAN This is another high quality apple and is well adapted to the eastern half of Nebraska. It's season of ripening is slightly later than the Grimes and will keep from thirty to forty days longer in common storage. The tree is an early and abundant bearer. Probably the most popular eating apple grown west of New York and Virginia. DELICIOUS This variety is another high quality desert apple. It is as it name implies really a delicious apple. While it is comparatively ne in Nebraska, it has shown up excellently all over the eastern half i the state and promises to be one of the most reliable varieties. Tl season for the Delicious corresponds very closely to that of the Jon than. WINDSOR The Windsor is high quality, sub-acid apple and a favorite partial to a mild flavored fruit. It is medium to large and in color. Tree is moderate grower and early annual bearer November to February. WINESAP This is a favorite family variety in the West. Responds w good care and is one of the most dependable when properly carei Medium size, dark red, sub-acid ai&gt;d of excellent quality. Ver sirable for desert and culinary purposes. It's season is from Dec&lt; to May. BEN DAVIS The "Ben Davis" is in bad with a great many people, yet it is one of the most dependable apples grown in eastern Nebraska. While the quality is only poor to fair, Ben Df.vis apples are much better than no apples at all. It will come as near bearing fruit under adverse con - ditions as any other variety grown in this section. It is excellent for cooking and «baking. Season from December to May. JANET This variety is recommended only for the home orchard. It is a very late keeper and should be put away to be used late in the winter </seg>
            <seg id="p088">FRUIT FOR HOME ORCHARD AND GARDEN 75 and during the spring months. It is a juicy, high quality apple and a favorite when at it's best late in the season. It is much better than it's appearance implies. FLORENCE A good crab apple, suitable for jellying and preserving purposes. Hipens about September first. PRICES SWEET Very prolific, fair quality sweet apple. Ripens in September. Excellent for pickling and preserving. PEARS Pears are gaining in favor with Eastern Nebraska planters trom year to year. With a better knowledge of varieties, soil adaptibility and culture, good success is being had with pears in the eastern part of the State. A few trees only, however, should be planted as the varieties that are well adapted to Nebraska conditions are mostly canning pears and the home orchardist needs only a supply for canning and pre - serving purposes. KEIFFER This variety among the Pear corresponds closely to the Ben Davis among the apples. The quality is only poor to fair and the fruit can be used only for canning purposes. The tree, however, l» a hardy strong grower, quite free from blight and a regular bearer. SECKEL This is another variety that is really only suitable for canning urposes. The fruit is small but when it starts bearing it is a prolific and regular bearer. DWARF DUCHESS The Duchess is a large canning pear. Dwarfing it by grafting on the quince root brings it into bearing at an early age and also seems to make is more resistant to blight which is the pear's worst enemy in the central west. CHERRY EARLY RICHMOND The Standard early cherry throughout the State. It is an excel - lent canning and preserving variety though somewhat sour to eat from the hand. It is a hardy, strong grower and one of the most resistant to Shot-hole fungus, the worst cherry disease of this section. MONTMORENCY This variety ripens about a week later than the Early Richmond and the quality is considered somewhat better than the Richmond. It is a good annual bearer and a strong disease resisting tree. ENGLISH MORELLO The English Morello is a late ripening variety, stands our climate well but is more susceptible to funguous disease than the Early Rich- </seg>
            <seg id="p089">76 mond or Montmorency. It does not live bo well In the eastern part of the state where the wet season sometimes favor the development of shot-hole fungus. It is a favorite in the central and western Ne - braska. The fruit is large and very dark red. PLUMS WYANT This variety is a native type and is perfectly hardy in Nebraska. The fruit is a large purple red plum with free stone. Heavy annual bearer. WOLF Vigorous grower, entirely hardy and an abundant bearer. Fruit is large, dark red, good quality and extra fine for cooking and canning. AMERICA This is a newer sort being originated by Luther Burbank and has a mixture of the American and Japanese blood. While it has not been so well tested out as the above mentioned varieties it is proving to be a favorite of those having it in bearing in the Eastern part of the state. It is a large coral-red p. vim with mild flavor and Very resistant to insect and disease attack. BUR WOOD This is a valuable new plum originated by the late Theodc Hams, of Benson, Nebraska. It is supposed to be a cross betw Burbank and Brittlewood. Flavor excellent; meat solid and pi The last two named plums correspond closest in quality to the Japanese varieties grown in favored sections of the state, but the trees are hardier and promise to be well adapted to a much greater part of the state than the Japanese sorts. PEACH The peach in Nebraska, except in the extreme southeastern corner is rather uncertain as severe winters often kill the fruit and buds and occasionally freeze the trees back almost to the ground. However, every home orchard should have at least a half a dozen peach trees as they require very little attention and when they do escape winter injury and a crop of fruit is produced it is very much appreciated. CHAMPION This is a good early home variety. Fruit is large, juicy and of good flavor. Free stone. Ripens in August. WRIGHT It is a variety originated in Nebraska-small to medium in siie, fair quality and ripens in September. The tree is one ot the hardiest and sometimes withstands severe: winters that injures some of the more choice varieties. </seg>

WORDEN Seedling of the old standard Concord, somewhat sweeter and nsidered by many to be a better table grape. It is considered as hardy as the Concord. CONCORD This variety is so well known that it hardly needs to be described. It is the standard black market grape of the country and is well adapt - ed to Nebfraska conditions. NIAGRA A white or green grape of fair size and good quality; suitable for table use and for jellies and preserves. In the southeastern one-third of the state grapes will withstand the inter without protection. Further West and North they should have some winter protection such as a covering of corn stalks, cane or other coarse material, unless they are planted in a naturally protected :ibli- location. RASPBERRIES CUMBERLAND This is considered the best black raspberry for Nebraska condi - both for home and market. It is a strong, thrifty plant and a prolific bearer. ST. REGIS This is a new variety and is called an "Everbearer." It blooms and bears fruit on new growth coming uot from one year during the early part of the season and again blooms and bears fruit on the wood of that season's growth during late summer and fall, so that it really bears two crops of fruit in a single season. If the canes are frozen back to the ground so that the early season's crop is not produced, the late season's crop will usually come on just the same. It promises be a valuable addition to the home fruit garden BLACKBERRIES While there are several good varieties of blackberries for the horns garden, the Snyder is considered the hardiest and most reliable. Blackberries should be planted on low rich soil and where protec - tion is afforded against the prevailing summer winds. CURRANTS AND GOOSEBERRIES These should be in every home planting. They may be planted to advantage between the orchard trees where they will receive par - tial shade. The varieties that will do well in the most parts of the state are the North Star, a good red currant, White Grape Currant, a favorite for jellies. Downing Gooseberry, producing large fruit and </seg>
            <seg id="p092">78 one of the most popular for home and market, Houghton, a very hardy variety, having smaller berries hut a regular and prolific bearer. STRAWBERRIES Since the development of the "Everbearers," the writer sees little use in planting the old June bearing sorts in the home garden. There are several varieties of the Everbearer that seems to be equal to the old sorts in hardiness, quality of fruit and have the added virtue of bearing throughout the season if the weather is favorable so that fresh fruit may be had during the season with plenty of moisture at any time from May until November. During the dry and drouthy summers these varieties will lay off bearing for a while but usually start in again with renewed vigor as soon as the fall rains and cooler weather set in. We should plant only the Everbearers in our garden. l&gt;i«i u» i The President: We have about fourteen minutes before noon, and I think it would be best to carry Mr. Spencer's paper over until after - noon, and discuss this paper. I would like to say that this papt r if we feature it and carry it out in our Horticultural Journal i.-= published by the other papers, it is going to do us a lot of many people do not know what to plant, and Mr. Marshall to take this paper and give in detail something that woul home planter in different parts of the state. Mr. Williams: 1 would like to enter a protest against too much importance benig placed upon the Everbearing Strawberries. 1 think it is a mistake to neglect those other varieties, and depend upon the Everbearers. I have nothing to say against the Everbearers, but I do not think we should have to depend altogether on them. I believe the Senator Dunlap is a leader, and should be recommended for gen - eral use throughout the entire state. The Everbearers will come al - right during the latter part of the season, if the season is favorable. We should not let them stand alone though, and the Senator Dunlap and the Bederwoods would be two varieties that I would favor be - ing added to the list of strawberries. Mr. Barnard: I would like to second the motion as far as the Senator Dunlap is concerned, but the Bederwood is no good. The Dunlap will hold it's color, and the Bederwood will fade out until there is nothing to it. Everybody that knows anything, knows if you sell Bederwood once to a lady you will not sell her any kind at all after that. But the Senator Dunlap will grow anywhere, and everywhere and stand more abuse than any strawberry that I know of. Mr. Christy: Instead of the Old Crescent. Mr. Barnard: No, the Crescent will not stand the dry weather that the Senator Dunlap will. And you will get more little buttons off from that Crescent than you will off from the Dunlap. Someone has recommended the Kieffer pear, but I never saw anyone yet who </seg>
            <seg id="p093">79 knew how to handle it. la my plantation I do not regard either the Kieffer or the Duchess as a good pear (or canning purposes. I think that the Bartlett and the Lincoln have them all beat. The Lincoln has them all beaten all the way along the line. A few years ago through an accident Mr. George Marshall went over to Illinois to in- gate the Suddith Pear, and I went along with him. When we own where it was being boosted and boomed, we found that there was nothing to it but a boom. While we were there we ran across an - other pear, called the Lincoln Pear. In that neighborhood it was recommended so highly that we brought twenty-five trees apiece home xperimental purposes. Those trees were stanadrd. As proved to me that the standard trees are just as good. xpenen ke a good deal better tree, we took those, Those trees since they have come into bearing, they have produced a full crop every year. We have never had a leaf blight on the tree so far, but that does not prove anything, we may get that next year. Now I under- stand that the Lincoln pear is not on the market very generally, but ■ason why it should not be. because in all locality and n Nebraska I do not know of a single failure of Lincoln er they have been planted, and they are better than n quality and size. Mr. C. G. Marshall: J just wanted to say this, that it is pretty stand, with possibly his permission for the addition of the Dunlap Strawberry. It is only a good berry for home use, understand, but it will grow everywhere in the State of Nebraska. It will grow out in the Sand Hills or in southeastern Nebraska or the northeastern part, and if this list is for home use, the home grower or a person planting on his home, he is not usually a very good hand to culti- vate the strawberries. They get the care that comes to them, just when he has nothing else to do, and the average farmer has plenty to do. SiarU to select varieties for a whole state or a half a state, and while [ knew of the qualiies of some other fruits. I did not mention in the southeastern corner of the State, I was afraid to recommend them for the whole of eastern Nebraska, because they had not been tried out well enough yet to make a recommendation that broad covering so large a territory, and of course that is true, with several of the fruits that should be included in the home orchard and fruit garden. There Diay be pome varieties that have been left out, that should be included both for Western and eastern Nebraska, and I am glad to have those brought out by the other members, and if I have included some that are not adapted to certain parts of the state, or that are better, or if there are others that are better, I would like to have the members sub- stitute in their own opinions what should be used. Mr. Smith: If it is intended that Mr. Marshall's list, which is a most excellent one in my opinion, is to be published, there is no one of us here that could get up a list that would meet the approval of every grower here, and therefore I believe that Mr. Marshall's list should </seg>
            <seg id="p094">80 E therefore the strawberry gets very little attention; and with Marshall's permission, if the list is to go out, I hope the Senator lap should be added. kMr. C. G. Marshall: I think the best way to do is just to publish list as I gave it, with all the discussion following it, and I think would be the best way, to let the people read it, and form their ion. The President: Of course these papers that are read before the Society are usually critised quite carefully because th"e Society must stand behind this report, and we are making the recommendations, that we want the people of the State to get the benefit of, and they can come to the Society any time and get the information they want. tMr. G. A. Marshall: Going buck to strawberries, 1 think we have •rimented now about six summers, and our experience has been they are about as sure to bear in the spring as any spring variety, any other thing, and you take a Progressive and I will get hungrier that quicker than any other berry we have out on the place, and it longer. The Early is a strawberry that pets old awful quick. In ordinary damp season, the Early Strawberry will get more berries i the June berry. Mr. Smith: I move we adjourn.

Spencer, of Randolph, Iowa Mr. Spencer: As a sort of a prelude to the few remarks that I xpect to make on the subject assigned me by the Secretary I want to emonstrate or show by this chart the method of planting. This nieth - 1 is not in general use, although twenty-three years ago, I planted n orchard, and I do not know of anybody else that had an idea of that nd, but I figured it out, and it suited me, about that time there as a statement came from J. H. Hall, from Conneticut, called the 'each King of the United States, and he said, this was the only correct stem of planting apple trees, but he said he was yet to find a man ho had the nerve when the time came, to cut the filler. This sys - m of planting is to utilize the places that are out practically value- </seg>

            <seg id="p096">INTER-CROPS; OR MAKING THE ORCHARD PAY 81 less, while the trees are growing. Some varieties whose habits are such that they must be cut out sooner or later when they begin to get in close proximity to the permanent trees, and when they have began to cut out the premanent tree, then the filler is going to be cut out. Now tliis plat is made by the boys of the State College of Iowa, and I have not varitied their figures, but when I see that is where it came from, it does not need any verification. These trees represent rows thirty-two feet and two inches and a quarter apart one way, and eighteen feet the other. Now these fillers, instead of being a detriment to the tree in the early growth of the orchard, I think are of an actual benefit. They are a sort of a help to the other trees, and those trees should be thirty-six feet apart, and the filler I think should be selected from some variety which has a propensity to bear young, and of good commercial value, and then when you cut them out you have your permanent orchard. The fillers are 77.2 trees per acre. This is the way the orchard looks as it is first planted (indicating) the trees are thirty-six feet apart. Those you get 33.6 per acre, and set in this system (indicating) you get 38.6 per acre. These trees are no nearer together than they would be if they were set in blocks. That is the advantage of this hexagonal method of planting. Now you have the rchard, and this space thirty-two feet, and a fraction apart. Of course .ith the intercroping, as to what we should plant in there, I think It without saying that thorough cultivation is one of the necessities uf taking care of an orchard, and what we should plant there, would depend on what anyone cares to plant. You can put four rows of raspberries or blackberries in between those rows, without crowding the apple trees, or without detriment to the trees. Or strawberries, or potatoes or any truck crop you could also get in there. Or if one Is ituated too far from the market to take up that line of planting, you ould plant corn. Those spaces will accommodate six rows of corn ery comfortably. One can plant six rows of corn one year, and If he choose he can get four rows crosswise the next year. As the trees get larger he would have to narrow it down, and when the trees come up where they shade the corn, it would not do much good to plant corn there. After the trees get four or five years old, I do not think that the practice of trying to raise anything in the orchard would be good. A forty acre orchard planted on that plan will give a man 28 acres of actual ground for corn, and it will grow just as well as It would on any other twenty-eight acres, if it was taken care of, and after the season for raising crops, then of course it should be sown in clover in some crop of that kind, I use clover. I had about eight acres of the first forty planted, that was planted with a filler, that had shown no disposition to bear. And I had here some suggestion along the line of girdling to make them bear. And the next year I girdled these trees, and off from those eight acres, I got $1400.00 worth of apples that year. They had cost me just that, and that Is why I advocated a filler. I think you can make a tree bear young by </seg>

You can see where the growing is done, and it does not hurt the trees. Discussion Mr. Williams: How is that girdling done? Mr. Spencer: I took a spiral saw, and cut a grouve right around the body of the tree, in forty-eight hours the exudation would fill that cut. Of course the theory is, that the tree that has devoted all it's energy to growth of wood, would not bear fruit, and anything will act as a shock to stop the bearing of wood, will make it throw This was done during the most rapid of growth, during the first d June when the tree was in it's fullest vigor. LMr. G. A. Marshall: How long would those fillers stay ore they would have to be cut out? Mr. Spencer: In my opinion you take an orchard l distance apart, and a filler with the habits of growth ol speak of, the Waguer as far as my observation goes, I am impressed with the value of the Wagner as a filler. It has growth, and that filler can stand there from ten to fourteei if you did not get any apples off from them by that time be cut down. I planted some two y&gt; ar old trees, some tw last spring, and used seven hundr the Wagner is about as desirable plat. d Wagners as fillers. \ a. filler as one wants to Mr. Smith: Would you ir permanent trees? ind i y Mr. Spencer: As I have frequently stated, and I w if I was planting an orchard for commercial purposes, I would plant but one variety. It is a great mistake, this going over an orchard with twenty-five or thiry varieties. The commercial man does not want that done when he goes into an orchard to buy fruit, for he would iu rather buy just one variety. I planted this orchard with six hundred Jonathans, and three hundred Grimes Golden, two hundred Delicious and two hundred York Imperial. The Jonathan and Grimes Golden are practically at the same time in picking, and I have no Jonathans in my first orchard, and of course I am a Grimes Golden crank, and those who know me best ,know that, and so I had to plant some of them. But I planted mostly Jonathans because I wanted them. The Stamen Winesap is the most vigorous tree I ever planted. You know that the apple itself Is a very valuable apple, and I know it is going to be a coming tree in our section of the country. Mr. George Marshall: You never tried the Kind David as filler, and don't know anything about it, do you? </seg>
            <seg id="p098">83 Mr. Spencer: I have not used it as a filler, I know nothing about its labits and what it will do. Mr. George Marshall: What do you think of the Missouri Pippin as a filler? Mr. Spencer: Now you are coming into my own stamping ground. In my first orchard I planted six hundred Missouri Pippins as a filler, but they kept blightnig, until you could not make any more shape to a Pippin tree than anything. I am cutting out over one hundred Pippin trees that remain in my permanent orchard, and I would not have them on the place. Mr. George Marshall: Because they blight so? Mr. Spencer: Well, I do not like the apple, it is not a real good selling apple, it is a back number, the same as the Ben Davis. It Is ft little better apple than the Ben Davis, but it won't sell much more an the Ben Davis Mr. Williams: Have you tried the peach as a filler Mr. Spencer: No, I never did. Mr. Marshall: Are you aware of the fact that the Missouri Pippins brought the same price as the Winesap did this year? Mr. Spencer: That is in Nebraska? Mr. Marshall: No, it is in Chicago, because they come from hicago to Nebraska for their good apples. Mr. Spencer: Well, I do not know anything about that. Mr. Marshall: What about the winesap apple? Mr. Spencer: It takes too much time to keep a tree in good order, and you are at them every day, and on Sunday too. I had a plat of ten acres of winesaps one time, that were chucked full, and they brought me over $300.00 an acre that year, but that was the only good crop I ever raised. I raised more or less every year, but I think that the Stamen apple has all of it's good qualities and lacks many of its undesirable qualities. Tou know how much work it is to keep a winesap tree in trim. Tou must prune it all the time. I know that we raised some winesaps one year, and then made a mistake and raised some pretty good ones. Mr. Marshall: What is you favorite apple. Mr. Spencer: Up at Mondamun, where we held our southwestern meeting this year, we were up there in the den of the Jonathans. Of course we all know what the Jonathan is, but my favorite apple is the Grimes apple. But of course the season is short for picking. I never had any trouble about selling good Grimes Apples in my life, and never a bit of trouble selling Jonathans until last year when the Hazel Blush bore Jonathans, why everybody had them to sell. Mr. Marshall: What objection have you to the Ben Davis. Mr. Spencer: It is exceedingly susceptible to canker. In my orig - inal orchard I had eight hundred Ben Davis trees, and I have gotten a good many good apples, off from them, but the blister canker Is go - ing to take them sooner or later. Some orchards have been freed from </seg>
            <seg id="p099">84 It, but most orchards are going because of it. My Grimes Golden is right along side of it, and is free from it. It will always sell, but it will not "bring much money. In the markets in Chicago today Ben Davis is quoted as |3.25 and $3.50 while the Jonathans and Grimes Golden are quoted as $5.50 to $6.00 so it cost just as much to pick it, and just as much to pack it, and your yielding qualities are similar. Mr. Marshall: How about the yielding qualities. I have had some of them bear fourteen bushels to a tree, where I can not get six or seven bushels of the others to a tree? Mr. Spencer: I will answer that question by saying that I planted 2800 trees in an orchard two years ago, and there is not a Ben Davis in it. Mr. Marshall: You would discard your old Winesap for a SUime Winesap? Mr. Spencer: I certainly would. Mr. Marshall: You would discard a certainty for an uncertainty? Mr. Spencer: Yes sir, I would rather have no tree than a Winesap. Mr. C. A. Marshall: If there is any one here who has had exper ence in storing a Stamen, 1 would like to hear how they stand up i storage. I have been told they scald quite badly in cold storage, a most as bad as Black Twig. The President: Is there anyone who has any experience in stor Ing the Stamen Winesap? (No response.) The President: I believe we will have to draw this discussion o this paper to a close, and take up some of the matters that are o the program this afternoon. Mr. Youngers: It does not look right to me, that nobody here has any definite knowledge of what that Stamen Winesap is going to do in storage. If we are going to discard that old Winesap that has made us thousands of dollars in Nebraska for an apple we do not know anything about in keeping qualities. I do not want this Society to go on record as advocating that until we find out something definite. Mr. Spencer: I don't want anybody to plant any Stamen Winesap if they don't want to. But I want to say this. We know this much, that there is nobody that questions the quality of the Stamen Winesap, and I do not believe them if they do, and if they do, I do not know what its quality is. It has all the good qualities of the ordinary Wine - sap, and is practically as big as a Ben Davis. Now those two things are good. Now if you do not experiment and see what it is going to do, you will never know whether It will be better than the other Winesap, and if my life is spared, I think I will prove out on it. Mr. G. A. Marshall: I happen to know where Mr. Spencer lives and where he plants the orchard, and I will tell you he has not had a success with the Winesap that they have had on some of those Hills nearer the river, and over on this side of the river.

For two reasons, first is that he does not like to work very well, and next that he has not had much suc - cess with it, but he really figures, that on his ground the winesap is not very profitable, and of course he is taking a chance with the Stamen Winesap. But what trees I have, I have found that the Stamen Winesap in this State and in Northeastern Kansas, comparing them, with the Winesap if you are going to plant in the hilly country on the west side of the river, down in this apple country, I would stick to the Winesap, whether I planted the Stamen Winesap or not. Of course his paper or his talk is to be printed, and it is his experience, but it is not the recommendation of this Society, but it is, and it is mighty good, and he is not talking through his hat but he is grower of apple trees, and I will stand up for Mr. Spencer, that he is a good grower of apple trees. Mr. Spencer: I want to impose on you just a moment more re - garding the planting temporiarly. Now at any time during the growth, before you cut out the filler, in my case I did not cut out the filler that I expected to. The results are just about the same which ever one you cut out. For instance there was a block of York Imperial, they are just about the poorest excuse for a tree to go that I ever saw. It I do not like them at the expiration,— when the cutting time comes, I will cut them out. Any tree is a filler or a permanent tree just as you choose in an orchard. The President: I think Mr. Spencer, that what Mr. Marshall said in regard to your land there, may also apply to the Missouri Pippen. I have studied orchard conditions on this side of the river thoroughly. On Beaver's land down near Falls City, where the land is low, they blight every year, and on Shubert's they blight too. But I do not think that you can beat them, because they are as large as Ben Davis, and will bear forever it seems, asd they will yield big. and it is a mighty fine apple all around, and you will be ashamed if you take it out. This afternoon we are to take up the ornamental side. The first subject on the program in that division is "Planting Plans for a Fifty-Foot City Lot" By Professor Tel W. Nicolet, of the Department of Hirticulture, University of Nebraska, Lincoln. PLANTING PLAN'S FOB A FIFTY-FOOT CITY LOT By Professor Tel \\ . Nicolet. of the Department of Horticulture, Uni- Mr. Nicolet: The subject of landscape gardening as applied to simply a city lot is what I have to talk about this afternoon. Fifty by one hundred thirty-five feet, that is usually about the slxe of the lots we get within the city limits. If a man wants to spend a lot of money on his ground, I would by all means advise him to buy more land than a fifty foot frontage. If he wants to put a large house on it, there should be room on either side of the house, there should be verslty of Nebraska, Lincoln. </seg>
            <seg id="p102">86 E between his house and the next house, and therefore if a puts up a house that costs asywhere from ten to twenty thousand *s or more, It seems to me that it would be better to put two and dollars less in the house and two thousand dollars more in tnd. However there are a great many people that do not feel as ■y want to put that amount of money In their home, and it is for enefit of those people I want to speak, and tell how to arrange round. If a man wanted to spend twenty-five or thirty or forty rs to put a few shrubs and trees on the city lot, then he would le to get a certain amount of material, which should be arranged e the best effect. However a man that owned a fifty foot lot, if he ;d to spend the amount of money on it, could have golden flowers diamond centers, if he wanted to spend that amount of money, it you see the amount of cost that Is put in on a fifty foot lot de- Eds upon the character of the design. Most people however do not h to put a good deal of money on the five foot lot. They would pre - to just better the appearance of the place as best they can, with a a iall amount of money, but that is to be expected. And then there a great many people who do not propose taking a great deal of erest in it, but are urged on by community to improve their place, that it will improve all the places, and the general appearance of the eet as a whole. For those people also I wish to say a few words, urally, the best arrangement for a house to fit the ground on a which is deeper than it is wide, is the house that has the long e facing the street. Unfortunately, however, on a 50 feet lot i house that you could place in that position, would come to near i lot lines, and you would not be able to get walks past it to the .r door, and it would bring the houses too near together. Therefore E shape of the lot which has been decided upon, and which has been It upon, if it is longer than it is wide, the house should have it's g side going the length of the lot. Now the first step In arranging for trees, and shrubs and flowers or a lot like that would be to take care of that area there in the front. has been considered for a long while in the country that the front ard was the only place that could be beautified, because that it is le part of the lot that is seen from the street. But let me tell you iat the most important part is the back yard. That may seem rather eculiar to you, but if you have the back yard with trees and shrubs round the edge, and a door from living room, that you can go out rom the house right Into the back yard, you will feel that you are n an outside room of the house that has been extended into the ard. The front however should not be neglected, and I would say iat the first thing to do is to beautify this back space, because when ou beautify this, you are beautifying it for your own interests, and hen you beautify the front, you are beautifying it not only for your wn, but for your neighbors interest. Trees in front should be about orty feet apart, with the proper specimens. It is really too bad that </seg>
            <seg id="p103">PLANTING PLANS FOR A FIFTY-FOOT CITY LOT 87 throughout the city, we find trees planted eight, ten, fifteen and twen - ty feet apart, and as they grow up, they just have to fight each other for their very existance, and wherever there is a bit of sky appears down through, then this tree here will send up a branch to that sky In order to get enough light and air and sunshine to live, and there- fore we get crooked trees, that are ungainly in shape. Now the only a fine symetrical tree as a street tree should be, is to way plant them a good distance apart, forty feet, and put in a cheap tree between which should be cut out when they begin to come together. You will want for your fillers a tree which will come very fast, and ong you can cut out the other. Another thing that I would ay is that, that if any community is contemplating the resetting of t's trees, it should have the same type of tree through out. Not a Catalpa here, and then a soft maple, and then some other tree. The street is a straight thing in this country especially, and it is all the same width, throughout, and therefore the unity is produced by having the MM kind of tree placed at equal intervals. That effect of course will be obtained by planting in a filler which will give the effect while the other trees are coming on at a later time. If there are no tree* and if you want to so enframe the house, or if you are so Luated that there are no street trees or otherwise out here (indicat - ■ I perhaps you would want a tree on the lot. I would say to have the parking place, rather than along here, and 1 would keep from the front of the fifty foot lot. If you have too many can not have anything else. hi want trees on the lot line, then I would say plant them gle of one hundred thirty-five degrees from the corner, that irty-flve degrees from the extended line. Plant them so that when the trees grow they would just over-lap the house, just a little bit. It oftens gives a better effect, not to have them planted the tame on either side; this may be twenty or thirty feet here, and maybe fifteen feet on this side, but anyway we will get something like this, (indicating), and then from the street your house will be in a frame. Now there are two kinds of trees, two distinct types that are entirely opposite, and that is the vase formed, and the inverted vase form tree. A particular example of that would be the Honey Locust, al - though it is not as fine as the American Elm. that is a fine example, and you all know how it grows, as you look through two of those trees, you look through the two standards and see the house. Now if we plant a tree like this, and get a tree of that kind (indicating) it would be the Norway Spruce which has an effect something like this, which is an inverted tree. If you wanted to plant some trees to stop that view, you want to plant a tree, that is not only going to stop that view when the leaves are on in the summer, but you want to stop that view in winter, so that you have to plant a tree, or at least thus will get through with it's life in a shorter time. They will give you the effect along the street, and then when the prominent treea </seg>
            <seg id="p104">88 Iie trees in there that will keep their leaves all winter. Now If we . plant a tree like that, and a tree like that at one time here (indi - ting) we are going to get something there that will certainly keep any undesirable unsightly view. In other words this might be rorway Spruce, and this might be an Elm or a Maple, that has it's age high in the air (indicating). Then you want the shrubs at the e corners of the house. It is just the practice of applying every ■ principals to your yard. There is no more difference in land - pe work, than there is in any other lines. It is just using common ry day principals that are used in other arts. Now as you look and see the house, you see it is enframed between these trees, and reen those trees there and you want to get, — I might add here that front door is the space you are going to leave open. In some of the better buildings they have the front door ornament - ed with carvings or have it painted white, while the rest of the house might be red brick. In other words, it is more trimmed so that as you look to the building, it is exceedingly emphasized. Now we can do that with shrubs, in just the same way as we can do it with arclietecture. We can do the same things in the landscape work, as the archetect does in his building. Therefore, what we want to do is to emphasize either side of that entrance. So as to make it appear, as if it is balanced, and you are going in between two sets of shrubs. kit we bad all of our fifty-foot lots, exactly alike, it would get ainly very monotonous, as we went through the city. Everyone different ideas, and that gives variety to the plantings. ;is we view \v 1 of the lots, and as we view all of the lots in one community. How ver in a good many cases a hedge is worked out very nicely around place like that, (indicating), and in the corner, (here), just one or wo specimens of some shrubs Spiryea. or Honeysuckle or Philadelphis, r some other shrub. We want something that will look well with te least amount of work. A good many hedges are effective if just single line of shrubs be planted. If this man plants a single row of lrubs of Anthony Water, or some other type like that, then the ext man should try and plant something else, and if the houses run ose, or if the lots is cut between, do not plant anything. If the lot ne runs from one house to the other, it makes it look larger. Now in egard to bringing in a road for a garage, I don't know whether it orks out as practical to bring it into a fifty-foot lot. If you do ant a garage, then I would pick out a corner lot. If however, you o not want a garage, and you want your back yard as beautiful as possible, I would say that it might be well in the most simple form, to ust plant your trees and shrubs around In a border like that, and in mong the shrubs, plant some trees, like some of the Prunises or yrisis or Protegas, or some of the trees like that, and that will give ou a variety in the planting, which you cannot obtain by just mere hrubs. In the back yard also you will want some shade, especially the house faces North and a good place would be in there, or prob- </seg>

Of course with most things we won't need to bother about them, but probably there are some that you will. Now the sun here you see will give the shadows down on the lawn in the summertime, and it is often very cool and refreshing to be able to sit out there. Now suppose a man with a fifty-foot lot wanted to spend a little more and wanted to have a flower garden in the yard or a vegetable garden. If his house were designed right, he could have it directly back of his house, and have the garden surrounded by a hedge of shrubs. There are so many things that you can do with a city lot, that I hesitate to into all of them. My suggestion here can only be general, because ry particular has to be attended to itself. There can be no suit of clothes made in which every man can dress himself, because some men are tall and some are short. You cannot have any stock pattern for !&gt;&gt;' work, because each fifty-foot lot is a problem in itself. All hove different kinds of houses on them, and probably differ- ent sizes, so that each man has to work out his problem for himself according to what he has and what he wants, and these suggestions however are general, and I hope there will be more planting done in this city, because there is nothing that improves a city more than the people of the city improving their condition and their land, so that the city as a whole will be generally improved. People grow very enthusiastic in the cities over parks and big pro - jects that cost money, but they should start right on the small city lot, and from there the interest is aroused which carries through parks for the people that live in places where they do not have any yard at all. 1 would be very glad to answer any questions that you may ask. I will try to answer them. Discussion Mr. Williams: I would like to suggest to the Professor that hia plans are excellent, where the lots stand out by themselves, but he seems he has not taken into account the fact that your neighbor has a fifty-foot lot right up against yours. In regard to your front trees, forty feet apart, you are going to get next to your neighbors too close. You must adapt your trees in front to your neighbor. Professor Nicolet: In most cities, the individual has nothing to do with the street trees, that is done by the city official who plants and takes care of the street trees, and the individual has no right to come out beyond the street line or to touch a tree. But it seems to me that inasmuch as there is no street forester here, that these men could co-operate, and they should get together and plant trees M they should be, I think it would be a great thing for Lincoln to have a man plant these street trees, and name the kinds that will give a </seg>
            <seg id="p107">90 certain consistency throughout. I think that is needed more than anything else to give Lincoln "The City Beautiful." Mr. Williams: We passed a resolution before this Society last met here, recommending that the city have absolute ownership and control of all trees on the street. I want to get this matter before the legislature, at this time, and it will be necessary to introduce a bill to this effect, and I expect to get our Legislative Reference Bureau to prepare a Bill for that purpose. If we carry out this planting forty feet apart on the street, we are going to spoil that peculiar bal which we have suggested there of two trees coming right directly in front of the house. Professor Nicolet: You could plant one at each corner of the lot fifty feet apart Mr. Jenkins: In handling your trees that way, wouldn't it man) times throw your tree which is a filler right in front of your fr Professor Nicolet: Yes sir, i* would. But you could I in front, for that matter Mr. Chapin: Just for a minute I would like tc back yard planting. Let each individual think of his own back yard, and the source of a view he does not want of his neighbor's back yard, and the planting to hide the prominent views so th not have these disagreeable views of his neighbor's back yard, that he does not want. Often the ba&lt; k yard is entir i ly buildings on the surrounding lots, that must of necessity other end of the lot be very prominent, and now Just show Professor how that can be hidden. Professor Nicolet: Well suppose that the back yard went b that way, (indicating) this should be taken care of, and I w suggest this manner of planting a tree right here. P indicates the rest of his suggestions so that it was impossible for the reporter to reproduce them in a sensible manner. Mr. Chapin: In Lincoln we have fifty foot lots to the block. If every property owner of the twelve, using the same kind of material, and same kind of shrub for his back yard would bear in mind the out - look that he will have of his own back to hide his neighbor's un - sightly shrubs, which each neighbor must have of necessity, that monot - ony of planting would be removed, for there would not be anything planted, but just the samething, and everything would be agreeable. That is, the unsitely views that would be hidden, would be different in each back yard. The President: Are there any further questions to ask. (No questions.) The President: The plan of the Program was to make this an ornamental discussion this afternoon. The next paper will be by Father C. S. Harrison Nebraska on "Ornamental Shrubs, Trees and </seg>
            <seg id="p108">ORNAMENTAL SHRUBS, TREES AND VINES 91 Vines Suitable for Planting on a City Lot.' Mr. Harrison was a dele - gate to the Minnesota Horticultural Society, and sent there by our Society, and he is going to give us a brief report before he takes up the discussion of his regular paper: ORNAMENTAL SHKIBS, TREKS \M&gt; VINES SUITABLE FOR A CITY LOT PLANTING ON By Father C.

And they did, and they planted jiiliai d after orchard, and that old tyrant came and killed them out. And then there was old Peter Giddeon who succeeded in getting the seedlings from the Wealthy apple and finally they began on Iron Clads, and they defied the old terrible winter of the northwest, and now you go to their annual meeting, and you will find just about as as you will any place in the world. One of the old ter member, fell dead while he was cultivating his flowers. ii :it tainly a glorious way to die. They have about eight men who are members of that Society, who are over eighty-four years ey have demonstrated this, that by prop grafting the tender on Iron Clads. they make the fruit hardy itself. For instance, I saw Grimes Golden, which is not a very hardy tree, which had been grafted onto the Hybernal, one of the hardiest of the Russians, and they were monstrous big apples, and the trees were hardy. This process has been developed so that one man had a big orchard up in Northern Wisconsin and they were prop grafted onto the V Ch I suppose that was the most fruitful orchard that the sun ( e\er shown on. Why the ground was completely covered, and the man who bought it of the proprietor or the original vender, be could by prop grafting the tender varieties onto the more hardy trees, move the apple three hundred miles north. One man took the precaution to graft a lot of those onto the Hybernal, and every scion lived, an they boiv a monster crop, and there is a demonstration of it, and you see what they have been. There was a fine tribute paid to the notable ones there, and I never saw much a splendid line of men in my life. Just think of thirty nine hundred members of a Society, and the whole hall packed to the utmost. I went up into that country in 1857 my - self, and I know what it is, and no more thought of raising apples in those days, than I did oranges, and there now are those marvelous successes. Now then, as to the subject which has been assigned me, I will attempt to make a few remarks upon that. </seg>
            <seg id="p109">92 TREES, SHRUBS AND FLOWERS FOR A CITY OR VILLAGE LOT. The tendency is to overdue things. We plant too thickly and then haven't the nerve to thin out as our trees and shrubs begin to crowd. As to trees, don't have too many, and these should not be of too rank growing a nature. Your street trees will probably be the Elm or Maple and they will give you enough of that grade especially when they begin to invade your yard. You should have a beautiful well selected Picea Pungus with it's royal robes of silver and saphire, and a radiant concalor. The finest of all the evergreens is perhaps the Silver Cedar with its delicate frost - ings and shimmering in the sun light. For trees I would have one Japan tree lilac, and one Chinese tree lilac. This is a wonderful tree of recent introduction, a June bloomer, flooded with a glorious blanket of snowy white and honey-scented flowers. I cannot speak too highly of this tree. Coming down to shrubs, the Van Houtti takes the lead, and will hold it. Coynti is the earliest bloomer, coming on with the tulips; if you have room put in a Caronarins Syringa. Then a Columbiana, then Grandeflora, then Gordons late and last the French Mammoth. If you could get a Rocky Mountain Rubus Dilicious with its large snowy white blooms, it would add much in the way of investment. You should have the summer blooming lilacs, one Yalissa, and one Rutshneider, sure and beautiful bloomers COLORED FXJLIAGE For flowers, you will need the four great perennials. The Peon Iris, Oriental Popy and Columbnies. The Iris is the coming favorit "Oh beautiful, beautiful flower. The ward of the sunshine and shower In garments of woven delight, Of sunset, aurora and light." I emphasize this flower, because for twenty years I have studied and published two editions of the Iris Manual. It takes a great deal to break down prejudice. Though there are 170 native sorts and thousand of fine Hybrids, yet people sneer at the name. "Nothing but flags that grow in the swamps" is what they say; when most of them could not live a week, with feet wet. Twenty years ago the objection was raised against the Peony, "Nothing but that coarse 111 smelling thing our grandmothers raised." Look at a field of modern peonies. When they wave with their flowers, they weave a carpet of delight fit for the touch of angels' feet. By proper planting of the Iris, you have a succession of blooms for over two months. First we have little Pumilia, then its Hybrids. Then the early and medium and late Intermdelias. Then early and </seg>
            <seg id="p110">93 late Germans culminating with the royal Delmetica and Sheffield Giant. So for two months the housewife can cut a bouquet of Peonies, fresh with the morning dew for her table. 1 have seen an Iris garden of acres iS full bloom. The air hover - ing over laden with fragrance. It was like a sea of glory. The newer ones defy description. These are the Immense Macrantha, Monsignor, and Orraflame, with petals as big as a lady's hand. Then there is the Parvar, a cunning little pickanniny. A cute little nigger, a baby of a flower, which looks up smiling in your face, one of the most unique flowers that blooms. I have raised thousand* of Peonies, Pholexs and rare Parennials from seeds originating some fine ones, but am now giving the remainder of my life to the Iris. There is no flower so easily improved from seeds and it is one of the inating delights of flora culture to produce new variety NATIONAL FLOWERS. There has been many a scrap among landscape artists as to her flowers should be raised in the front yard or not. Brookline. a suburb of Boston, is supposed to have more millionaires to the acre than any town in America. One day while visiting a friend there, we were sitting on his porch, and I said, "You seem to own about a dozen very fine flower gardens," as we had a splendid view of that many, ■om where we were sitting. "Yes," said he, "We have planted «o ich can have the benefit of the grounds of others and the effect w«s fine. One man would endeavor to have what others had not, and to each covered the whole, and as laboring people strolled along, weary from their day's work, they rested themselves with a splendid view. They owned them with their eyes. I thought this altruism was some - thing delightful, in planting your own enjoyments, to plan also for the delight for others. Many a man of means never gets acquainted with his wife and daughters. I know a man of wealth, who insists that his great yard should be an unbroken piece of green grass and dandelions. The ladies wanted flowers. A florist took over a splendid lot of Iris, unique in beauty and had them put in a vase. Now said he, "Fill another big vase with big weeds, dandelion and green grass, and set them side by side, and asked the father which he likes best for an ornament." You only have to use your imagination to arrive at his answer. Now if a patch of green, a mixture of a doxen sorts of grass and weeds, is more beautiful than the most gorgous flowers the sun shines on, then raise your mongrals, of course. Otherwise put beautiful flowers in their place, which will unfold their beauty from the early spring until the hard frosts of autumn. If you have your flowers in front, the passerby can enjoy them. The tired wife can sit on her porch and visit with the best dressed and best behaved company on earth, and her friends can sit with her. On the other hand if she is </seg>
            <seg id="p111">94 ashamed of her flowers, she can keep them in her back yard with the pigs and chickens. The President: I wish that some of us younger members of the Society could kind of take over Mr. Harrison's pep and enthusiasm on some of these subjects. Mr. Stewart of Omaha, I do not see him here, but we have his paper here on "Hardy Perennials," by Mr. S. B. Stewart, of Omaha, Nebraska, and I will ask the Secretary to read his paper in his absence.

Mr. Stewart not being present, the Secretary will read his paper, which he has mailed to us. (The Secretary reads the paper). HAKDV l'EKE.WI.YLS, THKIK USE VXD CULTURI Hardy Perennials or Old Fashioned Garden Flowers, as they are sometimes called, are coming rapidly to the front ranks among the home folks and flower lovers. And this is not hard to understand and when we consider that we have a plant for every condition. If a plant is wanted for a hot, dry place or wet and shady, or under a tree, on the north side of the house or bordering a drive or walk, or planted among shrubbery in a rockery, in fact a plant that will meet up with any condition, by a judicious selection one may have a splendid display of flowers from April until the last of November. Starting with Pyrethruma and Columbian Violets and others and finishing the season with Chrysanthemum and Asteroids. A hardy garden play of beauty, and one may well be proud of possessing In preparing a hardy garden, one must bear i planting is permanent and he must prepare the ground accordingly. Have it well fertilized and deeply dug. The better you prepare the soil, the better will be your results. It makes no difference whether the planting is done in the spring or fall, we have perfect success in planting in both seasons. Some of the best varieties for the beginner to start with are the Coreopsis, Delphinium, Gallardia, Pyrethrum, Phlox, Iris, Gypsophlia, Platycodian and plants of their nature. They are rugged hardy growers, and by having the soil well prepared they will require very little attention, except to keep free from weeds and well cultivated. Most perennials love the sun, but many varieties will stand partial shade. Some of the finest Delphiniums that it has been my privilege to .see grow , were grown in about one-half shade, and they were splendid, standing about four feet high and a mass of beautiful bloom.

A splendid plant for many conditions. If one wants a plant for a shady nook on the north side of the houee where it is hard to get anything to grow. Spade it up good and deep and plant Iris. The flowers may not be quite as heavy and waxy as those grown in the full sunlight but they are perfectly satisfactory. and require no special care. One of the most striking beds that can be planted on the lawn is the Delphinium bordered with the Coreopsis. Draw on your imagina - tion, a bed of beautiful sky blue Delphinium bordered with the grace - ful, golden flower of the ever-blooming Coreopsis. And they like many ler Perennials require very little attention, except to keep the old wers and pods removed. A good border for the drive to the garage ong the walk can always be made with the Phlox and Iris. The is small, and when once planted they will last a life-time. Cultl - freely, and they will repay you manifold. The propagating of the Perennials is done in two days by seed or •avai;e. Much of the seed is hard to grow, and it would be best for the amatuer to procure small plants, which are Inexpensive. By cleavage is meant to lift the large plant and divide it. This is a good way to increase any special variety you may want. Hardy Perennials ire not used as extensively as they should be. I thank yon 8. B. STEWART. The President: We have now heard this paper of Mr. Stewart's nd there are a few moments for discussion. If anyone cares to open the discussion, Mr. Stewart not being here to answer any questions, we might discuss it. No discussion) FALL BULBS. By R. F. Wierick. The President: We have a letter here from Mr. M. J. Wragg, of Des Moines, Iowa, the next speaker, stating it is impossible for him to come, but that Mr. Ray Floyd Wierick, will be on hand. If Mr. Wieric-k is here we would like to hear from him. Mr. Wierick: In such a matter, as the subject of fall bulbs, dif - ferent people look at these things in different ways.. As a landscape designer, I have my own peculiar notions as to how these things should be handled. Personally I do not like the idea of putting bulbs out in geometrical beds, or along side of the house, and as both of those styles are artificial and do not look a bit natural. It looks more natural to scatter them along the edges of the </seg>
            <seg id="p113">96 Perennial beds. It looks an though they grew natural there, and it is better than to have them out in moons or stars or artificial beds like that. Let them grow out on some hillside, let them grow up natural - ly, and in time you will have one of the prettiest things that you ever saw in your life. Supposing one were planting some Snow Drops. I very often take a handful and throw it over my shoulder, backwards, and where each Snow Drop falls, take a trowl and plant it, and they fall in a sort of a natural way. Now as Professor Nicolet said there is no suit of clothes made that fits all people, and outside of those two suggestions and the idea of not mixing the color too much, it is a good idea to stay pretty close to one variety, and if you must mix the colors, you had better leave out any unharmonious plantings, or mixing of colors. I prefer personally to use Tulips alone and Snow Drops alone, and Jonquils and Narcissus alone. If a problem of design comes into my office, I treat it just the same as a lawyer would treat an individ- ual case, and go to the files, and books and make a design that would fit that subject. Each problem is treated by itself. We are goins through this in Iowa, possibly a little further ahead than in Nebraska, and we are through the Pioneer stage in this work. I never use the ex - pression ' The City Beautiful" because it carries the wrong name to the client. But if a man or woman be dressed up in clothes that fit them, and clean clothes and look as though they were groomed with a little taste, and as though they wanted to look their best, that is not beautifying but is using good sense. That is about the same way with a lawn, and if the trees are planted out the way th*y should b*\ that is just common sense, and like wearing a collar when you go to work, and it does not show any effeminate nature at all. And when you talk about a planting to be carried out. you want to make it beau - tiful, so that it would be so to a man looking at it from an areoplane. My grandfather came out from Pennsylvania, and down the Ohio in a boat, and up the Mississippi, and in a prairie schooner, out to Wes - tern Iowa, and settled down, and he was a pioneer, and when my father married my mother, and she liked rocking chairs he thought that was going too far, for he was of the old school, and if he knew now that I was a landscape designer, he would probably turn over in his grave. He said that in his time that every snow storm was a blizzard, and that you could not be out in any snow storm with any de - gree of safety or comfort, but now it is not so, because our forefathers saw the benefit of putting in trees. I have a man in my town who says that when trees were first planted in his county, he could go to any tree in the County, and take hold of the top of it, and bend it over with his hand. I do not agree absolutely with people who say we have grown all the ornamentals which we can grow, which I do not believe is so. In Iowa and this territory, there are a great many things which does not seem as though they can be handled now. I know of some Magnolias in Des Moines that are as tall as this building, and also some beeches. I know of one or two Yew trees in Iowa, and </seg>
            <seg id="p114">i </seg>
            <seg id="p115">97 I know of lots of people who will tell you that it is absolutely Im - possible to grow a Yew tree in Iowa. In the past year and this year, for the government, I have had some twenty or twenty one pieces of work to carry out on the ground. If you have a shrubbery bed to put in on a government lot, they never think of letting you turn It over with a spade, and plant them right then and there. You mutt take and dig out your bed two and one half feet deep, and every partical of dirt in that place that is not black, that must be taken out. and bring back black dirt, and on top of that put In four inches of old manure, and spread it out, and when that has been raked down, then you put on forty-four inches for the mulch. Now at the first of June stuff in Missouri, that we never expected to come through came up, and we had to take strings and tie it up from going all over the side walks. It is just a matter of good preparation, and then you will get all the good results you want. Over in our State we have a hard time in convincing them that it is a matter of preparation and taking care of it afterwards. He seems to know if he plants corn, he must take care of it, but he does not seem to know, that if he puts in an ornamental tree or shrub or a bulb, that he .must take care of it, he thinks that it will take care of itself, and grow under any conditions that may exist. Discussion Mr. Brown: You mentioned planting bulbs on a hill side or a rough ground, or something like that. If you had a hill that was not easy to cultivate, you would plant them right in the rough ground or the sod, would you? Mr. Wierick: I would take the tod away, so that they could get through A member: I want to tell the gentlemen that there is no danger of the bulbs coming through the sod, I have bulbs in my yard, that are planted about four inches deep, that come through every year. Mr. Williams: I move you that Mr. Wierick be elected to an honorary membership in our Society. Seconded and carried. The President: There is one other matter that we want to take up before the Society, before we all get away. It is the matter that Mr. Bassett has suggested in regard to keeping an index of the Horti - cultural records of this Society. I think that we should make Mrs. 8. P. Spencer of Randolph Iowa honorary member. Seconded and car - ried. Mr. Bassett: At this time speaks in regard to his Horticultural History index proposition.

The Society met pursuant to adjournment and the following proceedings were had and done. President: Calls the meeting to order. President: This is supposed to be garden day, and potato day. We have one subject that is not exactly gardening, though strawberries are most always grown in the garden by the average family. Mr. Christy will give us his talk "Everbearing Strawberries" something that has been creating lots of interest in the last few yean, and we will now hear from Mr. George Christy, of Johnson, Nebraska, on "Ev - erbearing Strawberries and their place in the Home Garden." F.VKKBKARI\&lt;; STRAWBEKR1ES AND THEIR PLAGE IN THE HOME GARDEN Mr. Christy: I think it was about five years ago, I was asked to talk, on the everbearing strawberry before this audiance, and then I came before you like a scared rabbit, because I did not dare say very much about the everbearing strawberry. But since gome of the things that have already occured In this Society this year, I am inclined to think most anything would be accepted now as all right, bo it is with quite a different feeling than five years ago, that I come before yon this morning to talk about the everbearing strawberry. If it has been in the mind of the people some how or other that this everbearing strawberry was something supernatural, or quite beyond the poesibil- By Georgp Christy, of Joluiaon Nebraska. </seg>
            <seg id="p130">110 ities, and yet you never stop to think that more than a thousand years ago, even before Christ, that over along the Jura Mountains between France and Switzerland, that the wild man there would lay down his war club once in a while, to pick a handful ot berries for his sweet - heart, and that they existed there ever since and that the idea of the Everbearing strawberry seemed to be kind of wierd, but nevertheless they existed there years and years ago. And then the people wanted to know how to bring that about here, and the crossing of berrie and propagation of plants was started, but unless we study any certain subject, it is strange now how little we know about it. And we do not know just how those things were brought about, but on the other hand if we bring it down to something people understand better, there was a man by the name of McGee a good many years ago that most of you remember something about, that got tired of feeding the Poland hog for a couple of years, before he could be br market, and yet it was almost impossible seventy five years ago to put a hog on the market the same year the pig was born, for it tot one to two years to put that hog on the market. Hut Mr. McGee got the idea into his head to cross that little china pig on the pig, and make a hog come to maturity quicker, and did. Now the little quick growing china hog was crossed Poland hog and we have our Poland-China hog that w the market with at six months old, and sometimes weight two hundred and seventy-five pounds or bettei We do not think about that now. We can als faced animal, with almost any color, and actually brin faced animal, or take the blackest and in a few years tie which are all right, and naturally we would not think anyt about that, and it is just as simple as the case we have with the I bearing Strawberry when you come to think about it a little. 1 brought about this everbearing strawberry, and there is nothing sup« natural or wild or wierd about it, just simply one of the plain laws of nature. This Everbearing Strawberry that has existed there in the mountains for hundreds of years, and our friend Jules Sandon, one of the members of the Society told me, that often in the fall of the year when he went out hunting in the mountain that he knew where those strawberries were, and would go and pick them at his native home in Switzerland. But the berries we had in the United States, none of them ever bore in the fall, and people just kind of got the idea in their heads, that such a thing did not exist, and those plants were finally brought over here and sold in this country, but they are of no value here from the fact they are so subject to rust, and one disease and another that when they are imported into this country they die a male and a female in the vegetable kingdom as well as there is in the animal, and then there is the extension, or as we speak of the new plants starting from a nodule. Now the setting of the seed is just as simple as the crossing in the animal kingdom. And that is just what </seg>
            <seg id="p131">EVERBEARING STRAWBERRIES 111 within a year, and while those plants were sold here, they were joke, and they did not pay any money for them at all, and the berries would not amount to anything if they were bought for the purpose of raising berries. But with McGee in his crossing of the animal kingdom, we had one man that in the vegetable kingdom went to work in the same way to make the cross on the berries, and they suc - ceeded. Thousands upon thousands of plants were grown, and only f them that was of any value for years, and there is where the ry seems to be with people in these crosses. Now our spring berries, we have often crossed and recrossed our Chilian berry. Our native little wild berry crossed on the big berry from Chilli, by doing that, we have got a berry of a very good flavor and good size, but we know there is not a berry today that is equal to the wild berry in flavor. Not one of our garden berries that equals the wild berry in flavor. We have increased the size, but lost the flavor. Now this Horticulturalist went to work crossing the native berries by actual hand pollination of the different types, so that he noticed what he crossed on, and our "ry which seems to be the leading of all the everbearing he progressive, and is a cross between the wild berry that e foothills of the Alps there for thousands of years, and wn Senator Dunlap, and so when you get a progressive mber that the mother plant was a Senator Dunlap, and do ien is anything unnatural or out of the way that they repro - ies all the season through, because they have, you might blood of the everbearing strawberry in them, that has existed t 1 ii i &lt; ■ . and the only trouble we did not know anything about it ad never seen it n that we have the berry, and it is simply due to natural so many people seem to think there was something of t the fellow that grew the everbearing strawberry at first, and there is something unnatural and uncommon about the fair, but there is not a thing to it except the natural pro- Why it has been a long, long time since God said, he put to have dominion over the earth, and I do not think we t how much he said when he said that. There are a lot of n things that we have dominions over that we have not even awakened to, and if we just go ahead with study and our research, we will find out these things We have the Progressive now, and today definitely know about the natural consequences and established facts that have to do with it, and we all know that everybody can grow it, that will give it the time, and attention. But remember this, that it is crossed on a foreign berry, and this foreign berry has not the stamina that our native berry has. and any of the everbearing berries will require more careful at - tention or nursing than our native berries because they stand almost any abuse, and still pull through and make a few berries. Now just to follow down the line of thought, that nature has brought out, we </seg>
            <seg id="p132">112 know that the live plant has to reproduce Itself, and the plant of course has two ways of doing it, either by runners or by the seed. Now if it produces through the seed, then of course it must make the straw - berry and produce strawberries for that purpose. Remember that is the idea of the strawberry, that It is not to produce what the people admire so much, but it is to produce the seed that it does its work, so if we want to produce as many strawberries as possible it is necessary that we prevent this everbearing strawberry from making runners. Now when 1 first received this everbearing plant, I set it out and the first year I think I received fifteen plants of the progressive, and quite a number of other varieties. That year I think I had six or seven dif - ferent varieties, but with the progressive I planted it out and just let it go to making plants. Now I never had a bed of Senator Dunlaps make more than that bed did the first year 1 set it out but in the fifteen plants. I do not think I picked a quart of berries the first year. Then the next year I did not have so many plants, but I had so many berries, I began to get wise as to what the berries would do, and I commenced keeping off the runners. You have to get right to thinking about these ques - tions of what nature really intends shall be done. So it is an easy matter to produce either berries or runners with this everbearing strawberry. Now all we need now is to put out plants, and have moisture and cool atmosphere to make a success of it. The further south we go, the poorer the everbearers do. They do better in Min - nesota and Colorado than here in Nebraska, and so just to get them in the condition they require is where they will do the best, and the further North you go, the better they do. Now after the planting of them it is just about the same as any other berry, and I do not think it is necessary to go into that very extensively, because we all know U',\v to take care of the strawberry bed, But now with the progressives, it fa uecessary through the hot season especially that they have more moisture than we usually get. Usually in the hot part of August they will alnost quit bearing entirely. The berries are small, and the sun gets so hot at that time, and if the bed is not taken proper care of, they v. ill usually blight. I do not know just how long these plants would bear if they had a good chance. One man told me yesterday he had a plant he had picked berries from every month for seventeen months, and I know I have picked them for seven months, just in the open, and even after the ground freezes up, I will find some berries that were protected under leaves that I can pick. I think the 15th of November was the latest I ever picked any. Mrs. Corey, Secretary of the W. C. T. U. told me this morning that she went out one morning upon which she broke some ice in the water in a vessel on her back porch, and then 'vent out and picked some of these everbearing berries underneath the loaves that were still in good shape, and she was surprised they were not frozen or ruined entirely, but they were not, now the progressive which I think is the best of all — of course there is the Supperb, and it </seg>
            <seg id="p133"/>
            <seg id="p134">113 io good, but it lays flat on the ground, and you cannot mulch it or you will have a lot of dirty berries. The Supperb does better the second year than the progressive. The progressive does the best the first year it is ever planted out. The best time to plant strawber - ries, is the early part of April. Of course the further north you go or the further south you ago, you will have to change your conditions of planting. In the northern part of Nebraska, we would not want to plant them on the northside, which is usually the best because the ground might be frozen yet. In Kansas that is just a little too late of course, April, I mean. Now our Secretary planted a bed last year to test out a little where he had plenty of water to irrigate, and two beds were set out of the progressive, and one was allowed to make all the runnings it could, and the other bed, all of the runners were kept off, and on the eighteenth day of last September I was there when we made an examination of these two beds, and one of the plants where the runners had been kept off, and all the blossoms cut off until the first of July, there were on the 18th day of September 145 straw - berries and blossoms on this one plant, and there were also thirteen stalks that had borne berries and ripened berries through a season, and through the season there was another total of probably 65 or more, and that makes over 200 berries this one plant had produced. Now when we came to the plants that had been allowed to run, and make the runners, the very best we could find In any of them waa 7 5 berries that it would produce during the season, so you see what the difference is where they are allowed to produce both plants and berries, or where they are just grown for the berries. OiHcussion Mr. Williams: Was there any difference in the size of the berries in favor of the hill plant. Mr. Christy: Just at this time I could mot say whether or not there was any difference in the size, but I am sure there would be later in the season. Our everbearing strawberry is a little smaller than the Senator Dunlap, but the flavor I find to be just excellent. The berry will turn red when it gets ripe. To get the best berries, let them be on the vine a little while after they are red. I do not think there is a berry in existence, whose flavor is any better than the Progressive. Now there has been recently a berry originated, that they call the fig type, because it just dried up like a fig and you could eat the berry most any time. The Progressive is as near that as any - thing I know, and if you pick it twice a week, you will get all the berries you can find, and of much better flavor if you leave them after they have turned red, until they begin to get real dark. All we must do on any of these things is just follow out the lines that nature intended. If it is berries, you want, keep off the runners, and if it is plants, then keep off the berries. With the strawberry plant it is </seg>
            <seg id="p135">114 following out the law of nature just like with me, because when men center their energies all over the whole sphere of life, they never amount to much, while one fellow without many brains will produce a great deal sometimes when he just centers upon one proposition. You know of the wonderful crop they produced two years ago, and there were very few plants in the country made an average of a quart to the plant that summer, when that was cool and damp. Mrs. Smith: How about your plants when they get two or tlm years old, do they continue to produce as good a berry? Mr. Christy: They do not, not the second year. Never let the progressive bed stand over two years, the first year is when you get your best berries, in that fall. Now if you want berries for the spring. I have never been able to leave a patch larger than a rod square, and even then this last spring, I left a patch about a rod square, and after the berries were ripe orders came to me for the plant, and we took up the whole thing and sent the plants all off. I haven't gone into it for market purposes at all, from the fact that I have thought that they would be most too small to go on the market real good. If people understand them, and found out what they are. They are a bet - ter flavored berry than any berry I know. They are a much better shipper, and will hold up better than the Senator Dunlap, but unless you had a market that would take the berries at a good round price, I do not think it would pay to produce them through the fall sea?on. and the berries for the spring crop. I think that the Dunlap an&lt;! other varieties will sell better on the market than what the P would. Yet if the people really knew the flavor there was in you could pick them nice and ripe, they would sell for me than the Dunlaps would right in the spring. Mr. Marshall said yesterday he would advise plat and no other variety for the spring crop. In the north part of the state I would say that was the thing to do. In the southern part of the state both will be all right. South of the center of Kansas the everbearing strawberry is almost a complete failure. I have the first recommendation to come from the everbearing strawberry south of Oklahoma. That is, I mean on the north line of Oklahoma, south of that line. Everyone I sent them to pronounced them a failure down there. And to every place I sent them North or West, they wera a great success. We must take into consideration the locality and con - ditions and everything. What I would say with reference to the ever - bearing strawberry would not do to adopt south of the Kansas line, and yet north of Nebraska and through the Dakotas and Minnesota, they could adopt a whole lot more, yet it would be the truth. A Member: What is the best method to carry the everbearer through a drouth, provided you cannot irrigate. Mr. Christy: Mulching will do that, and I think mulching will do better than cultivation, through a real serious drouth it should be mulched before it gets real dry. You should however have the </seg>

What about other berries? A The hill culture is good, but I like the hedge row, you get berries to the acre. 3 How close would you plant the hills? A I think 15 inches apart with the everbearer, and a little — is owing to how much land you have, I would put the rows wide nough so that you could cultivate with a horse. If you have Just city lot, then you can cultivate with a hoe. Mr. Williams: My plan is to plant two double rows further apart ch way, and then skip two rows, to cultivate with a wheel hoe, and hen plant two rows more. Mr. Christy: I would put every row wide enough so that I &gt;uld drive between them and cultivate with a horse, if you are out a farm. Of course on a city lot where it is worth a thousand liars a lot ,you cannot afford to waste land enough to work a horse, and then you must put your rows closer. Q How far apart do you recommend that the hedge row be? A I plant my rows four feet apart. But with the ideal condition. here should not be two plants, each plant should have six inches quare in the hill system. Whenever you get your hills closer than hat, the roots run so close together they rob each other. Mr. Smith: We hay have a misunderstanding of the hedge row. I believe it is of interest to all of us here to have you tell us what it is A I usually let my hedge row be a foot to sixteen inches wide. Q Isn't that commonly called a matted row? A Yes sir. Q And then the wide space of three or four feet A Yes sir. Q A hedge row would be what some people call a matted row? A Yes sir, it is a narrow row on which the plants are allowed to A Lady Spectator: What berries, other than the everbearing strawberry would you recommend? A The Senator Dunlaps. Q What else? A The Gaudy is the best I have, and the Bederwood, while it makes lots of berries, they are light colored, and the flavor is very good, but still they do not go very good on the market, and people want the dark berry like a good red apple. It is just the same with the berry as it is with the apple, and while the Bederwood may hare all the quality of any other berry, yet it is a light berry, and for that </seg>

The President: The next number on the program will be by Mr. John Enders upon "Growing Vegetables under glass." Mr. Enders is a practical gardener near Lincoln, and I am sure that what he has to say to us will be of great interest. GROWING VEGETABLES UNDER GLASS By Mr. John Enders r After about twenty-two years of experience in growing, or trying grow vegetables under glass, or what we call a Green House, I feel that I know very little about what is very essential in the work. Our main crop is leaf lettuce, radish and parsley. And then we grow green onions, pie plant, cucumbers, tomatoes and spinach. These are on the side. We also grow many kinds of plants in season. Lettuce be - ing our main crop I will talk on that in particular. After preparing the seed bed, we sow seed either broad cast or in rows. After plants are up three or four inches high, we trans - plant in beds five or six inches apart, which have been prepared for that purpose. And now the trouble begins, it must have close at - tention, and not let it get too dry, and must have plenty of ventila - tion to get the best results. It then takes from five to ten weeks U grow the crop, growing much faster in spring and fall than It does in the winter months during the short days. We have many things to contend with, such as insects and dis - ease, which are sometimes hard to understand. We use tobacco smudge for the bugs. For disease change the soil or use formaldehyde spray. The temperature seems to be best for lettuce and radishes at about 50 to 60. If we get it too warm it will draw right up to the stem with scarcely any leaves. And if it gets too cold it will hug the ground, and make very little growth, so it is important to do it Just about right to be successful. We use about the same soil for radishe. - as we do for lettuce, very highly fertilized. We do not transplant for radishes, we sow in rows in beds about six inches apart. It requires about four weeks for radishes to bulb. We try to get a radish with a small top, as they are inclined to grow too high under glass. Parsley we sow the seed in July or August right in beds where we want it for the winter, and keep picking it as we need it for the market. it is very important that we have a market for our goods en they are ready for they do not keep very long. The onions and pie plant we grow under benches. We use winter onions or good sized spring onion bulbs. Pie plant we take the roots from out of doors. The roots are no good after once used for forcing. Cucumbers we grow during the time that it is not in use for lettuce, that is in summer when out of doors lettuce Is in evidence, and toma - toes about the same way. Although it is posaible to have these all </seg>

I think there are many other vegetables that can be grown under glass, but we have not tried them. Now if anyone is looking (or a good steady job three hundred and sixty-five days in the year, and five or six months night and day, go into the Green House business. It is not so easy as It looks, but then we are not after the easy things, any one can do easy things, we are after the impossible. I thank you. The President: I have noted here of late that In practically every town in the eastern section of the state of three thousand and up, some gardner is starting to grow these vegetables in the winter, under glass, Beatrice, Nebraska City, Auburn, and Palls City, and towns like that, they are fitting up a market, and years ago those things did not exist, and were not done by the use of glass in the winter. People living in town or living in the country for that matter are affording green vege - tables in the winter as well as in the summer, and it bids fair to be - come an industry which will be taken up in any locality where there is a sufficiently large settlement to take the product, so that it is not bject we need to overlook. It belongs to horticulture, and we try glad to have Mr. Enders paper on this industry. The next subject is by Mr. F. D. Fllfton, of University Place, Ne - braska, on Strawberries and Asparagus."

There being M small an amount of the former kind in this vicinity at least, we have to accept the latter. od rich land should be chosen, and not too low, as plants on und are more apt to be affected by late frosts when in blossom, as well as later on when the fruit is set, than upon ground of higher elevation. Ground should be deeply fall-plowed as the roots of the plant penetrate deeply, if the ground is in proper condition for them to do so, consequently prolonging the bearing season at a time when the greatest demands are made for moisture and fertility. One of the most serious obstacles we have to contend with is an occasional season lacking moisture during the ripening season. Hence we must do our part to preserve all the moisture possible by deeply plowing and as heavily mulching as the plants will stand. Rows should be marked four feet apart, plants placed two feet apart in rows, planted in spring as soon as new growth appears, roots should not be spread out, but placed so they will penetrate into the </seg>

Care should be exercised to avoid covering crown of plant. If proper care and attention is given during the season, the new runners will quick - ly take root and make a splendid showing by fall. At least eighteen inches should be cultivated between rows to prevent matting together of rows. This strip serves as a path during the picking season. Blos - soms should be picked off from the plants the first season after plant - ing, if not the strength of- the plant is drawn upon by the berries in - stead of furnishing strength for a stronger plant, thereby sending out more vigorous runners, as well as a greater number. One important point (in my mind at least) is often overlooked, that of mulching. The usual advice is use old hay, straw or corn stalks. The prevailing idea seems to be that the strawberry plant is very tender and should be covered at the approach of winter in order to protect it from "freezing out." After 25 or 30 year's experience, have never known plants to winter kill. Two objects are in view in mulch - ing, first to keep the plant dormant as long as possible in order to escape late frosts which often visit it just when in bloom. Even if no late frost appears the greatest benefit derived is in keeping the fruiting season delayed as much as possible. When our home grown berries ar first placed on the market, we have not only the home grown, but the southern berry to contend with. If we can keep our berries back a few days or a week, we meet with a better demand as well as a bet - ter price. In order to accomplish this object, delay mulching until Jan - uary or February, when the ground Is frozen at it's greatest depth, and then mulch with barnyard manure, with a liberal amount of bed - ding, cover well, do not be afraid of heating and running plants. I recently noticed an article in a K. C. paper copied from an Agricultural paper advising against the use of manure as it was liable to heat and kill the plants. Evidently they had never tried it. All objectional uses of manure, are eleminated by rait the same through the straw into the ground, thereby stimulating the plant to stronger growth. I am frequently asked the question, when shall I remove the covering from my strawberry bed? My reply is leave it alone, otherwise your labor is thrown away. Then in the sec - ond place such mulching as recommended lays closer to the ground and holds moisture much better than hay or straw. The largest berries are grown the second season after planting, but the greatest yields are usually obtained the third year. The life of a strawberry patch can be prolonged a year or two after this with good results by cultivating or plowing out the old row, leaving a strip about eighteen inches in center of rows. This should be done as soon as fruiting season is over. Each season as soon as berries are picked, mow off plants, weeds, etc., rake and burn. </seg>

A No. Q I knew of a field of an acre and a half to be burned out at one time, but I do not know whether or not that was put 01. toe early. Possibly this was put on too early. A I have taken this method and used it for the last ten years and never saw any injury in that regard, but I never mulched until the ground was frozen. Q Do you separate it from over the plants In the spring? LA If put on hurriedly in chunks or lumps, then remove those ps. Q Do you mean to mulch between the rows? A Yes sir. Q How can you cultivate? A After the first season you do cultivate at all for field culture Mr. Williams: I think it is well to add a word of caution in re - gard to this mulching. Mr. Clifton I see is very strong on advocating heavy mulch, but I have had injury from too heavy mulching, and 1 think you should be cautious in the use of manure. I like to use manure of course, and the finer it is the better, and some of it settles right down among the plants on the ground, and makes a heavy pro - tection for the plant in the winter, it is a great fertilizer, but that must not be put on heavily, if I was depending on manure for a fertilizer I would put it on thin, with fine manure, and then add some course stuff. When I use the manure as it usually comes from the stable with a fine and courser mixed, then the fine of course will settle below the coarse. I believe however in clean straw, and think it is the best mulching we have, and I have always taken precaution to avoid that which contained an unusual portion of seed. I know there are injuries occurring from too heavy mulching of manure, and that is my experience and I know of others who have had the same experience. And while Mr. Clifton has to use a certain amount of caution as well as others still he has been very successful, but on the other hand, I have given my opinion in regard to my own experience. Mr. Clifton: I would like to add; a person must use judgment in any kind of work. I remember one neighbor who piled on the straw about a foot thick, and you can all imagine what the result was, he had no berries. He thought if a little was good a whole lot was better. The thickness of mulching that I recommend is about three inches of strawy manure. After the first season we have about four times as many plants on the ground as Is absolutely necessary, and you </seg>

For the general purposes of marketing, I have used the Senator Dunlap for many years. Right here, I wish to get hold of a berry that was about ten days or two weeks later than the Senator Dunlap, if it was possible. Although the Dunlap is the best berry for commercial purposes here, we can hardly hold them up any longer than we can get to town with them. Mr. Smith: Have you ever tried the Gibson? A No, I tried the Oren two or three yean, and what time I had it. it gave very good success as a later berry, but I haven't planted any late years. A Lady Spectator: Do you consider it necessary to fertilize the land always, before planting the new plants. A You will get better results always if you do that. Q What is the best method of applying manure, by a spreader or by hand? A I would use a regular manure spreader every time. Q There is no danger of hurting the ground by running over the ground with a spreader is there? A Not when the ground is frozen up. The President: Mr. Dwyer at Nebraska City on one of his com - mercial beds there planted oats along about the first of August and got quite a growth of oats, and he said he is going to quit hauling straw, he is going to plant the oats. That is the first year he ever tried it, but if it proves a good thing, it Is something that we all want to know about. He is the manager of the Morton estate there, and he runs a regular experiment station. So far it has made a perfect mulch, it grew up and never hurt the berries, and when the frost killed them down, they just kind of loped over the berries. Mr. Williams: The only objection I would see to that would be the drain on the soil and it would dry out the soil. The President: I am not going to make any objections to it until I see how Dwyer comes out with It. Mr. Smith: With a demand for straw especially along the river where strawberries are grown to any extent, It is a pretty live question. The President: It certainly is. Mr. Clifton: I can see where that would make a good mulch, but when you take the first crop of plants the next spring it takes nearly all of that season for the new plants to get well enough roots and put them into a condition for the next year's crop, and if you have your soil drained, and take the moisture out of it. It does not do to well. It looks to me as though you were robbing the moisture from the ground, that should go into the ground for the next season, and that is very essential to the preservation of the moisture as much as possible. The Presdlent: We will get a report from Mr. Dwyer at our next </seg>

Now half the game of making the living, is to grow it, and the other half is distribute it. and sell it, and get the money, accommodate the trade 1 keep up the business. We have asked Mr. William Beachley Jr.. nager of the People's Grocery store of Lincoln Nebraska to address upon the subject of "Selling Vegetables from a Retail Store." SKLLIXG VEGETABLES FROM A RETAIL STORE I»&gt; Mr. William Beachley Jr. Mr. Beachley: I am sorry I haven't even a paper here this morn - ing to offer you. The matter of selling vegetables and your products in the retail stores has been my business for more than fifteen years. I have never considered it a very desirable business; it is human for a man to envy the other fellow's job, and he thinks the other fellow has all the pleasures, and his own job is made up of 98 per cent of Eries and thoubles, and I have always considered the j 9 along that line. But if you know your goods, and siasm there is no reason in the world why you cannot i of it. Right there gentlemen I am reminded of a story of t ne named Pat and one named Mike, who left New York and came est. One settled in Oklahoma and the other settled in California, nally Pat who had settled in Oklahoma went to visit Mike who was len living in California. Having arrived in California he was re - ived in a very open hearted manner. Mike was taking him around le city and through the country and showing him the different sight* the State of California but upon each occasion of being shown me of the wonders of ihe state of California, Pat would remark bout the wonderful onions and wonderful potatoes, and wonderful &gt;eaches and things which they grew and raised in the state of Okla- Iina. Finally it became almost unbearable to have to listen so ich to the wonderful things raised in Oklahoma, and he was cer - nly glad when Pat at last remarked one day that the time for his it was up and he must return to Oklahoma. In about a year Mike o lived in California died. About a year or two later Pat died, ey were wondering around through the avenues of heaven one day i they chanced to meet one another. Mike who had never forgotten t's allusions to the wonders of Oklahoma, cast his eyes about over the iris and gold upon the streets and castles in heaven and remarked Pat, "Pat Heaven hasn't got it over Oklahoma so much after all, has " And so gentlemen, you will get the point which I wish to bring me to you, and that is, that when you just have to think of it, no i business has all its advantages, and no one business has all the advantages, and possibly my business is as good as yours and yours </seg>
            <seg id="p146">SELLING VEGETABLES FROM A RETAIL STORE 123 is as good as mine, and a business is only what we make it, what we \ &lt; ink about it, and what we ourselves care to put into It. ry is logically speaking the purchasing agent for the communities in which the grocer is located. He must know for the want he must sell service, and at the present time. tiic wonderful factor in the selling of goods. If we could servi figure the precentage of profit upon the price which the grocers are asking today, we would all get rich, but you must remember that Ml those prices must be discounted a great deal in order to arrive at price which the grocer gets before he can begin to count You must take into consideration the automobile delivery, •ep of your machine, the location of the store, keeping up of the raise in the wages to your help, the advance in the whole- t and all things which go to make up the initial cost, even rocer sells his goods at retail, must be taken into eonsid - re you figure the grocer's profit. hat the buying of goods is practically as necessary »» buying of goods is probably as interesting to you as The old saying that "Goods well bought are half sold." iday as well as one hundred years ago. The fact that ners who bring the stuff in in the morning, and I can say ieners are all salesman, if you ever noticed a gardener ivagon. and noticed the nice red radishes which are all i p liere in bunches, and the nice heads of cabbage, and most nes on top, then you will understand what I mean. The the average grocer makes Is over buying of fresh ;^ The remark will be made that probably tomorrow we will ha rain, and asparagus does not grow well in the rain. r grasps the Idea that in order to take care of y ill have to buy a few more bunches of asparagus. The is, when you open up the next morning you have t over from the day before, and your competitor is -paragus from the gardener, and the sun is shining brightly. It is so much better to open up your store with a full line egetables, than to carry anything over, I don't want to critize ners, I know they can come back at the grocers with any number of criticisms if they so desire. And right there I am reminded of ar er story. Paderewski, the noted pianist, was one day walk- ing (low the streets of Boston when he was accosted by a small news boy, who asked the great genius if he desired his shoes shined. Pad - erewski looked down at his shoes which were nice and well cleaned and shined, and then at the dirt ragged boy with his dirty hands and face, and he spoke to the boy and said, "Why my boy I am surprised that you should approach me and ask if I desired my shoes shined, when my shoes are well shined. On the other hand you appear to me to be badly in need of having your hands and face washed. Here is a quarter take the quarter and get yourself cleaned up." The boy </seg>
            <seg id="p147">124 looked up at the great pianist, and without a moments hesitation re - plied, "Say mister you had better keep that quarter yourself and go and get your hair cut. It looks as if you need that worse than I do to have my face washed." So you see if I were to critlze the gardeners too much, possibly they would have too much to say about the grocers You know we are all alike, and we know our own faults much better and know where they are probably a whole lot better than you do. Do you know that here in the city of Lincoln, with our popula - tion, the demand for head lettuce is simply wonderful. You take leaf lettuce at this time of the year, and it is used for nothing else than garnishing, and slightly for salad. The lettuce that is consumed on the table practically in the majority of the homes, is head lettuce. That is what we grocers of the city are looking for, and you men who have brought on the everbearing strawberries about which I listened this morning, and all these new ideas in gardening and fruit growing, that is what we want to find out about. What we are looking for, is a way, whereby we can have head lettuce in our city. There is no reason why we cannot, as they have it in other localities. You take take the demand for cucumbers, and the demand is practically the same throughout the year. It seems to me that we sell more cucum - bers during the fall and winter than in the summer and spring, for the table use I mean, and not for pickling. We are buying them from the jobbers, and the jobbers in Des Moines and Council Bluffs have one of the largest places in the country for the growing and distribu - tion of cucumbers. Practically 100 per cent of the cucumbers shipped into our city in the last few weeks have been frozen. I suppose that every grocer in the back of this room has a half a dozen cucumbers in water at this time to send out to the trade, trying to think of some way he can dispose of them. The fact of the matter is, that the minute you take them out of the water they will wither. The regulation bunch of vegetables Is something that the average grocer is interested in. You do not know how much is in the average bunch of asparapus, that is sent to your home. I would like to see the men interested in the growing of vegetables have a regulation bunch of asparagus. One man will have a bunch of asparagus that he sells for fifty cents and another one for thirty cents, and it is not fair to the grocer or the trade, and I wish that the vegetables men would get together and decide on a certain regulation bunch. It would benefit the trade, and the grocery man. Now we have heard about a municipal market house. I do not know what the gardeners think about that. I have never heard any of the gardeners express themselves on this municipal market house, but I believe you should refrain from accusing the grocers of not be - ing in favor of this municipal market house. We are, to a certain extent. You take my store, for instance we buy lettuce and radishes from one man, and asparagus and another vegetable from another one, and the fact of the matter is, we are kept buying these vegetables </seg>

Now it would be much more satisfactory to us to send our wagon with our buyer down to the mar - ket house, and have them on display at the store by eight o'clock In the morning, and I think when I say this I speak for the majority of the grocers. We have no objection to the establishment of a municipal market house in Lincoln. I have not said very much about the selling of groceries and vegetables. I really don't know what I ran say very much that will interest in that line. Now as a rule, when you go into a grocery store, all of the clerks are very much interested in making their sales, as large as possible, and they use various methods, but the question I wish to bring to you is where I think of selling an article, I want to put back of it courtesy, and that is certainly one thing that is a big factor in making friends in your store. If a customer comes in, see that he receives courteous tretament and attention. Have you ever tried to improve on the salesmanship. Great strides have been made in that in the last few years, over the old-fashioned method, and being honest with your customer is really the only way to be successful with your customer. You can fool a lady today by telling her these peas have just been received, and when she gets them home, she knows that is not true and they are two or three days old. That is not salesmanship — It is far better to tell her those peas are two or three days old, and we would rather have you wait until tomorrow and she will probably buy some - thing else then. It pays to do that, and not to substitute. The sub - stitution of an article is sometimes very unpleasant to a housewife. She orders two or three bunches of asparagus, and the grocer thinks possibly she won't like this asparagus, and he will send her out some - thing else or as the case might be a different brand of goods of some kind. Substitution in this line is probably more frequent than with vegetables. The display of the vegetables or whatever you want to sell is probably the most potent factor of the salesmanship game. When you go in and see a line of vegetables displayed so nicely it is really appetizing to a customer. The article which I have here in my hand I just received the other day, and it pertains particularly to this part of my talk. Here is a little part of it which I whould like to read to you. It says, "Begin the day right. Start the morning with a smile, and a cheery word, and see that your clerks do. Also see that all the telephone conversations are not only courteous but pleasant, in tone as well, and at the present time with a down town grocery the telephone girl handles practically 75 per cent of it's busi - ness, and it is up to the grocery to see that those telephone calls are answered promptly and are answered by pleasant and courteous girls and men." In closing I would say that another great feature of the sales - manship end of the business is that you must get your goods out where the people will see them. Not necessarily and not only must you get canned goods out and display a lot of packages and cans. </seg>
            <seg id="p149">126 NEBRASKA STATE HORTK ULTURAL SOCIETY but the people upon seeing them must know what they are, and must be able to tell the difference between the differnt kinds as well as the different grades of goods which you have on display. In suniing up it appeals to me that courteous treatment, honest and fair deal - ing, the lack of substitution of articles, but trying as far as it is in your power to give your customer what she wants, and prompt de - livery service are the main points of the selling game in my line of business. I wish to thank you for your courteous attention. 12 o'clock Noon, January 18th, 1917. The Society adjourned to meet at 2 o'clock p. ni. of the same day. 2 o'clock p. in. January 18th, 191 The Society met pursuant to adjournment and the followin ceedings were had and done. The President: This afternoon we will take up the sut 'Potatoes." The potato industry in Nebraska, and especially in \V tern Nebraska has mm greatly into prominence during the years. The first paper upon the program this afternoon w il livered by Mr. F. M. S&lt;-idell, County Agent Box Butte liance, Nebraska, and upon the subject ' The Important braska Potato Industry. THK IMPORTANCE OF 1HK POTATO IMKN'IKV IX HKMKI NEBRASKA By t\ M. Seidell, County Agricultural Agent, Alliance. i;&lt;&gt;\ I County, Nebraska The potato industry in Western Nebraska one of the leading phases of Nebraska's agricult Nebraska's leading cash crop. At present there is State that is receiving so much attention fro \ \ cultural Extension service and the United States Department of Agr culture as the potato. In fact it was through the Ext that the real significance of the industry \v;ts recognized and t assistance given the potato growers. To day the most important potato counties have their county agents. The industry is so important that many of the leading Agricultural Journals, dailies, local press, land agents, potato growers, and prospective potato growers are constantly calling upon the Extension Service for information regarding the im- portance and all phases of the Western Nebraska Potato Industry. As a potato producer Nebraska stood 10th, 12th, and 13th in total production among all the states of the United States in 1914, 1 and 1916 respectively. A study of a production map shows that po - tatoes are grown quite extensively in every state in the Union. In 1916 Nebraska's shipping of potatoes stood 7th in the United States in spite of the fact that some parts of this potato section experienced dryer weather than ever before. According to the bureau of crop </seg>
            <seg id="p150">IMPORTANCE OF THE POTATO INDUSTRY 127 stimates the total value of Nebraska's potato crop in 1916, at $1 per bushel, is $1,600,000 or three times the value of the sugar beet crop of the Platte Valley. The commercial potato section of Nebraska covers that portion the state lying west of a north and south line through Broken Bow and North of an East and West line through North Platte. ThU section lies entirely west of the proverbial twenty-four Inch rainfall The elevation varies from 2,000 feet of the east to 4,500 feet ■ west, with an average elevation of about 3,000 feet for the acre. The mean average temperature of this section is about 48 degrees plus, with very cool nights during the growing season. The the potato sections proper are silt loams, fine sandy loams, fine sand, and gravely sandy loam. e main potato areas within the western Nebraska section are the nds of the entire Box Butte County, the North half of Sheridan the central part of Dawes including the park lands, and the il part of Sioux County; all these soils being a silt loam, with • rage elevation of about 4,000 feet; the fine sandy loam acres E. Cherry, north central Brown and West central rock counties, rigated sections of Scotts Bluff, Morrill, Sioux and Kimball coun- many other places within the section that produces potatoes in l&gt;ss limited quantities. The main potato shipping points in order of their importance &gt; the quantity shipped, etc., are; Hemingford, Gordon, Rushville, Ilia net-, Morrill, Ainsworth. Hay Springs, Kimball, Belmont, Marsland, linton, Long Pine, Scotts Bluff, Mitchell, Crawford, Broken Bow. Johnston, Minitare, Bayard, Oskosh, Valentine, Chadron and many other small shipping points along the lines of the Burlington and ih»- Northwestern of the Sand Hill area. From the above shipping )ints at least 2,500 six hundred bushel cars will be loaded with the 916 crop. This means at least 1,500,000 bushels of potatoes will be pped for which the growers will average one dollar per bushel. As to the part the potato crop plays in successful farm mauage- n Box Butte County, which may be taken as typical of the po- tato section of North Western Nebraska, this is clearly shown by the farm management surveys conducted covering the 1914, 1915, 1916 crop seasons. Horses, cattle, dairy products, hogs poultry of all kinds, alfalfa, wild hay, winter and spring wheat, rye, barley, beans and potatoes are the main source of income. With average farm receipts of the above period of about $2,500 per farm it was found that the receipts on potatoes averaged about one-fifth of the total re- ceipts. Thus the importance of the crop from a farm management standpoint. Only early maturing varieties of potatoes are adapted to the conditions of the Nebraska potato section. The Early Ohio is the common variety. The leading variety of potato grown under irriga - tion is the Pearl, a large white variety and a high yielder. In the </seg>
            <seg id="p151">128 non-irrigated section, which constitutes the main part of the potato section, the Early Ohio, a consistant steady yielder, is grown chiefly. This is the variety that has made the Western Nebraska Potato fam - ous. In the vicinity of Alliance there is a variety of Flat Cobbler, called the white Eureka, and some Irish Cobblers. Both are good yield - ers and are grown for table stock exclusively. This section is also noted for the production of the Bliss or Red Triumph variety, which is in demand for the Southern seed trade. This seed is shipped to Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Tennessee, and some to Kansas. One-third of the potatoes grown in the vicinity of Hemingford are of this variety. This variety is usually stored in large storage cellars at the loading stations until mid-winter. Home grown seed is used in the western Nebraska potato section. In preparing the land for the potato crop it is usually plowed as early in the spring as possible and follows small grain or corn. The best yield of the best quality of potato is usually secured on land fol - lowing a cultivated crop such as corn. Potatoes are not planted fol - lowing potatoes. Following the plowing the preparation of the seed bed is similar to the preparation for surface planted corn Potatoes are being treated more and more as the value of such practice is recognized through experience and demonstration. Pota - toes are usually cut with a commercial potato cutter, but hand cutting is considered the best method as it makes it possible to discard all un - sound potatoes from the seed. The tendency in the past has been to use the poor, unmarketable potatoes for seed. This is a practice that has proven detrimental to the industry. Planting for commercial purposes starts from about the satni time as corn planting to a little later. The bulk of potatoes are plant ed between May 15th and June 15th. This planting date is usual!; a surprise to the Eastern Nebraska farmer. The potatoes are planted with either one or two man row type of commercial planter. The towf are usually standard planted width and the potatoes are planted (usually two-eye pieces) from twelve to twenty-four inches apart in the row. The rate of planting varies from 5 to 8 bushels in the non - irrigated section to as high as twelve bushels in the irrigated section. After the potatoes are up and thereafter the cultivation practiced is similar to corn culture. The ground is kept level until the last culti - vation when some dirt is thrown to the plants in order to protect the tubers that may be near the surface from sunburn and frosts. The diseases of potatoes in this section which show up in the fields are quite common to all potato sections. In fact many of the most destructive and the most expensive to control of all potato diseases are not found in this as in other potato sections. Late blight and potato bugs are unknown to this upland section of Western Ne - braska. In rival potato sections these are controlled by the expensive process of spraying. The former is not present because of the low humidity and the latter because of the altitude and the cool nights </seg>
            <seg id="p152"/>
            <seg id="p153">IMPORTANCE OF THE POTATO INDUSTRY 129 during the growing season. During the past two seasons some trouble wes experienced with early blight. Ordinarily this disease in unknown. Fusorium wilts, stem rot or rhizoctonia, bacterial wilt, and leaf curl are found to some extent in the growing fields of potatoes. These diseases are practically all more or less controlable by proper rotation, seed selection and seed treatment. Cut worms, grub worms, pocket gophers, and some potato bugs in the eastern section, are the common insect troubles. None of these are serious as to injure the industry to any great extent. Scab and dry rot are the diseases affecting the tubers. Digging starts about Septembeer 1st in the eastern part of the area, and by October 1st the digging of the western Nebraska potato is in full swing. Yields vary from 50 to 250 bushels per acre depend - ing upon the variety and the moisture condition during the season. The diggers used are the elevating four-horse type. Generally the pickers follow as close to the diggers as is practical allowing the potatoes to dry some. They pick in wire half-bushel baskets and usually four pickers to each double box wagon. From one hundred to two hundred bushels per day by each picker is considered a good day's work. In some cases the grader with sacker attached is hauled through the field and the potatoes dumped upon it by the pickers. This is quite an economical method as potatoes are handled only the one time and few are bruised, tnere is little shrinking, and all potatoes are large enough regardless of size, shape or quality to pass into the sack. Some pota - toes are hauled direct from the field to the car where they are scooped over the grader. Most potatoes are stored in pits until the digging Is over, and then graded and hauled to market. A few growers store their potatoes in cellars from which they may be hauled after digging is completed or may be stored until spring. During the potato digging season the price of labor is from $2.50 to $3.50 per day. In marketing the potatoes they are generally sold to local dealers who usually have warehouse facilities; to large commercial firms or their representatives; to the small dealer from a distance; and in some cases the potatoes are shipped direct to the consumer or to some dis - tant dealer. Most of the potatoes are sold by the growers in the bulk. Some are even ungraded. Growers are coming to realize the import - ance of grading and sacking their potatoes. In the past the growers had no reliable information as to the price they should receive for their potatoes. Many were sold under contract or when delivered to the loading station they received what the other growers were receiving. Through the activity of the western Nebraska county agents and the agricultural extension service a branch office of Markets and Rural Organization of the U. S. Department of Agriculture was located at Alliance during the potato shipping season of 1916. From this office an average of 1,800 Market News Bulletins, giving the prices of pota - toes at that morning's city markets, shipping prices from loading stations of the day before, destination of all potatoes from the potato </seg>
            <seg id="p154">130 section of western Nebraska, and shipments from producing sections was furnished daily without cost, to the potato growers and dealers of western Nebraska and other sections that applied for the bulletins. Thirty-eight bulletins were issued approximating about 70,000 copies. Estimates from 720 growers' banks, and farmers organizations indi - cate that the growers of western Nebraska received at least an aver - age of twenty cents more per bushel with the service than they had received without it, and without additional cost to the customers. This meant a saving to the growers of over $400,00. A study of the distribution of the 1916 Nebraska potato crop, based upon the reports made by the railroads to the Office of Markets, show that her potatoes up until the time the first 1,800 cars were shipped had reached their final destination in Eastern Nebraska, Wyoming, Iowa, South Dakota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Minnesota, Colora - do, Arkansas, Indiana, Missouri, Louisiana, Tennessee, Kansas, Okla - homa and Texas. With the Market News Service continued, the potatoes improved and standardized, Potato Organizations formed, and thousands of un - filled acres in western Nebraska waiting to grow potatoes developed; then Nebraska should stand foremosa as the greatest potato producer in the Nation. Discussion. Mr. Keyser: Did I understand Mr. Siedell to say that a potato association had been organized or formed? Mr. Siedell: No, I said that was my proposition. I might say, "That we had a representative of the office of markets" last spring in Alliance, who talked about organization. That is he presented some of the problems that our growers must face in organization work. And just at that time in that particular place we felt we could go along another season or two before organizing a Box Butte Potato Growers Association at least. The President: The next subject is by Mr. Fritz Knorr of Mit - chell, Nebraska, on "Cultural Methods." And Mr. Knorr is not here, and I am sorry. I know that he would have given us a very good talk. He comes from the section of the state that we tried to have represented. We must take up the next subject on the program which will be by Mr. Link Davis of Gordon Nebraska, upon the subject of "Growing Potatoes without Irrigation." GROWING POTATOES WITHOUT IRRIGATION By Mr. Link Davis, of Gordon, Nebraska. Mr. Link Davis: Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen. I am glad to be able to talk upon this important question. They could have se - cured a more able person to have discussed the matter, but if I can give you any information along that line, I will be only too glad to do </seg>
            <seg id="p155">GROWING POTATOES WITHOUT IRRIGATION 131 it. I still live on the claim that I honiesteaded in 1885. I have plant - ed thirty-one crops of potatoes on that place. In my first experience with the potato business we were very successful in raising potatoes, of a very good quality. But we had no market to reap any great profit from and so I did not take the interest in the work that I have in the last fifteen years. When it got so that I could make my potato crop* balance up my accounts, I began to take an interest in potato raisins. When the potato became such an important thing commercially and it being a staple article, I gave it more attention and study, I have reach - ed the conclusion that I can take any part of my country up there where they get from ten to eighteen inches of rain and I can raise a successful crop every year. I haven't had a failure in the last fifteen years; this may be a little boastful, but I want to fix it upon your mind, that what I have accomplished in Northwestern Nebraska In raising successful crops, others can do. We all know that our rain is irregular. Those parties at the State Farm possibly do not take that so much into consideration as we do there. We know we get extremely heavy thunder s'orms. We have to so cultivate and handle our soil as to conser-. e as much of that water as possible. 1 want to impress upon your mind this one thing, that in ail of my cultivation I first pre - pare my ground so to be able to conserve as much of the moisture that we are expecting to get throughout the season as possible. In order to do that I commence working my ground early. I have already gone over my potato ground twice with a pulverizer preparing it for next season. That ground is a thing I want to impress upon your mind. We know that when we get those little skiffs of snow that if we can hold them equally divided all over the ground, it is a preserver to the ground throughout the winter. If we get the big snows, we do not want them to drift any more than possible. I always use stubble ground for po - tatoes. I rotate my crops, and I aim to plow every third and some - times fourth year, I preserve the stubbles to catch the snow and I prepare my ground to catch, hold and maintain all the moisture I pos - sibly can. The first thing I do after the harvest, is to put some one behind the binder with a disc of the same width as the binder, I put upon that disc a one hundred and fifty pound weight upon each end and if possible aim to have the weight of a good heavy man in the middle, so you can see that I have it well weighted. I throw my disc about one half in gear. I do not want to turn over the whole surface of the ground, nor throw dirt upon the stubble. I want to open it up. spread a little loose dirt over the ground, still getting down into the ground as deep as possible, I want a little gutter where the disc runs. I double disc in the fall of the year. I sometimes fail to do this at harvest time for the simple reason that the ground is not in proper condition. Therefore I get my grain taken care of as soon as possible, and at the first opportunity after we get a rain I put my ground in shape. I prepare to go over that ground in the summer sea- </seg>
            <seg id="p156">132 son in the manner I have stated. In that way I roughen up my ground, loosening it up to a certain extent, and I leave the stubble there to protect the ground and to catch the snow. That roughening will help to conserve the moisture. Now if we have quite a bit of rain during the fall, I go over that again in the same manner I did in the first place. You see I am trying to conserve the moisture we get through out the fall of the year, and during harvest time. In the spring as soon as the ground is thawed out sufficiently and I can do a good, decent job of pulverizing, and I go onto it with the pulverizer. I only disc it over once, and I am very careful to disc it as true as possible. In a few weeks or days, as soon as the condition of the ground is right — let me state here, that I am very careful before I go onto the ground to notice the condition it is in. If it is reasonably wet or a little too wet to do the proper job I wait until it gets a little dryer, but never wait until it gets too dry. I keep that up until plowing time. Now, if I was putting out some grain, I would plow early, but I am putting out potatoes in this case, and I put off my plowing until the last thing just before I commence planting. I have neighbors who go to work early in the spring and plow all the ground they expect to plant to potatoes. They make a mistake doing this. Possibly I may cultivate my land six to eight times, before the time conies to plow it. It depends a good deal on the condition of the land, and the kind of season we had the previous year. I always do sufficient plowing to hold the moisture. The old rule for planting potatoes in my childhood days, was to com - mence planting on good Friday. I quite often do that in our country up there. I may possibly want an early car load of potatoes to put onto the market. I may have looked ahead and saw the conditions and possibilities over the country for an early market, and I might com - mence if the weather permits on Good Friday. I never consider Good Friday any better than any other day for planting potatoes. I may commence on Good Friday, and finish by planting on the 28th to the 30th. of June. I give myself plenty of itme to do this work without Piaking it rush work, and without its becoming a tiresome job at all concerned. I start my plowing, when I have my seed potatoes cut. to. plant the ground I want to plant that in. I have got a man to get pota - to planter ready. If I commence on the morning of Good Friday to plow my ground. I have five to seven acres of potatoes when I com - mence. Now then I want to carry along with the cultivation of the po - tatos as we go along in preparing this ground for the plowing, I wanted it to carry me from the first of July from Good Friday. How deep shall we plant? If I am planting real early. I must get them out of the way of the late frost and freezes, and snow storms in May. Well what are you going to do with potatoes in the ground, when I have seen the ground freeze three inches along about the tenth to the fifteenth day of May. None of our grain ever rots, and it is more liable to petrify than it is to rot. So you see I put my seed about four or </seg>
            <seg id="p157">Making L. S. by Steam </seg>
            <seg id="p158">GROWING POTATOES WITHOUT IRRIGATION 133 five inches in the ground. I leave my ground as rough as possible, so that it will catch as much of the snow or rain that may come. Now after I put my potatoes in, as soon as I can get over that ground which is usually the same day, I go over it with a 26 foot light weight 160 tooth wood harrow. I do not use anything else in the way of a harrow. I plow my ground just as deep as I can plow it unless it is pretty new ground. If it is new ground, I never take up more than an inch and a half if possible of new dirt. Keep going down until I get it as deep as a common plow would plow it. There are two rea - sons for that. I want as much ground as possible to conserve my moisture in, and I want as much ground as I can get to raise my crops on. It is true that you can raise a good crop of potatoes on shallow plowing sometimes, but you can always raise a good crop of potatoes up there on deep plowing, and it takes a little careful cultivation, and you will be twice as sure to raise a good crop of small grain. Now then I commence as I said before, and I continue my plwoing about every week for potatoes. For instance use two days out of the week for plowing and planting potatoes, or probably four days for plowing and two days for planting. I use nothing but two row cultivators, and two row planters. I use the Eureka Picker planter. For one par - ticular reason it is very wide from wheel to wheel. Your shoes run in here, and you stradle your two rows, and you do not injure your ground. Now I am going to meet with some opposition right here. You take the common run of our growers, and they will say if you pack your ground you are going to get a better stand. You will do that no doubt, but the ordinary planter will get a better stand if he packs his dirt on top of his seed. I practiced that until I have it up, and I use two different kinds of planters while I was doing that. Mind yon, whenever I take hold of something new that I do not know much about, I go at it very carefully and easily, and follow my old plan, until 1 figure which one is the best, and possibly then I will go over to the new, but I am forever experimenting to a certain extent. I do not want any weight on the fellow behind the planter, and neither do I want a roller on my ground, and neither do I want a drag on my ground ahead of the planter, becausel am planting right ahead of the plow, and I want my drag after that, and that is all I want at a time. Now we will say we will get along, and we have had three or four plantings along that way. and we are getting into the fore part of May and that is when our season begins to get a little dry, then we must prepare a little more to preserve that moisture. We must be a little more careful. I probably have a man or two working on the other ground, and pulverizing that at intervals to keep that in shape to keep the moisture there. If we have had a bit of rain up to the time po - tatoes are just coming up and my ground becomes thoroughly packed, I go into it with a cultivator and cultivate it just as deep as possible, and roll it up over the ridge. I just simply follow the tracks of the </seg>
            <seg id="p159">134 planter. Sometimes my potatoes are up a little, but I pay no attention to that, and then I follow that up with the weeder, and most of the time with the drag. I have my ground in perfect condition then for it to go on and possibly we may get another rain. Well the ground is loose and it will take care of the moisture that is on there unless it comes in a regular torrent, and you will conserve the ordinary moisture. After I get it that way I go ahead of my planting right along through. Now 1 do not want a furrow of land plowed before I get ready to plant it two or three days ahead of time. If I am a day or two behind with the planter, and I have the plow with the drag, if that is the case, be - fore I am ready to plant, I plant before I drag. One of the most important things is the seed. I must give Mr. Wilcox the credit of a great deal of this line, and he has been at my place two different times and has experimented for different diseases, and also we have swapped ideas along this potato line. Now then 1 take a potato of that size or a little smaller, I do not want to plant them any smaller if I can help if, but about that size (indicating) three inches long by two inches round. In my way of planting pota - toes I put them in from 24 to 36 inches apart in a row, and I will give you my reasons for that a little later on. Half of that potato, not because it has lots of eyes or anything of that kind, but it is the potato that is there (indicating potato in his hand). Now if I have to plant It in reasonably wet soil it won't rot, and if I have to plant it in reason - ably dry soil, it won't dry up. 1 have neither got rotten seed, nor I haven't dried seed; I have a good strong stem, possibly two and some - times three, and all of the eyes in that seed do not grow. Well, this carries me along with my drouth. I have the seed that will stand it. and if I want seed potatoes to raise seed potatoes, I will take one about that size (indicating potato 2%x2), I will cut that in four pieces. I do not want to raise a great big potato. I want to raise something that is nearly perfect. I will take that and cut it into four pieces. That makes me the same kind of seed that I will have out of the smaller seed. Now if you want a good big potato to put onto the market, and something that will take the eyes of the market wherever you put it, take a big potato. Something like that (indicating about 6x2.% in.) cut it four eyes to the piece, and it is more apt to get large potatoes. But wherever you are apt to get dry ground in a drouth country, plant them from 24 to 36 Inches in the row. Then you have double the moisture, and you have a better chance to get a good growth out of your potatoes. Then you are going to get the proper size for the market. I found to my satisfaction, that where I want to raise a big fine potato I will take that kind of a seed. If I want to raise a market potato, I will take that medium sized potato, and I want to raise a lot of small potatoes, I wlil take that small potato and I will give it one eye to the piece, and if I want a half a stem, I will cut it one eye to the piece, because it is too often that the case that the seed will dry or rot. </seg>
            <seg id="p160">GROWING POTATOES WITHOUT IRRIGATION 135 Now I continue this method of cultivation along that line, and some seasons 1 will raise a good crop of potatoes with two cultivations. I found it necessary to give my potatoes five cultivations some seasons. You can not set a regular rule to go by. That is the conditions of the ground always. Now then in early plowing lots of dragging, and lots of work on the surface, and shallow cultivation of course is worthless; of course about along the first of July you will notice a dry pan under the top of your dust mulch, along about the first of July there is a dry pan under there. I will venture to say everyone of you who raised po - tatoes in that dry country there have found that dry pan under your dust mulch. You may have it looking ever so nice on top, but there i» the dry pan underneath. Now then if you will take my method, whenever your ground gets very ■wet so that it will stand a deep culti - vation, go down as deep as possible, and you will do away with that, but if you do have hard pan under there befoer it gets so everlasting hard and thick, try and break it up, and take your thick shovel culti - vator, and take the two inside shovels, and raise them up as high as ]&gt;o»ible. and put the others down as low as possible and get down about as deep as possbile and follow your cultivator with the weeder. Some - times you will hurt them a little, I will tell you from experience I have found out it is winning profits. I do not want anything to do with that hard pan under my dust mulch. Now I follow that out through clear the summer season; now then comes the kind of a potato that is the most successful, and that is the easiest to raise a crop from, and it comes from this kind of treatment. I care not what variety of potatoes you take, I can raise any of them there. But you will take those potatoes, such as I had here, and you will notice they will get out from the stalk or out from the seeds, say 6 to 8 inches sometimes, and you will find a potato out on the root there, and it stays out there and you cannot thoroughly cultivate and take care of your potatoes and guard against the drouth, in that way. If you are satisfied you are not going to have plenty of moisture, that is the kind of a potato to raise, but in my caae the bigger the field, the better, the longer the row the better. Two years ago. I had my rows a mile long, and that suited me all the bet - ter. Now the Pink Triumph and the Early Ohio, are the two most successful potatoes with me. Why is that? Because they set on around the seed, and you can pretty nearly cultivate your potatoes so that you know just exactly where your seed Is goig to set on around your plant. Mind you. if your seed is in a pretty small patch of ground that you to dodge with a cultivator, and use careful cultivation it is harder of course, but being small you can naturally do it to greater advantage than you could on a larger plot of ground. Now I would not give fifteen cents for all the shields there are in the State of Nebraska or in the nation to put on my cultivators to go into the field and cultivate the potatoes. We loose them and we find them lying around the fence corners, and we try to get them out of the way, and I will try and tell </seg>
            <seg id="p161">136 you why. After my potatoes get up an inch to two inches I go over them after my ground is in proper shape with my cultivator, and I get it in just as thorough cultivation as I want to, and in the course of ten or twelve or thirty hours, after I go over it. Of course you could not throw a great big chunk over them, as big as a bushel basket, and expect that plant to come right on through, but if you had that ground in the perfect condition as well as that system will keep it, you are all right. By this way of cultivating you do away with the weeds. If have more weeds in the row, but none in the center of the row. Now we will say along about the first of July our ground gets pretty dry, and that is when you have to give it the most careful watching of all. We watch those dry spells and try to hold the moisture we have in the ground, and sometimes our hill planting is the best for that. Some - tomes the middle planting is the best; sometimes your late planting is the best. Well, what is the cause of it? You have got your proper amount of moisture after your potato has set on properly, and this is governed by the time you planted your potato. If you want early po - tatoes, you plant them early, and if you want later potatoes you plant them later. Now then about the first of July as I have told you, we have our ground in condition with expectations of a whole lot of dry weather, and from then up until about the first of August. Four years ago, I finished planting my seed on the 27th or 28th of June, and that seed did not come on part of the ground. I had a piece of gronud of eighty acres, that lacked -a half a days pulveriing crossways in the spring, and it had not been pulverized the fall before, and I had lost consider - able moisture out of that, and when we came up to that spring through the fall, we struck a dry streak, about each end of the field, and just part of it been so cultivated, that we had maintained and held the moisture in it. This strip of land through here, and through the cen - ter of the field that should have been pulverized was let go partially for an experiment, and partially because we wanted to get a plow start - ed lengthwise with the field ,and so we just put a little strip through there, we let this go until the latter part of our seeding, and that got so dry that I just plowed it and that was all there was to it. Well, now then I had fair sized seed, and it didn't dry out, so it lay there in the ground, and you could go to the field, and you could see the path there, and we had cultivated that and run over it with a disc and everything, but we didn't get any rain until the 6th day of August, and that rain fetched those potatoes up. We had corn on one side, and that was just about the same. No corn had come up in these rows, and not a potato hill. What was the result? Why, after the rain, that all came up. There is one thing I want to show you. Up to the last row in the ground, we had prepared to hold the moisture, up until the last hill, and the gentleman that farmed for me last year is right back there in the back part of the room, and he can substantiate this, and we </seg>
            <seg id="p162">Storing Apple Pit </seg>
            <seg id="p163">137 raised good potatoes, and a fair stock of corn, at that, and a fair sized ear on it, but we had good potatoes, and good marketable potatoes up until the last of the potato year. Well, what did it? It was the care - careful cultivation apd handling of that part of the ground, and the neglect of the other that caused the other to be so different. Now then after my potatoes are pretty well along, and about ready to mature, most people quit their cultivation; well, when they begin to look like they are going to ripen up, and they think they have their growth, but I have got some other work. At that time the harvest is on, and we are going to go on with the harvest, and neglect our potato patch, that is the way it is. That is when you should put some of your best work in on potatoes. Don't you know that the last cultivation will give you twice as much in dollars as any other cultivation will. You take the potatoe in our particular country, when they are beginning to look like they had run their race, and the potato vine is beginning to act as though it is going to dry out, your potato has gone ahead and got it's growth, and right at that time, I aim to give them a good cultivation, providing the ground is in proper shape. Now then, I am going to run up against a lot of opposition right there. I am in favor of ridging up my potatoes. As I said in the first place, I am in favor of putting the seed deep in the ground. We must have a deeper dust mulch than ever before all over the country. We want a dust mulch over two and a half to three inches deep. Well, I want my potatoes, all of them below that dust mulch, and the cut worm will never hurt your potato either, if they are that deep in the ground. They will not get so close to the potato, that they will kill the stalk. Then I want to ridge my potatoes up, and we will say along from the middle of August on, most of the people are apposed to ridging up the potato. Well it is a good deal owing to when they are ready for the market and so on, and how deep they are under the ground. Often times we go along and see potatoes sticking out of the ground. Well, with that extreme heat, and your dry ground don't you know that that potato cannot naturally be a good seed potato, and it cannot grow naturally. Don't you know that you have to have that potato down in the moist dirt where every time the sun comes out it wont hit the potato so hard, and where every time it gets a little cool it won't cool it through and kill it, or every early frost won't hurt it, because it is out of the way of the frost and out of the way of the sun. Then I turn in and I ridge them up, and I use the disc cultivator. By doing that, they have gone through a dry season. I do not want my ground to crack, and I fill up all the cracks there. I have my potato down under the ground, so that when these extreme hot days come, they do not get any of the excessive heat and where it is in the cool moist dirt all the time until it is throughly matured. There is another reason for ridging it up. Your potato digger will work a third easier on ridged ground, and you will get all your </seg>
            <seg id="p164">138 potatoes, where if you have it perfectly flat, then your digger must have a wonderful man to drive it, and it will push your potatoes out to the side, and you will run over them with your digger wheels, and scar them, and mash them up, but if you have the ridge there to saddle, you get all your potatoes in perfect shape, and some of your dirt will move to the outside, and leave your ground perfectly level. Now then there were eight of us on our market there buying potatoes at one time, when I was hauling my potatoes. I had a demand for the potatoes, and I was hauling in, and while our farm demonstrator had helped me a good deal this summer, I wanted to make known to the public generally, the condition of difference in my potatoes and the regular potatoes in that country, that were going onto the market. And we decided there was about a fifth if not a fourth difference in the price of them. The fact of the matter was I had a regular buyer for the po - tatoes mostly that 1 was bringing, and he would offer me from fifteen to twenty cents more for a car load of my potatoes than he would for the general run of potatoes. Now I must say that I endorsed all of the government and all of the state preparations that they have rec - ommended. They have kept our seed clean, and this Is a very important think that we should follow up. Now then if you want good clean stuff, and healthy and pure stuff you should be sure that you get it, and then be careful with the preparations to keep it pure, and I be - lieve if you will follow them thoroughly you will have no trouble with your potato worm. I do not see that I can do you any more good. This is my first talk upon this line, and when I first got word from Lincoln concerning this talk and that I was put on this program, my wife said, "Now you will have to get to work and fix up for this talk a little " Well now I said, 'You know I talk potatoes half the time, and if I can - not go down to Lincoln and talk potatoes for a half an hour I am no good." And so you have about all I know about it. Discussion The President: I feel that the prophecy 1 gave you that Mr. Davis would give us a good talk has been fulfilled. Now Mr. Davis while he has covered the situation in a thorough manner, he mentioned in a place or two, in his talk, some of you would take issue with him, let's have a discussion upon this talk. I must say that while I did not see his crop harvested, that he is putting into it all these things that he told us about, something at least has caused his potatoes to look mighty well. I do not know whether or not it was that or what it was, when I saw them. Anyway I saw many a potato field, and I know that his potato field looked good to me. A Member: I would like to ask something: Mr. Davis said something about his ground freezing while the potatoes were growing, I do not quite understand that? Mr. Davis: One particular day on the 6th day of May we had a </seg>
            <seg id="p165">139 blizzard, where it was 6 below zero, and after that blizzard I went out into some of my potato fields that had been planted and I walkeed along the row to turn up the frozen dirt on top, and I would find a potato once in a while, where the frost had touched it and after that I was always a little leary about that. Now understand me, while I have been there on this place for thirty-two years I have never seen two seasons exactly alike. You have to fight against the frost at any time, and therefore, we cannot say the exact time to plant or the exact time for the harvest in any certain years. But I do like to have potatoes down deep. By having my potato in there, and ridged up late in the fall, we can let the ground get pretty well cooled off, and I believe mil ol you will bear with me that if I take the potatoes out of the ground when it is cool, and when the potatoes have been cool and deep, they are better for putting away for winter use, and will keep better than at other times in the year. Now I would rather have one of those po - tatoes not quite matured, to keep over winter, than to have it in that matured shape (indicating a potato). I would rather take the potato at the time the frost struck it, than I could peel it a little with my finger, and run the risk of keeping it over the winter than I would to try and keep one that had ripened up three or four weeks before the frost came. Well, you have just got all the life and everything there is in that potato at the time of digging, and if you only have it in that state before it has laid there a month in hot dirt as we often have it before the first of October, it will be all right. But if it does lay there like that they are not in a condition to put away for the winter. One reason some of our potatoes do not keep any better is because we plant them too close to the top of the ground, and they get too much of that heat, along close to the fall, and that takes the life out of the potato by being continuously heated and it will not keep through the winter. I can go over patches with you, and tell you whether or not they are a good keeper or a bad keep, and I will venture that I will hit it nine times out of ten. In my case, I prefer planting twenty four to thirty - six inches. If I wanted to raise an awful nice potato or something that was showy, I would put it thirty-sixe inches apart, and if I wanted to raise a medium potato I would put it twenty-four niches apart, and if I wanted to raise a lot of little potatoes, I would put them twelve inches apart. If I was going to raise potatoes with a lot of weeds, I would rather have potatoes six inches apart in the row, than to have weeds in that space. Like all other parties advocating cultivation and the best of everything in potatoes, I have my own ideas, and will meet opposition at different times. I have had a good deal o fexperience with machine cutters, and I would prefer hand cutting everytime, and I believe it pays you. The President: The point that Mr. Davis brought out in regard to the potato maturing better under cool conditions when deeper in the ground, and it makes a better seed potato. I will say his ex- </seg>
            <seg id="p166">140 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY planation of that coincides with things that have been worked out with careful experimentations. I wonder if any of you have thought that the growers in the various western states and central states have to order their seed from the north each year? In some experiments car - ried on here it has been found that the difference in the keeping qual - ities in potatoes is due to the difference in the conditions under which those potatoes have been matured. An attempt has been made to im - itate those conditions in the north here, and whenever that has been done it has been demonstrated conclusively that the difference in the yield does not exist. It has been found that potatoes grown in eastern Nebraska under ordinary methods of cultivation will deteriorate about twenty-three per cent in yield if planted from home grown seed po - tatoes as compared with shipped in or northern potatoes. But if in - stead of .shipping them in, if we can mature our potatoes under cool conditions such as Mr. Davis has outlined, it has been found that we could get practically the same yield as potatoes grown in the red riv section or anywhere in the north. This is not the result of a sing year, it is the average for eight years, and so I think that he has sa there is perfectly sound, and it is right along the line of things th have been worked experimentally. Now the difference in conditioi does not effect you people so much because you are in the high al' tudes, where you have the cooler weather. A Member: I would like to get at about the best planting potatoes up in that northwestern quarter of the sta man plants eighty acres of potatoes, he cannot do it all in on Mr. Davis: You tell me th&lt; have, and I will tell you when to kind of a season w plant your potatoes. Q The kind of a season y years experience up there? ju have got to ex Mr. Davis: I have about I ai res of potatoes i probably two or three days out of circumstances, I can raise a crop the week. While I have — yet the more favorable pa season, it depends of course on the condition of your ground at the time your potato gets set on and about the size of a good sized marble up to the size of a hen's egg. Make your potato as quick as you possibly can, from then on. As regards to the best date to plant, I cannot an - swer that because it is impossible to tell whether we are going to get any rain during the season, and therefore I have adopted this rule of planting early medium and late. And I prefer planting for seed late, always. A Member: I have found that I get the best results from plant - ing late, around about the first of June. A Member: That is for early varieties? A Member: Yes Sir. </seg>
            <seg id="p167">DISCUSSION 141 Mr. Howard: What is your average yield, that is approximately jver the fifteen years Mr. Davis? Mr. Davis: Why around 100 bushel, but 1 would like to explain in that. Now 1 have neighbors that get bigger yields than I do for this reason. Their ground, on their ground they will plant small patches and in more favorable places, in the little draws and ravines and cool places. I am about seventy to eighty feet above water, and 1 take it over a ridge, and I go clear through the field, and make my rows a half a mile and a mile long, and I do not try to dodge any - thing, and I have about an average yield of 100 bushel to the acre, and it is nothing for me to raise two and three hundred bushel in favor - ite spots, and I believe I could carry out an experiment of 250 bushel fifteen acre tract. The President: The reports show that the average of the United s over a series of years is considerably less than that. A Member: I was just going to make a statement, that I have handled a great many potatoes that Mr. Davis has grown, and I bear n the statement of the keeping qualities of those potatoes. I ave handled potatoes by the thousands of bushels and car loads, nd bought them up in that country, and I am an old timer in that &lt; ountry, and those people are my acquaintances, and I will say this, I had my first experience in learning wha: I am going to mention np there. We have cyclones, cyclone caves in my country. And a son of mine had taken some potatoes from my car and he put them down in this deep, cold, wet, damp cave, and It was cool down there, and I said I don't believe they will ever keep there. And he said there is a cer- tain amount of dampness in potatoes and I am satisfied that this cool place will hold the moisture in them, and it did. Then I went on to experiment, and in our cellars we put out potatoes in racks, and some - times we sprayed those potatoes to moisten them and keep them moist and cool, and we have not been bothered with what we call dry rot in the winter time, and I thought that was a matter of Importance to people who live in the cities, for them to put their potatoes away from the furnace where it Is too warm. The President: Out time is a little limited. We see how much interest a talk of this nature can arouse. I do not know how often we can get together as an organization and have a program where -we talk nothing but potatoes. Our next talk Is by Mr. J. C. Milward, the Secretary of the Wisconsin Potatoes Grower's Association, of Madison. Wisconsin. Who will talk to you upon the subject of "Organisation and it's Importance to the Potato Grower. </seg>

The speaker has been asked to give a brief outline of the organiza - tion and work of a State Potato Growers Association and is directed to hold close to the actual activities and results of this work. Although the statements made here refer directly to the Wisconsin Potato Grow - ers Assot iation, the speaker knows, through many conferences with State leaders that these questions are common points for discussion in many commercial potato growing sections of the country. In 1912 at a call issued by the Wisconsin Experiment Station, representative potato interests organized the present State Association. The legislature immediately following recognized the important de - velopment and educational features of Association work and granted an annual appropriation in support. The Association is not a commercial organization. Although supported directly by State appropriation, the work is affiliated with the State Experiment Station in that the Staff Officer of the station in charge of potato extension work I the regular secretary of the Association. Five year's experience shows that leading commercial gr mi competitive marketing and shipping interests endorse and support this kind of an organization. In the conduct of Association affairs unusual efforts have been made to enlist the help and direction of successful growers, dealers, shippers and developmental agencie We can conceive that a state organization might exist fo delving in academic problems solely, aloof from the busy p&lt; dustry and it's affiliations. Some unpleasant criticism might I er by such a program. More to be desired, however, in the affairs of a state organization is a little attention and direction from men who have honest invest - ment in the industry; who have succeeded; who have a part in grow - ing and marketing potatoes or in other commercial relationships as - sociated with the industry. Five years of Association work in Wisconsin has resulted finally in closely correlating organized potato work with other state organ - izations. Several examples of the way this works out may be cited. The Commissioner of Agriculture desires that all Wisconsin Fair* shall correct and simplify their premium lists on potatoes. He ia anxious that his recommendation shall be consistent with the potato development work of the State. The Association premium list does not recognize over eight varieties adaptable to development work. About ninety per cent of the State show (the largest in America) is made up of two standard late varieties th.e Rural New Yorker, and the </seg>

            <seg id="p170">VARIETY STANDARDS 143 Green Mountain. The result is that Progressive Fair Secretaries in all potato growing section of the state adopt a premium list consistant with commercial conditions in their counties. Another example, the Superintendant of Farm Institutes decides to conduct a series of special potato institutes in March. He arranges a conference in the office of the State Potato Growers Association and decides upon a schedule covering some special, recommended territory. The President of the State Potato Growers Association is secured to conduct these institutes. Follow up field meetings are arranged under some direction in August, at which an automobile trip is arranged, vis - iting representative fields in each district. The Farm Institute office finances and directs this work, but secures the services of the potato Growers Association in carrying out its plans. VARIETY STANDARDS The State Association in a practical way determines plans of seed potato dissemination. This work is very often done under the direc- tion of the County Agricultural Representative. These men are not the most active agencies directing potato improvement work. For ex - ample in Oneida County, under the direction of the County Agent specialization is made on the Green Mountain for the late and the umph for the early variety. Some leading growers are also plant- Up' Hural New Yorker and the Irish Cobbler. The Rural New Yorker and the Green Mountain have been raised here for years under various names before attention was given to commercial potato rais- The varietal question is about straightened out and the county eloping along a definitely determined plan of specialization in l co-operation with all various state agencies concerned in this lopment. In the same way Waupaca County specializes on the Rural New Yorker exclusively. Lincoln County is developing the Green Mountain stock almost exclusively. Over the state at large the Rural New Yorker is best adapted nder conditions in Wisconsin. The State Association is therefore us- ing directly every possible influence in the field to see that seed dis - semination is continued with the special needs of each communtiy in view. Non-standard names have been eliminated. Concentration has been effected upon recognized adoptable varieties. In this field above all others, the State Association comes in direct touch with the grow - er, and it is in this field that most definite results have been secured. LAND AND FARM DEVELOPMENT FEATURES Land companies, the railroads and other organized agencies are active in the settlement of the new lands of the State. Settlers are </seg>
            <seg id="p171">144 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY continually coming; many from north and central European countries, where they have had experience in growing potatoes. Thousands of these men have proved very successful potato growers under the ad - vantages of new conditions. The need of commercial direction based on community needs as a rule is lacking unless provided for in combined effort, by commercial, developmental and state agencies. The Wisconsin Potato Growers Association has been active in co-operating with the leading railroads of the state and other development interests in directing community development. Special potato exhibit cars have been operated on rail - road lines in all of hte new sections of the state. Here again it is misleading to single out any one influence in this work. As far as potato organization work is concerned it is affiliating with all the other commercial and organized agencies in land develop - ment. The Association is also calling attention in other states to the special opportunities open to development. Every state Association has an important field here. At this time a leading railroad in Wiscon - sin is operating an exhibit train in Iowa, Illinois and Southern Wiscon - sin under the direction of the State Board of Agriculture. The State Potato Growers Association has spent about 1350.00 of its appropri - ation in connection with this tour. POTATO CLUBS AND SCHOOL CONTEST* At the Fifth Annual Convention held in November, ninety boxes of standard potatoes were given to school teachers who attended the special session devoted exclusively to potato club work. Many practical men in attendance at this session expressed the opinion that this was one of the most valuable acts of service the Association could render. These potatoes, with score cards and outlines for study were taken directly by these teachers back to the country schools and are now be - ing studied by the boys and girls in these schools. This work has only begun in Wisconsin. The mere mention of the above incident will suffice to show the unlimited amount of service open to a state Asso - ciation equipped to render services along this line. ANNUAL STATE CONVENTION AND STATE POTATO SHOW Wisconsin people have come to regard with enthusiasm the Annual Convention and State Potato Show. This event has been widely adver - tised in many sections of the country. Its success as a final round-up of a yeara's work is unquestioned. In twenty-six counties of the State a competitive effort has been made by hundreds of potato growers to se - cure the very best yields and to grow the very highest quality stock. </seg>
            <seg id="p172">I </seg>
            <seg id="p173">145 The regular classes of competitive exhibits at the Convention are ar - ranged with these development features in view. For example, the county booth exhibits are made distinctly com - mercial; a minimum exhibit of ten bushels and a maximum exhibit of fifteen bushels in established. Credit is given for the number of ex - hibitors showing. Credit is given for such phases of the exhibit as illustrate the desirable commercial standards recommended by the As- sociation. At the present time this phase of the Convention ha* grown to such an extent that during 1917 from twenty to twenty-live counties in Wisconsin will be competing for supremacy. It must be remembered that this competition is directed along commercial chan - nels and that the men engaged are not producers of novelties, but will iiding commercial potato growers of the State. A successful effort has been made to show potatoes in non-competi - tive exhibits exactly as they can be grown and handled for seed stock and also commercial table stock. The State Association should always keep in mind the ideal; but it should always also keep before the public the actual. The possibility of production under the desirable conditions of culture. In other words standards should not be set so high at to prohibit actual attainment under existing conditions. MARKETING PROBLEMS As Association as organized above does not buy or handle potatoes. In promoting such matters as market grades or legislation on this sub - ject, it becomes essential again to keep close to actual conditions. An example is here furnished. During a late blight, rot year thousands of bushels of rotten potatoes are thrown out of cars in the freight yards at Chicago. In some cases nearly whole cars are rejected. Photographs are made of these rotten potatoes and through the publicity channels of the country the whole thing is help up as a huge economic loss which, at least from the transportation view point, could have been avoided. Apparently eryone seems to agree to this. Two weeks previous, in the month of September, up in Barron County, Wisconsin, the potato crop is about ready for harvest. The crop has been partially killed by the late blight disease. Interest runs high as to the probable fate of the crop. The growers appeal for ad - vice. They are told by some not to wait until the vines are completely dead, but on the first opportunity to harvest and sell the crop before the disease seriously rots the tubers. They are advised that more or less of a gamble is involved. If they wait until a severe freeze kills the tops and clear, cool weather comes on, the crop may be harvested with apparent safety. If, however, the fall should prove continuously wet and frost should be deferred, a large part of the crop would rot in the </seg>
            <seg id="p174">146 NEBRASKA SEATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY ground. Damage from field frost must always be considered during late harvests. At large per centage of growers dependent upon this crop for liv - ing necessities decide to harvest while the stock is apparently sound. Then a gamble begins at another point. It the stock is moved quick - ly under fairly dry conditions, a large per centage reaches the shipper and consumer and is used. If harvested wet, slightly infected tubers will escape detection at the loading station and completely rot during transportation, it' unsatisfactory temperature conditions revail. A perplexing economic question is here raised, and in part answer - ed by the fact that it is impossible to anticipate and often impossible to detect the conditoins causing serious losses on the market. State Associations will be called upon co-operation with marketing and shipping interests to work in the interest of establishing grading and sorting regulations. Such questions will require the sound judg - ment of successful growers, dealers and shippers. The above statements show thai an Association supported State Government can enlist the endorsement and support of ever mercial and educational and organied agency affiliated with the try. The Annual Convention and State show will beeoir climax of a year's work in the fi velopment may be demonstrated. Id, in which actu It is apparent now in Ameri M to the irrigated districts of the west have peculiar advant petition will be a life giving factor. It is hoped that the statements made here along developmeu lines in Wisconsin, by general application to other states, may be In cordance with the country wide movement in the interests of the pot industry. Wisconsin has just completed the third year's experience of a plan of seed potato inspection and certification. The plan as adopted is a voluntary agreement between the potato growers and the Wisconsin Experiment station. Seed potato inspection and certification in Wiscon - son is not regulated by any special state law on the subject. A fee is charged calculated to cover the expense of doing the work and this fee is regulated according to the acreage inspected. The work has been undertaken largely In connection with the po - tato development work of the state. Experience has shown that the men who have been affiliated for several years with potato improve - ment work under the direction of the Experiment Station, are the men who are now best equipped to carry on this work successfully.

            <seg id="p175">DETAILS OF OPERATING THE PLAN 147 g. are now equipped or prepared to give the attention to the work jcessary to success. DETAILS OF OPERATING THE PLAN jnimer Inspection: An examination of the standards as adopted that very many important determinations must be made during be growing season. Important among these determinations are in - ipection relative to variety purity, freedom from vine diseases, stand, ind general cultural conditions.' The summer inspection begins just bout the time the vines come into flower, as this is the period wben ariety distinctions can best be determined. The first inspection last intil about September 5, as it is very important that all early records red before frost damages the vines. The inspector goes over the field carefully in the presence of the iwner, as it is usually necessary to give instructions upon the ob - ervance of which the issuance of a certificate will be based. Before certificate is issued, the applicant signs a statement that such in - ructions have been carried out. These instructions refer especially he removal of mixtures, sorting and diseased vines. Second Inspection: The second inspection of the stock is made Iter the harvest, as a rule when the stock is in the storage bin. In any cases the inspector is enabled to see part of the stock as It Is be- ns harvested on the field. At this second inspection records taken at he first inspection are checked up. Records are taken relative to uber diseases, size and quality standards. Particular attention is here called to the fact that these records re kept as simple as possible and only significant conditions are re .1 The common conditions upon which a report is made at this nspection are late blight rot, common scab, black scurf, and size and ype satndards. and quality standards. Experience has shown that it is impossible to formulate a method of procedure adaptable to all cases. Abundant opportunity is open to the inspector to use careful judgment and discretion over matters which cannot be anticipated. Certain conditions would cause re - jections on one farm which might be tolerated or passed after correc - tion on another. Attention is called particularly also to the facts that it ia ad - visable to have one inspector make both inspections on the same farm, and thus far in Wisconsin it has been possible to have one man do nearly all the inspection work. This plan is preferred rather than to delegate the work to local secretaries or to the local officials. In Wis - consin the entire work is centralized in the Horticultural Department, Wisconsin, Experiment station. As an illustration of the percentage of applicants who received </seg>
            <seg id="p176">148 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY certificates and also of the causes for rejections, the following table is submitted on the season of 1916. DEVELOPMENT OP WISCONSIN PURE SEED POTATO INDUSTRY Many sections of the country are looking to the northern states for the production of healthy seed stock of standard varieties. Wis - consin growers are especially interested in the production of seed stock in car lots to supply this demand. At present in Wisconsin the following varieties are being grown for this special demand. The Rural New Yorker, Green Mountani, Burbank and Peerless I Pearl) for late; the Triumph, Early Ohio, and Irish Cobbler for early. There is abundant opportunity to improve the average of car seed ship - ments now being sent out from Wisconsin and the seed certification plan here referred to has called special attention to the need of this development. The amount of certified seed of this kind will gradually increase each year. The attention of the seed potato buying centers of the county is now being called to this phase of the work. INTER-OOUNTY EXCHANGE OF PURE SEED STOCK Potato development work has now been organized in about twenty - six counties in Wisconsin. As this work progresses it is necessary to secure seed stock from time to time to ship from one county to another. It is very important that an adaptable variety be sei ured. Through the development of several seed specialists in Wisconsin, an available supply of the right kind of seed stock has now been secured. The County Agricultural representatives are so-operating very closely with their potato growers in this development work. In fact, community potato development work is now one of the most important phases of the improvement in Wisconsin. Official seed potato certifications fits in admirably with the plan of community potato work adaptable to each region.

            <seg id="p177">149 on the average Wisconsin potato (arm. This work also has its appli - cation to the interest which has been aroused in better cultural meth - ods. The inspector through his regular work has been able to reach a large number of men in each community who have not applied for certification. He has been able to conduct several field meetings and to assist in potato spraying demonstrations, etc. Many men in each community who have not had their fields inspected have secured their start in pure seed work or in better methods ot cultivation through the influence of the inspector in the regular performance of his duties. The inspector also co-operates very closely with the county agricul - tural representative and as a rule the County Agricultural represen - tative accompanies the inspector on his trip. In closing, attention is called to the necessity of keeping this work consistent with the actual conditions as they are found in the field and also consistent with the possibilities of production under desirable con - ditions of culture. In Wisconsin careful attention has been given to adopt standards that can be reached under field conditions in the state. It has been necessary false impressions relative to the standard of cer - tified seed potatoes. It is found on the one hand, and on the other hand it is found that in many seed potato markets too high a stand - ard is expected. In the direction of the work, therefore, both these elements must be taken into consideration. A conclusive test of the value of this work is found in the fact the average of certified seed stock in type, quality, and yield is superior to the general run of seed stock planted in the state. Discussion Mr. Keyser: Do the growers there have a commercial organiza- tic Mr. Milward: No, except in this way. We have now develpped in Wisconsin, certain local association, Forest County for instance has a local association, and Wahpacca County has. There is just as certain distance that we can go along those directions. With that line of development work we are on the right track, and those local men who do form local associations are helping out, although the work is just in the beginning. Mr. Williams: I would like to ask in regard to encouraging the yield per acre. I noitce that in your earlier remarks yon spoke of offering premiums? Now it has been a sort of a hobby of mine that we should encourage that yield per acre, the large yield per acre, by offering premiums through our Counyr or State organizations for the largest yield per acre. I have been trying to get our County Board to offer that, and in all probability that will come Into operation this coming season. I would like *o ask if you have done anything along </seg>
            <seg id="p178">150 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL. SOCIETY that line in your state, offering a liberal premium for the best acreage yield? Mr. Mil ward: There has been no premiums ottered although we have had that matter up for consideration, but we have not done any - thing along that line, for the reason that we have had so many irons in the fire, and we have not been able to look after it. The thing that we have been up against, is watching that thing from the field stand - point. I think we are going to come to that in the future. There are several of our men, who are working along that line. In our state development work now we have a few specialists who are making it a poit to develope along that line. We are developing our state in - dustry in Wisconsin, and we have certain problems. We take the premium money for the seed, and divide it according to the class of seed we are raising. Dr. Wilcox: Perhaps Mr. Milward would feel somewhat better it we would show substantial appreciation of his suggestions by in - dicating that we do not take years down here to learn. Therefore I am going to move that the chairman appoint a committee of I would think five men to proceed and organize as soon as possible the "Nebraska Po - tato Grower's Association.'' Mr. Duncan: I would like to second Dr. Wilcox's motion. I be lieve that is a good move, and that it is started in the right direction The President: I have been impressed with two or three points particularly that Mr. Milward has brought out. It seems to me that the suggestion that Mr. Milward leaves with us of organization, and the possibilities of organization are good ones, if no other reason than to standardize our products, and advertise our product, and to go not only into the different sections of the state that grow potatoes ex - tensively, but you will be able to get more state and United States aid, and you would be able to help yourselves more than you are now doing, and it seems to me, that this motion made by Doctor Wilcox is a good The question put and carried. The President: I will send a letter to the Individuals who will be appointed on this committee within the next ten days. Mr. Dickinson: I believe that is one of the things that Nebraska needs, is something for the betterment for Nebraska potatoes. One of the great troubles with Nebraska potatoes is that they plant them over and over too many times, and the seed runs out. You know we get seed from the north, and it makes quite an expensive seed when we come to ship it from the north and get it into this section, and of course that is one of the great reasons they do not change their seed oftener, but I think if this state had an organiza - tion that would impress upon the potato growers of the state of Ne - braska, the great importance of changing the seed, and rotating their </seg>
            <seg id="p179">151 crops, I think it would be one of the great benefits to the potato grow - ing in the state of Nebraska. We must take into consideration the Triumph potato they grow in Texas, that we have Just commenced to grow it in Nebraska, and it has not developed here. In northwestern Nebraska we can grow seed that is just as good to raise potatoes in the state of Texas as they can grow in Minnesota, and I think we can grow them better really. The Triumph is suitable to northwestern Nebraska, and I think better suitable for Minnesota. I think we can grow a bet - ter potato in northwestern Nebraska, then they can in Minnesota. It yields more and it is more profitable. I think with a state organiza - tion that educates the people of the state of Nebraska is a great work. It is a wonderful work in this state, and it will improve the potato business, and I must say that the growing of potatoes, and the mar - keting of potatoes, or the growing of any product and the market - ing of it are two separate ideas, and I would endorse the Wisconsin idea entirely. The man who is growing potatoes has not the time to put to the marketing problem. They are two separate and defined parts. There is one feature of the potato business in Nebraska. There are only a few varieties that are good varieties for the state to grow. I think that the Ohio, for the Sheridan County District and the Triumph are virtually the two varieties that would be suitable for that section. Then you take it over in the irrigated district, and they have the Pearl, and the Rural New Yorker. There are only two or three commercial varieties in the state that are worth while, we have hundreds of differ - ent varieties, but there are only a few that are adoptable. The Chairman: There is a motion before the house, that the hainnan appoint a committee of five to investigate the feasibility of starting a movement that will result in the organization of the potatoes growers of Nebraska. Mr. Williams: It seems to me that the most effective work that ould be carried on. could be done under what you might call, local r county organizations. Here we have with us a County Agent, and those agents would be the ideal way to get a County organization It seems to me, and therefore I question the advisability of handling this through the state organization until you get the local organizations organized. Mr. Mil ward: Not for a moment would I start with the local or - ganization. We have a strong central state organization. I will tell you, you want a well organized vigorous advertising publicity, and de - veloping agency, centralized in some one place to have supervision over section of the state. I think that is the place to begin, and that has been the experience of our state. Commercial associations and local association may come later, but I think it has been the experience of </seg>
            <seg id="p180">152 other states, that the strong centralized state organization is the thing where you get results from first. The Chairman: I think the idea you had Mr. Williams would be borne out. Undoubtedly the work in the different counties would be actively taken up through the state organization by the agents in those different counties. Mr. Siedell: I wish to endorse practically everything that Mr. Milward has said, especially about the state organization. The idea that is quite prominent among the potato growers in northwestern Ne - braska has been the commercial organization, rather than the edu - cational organization, and I believe the way to get after the educa - tional organization is through the state organization. We who are in the work, we hardly feel our potato workers are ready to take up com - mercial organization at the present time. That is, they have hardly standardized their potatoes to the point where they could do that. There are many things that men in organization work fail to consider. It could be illustrated by saying that an efficient manager In all that northwestern country has improved the potato through the organiza - tion, than a commercial organization might be formed at that time, but I am very much in favor of an association like conducted in Wiscon- sin. Mr. Davis: I believe the time is ripe for a local organization in our town. But I am in favor of having a state organization also, and one that would act as a head to all the institutions that might be formed locally. Mr. Holland: It seems to me there would be a special advantage in having a local organization of potato growers. I feel also though that the state organization should come first, and perhaps the local or the community organization should come later, but that in organizing now they would be in a position to a much better advantage commer - cially later. Mr. Siedell: I have devoted considerable time to the survey and study of these organizations, or those that thought they wanted to have organizations, and I have borne out from the Representative from Office to Market, that without a state organization preceeding, we know of no single case in which a potato grower's association as a com - mercial organization has been successful anywhere in the United States. That is not a discouragement however, and while I feel many have died because they were not in a position, or that their state did not have an improved article on which to commercialize. Mr. Dickinson: I think that the state organization should come first, for this reason. In order to have a commercial organization to succeed, that commercial organization must work under certain lines. It must have established ideas and rules, and graded and when you do not have your potatoes grown and graded and people that are growing </seg>

(Reads as follows) RESOLUTION Mr. Siedell: I move that the motion be adopted as read. Carried. Session closed. Pursuant to the motion as adopted the following communication announcing the appointment of a committee to discuss the feasibility of organizing a State Potato Growers Association was sent to the men appointed. Dear Sir: Nebraska's potato industry was one of the chief topics for discus - sion at the recent annual meetings of the State Horticultural Society. At one of these meetings, J. G. Milward, secretary of the Wisconsin Potato Growers Association, outlined the work as carried on by their organization. A discussion followed his address relative to forming a Nebraska Potato Growers' Association. More than 100 growers were in attendance, and the prevailing opinion seemed to be in favor of some sort of an organization. The chairman was authorized to appoint a committee and instruct it to investigate the attitude of the growers upon this subject. In selecting this committee an attempt has been made to include one suc - cessful and influential grower, as well as the county agent from each of the following counties: Box Butte, Sheridan, Kimball, and Dawes. The committee will be called together sometime next spring, per - haps at Alliance, to decide whether or not an association will be form- </seg>

Wilcox, Pathologist, Lincoln, Nebr. A. E. Anderson, Extension Service, Lincoln, Nebr. R. F. Howard. Dept. of Hort., Lincoln, Nebr. Very truly R. F. HOWARD, President Nebraska State Horticultural Society THE POTATO INDUSTRY OF WESTERN NEBRASKA B;R F .Howard, Department of Horticulture University of Nebraska Western Nebraska has developed its potato industry to such an extent the past few years that it may now be rated as one of the im - portant commercial potato producing centers of the United States. Approximately fourteen million bushels of potatoes were raised in Ne - braska in 1917. Over one-half of this crop was produced in Sheridan. Box Butte, Dawes, Scotts Bluff, and Kimball counties. The possibilities for growing potatoes in these counties are pe - culiarly favorable and almost unlimited. The potato prefers a soil of loose texture, provided it has sufficient plant food for proper develop - ment. Fifty or sixty thousand acres are now being devoted to potato growing in these counties. This is only a fractional part of the land in this area that may be devoted to potato culture. The relatively short growing season and the cool nights aid in asking this region well adapted to potato production. Considering present land values in this commercial potato section, together with the average gross income from potatoes for the past five years, the statement may be made that potato growing in western Nebraska constitutes one of the most profit - able agricultural enterprises in the State. Cultural Methods The land in this potato section is admirably adapted to the use of labor saving machinery, such as the gang plow, potato planter and digger. One can till a larger area there than under conditions as they </seg>
            <seg id="p184">155 exist in eastern Nebraska. The labor cost of tilling an acre is probably somewhat less than it is in other sections. After the native sod has been subdued, potato culture in this sec - tion under dry land conditions consists chiefly in plowing the land, firming to conserve the moisture, planting, one harrowing, and from two to four cultivations. This amount of labor will leave the pota - toes relatively free from weeds. From two to four application* of water and a corresponding number of cultivations are necessary when growing potatoes under irrigation. This makes the labor cost some - what greater than it is under dry land culture, tho the gross income is usually from two to three times as great also. While many of the diseases common to the potato in most of the large growing centers are to be found in Western Nebraska, this sec - tion is almost wholly free from some of the most serious ones. The growers here do not have to contend with the early and late blight, diseases which, when present, require several applications of spray material for their control. The potato beetle, which is one of the most injurious insect pests of the potato crop, is not present in sufficient quanities to justify commercial growers in western Nebraska to spray for it scontrol. Methods of Marketing The methods now used in placing Nebraska's large potato crop upon the market are peculiar to Nebraska. In many respects these methods could be changed to advantage to the individual growers and to the industry itself. It must be said that very little attention is paid to sorting and grading on the farm. While some growers grade their potatoes in the field and handle them in sacks or crates, the ma - jority do not. Most of the potatoes are hauled in bulk "field run' 1 to the shipping point where they may be "run over" a screen by the man who buys them. This process at best only culls out the potatoes too small for market. It aids little in eliminating the bruised, diseased, and frozen tubers. Potato "dealers" from various parts of the country are attracted to western Nebraska just before or at harvest time. There are differ - ent types of potato buyers. Some of them represent large wholesale houses. Others represent southern dealers who are after the choice stock for seed purposes. Others buy Independently, expecting to move their cars to advantageous points for Immediate sale. There la an inducement for the individual grower to take to market everything he can so long as he gets the prevailing price for his product. This, of course, has a tendency to lower the price paid by buyers somewhat below the prevailing price of merchantable potatoes. It also results usually in the man with good potatoes getting less than the true worth of his crop because too much discrimination in price on the part of </seg>

It is not surprising that this condition of affairs exists when one considers that the industry is now, that it has had an enormous growth, and that the growers have received handsome returns from their in - vestment despite the fact that Nebraska potatoes are usually sold at a discount on practically all of the larger markets. When land values in this potato section are finally adjusted so that the average in - come from potatoes is only a reasonable rate of interest on the invest - ment, a point will have been reached where the grower who uses good seed, good cultural methods, and markets a well graded product will succeed where others will not. Under present conditions the grower who uses good methods makes a greater net profit than the grower who does not. However, so long as a large proportion of the growers who do not pay attention to disease control, good seed, and a uniform product, are able to make a profit, the potato crop as a whole from this state will continue to be sold on other markets at a discount. The car shortage is partially responsible for the methods now used by the growers in disposing of their crops at the shipping points. In most cases it is impossible for the grower to get a car when he wants it. It is difficult also for the grower who is compelled to haul his po- tatoes several miles to load a car in the brief period of tin: the railroads. Nebraska's Seed Opportunities In the opinion of the writer Nebraska has an opportunity to be - come one of the leading states so far as the production of seed potatoes is concerned. At present a certain portion of the Early Triumph variety, grown in this state, is being used in Texas for seed purposes. No systematic attempt, however, has been made to cater to the seed trade of the south as a means of disposing of a large portion of our crop. In a recent letter from the Dean of the Agricultural School of Texas, he says: "For a number of years the Irish potato growers of Texas have been buying about 90 per cent of their seed potatoes from Maine and Minnesota. It seems to me that potatoes, especially those grown without irrigation in central and western states, ought to give just as good results as those from the two states above mentioned." When one considers hat the state of Texas alone uses about 400 car - loads of potatoes for seed each year, it becomes apparent that if Wes - tern Nebraska could secure this trade a permanent market could be established for a large part of our output. According to Government reports the states of Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas use each year over two and one-half million bushels of po - tatoes for seed. The Market Requirements for Seed Potatoes It is common knowledge that potatoes grown under northern con - ditions the previous year are better for seed in the southern and cen- </seg>

            <seg id="p187">MARKETING REQUIREMENTS FOR SEED POTATOES l'&gt;~ tral states than stock that has been produced locally. This is so generally recognized that potato dealers thruout central and southern states adverise "northern grown" or "Red River" potatoes in the spring for seed purposes. The Red River Valley in Minnesota has established a wide reputation for its seed potatoes. Other sections, notably in Maine, Wisconsin, and Michigan, have also developed their seed trade to such an extent that a high precent of the crop from these sections is sold for seed purposes. The Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station has been con - ducting some experiments with a view of determining the value of northern grown potatoes for seed in eastern Nebraska. It has been comparing the yielding qualities of potatoes produced in Minnesota and Wisconsin with stock grown the previous year in eastern Nebras - ka. Comparisons have also been made with potatoes grown the pre - vious season in western Nebraska. The results of over twenty tests, extending over a period of ten years, show that approximately 25 per cent higher yield may be expected from northern seed or western Ne - braska seed than one may expect to get if he uses potatoes that hare been grown in the eastern part of the state. There is one exception to the above statement. It has been found that potatoes produced in eastern Nebraska under a straw or litter mulch will, if used as seed the following year, yield almost as heavy as seed imported from the north or from western Nebraska. The difference that has been found to exist in eastern Nebraska between northern grown, western Nebraska grown, and home grown seed is probably true to an equal extent in Missouri and Kansas, and to even a greater extent in all of the south- rn states Since western Nebraska has soil and climatic conditions particular - ly favorable for producing potatoes that are valuable for seed in the south, why not promote the seed industry in every way possible? Ar - rangements are now being made with the Agricultural Colleges of some of the central and southern states -whereby they may have an oppor - tunity of testing seed produced in this state with the seed they ordin - arily use. When these states become fully aware that our potatoes ar* valuable as seed stock, we will probably have an opportunity to estab - lish an outlet for a large per cent of our potatoes. When this oppor - tunity presents itself we should be in a position to avail ourselves of it. This can be done only by having a product that will meet their demands. Potatoes that have been merely grown in a region with a reputation for its possibilities of growing seed will not win and hold a seed trade. We must be in a position to fulfill other requirements to win and hold the seed trade of the south. We must grow the varieties they demand. We must present to the trade a uniform grade typical of those varieties, and we must present a product relatively free from disease. </seg>
            <seg id="p188">158 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Organization Xeceesary Assuming that 25 per cent of the potato growers in western Ne - braska would fulfill the requirements set by the southern seed trade, there would still remain the very difficult problem of putting these individual growers in touch with men wanting their crop. If they act as individuals, it would be necessary" in most cases, as it is now, for representatives to come hundreds of miles and look over the entire field in order to find potatoes suited to their needs. These buyers would constantly have to- guard against unreliable goods. This would be an awkward and expensive system, and would not be conducive to building the seed reputation for us. Wisconsin and other seed produc - ing states soon found, after they had demonstrated that they could grow good seed potatoes, that it was to their advantage to have a re - sponsible organization. Instead of acting as individuals the growers allow the organization to be responsible. It is not necessary to have a cooperative buying and selling body in order to secure many of the benefits derived from organization. One of the chief functions of Borne potato organizations is to see that some properly qualified and authorized person inspects all potatoes of the organization and lists the growers having potatoes suitable for seed purposes. This list is put into the hands of buyers, making it possible for them to deal di - rectly with the grower. Within the past few months chance inquiries have come to the writer's attention which would have enabled him to have placed 15 or 20 carloads of potatoes for seed purposes had he been able to have made the statement that the pota spected by a responsible person. Realizing the need of a potato organization in Nebraska, .--veral prominent growers met in Alliance, January, 1917, and perfected an organization to be known as The Nebraska Potato Improvement As - sociation. This association has been organized primarily to promote the potato industry in Nebraska, to bring together all agencies inter - ested in the production, transportation, distribution, and utilization of potatoes. This association will lend its influence in improving and disseminating the best strains of seed potaties. It will probably later encourage a system of pure seed certification thru field and storage house inspection. </seg>

The family garden can be grown in the orchard and furnish a liberal supply of all kinds of vegetables for summer and winter use. In those portions of the state where rainfall is sufficient or irriga - tion is practiced and small fruits thrive enough strawberries, rasp - berries, gooseberries and currants can be grown between the tree* to supply the family needs and in favorable seasons have a surplus for market. Corn (either sweet corn or any field variety) is one of the best rops to grow in the young orchard. We must cultivate the vegetables, small fruits or corn and in so Joins we are cultivating the trees. An example of intercropping is cited that has come to our notice and shows what can be done along this line. One orchard in Cass county has been cropped to corn as above advocated. The rows of trees are 33 feet apart and at the seventh year the owner was still raising five rows of corn in each of the strips between the rows of trees. This little orchard of 150 trees which occupied about 4 acres of land produced in 1911 the seventh year from planting 200 bushels of Jonathan and Gano apples and 80 bushels of corn. CAUTION: We must not forget that we are growing an orchard and the crops grown between the trees are to utilize the land until the trees are large enough to tae the entire area. Be careful in planting the crop in the young orchard to allow ample space along the rows of trees so that they may be carefully cultivated and yet not be injured by having limbs or bark on the trunk broken by cultivator or horses.
