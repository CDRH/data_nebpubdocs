            <seg id="p006">Historical The Labor Department of Nebraska was created in 1887 as the Bureau of Labor Census and Industrial Statistics. The duties of the Commissioner consisted mainly of collecting and publishing industrial statistics, examining relations between labor and capital, means of escape from fire, the financial conditions, cost of food, fuel, clothing, etc. Assessors were required to report to the Bureau of Labor the name and occupation of all persons over 21 years of age in their respective townships or precincts. Thus for many years the Bureau functioned primarily and almost solely as a gatherer and disseminator of statistics. However, in 1917 the administration of the Workmen's Compensation Law was vested in the Bureau, and since that time it has taken its place as one of the most important departmental agencies of the state government. A Deputy Commissioner of Labor appointed by the governor, administered the affairs of the Bureau of Labor until 1919, when the Department of Labor was created under the Civil Administrative Code Law, and the title of Secretary of Labor conferred upon its chief official. The names of the heads of the de - partment and the years of their service are as follows: John Jenkins 1887-1888 John Jenkins „ _ 1889-1890 Phillip Andres 1891-1892 J. B. Erion...- 1893-1894 J. H.

            <seg id="p007">STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR 7 Labor's First Real Recognition In 1919 the then "Bureau of Labor Census and Industrial Statistics" was re-classified by the Governor. Under the Administrative system what had formerly always been a minor bureau was raised to the level of the agricultural, public works, trade and commerce, and other administrative agencies of our state government. The legisla - ture of that year appropriated sufficient funds so that the newly created Department of Labor might function as it should. The Secretary of Labor and his assistants did not reorganize the Department at that time — they organized it. And for more than four years thereafter the labor laws, and particularly the Workmen's Compensation Law, were carefully, honestly and justly enforced, for the benefit alike of the employer and his employees. Attempt to Wreck in 1923 During the administration of two years ago the Department was all but wrecked. The keeping of permanent records of industrial accidents and periodical payments of compensation, the maintaining of a live and up-to-date file of employers and their respective in - surance carriers, and other activities essential to a proper and busi - ness-like administration of the affairs of the Department, were en - tirely abandoned. The daily mail of the Department was allowed :o accumulate for months at a time, unopened and unanswered. A flood of "bargain lump-sum settlements" were put through by trained insurance adjusters, and were approved by the so-called acting Compensation Commissioner after a superficial inspection of them. In 469 working days during that period the "one-man" Labor Depart - ment "heard" 587 contested compensation cases, "read, carefully con - sidered and approved" 292 lump sum settlements, in addition to "in - vestigating" the fires of the state. No other administration of Nebraska ever attempted to so ruth - lessly and knowingly deprive the unfortunate widows, orphans and injured bread-winners of the state of their only means of existence, as was done during the years of 1923 and 1924. Restored by Present Governor But, in 1925, under the administration of Governor Adam McMullen, the Labor Department was again rehabilitated. The legislature was requested to, and did, appropriate funds to re-establish the Depart - ment. An adequate office force was provided in the main office at Lincoln and the activities of the Omaha branch were restored with an assistant to the Commissioner in charge. The first act of the Compensation Commissioner was to discon- tinue the pernicious practice of "bargain settlements." The gathering </seg>
            <seg id="p008">8 TWENTIETH BIENNIAL REPORT and filing of the permanent records was renewed. The correspond - ence was kept up to the minute, and the affairs of the Department were restored as rapidly as possible to their former efficient condition. The contested cases were heard with patience, and sufficient time was taken by the Commissioner and his assistants, to carefully review the evidence in each case before arriving at a decision. The beneficent provisions of the Workmen's Compensation Law apply daily to perhaps more citizens of our state than do those of any other law upon our statute books; its administration affects the wel - fare of more of our families and homes. And yet the scope of its activities is known to less people than is that of almost any other branch of our state government. Increased Activities in 1925 The employers and employes in the state — approximately a quar - ter of a million of them — have very little idea as to what the ad - ministration of this law accomplishes annually. During the year 1925 there were 17,074 industrial accidents in Nebraska reported to this Department. Of this total, 356 claims were contested by em - ployers and insurance companies, and formal hearings had before the Commissioner or one of his assistants. In the remaining 16,718 cases the insurance company (or the employer if he carries his own in - surance) paid all the medical and hospital expenses, and the com - pensation to the injured worker or his dependents when due, all without a dispute. Every working day in the year 1925, fifty-five workingmen and women were injured in this state. Automatically, almost, this law at once steps in with medical, surgical and hospital care for the injured. In addition it furnishes a sort of "grub-stake'' until these injured are able to return to work. The employer may rest assured that these unfortunate thousands who annually drop back into their places in industry do not have the crushing worry of doctor and hospital expenses, back rent and gro - cery bills hanging over their heads. But nevertheless this happy condition is alone worth to the employer many times the cost of this insurance in the contentment, morale and added efficiency of his whole organization. Former Governor's Actions Unrebuked That a governor of Nebraska would publicly attempt to even hamper the workings of the Department as was done in 1923 and 1924, to say nothing of well nigh completely wrecking it, without a protest being voiced from any one of the more than 133,000 men and women who have met with industrial accidents in this state in the last eleven years, is unthinkable, and can be accounted for only by the fact that the circumstances have never been brought to their attention. </seg>
            <seg id="p009">STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR 9 Investigation Recommended We would therefore recommend that the next session of the legis - lature be requested to appoint a committe to investigate the condi - tions that existed in this Department during the preceding adminis - tration and report its findings to the legislature and the Governor. Such an investigation and report would be of great and lasting bene - fit alike to the employers and employes in Nebraska. It would demonstrate to the satisfaction of any employer the fact that under the "false economy" plea of saving a few paltry cents in his state taxes, his injured employes were deprived of hundreds and thou - sands of dollars to which they were justly and lawfully entitled. It would further show to the employer that in spite of the fact that these sums were unlawfully withheld from injured employes, his com - pensation insurance premiums were steadily and consistently in - creased. The employer derived no material benefit from this woeful lack of administration, and certainly the injustice done the injured em - ployes during 1923 and 1924 is without any justification whatever. The answer to the question, who reaped the harvest, is at once obvious. </seg>
            <seg id="p010">department had been clarified by the cases submitted to the Supreme Court for interpretation. The total number of accidents reported to the department during the year 1925 was 17,074 — the highest in the history of the law. The amount paid injured workers in compensation was $623,042.77 and the medical and hospital expense was $319,806.63. This is the great - est volume of business transacted by the department in any one year since the law was enacted. The department should have a factory inspector to follow up the insurance company inspector's reports to the department which give definite information as to the location of hazardous machinery in the state. To correct the accident hazard in industry would reduce the number &lt;&gt;f accidents in the state and be a real service to the employer and employe. Eleven Years' Activities The following table shows the number of accidents, medical and hospital expense and the amount of compensation paid to injured workers each year from 1915 to 1925, inclusive; as reported to the Compensation Commissioner. It is well that the reader bear in mind that these totals include not alone the money paid out by insurance companies, but also that paid by those large employers who have elected to carry their own insurance: Number of Accidents Medical &amp; Hospital Total Losses Reported to Compensation Compensation Commission'r : i 4,082 |25,422.89 1 10,822 49,118.87 L... 13,293 51,827.22 1 7,066 39,231.99 1 11,273 90,162.14 I 13,676 137,432.14 11,356 138,736.99 ! 13,932 181,231.56 L 16,192 175,058.10 I 15,035 252,466.34 I 17 074 319 8f&gt;fifiS $24,923.62 $50,346.51 76,143.50 125,262.37 101,204.51 153,031.73 102,540.48 141,772.47 255,313.36 345,476.24 402,780.94 540,213.08 481,596.18 620,333.17 526,715.46 707,947.02 407,645.55 582,703.65 466,755.29 719,221.63 K9.3 I\A9. 77 QA9.

            <seg id="p011">STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR 11 Employers Need This Service The recent bankruptcy of a mutual insurance company that had for years written a large volume of compensation insurance in Ne - braska brings to the attention of this Department the urgent need for a service not at this time available to employers. Immediately after this regrettable occurrence the Department was requested by numerous employers who had carried insurance witk the bankrupt company to furnish to them the number of their accidents and the total amount expended for compensation and med - ical expenses covering various periods of time. This information was, of course, desired in the thought that they might secure a premium rating of less than the standard for their particular class. And no doubt many of these employers were entitled to some reduction in their premium on the basis of their past experience. This Department was established and is maintained primarily for the benefit of the employer and his employes. But it comes in direct contact with hundreds, yes, even thousands of employes, where - as the employers who have dealings with the Department are rep - resented by a mere handful. Therefore, all of the information is filed and indexed in the name of the injured employe, and our im - proved tabulating system makes this information available at a mo - ment's notice. BUT, with the equipment and facilities at our disposal it is a physical impossibility to furnish the employer with this informa - tion that he should have at least annually. However, by the ex - penditure of a small sum of money for an additional supply of cards and the employment of another filing clerk, these accident report cards could be cross-filed, and indexed in the name of the employer, so that at any time any employer could ascertain the number of his accidents, the amount paid his injured employes as compensation, and the amount expended for hospital and medical expenses by his insurance carrier. The present appropriation, though, would not justify even the purchase of the cards, to say nothing of the added clerical help. We venture the assertion that not one employer in this state would even think of buying any other service where such an ex - penditure was involved, without at least some information as to what he was getting for his money. Is not this suggestion worthy of some consideration by the em - ployers of Nebraska, who spent $1,330,031.00 for compensation in - surance in 1925? Would not the value of this service to the employer be worth tyi jitiv tnvipft t"ViP Twwninfli cost of SGCUXinCT it *^ If properly presented to the next session of the legislature </seg>
            <seg id="p012">12 TWENTIETH BIENNIAL REPORT by the persons most vitally interested, do you not believe little dif- ficulty would be encountered in securing adequate appropriation for this service? In your opinion would this not be the quickest, surest and most businesslike method of determining whether or not the burdensome premiums collected for compensation insurance from Nebraska em- ployers are justified ? Fair Margin of Profit For the information of the employers of the state we print below a table showing the premiums collected and losses paid by the various compensation insurance companies since the law become effective in 1915, as reported to the Insurance Department of the state: Premiums Collected Losses Paid Gross Profits 1915 $243,072.00 $78,085.00 $164,987.00 1916 262,910.00 144,037.00 118,873.00 1917 428,811.00 186,261.00 242,550.00 1918 545,984.00 205,068.00 340,916.00 1919 913,003.00 307,438.00 605,565.00 1920 1,181,785.00 472,684.00 709,101.00 1921 1,052,231.00 568,978.00 483,253.00 1922 758,677.00 547,129.00 211,548.00 1923 824,514.00 657,676.00 166,838.00 1924 1,154,172.00 755,486.00 398,686.00 1925 1,330,031.00 877,850.00 452,181.00 11 years 8,695,190.00 4,800,692.00 3,894,498.00 Percentage of Gross Profits 44.8% Mr. Employer, do you know what percentage . of the premium collected from you and reported in the above table was returned to your employes in medical and hospital expenses and compensation? </seg>
            <seg id="p013">STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR 13 Statistical Report More accidents were reported to the Commission in 1925 than in any previous year. This is, of course, largely attributable to the natural and normal growth of the business of the Department. In addition, as the beneficent provisions of the law become more widely known, it is inevitable that more and more injured workmen will inquire regarding their rights under the law. In spite of the great volume of publicity that has been given to the compensation law since 1919, there are still thousands of industrial workers in Nebraska today who are ignorant of even the existence of such a law. This army of uninformed is being augmented annually by the myriads of boys and girls who are turned out of our public schools and are re- cruited into industry without any knowledge of the law. The following table presents in a concise form the activities of the Commission for 1925. Succeeding pages of this report deal with various phases of those activities more in detail. Accidents Reported 17,074 Compensation Paid $623,042.77 Medical and Hospital Expenses 319,806.63 Total $942,849.40 Petitions for Hearing Filed 346 Cases Formally Heard 356 Awards Entered 227 Cases Dismissed. 129 Appeals to District Court 83 Commissioner Sustained 48 Commissioner Reversed _ 12 Pending 23 Appeals to Supreme Court 16 Commissioner Sustained 6 Commissioner Reversed 4 Pending 6 Lump Sum Settlements Approved. 62 Total Amount Involved $104,110.34 Fatal Cases Reported ■ 34 i </seg>
            <seg id="p014">14 TWENTIETH BIENNIAL REPORT An Interesting Table Fifty-one insurance companies wrote compensation insurance &lt;n Nebraska in 1925. They reported to the Insurance Commissioner an aggregate of premiums collected during the year amounting to $1, - 330,031.91, while the total losses reported to the Insurance Commis - sioner by them amounted to $877,850.08. The discrepancy between the losses reported to the Insurance Commissioner and those reported to the Compensation Commissioner can only be accounted for by the fact that the companies failed to report the same to this Department, as every penny reported is included in this table. An analysis of the figures contained in this report will no doubt be of interest to many readers. </seg>

There is a marked contrast between the number of accidents actually reported to the Commissioner by these self insurers during the year 1925 and the number occurring as sworn to by some of these employers in applying for a renewal of their permit for 1926. The Commissioner shall expect this discrepancy to be explained satisfactorily, and permits will not be granted during the year 1927 unless the sworn statement corresponds with the actual reports received during 1926.

            <seg id="p019">STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR 19 Medical and Hospital Expenses During the year 1925 the Department made a conscientious effort to reduce the medical and hospital expenses. This was the most trying and the least satisfying of any of our duties. A large num - ber of apparently excessive doctor and hospital bills was submitted to the department by various insurance companies. It was necessary to review these bills in the evenings, because of the impossibility to concentrate our minds on this work during the day time on account of the many interruptions. We adjusted those bills that in our opinion were unreasonably excessive in the hope that the employers would receive at least a slight reduction in their compensation insurance premiums. At the end Of the year we learned that the insurance companies had pocketed the money saved for them by our effort, but in not a single instance did we hear of an employer receiving a reduction in his premium. On the contrary we are reliably informed that premiums were ad - vanced in 1926 — and the end is not yet. Evil of Lump-Sum Settlements Lump sum settlements are the bane of the Commissioner. In a great many cases they are very much desired by the injured em - ploye or the dependents of an employe who has met with a fatal accident. But in very very few of these instances is it advisable that such settlements be made. The Nebraska law provides that the Com - missioner's approval is a requisite to lump sum settlements and hardly a day passes in which he does not withhold his approval from one or more proposed settlements. The only reasons for such action is that the practice ia against public policy and rarely for the best interests of injured workers and their dependents. An opinion handed down by F. A. Duxbury of the Minnesota Industrial Commission so truly reflects the sentiments of the Nebraska Commissioner that we herewith reprint it in its entirety. In the case cited the widow of a deceased employe petitioned the Commissioner for a lump sum settlement, and in denying the application Com - missioner Duxbury gave the following pertinent reasons for the Com - mission's actions: "Lump sum payments or settlements in compensation matters do not accord with the policy and purpose of the compensation law, and should be allowed only in special cases. No general rule can possibly be stated that would cover every case, as most of them must depend upon their own peculiar facts and circumstances. "Compensation indemnities are peculiarly sacred to the bene - ficiary, and the law forbids their assignment and makes them ex - empt from levy for the payment of debts. The primary purpose is </seg>
            <seg id="p020">TWENTIETH BIENNIAL REPORT 20 to supply the beneficiary, whether the employe himself or his de - pendents, with a certain means of providing for actual necessities of existence while under disability, or during dependency. Any action which interferes with this fundamental and primary purpose cannot be justified. "It is generally more important to safeguard the principles here stated than to promote any other object that the beneficiaries may have or may entertain. The beneficiary of compensation payments must be protected against the vigilant and pestiferous debt collector, the thrifty real estate salesman, the high-pressured stock salesman, the wiles and ambitions of unwise and irresponsible relatives desiring substantial loans of money from such beneficiaries, and the very many other beguiling influences that beset people without experience in handling and investing money. "They must also be protected against the too common fallacy that some business venture will afford permanent and safe income proceeds. The experience of people in investing money as well as the results of the large percent of business ventures, makes it highly improbable that persons who have had no experience in business or investments can safely be trusted with the management of a lump sum of money. "According to the figures of mercantile experiences more than 90% of all business ventures become insolvent at one time or another, even when conducted by persons who have at least average business experience and ability. There can be no justification, therefore, for permitting persons to engage in business ventures, using their com - pensation as initial capital, when such persons have never had any experience in any business matters and are without any peculiar qual - ifications therefor. "For these reasons, and many others that might be stated, lump sum payments or settlements should not be directed for the purpose of paying debts incurred prior to the accidental injury, or even during the period thereof; of making investments for income purposes, or for engaging in any line of business. The investment with the insurance carrier is generally a much better investment than is likely to be found elsewhere. The compensation law does not recognize the debt obligation, but on the contrary, makes compensation unassignable and exempt from levy. Business ventures are altogether too venture - some to justify the jeopardizing of compensation money in such enterprises. "In addition to this, statistics gathered by the U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics on the result of lump sum payments and settle - ments are so disastrous to the interest of compensation beneficiaries that the Commissioner of Labor Statistics in a paper presented at a convention of the International Association of Industrial Accident Boards and Commissions, concludes without qualification that lump </seg>
            <seg id="p021">STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR 21 sum. payments or settlements ought never to be permitted under any circumstances. "We do not concur in the unconditional conclusion of the com - missioner in that respect, but we are satisfied that there are instances where a lump sum payment or settlement for the purpose of paying mortgaged liabilities on the home of the beneficiary, or other liabili - ties of similar character involving the protection of property neces - sary to the existence of the beneficiary is justified, yet generally his conclusions is unquestionably sound and is supported by many sad experiences in lump sum cases. * * * "It is, of course, within the power of the Commission to so dis - regard these contingencies, but it should not be done unless some sufficient reason appears therefor. It is very rare that a case will arise in which a lump sum settlement of the maximum amount due dependents should be ordered. The fact that they are dependents implies their lack of business experience and ability to handle properly a sum of money in one lump. Their dependent state suggests that this state is likely to continue and should be provided for by the periodical payments. The contingency that dependence may terminate before the whole sum has been paid is important as affecting the rates of compensation insurance. It is quite unlikely that any pe - culiar situation will exist which will overcome these considerations. "In this case the petition suggested that the widow-dependent de - sired to have the money so that she might invest it in income-pro - ducing securities of her own selection. A lump sum settlement should never be made for the purpose of permitting a dependent beneficiary to engage in the business of investing money — one of the most hazardous subjects in the world, and requiring the greatest judgment and experience. "Another reason suggested is that she desires to qualify herself so as to have an earning capacity better than that of an ordinary worker. This is too indefinite and uncertain both with reference to her qualifications for the proposed employment, as well as the pros - pect of employment therein, to justify violating the fundamental purposes of the compensation law, i. e., to provide a certain and regular means of sustenance." </seg>

            <seg id="p029">STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR 29 Contested Compensation Cases During the year 1925, a total of 356 cases were formally heard before the Commissioner and his assistants. Of this nuumber, 129 were dismissed, and in the remainder, or 227, compensation and med - ical expenses was awarded. The assistant to the Commissioner heard 169 of these cases at the Omaha offices of the Commission in the Douglas County Court House. By far a large percentage of these cases arose in Lincoln and Omaha. Nevertheless hearings were held in every section of the state during the year. These hearings necessitated many long jour - neys from Lincoln and Omaha and consumed practically all of the time of the Commissioner, as well as a large portion of the time of his assistants. Following is a brief history of each contested case: 5-211: Earl E. Thompson vs. Great Western Sugar Company, Bayard. (Insurance Carrier: London Guarantee &amp; Accident Company, Ltd.) Plaintiff filed a petition on November 28, 1924, asking for a re - hearing for the purpose of determining the then present disability of his left hand. On August 23, 1922, plaintiff was awarded compensation for 131% weeks at $15.00 per week for 75% of the loss of use of his hand. Upon request of the Commissioner the Industrial Commission of Colorado reheard this case on January 27, 1925, and upon receipt of a certified transcript of the evidence the Nebraska Compensation Com - misioner found that the award previously made should in no way be changed or annulled. 6-143: Fred Yolk vs. Troy Laundry Company, Omaha.

            <seg id="p109">STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR 109 LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL STATISTICS Nebraska has one of the very best child labor laws in the United States. We venture the assertion that it is more rigidly enforced than is that perhaps of any other state. Violations of our child labor legislation have been reduced since 1919-1920 until today they are practically nil. Several factors are responsible for this very satisfactory con - dition, the predominant and outstanding one of which is the interpreta - tion of the provisions of our Workmen's Compensation Law by our Supreme Court in every instance where the question has arisen. . The gist of these decisions is that the illegal employment of a child nullifies the policy of compensation insurance, leaving the em - ployer without that protection and subjecting him to suit under the common law with the consequent heavy damages usually imposed. In the few instances where violations of the law were found a warning to the employer was all that was necessary to bring about the desired result. A glance at the industrial statistics tables for 1924 and 1925, found elsewhere in this report, shows the total ab - sence of child labor employment in industries in Nebraska. During the year 1925 a total of 260 "Age and Schooling Per - mits" were filed with the Department, of which 56 were issued to boys between the ages of 14 and 15 years, and 93 between 15 and 16 years; 34 to girls between 14 and 15 years, and 77 between the ages of 15 and 16 years. Employers Attitude Commendable There has been a general tendency on the part of the employers of female and child labor to comply with the statutory regulations, and the department experienced very little difficulty in their en - forcement. Not a single prosecution was necessary, as the mere calling of the attention of the few offenders to the law was sufficient for its enforcement. The American employer of today shows a greater interest in the welfare of his employes than the employer of former years. His attitude toward the beneficial labor laws is sympathetic rather than hostile. He is not the employer who persistently seeks to violate the female labor law. Danger to Employer However, it will be of interest to some employers to know that the Standard Workmen's Compensation Insurance policies provide that compensation will be paid only to "such of said employes as are legally employed." This means that the employers of children under 16 years of age employed at hazardous occupations, and female labor </seg>
            <seg id="p110">TWENTIETH BIENNIAL REPORT 110 employed contrary to the provisions of the female labor law, are not protected by the Nebraska Workmen's Compensation Law. This department knows of two concrete cases wherein the em - ployers had to pay damages under common law because of the illegal employment of children under 16 years of age, injured in the course of their employment In Fremont one case went to the jury and a judgment of $20,000 was returned against the employer, notwithstanding he carried com - pensation insurance. Later it was settled by the employer by cash payment of $12,000. The other case was at Wahoo where an employer had to pay $4,600 under common law because of the illegal employment of a boy under 16 years of age. This same clause in the compensation insurance policies will apply to any employer who violates the female labor law. The knowledge of these laws on the part of the employers of the state has been a great aid to this department in their enforcement. Factory Inspection Inadequate The only factory inspection by the department during 1925 was a recheck of reports furnished by the regular insurance company inspectors. A special statute requires that a copy of all inspection reports made by them must be filed with the Labor Department. In that way it was possible to keep in touch in a way with the conditions and hazards in the industrial plants, thereby make such recommenda - tions and orders as were necessary. It would, however, be a great advantage, and, in a short time be a great saving in the cost of com - pensation insurance, reduce the number of industrial accidents and eliminate a lot of suffering, if the state legislature would appropriate sufficient funds with which to employ factory inspectors whose entire time could be devoted -to the work of the department outside of the administration of the compensation law. During the year 1925 the entire time of all of the employes of the department had to be given to the administration of the com - pensation law, and for that reason factory inspection could not be given the attention it deserves. Employment Agencies Comply With Law The Department of Labor is charged with supervision of private employment agencies. For ten years its hands were tied by litiga - tion. However, during the year 1925, the organized private employ- and reference bureaus abandoned their fight in the courts, paid the fines that had been assessed against them, applied for licenses and deposited the license fee and furnished the bond as by the statute. </seg>

Industrial Statistics During the year 1925, report blanks were sent to over 1500 manu - facturing establishments in Nebraska, asking them to furnish infor - mation for publication in the Biennial Report of the Department covering their activities for the year 1924. Only 383 returns were received. Again early in the present year these blanks were for - warded to all the manufacturers of the state requesting information as to the 1925 business, and a total of only 436 returns were received out of 1500. From these reports the following tables have been com - piled. While we know they fall far short of representing the gross manufacturing buusiness of the state due to the failure of a large majority to file the reports, they are published for what they are worth. Note the practically total absence of child labor in connec - tion with these reports. </seg>
