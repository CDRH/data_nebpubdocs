            <seg id="p003">EXPERIMENTS IN MULCHING GARDEN VEGETABLES. BY R. A. EMER&gt; INTRODUCTION. The use of a straw mulch in place of cultivation to conserve soil moisture and prevent weed growth in gardens is no new thing. Mulching has found restricted use in vegetable and fruit gardens for many years. Potatoes and strawberries have probably been mulched more than any other crops, but several other vegetables have been occasionally grown in this way, and cultivation in small-fruit gardens, vineyards, and even orchard?, has been not infrequently supplemented by mulching. In many cases very satisfactory results have been reported from the use of mulches. Considerable attention has been given the subject by experiment stations in various parts of the country. A majority of the tests resulted in favor of mulching, and vet, notwithstanding all these good reports, the practice has n become generally popular and must therefore have some serious drawbacks. the fact that excellent results have followed the use of ches in many cases, makes it desirable to test the practice oughly in order to determine what vegetables can be grown :essfully by mulching and what ones cannot, and to deter - e in general, if possible, the conditions under which mulch - can be successfully practiced. It is also important to learn •ther this method of culture cannot be modified so as to do V with some of its bad features. Most farm gardens are made with considerable enthusiasm in the spring. Slany of them are tended carefully at first, but with the approach of dry, hot weather, just when they need attention most, they are usually neglected. Any method of garden culture, therefore, that requires practically na labor dur - ing the summer months when the rush of farm work is greatest, certainly invites careful attention. A test was therefore begun at the Experiment Station in 1900. During the first year, a nearly normal season, mulching •In preaeatin* ttat« hulletln. the writer wishes to arknowledn the ■— iifnre be has received from Mr. Val Keyaer. who bm* kept most of the record* here reported.

In the / dry summer of 1901 the comparison was made on both irri - :d and unirrigated upland. In 1902, mulching was tested omparison with thorough cultivation on both bottom land upland, but naturally neither mulched nor cultivated ground irrigated during this very wet summer.

Partially cured blue grass hay was used for a few vegetables. After </seg>

The comparison therefore is not of mulching versus neglect, but of mulching on the one hand and the most thorough cultivation on the other. In 1901, five plats of vegetables were grown, each plat being about twenty rods long by two rods wide. Two plats were irrigated and three unirrigated. One of the irrigated plats was mulched and the other cultivated. Owing to the small size of the plats, irrigation by the "furrow" method was impracticable. Resort was therefore had to the less satisfactory method of Fig. 8. Partial view of low land garden in 1901.

The slope of the ground was so pronounced that Ras more difficult to apply le cultivated than to the sufficient water at one irrigation mulched ground. The mulched plat therefore received more water at each irrigation than the cultivated plat, but was not irrigated so frequently. Of the three unirrigated plats, one was mulched and two cultivated.

It was applied earlier than in 1900, in some cases being spread soon after the plants came up. The cultivation given the unmulched plats was, as in the first test, as thorough as possible, no weeds being allowed to grow at any time- In 1902, two gardens were laid out, one on rich bottom land that was rather low but well drained, the other on moderately rich upland with a slight southwestern slope. Both gardens were divided lengthwise into two plats, each two and one-half rods wide, the plats on the low land being tvwtnty rods long and on the upland seven rods. One plat was cultivated thoroughly and the other mulched as in previous years. The low land garden was plowed in the spring and worked down with disk and harrow. The ground dried out badly, causing delay in germination of the vegetable seeds. The high land garden was fall plowed. The ground was therefore moist in the spring, favoring prompt germination. Moreover, on this garden site cane had been grown the year before, leaving the ground comparatively free from weeds. The vegetables were planted in rows across the plats, care being taken to have the same number of plants in each plat. The mulch consisted of old straw and was about four inches deep after settling. In most cases it, was applied about a month after the plants or secde were planted, the ground being cultivated two or three times before the mulch was spread. Figures 1 and 2 present partial views of the low land garden. In addition to the general tests noted above, a special experi - ment was conducted with potatoes in 1902. A comparison was made of different depths of mulching, different materials for the mulch, different times of applying the mulch, etc. tesides the tests carried on in the gardens of the Experiment ion, the value of mulching as a meihod of garden culture also been tried by the Experiment Station in cooperation 1 farmers in many sections of the State. The results of e cooperative tests are to be reported in a separate bulletin. </seg>
            <seg id="p007">7 RESULTS OF THE MULCHING TESTS. LETTUCE. In 1900 a heading lettuce, Iceberg, was grown, and in 1901 a loose-leaved variety, Grand Rapids. In 1902, two sorts, Grand Rapids and Tennis Ball, the latter a heading lei were raised. The first season, the seed was sown April 19 and the plants were cultivated until June 9, when one plat was mulched, cultivation being continued in the other until the last of June. In 1901 the seed was sown April 27, the plants being cultivated until June 1, when the mulch was spread. Cultivation was continued in the unmulched plats until late in June. In 1902 the seed was drilled March 25 in the low land garden, but owing to very dry weather in the spring, did not germinate for several weeks. The mulch was applied May 22, the plants having been cultivated only once. The unmulched plat was cultivated twice afterwards. No lettuce was grown on the high land.

The summer cab - bage, Surehead, however, grew much larger on the cultivated than on the mulched plat. A late variety of cabbage planted in 190 1 gave no returns. It was noticed that grasshoppers attacked the mulched plants more than the cultivated ones, as was to be expected from the habits of this insect. The same thing has been noticed in some of the cooperative tests of mulching, to be reported in a later bulletin. On the whole, these tests are very favorable to mulching. Cabbage plants are not easily mulched when small, but the work can be done readily enough within two to four weeks after planting, at any time when farmers are not especially rushed with work. It is quite evident, however, that mulching cannot be successfully practiced where grasshoppers are very abun- TOMATOKS. I'erfection tomato was grown in 1900, Stone in 1901 and 1902, Dwarf Champion in all three seasons. The seeds were ■n in flats in the greenhouse in all cases. In 1900 the plants e set in the garden May 24 and the mulch spread June 11, r all plants had been cultivated three times. Cultivation was tinued in the unmulched plat until about the middle of July. [901 the plants were not set out until June 12, the mulch lg applied only a few days later. The unmulched plants e cultivated carefully throughout the summer. In 1902 the isplanting was done May 15 and the mulching June 12, after :e cultivations. The unmulched plat on high land was culti - fd seven times, the one on low land six times. The results of the three years' tests of tomatoes are as follows </seg>

The difference was less upright growing Dwarf Champion than with the Iey" Stone ard Perfection. In our rich soils tomato plants, icularly the large growing sorts, when provided with an idant supply of moisture, are apt to make vigorous vine wth at the expense of fruit production. Probably by keep - the soil too cool and wet and by preventing proper aeration easons of heavy rainfall, mulches decrease vigor of vine wth and thereby increase fruitfulness. In 1902 the cultivated ts were decidedly ahead of the mulched ones in vigor of .vth, the mulched plants being smaller and their foliage h lighter in color than the cultivated ones. 11 1 901 the mulched tomatoes on irrigated land yielded more 1 the cultivated ones, the difference being considerable in of Dwarf Champion and slight in case of Stone. On unir - ted land, the Dwarf Champion tomatoes yielded the same on 1 plats while the Stone yielded almost twice as much per t by cultivation as by mulching. This season, unlike the • preceding and the one following it, was very dry. The Its, however, do not necessarily mean that mulching is itisfactory in a dry season. They are rather to be ained by the fact that the mulch was spread too soon </seg>
            <seg id="p011">11 after the plants were set out. Tomato plants are especial - ly sensitive to cold. Frosts are more apt to occur on mulched than on cultivated land and are more severe by from three to five degrees. While in this case the mulched tomatoes were not actually frosted, they must nevertheless have been sub - jected to considerably lower temperatures at night than the cul - tivated ones. The early growth of tomatoes was plainly retard - ed by the mulch. Some of the plants afterwards recovered, though several of them died. The mulched plants of the early and hardy variety. Dwarf Champion, suffered comparatively lit - tle at first and finally overtook the cultivated plants. With the later and possibly more tender variety, Stone, only a few plants survived and they were never able to overcome their early handicap. In fact, the plants in all plats got such a late start in 1901 that few fruits ripened, the figures for 1901 in the table representing largely the yield of green fruit. IVlulched tomatoes are usually less subject to rot than culti - ed ones, owing, probably, to their being kept free from dirt in ay weather. The mulched tomatoes are also larger as a rule I more regular in shape. On the other hand, tomatoes, like very tender plants, are injured worse by early fall frosts en mulched than when cultivated. Ki general, then, mulching has given good results with toma - , both in yield and quality of fruit. Care must be exercised to mulch such tender vegetables as tomatoes until they have &gt;me well established. PEAS. IL.merican Wonder peas were grown each of the three sea - 1 during which mulching tests have been carried on. Cham - 1 of England were grown in 1900 and 1901, but in the latter ion yielded no crop. In 1900 the seed was sown April 21 the mulch spread May 18. Cultivation was continued in the mlched plat until the 1st of June. In 1901 the seed was sown il22 and the plants mulched June 1, cultivation being contin - in the unmulched plats as usual. In 1902 the seed was sown il 5, straw being spread on the mulched plat May 22 andcul - tion being continued on the other plat throughout June. The following results were obtained with peas: </seg>
            <seg id="p012">I&gt; mulching was decidedly ahead in case of American Won - peas, and cultivation somewhat ahead in case of Champion ngland, the yield of the latter variety, however, being very • on both plats. The vines grew much larger on the :hed than on the cultivated ground, but were not provided supports and therefore matted down, causing the pods to iy before they were fully developed. The mulched peas : somewhat later than the cultivated ones. Further trial is :ssary to determine the value of mulching in growing this Iy, early vegetable. BEANS.

In 1002 the dry green shell beans grown were Navy, Henderson's Bush 1 and Dwarf Horticultural, and the snap beans Challenge k, Wardwell, Stringless Green, and Mohawk. In 1900 the beans were planted May 5, the green shell beans May 1 2 19, and the dry beans May 23. All kinds were mulched 12, after being cultivaied two or three times.

            <seg id="p014">14 Golden Wax beans. With the Lima beans there was little dif - ference in yield between mulching and cultivation. The snap beans were a few days later on the mulch than on the cultivated ground but continued in bearing somewhat longer. The pods of the mulched plants, moreover, were larger and more uniform in sizi and color. In 1901, late planting coupled with severe drouth made all but the Henderson's Bush Lima a complete failure. The Golden Wax beans on the mulched plats remained green longer than those on the cultivated plats, but owing to the extremely dry, hot winds at blossoming time were unable to set any pods, even where irrigated. The leaves of Burpee's Bush Lima were badly burned in the cultivated plats by the last of July and much less severely injured in the mulched plats. This Lima and the Navy grew more vigorously on the mulched than on the cultivated ground and set many more pods, but late planting, together with delayed development at blossoming time on account of hot dry winds, made it impossible for these varie - ties to ripen before frost. The same difference in vigor of growth and numbers of pods set was seen in case of Henderson's Buih Lima. The mulched plants, however, being later than the others, did not ripen so well before frost. In the wet season of 1902, mulching proved better than cultivation, as a whole, on the high ground, but poorer on the low ground. It seems fair to conclude from these tests that in normal sea - sons mulching produces better yields of beans than cultivation does, except in case of late planting or of naturally late growing varieties. In such cases, by delaying maturity, mulches increase the possibility of loss from early frosts. CUCUMBERS. White Spine cucumbers were grown in all the tests, and in Iition Boston Pickling was raised in 1900. The first year, seed was cultivated about May 10, the mulch being spread e 12, after both plats had been cultivated three times. The ts were picked about every third day during the greater part fuly and somewhat less frequently during August. The White Spine cucumber yielded as follows: Mulch 1065 fruits weighing 718 pounds Cultivation 823 fruits weighing 522 pounds There was then little difference in size of fruits, the important difference between the plats, aside from the yields, being in the uniformity of the product. During dry periods, the cultivated </seg>
            <seg id="p015">15 Embers decreased in numbers and those that grew were of irregular shape, many of them being very poorly devel - 1. The mulched fruits, on the contrary, were ah\ glit and evenly filled out to the end. The Boston Pickling cucumbers in 1901 were picked while very small, no account being taken of their weights. The mulchad plat produced 1298 fruits as against 984 on the culti - vated plat. The mulched plants were somewhat later than the others, the yield for the first three weeks, from June 26 to July 13, being 364 fruits from the mulched plat and 445 from the cul - tivated one. In 1901 the seed was planted May 28 and the mulch spread June 8, before the plants had made much growth. The small, tender plants were plainly injured by this early mulching and the dry weather came on before they had recovered. Plant lice hurt the plants of the cultivated plats worse than of the mulched ones and were especially injurious on the irrigation-cultivation plat, reducing the yields decidedly. Whether this difference in insect injury was due to differences in methods of culture or merely accidental cannot be told, though later experience points to the former as being the most probable. The only method of culture that gave good results was the combination of irrigation and mulching, which produced a yield of 68 pounds of cucum - bers, as against only about 10 pounds from each of the other plats. In 1902 the planting was done May 12 and mulching June The mulched plats were cultivated three times and the cultivated ones six to seven times. The cold, wet weather was very un - favorable to these tender plants. The plant lice were also a very serious hindrance. The vines on the low land were sprayed once with resin compound, with fair results, and once later with tobac - co infusion, wiih absolutely no beneficial effects, the crop being an entire failure on both plats. On the high land the plant lice were also very bad, attacking the mulched plants first. All plants were sprayed twice with resin compound, which reduced the injury from these insects materially, especially on the mulched ground, which later in the season from the few hills yielded 25 pounds of cucumbers, the cultivated vines producing absolutely nothing. Entire failure from cold, wet weather and from insect attack was very common throughout the state in 1902. It is therefore especially noteworthy that in these tests th«* mulched plants lived and finally yielded some return, while the cultivated ones produced nothing. </seg>
            <seg id="p016">16 MUSKMELONS AND WATEkMELONS. In 1900 the melons were planted May 12 and mulched a month later, after having been cultivated three times. The un - mulched plats were cultivated eight times in all. The varietj of watermelon grown was Ice Cream and the muskmelon was Rncess. The watermelons )ielded as follows: Mulch 153 fruits weighing 1324 pounds Cultivation 8" fruits weighing 910 pounds The mulched fruits, though more numerous, were smalltr ti the others and of poorer flavor, especially the later riper - ones. They were, as a whole, somewhat later than the cul- tivated melons. The results with muskmelons were as follows: Mulch. Ill fruits weighing 328 pounds Cultivation 91 fruits weighing 305 pounds The mulched fruits ripened earlier than the cultivated ones, but were somewhat smaller. The same varieties of melons were grown in 1901 as in the previous year. The seed was planted May 28 and the mulch spread about a week, later, when the young plants had barely started growth. Such tender vegetables as melons were very seriously injured by this early mulching. The mulched plants were not killed by frost, but the cooler soil under the mulch and the greater extremes of temperature above it so weakened the plants that many of them succumbed to the dry weather later without having grown more than a few inches in height. Some of the plants, however, lived and in time nearly recovered. The yield of fruits, however, was less on the mulched than on the cultivated ground, except in the case of the irrigated plats, where the plant lice destroyed most of the plants on the cultivated ground. In 1902 the Triumph watermelon and Green Nutmeg muskmelon were grown on the low ground, but were complete failures on account of the cold, wet weather. It cannot be said that the tests here reported have proven whether or not mulching can be used successfully in growing melons. They have certainly shown that if mulching is to be practiced, the straw must not be applied until the plants have become thoroughly established. They are too tender to stand </seg>
            <seg id="p017">Experiments in Mulching Garden Vegetable*. 17 SWBKT CORN. Red Cob Corey sweet corn was tested in 1900, but there was Ie difference in yield between the plats, the results being htly in favor of mulching. In 1901 Stowell's Evergreen was wn. The unirrigated plants were almost an entire failure. e mulched corn, however, remained green somewhat longer 1 the cultivated corn. On the irrigated ground a much be&gt; yield was secured by mulching than by cultivation. The ivated plat, however, was not so thoroughly irrigated as the mulched plat, hence the results are not comparable. In 1902 Stowell's Evergreen was planted May 12 and mulched June 12, the mulched plat being cultivated three times and the unmulched one seven times. The yields follow: Mulch High land, 90 pounds: low land. 76 pounds Cultivation High land, 191 pounds; low land, 113 pounds The mulched plants were smaller and less vigorous throughout t summer. Much of the time their leaves were yellowish M, just as corn leaves often are when the plants stand in , poorly-drained soil. The mulch, in short, affected the corn its much as it did the tomato plants, but decreasing the vigor weet corn in this way decreased the yield of ears instead of making the plants more fruitful as in the case of tomatoes. In both 1900 and 1901 it was noticed that chinch bugs tcked the cultivated corn sooner and injured it more seriously 1 the mulched corn, the straw apparently making it diffi- cult for these insects to reach the plants. It is doubtful if mulching will ever prove of practical use in case of a crop that can be grown as easily as sweet corn can by cultivation, even should the yield be increased somewhat by the practice. Mulching is certainly undesirable for sweet corn in wet seasons. BEETS Columbia and Half Long beets were grown in 1901, being planted April 19 and mulched June 9. The actual yields were somewhat in favor of mulching, but the stand was so uneven that the yields should not be compared. The beets from the mulched ground were a little better in appearance than those from the cultivated land. In 1901 Columbia beets were planted April 20 and mulched </seg>

Sandwich Island salsify was tested in 1901 and 1902, being grown only on the low land the second year.

Hollow Crown parsnip and leart carrot were the varieties grown. They were planted il 24 and mulched June 12. The cultivation was much the same as for beets and salsify. The yields were as follows: Cultivation 160 pounds parsnips, 74 pouin The figures indicate that on low ground in a wet year carrots fl better by mulching than by cultivation, while the reverse ue of parsnips. The latter vegetable not only yielded less on mulched than on the cultivated ground but was also of poor- er quality, many of the roots being fibrous and spongy. ONIONS. In these tests with onions the crops have been grown in two ways. In some cases the seed has been sown in the garden with seed drills in the ordinary way and in some cases it has been sown in flats in the greenhouse and the seedlings transplanted into the garden later, as is usually done with early cabbage and toma- toes. In the following account of mulching experiments with onions the two methods are considered separately. Drilled onions. — In 1900 seed of Red Wethersfirld onion Is sown in the garden April 12 and mulched June 9, after 'ing been thinned and weeded by hand and cultivated four es with a wheel hoe. The mulch could not have been applied Her without hurting the stand of plants. The unmulched plat s cultivated or hoed four times after the straw was spread the mulched plat. The yield was the same, 94 pounds, on both plats. In 1901 Red Wethersfield and Prize Taker onions were grown. An attempt was made to decrease the amount of labor required in growing mulched onions. The mulch was therefore applied earlier, fewer cultivations being given the mulched plat than in the previous year. This early mulching, however, killed so many of the plants that the yield from the mulched plats was reduced especially in case of the irrigation-mulch plat. The yields follow Irrigated. Not irrigated. Red Wethersfield: Mulch &gt; pounds 13 pounds Mulch ■ ■ pounds parsnips, 110 poun. </seg>
            <seg id="p020">20 Prize Taker: Mulch 5 pounds 13 pounds Cultivation 28 pounds 14 pounds Transplanted onions. — This method of growing onions was used in the mulching tests of 1901 and 1902. Red Weth- ersfield and Prize Taker onions were grown the first season and Prize Taker alone the second. The seed was sown in flats in the greenhouse March 2, 1901, and the young plants trans- planted into the garden M.iy 8, when the bulbs were about as thick as a lead pencil. The mulch was spread June 1, after one cultivation. The unmulched plants were cultivated only twice afterwards. In 1902 the onion seedlings were transplanted into the garden May 7 and the mulch applied June 12, the mulched plants being cultivated three times and the unmulched ones seven times. The yields for the two years were as follows: 1901. Irrigated. Not irrigated Red Wethersfield : Mulch 20 pounds 13 pounds Cultivation. . . . . 18 pounds 13 pounds Prize Taker: Mulch 30 pounds 16 pounds Cultivation 27 pounds 14 pounds 1902. High land. Low land. Prize Taker: Mulch . . .25 pounds 17 pounds Cultivation... 27 pounds 31 pounds In general it is seen that mulching has slightly increased the yield of transplanted onions in a few cases and decreased it in others. There is little, therefore, to be gained by mulching, ex- cept thit the labor required for mulching is perhaps somewhat less than for cultivation. In the case of drilled onions, mulching is out of the question, owing to the difficulty of spreading the straw without hurting the stand of plants. POTATOES. E irly Ohio potatoes were grown for the mulching tests each of the three years that this method of culture has been under trial. In 1900 the planting was done May 3 and the mulch spread June 12, after the potatoes had been cultivated three times. The unmulched plat was cultivated three times more during the season. In 1901 the tubers were planted April 20 and mulched June 1, after one cultivation, the unmulched plat being cultivated frequently throughout the remainder of the season. In 1902 the date of planting was April 4 and of mulch- </seg>

In 1901 ihe yield on unirrigated land was increased 17 per cent by mulching. The difference would undoubtedly have been even greater had not the unmulched potatoes been given very thorough cultivation, thus producing a fair yield in this unusually dry year when the potato crop failed in many parts of the state. The mulched tubers were also fully as good in quality as the cultivated ones. On irrigated land in 1901 the mulched potatoes yielded 27 per cent more than the cultivated ones, but owing to the soil's having been kept too wet while the tubers were maturing, they were rough and watery. Moreover, they did not keep so well as the tubers from the cul - tivated plat when stored for winter. In 1902 mulching decreased the yield 5 per cent on the high land and 10 per cent on the low land, little difference being noticed in regard to quality of tubers. SPECIAL POTATO TEST. In addition to the general tests noted above, a special test was conducted with potatoes in 1902, the Early Six Weeks vari - ety being used. The potato garden was four rods wide by seven rods long, and was divided into fifteen equal plats, twelve of which were mulched the day after the seed was planted, the other three beinjr cultivated Of the block formed bv these </seg>

In the north half of the block the potatoes were planted 18 x 36 inches apart and in the south half 18 x 18 inches. Each of these halves again divided lengthwise into two equal parts, in the north part of each the tubers being planted four inches deep and in the south part one inch deep. The three cultivated plats joined the mulched ones on the north. Two of these were given thorough cultivation throughout the summer. The east one was culti - vated until late in July and then, after the new tubers had begun to form, mulched with about four inches of straw. The yields of the various plats in pounds are given in the following table: Hills 18x 36 in. Hills 18x18 in. * Method of culture. h Lbs.

A 4-inch straw mulch applied as soon as the seed was planted decreased the yield about 11 per cent, and an 8-inch straw mulch applied early decreased it 34 per cent. The early 4-inch manure mulch, however, increased the yield over cultivation by 29 per cent. The mulched tubers were not so smooth as the cultivated ones, but no other differences were noticeable. r-r~ z-t r 1 !- Lbs. Lbs. Lbs. </seg>
            <seg id="p023">23 Considering now only the plants that were mulched early, it is seen that the best yields were obtained in all cases from the use of coarse manure as mulch. The four manure-mulched plats yielded 29 per cent more than the four plats mulched to the same depth with straw. Whether this will prove true in a season of less rainfall has not been determined. The tubers that were mulched with manure were more seriously injured by scab than those that were mulched with straw. This was especially true of the shallow planted ones. As between 8-inch and 4-inch straw mulches, everything this year was in favor of the shallower mulch. The total yield of the four shallow-mulched plats was about 62 per cent more than that of the four deep - mulched plats. The deep mulch hurt the stand of plants very noticeably. The differences between shallow and deep planting were almost as pronounced as those between shallow and deep mulching. In all cases the potatoes that were barely covered with soil when planted were better than those that were planted at the usual depth, the total yield of the six shallow-planted plats being 13 per cent greater than that of the six deep-planted ones. A further advantage of shallow planting where potatoes are to be mulched is the ease with which the crop is harvested. The tubers are formed practically at the surface of the ground and when the mulch has been raked off can be picked up without any appreciable effort in digging. Iince early-mulched potatoes are not cultivated, no inconven - :e results from having the rows close together. In all cases one in this test the close-planted potatoes yielded more than al areas planted twice as far apart, the total yield of the close-planted plats being about 48 per cent more than of the er six plats. For equal amounts of seed planted, however, close-planted plats yielded less by about 26 per cent than 3e planted at about the usual distance. Whether close plant - will prove as good in a dryer year has not been determined. On the whole, mulching has proven a very satisfactory way of growing garden potatoes. The yield is usually increased and the quality not hurt by mulching, except in very wet seasons or places, both of which are unusual in Nebraska. Though the yield last year was better when the plants were mulched late than when early mulching was practiced, the latter certainly de - serves further trial, since it reduces very materially the labor required in growing the crop and may therefore prove prefera - ble, even if the yield is reduced. </seg>
            <seg id="p024">24 SWEET POTATOES. Sweet potatoes were tested in 1901, Yellow Jersey being the variety grown. The plants were set in the garden early in June, the mulch being applied before the vines began to run and the unmulched plats being given careful cultivation as long as possible. One half of the plants of all plats were grown on ridges and the other half by level culture. The following yields were Irrigated. Not irrie Method of culture. Ridpe. Level. Ridg&lt; Mulch rultivation Khe mulch increased the yield over cultivation in all cases, the 1 yield of the four mulched plats being iy per cent greater 1 that of the four cultivated plats. The sweet potato tubers from the mulched plats were longer and more slender than those from the cultivated plats, this being especially noticeable on the irrigated land. This tendency is certainly not desirable and if it proves common may make mulching an undesirable method of culture for sweet potatoes. The vines on the mulched plats were injured much more severely by frost occurring soon after the middle of September than those on the cultivated plat. '1'he cultivated plants were injured somewhat, many of the leaves being blackened by the frost. The vines recovered entirely, however, long before the next frost. The mulched plants, on the contrary, were so severely injured that they never fully recovered. The frost, however, did not hurt the quality of the tubers, and since the yield was even greater from the mulched than from the culti - vated plats the injury to the vines from frost was no great drawback to the use of mulches in growing sweet potatoes. Iiweet potato vines do not take root through a straw mulch they do on bare ground — an unquestionable advantage of Iching. Furthermore, thorough cultivation of any vine p, like the common varieties of sweet potatoes, is a difficult lertaking. Such a crop can be cultivated easily until the es begin to run, when the mulch should be spread. IM. tk Um. 72 47 46 40 42 47 </seg>
            <seg id="p025">25 Khis single test may be said, then, to have given results iedly favorable to mulching. Further tests, of course, are ssary before definite conclusions can be reached. DISCUSSION OF RESULTS. Whether mulchirg will prove satisfactory depends in part upon the location of the garden and the character of the season. In general, mulches may be expected to give better results in normal or rather dry years than in seasons of unusu - ally heavy rainfall. Similarly, in very wet seasons better results may be expected from the use of mulches on high land than on low land. Such seasons, however, are not common in Nebraska. The effect of a mulch in conserving soil moisture during dry periods is very noticeable. During July and August, 1900, soil moisture determinations were made in the mulched and cultivated plats of cabbage, peas, beans, cucumbers, water - melons, sweet corn, and beets. Soil samples taken at a depth of from six to nine inches in the mulched plat contained an average of 18.2 per cent of moisture, as against 17.1 in the cul - tivated plats. Whether mulching shall be used in a particular case depends also upon the vegetables to be grown. Early spring vegetables requiring only a few cultivations can usually be grown more cheaply by cultivation than by mulching. Further - more, very early mulching, before the ground has become thoroughly warm, is apt to retard the development of the etables. On the other hand, summer or fall vegetables that require frequent cultivation throughout the season are grow a rule with less labor by mulching than by cultivation. Fur - thermore, the mulch can often be spread at a time when other farm work is not especially pressing. If cultivation alone is depended upon, the garden may be cared for well enough early in the season but is almost sure to be neglected later, when the rush of summer's farm work is on and when, owing to dry, hot weather, the need of proper care is most imperative. Irhe fact that most vegetables, especially the more tender ids, cannot be mulched until they have become well estab - led and the weather has become warm, thus requiring some iliminary cultivation, certainly increases the labor required in wing mulched vegetables over what would be necessary if mulch could be applied earlier. But, if the impracticability early mulching is a serious drawback to the use of mulches, is the impracticability of midsummer cultivation under farm </seg>
            <seg id="p026">26 conditions a serious objection to dependence upon cultivation alone. For most vegetables, mulching should be used to sup - plement cultivation rather than to displace it. Such cultivation as is commonly given farm gardens is better for most vege - tables in early spring than mulching, but mulching is just as surely better in midsummer than the neglect which is the com - mon thing in farm gardens at that time of year. The Experi - ment Station tests have indeed shown mulching to be better in many cases than the most thorough cultivation throughout the summer. &gt;t only are many vegetables grown with less labor by mulching than by cultivation, but the yield and quality of the product is also often improved. In several cases yields have been decreased by mulching. In some of these, however, the injury was due not so much to the use of a mulch as to its being applied too early. I^he vegetables which, from the tests at the Experiment Sta - i, it is thought unwise to mulch are drilled onions, lettuce and ret corn. With drilled onions, the stand of plants is usually t by mulching. With lettuce, it is also difficult to spread the Ich without injury to the stand, and the crop is harvested so y that it is not worth while to mulch. With sweet corn, the ds are about the same in a normal season whether mulched cultivated, but this crop requires so few cultivations that Iching is hardly profitable. In a wet season mulching reases the yield decidedly. Ecase of transplanted onions, beets, salsify, carrots, parsnips, , and melons, the results are not decidedly in favor of either e two methods, both the yields and the required labor being it the same. I Results very favorable to mulching have been secured with hage, tomatoes, beans, cucumbers, potatoes, and sweet pota - i. In all these cases the yields have been increased on the ole quite decidedly by mulching and the required labor de - ased at the same time. Mulched cabbage produced larger ds than cultivated cabbage, and there was less injury n rot. The vigor of tomato plants was decreased by niulch - , but the yield of fruit increased. The fruit was also cleaner less subject to rot. Mulched cucumbers produced perfect ts during dry periods when the fruit from the cultivated its was small and imperfect. The quality of potatoes has not n hurt by mulching except in wet places </seg>
