REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION. 

Section 7, Subdivision VIII, of the school law, requires an 

annual report containing a statement of the school funds of the 

i 

State, an account of the receipts and expenditures for school 

purposes, a statement of the condition of the common schools 
and other educational institutions chartered by the State, and a 

statement of such plans as lie may devise for the better manage- 

ol funds and the school system, together with 

ment 

Such a report was made one year ago but not printed, insufficient 
funds being provided for printing both that and this. 
Figures taken from that will be used in this for the purpose of 
comparison. 

A general summary will be given of the detailed reports found 
at the close. 

In the general summary which follows, the reports for the two 
years ending respectively April, 1881 and April, 1882, will be 
given. Tabulated reports by counties will be found at the close 
of this report.

REPORT OF THB 

make a very fair exhibition of this class of educational w 

in 1881, 42 principals reported from as many graded schools, 
only 27 such reports were received this year. These reports 
e supplemented this year by reports from county superin- 
Jents showing the number of graded schools to be 74. 
eral superintendents made no report, and in such countieB 
f such schools were placed as are kno%vn from previous rets 
to be graded.* 

DISTRICTS. 

The number of districts has steadily increased, and it is believed 
that the growth has been legitimate. According to the 
present law no district can be formed having less than six sections 
of land, unless there is sufficient taxable property to insure good 
schools. The working of this law has prevented much division, 
and we may hope that the number of. weak districts will gradually 
decrease. 

•The annual reports of Superintendent! show the number given in Table VIII 

vent. Very few of them refuse to have school from a feeling 

of opposition to schools. Whatever the causes may be it ii 

tifying to know that thej are growing leas. During 1879 

there were 173 and daring 1880, "210 reported as having nc 

school. An . w of 269 districts in the two years and i 

decrease in the aamber having no school shows a condition ol 

appreciation on the part of the public. 

GRADED SCHOOLS. 

rthc cloae of the report is appended a table ¦bowing the 
of our graded system. Unfortunately, many of the 

blanks sent out were not returned and the report tor this year 

is very incomplete. Late in the Pall a blank was sent to county 

terintendents, asking for report* concerning graded and par- 
ly graded school* and of private schools and colleges. Some- 

of these blanks were not returned but enough were returned to </seg>

SUPERINTENDENT OP PUBLIC INSTRUCTION. 

It is recommended that the law be amended so that county 

superintendents shall be empowered to attach those districts, too 

weak to maintain three months school, to adjoining districts, 

thus giving them the benefit of school privileges. On the other 

hniid, there are many strips of territory, notably along the Piatte 

River, that are isolated by that stream so that the pupils resident 

upon them cannot ordinarily attend school. I recommend that 

power be given the superintendents in such exceptional cases, to 

form districts less than six sections in sizt 

In some instances districts refuse to elect officers and maintain 

id children are thus deprived of their edu- 
I think it would be wise in such cases to 

r organization, a 

ationa 

pcrintendent to appoint officers to till the vacant 

mnower 

positions and recommend such an amendment

            <seg id="p014">
ceivcd on leases goes into the temporary school fund. This 
¦mounted in 1881, to $79,6^6.06, and in June, 1882, it amounts] 
to $38,857. As before stated, there are some defects in the law 
relating to these lands. The Board of Educational Lands and 
Funds is | ic nverless to cause forfeiture of con tract when lessee refuses 
to comply with the contract and make prompt payment upon his 

It*. There are now many payments that are delinquent, estited 
as amounting to |150,000; and many thousand acres held 
delinquent lessees. As the law now stands, the State 
uld be compelled to go into the courts and obtain a decree of 
feiture, in order to recover its own lands. If the Board wore 

empowered to declare forfeiture in accordance with their jnd 
ment, there would be much less delinquency than at present. 

Inother point I desire to call particular attention to. When 
I that have been leased are sold, an appniisal of their value 
tade, and this appraisal is final. The Board is compelled 
ake the deed, unless positive evidence of fraud appears. In 
-eg parties have offered twice, and in some eases, three 
- the appraised value, but the law compels the 
•d to sell to the lessee at the appraised value. The three disvsted 
freeholders who make the appraisement may be incae 
or dishonest, but their appraisement is final, and the deed 
: be given by the Board. 

Eis seldom that lands are appraised at more than seven or 
t dollars, even when lands adjoining are rated at fifteen or 
itv dollars. The lessee is entitled to the benefit of all im- 

Eements made by himself, but should pay a fair valuation 
deducting these. 

It has been a wise policy of the State to make liberal terms 
to those investing in school lands for the purpose of improving 
them, but this liberality has been taken advantage of and many 
lands have been leased as a speculation, and payment! upon such 
¦ an frequently delinquent, and the lands are held out of 
market. A premium for improv made upon all lands

SCHOOL HOUSES. 

I 'here have been 402 houses built during the last two years, 
se have ranged from the inexpensive "dug-out" to the costly 
k building, large enough to accommodate its hundreds. We 
e no means of determining the aggregate cost of these buildl, 
as that item is given in connection with others. Many 
ses have been built without much regard to health, beauty or 
fort. The house itself should be an educator, harmonious in 
ine, adapted to its purpose, comfortable and healthful. The 
irtnii'iit has frequently been requested to furnish plans, but 
been wholly unable to do so. If a few good plans with spec- 

ifications could be furnished for gratuitous distribution, the cost 
would be trifling compared with the benefit derived. Investigations 
made in many schools show that diseases of the eye are 
very frequent, and the cause is traced directly to improper light, 
difficulty is one easily remedied when attention is called to 
it while building. Improper or insufficient ventilation is a fruitful 
source of disease, and future usefulness is destroyed on ac- 

count of disease contracted in the

received more attention, and 

ter deformed bodies are charged up to school account than 
nerly. In view of the above facts. I would recommend that 
tuall appropriation be made for the purpose of publishing 
is. and the department permitted to distribute them to parcontemplating 
building. 

HOOL BLANK FORM 

\n increased appropriation for blanks has been asked t 

ise the last was not adequate. Some blanks heretofore n

.ml' of considerable importance, were dropped from the list 

McaukM of insufficient fuuds, The new law required lomo new

very imperfect records are kept. In addition to this, the cost to 
the individual districts, purchasing blanks at retail prices, is 
much greater than it would be to the State purchasing them at 
contract prices. The cost in either MM must be borne by the 
people and derived from taxation. Would it not be wise to supply 
the blanks at the smallest po&gt;sible cost'.' If, in addition to 
reduced cost, more perfect methods of doing bOMDMi Wi taken 
into consideration, and the saving arisitiir from ¦ better &gt;ystem of 
management, it would seem all the more necessary for the State 
to furnish these blanks. I therefore recommend that this subject 
receive the attention its importance demands, afld ask that investigations 
be made to see if the view I have taken be correct. 
The tirst cost may seem large, bat if wise economy approve rhe 
course, the first cost to the State should be a secondary consider- 

ation.

KEPORT OF THE 

TEACHERS' INSTITUTES 

The law now provides for two kinds of institutes; Normal Institutes 
to be organized by the State Superintendent and county 
rutes to be organized by County Superintendents. During 
1 S M, several institutes were organized by the State Superintend- 
M&amp; It was (band that very few teachers, outside the county in 
which the institute was located, attended. And although these 
•utes were fairly successful, yet it was believed a much larger 
atti hlance could be secured by having more county institutes. 
-•¦quently during the year just closing, no such institutes were 
organised. The result was a8 anticipated. More county insti 
were held and a larger attendance in many cases secured. 
i a fund is created, enabling the State Superintendent to 
loy comj -distance and pay the expenses necessary, it 
will be better to rely upon the County Institute. The scarcity 
of good conductors has been severely felt and want of funds ha* 
hampered many. But with the modifications elsewhere sug-1 
many difficulties will be removed. 

It would be wise to require some special qualifications on the 
of instructors in these institutes. In many states they can 
not be paid from the institute fund unless holding a certificate 
. the State Superintendent, empowering them to teach. It 
will be necessary to throw some such guard around this fund or

I Hiring the summer of 1881, I visited twenty institutes and 
vered lector i&lt;;s " talks" to fa at nearly all of

hope that some good was accomplished. 

It has been my constant effort to awaken popular interest and 
cause an increased appreciation of the benefit to be derived frofll 
good schools. County superintendent! un&lt;l teaehen have ably 
seconded me in this work. Many superintendents are now conducting 
interesting columns in their county papers, reaching the 
people in this way and creating a demand for better work and 
better workers. The general sentiment of the peopla M in favor 
of good schools, and the popular demand, once fonnulatod, will 
call upon teachers to tit themselves for better work or make 

room for those who will. God speed the lav

One difficulty in the way was the want of fund- to publish the 

work. This was met by charging a small sum tor each e 

just sufficient to cover the cost. As small as this sum

Sudi is the moving power controlling all others in a government 
founded as ours is, and resting on almost universal suffrage. 

It is needless to say, it is of unspeakable importance that a 

power so vast and so far-reaching, should be intelligently exer- 

cised. It may be admitted that the most ignorant and untrained 

of all our people would not naturally imperil or destroy institu- 

tions so precious as our«. But even honest ignorance is danger 

ous. Beyond the facility with which it may be employed by 

ambitious, selfish and unpatriotic men, lies the fact of its inca- 

pacity to bring to the consideration of the public questions that 

must, constantly arise, a sound and wise .judgment. It will, it 

must exert its power : but whether tor good or evil, is a thing of 

haphazard 

Instead, therefore, of doubting whether the general education 
I the JOOng before they conn.' to adult years, is a matter on: 

iveruruental concern, it is a wonder that it does not absorb 

more of the public interest and attention, more of the wise 

of the Government itself. No government can Ml befoi 

a higher duty than that of making provision for its perpetuity

Ifiei Jbate Keith, of Thayer county, read an interesting 
paper m "Woman*! influence in the common schools." The 
tenor of the discussion was. that female teachers should have the 
same wage* as male, and that the former are preferable in priniiirv 
and in summer district schools. E. E. Armor, of York, 
read a paper taking for a subject: "Thoughts on our school 
question : U elevated class of teachers our aim." 

t Subdivision I, of the school law entitled " School Districts" was

L1BKAKY AND HEADING KOOM 

The Library now comprises over 2,000 volumes, and the Reading-room 
b furnished with the leading periodicals and current 
literature of the day. The room, however, which is now too 
email, is much in need of furniture and repairs, and there is no 
public fund now available for these purposes. 

THE FACULTY 

The Faculty as now constituted is supposed to consist of a 
principal and nine assistant teachers with as many corresponding 
positions, but owing to a deficit in the last appropriation two 
of these positions could not be filled with regular teachers this 
year, and this has been not only a source of inconvenience but 
a disadvantage to the school. In the meantime the chair of 
Language has been filled by teachers in other departments, and 
that of Drawing, Reading and Penmanship, by pupil teachers. 
The school is much in need of two additional teachers, and in 
order to secure them an increase of appropriation is necessary. 
It is foil}- to suppose that true normal school work can be successfully 
accomplished on low salaries. For, in addition to the 
scholastic acquirements of the ordinary academic teacher or </seg>

knowledge of the science of education and the art of teaching, 
and undoubted skill in applying them. Hence none but pen

in our State Normal schools. And the services of BUch cannot

REPORT OF THE 

NEBRASKA INSTITUTE FOR THE BLIND, NEBRASKA CITY, NEB, 

J. B. Parmelek. Pkiscii-a 

Ehe Institute for tbe Blind has experienced a steady and sattorv 
growth during the biennial term ,ju3t closed. The 
attendance has increased from 21 to 25 and the efficiency 
ie departments has been materially advanced. 

E'he older pupils have been given a course in higher matheics, 
(algebra and geometry) and have proved themselves 
apable of mastering the intricacies and difficult work 
&gt;lved, though the work must of necessity be entirely mental. 

A i , I Ml ofanatomical modeli for study in physiology, a tellurian 
and planetariani for use in astronomy, philosophical 
.¦•at u- 1. &gt;r natural philosophy besides tuapt and charts in relief 
been provided. 

Ebject teaching, a great desideratum in any school, is doubly 
able here. 

With scarcely an exception the pupils receive instruction in 
J or instrumental music, or both, and considerable talent is 
i developed among them by the training given. We have 
two pianos and two orgMM in constant use, and two choirs meet 
daily for vocal instruction. 

The industrial department has received a fresh impetus in the 
last year. Our brooms bring the highest market price, and all 
repair work in cane seating of the city furniture stores is sent 
iir w^rk shop. 

Two or more hours per day are devoted to this work by each 
pupil. 

The department lias been self-sustaining fur several years 

Eur list of officers, besides principal and matron, includes four 
hers, two of whom, however, devote only part of their time 
ie work. 

Kur appropriations for the past two years have been $4,000 
living expenses and $2,600 for salaries each year. The ex- 
ee per capita per Year has been about $250. </seg>

There is another matter to which I wish to direct your at

to thisschool foradmission of feeble-minded children. In two 
I the applicants were admitted and tried, but were sent borne 
as unfit subjects. Thej are growing up without any care or 
instruction. I have written the Governor with reference to the 

matter, and suggest that the time has arrived to provide for this 
class of children in Nebraska. If it is thought too soon to organize 
an independent institution, I suggest that a building be 
erected and a school be started as a branch of one of the existing 
institutions, this one or any other, till such time as it can stand 
alone. I wish, if you think this worthy of consideration, you 
would make mention of it in such manner as you see fit. Dr. 
Mathewson, of the Insane Hospital, has had many similar applications. 
While this class of children may not make the best 
class of citizens, yet in many cases they may lie made self-supporting, 
and in every case their condition may be very much 
ameliorated, and that of course is the aim of the project.

OMAHA PUBLIC 6C11OOLS. 

H. SI. James, Supkrintkndknt 

The schools of Omaha aru under the control of the Board i 
Education, composed of six members. These are chosen at lar&gt;:&gt; 
irrespective of wards, for a term of two years, one-half bein 
chosen each year. This board has entire jurisdiction over th 
course of study, all school funds, real estate, construction o 
buildings and school management. One member is employed 
part of the time to perform the duties of secretary and supply 
agent, and is paid a salary. A superintendent is also employed 
who devotes his entire time to the supervision of the work of instruction. 


The growth of the Omaha schools has been very rapid. The 
enrollment for the year ending June, 1880, was 3,517. In the 
year ending June, 1882, it had reached 4,550. The average attendance, 
which for the year 1879-80 was 2,310, last year was 
2,901. During the months of September and October of 1882 
it was 3,513. Such an increase has made lar&lt;re and constant demands 
of the Board of Education. There has been on their 
part an earnest endeavor to provide suitable accommodations for 
all who desired to attend the schools, yet it has been difficult to 
make this provision as promptly as the necessities have required. 
Two years ago the board owned sittings for about 2,800 pupils. 
In June last they had increased this number to about 3,500. 
Buildings now nearly completed will so increase this room that 
eoon there will be ample accommodations for all. 

The board now owns ten school-houses, upon which the peopl 
may look with justifiable pride. More beautiful, convenient am 
durable structures have been provided by few cities in this coun 
try. Of the seventy-four school rooms, all but six are in pernia 
nent brick buildings, and all of them are commodious and sub 
etantial structures, first-class in almost every respect. 

This provision of new school rooms has made it possible to 
reduce the size of the large schools. Some of these have been 
greatly overcrowded, in a lew cases the number being so laru'e</seg> 

            <seg id="p052">
hi 


IX it has been necessary to resort to the half day plan. The 
ird now employs seventy-four regular teachers, and a teacher 
elocution, who gives four hours a week to the five higher 
,des of the schools. In addition to these, two teachers are 
ployed through the winter in an evening school to give ini 
"tion in the elementary branches to such youth of school age 
i;ile and female — as cannot attend during the day. 

The course of study which covers a period of twelve years is 
modern and progressive. It aims to combine a practical edinatiou 
with the best possible culture. It strives to give to those 
vrbo complete the whole or only a part of.it, the best preparation 
possible, under the circumstances, for the duties and responsibilities 
of life. For those whose school life is limited to one 

or t»vo years, it provides a severely practical course, while those 
win) puss through the high school receive a liberal English edu-l 
and a thorough preparation for admission to colleges of 
the highest grade. 

Iriie rapid growth of the high school during the last few years, 
rme of the most gratifying features of the Omaha schools. 
it the excellent management of the present principal, Mr. 
1&gt;. Hine, the standard of scholarship has been advanced, and 
numbers have been largely increased. The membership is 
•\ aliout 140, and an unusually large class is preparing to en- 
Ttn8 department next year. The present encouraging outk 
for this part of the school system is full of promise. 

I 'he revenue of the schools is ample and under the present 
s it must continue to be more than enough for current de- 
tids. The amount derived from fines and licenses alone is 
icient to meet all ordinary expenses. The board has au- 
rity to make a direct tax as high as one per cent, of the tax- 
¦ property of the city, but it has not been necessary to raise 
his way more than enough to. pay the interest on existing 
da, and to provide for the sinking fund. The rate of taxa- 
for school purposes is accordingly very low, yet the school 
1 is sufficient lor ail purposes. </seg>

The board is inclined to pay good salaries and be generous in 
making all needful provision for the schools. The regular salary 
for teachers of experience is $700 a year, while principals and 
teachers in the high school receive more. While high salaries 
will not make good teachers, they may procure them. Believing 
that more important than fine school-houses or complete apparatus, 
the skillful and devoted teacher is the chief element of success 
in a school, the board is desirous of obtaining the beat 
teachers that can be found. With the material facilities now at 
hand, a body of thoroughly qualified teaehen can maintain in 
Omaha an excellent system of schools.

We adopted a new course of stndr, which differs somewhat from 

the one tnat bad formerly been their guide, and organized under it. 

There are two grades below the high school department, 

two classes in each tirade; by this arrangement we are enabled 

rade; by 

to grade our pupils much more closely than with a less ¦amber 

of class 

All pupils are required to take the same studies until they 

reach the last two years of the course of study, then they have 

four courses from which they can choose. Those desiring to 

prepare for college, either in the classical or scientific course, are 

fitted to enter almost any of the higher institutions of learning 

as each course is as broad as the schools that prepare for entrance 
into Eas.ern colleges. Those who do not wish to devote

r time to the rtadj of the languages, can take the English 
or scientific course, which gives them English classics, history 
book-keeping, civil government, etc; however nearly all our advanced 
pupils take Latin or German ami many both. 

During the year 1881. the Board of Education had erected in 
tl First Ward a four room building, and in 1882 another of the 
same size in the southwestern part of the city. Both are beautiful 
buildings and either would be an ornament to any city. They 
¦ together aomething over 920,000. 

The high school building and the two ward buildings are 
1 liv .-team. Our schools are crowded, but when we are 
provided with another building M large as one of tho.se recently 
built, no city can boast of better school facilities. 

I^or the accommodation of eight or nine hundred pupils the 
h school grounds wen found inadequate, and we concluded to 
&gt;pt the " no recess " plan. The results have been more satistory 
than we anticipated and we commend it to other cities 
an impartial trial. In numbers, our schools are growing at 
rare of about three hundred a year. I think it will be safe

The schools have made substantial and gratifying progress 
since the last biennial report. The course of instruction has 
been broadened and diversified by the introduction everywhere, 
of new matter; the tone of school manners elevated ; the standard 
of deportment raised ; the amount ot personal effort required 
of the pupils increased, and the style of teaching work groat 
]y elevated. Methods that have stood the test of full trial, have

The teaching force embraces nine teachers and a superintendent, 
who is principal of the high school. The government is 
firm and punctilious, but rarely employes other than moral 
forces. The Board of education has been very efficient and fully 
seconded all the enterprize of the Superintendent and teachers. 
The result is we have marked progress and very general satisfaction 
with the condition of the schools.

Our first school began in 1869, and in 1871 a frame school 
house was erected at a cost of $3000.00. The school consisted 
of two departments from 1872 to 1877, when a third was added. 
By 1878 there were so many pupils that the Board rented a 
room and employed another teacher. The people now began to 
talk of a new school-house, and in 1879, bonds were voted for 
this purpose. During the year a two story brick (besides the 
basement) was built and furnished at a cost of $15000.00. The 
building is in every wav a model sceool-house. In 18S0, this 
building was occupied and the work of grading the school was

E aw nee City Academy was opened Oct. 30, 1877, with four 
lents. Since that time between two hundred and three hun-1 
students have received instruction in the school. During 
past year there has been an attendance of seventy-nine stuts. 
The first class, eight in number, graduated June 23d, 

There are two courses of study, each of two years ; the first, 
or "preparatory," including the subjects in which candidates for 
teachers' second grade certificates must be prepared ; the second 
MUM extends two years beyond this, thus making a four years' 
OMUM of study before graduation. The school is not in any 
sense primary, the grade haying been kept as high as possible. 

Music, both vocal and instrumental, is taught, and in addition 
to the regular courses, there has been presented for the current 
year a course of lectures on physiology and hygiene by a resident 
physician. 

Eie school is entirely under the control of the Principal, A.

of this class is rhetoric, original composition, elocution, algebra,

We would wish to add one every year to this course as well as 
to the regular collegiate, till complete; but under existing circumstances 
do not see much prospect for the immediate realization

help in advancing teachers' wages. Results may be obtained 

also in establishing good circulating libraries

Prof. Barber, of &lt;Jrand Island, presented hi- paper on thu 

spelling reform. After alluding to the defects of our present 

method of spelling, he said too much time must be given to learn 

spelling in the present form; that it costs too much money. A 

from well known educators was produced to 

mass ot testimony 

how that much less time is consumed by children in learning 

the languages of continental Europe than is needed by our English 
speaking children in learning their own. In answer to the 

i 

jection that phonetic spelling would break up the historic con- 

said it is not the province of spelling to

preserve the etymology of the language 

In answer to the objection that so much literature would be 

iestroyed, he said tiiat no violent change need be made; no dif- 

ficulty need arise in distinguishing words with the same sound,

While a phonetic system is to be the object aimed at, time
