Corey, of the Iowa State Fair. As he was unable to be present with us, we have requested Ex-Governor A. C. Shallen - berger to give us a few remarks this afternoon. We will now listen to him. By A. C. SHALLENBERGER: Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen: I c.ime down here to lunch today and Mr, Jackson, your very efficient Secretary came to me and asked me to fill this sudden engagement lo talk to you this afternoon. I told him I had an appointment with the dentist In a short time, so I might stand a little longer misery and perhaps I could whistle through these teeth so you could under - stand me. I am. like you gentlemen, so much interested in fairs and Agriculture that I cannot pass any opportunity to be of service so I am very glad, indeed, to come here and talk to you in the absence of Mr. Corey. I have known Mr. Corey for about thirty-five years— since I began about that long ago to show at the Iowa State Fair I was showing dogs before I ever showed cattle. I asked Mr. Jackson what he wanted me to talk about as I was already scheduled to talk at your banquet tonight. I have found it is a very dangerous thing to talk twice in one day to the same audience. Mr. W. J. Bryan impressed that fact upon my mind one time. Comment was frequently made on how he could make so many speeches in a given time. He said, a speaker does not give the same oid speech over and over again. In his 189G campaign he made 315 speeches but what he said he really did was to make the same one 816 times— but he always changed it a little every time he delivered t. It was understood with the newspapers that they should not pub - lish the story except what he wanted to tell them. Mr. Bryan then told me of an incident that happened to Senator Stone in one of his campaigns. "Gumshoe" started out in his campaign by making a set speech at each place where he went, giving the same old speech each time. At Moberly, or some such place, there sat an old gentleman at the front who seemed to give the address very close attention He came up later and assured Senator Stone that was a great speech— a very finished speech. At his next point for a meeting, some distance away, he saw in amazement the same old man on the front bench and as he only had one speech he realized he must change his speech </seg>
            <seg id="p011">JIEPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE so when he arose he threw away his introduction, then he threw away his peroration and changed his speech all he could. Then to his sur - prise the old man came forward and inquired, Where are you going to make your next speech? Stone told him the location of the next meeting, something like 100 miles away thinking that was too far away for him to see the old man again. Again he went out and there eat the old man. Remembering then an old free silver speech, he threw away his old speech and his new speech and delivered this old free silver speech. The old man came tearing up and said, "Colonel, I never saw a man who could deliver so many new speeches; I never saw a man in my life before who could give a new speech every night." Then Stone answered, "I will make my next speech in Hell and I hope you will be on the front seat and hear it." I am. not going to get in that position today so as to embarrass myself tonight, so this talk must be very brief. You men are inter - ested in agriculture. The fairs of the state are the show windows for agriculture. It 1b here that we farmers and stock raisers put our wares on exhibition. Nebraska fairs pull in more people than they did twenty years ago. Nebraska is more dependent on agriculture than any state in the Union. There is not another state like Nebraska in this respect. It doesn't produce a pound of coal, iron or minerals of any kind. There are no forests where we can cut lumber in Ne - braska. We value our trees so much for their beauty and utility that we will not cut them. Our wealth is entirely taken from the soil. We only have around a million and a quarter people. But the statistical records of the Government show we produce more actual wealth according to our population than other states, standing now fifth among the States of the Union in the amount of wealth we dig out of the soil each year — in fact, really fourth in rank. Iowa, Illinois and Texas being the only states ahead of us. Those three states have many times our population so when it comes down to a measure of the results a greater value according to its population, in the results dug out of the soil, and that ought to be so. One of the most remarkable situations in our nation is that the men who con - trol our government don't come from the great centers of trade and population; not from Pittsburgh, Chicago, New York or Philadelphia, but they come from the rural states — they come from the average condtions surrounding the American people. My explanation of that is that in the great centers of population men struggle to attain great wealth or power and forget to strive for the things that most at - tract and satisfy the soul. But close to the soil another class of men strive to gain things more satisfying. In Nebraska, agriculture is the greatest thing we do so it employs the very best of our efforts, our planning and our study. The best men we produce are those who devote their time toward agriculture. My father -was born on a farm in Western Pennsylvania and came out to Illinois and spent his life, and became the father of </seg>
            <seg id="p012">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE eight children. I remember how my good father talked to his children about what they should do. One thing he urged them to concentrate upon whatever they were going to do; take one thing and do it the best they could.. Just to illustrate the point, I knew of one colored man, they call them a "nigger" down in Virginia to whom another inquired Sam, how do you get such an exquisite bow" referring to his tie and the other nigger said, "I just put my whole mind on it." It is so with a farm; when you put your whole mind on it and devote your attention strictly to the task you produce the best results. That is what we are doing here in Nebraska. We have had to go through some disturbances in all lines of agriculture. Stock breeders and feeders sustained the first blow and suffered almost the worst of any line. I have been a cattle breeder almost all of my life and we had to take the blow and the set-back but the cattle business has begun to turn, to come out the other end and Is on the upward trend now. They are beginning to make some money, and so it will be with other businesses on the farm- so agriculture is coming on ah up-grade now. It may be a good thing in the end that we have passed through this speculative wave All of this vast stream of money that has been turned into stock spec - ulation may return to agricultural production and ordinary businesses and be returned to channels where It should finally be used, so in the end the final result may be a good thing for the whole country We have been on the down-side and these other people way up in the ascendancy. Now the condition of the country has largely altered so we are getting on a proper level again. We have found a proper basis and as we begin to start up we can go up together on a basis that should be permanent. Prices took a spree in the cattle business the same as they did in other lines and went up to two or three times what they should have been - then went down, and now they have come back to about a proper level. I might cite an instance that illustrates what happened to many in this industry. I had a man who worked for me for a number of years. I took him in the same as a partner. We operated together for five years. The War came on and values went up until finally the War was over and he solicited me to buy him out, and paid him $20,000.00. He had started In with $3,000.00. He in - voiced his interest in at $20,000.00 and bought a farm at that price and sold it for $40,000.00. The neighbors talked about how this young man had worked for me for nine years at $50.00 a month and by this wonderful transition had become worth $40,000.00. Then the bottom went out of agriculture and things went down the same as the stock market recently came down,, so in the place of that man being worth that much it developed when he sold it he had taken a contract, with $2,000.00 down— so in place of my former employee being worth $40,000.00 all he had left in his dealings was $2,000 00 </seg>
            <seg id="p013">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE An he had given an agent $ 1,200.00 commission, all he really got out of the whole series of deals was ¥800.00. He was just about back ■where he started from. So was I. I thought I was worth a lot of money, but when it was all over, I was back where I originally began, but I had my cattle — I had my land and in the end I was worth as much as I was before. We are coming forth on a sound basis now. We can begin to look forward into the future and feel we are standing on solid ground. Now I want to talk for a few moments about your particular effort — that is, the development of our fairs. I have been showing in County Fairs almost longer than anybody in Nebraska. There are many interesting things in regard to fair work we might talk over this afternoon, but in the few minutes I can spend with you it may be that one of the most interesting to you might be a recital of how we secured the attendance of -the President of the United States at the International Stock show when they were celebrating their twenty-fifth anniversary. It was the first time that a President of the United States ever honored a great stock show or fair with his presence. I may also be able to give you a little idea of how these things operate in Congress. The International Stock Show, a great fair has reached the time when it was twenty-flve years old. They conceived the idea of getting a gold and silver medal issued by the Government at Washington, and giving those to whoever won first prizes. So Mr. Heide, the manager and John Clay and some others came down to Washington to try and get legislation to have the United States Government make an appropriation for such a medal. They couldn't get anything out of ihe proper committee in the way of a bill that would authorize that thing. So Mr. Helde came to me, as he knew me as a farmer and showman and asked me if I wouldn't try to get $1,000.00 for such a purpose. He thought it might take $5,000.00. The Chairman of the Appropriations Committee was Mr. Magee of Syracuse, New York, now dead. Martin B, Madden, also now deceased, a great man from Illinois, was then Chairman of the important Committee on Appropria - tions. I told him what we wanted, and we concluded it could best be accomplished by an amendment to the Appropriations Bill auth - orizing, the Government to provide the medal desired. It is pretty difficult to get such an enactment through for by rule of Congress relating to an appropriation, if one person of the 435 members should object it kills the consideration of the matter. 8 We found a place where there had been offered an amendment for $50,000.00 for the support of expositions. To that we wanted to offer an amendment whereby $1,000.00 of that money could be used for this explicit purpose. Mr. La Guardia, the man who recently ran for Mayor in New York City was one of the chief objectors of the House. Both parties have a few men on each side of the House who are constantly watching these bills for such amendments and measures that drain </seg>
            <seg id="p014">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE upon the public treasury. So I went to Mr. La Guardia and told him what we wanted to get and why we wanted It and asked him to forego any objection. We got Mr. Madden to go and see some of these other regular objectors and I went to some of the men on the democratic side who might be likely to object and we got the setting fixed so the bill could be passed. We succeeded in getting further support from the Bureau of Budgets and the Secretary of Agriculture, and tried to get letters from them to recommend that this be done. I had It pretty well lined up so then I wanted to make a little speech because there was a certain thing I wanted to say. I wanted to em - phasize that this would call upon the people to support these great fairs and expositions because every other nation had so recognized them. So I told Mr. Magee I wanted five minutes to talk for the amendment; he said, if you can get through in five minutes you can have the five minutes. He warned me not to prolong that period or someone would object. My purpose was to show this country had not properly recognized expositions and fairs. I . told what Great Britain had done, that the King of England visited their great ex - position every year part of a day; that the Prince of Wales had es - tablished a great breeding ranch in Canada. The United States gov - ernment had never recognized the great Exposition at Chicago. In the course of that talk I said it would be a great thing if the Pres - ident of the United States governing these states should recognize this institution and visit the Agricultural Exposition at Chicago. This casual suggestion seemed to take root; they voted the $1,000 Item. In a day or two later a letter came from the Editor of the Country Gentleman, published- by the Curtis people wanting me to write an article on the situation as to the great Cattle Show. I hadn't even paid enough attention to the speech to take it from the Congressional Record or get a copy of it, that would cost twelve cents. I hadn't even cared enough about it to spend the twelve cents, but I bought a copy then. Then I thought I will put a little of this into that article. I would take some extra and work in to the article, espec - ially where I had said, the President of the United States should recognize that show and visit it. He came back the next day and accepted the article. He also gave me a nice check which was unexpected. It was then suggested that I follow up that sugges - tion but I demurred and Btated I thought the officers of the Inter - national Show should extend the invitation. While Mr. Heide and Mr. John Clay were right on the job and offered to pay my expenses for me to go and try to get the President to come out to Chicago. I had to write them that I was running for office and had my hands full right then, as it was pretty hard to elect a Democrat in my region I must attend to business. The next thing I got a letter from one of the officers who said he had taken the article down to the Presi - dent, Calvin Coolldge, who read it. He was then having trouble with the farmers and to everyone's surprise said, "If they will invite me, I will be glad to do It." I wired Mr. Helde that they should take the </seg>
            <seg id="p015">REPORT OB" NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE matter up and immediately he and Mr. Clay launched forth to ex - tend the invitation and they secured its acceptance. Mr. Heide said it had been a great thing for them ever since. The city people came out to see the show when the President was there. This little thing so advertised th*e great International Live Stock Show that they have l&gt;ut me in a box ever since and will not let me pay. I tell this story to point out how important it is we have our fairs properly adver - tised here in Nebraska and secure appreciation for the great work you men are doing in this field. We are spending millions of dollars there in Washington devoted to agricultural experts.- You have good ex-perts in this University, yet the greatest agricultural expert in the world is the farmer him - self upon his own farm, developing these things in a practical way. Then where does; he display the results of his work? His place lor display, his laboratory is the Fair or Exposition; there he shows what he has done for us and for Agriculture and how he has developed agriculture. I am glad that the State of Nebraska has built up here one of the greatest fairs in the United States and I can also say with pride that Mr. Jackson has become recognized as one of the great fair men of the nation. That thing in my judgment goes further than anything else we have to advertise agriculture and the greatness of the State of Nebraska. It is a remarkable thing to be a great scientist, but a man can achieve a lasting record in humble service. There was a man, Thomas Bates, who was a great farmer in Great Britain. He became a great breeder of cattle on his own efforts. At a banquet in that country given by some notable man Thomas Bates made a speech. A great man was in attendance, a member of the Cabinet and Parliament. When Thomas Bates finished this same man, who had never heard of him before, spoke to Earl of Spencer and inquired who he was; upon being informed he was a great cattle breeder in Durham, Spencer said, "that man ought not to be spending his time fooling with cattle; that man could become a great statesman, perhaps even Prime Minister." But perchance we may recall that since then there have been many men serve as Prime Minister whose names are now forgotten. But Thomas Bates will be known forever — he made his fame as a man who gave the world a great breed of cattle, by which the world has benefited. I could talk to you for a long time-about my cattle, but I will not do so. You men are building fairs and deserve a lasting credit. I thank you very much indeed for listening to me. PRESIDENT LAMB: Mr. Shallenberger, we thank you very much for this talk and appreciate what you have Bald to us here. The next order of business will be to take up Nomination of Members of the State Board of Agriculture. Nominations were made from the floor as follows: </seg>

THE PRESIDKNT'8 ADDRESS It is the agreeable duty of the President to review the events of the past year and make such suggestions, born of his experience, that may be useful in determining future action. The second year of our eight day Pair was an unqualified suc - cess. The increased attendance and the equitable distribution of it over eight days instead of six enabled the people to see the Pair with greater comfort and see more of it. A tour through the buildings any day, with the possible exception of Labor Day, which is always a day of immense crowds, showed that people were taking more time to see the exhibits and enjoy the sights. I believe we can consider the eight day Fair a fixed institution so long as the conditions under which the Pair is held remain as they are. The members of the Board, the heads of departments and the people who made up the big Fair crowd placed a large seal of ap - proval on the new grandstand. It proved its value and usefulness </seg>
            <seg id="p017">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE in one year, not only by the space it provided for exhibitors and the increased comfort it gave to those who sat in its seats, but In the added prestige it gave the Fair itself in the eyes of its owners— the people of the state. The planning, labor and expense which the grandstand cost are already Justified by the earnings of the structure itself and the substantial assurance its solid walls give that the Ne - braska State Pair is a permanent institution. It is a matter of pride to us all that the Nebraska State Fair takes such high rank among the state fairs of the nation The attendance at our Fair last fall exceeded the attendance at any like fair in the country and exceeded its own high marks. This means that the Nebraska State Fair is achieving fame abroad and becoming a more and more important institution to the people of our own state. We have striven hard to attain this recognition and I feel sure we have justly achieved it. I look for a continued increasing interest in our Fair, shown In better exhibits and larger attendance for Nebraska is rapidly developing and its people are coming better to know the extent and value of its great developed and undeveloped resources. The State Department of Publicity, which is operating under an enactment of the last legislature and is under the direction of our Board, with a Director and an Assistant chosen by its members, has begun a work that, in my judgment, will be of. immense value to this state. The Department has adopted a program of disslminating In - formation about Nebraska through the state press and other med - iumB. We have long needed such a Department. It is fortunate, I think, that It was associated with the Nebraska State Board of Agri - culture, because its connection there removes it from political con - trol, enables the Director to map out a continuous program and gives the benefit of a close contact with another department of publicity that Is performing a great work In making Nebraska known to its citizens and the outside world — the Nebraska State Fair. In surveying the accomplishment of 1929 I feel a deep sense of gratitude for the unselfish work of the members of the Board of Managers, members of the State Board, Superintendents, heads of departments and all others connected with the Fair in executive po - sitions whose well directed, intelligent effort made the 1929 Fair a success. The press of Nebraska, always liberal with space and generous in its treatment of the Fair, the Extension Department of the State University, the Lincoln Chamber of Commerce, the railroad companies whose lines enter Lincoln, all deserve our generous appreciation for cooperation given. • It is our fixed policy never to look back with pride on. a past achievement, but to look forward to a greater success yet to be attained. And so I am looking for the Fair of 1930 to be the most outstanding milestone in our long and honorable career. With the </seg>
            <seg id="p018">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OK AGRICULTURE kind of cooperation that is our yearly pleasure to receive, I am sure the 1930 Fair will be the best in our history. PRESIDENT LAMB: We will now receive the report of Sec - retary Jackson. i ':'•■■ " ■ • . ■ ■ ; ; SECRETARY'S KEPORT FOR 1929 The years are fleeting by so quickly that it is difficult to determine where one year's business stops and another begins, but as we meet here today to review and record another year's business, It is with a great deal of satisfaction to know that our 1929 Fair was a success. Our financial report will show that our total receipts were $7,303.50 more than last year's Fair. However, We feel that It should have been much more than that. We had the distinction of having the largest attendance of any eight day State Fair In the United States — 437,660 In the eight days went through the gates — this is 10,624 more than last year. While this is true, yet the gate receipts of several Fairs totaled more than we received. However, Minnesota charges seventy-five cents at the main gate, we charge fifty cents; many Fairs admit children free but one day, we admit them every day which alone would naturally Increase our free attendance several thousand. The matter of gate "receipts should be looked Into by the Incoming Board and endeavor to eliminate as near as possible, what seems to be the unavoidable leaks. It Is with a great deal of satisfaction that we may say that never in our experience have we had so much favorable comment come to our office as after the last Fair. Everyone was pleased, not only with the Fair in general, but in the service and conveniences. Toilets, shower baths, sleeping quarters, hospital service, drinking fountains, laundry, grocery store, post office, and I would be ungrateful Indeed If in passing I did not speak of the kindly words spoken by our pat - rons of the splendid service rendered by those at the gates and by the public safety department in handling the immense crowds. This comes to us by many unsolicited. There was no further evidence needed to demonstrate to us that service paid in building up a big Fair as well as establishing a big business. The Nebraska State Fair has developed gradually ever since its permanent home in Lincoln. It has kept up with the state's progress almost unnoticed. For illustration, let us see what has been done in the last five years in the way of permanent improvements. In 1925 we did away with the Boys Camp where we now have the Camp Ground. At that time the 4-H Club organization ■ was In its infancy, but seemed to be developing very fast. After a great deal of thought, . the Board decided to put their energy into the 4-H Clubs and es - tablish a Camp Ground for our patrons where the Boys Camp had been. A few new cottages were built, trees set out and a new bridge </seg>
            <seg id="p019">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE built across the creek. In evidence of the popularity of the tented city, one only has to make it a visit any time during the week and you will be convinced that it is one of the most popular places on the Fair Grounds. • This same year we received an appropriation of $10,000 from the legislature for removing the rock and debris of the old Capitol Build - ing to the Fair Grounds. On account of the enormous expense of handling the large rock in the old capital building, many of them weighing four ton, the appropriation was soon absorbed and we were left without funds to handle the dirt which was needed to cover up the rock, but we made arrangements with the Capitol Coommlsslon to deliver the balance of the old building and dirt to the Fair Grounds, they to stand sixty per cent of the cost of transportation and we forty per cent. The amount due the Capitol Commission for this work was S5.977.04, which was appropriated by. the last session of the Legisla - ture. Practically the entire Capitol Building was dumped into the water hole north of the boys and girls club building, reclaiming, about two acres of very desirable land without cost to the Fair Association. In the spring of 1925 we made a contract with the Automobile Auditorium Association to erect a building 87x200 feet to be known and used as an automobile exhibit building, they to have full use and control of the building for a period of ten years, then to become the property of the state. In the spring of 1926 we made a similar con - tract in order to complete the building, this unit to run 9 years so the entire building would become the property of the state at the same time. The building complete is 300 feet long by 87 feet wide and cost $39,000. In five more years this building will become the property of the state. In 1925 we had for the first time what we call, "The Nebraska State Fair on Wheels," or the parade. This has developed to such an extent that it is one of the outstanding features of the Fair. In 1926 we made arrangements with the Chicago Stock Yards Company to exhibit their eight-horse hitch. It has proven a wonder - ful attraction and comes to us without cost, it has become one of the annual exhibits. We also established the Horse Pulling Contest for the first time which created lots of interest at the 1926 Fair. That same year the following new departments were established: Egg Show, Cat Show, Canary Bird Show, Spelling Contest and the Press Bureau. We built two new dining halls and four new toilets. In 1927 the Burlington Railroad built a side track on the out - side of the grounds making a very convenient unloading platform near the Agricultural Hall. We also constructed two more new din - ing halls. A class was made for High School bands for the first time and this contest is one of our big attractions. During 1928 several permanent improvements were made on the grounds consisting of one new dining hall, a new blacksmith shop. </seg>
            <seg id="p020">ItfcPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE toilet near the Speed Barns and several concession stands at various places on the grounds. This year the new grandstand, fence and tunnel was built by the debenture plan, costing $250,000, and we believe the additional grandstand receipts will take care of the payment or nearly so. A statement of the hasty procedure of this adventure might be of inter - est. About January 25th,. last year, we met with the Secretary of the Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Walter Whitten, for the purpose of work - ing out ways and means of financing a new unit to the grandstand. He at once called over representatives from several of the trust com - panies in Lincoln. They informed us that without question of doubt the new unit or a complete new grandstand could be financed, but advised us that it would be necessary to get a law passed authorizing us to proceed. The time had expired for the introduction of bills in the Legislature except by the Governor. After a conference with Governor Weaver, he kindly, consented to introduce the bill. We had the bill framed up and it was introduced at once. The bill provided that no part of the cost of the grandstand should ever be paid for by the state, but should be paid for from the grandstand receipts. In the building of this enormous structure we had the closest. cooperation of all concerned. Through the Influence of our members in the House and Senate and other interested members, the bill was put through without a dissenting vote. Bids were asked for and W. J. Assen - macher Company being the lowest bidder, the contract was let on the 20th of May and on August 25th the building was completed and ready for the Fair. We also built one new dining hall and three concession booths from the Fair receipts, the legislature appropriated $6,000 for a new residence for the Superintendent of Grounds. In the future development of the Nebraska State Fair it is going to require more organized intelligent thought than ever before, be - cause we are living in an age of broad vision. Startling changes are taking place in agriculture, farms are becoming larger, tractors are taking the place of the horses, motor trucks are doing the hauling, farmers are keeping books and. studying new methods of manage - ment, scientific research is taking on new life, farmers are demanding bigger and better tools, better seed and better ways, they are culling their flocks, testing their cows, treating their seed, having better homes, better crops and better live stock. The State Fair is looked to for advanced information and Is regarded as the one place where the latest in everything may be seen. We must be able to visualize and carry the flag at the head of the procession of the states' progress. The 1929 Nebraska State Fair was visited by people from all corners of the United States, its influence is felt in every part of our country, in evidence of this fact, our records show that forty-four' states and Canada were represented as well as the ninety-three count - ies in the state.

STOCK YARDS TEAM Those six hitch teams of the Chicago and the Omaha Stock Yards were again a feature of the Fair program. The fine animals so evenly matched, so superbly groomed and so skillfully handled and driven never failed to excite expressions of admiration whenever they appeared. In their stalls the horses were visited by admiring thous - ands. HORSE PULLING CONTEST The flnest looking team is not the best pulling team, this has been demonstrated many times at the Pair. Many owners of good teams bring them to have their pulling ability tested for their own satisfaction and this results incidentally in some keen contests. A good attendance during the contests showed this to be a popular de - partment of the Fair. CATTLE • A larger number of both beef and dairy cattle were shown. The beef cattle comprised 567 head and the dairy cattle 400 head. These numbers did not include the baby beeves and the dairy calves of the 4-H Club members. The show was characterized by a much larger number of Nebraska exhibitors. The great bull of former Governor A. C. Shallenberger, which was the grand champion of the show, had made an amazing record as a junior, and is now sweeping the stock shows of the middle west as a senior. Red Polled and Polled Short - horns were especially numerous in the exhibit. The 400 head of dairy cattle drew thousands of interested spec - tators. Dairying is a rapidly developing Industry in Nebraska. HOGS The total of 1,902 hogs were shown which did not include the 600 hogs shown at their own club building by the 4-H Club members. Poland China, Duroc Jersey, Chester White, Spotted Poland and Hampshire breeds each had their representatives and their interested champions. The superintendent was delighted with the enlarged dis - play and said it showed the increased interest in better hogs through - out the entire state. SHEEP AND GOATS A greater interest in sheep is observed in the state and this was reflected in the increased display of animals at the Fair. The milk - ing goat class was much larger than in any former year. Goat milk </seg>

Between 1,600 and 1,700 birds were on display. The exhibit was on par with the excellent poultry shows at the Fair in years past. BABBITS Ordinarily the rabbit exhibit could be dismissed with a sentence, but not this year. There were 420 entries by 68 exhibitors from Ne - braska and several surrounding states. Nebraska Rabbit and Cavy Breeders Association members held their annual meeting on the grounds and 100 breeders attended. There is immense interest in rabbits and fur bearing animals over the state. This accounts for the enlarged show. AGBICUIiTUKAIj EXHIBIT Nebraska is, above all else, an agricultural state. From the land is derived her great wealth, so the products of the soil constituted one of the largest and most Interesting displays on the grounds. Agricultural Hall with its beautiful decorations, its fine exhibit of flowers so tastefully arranged and its fountain spraying the heated air with refreshing coolness, was a place of enchantment for the thous - ands who flocked to it and found it one of the most interesting places on the grounds. Seventeen counties — Lancaster,. Merrick, Box Butte, Red Willow, Polk, Kimball, Dawson, Richardson, Thayer, Washington, Phelps, Douglas, Custer, Adams, Kearney, Clay and Holt — were splendidly represented by composite county exhibits. Artistic skill of no mean degree was shown by the master minds that conceived the designs and the skilled hands that brought forth the finished work. Every de - partment of agriculture showed the effect of a good year in Nebraska and the competition was keen in every class. If I criticize the county agricultural exhibits anywhere, it would be in the fact that there was too much sameness and nothing special in many of the exhibits. I wish to recommend to the Board that we cither put in the premium list a separate classification for exhibits featuring special activities in their counties or request that they em - phasize one activity for which their county is famous and build around this. 1929 NEBRASKA CROP REVIEW Nebraska's crops are valued at $346,915,000 as compared with $326,666,000 last year, according to final figures on this year's crop by the State and Federal Division of Agricultural Statistics, This </seg>

The crop season was rather unfavorable for a time but soon changed and the early prospects of a poor wheat crop, later turned into a most promising condition which remained until within two weeks of harvest and finally ended in a disappointment. The oats harvest followed soon after the wheat with an excellent crop.

In spite of a fairly short crop, the growers exhibited more fruit than. in the three or four previous years. The quality was very good though the color was not quite as good as in some years since the growing season was about a week behind time. The Nurserymen's Association contributed a feature that was both attractive and educational. It was a back yard arranged with borders of shrubs and trees and a garden seat at one end a crystal gazing ball at the other. Each specimen of tree and shrub was labeled with the common name and the botanical name. The amateur flower exhibit was not quite as large as last year nor was the quality as good. The exceedingly hot, dry weather Just preceding the State Fair was responsible for this. BEES AND HONEY "The Sweetest Exhibit on the Grounds" the exhibit card said and it was.

The exhibit as a whole allowed great improvement and a number of new types of work was noticed. Some of the oil and pastel of older style of work was displaced by arts and crafts. Considerable advance has been made in hand made pottery, original composition and exquisite colors and design in batik. EDUCATIONAL DEPARTMENT The Educational Department is doing its best to maintain the slogan of the Nebraska State Fair— "Bigger and Better than Ever " It has outgrown its allotted space to such a degree that more room must be provided for this year. The Vitalized Agriculture display— new for 1929— promises to be much larger for the coming year. Small as it was, it proved to be the center of much interest and discussion on the part of Fair visitors. The manual training display, which grows larger each year, con - tained many pieces of unusual excellence and won many expreBslons of approval. Every year we have new counties represented in the purely acad - emic displays and more and more city and town schools are sending in their own exhibits which increases the competition and stimulates to more careful selection of material.

HIGH SCHOOL BAND CONTEST Interest in this department, increases and better bands are being developed thereby. Liberal prizes, the opportunity of the members to see the Fair as guests of the management and the spirit of friend - ly contests between towns in the several classes, produce a condition which makes for the growth of this department. BABY DEPARTMENT Who isn't interested in the baby contest? This year the interest was very keen. Richard Alvln, son of Mr. and Mrs. Eldon Noble of Lincoln, was the grand champion boy and Naomi Ruth, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Leo R. Rikll of Murdock, was the grand champion. baby girl. Large crowds watched the judging of- the babies each morning of the contest. 4-H CLUB WORK Ask any person who has truly seen the Nebraska State Fair, "What is the most Important department of the Fair?" and he is sure to answer— the boys and girls club work. That is true, for this department outshines any of the others in interest, enthusiasm and accomplishment. The 667 baby beeves, the 850 pigs, the 211 dairy calves, together with their owners and the exhibits in other departments of club work filled the big building, bulged the aides, sprung the roof and over - flowed onto adjoining Jand, demonstrating again that a bigger and better building for 4-H Club work is the crying need of the Fair. These enterprising youngsters also displayed their prize poultry in the poultry building. The U. S. Department of Agriculture had a carload of exhibits for this department, giving ten lessons in farming which not only the 4-H Club members took great interest in, but many others as well. Thirty-two boys and the same number of girls entered the annual health examination contest and were examined by a staff of twelve doctors and dentists. The winners in the health contest were intro - duced to the patrons at the grandstand on Wednesday evening. Frances Axtell of Jefferson county and Milton Gustafson of Phelps county, were judged the healthiest girl and boy. They represented their state in the National Health Contest of 4-H Clubs in Chicago, in December. Twenty-three girls participated in the style show and displayed their handiwork in a style revue before the grandstand on Wednes - day evening of the Fair. The first award went to Roberta Hledik of Saunders county. </seg>
            <seg id="p029">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE In every department of 4-H Club work there was increased activity over last year and every other year. Club work is growing and the Nebraska Club members are looking forward eagerly to the time when their new building, designed for their exclusive use, will be ready for occupancy. . 4-H BABY BEEVES Six hundred twenty-seven baby beeves were shown in competition by the members of Nebraska 4-H Clubs. The grand champion was shown by Hitoshi Matsutani. This was the largest exhibit ever shown at the Pair. On Tuesday of the Pair the 400 and more animals went to the auction block and the result was the largest sale of baby beeves ever held in the United States and in the world. The animals brought an average of $16.25 per head. The grand champion sold for 35 cents a pound. 4-H DAIRY CALVES Two hundred eleven dairy calves were shown by the boys and girls representing all. the major breeds of dairy cattle. There are over 800 boys and girls enrolled in dairy calf clubs. In 1925 there were only 15 dairy calves exhibited at the State Fair, in 1928 there were 163 and this year 211. Dairying has come to stay in Nebraska. Why? Because no other state offers better opportunities for it than Nebraska. Pasture is plentiful. Western Nebraska has the native pasture and eastern Ne - braska has solved the pasture - problem with the coming of sweet clover. The acreage of that crop has increased 17 fold since 1920. Alfalfa hay is plentiful, Nebraska being first in acreage. Other feeds are plentiful. In fact, no other state has such a quantity of cheap and desirable feeds. Nebraska is in a position to defy all competition in dairying. STATE FAIR ON WHEELS The great event of the Fair each year is the grand parade held on Thursday in front of the grandstand. This year the parade ex - ceeded all parades of previous years. For more than an hour men and women, boys and girls, livestock, exhibits, automobiles, trucks and farm machinery passed before the grandstand giving a concise and marvelous picture of the resources of a great state. It was a won - derful event, epitomizing in one spectacle the varied factors that made the 1929 Fair a great success. One feature of the parade was the large number of Modern Woodmen drill teams in line, these were received by Major General Smith of the M. W. A., who came to Lin - coln for that purpose. </seg>
            <seg id="p030">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AUTOMOBILE EXHIBIT To thousands of people, the automobile display affords a wel - come opportunity to view the various makes and models. A great exhibit was provided this year, filling the spacious display . hall to capacity. Dealers represented said the interest was unusually keen. FARM MACHINERY The acreage devoted to the display of farm machinery was a place of great activity all during the Fair. "Bigger and better" was the comment of the superintendent. The interest farmers take in the machines designed to lighten and shorten their labor, justifies the labor and expense entailed in making the displays. RAILROADS The Burlington showed one of its large modern engines that caught the eyes of the mechanically minded. The Missouri Pacific had a very comprehensive showing of agricultural development along its lines. The Union Pacific had a historic exhibit consisting of sev - eral old coaches and sleeping cars that showed the wide difference in the comforts of train travel of "then and now." Some interesting relics and reminders of the early days of the plains were shown in the coaches. FOREIGN EXHIBITS Los Angeles county, California, Texas, and Canada, had well arranged displays of the grain and fruit resources of their sections. THE FISH EXHIBIT As in former years, the exhibits of fish made by the state in the special quarters provided for it, never failed to have its crowds of in - terested spectators daily. Through this exhibit and in other ways the people of this state are learning that Nebraska is hot an arid or semi-arid state, but contains 1,200 lakes well stocked with game fish of many varieties. The Game, Forestation and Parks Commission, now in charge of all Nebraska parks and state-owned lakes, had a very interesting exhibit showing a typical northwestern Nebraska scene with hills, waterfall, timber and verdure, all making a beautiful scene. The new transfer station of the Commission during this summer on the fair grounds for use In transferring fish from outside states to Ne - braska waters, and from Nebraska hatcheries to Nebraska waters and other states, was visited by many people. This building Is a perma - nent improvement of real value on the Fair Grounds. STATE INSTITUTIONS Many people who have never entered a Nebraska state Institution learned for the first time at the Fair, something about their work. </seg>
            <seg id="p031">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The .eventeen institutions were represented, each with an exhibit which .howed the handiwork of its inmates. These exhibits occupied the north side of the balcony in Agricultural Hall. Visitors found that these wards of the state who are willing to receive instruction w,, «° me , W l" qUalIfled ln ma °y arts and sciences taught in the institutional schools and Imparted by experienced Instructors. I) AIRY EXHIBIT Because of the originality shown in the display and the pains and labor expended to produce a comprehensive showing, the exhibit of the Nebraska State Dairymen's Association in Agricultural Hall was a place of great popularity. The Beatrice Creamery Company's butter moulded cow. "Beauty Girl," Nebraska's greatest producer of milk and also holder of the world's record for milk production, claimed the interested attention of thousands during the eight day show. ■ ■ * BANDS Besides the fourteen High School bands that were present to participate in the school band contest, music was furnished by the Elk a Band of Lincoln, the Chicago, Northwestern Railway Band from Chicago, the Post Office Band from Lincoln, and the DesDunes Colored Band with their entertainers from Omaha. The Farragut Drum Corps of Lincoln, regaled the crowds with martial music. BIRD SHOW The bird show was good and visited by hundreds of people in - terested In feathered songsters and beautiful plumage. CAT SHOW b . e &amp;tth annual cat snow Produced a total of 125 animals for exhibition. Eight states were represented in 84 classes. HORSESHOE TOURNAMENT Forty-eight contestants, some of them veterans of the Fair court entered the contest. Guy Uhlig of Cozad, won the championship for the fourth year. Howard Robinson, 1928 champion, was compelled to take second honors. Better courts, better playing conditions and larger attendance of spectators marked the tournament. THE NEW GRANDSTAND The people who attended the Fair were delighted with the new grandstand and amazed at its size. They knew in a hazy sort of way it was being built for their use. but had no conception until they had seen it, of its size, utility and architectural beauty. Besides furnish- </seg>
            <seg id="p032">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Ing comfortable seats for 12,500 people, from which to see and hear the programs before the stand, there are long rows of booths under - neath for displays, besides room for police, public safety, public ad - dress system, and numerous rest rooms and comfort stations. It was dedicated with a fine program a few evenings before the Pair opened. The structure is an outstanding one and gives to the Nebraska State Fair a distinction that is due it for being one of the largest and best state fairs in the United States. PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM The extension of the Public Address System and its mechanical improvement made it possible for all persons 'seated in the grand - stand to hear all the programs going on before it. As the crowds increase each year, it is necessary to use better means to reach them with programs- and announcements. The address system is now a necessity. USHERS The gentlemanly, courteous force of 104 ushers who waited on ilie immense crowds in the grandstand and bleachers were again Hi-Y club boys gathered from over the state. The boys and their 16 lead - ers were housed in the Lincoln Y. M. C. A., ate part of their meals in the Lincoln Hi-Y Building (only one in the country) and held assemblies for the discussion of educational, religious and moral sub - jects at the Lincoln High School. The boys, during their stay in Lin - coln, had a trip through the new state capitol and visited the state penitentiary and state museum at the university. Thirty-three towns were represented in the usher force. ' BETTER TRACK AND PROTECTION Building a new grandstand allowed for improving the race track. The track is now surrounded at least one-half way on the outside with a cement wall surmounted by a heavy iron fence. This reduces the danger from horses and automobiles leaving the track to crash into the crowds. The tunnel under the track leading from the grandstand to the quarter stretch also reduces, danger. Another result Is a bet - ter and faster track. HORSE RACING A good program of harness and saddle races was seen at the Fair this year. The section for Nebraska colts was well filled and some good racing stock introduced to admirers of swift horse flesh. A better and safer track ■ promoted interest in the races. The purses were liberal and the competition keen. AUTOMOBILE RACES On three afternoons automobile races were the thrilling sport on the oval. Fast time and a few accidents marked the events. En- </seg>
            <seg id="p033">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE closed by a cement wall and an Iron fence, the track allows faster speed and avoids danger. CIRCUS The Hagenbeck-Wallape Circus was again our grandstand attrac - tion. The afternoon program in front of the grandstand included automobile racing on Saturday. Monday and Friday of the Pair and horse racing on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, in addition the circus performance was put on in part. The evening performance consisted of the complete circus which Included the big wild animal feature for which the circus is famous. The evening program was concluded with spectacular fireworks. FAIR IS CliEAN The Nebraska State Fair has a reputation for being a clean Fair Games of all kinds as well as improper shows and questionable fea - tures are rigorously excluded. The management is determined that the young people who belong to the 4-H Clubs and all other young people who attend the Fair shall not be subjected to unclean or im - moral influences. In this attitude the State Fair is setting a good example for other State and County Fairs. The morale of Fairs is steadily improving through the operation of this policy. MIDWAY Again Wortham's Shows were the attraction on the Midway, giv - ing a good variety of entertainment of the carnival type. The shows of this company are characterized by order and cleanness. PRESS BUREAU For the fourth year the Press Bureau supplied news of the Fair to newspapers and the Associated and United Press. Through this agency a large amount of dependable news about the Fair was as - sembled and made available through the newspapers to the state and the surrounding states. The news service was in operation the full eight days of the Fair. CAMP GROUND It was fortunate the management provided more camping space for it was needed. The campers plot filled up early and the tented city was a busy place to the closing hour. The facilities of the camp are so complete that it has become a popular temporary home for hundreds of Nebraska families during the Fair. The friendships made there and the exceptional opportunity afforded to see the Fair all the way through by camping on the grounds, as well as the rapid extension of surfaced highways to all parts of the state, will compel additional camping space soon. It is coming to be an annual reunion a </seg>
            <seg id="p034">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE- BOARD OF AGRICULTURE for friends and relatives living In different parts of Nebraska to meet there for the week. PUBMC SAFETY This Public Safety force is organized to direct Fair visitors and assist them In any way to make the Fair more enjoyable to them. The men of this department performed a fine service, though the general public does not know the extent and personal character of their work. IiAW ENFORCEMENT The State Sheriff maintained headquarters on the grounds but found the Fair crowd so orderly that only two arrests were made on the grounds during the Fair. PARKING The parking problem has been reduced to a minimum by the orderly way In which the Public Safety men direct traffic. In the Immense acreage devoted to parking on the east side of the ground* a system there employed makes It safe for any person to leave his car and easy for him to find it and drive away. IN CONCLUSION A successful Fair is the result of no one person's planning and effort. It is the result of well directed team work — of people with capacity for certain tasks working together in perfect accord. The success of the 1929 Fair is a new proof of the efficacy of whole - bearted cooperation. A great many exacting duties fall on the Secretary which he could not discharge without the assistance of the members of the Board of Managers, whose loyal cooperation is gratefully acknowl - edged. I would be lacking appreciation if I did not mention the loyal aid of Morris Reichenbach, Superintendent of Grounds, who has never yet failed to have the grounds and buildings in complete readiness on the opening day. And last, but not least, I am indebted to the members of the office force for their Interests to remove from the Secretary the burden of detailed duties and give him more time for the larger duties of his position. And now, having reviewed the successful Fair of 1929 with de - serving pride, let us turn our thoughts to the Fair of 1930 and here and now pledge our efforts to make it the greatest Fair of all by our greater experience, our better planning and our more loyal efforts. </seg>

You will notice when I read the changes in Class A — Horse De - partment — we have four classes provided for, as well as Draft horses. We have eliminated two classes, Clydes and Shires. The money that has heretofore gone to them has been divided amongst the Percherons and Belgians. There will be only two draft classes this year on which premiums will be paid. The reason for that is, we have sufficient competition here to warrant continuing these divisions. ■ ' ■ ' . . ■ </seg>

            <seg id="p044">REPORT OK NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE An increase in premiums for this classification of 1352.00. By making the above changes in the - premiums, it will reduce the total amount offered for the Horse Department $16.00. You will thus notice that there is practically no change in the number of prizes, except in the amounts. In the mares, we allowed the group classifications to remain the same as they are now. No change was made there. Leaving the Percheron division, we went to the Belgians. Increases were made just as necessary to have them remain on a par with the other class. Fifth and sixth classes have not been given before, so we made the necessary changes to institute this addition of classes. Now turning to CLASS "B" — BEEF CATTLE Page 48 — Galloways; Page 50 — Polled Shorthorns; and Page 42 — Herefords, remain the same. On Page 48 — Galloways, an increase in the premiums for this classification of $164.00 makes a total offer - ing for the class of . $1,019-00. Red Polled all remain the same. Aberdeen Angue remain the same. Now turning to CLASS "B" — DAIRY CATTLE Increases in premiums for the Dairy Department totaling $600.00 is to be divided as follows, through the four classes, or dairy breeds. First: this is quite sweeping you will notice. A change not even attempted in other states in the Union, whereby we are going to have a policy a little stronger than we have before attempted. "All animals brought on the Fair Grounds must have a cer - tificate from a licensed veterinarian showing that the animal has passed the tuberculin test within a year." That has never before been asked for in the State of Nebraska. But as Nebraska has sought to clean up the entire state by area eradication we seem justified in making this requirement. Many good herds have refused to come here because we had no requirement of that sort and they don't want to take chances on con - taminating their herd. Another addition — "In the get of sire and produce of cow classes, only one entry will be accepted from any one sire or any one dam." Another addition to the rules: "Notice is hereby given that beginning with the 1931 fair, pro - auction requirements will be enforced for all dairy cattle and no ani - mal will be accepted for entry in either the open or state classes that does not qualify under the following standard. Cows that are four years or over must have completed a yearly record of not less than the following: </seg>

Females under 4 years of age must have qualified or their dams must have completed records of not less than the above requirements. For males, their dams must meet the requirements above or two daughters must have individually met them. Seven day official rec - ords will be accepted providing the fat produced multiplied by 30 is equal to the above requirements." "Records may be either, ( 1 ) official advanced registry or register of merit; (2) breed herd test (Guernsey, Jersey, Ayrshire, Holstein); or (3) dairy herd improvement association. Records made under 1 and 2 must be certified to by the official in charge for the breed asso - ciation if they have not already been published. Dairy herd improve - ment association records must be certified to by a signed statement of the state official in charge of dairy herd improvement association work from the state where the record was made." By MR. MILLER: Are there any questions with reference to this part of the report or these proposals? If there are, let's have them now, because this is sweeping and there will be many questions asked by the dairymen from outside states as to what it all means. I understand there is no state having ventured this far and we will be pioneers, but we feel it will bring about a wonderful improvement. Now the increase in premiums on dairy cattle in the four breed - ing classes, as I remarked before, will add $600.00. &gt; On Page 59 — Jerseys: Open class premiums remain the same, Nebraska classes to be increased $100.00.

Now we come to CLASS "F". I am going to ask Mr. Stewart to explain what ideas we have in reference to that class. MR. P. H. STEWART, Lincoln: I think I can best present and explain this report by reading this letter. Then I should perhaps make a few comments. January 18, 1930. State Board of Agriculture, Lincoln, Nebr. ■ Gentlemen: At your request we wish to present a general plan for a new type of Agricultural exhibit for the Nebraska State Fair, in addition to the type of individual sample and County collective exhibit which are now provided for in Class F. In general this new type of exhibit might be outlined as follows: 1. That these exhibits must develop the idea of county re - sources, it being particularly desired that one single outstanding product be selected and developed in the display. It is not desired that the display be made, up of a mass of miscellaneous exhibits. Such material may be used to a limited extent in decorations and booth trimmings. </seg>
            <seg id="p047">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 2. That these exhibits be arranged in standard booths 12 feet wide with appropriate side walls where desired. 3. That these exhibits be spaced among the county collective exhibits to provide variety and interest. 4. That no county be permitted to have both a county collective and a single resource or idea exhibit but that a choice must be made. 5. That prizes be awarded for these exhibits as follows: First, that the state be divided into regions with definite amounts offered in each region or section for each creditable exhibit on display; de - cision as to whether exhibit is creditable is to be in the hands of a judging committee of three. And further, appropriate prizes be awarded to the 10 best County exhibits rated by a judging committee of three on the basis of the score card attached hereto. In other words, each creditable exhibit would be paid as a premium, the amount designated for their section of the state and in addition all exhibits regardless of region, would be scored on their merit for additional prize money. 6. That the rules and regulations regarding the placing and removal of exhibits in Class F apply to this type of exhibit as well. In order to accommodate this type of exhibit, and from 15 to 20 might be reasonably expected for the 1930 Fair, it would be necessary to revise the individual and 'county collective class in Class P. It seems that some $150.00 might be saved on minor and unim - portant crops in Class F. Many more varieties are given credit under the collective score card than seems reasonable and wise from the standpoint of honesty, the development of Agriculture, and diversity of exhibits. It is believed that a committee could revise the score card as given on Page 121 of the 1929 Catalogue, to reduce the ex - tent of the County Collective exhibits some 20% by merely lowering the number of varieties of each crop required to score the full number of points alloted to that item. For instance, the present score card calls for 30 varieties of corn in order for the exhibit to score 100 points on this Item. This might well be reduced and 20 varieties be substituted. Such action thruout the entire county collective score card would reduce the number of collective samples necessary and thereby save space enough in Agricultural Hall for the proper dis - playing of the new type of exhibit proposed. Such a score card revision involves considerable labor and study and should be most carefully considered from all standpoints. We make these suggestions knowing that they are far from perfect but as a basis for discussion and reorganization to make the Nebraska State Fair of even greater value educationally than it has been, even though it now leads among state fairs. Respectfully submitted, P. H. STEWART, D. L. GROSS. </seg>
            <seg id="p048">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE A good many of you saw the Exhibit that was displayed at the Ak-Sar-Ben. This is on the general order of the type of exhibit you saw there. What I have been talking about is something along the line of what we had at that Omaha show. I haven't taken up the score card yet. By PRESIDENT LAMB: We would like to have some discussion on this before we proceed to the adoption of this section of the report. By CHAIRMAN MILLER: We would like to have Mr. Grau's ideas on that. By CHARLES GRAU, Bennington: I don't quite get the- run of it. Of course, I notice the outlines of the exhibit at Omaha and the radical changes from what our system has been. Somehow or other I have not been . so very strongly impressed with what I saw at Omaha, especially with some of the booths. It seemed to me that at Omaha some of those booths were given over to too much paste - board and ink. I tell you when you want to put up an agricultural display you have got to display genuine goods. I think one of the greatest- com - pliments to Nebraska was given by the Canadian exhibit of agricul - ture we had at agricultural hall this year, last year and two years ago. I wondered how in the world they got such a wonderful agri - cultural exhibit. They said they had travelled all over the United Slates with their exhibit and had yet to see the first fair that had an exhibit equalling the show of products Nebraska makes. Your people of Nebraska are to be complimented for the wonderful show - ing you make of the products of your soil. There is no doubt in my mind but what we can make some material reductions in the score card — reductions in those classes that have been mentioned, like white corn. We can make some of these reductions, and some. eliminations, in order to get the space. There are some things in this collective exhibit matter, I- do not quite understand, Mr. Stewart. Would you eliminate County Collective Exhibits altogether, and have none of those, or would you have both? By MR. STEWART: Not at all. This is all in addition to the show we now have. I agree with you that we would not want to eliminate the County Collective — or individual classes there. The idea was to perhaps reduce the number sufficiently so as to have room to carry say ten or a dozen of the other exhibits that are pro - posed. I think we certainly don't want to eliminate the county col - lectives. By MR. GRAU: Have you worked out a plan for revising the Hcore card? I want to get In touch with you before any such action is taken. </seg>
            <seg id="p049">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE By MR. STEWART: I might now present some points we had in mind on this County Commodity or Resource Exhibit Score Card, then we can take that phase up in more detail as you suggest.

            <seg id="p052">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE By MR. GRAU: As I recall we took up matters relating to Class F last fall at a round table discussion and we talked about new classes and other changes In Class F, and it was talked over then with some of the exhibitors. Mr. Von Seggren acted as secretary of the meeting or clerk for the meeting and preserved some written minutes. We thought then that the matters then considered would be as far as the exhibitors there last fall would care to have us go. We didn't anticipate then any such sweeping recommendations as have now been proposed. By PRESIDENT LAMB: In regard to those recommendations, Mr. Von Seggren filed them and we have them here and they will be considered before this matter is settled. By MR. GRAU: We have no definite recommendations other than what was eventually adopted. PRESIDENT LAMB: Are there any other remarks along the line we have been considering? By SIR. A. H. MILLER: Since this is a new' idea and most of us do not seem to be prepared to discuss it, I would move that we continue this committee. This study should be continued so we may know if there is merit in this proposal and we might decide on it in the future. I feel we should have Mr. Grau meet with us — I was .awfully sorry he could not meet with us yesterday. Motion seconded.

STEWART: I think the man putting the motion should explain what that means. By MR. A. H. MILLER: I had in mind it is within the power of the Board to continue this committee and we can perhaps work out something more tangible for bringing in a new premium list. The Revision Committee, thus continued,, can bring in a further point. We don't want to bring in any new changes unless they have the approval of those interested. Nobody is more Interested than Mr. Grau — that is the reason we didn't take more definite action before. PRESIDENT LAMB: Motion for adjournment until 9 o'clock in the morning is in order.

            <seg id="p053">REI-ORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE THE ANNUAL BANQUET of the NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AORICUI/TURE and the NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OP COUNTY FAIR MANAGERS Hotel Cornhusker, January 21, 1930 HON. CLARK OBERLIES, Toastmaster, with more than usual wit and humor, entertained the gathering, introduced the speakers: MISS MARY ELLEN BROWN, speaking for the women and their viewpoint upon Pair work, said: "When Mr. Jackson asked me if I would appear on this program I told him I was the last person who should appear on a program of this kind; speaking was not my forte at all. Mr. Jackson had his way and this time the woman did not have the last word. I began to ask myself, What do I know about fairs? What did 1 first know about the State Pair? I began to scour my memory and it seemed to me the first thing I knew about the State Pair was many years ago when my father and mother went to Omaha to the State Fair. When mother came home, she was very happy about it. Then I thought, What do I know about the State Fair in Lincoln? Then I asked myself, Wasn't it because when I was in the Eighth grade I was privileged to spend two days at the state fair in Lincoln? If the children of today get the thrill I got then from their work at the Fair that I enjoyed then, it makes the whole thing well worth while; then it occurred to me, that then we didn't have automobiles and couldn't travel around everywhere like they do now and do they appreciate it as much now? Maybe it is too commonplace to them now and not so thrilling as it was to children then. I just want to take this chance to tell the Fair Boards how much we do appreciate what they are doing to make the Nebraska State Fair one of the very best in an educational way. Even though so much has been done we must not overlook that there is much yet to be done. We are hoping this Fair can continue to take the lead of the whole country in its educational phases. The next thing I can remember is when I was in Home Econom - ics work, at the State Farm, people came out there as they do now and we furnished a guide to escort them around the grounds, and we had one or two hostesses ready to explain our own work in Home Economics and we extended that work to the State Fair. At first we had a little corner in one of the old buildings. We prospered there in that beginning and it wasn't long before things began moving and soon the 4-H Club work blossomed out. Many of you remember that, beginning the first year as a part of the University exhibit. I think that was about 1918. They gave us about sixty feet of space, over </seg>
            <seg id="p054">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OK AGRICULTURE ill oue corner in Agricultural Hall. We began with a couple phases of work, canning demonstrations. How different that first year was from what we have at the present time. I think three canners came that first day. From that little corner think of where that work has progressed now. We soon spread to our own exhibit and added some swine and cattle to our exhibit. Even that is rather different from what we have now. By l!)2i) or thereabouts they gave some separate space to this Club work. Then before a great while they put the Club work over in the old Agricultural building. Just think,, it grew until last year something like 2,000 boys and girls took part on the grounds. There were exhibits for one purpose or another expanded to 6,000 entries. That has come about in such a short space of time. Perhaps I am here because I have been on the grounds all of those years In one capacity or another helping in that work. I was engaged in that l-H Club work for six years. Then the opportunity came that placed me in the task of working with the rural women of Nebraska. I just want to leave this message with you — that something worth while has been started in the work with the rural women of our state. It is not very big, nor at a very spectacular stage at the pres - ent time, but the rural women of Nebraska, for the past two years, have been conscious of being recognized at the State Fair, because of the generosity and foresight of the State Fair Board. They have been enabled to put on exhibits. These have attracted the worth while women who are making their homes happy 'and contented havens of cheer and rest. It makes them feel that the farm is really the best place to live. If you have a happy homemaker on the farm that family will rarely ever move to town regarding it as the proper place to bring up their boys and girls, but .will be more likely to stay on the farm, so there is a wonderful goal ahead of those women who are now doing project work. I have watched the 4-H work make its humble start; it has grown way beyond anything we could have foreseen or expected. We couldn't have dreamed a few years ago it would reach the stage it has now reached, and I hope we likewise can't even dream of the progress the rural women's work will like - wise make. I am glad to tell you that the rural women will co - operate in every way they can with the State Fair. They will come with their boys and girls. Isn't that a fine thing to do? I thank you." Entertainment furnished at this point by two small boys in an athletic event and violin solos by Carl Steckelberg, followed the next speaker. The toaBtmaster then introduced MR. FRANK D. TOMSON, of Lincoln, who entertained with his rare wit and humor, and in closing, from the layman, outside citizens and patrons' viewpoint, made the following observations: </seg>
            <seg id="p055">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE "It is always of Interest to the people of Lincoln when you folks from all over the state assemble here. ■ If there is any one thing we are more proud of in Lincoln than any other one thing it is that we are trying to reflect the sentiment of the entire state. Many of your people come here annually to stay and become a part of our city. We are a sober people, as you are in the country. We try to be progressive, we try to do things so as to build the best type of citizen - chip. We move along rather serenely, and move along just as Ne - braska moves along. We are somewhat conservative. May I cite one instance. Just the other day we elected for his twenty-fifth suc - cessive year in that office, our Secretary of the Chamber of Commerce. In all of the United States there are only three or four men in that work with records equal to that, or cities in which the same man lias served an equal length of time that Walter Whitten has served Lincoln. You gentlemen living in all parts of the state know some - thing of the work he had done and the service he has rendered not only for- this community but for your communities through the co - operation you have been inclined to accord him. Another thing I might mention. When we needed a Chancellor for the University, a survey was made over the whole United States with one eye but we didn't take the other eye oft Nebraska and finally we selected for that office, right here at home, the present Chancellor who had been serving in. our midst for twenty-five or more years. A happier selection could not have been made.- It will re - dound to our credit for all time, and it shows we do not need to go outside of our own state to select our strong leaders." Violin solos by Carl Steckelberg, and then the Toastmaster in - troduced a surprise and unscheduled number, a representative of the Concession people who made some remarks reminiscently, as follows: MR. ALEX SLOAN, of Chicago: I was at the Rotary Club today with Mr. Jackson and some of the other people here, and they asked me how long ago I' started automobile race work. I said, 1903, and someone said that is a long long time ago. It is for that work. Here, in brief, is the story. Then the automobile didn't run much faster than twelve miles an hour. Did you know that the show world has been a great field for developing a great many slang words? The expression "gypp" came from that source, and came into use from lair grounds. Some gypsies would start to take money away from people without giving them anything in return, and from that practice came forth the word "gypp." Did you ever stop to think from whence came the word "bull?" That came into common usage about the time the automobile ran twelve miles an hour. Back in 1903 or 1904, Barney Old lie Id was then the first auto - mobile racing driver in this country. He had a car known as 999, which was really the first racing car developed in this country — by Henry Ford. In fact he developed the modern automobile from this </seg>
            <seg id="p056">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OK -AGRICULTURE S99. Oldfleld was the main racer, in Tact about the only car avail - able then was this one. We had- him booked for a race where we al - ready had booked wrestling with a bull, so we selected him. as an additional attraction for an automobile race. There was only the one racing car, so on the day the races came on he went out with old 999. In those days they had a lot of trouble with the automobiles — they didn't start like they do in these later days. Then there wasn't buch a thing as a loud speaker, so the manager, came out and an - nounced, "The next thing on the program will be the cranking of P99." That in itself ■ was quite an event- in those days. One big fellow would run out with the crank. Then they would announce, "Ladies and gentlemen, the next event on the program will be the pushing of 999," then everyone out there would push on the car. They had already had the wrestling with the bull, the main event on the program, when some fellow hollered out "Bring on the BULL." From that on down to the present that has been a common expres - sion — Bring on the Bull. So it was the first time the word BULL was used. I have kept on working with races and other amusement enter - prises and been going to state fairs and local fairs racing automobiles for more than fifteen years. In that time it has been my pleasure to have visited by hundreds, fairs and visited the associations of state fairs and county fairs and I 'can say honestly that the meetings you have held here year after year have been the most interesting. You are to be most highly congratulated on the most wonderful type of fair men I have met here. I want to express the appreciation of the traveling fellows for the courtesy and treatment we have received here at this meeting. . EMERSON R. PURCELL, of Broken Bow, called upon for a couple of minutes greetings, especially from the new' Game, Fish and Park Commission, in which he concluded: "The county fairs of Nebraska can do a great work along the line of improving their fair grounds. At a recent meeting of the Board of the State Game and Park Commissioners in considering a forestration policy it was emphasized that the cooperation of the county fairs in planting trees on their fair grounds would render :&gt; distinct help. I just wanted to bring this thought to the county fair men of the state of Nebraska and ask that you keep this in mind and give the matter of beautincation of your fair grounds by planting of trees due consideration. I am Bure you will be doing a work that will bring you and your community a very great benefit. T want to plant this thought in your minds and I hope it will take root with you." The Toastmaster then introduced HON. A. C. SHALLENBERG - ER, who addressed the assemblage, and brought out among other things, the following thoughts: </seg>
            <seg id="p057">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE By EX-GOVERNOR SHALLENBERGER: I have been a showman at fairs tor a long time. But before I was ever known as a cattle breeder I was known over the world as a dog breeder. I had one big St. Bernard who won in Chicago and then I took him to New York and won with him, before you people out here ever heard of me. I beat this man Jake Ruppert, who is boss and paymaster of Babe Ruth. I don't know whether Babe is going to beat him on salary dispute or not. I beat him. My dog beat at London then. I went right out from Alma, in the Republican Valley with my dog and beat the dogs of those New York millionaires. Then I went into politics, but I have never been quite so successful showing myself as I was with the dog. . I finally broke into the Governorship and I signed the eight o'clock closing law and they got rid of me because they only had thirteen hours a day in which to drink and now they would be glad if they had one hour a day in which to drink. But my young daughter consoled me when she said, "But Papa we will be Ex-Governor." Yes, that is one title they can't take away from us. While I was Governor I was invited to meet with the business men of St. Louis to discuss the great subject in which our present splendid Governor is so Interested, the improvement of our water - ways. Since those St. Louis and Kansas City business men were working on that in 1909, a great deal, of progress has been made on Mississippi River development and some little advance on Missouri River. Now our work in politics leaves a fleeting record. I enjoy my work breeding cattle and showing them at our fairs. That is the thing By which I expect to leave my impress on the state of Ne - braska. When you breed cattle — pure bred cattle — you have a rec - ord of those cattle — generally as far back as Adam and his herd. A record is made of what you do — their pedigree is preserved and one hundred years after when you are gone, and yes, forgotten, and it is well forgotten that you ever were Governor or Congressman or that Governor Weaver ever gave me a job hunting up the destination of lost money, a record can be consulted as to what you did along the cattle breeding and showing line. You have heard of my bull that took prize after prize at the state fairs last fall; this bull right out in Denver yesterday won a grand championship for Nebraska as being the best Shorthorn bull in America; he was bred right here in Nebraska. Twelve times he has been adjudged grand champion at the great fairs and expositions of this country. Our fairs promote the best interest of the people of Nebraska. There our live stock and all of the other things we produce in our slate are displayed and can become well understood. We produce a great deal in this state and are apt not to realize our opportunities unless we have these opportunities of looking into our show windows and coming to realize that we can make Nebraska the best agricul - tural state in the Union. We will never get far unless we get into </seg>
            <seg id="p058">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE competition with the other states and hold our own. It is at these fairs we educate the farmers, a sort of a graduate school for farmers, to show and understand the products of their farms. The people more and more are attending the fairs and expositions to see the products of other farms and thus find out where they could attain better results in their own work. As I said before the greatest ex - pert on agriculture is the farmer, right on his own farm, and then he brings the results of his experiments to the fair where he shows it to others. The Toastmaster then introduced as the next speaker to extend greetings from the Educational World, CHANCELLOR E. A. BUR - NETT, of State University, Lincoln, who said, among other things: "I just want to repeat what has been so often said, the State Fair is one of the great educational institution!? of this state, and it is great because every man and woman, yes child, who comes to the State Fair in competition brings the results of their handiwork and puts those up against the experts in their line and submits it' to the critical mercy of the Judges. Even if he doesn't succeed in winning a championship prize, he gets a valuable education as to what is neces - sary to raise his work to a winning standard. Through all of the classes of the state fair the products of agriculture are being sub - mitted to this educating process; the competitions of these shows are working as a training school with their valuable impressions. The success of the individual is important; you come to the state fair to get the critical judgment upon your exhibits. . We know it takes the best one had to compete In this struggle. In our University work we have to bring the same critical judg - ment to bear upon the achievements of our men and women striving for an education so they can sooner determine the degrees of their success and determine whether or not they desire to follow this or that line of work; they must determine whether the track they are traveling in is the right one for them and whether the line- of study they are following in the university is going to help them achieve what they desire when they get out of school. But in the end, we are proud of the men and women who go out from our school. They are the people who are accomplishing great things in the world. Of course, they are not the only people who are doing so, but they are among the leaders in this state and other states where they go. The records of the University will bear the closest scrutiny. . The people of Nebraska In their interest In that school have built a great institution, of which they can be proud. We are proud to' move right along with your State Fair. It is like - wise one of the great educational institutions of the state and we want to extend and continue our close co-operation between these two institutions, that mark the progress of our State," </seg>
            <seg id="p059">UEPORT OE NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The Toastmaster then introduced the final speaker of the even- Ing, who extended the greetings of the people of the State of Ne - braska: GOVERNOR ARTHUR J. WEAVER, (who in part spoke as fol - lows): Mr. Toastmaster, Mr. Shallenberger, distinguished guests who have come here from all over the state and all of you — it is a real pleasure for me to be here tonight. I shall not speak to you at any preat length because of the lateness of the hour. We have enjoyed a wonderful entertainment. We have had such wonderful addresses, and Alex Sloan has shown us the appreciation of the showmen, and they are no pikers. We have at this table tonight two of the great - est showmen who ever lived, George Jackson and Clark Oberlies. If you knew them as I do you would know that George swears a little once in a while and Clark prays a little, but neither of them really means anything by It. Something has been said about my appointment of Governor Phallenberger as an expert on deficits. I take pride in my appoint - ments as Governor in this state, and no matter what I do as Gov - ernor in any of the great departments of Nebraska, be it the banking department, road department, trade and commerce department, de - partment of labor and welfare, or tax commissioner, this depart - ment over which Governor Shallenberger presides will speak well for this administration. We are proud of Governor Shallenberger, and we have a right to be proud of him, not only because he was a great Governor, a great Congressman, but because through all of these years he has been interested in the great resources of Nebraska. He has been an upbuilder of the state In its Important live-stock in - dustry. When we have such leaders, we need not worry about the future of the state. We have a right to be proud of our congressmen at Washington who have represented this state. Primarily these men who have made the greatest success in our legislative halls at the national capital have been men who have been closely associated with the great industries of agriculture ia our state. We are producing five hundred millions of dollars of agricultural products annually; when you count in the manufacturing you boost the production of our state another five hundred millions of dollars. We have a wonderful history in our state covering just a few decades of a inost romantic record. We have shown that not only corn, hut cattle and hogs are kings. In the western part of the state sugar beets are king. In the central part of the state as well as in the eastern part, corn, cattle and hogs are all king. Our state is just in its infancy. We have more miles of river in this state than any state in the Union. We have a simply amazing potential possibility within the confines of Nebraska for building an empire, not only an empire of wealth but of human resources and prestige. We have built bounti - fully through these years this material wealth, but what does it </seg>
            <seg id="p060">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE amount to if we do not build within our state a citizenship worthy of that material wealth. Piling up these material resources is just accumulating dross unless with it we acquire character and beautify sympathy for others, unless we build a real citizenship, based upon our education and in which future Nebraska may take a pride. We are one of the first states in the nation on the amount of money we spend on our schools. From the little schoolhouse out in the country upward to our university we have built an educational system, of which we can be proud in every unit. Therefore, the intelligence of our people rivals Iowa our great neighbor, for first place for the record of being the state with the least percentage of illiteracy in the Union. We have made wonderful progress in this state In the past few years along the line of making our fairs educational. We can point to the 4H Club work—^the Boys and Girls Club work. If there was no other activity on those fair grounds it would make these fairs worth while for all they cost. Think of what it means that last year there were 12,000 boys and girls taking a serious view of life and a serious view as to the meaning of Nebraska, as to its purposes and its people, and as to the meaning of agriculture; its live stock, its horticulture and its varied other activities. That is what this work means. When we read in the morning papers of the prizes awarded in the judging contests, and estimate the value of this work year after year, then we know that we are making a success of these fairs. Our state fair represents an investment of a million and a half of dollars and it has cost our people of this great state nothing. The records of this fair show that in premiums in the last thirty years, paid to the exhibitors and people of this state, this state has ap - propriated $100,000 less than what it has paid back to the producers of Nebraska in the form of premiums for their exhibits in live-stock and other products. Then the state owns these buildings and full plant worth over a million and a half dollars. How did that come about? It came about because of the splendid co-operation of these county fairs of Nebraska without which you could not have built this great premier institution, the Nebraska State Fair. I want to give fully deserved credit to the county fairs tonight as the foundation stone of all of it. If it cost the people of the State of Nebraska several hundred thousand dollars a year for the maintenance of that in - stitution it would receive full value from its existence. It has come about because the people co-operated and took an interest in it. Something was said about democrats and republicans tonight. The' business of our state, both In its legislative matters and Its executive functions are above mere politics. I am glad to say that I had the honor to be a member of this State Fair Board for eight years. This year I relinquished a real honor, when I did not 'become President of this State Fair Board for this current year. Where could you find a greater scroll of names in a hall of fame than in this state when you survey the roster of men who have been President of this Fair </seg>
            <seg id="p061">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE Hoard; men who have worked up year by year? There have been J. Sterling Morton, the first Secretary of Agriculture and author of ArborDay; men who have afforded a real inspiration to the people of our state. Robert Furnas, an early great Governor of our state, not only an expert on agriculture but a pioneer in horticulture as well, and first Editor of the Nebraska Farmer, a paper which through the years has helped build up our State. I could go on down this long illustrious line. One of the speakers tonight, Emerson Purcell, is one of my long - time friends, a man whom 1 am proud to have placed on this new Fish, Game and Parks. Commission. When we consolidated the Fish' &amp; Game Bureau with the Park Commission instead of erecting a new department we combined two existing bureaus and commissions. It is a bl-partisan board, which functions like the State Board of Agriculture functions, in the interests of Nebraska. Its dream is before it becomes too late — before these things are all destroyed that Ne - braska should save what it can for its people of all time to come. It wants to preserve these things not only for this generation but for all posterity. Now why does that apply to fair-work? It is the duty of the fairs to aid in that work wherever they can. I am glad to see this move by the administration at Washington to establish this Farm Board. ] t may not be all we need, but it is a step in the right direction. It is the first time I have been sitting with this Board of Agriculture that something has been attempted along the line of helping agri - culture help itself; the first time we have had a congressional act that seems to give us an orderly marketing and distribution system. It endeavors to remove our marketing from the gambling system heretofore practiced and give a profit to the farmer. We should be tolerant and patient with it and try and see if it succeeds; to hastily judge it is disheartening; let's give it a fair trial. I want to say again I deemed it a great honor to have been a member of this Board, I remember when I was chosen after the loss of that wonderful leader of its work. Doctor P. L. Hall, whom I thus had the honor to succeed. Word was brought to me that I had been chosen, all of which had happened without my knowledge. I immed - iately came to Lincoln so I could show my interest in the work and express my appreciation of the honor that had been conferred upon me. When the Board of Managers soon asked me if I would be Superintendent of Machinery, I said, there were others better qual - ified for that task, but I stood ready to do whatever they asked and assigned; that is the spirit of this organization; each one does what he is asked. It is such men as those here tonight who have made this State Fair what It has grown to be. This fair wouldn't succeed with - out all of them. I was both pleased and thrilled tonight when Clark Oberlies called for Morris Reichenbach to stand up. I will tell you who he is. He is the man who is Superintendent of those grounds. </seg>
            <seg id="p062">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE He is the man who works all day and about all night just before the Fair opens up to see that all is in readiness and then works all year to see it is kept in good shape and ready for the next Fair. Then Mrs. Gadd and Mrs. Graham, those are the women who guide George Jackson at the office and see that everything runs right up there. We want to be proud not only of Governor Shallenberger, but all of these others I have mentioned. We will follow their leadership and we shall do much in the years to come. These men who make this fair serve without asking pay or credit, but strive for the up - building of Nebraska because they love this work. We really are proud or them and in the years to come this work will stand as a monument for their services as our State Fair reaches even higher distinction. Program closed and banquet dispersed.

(Secretary calls the roll and shows a quorum present.) PRESIDENT LAMB: We will next have the Report of Committee on Resolutions. By CHAIRMAN E. J. MITCHELL, Deshler: Your Committee on Resolutions present the following resolutions for your consideration: 1. "Whereas: It has become an all too prevalent practice on the part of certain exhibitors of livestock at oar state fairs and livestock expositions to resort to the practice and use of artificial means of changing the conformation of animals competing for prizes by the use of drugs and operations intended to deceive the judges and the public as to the true conformation of the animals on exhibition: Therefore; Be it resolved that we condemn such practices as dishonest and deceptive and call upon managers of livestock exposi - tions and fairs, breed associations and judges officiating at such shows to stamp out such dishonest methods by the adoption of stringent rules that will not only disqualify animals so operated upon but also bar exhibitors guilty of such practices from participating in such shows in the future. Therefore, we would recommend that all the . managers of all livestock expositions and fairs employ such agencies as are necessary to detect and expose to the proper authorities and management such dishonest practices and methods."

Senator Vance, will you go to the room in the hotel where that com - mittee has been in conference and see if they are ready to bring in their conclusions? While we are waiting for them, we might inquire as to whether there is anything any of you want to bring up; any question to bring up, any grievance against the management or con - duct of our Fair, or the Board in its conduct of business, we will be glad to hear from them at this time. By CHARLES GRAFF, Bancroft: While we seem to be at leisure, I thought perhaps it might be all right to have the Revision Com - mittee, or any of its members who are here, explain a little bit as to the departure that has been proposed from the old rule in Class "B." I noticed yesterday you were beginning to make a change that may lead to wide-spread consequences; When people begin to read these changes in the next premium list they will make a discovery I am afraid that will prove the Revision Committee have entered into a new. field, one that will create a desire upon the part of those who don't come in that class of breeders to be put upon a like basis or equality with the other breeds. Those of you fellows who have known me or known of me on this Board for many years perhaps can recall I have always in - sisted on our doing just what we advertised to the world we were </seg>
            <seg id="p065">REPORT OK NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OK AGRICULTURE doing. As I understand it the committee lias amended those rules; they have sorted out four classes -or breeds of cattle or decreased their standing, and they have brought forth a "Nebraska Class" an addition to the open class. Now, I don't know whether that is a good idea unless the Board 13 able to follow it out and make the idea broader than it is. In connection with that thought I would say they have also made a sweep- Ing change, which is a change I heartily endorse— that is that these dairy breeders, these four breeds I have mentioned, Mr. Secretary, are going to be required after this year to come into the show and stand on their record of performance. I think that is a fine step in the right direction. I did not care yesterday to take the matter up, and perhaps the thing will work out right, but I just want \o leave this thought with you; if you will notice— I have been afraid for some years that this thing was going to come because the Nebraska exhibit - ors going into Iowa and Illinois and other different states have com - plained that they have met the situation there, but the Nebraska ex - hibitors are not afraid of competition trom anywhere they run into it and run into conditions where they have an open class with little money. But they have found there the state classes had a great deal of money and while our people could get all the premiums in the open classes they found the other fellow was getting the long money. This has been argued to the Board of Managers before. That condi - tion seemed as if it was discriminatory against the Nebraska breeders. 1 have always heard that Nebraska is not afraid of competition and not afraid to show against the breeders of these other states. How - ever, I am still afraid the thing we are doing may be an entering wedge, and of course as I was on that Board of Managers for many years I know the conditions they are facing. They would like to do many big things, fellows, if they could just see their way clear to meet the financial demands. I know we have always tried to play fair with the home man. I just want to leave this with you. I know it is quite a radical departure from our old rule and I hope it be successful and I believe in another year we will see an improvement. I have imagined a lot of times, fellows, we have a great many breeders of cattle, in all breeds, that they have become so numerous, who have stuff that is pleasing to the eye of the average spectator. They really do slip them in under the dairy breeds. You know we have one breed of cattle and a very prominent breed in this country, in fact one of the two most prominent in the United States, all of you recognize them and they are recognized officially by the same Breed Association. That breed association is divided into three distinct breeds when they come into our show. Now I have always felt that was going pretty strong. I happen to be one of those who took up thirty years ago this particular breed of cattle. Although I am out of the game now, I think a great deal of them today. They are called a dual purpose breed. If we should decide that these breeders who haven't the quality of the dual purpose breed have got to qualify elsewhere, and </seg>
            <seg id="p066">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE . separate them we can hope for a dairy breed, because they don't look good as beet cattle. On the books* they would be dairy cattle. I know that those who think the Board of Managers is always up against it, out I am here to say when our breed is going to be separated in that way, it will be over my protest. I don't believe it in. Now, gentlemen, I want to thank you if you are interested in what I have to say, I hope I haven't said a word to make you feel bad; I say it with a feeling that these are some things the State Hoard of Managers ought to know. . ! By PERRY REED, Hamilton Co.: I would like to ask Mr. Graff if he understands the purpose of this change to be that this year is the first time we made this Nebraska class,' or that it was added. In fact, it was added two years ago I think for dairy breeds and .we have been working under that classification since then. By PRESIDENT LAMB: That classification was put on at the dairymen's request; they could not compete against foreign herds. We are not big enough yet. It was said that when we get big enough we will take it off. Regarding the performance requirement of the dairy herd, that does not take effect until 1931. I see Mr. McLaughlin here and he might have something to say. By MR. H. J. MCLAUGHLIN, Secretary Department of Agricul - ture: Mr. Chairman, I don't know what I can say but I might say something I should not say if I did talk. A good many of these counties »re interested in the kind of work we are doing. As you men all know, Koing back a great many years, I have been interested in cleaning up our cattle in this state. We have had a very modest appropriation ever since 1919 with which to clean up tuberculosis in our cattle. Some of the eastern states, such as New York and Illinois, have spent millions of dollars to do this work for the simple reason they neglected the work in former years. We have 'done what we could in this, state in our small way and since 1919 have accomplished a great deal. In fact, now out of our 03 counties we have 38 accredited counties; counties which are ad - judged to be free of tuberculosis. We have never had an appropriation greater than $285,000 per biennium. In this present year we have an appropriation of $300,000. Five years ago when I came into this office we did not have an accredited county in the state, and now as I said before we have thirty-eight. We have about forty-seven counties under supervision. Another county soon will be and that will make us forty-eight counties under supervision. This is a bigger, thing than a great many people realize. The time will come and it is not far distant, when every man will be re - quired to clean up his cattle without any aid from the state or federal government. The Federal Government is co-operating with us at the present time and paying the same indemnity we do and are furnish - ing part of the help to do the work in this state. A few of the eastern states have become fully accredited and some more will be in the </seg>
            <seg id="p067">ftEPOKT OV NEBRASKA STATE HOARD OK AGRICULTURE near future. When Iowa. Illinois, Indiana and Ohio all become ac - credited, and that will be in a few years, there will be an embargo put on territory— in unclean territory, then sandhill cattle from our state will not be able to find a market and those breeders will not find a market unless these come under the strictest regulations. I would like to have you think" this matter over when you go home and move toward cleaning up your areas properly; if you want m h T tle UndeF ° lean condlt »°»a; and if you can't raise clean cattle don t raise any cattle at all. This is a health problem and all ot the various great cities now require clean milk. I was in Chicago rn/T FS ag ° When the hea "h officers were beginning to come forth with an order that all milk sold in Chicago had to be clean milk from well cared for cattle. The law of Illinois, at that time, did not require the tuberculin test. Now Illinois has cleaned up the state although it has spent millions or dollars to accomplish this. This same terrible disease affects hogs and it affects chickens. We are gradually coming to clean-up campaigns.on all of these phases. \Ve want to get our laws improved on all of these phases. Some of these conditions have been cleaned up. I have been a member of the legislature so I enjoyed an understanding of this that perhaps some of the legislators did not have. I could go on and say a great dell about this work. I don't know whether Mr. Lamb had that in mind when he called upon me to talk about these things, as he knows I do whenever I get a chance. • You fair men represent the county fairs and you represent agri - culture in your parts of the state. You need this work. We all need this. I might just cite an instance in one of our counties to illustrate the importance of this work. Three years ago one man who had a very fine appearing bunch of cattle when the tests came supposedly submitted his herd. The count seemed accurate, but this came up when after three years a retest came about. We retest every third year under agreement with the Federal Government. They came to this herd. This man had seven cows he used for his home dairy and among them we found several re-actors— in the seven cows We tried to trace these cattle and we could not trace them through the last list. The question arose, where did he get them? We found that he got them out of his pasture and yard. Right out of his own herd The final discovery was that he had hid those. The result was that 47 out of 107 cattle had lesions, one ot the worst bunches you could find anywhere. That man had hid away that bunch himself and re - produced cattle with that disease right on his own farm and he had thought he was beating the state out of something. That just illus - trates the value of this work and the danger of evading it. In Chi - cago, when Dr. Bundeson gave his order for only clean milk many dairy herds were 100%. re-actors. Milk men said it would be Im - possible to get a supply of milk if that rule was enforced, but it did not turn out that way and now they use only clean milk. Those things seem to take care of themselves. </seg>

We would then like, to have this Agricultural Department thoroughly, discussed from every angle possible. By CHAIRMAN A. H. MILLER, Blair: Mr. Chairman, we went over the Premium List as to Class F and we made eliminations with the specific idea of. determining how much money we could save in order that we might put on this new idea which was exemplified at the Omaha Ak-Sar-Ben show. We had a number of exhibitors. Super - intendent Grau and Asst. Supt. Von Seggren and some others meet with us and study this problem, and help determine whether we could save enough to put on the new idea. Mr. Von Seggren, will you go through the list and show just what we did; how much we figured we could save; so we may all know how much money our estimate would show might be so saved. By MR. W. E.

Next Lot 1640 (Collection of Grains) was eliminated. . ■ Now into Lot 2 — Threshed Grass Seeds, Lots 1644 (White Clover) and 1645 (Alsike) were eliminated, and Lot 1661 (Collection of Grass Seeds) was also eliminated. In Lot 3, Sheaf Display, Item 1683, (Collection of sheaves by a county) was taken out. From Lot 4, Stalk Display, Items 1717 and 1718 (Kaffir, Jeru - salem and Shallu) were dropped. A paragraph under Lot 4 will be changed to provide this judging will now be judged as forage and fodder. Moving over to Item 1779 (the Collection potatoes, to contain Vi bushel, any variety) is taken oft so as to reduce the expense in other changes in Lot 7 — Vegetables. We proposed to make the other classes in Lot 7, on potatoes, such as Early Ohio, Irish Cobbler and Triumph, more important by raising the money to 1st. 2nd. 3rd. 4th. 5th. $4.00 $3.00 $2.00 $1.50 $1.00 on Lots 1769 (Early Ohio) 1770 (Irish Cobbler) and 1774 (Triumph). Item 1796 — (Collection of Beans and 'Peas — Hulled — % bu. each) and in fact all collections of seeds are cut out. </seg>
            <seg id="p069">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF. AGRICULTURE There has been added to Lot 4, some Items from Lot 10 — Corn — a division applying heretofore to Central District down in Stalk Dis - play, Items 1891 (Yellow Dent) 1892 (White Dent) and 1893 (Other Dents). The same is true of additions from Lot 11, of Numbers 1916, 1917 and 1918. Now in Lot 6 — Vine Products, Table Queen Squash and Turban Squash have been added to that lot. These changes effect all of the Collections except Native Grasses. I believe those are all the changes we estimated upon or pro - posed except the County Collections. Now we come to the Score Card (page 121). Taking the Classes of Exhibits by the same numbers shown there and the limited number of varieties, these changes are: 1. Corn (Dent) i No. of varieties reduced from 30 to 20 2. Corn (Other than Dent) No. of varieties reduced from 25 to 20 3. Wheat No. of varieties reduced from 20 to 15 4. Oats No. of varieties reduced from 20 to 15 5. Barley, Rye, Flax, Etc Open to 20 6. Other Varieties of Grains S Remains at 30 7. Seed and Forage Crops ..Reduced from 50 to 30 8.

Squashes, Melons, Pumpkins Remain at 100 14. Root Crops From open to 50 15. Stalk Display : '. Remains 50 16. Miscellaneous ; Remains at 100 That would make a reduction there when totaled up and that reduction is mainly in the County Collectives. It will cost the Fair Board more money for some of the counties, but the smaller counties that are not able to have the required or limited number or full number of varieties heretofore, with the re - duced number as now required can qualify, and thus add to the cost in that division. For instance, take the reduction in corn from 30 to 20 varieties — this means it makes it easier for those smaller counties to come up somewhere near the requirement. The total amount of reductions amount to $355.00, with $36.00 as the amount added; or right around $300.00 saving. By CHAIRMAN MILLER: But our next reaction is that this $300.00 estimated saving may be absorbed in the County Collectives. The point is, Mr. President, there will be money absorbed for new collections. Our problem then is to get money enough to arrange for the changes. What can we do to effect an inauguration of the new </seg>
            <seg id="p070">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE system? This is something Mr. Jackson has had his heart set on, in common with others who agree with hinj. Mr. Grau, what would your re-action be? By MR. GRAU: You say we have saved by cutting off on some unimportant classes. We might save a little, even $300.00. But just at a rough guess all of that will be otherwise absorbed in the in - creases in many of the smaller counties. Dent corn has heretofore been limited to thirty varieties in making up a collective exhibit. That would make 3.8 points for every variety carried in the col - lection; now In cutting it to 20 that makes 5 points for every variety in the collection. Heretofore some of the western counties that carried ten varieties got $33.00. Now they would have ten varieties and would get $50.00. Working all the way down the line on the score card you will find the smaller western counties that haven't hereto - fore received enough money to justify theni in bringing a collective exhibit will win more money. The bigger counties, like Douglas, Wash - ington and Lancaster may get less money, they have been getting their 100 points anyway, and dividing the money among the big counties where they scored 100 points. By cutting off the collections where the rule conies to the larger counties they are going to get even less money. If we had time to have the score card passed on and established right here, we might work out a new key on the present records and scores perhaps we could have figured out how to absorb the old counties that have won more money, and estipiate what we would win or lose by the proposed change. But just -on a rough guess we can only estimate what would happen to absorb the $300.00 saving we figure would accrue from the present proposal. The State Fair Board can continue to work out a premium list on the proposed basis and perhaps later we can carry that out. But I Relieve from my observa - tion at the Ak-Sar-Ben show it is going to cost something to build up the equipment for this plan. You must tear out some shelving und construct new booths all of which is a matter for the State Board to work out. It isn't possible for this committee to do all of that at this time. But I do believe some rough estimate of that should be formed at this time, and the plan worked out for this new set-up so it will be made attractive to these festern counties and they will put some additional exhibits and then we can plan someway to get more money. By MR. P.- H. STEWART: Some of what Mr. Grau says is prob - ably correct, we may have to revise some of those to conform to that situation. As he Baid, we have. put emphasis on the number of varieties in Class F to make the exhibitions more educational but we haven't saved money particularly in other phases. I am convinced that finally the State Fair will want to put in this other type of exhibit. But It is going to take some money, just as Mr. Grau said. That is up to the Board. Possibly it better be passed up this year and taken up another time in the future. ■ </seg>

By SECY GEO. JACKSON: Mr. Chairman, this idea is not a new one nor a new thing. I have visited the Exposition at Toronto, the State Fairs at Iowa and Dallas, Texas, and individual exhibits are put on there and keep up with the progress of the state. I can't help but be very favorable to this individual" exhibit. We do not want to throw out the old exhibit. We are proud of our Agricultural Hall and of our agricultural exhibits. People come here from other states and they wonder how we can put on such an agricultural exhibit and put in the things we do and how we show so much advancement. You may remember that a few years ago we sent out a letter from our office requesting that the fair men feature some new ideas of building in their exhibits and around that idea quite a number </seg>
            <seg id="p072">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE did that. I remember Lexington did tor instance, they put in a hay exhibit with a hay house. Now we fellows here have studied the sit - uation a little. We knew they grew lots and lots of alfalfa hay around there; after that Fair ninety per cent of the people who visited that fair knew it — and now they know and realize it is a great alfalfa country. This exhibit at the Ak-Sar-Ben they had sold hundreds and thousands of bushels of alfalfa for Dawson County this year. With potatoes it has been much the same. We have got to get out of the rut. Our exhibits look fine around Agricultural Hall, but do most of them have any particular drawing power or appeal to people. They must make an impression on people. What Is going to be done; what are the particular feasible ideas about agriculture in Nebraska? Down in the southeast corner of our state we have some of the finest fruit, especially apples,. In the nation. Up in Valley County, we have as all of you know, a section that raises the most popcorn of any locality, except perhaps one, but the World doesn't know that. My report on the attendance shows we have visitors here from nil over the World. We can display alfalfa, we can show our pro - duction out in the sugar beet region, so what we have to do is to advertise our specialized production — we mUst stop for each exhibit and specialize on some one. thing. Whether you make an exhibit of it or whether you feature that one thing and build around it, we must emphasize the particular thing. We should . just keep on with that line, and keep progressing until in time we can have the biggest fair in the United States, making these individual exhibits. I don't want you to understand I want you to throw out the other exhibits. But we do want you to feature specialized exhibits more and more. I have followed up and found other fairs are doing this and they are going to do it more and more. Just imagine what we could do with our Irrigated country. Some one might demonstrate, by putting on an irrigation plant — exhibit showing such a plant In operation. Show what can be raised by Irrigation; what a field for featuring exhibits we have in our cattle business in this state. Take our sugar beet country. Take a big beet, have trucks coming out of the beet, hauling sugar. Those things are all good Ideas and nothing is charged for. taking and using them. I want Nebraska to keep up with the times, or even better, keep two jumps ahead of the times. We can visualize. I would like for this individual exhibit to be put in some way. We do not want to eliminate other good collective exhibits, but T know from the Ak-Sar-Ben exhibits — while they didn't have such an attendance there, of course, as we have, still I know those exhibits were attention-getters. They drew attention.: There wasn't an exhibit up there but what people remembered it and they know very well what the people living there are doing in that particular part of the state. </seg>
            <seg id="p073">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE That is the thing we have got to do; we are building up our state — but perhaps we are not functioning as we might be. The thing we want to do with all exhibits is to make them attractive, but we want them not only to look nice, but to present the outstanding things the region has to present. I want to see some action taken that leaves the way clear for the Board to put on some of this individual type of exhibit. By E. It. PUURCELL, Custer Co.: I would like to ask Mr. Jack - son; what is your- opinion of the approximate increased expense to Class "F" if this is done to a limited extent? By SECY.

Then leave the matter of a new exhibit up to the Board of Managers to work out afterwards. By CHAIRMAN MILLER: I renew my original motion. I have an - other motion for other purposes to later put it before the Board of Managers; but first I renew the original motion that the Committee report on Class "F" be adopted. Motion re-seconded. By PRESIDENT LAMB: You have heard the motion, those In favor will signify by Aye; contrary. No. Motion carried, report adopted. By MR. E. R. PURCELL, Custer Co.: As I said, when I visited Ak-Sar-Ben last fall I went through their Agricultural exhibits. It got under my hide in a different way from anything I had ever seen and I had to go through it two or three different times. It seems to me there is an opportunity of advertising and bringing returns to the various counties of the state in a better way and a bigger way than we are now doing. I feel the same way as some of the other speakers here, that I wouldn't want to cripple In any way the other classes of exhibits we now have In agriculture, but I do believe we could not do a bigger thing than to add this Individual exhibit. </seg>
            <seg id="p074">RETORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE I got up here with an intention of making a motion. I do not know just how to make it, but I want to express this thought In connection with it; that I think this should be left to the Board of Managers to put in such an amount and arrange collective exhibits as in their judgment they find advisable, keeping in mind that it is the desire of this body that such collective exhibits be added- so I would move you Mr. President that the matter of Collections of Individual Exhibits be arranged by the Board of Managers as in their best judgment they deem fit, from time to time, this new feature •»e added all to be left to the judgment of the Board of Managers to lie arranged. Motion seconded.' By PRESIDENT LAMB: You have heard the motion. Are there uny remarks? I want to say something with reference to Class "B." There has been a matter before the Board for the last three or four years upon which the Board has been divided. I think it is really proper it should be brought up here before this whole body. We have been accused of making some sweeping changes. Perhaps so, because it is the purpose of the county fairs and state fair to keep abreast of the times and promote things that are of intense interest to all of our patrons. We went so far as to strike out the Clydesdales, the Shires, etc.. in our department. We have been acquainted not so long with the Clydesdales and Shires as being prominent breeds in Nebraska but it has gotten so in the past few years there have been no promin - ent breeders in Nebraska come to the State Fair with those breeds We have an exhibitor from Iowa come in and he claims the money we have been offering. The suggestion I am about to offer is with reference to Milking Shorthorns. We. have had money on Galloways, I think we had $600.00 on dairy class. We have maintained that to promote and foster the breeding of that type more productively. To my mind it has been proven in exhibits made by Shorthorn men that if they have got a cow— a red cow— that looks like a milker, and that is a producer so far as milk is concerned they will take that class, and put her in as a milking shorthorn and claim the money. Last year we had 33 try in the milking shorthorn class claiming $694.00 out of $800 00 offered by the State Fair. ■ To my mind that is wrong. One phase of this of which we have been talking, which we considered in the office this forenoon- it seems to me that this body will have to take the matter in hand and decide whether or not we ought to abolish the Milking Shorthorn class. Personally I think it is a wise thing to do. Before I get through I am going to make a motion to get this before the house that we do abolish the milking shorthorn class. Now in regard to the Short - liorn Polled, a breed that has had some new classes, had some new money because that breed is being promoted. We want to serve the </seg>

I don't want to be accused of taking any action toward any class that will work any hardship on any breeder who wants to introduce any breed that has proven itself to be worthy oi attention and that it can be successfully raised in Nebraska. But I say we should dispense with the milking shorthorn class in this premium list. Therefore. Mr. President, I move that the milking shorthorn class be stricken from the -vpreniium list, beginning with this year. Motion seconded. By PRESIDENT LAMB: The report on the Live Stock Division of the Premium List was made last night and was adopted. I think u motion would be in order to reopen that division of the report before taking this up. By MR. A. H. MILLER, Washington Co.: I now make a motion to reconsider the action of yesterday, then take this up. Seconded. By PRESIDENT LAMB: It has been moved and seconded that we reconsider the adoption of the Live Stock part of the Premium Re - vision report as adopted yesterday. All in favor of that signify by saying Aye; opposed, No. Motion carried and so ordered. We will now take up Mr. Tolen's motion. By MR. TOLEN: As to that motion before you vote, I want to say that I am not against any breed or any breeders. I like to have every man feel perfectly free to express himself on this departure from the present list. It is my thought that the best interests of everybody concerned and affected by this departure should express themselves, so I would like to hear from those who might not see as I do on the matter, and I want them to feel free to express them - selves, either for or against my proposition. That is the only way to get such a matter properly before the house, to have those who know about it and who are interested in the breed, present their views. MR. ROE, Vally County: I hate to take exception to what my rriend Tolen has advanced, but personally I believe that the best producing cow for the average farmer in Nebraska is something like the Milking Shorthorn — that is a dual purpose cow. I don't know whether striking that out is going to have an effect on that or not. I just simply believe that something of a dual purpose serves more farmers than a strictly dairy cow. By MR. TOLEN: I want to assure Mr. Roe I don't want to be misunderstood of speaking disparingly of a good breeding cow that is a good milker. In proposing to strike this class out it doesn't mean we should quit raising a good red cow that gives a lot of milk yet which I don't feel is a breed that develops a pure bred industry. The idea in striking this out is because the milking shorthorn places a dairy cow and a beef cow registered under the same Associa - tion, as&lt; breeding shorthorns. In that breed, both cows get an ad- </seg>
            <seg id="p076">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE vantage of being shown in the other class and then being shown In the milking class. She isn't a good show animal if she has a big udder. She goes into the milking class and claims this money when in reality she is a beef animal. The same thing applies to the dairy type. Of course we have taken other action by which starting next year she will be required to show her practical performance record as well as be classified by her type. She must then have a production record cf 300 pounds before she" can be entered in this class. This milking shorthorn class may be able to do that but; the thing I am getting at in this — to develop a breed type that will give better production with - out wanting to be misunderstood or misquoted as having any hostile attitude toward a good milking cow. This does not prevent having a good milking cow in the shorthorn breed. We want everyone to feel that the State Fair intends to encourage breeding of the two types. By AIR. E. J. MITCHELL, Thayer Co. : I am not exactly up on this as much as I was a few years ago. But I know that the Shorthorn breed of cattle, from our experience with it in this state, has proven that it is a great dual purpose breed. I don't see why it should be divided, but why not throw those together and enter them in one class, where it is discriminating against milking shorthorns. We wouldn't want to divide the Red Polled. By PERRY REED, Hamilton Co.: I have been one of the men on the Board who have been opposed to striking out that section from the Premium List, but after talking lit over with a number of men who are interested along this line, as to this proposal, I have made up my mind that the thing to do is to cut this out. I don't believe one man should have a privilege over another if he hasn't chosen one decisive course and resorts to a sort of camoflouge. I am for breeds of this kind, they are the kind of cattle I raise, but I think they ought to stand by themselves, so I am in favor of cutting this out. MR. CHARLES GRAFF, Cuming Co.: Mr. Chairman, first I want to have you fellows understand that this man Toleh and Senator Reed have taken a stand on this convention floor which comes as a surprise to me. When it comes to dealing with anything like this, you fellows know I am not overly modest as a rule, but modesty many times has kept me from making statements along that line. I wish the other fellow well. I am for him. Any breeder of live stock who is trying to perfect an Improvement I want him to be con - sidered as a benefactor of the country. For eighteen years I have been President of a National Record Association. For years prior to that, I was a Director in that Association's Board and for a quarter of a century I haven't failed to attend the International Live Stock Show. I have seen these cattle and taken pleasure in observing them. My lather back in Illinois, when I was a youngster was raising Shorthorn cattle. They were not the Milking Shorthorn. They were just Short - horns. There were many good milkers among them. </seg>
            <seg id="p077">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Just as I stated to you this morning when I had the floor before they have worked that breed around into three breeds. No doubt there are some good Shorthorn breeders who believe in the Polled stock In cattle, and have followed the good English Red Polled. They began to talk about freaks and call them freaks. They were born without horns. Pretty soon they became recorded as Polled Short - horns. Now they come into shows as these men say as Milking Short - horns. She is a cow that is made on the order of a hard rock, loose coarse and bony. She looks like a regular beef animal more than she does a milking shorthorn, when she is of that type. For a generation she has been raised on a nurse cow oftentimes of another breed, then they are called Beef Shorthorns. You have heard the beef breeders of the country talk about these wonderful shorthorn herds of beef cattle. If you hunt up the records of this type of beef cattle you will find quite a delegation of nurse cattle, that show many of these cattle in those breeds have to have two nurse cows, come with them to the fairs. Many of them have come to a point where they are very shy and breeders find they sometimes produce little scrawny weakling calves now and then. Now I want you fellows to know that our people tor a quarter century to my recollection and knowledge have fought the idea of trying to segregate this old English breed of Red Polled. We call them dual purpose. We are not ashamed to show them and back them up. I believe we have got enough people in our Association, constructive breeders, of this country that they are going to keep them as such, the good old dual purpose cow that satisfies our average rarmer better than any animal of the bovine species. The gentleman from Valley County says he believes in the good old Shorthorn milk cow, but that they have ruined her long ago. When they get down to the good old foundation of the original Short - horns you find they have been breeding for the last 150 or 200 years. We will pay no attention to color, because we know what their color 1? — it Is red and white and roan. When you tinker with those colors you are playing with fire in the Shorthorn breed, every time, because that is stamped into that breed. You can't breed it out. I remember as much as thirty years ago when some of the popular breeders of Shorthorn cattle in this country were advertising their best breeding animals out of their herds, by referring to those animals by a dis - tinction of being red — so red became popular! They found out that an animal having a uniform color — say red, was more attractive. They tried to outdo other breeds, such as Angus, Red Polled breed, and Hereford breeds. You know the marks of those types, but you just can't monkey with the color. When you do you sacrifice both, don't you? I am glad to -have- this matter come up. The Shorthorn breeders, however, should be willing to stand on their own bottoms. We don't want to spread out very much further. We have three divisions now recording all in the same book — in the same record. It seems as though </seg>
            <seg id="p078">KKI'OnT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE t it is a little unfair to come into our shows and want three classes and want them liberally. I didn't ask you for that. I did not have the guts to ask for what these men are asking for just because as I said to you in the beginning, my modesty forbids, but as long as the matter came up, I want to get it out of my system. By MR. R. WIDLE, Nance Co.: It isn't my purpose to ask you to strike out anything but if possible I am going to do everything in my power, but whenever you want to classify so as to have any pre - ferred breed, I am not in favor of that. In part we have to agree with Mr. Graft's remarks— in part only. You know Mr. Graff and Mr. Graff marketed Red Polled cattle when I was handling Shorthorn cows. However, I don't go to Shorthorns to the extent that I want a pre - ferred breed. It is true this is a duplication to a certain extent. But I don't agree that Polled. Durhams have a third class there. Polled Durhams have a Record Association, and are entirely to themselves; they are not the same class as Shorthorns, or a third class of Shorthorn. Milk - ing Shorthorns are recorded in the records of the American Short - horn Breeders' Association, and no other place. I just want to bring out the capability of this breed. For instance, former Governor Shall - enberger has demonstrated it. It is with pride that Nebraska people know we have a herd in this state which has produced such a glorious record. I want to Impress this on you. Just this morning there was carried in the press an item that one of his animals again had won a national championship and brought further glory to Nebraska. Complaint is made that our present rule is working a hardship on some exhibitors. Why, because under this rule a man can bring down an animal that he could show as a beef animal, take money on it in the beef class, and bring it back down and show it in another class as a dairy cow. That may work some duplication. I cite this as isn illustration. You can take a herd and under the present rule you can keep a man from showing in a certain class, the best he has but he can show as a regular beef class, then put some of them out In the pasture and bring them in, bring the balance of his herd down here and show as a dairy brped. Certain cows should be shown as wet cows, and we must give the exhibitor the privilege of showing them as wet cows; then they come Jback later and show as dairy cows. They may not be milking then but they have the privilege of show - ing here as dairy cows. "It seems this Is left as rather optional with them. We are giving two shows to the same breeder and he may take udvantage of it. For that reason I feel I should be In favor of strik - ing out the class and not having milking shorthorns. By MR. TOLEN: I am mighty glad to have heard Mr. Wldle make the remarks he did, for he has served in a capacity where he could more closely observe this situation. I am glad also to have heard the remarks of Mr. Graff. Before he spoke I thought I could visualize how our grandchildren would some time serve on this board </seg>
            <seg id="p079">KEPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE HOARD OF AfiRICUI/TUKE and be proud of our action. Charley convinced me. 1 would like to hear from some of the producers, and breeders. Frank Walker has been a heavy breeder of Shorthorns for a long time. Let's get Frank's views on the matter, he has been a showman and might give us a f&gt;lant on the matter from both angles. MR. FRANK WALKER, Lancaster County: Mr. Miller just asked me what my opinion might be on this. Of course, I have no axe to grind. I have been quite a breeder of Shorthorn cattle. At the present time I am not interested in Shorthorns or any dairy breed of any kind. My. first remark to Mr. Miller was that I thought we might be getting into a lot of hot water If we cut this out. Of course, if we make the right move it don't matter how much hot water we get into because we know the Fair Managers want to make the right move and move in the right direction. I am inclined to agree with my friend, Mr. Roe. Of course you know I have watched the Shorthorn to some extent. They are a very popular breed among the farmers and I am inclined to think that if you cut out this breed it may give them a black eye. I am also inclined to think Mr. Widle was a little bit mistaken as to the Polled Short - horn class having their own record association or record book. I have given numerous record for Polled cattle and it costs 50c more, but i hey are all recorded in one Association. You can take them and show them back and forth. You can do that, have them in one division one time and in another the next time. I think it would be discouraging at this time to cut this out. I believe that by leaving it in, it would tend to help Improve the milking breed in quality. My opinion at the present time would be not to cut it out. By MR. R. WIDLE, Nance Co.: t want to correct Mr. Walker's remark about the Association. They are registered by themselves and also in the Shorthorn Association/You can register the single standard Polled Shorthorn. They have a record of their own. Howeyer, if you want to, you can record the same animal in the Shorthorn record. You can make him a double standard registry. By MR. FRANK WALKER: I would like to ask Mr. Widle to rite the name of the Secretary and the name of the President of this Association for Polled Shorthorns. I have promoted the interest of Polled Shorthorns, but I don't believe he can give me the names of the President or Secretary of any association outside of the Short - horn Association where he can make such a record. By MR. WIDLE: I will give them. By MR. CHAS. GRAFF: I believe I might throw a little light on that. You will .notice in our premium list that the American Short - horn Breeders' Association put some money into our fair here, for the Beef Shorthorns, for the Milking Shorthorns and for the Polled Shorthorns. The Shorthorn Record association recognizes these three distinct breeds — though they are really one and the same. With this </seg>
            <seg id="p080">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE one exception, they used to have a distinction between what they failed the Double Standard Shorthorn and the Single Standard Short - horn. The Double Standard Shorthorn in those days and not so long ago either, was a Polled animal.. It just happened to be a Poll. It was then eligible to record in the American Shorthorn record. The Single Standard was not. The Single Standard in fact carried a great deal more Polled blood than the Double Standard animal did. You could bank on a single standard Polled Shorthorn producing a larger percentage of Polled cattle. The double standard was just guess work as to how they would produce whether they would put any horns on or leave them off. I don't know what became of those separate breeds finally, or whether they have finally been dropped In the American Shorthorn book or hot. But I think Mr. Wldle will correct himself later on and he will find as to Polled Durham they are eligible to record in the American Shorthorn Breeders' book. By PRESIDENT LAMB: We would like to have a word from Mr. McLaughlln. By H. J. MCLAUGHLIN, Hall Co., and State Dept. Agriculture: I would rather not get into this discussion, for I am a breeder of Hereford cattle. I think this was put in the premium list two years ago. I think I attended some meetings of the Board of Managers when this discussion was on as to the original action. There was Quite a demand presented to put this in— to install this new class. 1 doubt, gentlemen, whether it pays you to keep up these different classifications for one breed of cattle. You have some other things to think of. You men have been studying our financial situation and have studied our financial statement just put out here yesterday. We built this past year a wonderful grandstand. We pledged certain of our receipts to pay for that. Our expenses are running higher than they have in the past and perhaps higher than they should run. We must retrench somewhere. I think the Board of Managers have come to fully realize this. They were very lucky last year that they made their obligations keep out of the red. I think we can retrench some here and do as little damage to the industry as possible. On the other hand, maybe they have an argument for an increase in this particular phase, as to the Shorthorn Cattle in Nebraska. I would not deny that. I don't agree wtth this taking the cattle out of a herd that shows in a certain class and putting them in a different classification to make a double showing. I don't believe that is fair. By MR. PRANK WALKER, Lancaster Co.: I suppose the Board of Managers have considered the Polled Shorthorns in with the Beef Shorthorns, instead of the Milking Shorthorns. I think if the Milking Shorthorns be left In the thought just came to me possibly the Polled Shorthorns might be put In with the Milking Shorthorns. By PRESIDENT LAMB: In answer to your question, Mr. Walker, we have never considered that part of it, it never came up before. </seg>
            <seg id="p081">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE By MR. HUNT, Otoe County: I am not a breeder of cattle at all but the county from which I come has a great many Shorthorn cattle, a great many Milking Shorthorns. I know from those breeders they are trying to improve this type of Milking Shorthorn. I thought it might be possible you are going to meet a new difficulty under the new rule for where they have animals they are entered as dairy they must hereafter attain a certain standard of production record in order to be admitted. In that case where they have a genuine milking animal they would qualify and won't that be sufficient barrier against their doubling even if the present rule permits it? By PRESIDENT LAMB: Are you ready for the question? By MR. TOLEN: I would like to state that this Board does not desire to discriminate between any breeds. What we want to do is to systematize the different breeds and get them where they will be fostered and promoted and get the very most out of every breed. We haven't any notion whatever of cutting out this Milking Shorthorn class, for instance, if we can be shown enough Milking Shorthorns to make it just to keep the classification. The Dairy people have been after us for more money and grad - ually we have increased their allotment. We hope we have increased it sufficiently that we can keep on having such a wonderful dairy show. -Take Poland-China hogs, for instance — not many years ago that breed was a small factor in Nebraska. Now that is not so. We ask for this breed to' be stricken out because there is not a justifi - cation for its retention. If such an increase comes about that justifies it, I know this Board will be only too glad to reinstate this breed. I renew my motion that the classification of Milking Shorthorns be stricken from the premium list this year. (Rising vote called for). By PRESIDENT LAMB: All in favor of this motion will please rise and remain standing until counted. Contrary, likewise. Vote announced as 34 for said motion and others not necessary to be counted.

GRAFF, Bancroft: In looking over the ballot, 1 find there is no opposition in any one of the six Congressional Districts. The candidates nominated are all running without opposi - tion. Our by-laws say they must be elected by ballot, gentlemen, but 1 don't see why we should spend an hour orjinore here to go through that sort of a farce. . I wonder if it is legal, Mr. President, if this convention would vote to suspend the rules and declare and instruct that the Chairman of the meeting, or the Secretary, be authorized to cast unanimously the ballot for these candidates. That would save us a lot of work that will be necessary. otherwise. Could anyone question its legality if done that way? We have a lawyer around here who perhaps could tell us if that is legal or not. By MR. JACKSON: I think the idea is a good one. By MR. E. R. PURCELL: I think this is the first time since I have been a member this question has come up. I have never seen a precedent for it. This Board and its Board of Managers are handling big business for the State. The by-laws provide for vote by ballot. I think we should comply with them.

While I have a chance I want to say another thing, gentlemen, in regard to this very unusual recapitulation that has just been passed around.

I think he was from Nuckolls County. While he was at that time a little new too in this work we found he was pretty active as a fair man. He served with me in numerous capacities and he has moved along in fair work until we began to find he was a rather unusual man in many ways in this fair work. After he had gone on through the Presidents chair, he later- on became Secretary, then we discovered that he was a most unusual man in many more ways. His work In this organization is very outstanding; his co-operation with the county fairs and their organization in this state— his co-operation with the City of Lincoln and Its Chamber of Commerce; and with the other representative cities of our state; and the interests he has succeeded in arousing from so many different organizations is all very unusual. I feel that in presenting his name for re-election as Secretary for the coming year that I am presenting a man who is outstanding among the State Fair officials and Secretaries of the United States.

By GEORGE JACKSON: Mr. President, and men of this Con - vention, I want to thank you for your continued confidence in me. The only thing I regret is that my wife wasn't here to hear those nice things you have said. I don't want to say what I am going to say in these next few minutes in any spirit of braggadocla or anything like that. I don't want you to take it that way. But I feel I am the oldest man in the State of Nebraska in fair work experience — perhaps in the United States. I think with the exception of about 15 years of my life, the first ten years in childhood and five years j that I spent as a stage driver in the Rocky Mountains, I have been connected with fairs in some way, as an exhibitor, a Secretary of county fair, In which capa - city I served so long down at Nelson that! I thought I owned the institution, Secretary of a Poultry show, and then into the work of this organization, working up through every department of the State Board of Agriculture. But out of all this experience I may have had I find I have got a lot to learn as yet. I never go to one of our county fairs but what I get ideas that I can study over and put into effect at the Nebraska State Fair. In this age of advancement in agriculture, in fact in the advance - ment of everything, the State Fair and fairs In general have got to be made more and more educational. Every activity of the fair must be made very educational. We spend a lot of time and money on the county fairs of Ne - braska. I am as much interested In the 83 county fairs of Nebraska as I am In the State Fair. We . are living in an age of broad vision and co-operation. I get some very valuable suggestions from Mr. Brokaw here in his organization at the Extension Service at the Col - lege of Agriculture, and through his good staff of extension workers. </seg>
            <seg id="p087">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE There is nothing that this State Board can ask from the College of Agriculture within reason and within their power that they do not provide. Anything we want through the College of Agriculture it is ours for the asking. The County Fairs are dependent upon us and we are dependent upon them. They co-operate and work with us and r.pon their behalf we co-operate with the College of Agriculture. Our work thus becomes more educational through the co-operation of these organizations; we have a personal contact with these men out here at the College of Agriculture and appreciate their work all over the state and they furnish us much inspiration. We are going to continue to grow. There is one other thing I would like to speak about. I feel myself and a lot of other fellows have told me that we do have one of the leading fairs in the United States, we hold the leading banquet in Lincoln but hereafter I would like to see you fellows bring your wives with you. I am sure this gathering would inspire them to go home and work with you for your lounty fair. I don't know as I have any more, to say only again I want to thank you for your continued confidence. Then I want you to renew your acquaintance with those who furnish me so much assistance and tortify my ability. Morris Reichenback, will you stand up? There is the man who keeps our grounds in shape and has them ready for the Fair. Then as Clark Oberlies said last night, Mrs. Gadd and Mrs Graham, along with Morris, are the ones who put on such a success - ful fair— in spite of George Jackson. Now there is a great deal to that little jest. Because when the gates open out there Morris has everything ready even if it means working nights as well as days for some time ahead of then. My office force also has everything ready then, for this meeting arid at all times. That is the reason the State I- air is making such a success. I am getting a lot of credit not due to me. I want to pass it around, I get more than I deem proper You come into our office and they can put their hands right on anything you want to know about the next fair we are planning or the last fair we have had. So we want to pass these honors around to Morris and our office force. * " By CHAS. GRAFF: Mr. Chairman, our friend Jackson said he was sorry that Mrs. Jackson, wasn't present to hear the nice things said about George by Emerson Purcell. I am rather glad she wasn't for she might be inquiring into why this close fraternity of mutual ndmiration between these two individuals. I don't want to expialn here the why and wherefore of this close tie between these two, so we will let that drop right here. By MR. PORTWOOD, Nuckolls Co.: I want to second what Mr. Purcell has said about Mr. Jackson. I want to say it another way, that if Mrs. Jackson were present when this was said this morning she would have appreciated all Mr. Purcell said. Of course she might have felt a little like a colored widow who went to the funeral and </seg>
            <seg id="p088">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE I ' heard the darky pastor say such wonderful things in eulogy of the deceased that she stood it as long as she could, then she whispered to one of her four or five children and told him to sneak up in front and see if that really was his father in the coffin. I fear Mrs. Jack - son wouldn't have recognized George as being the object of those remarks. George has been working on and with our county fair out there for about forty years. I know how considerate George can be and I felt better when he gave those remarks about his assistants this morn - ing. I remember he took Morris down to Dallas with him, so Morris could observe his own special line of work. I hope George stays with us for about seventy years longer. By MR. E. R.

By PRESIDENT LAMB: At this time it becomes my duty to an - nounce the appointment by your President! of four members of the Board of Managers, for your approval. I will so name Mr. A. H.

During this same period of time this organization has staged the twenty-nine fairs, paid out for. premiums during this time the sum of $950,772, and have put back into the grounds in the way of per - manent improvements and upkeep a total of $870,875. You will note that from our receipts during this twenty-nine year period we have paid out $80,629 more for premiums than the total state appropriation for grounds and buildings. The Nebraska State Fair is conceded by all to be the greatest advertising medium in Nebraska. We are proud of its record. It not only advertises our resources, but finds buyers for our products. During the twenty-nine years' residence in Lincoln it has developed to such an extent that the institution is valued at one million and a Quarter dollars. </seg>

            <seg id="p111">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION ANNUAL KEPOHT OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE NKHICASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION Delivered at the 21»t Annual Meeting, Lincoln, January, 103O WAYLAND W. MAGEE, Bennington, Nebr. This short summary of the activities of your Society, compiled »&gt;y the President, showing the work that we have carried on for the past calendar year may seem to some of you farmers an unnecessary procedure. However, in the light of our experience your officers have thought it more than justifies the effort and time which it takes, Insomuch as this summary will go into the record and be printed with our Annual Report. As you know, the annual report is made available to our ever increasing circle of friends and members, many of whom cannot be with us today. It will also serve to enlighten other state societies as to what has been- done in Nebraska, and I can add that I do not think Nebraska has the poorest story to tell of the twenty-one State Societies who are carrying on this work. It will also furnish our one hundred and thirty-three new members with e. synopsis of our activities and encourage them to lend a hand. As you all know this is to be the twentyrfirst birthday meeting of the Society, and. of course, will mark our coming of age. With our coming of age we have taken on increased responsibilities. I congratulate you on the large attendance and I can assure you that there has been provided a very interesting program to be carried out in the meetings that are ahead of you. We who make our living from the soil have not in the past heen in a position to be masters of our fate, but as I read the signs cf the times I believe that there is a brighter future in store for Agriculture. From the time when the memory of man runneth not to the contrary, we farmers have been in the habit of hauling our grain to the elevators or markets and there asking the question, "How much will you give for it?" and then taking our returns and going to the general store to purchase a pound of tea or a sack of sugar, have again reverted to the old expression, "How much?" In ether words our product has been sold in a buyer's market and we have bought bur supplies in a seller's market. This condition we have, as a class, been able to stand because our land values have steadily risen and when we found it necessary to retire from the farm, land which we had acquired at small value was readily salable for enough </seg>
            <seg id="p112">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE to make the necessary nest-egg on which we could . retire. This con - dition has continued up to 1921 when the great post-war deflation set in. As the farming class, existing between other and better or - ganized groups of Society, we have. been forced of late to see our land values decline and our income curtailed to a point where our stand - ards of living have been threatened. To meet this condition, as I see it, two general lines of thought have been developed. The pol - iticians naturally capitalized the opportunity to bring about a changed condition through legislation, and' a heroic attempt is being made by the administration to put the producer in charge of the marketing of his product. This I believe should be done and will be done in time, though I do not look for It to come about without a long and severe struggle. The change In our economic condition will be slow, t ut I do not believe that the American farmer can be driven to pea - santry, and I do believe in the work of the Federal Farm Board which I urge you, as thinking farmers, to support at every oppor - tunity. ■ Relation of Program to Profits The other line of thought which has been In the minds of your officers in forming the program for the Crop Growers' Association, tor want of a better name I am going to call a. "cost cutting program." We, as a Society, have in the years since '21 attempted to increase our income, as a class, by taking advantage of the tools at our dis - posal and increasing our return by cutting our costs. As I have said before in these annual reports. Agriculture has been unquestionably out of step with Industry, and the monetary returns of the farmer have not kept pace with the returns received by the better organ - ized groups. We still believe that the outstanding economic problems to be settled by the best minds in the country today Involve produc - tion and marketing. Not so much nowadays in Itself is it the mark - eting and distributing end of the problem that we as Crop Growers have emphasized, as it is the question of cost of production in sup - plying that market. In other words, the question now with us as Crop Growers is one of getting a better return in dollars per acre rather than in bushels per acre. In any attempt to increase the farmer's income through a cost - cutting program, we have two main lines .developed. We can cut our cost of production: First, by the work we have so well been carrying on of directing the attention of the farmer to the necessity of using improved strains of seed, and thereby getting more bushels per acre without an increased overhead and as making each bushel cost less and the acre return more. Our second channel of attack has been to attempt to direct the farmer's attention to the use of improved methods of farming wherein he avails himself of the work of the implement men and the Agri - cultural Experimental Stations in practicing more economic methods </seg>
            <seg id="p113">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION or production. This means we have dealt with soil treatment and mechanical management. With these two major projects in mind Improved seeds and larger yields through the use of better soils and multiple row machinery — let us see what we have done last year. Certified Seed Work The points which will be brought out by our program at this meeting, and which have been emphasized by our work throughout the year last past, will show the part the Crop Growers have taken in this seed certification work, both for small grain and alfalfa seed. For your information, I am listing the acreage certified and the es - timated yield: Total Bu. of Variety No. of Growers Var. Certified Nebr.

Under the program of increasing our yield per acre thru better soils program and directing attention to types of corn, we have con - ducted a Corn and Bean Show at Scottsbluff, Nebraska, from De - cember 11-13, 1929, working in conjunction with the Western Ne - braska Organized Agriculture, and, we have In this building the An - nual Corn Show of the Society now in progress. Utility Grain Shows In connection with the subject of Corn Shows, it might be well to draw attention to the fact that, there has been some questions in the minds of your Vice Presidents and officers as to the desirability of spending the money of the Society In conducting these strictly show-type Corn Shows and, while we are not prepared to disturb the established custom at this time, yet we are watching with a great deal </seg>
            <seg id="p114">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE of interest the development of the new type of Corn Show wherein the emphasis is placed on other considerations than the pretty ear. In this same connection the opening wedge for a purely utilitarian show has been made. A small grain show has been started, and you will note in the entry blanks and rules for this year's Corn. Show that there is a new class of small grains, especially in Nebraska 60 Wheat, Burt 293 Oats, Nebraska 21 Oats, Comfort Barley, Marcus Wheat, and Treibi Barley. This show is to be open to- the growers of certified Beed, and the competing samples will be those sent in by the growers for the sample of threshed grain required under the rules or our Association. The samples submitted must be representative of the certified seed as It will be offered to the public. " The purpose of this utility show is to eliminate the customary hand-picked and ar - tificially prepared exhibit, which have emphasized the pretty corn ear or hand-picked sample, and have been of very little practical value. The exhibits will be judged by competent judges from the standpoint of seed stock samples, and is, in the opinion of the officers of your Society, a distinct step in. advance in the program of crop improve - ment work. International Crop Improvement Association Your Society has also cooperated in holding the meetings of Organized Agriculture at Scottsbluff and at Lincoln. Again the of - ficers have taken part in the meetings of the International Crop Im - provement Association and the National Seed Council . meetings held at Chicago at the time of the Annual International Live Stock, Grain and Hay Show. It perhaps would not be out of place to record at this juncture, and in this connection, that so admirably has our Secre - tary, Mr. Paul H. Stewart, served the International Crop Improvement Association as Secretary through a series of years that his good work has been recognized, and at the last meeting he was elected President of their organization, thus bringing another honor and recognition to Nebraska. In order that the Crop Growers could show their appreciation for the cooperation of County Agents in this crop and soils improve - ment work, we have, as a Society, offered during the past year two trips to the International Hay and Grain Show at Chicago to the County Agents submitting the best report on their activities along these lines. This year County Agents Hecht and Nelson have won the trip and were in attendance at the Chicago meetings, where they doubtless received inspiration and instruction which will aid in carry - ing forward this program.

This year we had 230 entries, and 135 men finished up. It is interesting to note that of the twelve men who have grown more than 100 bushels of corn per acre since our program began In 1924, seven are Included In the list of men who finished up this year; that is, we have had only five men grow more than 100 bushels to the acre of corn in the last five years, while this year we had seven men get over a 100 bushel yield. This very fact suggests to your ofllcers the desirability of establishing a 100J Bushel Corn Yield Club of Nebraska growers, the prerequisite to entrance in which shall be the official production of at least 100 bushels of corn on one acre of land In one of these Ten Acre Corn Yield Con - tests we have been carrying on. It is needless to say that our rec - ords are in such shape that such a club could be established, and its right to membership made retroactive. The compiled reports of these Ten Acre Corn Yield Contests, are greatly sought after, as they furnish the best modern, up to the min - ute evidence on the costs of producing corn under Nebraska condi - tions. They point the way to the best practices and trends as brought out by the compilation of their records. As a Society we have continued the aiding of a judging team from the College of Agriculture in defraying the expense of their trip while representing the College in judging field crops in the contests con - ducted by the Hay and Grain Show at Chicago International. The finances of the Society were never in better condition. As has been heretofore expressed by our Treasurer, we have money in both pockets — the one the aid we receive from the State Board of Agriculture, which money is to be used only for the specific purpose of an educational nature; and the money In the pocket which we receive from the self-imposed tax placed on seed sales by certified seed growers, and which fund can be used for the advancement of the business, or work, so long as it compiles with the objects as set cut in our Articles of Incorporation. From this short summary of the work of the year, you will see that the anual report was duly printed and mailed in accordance with, the provisions of the statute; the list of field inspected seeds of small grains has been prepared and distributed widely for both our field seeds and alfalfa. Shows and meetings have been conducted, and the Treasurer's report shows that we have money and I know we have energy with which to carry on into the new year. </seg>
            <seg id="p116">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE IN WHICH NEBRASKA DO YOU FARM? HAROLD HEDGES Nebraska is our state and we are Interested in learning more about it. The group assembled here today represents the farming industry of Nebraska. I wonder how well you know your state agri - culturally. You have perhaps a general idea of what the agriculture of the state is like. For example, you know JHBBH^^HBMHl 'hat cattle raising is the main enterprise in |||SffiHHgHE9HK|| the Sand Hill section; you have heard of the j^VHH corn and live stock produced in northeast ip^Ht* iSl Nebraska. In southern and western Nebraska B- 1 you would expect to find broad fields of P§jBfrjf '^jMh wheat. Then of course in the section or the f|il|K&lt; %. ' fiBl st ite in which you are located you are quite HaWK* '^TT*.^BbI fa »n"iar with the type of farming that is pW^ML followed. You hear it said repeatedly that Ne- BV braska is an agricultural state. The fact that BktAaSi nearly 98 per cent of the area of the state is reported as land in farms is sufficient proof Harold hedges °* that statement. Agriculture is a very broad term," however — broad enough to include the production of strawberries on a few square rods of soil and cat - tle raising on a 30.000 acre ranch. Perhaps farming in Nebraska ooes not present the extremes that it does in some states, yet there is considerable lack of uniformity. Nebraska a Varied State In northeastern Nebraska we find Farmer Brown on a quarter section farm raising corn, oats and other feed crops, raising hogs and feeding cattle. In southern Nebraska, Farmer Green raises corn, and perhaps some oats and barley, but also has a large acreage in wheat. Going farther west in the state, we might stop at the 640 here farm of Farmer White, where wheat is the main crop. In north central Nebraska, we would run across the big Sand Hill ranch of Farmer Black and find a well-bred cow herd producing calves and yearlings which go to eastern feed lots. Why is the agriculture of the state so varied in nature? Why l;as one type of farming developed in one part of the state,' another type in another section? The reason is obvious — conditions are not uniform in every part of the state. We may consider that there are about three sets of factors that are accountable for the agriculture of the different sections developing along different lines. First, we have the natural factors, such as soil, temperature and rainfall. The soil is quite variable in the state, and the same is true </seg>
            <seg id="p117">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION ot temperature and rainfall. All of these things work to influence what the type of farming is to. be. The second. set of factors are the biological — such things as insects and plant and animal diseases. While such things as tuberculosis, wheat smut or the Hessian fly may be controlled by proper methods yet they Influence what type of. farming may be most practicable. The third set of factors to be considered are the economic factors. One I might mention is trans - portation. Transportation costs may and do influence the choice between selling corn and feeding it to live stock. By considering these many factors, perhaps we can answer such questions as: Why .Is it that wheat is. grown in southwestern Ne - braska and not in the northeastern part of the state? Why do we find nearly 40 per cent of the land in corn In northeastern Nebraska and only 30 per cent in corn in southern Nebraska? Soil, tempera - ture, rainfall, and many more of the things I have mentioned are the determining factors. Their influence shows up in two ways, at least — in yields and in production costs. The amount of rainfall has its influence on yields. Plant diseases reduce yields or make neces - sary expensive control measures. A heavy -soil is more expensive to I-low than a lighter soil. Wet, low-lying land may require drainage — a costly operation. hich Plains r ' 1*T^V_ ■^ffi^yS*" 0 HILL CWT1.C EJAMcklNI A J T""j»™5~j\ 7.

T)*pe of Farming Areas Tlius you see when we study yields, we are studying the effects of the numerous factors I have just mentioned. We are tlien able to explain in part why the prevailing type of farming in one part of the state differs from that in another section. A careful study ot crop acreages and livestock numbers in every part of the state, has made it possible to divide Nebraska into nine rather definite "type of farming' areas. (See the map.) Perhaps before I go any farther I should explain what we mean by a "type of farming" area. </seg>
            <seg id="p118">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE It is a region In which the farmers are generally doing about the bame thing. That doesn't mean there is absolute uniformity by any means, because there may be considerable variation from farm to farm. However, the fact that the farmers are operating under rather similar natural and economic conditions means that there will likely be rather definite similarity in their farming practices. There are differences in farmers, of course. There are dif - ferences in the amount of capital they have to work with; differences in their ability; differences in their likes and dislikes. Yet, despite such differences, we will find the farming conditions and practices in a certain area enough alike to designate it as a "type of farm - ing" area and to give it a descriptive name. You will notice that the name given each of the nine areas into which the state is divided is somewhat descriptive of its location in the state and of the type o£ farming which prevails there. For example, Area I, the North - eastern Intensive Meat Producing Area, is so named because of the importance of the hog and cattle enterprises as sources of Income. You may wonder what Information we have available to guide us in separating the state Into these 9 areas. The state and federal bureau of agricultural statistics have data on crop acreages for nearly every farm of the state, which Is obtained each year by the precinct assessors. This information was worked up on precinct basis to give us one means of determining the various "types of farming" areas. The livestock data were on a county basis. On an acreage basis, corn is the most important cultivated crop of the state. If we were to draw a. line across the state from the northeast corner to the southwest corner, we would find that most of the corn is grown to the south and east of that line. Northeastern Nebraska, centering in Burt, Cumlng and Wayne counties, is the most intensive corn producing area of the state. The lower Platte valley and the southeast corner of the state are smaller areas with a high proportion of the farm area In corn. Most of the wheat is produced south of the Platte river, but with a substantial acreage, largely spring wheat, In the Panhandle section of western Nebraska. The area or most Intensive wheat pro - duction is In the southwestern counties lying between Kimball and Perkins counties. Another area in which the proportion of land in wheat is high centers In Kearney and Phelps counties. Oats Is most extensively grown in northeastern Nebraska, but is an important crop throughout the eastern third of the state. Alfalfa, like oats, is most widely grown in the eastern third of the state, but the areas where it occupies the highest proportion of the farm land are in the upper North Platte valley — the Irrigated Area — and In the Platte valley In Dawson and Buffalo counties. Wild hay is the most important forage crop in the area on the south and east borders of the Sand Hills. Holt and Rock counties are the center of commercial </seg>
            <seg id="p119">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS 1 ASSOCIATION prairie hay production. Sugar beets are au important cash crop of the irrigated area of western Nebraska. Potatoes are grown as a commercial crop mainly in the irrigated section of Scotts Bluff and southern Sioux counties and in Box Butte county. Distribution 'of Livestock The several classes of live stock, like the crops, are not uniformly distributed over the state. (See the table.) Cattle are found in largest numbers in Area I, the Northeastern Intensive Meat Produc - ing Area. Considered from the standpoint of sources of income, they are most important In the Sand Hill Cattle Ranching Area where they are the main and often the sole source of income. In Area I cattle feeding is an important business while Area 6 is largely devoted to producing cattle which move to eastern feedlots for finishing, j Hogs are most numerous in northeast Nebraska In Area 1, but also very Important in southeastern Nebraska in Area 2. Moving westward across the state, hogs decrease in number and importance, being least numerous In the Sand Hills because of the scarcity of teed grains. ■ Sheep feeding rather than sheep raising is of some importance in certain local areas of the state, notably at several points in the North Platte and Platte valleys and in east central Nebraska. No part ol the state can be called strictly a dairy section or a poultry sec - tion, yet both enterprises are important sources of Income for many farmers of the state. Dairy cows and poultry are most numerous in .Areas 1, 2 and 3 in southern and eastern Nebraska. From the preceeding discussion, you may get a general idea of the distribution of the various crops and kinds of live stock over the slate. From the standpoint of types of farming our main interest is in how the crop and livestock enterprises are combined into farm organizations' or types. Perhaps I can give you a brief description of the prevailing types of farming found in eaqh of the 9 areas into which we have divided the state, bringing out some of the differences between areas. The Areas of Nebraska Area 1 we have called the Northeastern Intensive Meat Produc - ing Area. The important grain crops are corn and oats, with 1 corn dominating in acreage. About 25 per cent of the farm land is oc - cupied by pasture and 11 per cent by hay, of which a large part is alfalfa or other, legume hay. The large volume of feed grains ana hay available, together with pasture, makes livestock an essential part of the fanning system. Cattle are needed to utilize the pasture, and cattle feeding and hog production are important enterprises which utilize the high proportion of fat producing reeds. </seg>
            <seg id="p120">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OK AGRICULTURE ■ . Area 2 is called the .Southeastern General Farming Area. Corn, oats, and pasture hay each occupy a little smaller proportion of the farm land than in Area 1, and we find that wheat has a place in the farming system. About 11 per cent of the farm area is devoted to wheat production. Beef cattle and hogs hold a less important place than in Area 1 while dairying and poultry are more important. In view of the diversity in sources of income. Area 2 may well be called a general farming section. . . » A bran crop in the Hinh Plains area of Nebraska. In Area 3, the Southern Cash Grain and Livestock Area, wheat lias gained in importance, occupying 22 per cent of the farm area. Corn is still the leading crop, however. The smaller hay and pas - ture acreages and their lower productivity account for the fewer cattle In this than in the areas to the south and east. Crop yields are quite variable in this area, and this tends to limit livestock production somewhat. In addition "to wheat, some corn is sold, especially in &gt;ears of good crops. Dairying and poultry are somewhat more im - portant among the livestock enterprises than lii Areas 1 and 2. The importance of wheat and corn as cash grains, supplementing live stock as sources of income, accounts for the name given the area. </seg>

Beef cattle take a higher place among the livestock enterprises than in Areas 1, 2, and 3, because cattle utilize the hay and pasture which occupy a larger part of the farm land than in the areas to the east and south. Dairying and hogs are important sources of income, too. Considerable sheep feed - ing is done in certain local sections along the Platte valley. ! Live - stock is more important in the northeastern than in the southwestern part of this area, while more corn is sold for cash in the latter section. Hay occupies nearly 14 per cent of the farm land in Area 5, the Central Hay and Livestock Area, and the proportion in pasture increases to more than 50 per cent. Hay is a cash crop in some sec - tions of the northern part of the area. Corn is the principal grain crop. The southern part of this area has more grain crops and less hay than the northern part. Beef cattle are most important in the livestock system, because they serve as a good means of utilizing pasture and hay, but hogs, dairy cattle and poultry are added sources of income. Area 6, the Sand Hill Cattle Ranching Area, is essentially a cattle producing region. With more than three-fourths of the land in pasture and most of the remainder in native hay, the cattle busi - ness is a logical one. -With hay and a little grain for winter feed to </seg>

Area 7, the Southwestern Wheat Area, is so named because of the high place of wheat in the farming system. There is very little hay produced. Pasture occupies 45 per cent of the farm land but is of low carrying capacity. Feed grains are less plentiful than in most other areas. Hence, live stock is less important in this area than In any other of the state. The High Plains Small Grain and Grazing Area (Area 8) has a cropping system in which the small grains predominate. Spring wheat and barley are the leading small grains. Corn is an important grain crop along the eastern border of the area. Commercial potato grow - ing in the area centers in Box Butte county. The high proportion of farm land in pasture is utilized by beef cattle and to a limited extent by sheep. This area is quite diverse in farming types and is in a period of rapid change. Area 9, the Irrigated Area, is confined in large part to Scotts Bluff county, but less extensive irrigated sections are found along the Platte valley and in other river valleys of the western half of the Mate. In the North Platte district, sugar beet production holds a high place in the cropping system, with small grains, alfalfa, potatoes corn and beans of less importance. Sheep and cattle feeding are carried on extensively to utilize the beet by-products, alfalfa and grains of the area. Dairying is gaining in importance. In a brief way, that describes the "type of farming" areas or the state. In which of these 9 Nebraskas do you farm? The bound - ary lines of the areas cannot be drawn exactly but are approximately right. If you are traveling across the state you may be interested in observing where one area changes to another. For example ingoing west from Crete, you will note a change from rolling to rather level land, a factor influencing the farming types to be found in Areas 2 and 3. After this discussion, perhaps you will realize more fully than l,efore that there are wide differences in the types of farming found in our state. Time has not permitted me to explain in detail why one area differs from another, although I have mentioned some of the factors which account for the difference. This "type of farm - ing 1 ' material we have assembled and analyzed will probably be avail - able in a short time in bulletin form. </seg>
            <seg id="p123">NEBRASKA CHOP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN THE FAKMINU (iAMK REX WILLARD, North Dakota I am not altogether sure why one from up in North Dakota should be Invited down here to discuss this problem with you. You v.'ould have been better served if the man from Montana had been able to be here instead of myself, because he is an outstanding man in this field of work and he has -recently been over in Russia. I refer to Mr. M. L. Wilson. He has been making quite an exhaustive study of farming conditions in that country and he could have brought you considerable information relating to a country about which we know very little. After I had been in the room, your chairman made a report of financial conditions of your treasury, and ended up by saying you had money in both pockets. We don't have anything like that in North Dakota and I am not sure where I am going, bo if I get too far off, you will understand the reason. I was interested in the discussion because we have been thru the same mill and it is to follow up something of what Mr. Hedges lias outlined that he asked me to suggest as a possibility in Nebraska. We have different types of farming areas that are in no way com - parable with yours. I mean in no way comparable for these reasons. In most areas, wheat is the dominating crop. In others, something else. It matters not whether it is wheat or cattle or hogs, the problem ir. very much the same. The problem as we see it in North Dakota is not so much what Mr. Hedges or what we find out at the college at Kargo, as what the individual farmers in these various areas find out about the con - ditions under which they are operating. That is, what are the factors that determine the size of the farm, what are the factors that determ - ine the type of farming for you as individual farmers? I was think - ing about this question as Mr. Hedges was talking. I would like to ask one or two questions. In this southeast general farming area how many of you have increased your wheat acreage on your farm In the last five years? Just two. How many of you have decreased your wheat acreage? A great many of you. If I were .to ask you individually why you decreased your wheat acreage on your farm during the past five years I would venture to say- that I would get several reasons. Perhaps many of you would refer to the prices and say they had not been satisfactory. Price is not the sole factor in decreasing or increasing, but it influences whether or not you decrease or Increase, if you are from year to year shifting your combination of farm production. At least we find it true in North Dakota and this speech indicates that you are doing it in this section. You are shifting from this to that gradually, slowly. When these shifts are made by a great mass of people to - gether, some will go faster than others, some hang back, but gen- </seg>
            <seg id="p124">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE HOARD OK AGRICULTURE erally speaking we will find that the farmers will move in pretty much the same direction. I have no doubt Professor Hedges will tell you that on two adjoining farms the owners are doing just the opposite things. How about it, Mr. Hedges? Fanning Trends and Tendencies Mr. Hedges has very nicely indicated to you what you are doing in the different areas. He informed me that in the southeastern area, something like ten or twelve per cent of the farm land is used Tor the production of wheat, corn 30 to 35 per cent. How did you get that? How did you start out? When you started twenty years ago did you have as much corn then as you do now? If you have more corn than you did 20 years ago, what are the factors which determined the increase? Our farmers think this quite important because we must de - termine the future by what has happened in the past. That is what we should study the past for. We study what has happened in past years in order that we may make some kind of a prediction of what will happen next year or the year after. So we study production of hogs. Three years ago they went up to a peak, and then went down in quantity, and then in three or four years will go up again. It goes in a regular cycle and when production goes up, prices go down. When prices go up farmers want to go into the business and when prices go down they want to get out. These shifts go on con - stantly. All of thees factors have a bearing on what we are going to do next year. Now It isn't so important so far as last year is concerned what we did last year, unless that gives us some insight into next year. So I speak about these trends, these shifts, that take place in our rarms in these respective areas. It isn't so important that Mr. Hedges or some of us in Nebraska find out what these facts are; that isn't of any use unless you were individually helped on these farms - can get an understanding of what these facts mean. That is the particular problem that I am going to take a few minutes to discuss with you here. , Value of Definite Itccords Going a step further. In Mr. Hedges' office this morning I didn't say anything to him about it but I looked around on the shelves and on the desks, and various places and I saw a record book lying there, over there another financial form. I didn't look at the names, 1 wasn't interested in names, r saw a girl over at the desk working with a great mass of figures, a lot of the facts and figures about the farms in these different sections. Some of you no doubt co - operate in keeping records to assist you, or you work thru your county agents and you study your farm business for the past year, for the year before, for as many years as you have that record.

You have your own business, and you consider your records in the light of your own business and you know' very little about your neighbor who lives across the road or a. mile down the road. You know nothing of the business records he keeps. Those people over in the rural economics department bring together your records and your neighbor's records to form a group representing the farming practices in one particular area; bring together another type of rec - ords to find out the combination of crops and livestock in another type of area. Out of that mass of material they are able to formulate something about the probability of the combination of crops and live - stock in this area. They find that there are variations from farm to farm and how each farmer runs his farm. Perhaps he has a little more corn and he has a few less hogs than his neighbor has, while his neighbor has a little less corn and more hogs. Which of these combinations is better, more corn and less hogs, or more hogs and less corn? Which are likely to be the most profitable in the next few years? Down in your neighborhood, do you know for your own farm whether it would be more profitable for you to cut out some of the wheat and raise more corn and hogs, or do you know if the reverse is true? I would venture you will say, "No, I don't know." In that the college people are no smarter than you, — they have no hunch that we ought to increase or decrease the combination. So then from the records and a vast amount of other material that is • ' " ■ ■ ■'■ : j. ■' ' I ' dfc 4fc - Accurate (arm records and price outlooks are a guide in determining what crops to increase or decrease. </seg>

Now from the resulting records you are able to work out whether the com - bination you use is likely to be a little better or poorer in the next Tew years than in the past. This is nothing more than ordinary farm budgeting or farm accounting. That can be done and is being done right here in Nebraska. Perhaps you are working on this plan. Whether you are or not, it is possible for you with that information to help yourself and your economic conditions here. The college is just the agency thru which you work, they' are the handle to the pump to bring you the facts which you need so that if you will, you can utilize that sort of information. Mr. Hedges brought out the advantage of producing one crop — wheat for example — in one area to a greater extent than in another area, and the advantage of this crop over other crops, also the ad - vantage of this crop here in Nebraska compared to some other state or some other country. That is, the relation as reflected in the price you receive for it compared to the cost of getting it on the market. In other words, what is the chance that wheat can compete success - fully with another crop here at home and also what is the chance of this crop competing with the same crop in Argentina or Russia, or some other country? You will know that you are in competition with farmers in; your own neighborhood. You are in competition with South Dakota farmers who produce hard spring wheat, and with other nations which raise wheat. If you are to successfully raise wheat, you recognize you must compete with those other producers. Do you know what the facts are surrounding this production? That gives you another whole set of factors relating to the farm business that comes outside of the farm itself. Hlze of Business How large a farm do you operate? Three hundred sixty acres? Are you wanting to increase right now — would you like to add a few more acres if you could buy from your neighbor, or rent a quarter? Would you like to do it, or would you like to get rid of that quarter •over there — rent out or sell it— and farm a smaller area? I will venture if I were to ask you that .question in that way I would get the first answer. Why will you want to increase or decrease the size of your farm? Do you think you are farming too much land? Do you want to do intensive- farming and do more business on less area? Or if you are out in the plains area, do you want to spread yourself and use big machines, tractors and combines and what not?

There in no use to discuss tlii.s question of price of the things we sell, compared to the things we buy. Our farmers in North Dakota have taken the records kept by farmers in North Dakota and are using the information as suggested. They are reducing their cost per bushel of wheat, their cost of but - terfat. They are doing It by increasing efficiency of operation largely, but also by a shift in tin* organization of their farms so that they get a better combination to use their own labor and that of horses, and get more out of them for the same investment. Those are the factors that have, an economic effect. What are you going to do with the information we have, published or unpublished? You can Ket after these facts after you have the picture in your mind. The Surplus Factor There is another great set of factors. Let us suppose that you are interested in the production of wheat. More than 50 per cent of the income of our farmers in North Dakota is derived from the wheat crop and since practically all of you raise some wheat you at least know what I am talking about. You might say the same thing about hogs or corn. What of the trend of production of wheat in the world? Is wheat production increasing or is it decreasing In re - lation to the population of the world that consumes wheat? Is there enough wheat being raised? If there is enough wheat being raised then the price that we are receiving at the present time must be high enough to bring out all the wheat needed all over the world. The price must be high enough to cause someone to produce wheat. What about next year and the year after? Is population increasing? The population of the United States is increasing. The population of other countries is increasing. There is a marked tendency for that rate of Increase to become smaller. In other words, the proportion of births to deaths in many countries is becoming more nearly equalized. Why talk about such a thing as -this? In certain of the European countries are the people who will consume the surplus wheat. There will be surplus wheat in the United States. Then as a long time proposition in the future, even for our lifetime, isn't it worth while for us to know what is the probability In regard to the trend for the demand of wheat, and then if there is a" tendency for an increase in wheat consumption, where is the wheat going to come from? What are the things that determine the prices? What determines the prices of hogs, wheat, or any other commodity? You come to market and say, "why doesn't the buyer say $1.00 per bushel for wheat, why doesn't he say 90 cents or $1.10?" The demand for it regulates the price and that is where the general price level is more or less determined. The elevator man has just as much to do about fixing the price as you do. In fact, he has less to do. He gets his orders from </seg>

Everybody is going to buy wheat Just as cheap as they can whether they are in Chicago or whether they are In Omaha or Liverpool. They know how badly they want the wheat, and how high to bid up on the market. There is a lot of information available on the subject of eggs and the trend of prices of eggs. What makes the price of eggs high at one season of the year and low at another? They are so given that most of you can figure when the price of eggs is going to be cheap, is when you will have lots to sell. You know there are sea - sonal trends of - hog prices. What are the factors that determine them? . . Every farmer will make a study of pricey in respect to his own business. Back of this there is the question, how are you going to meet the situation? How much are you going to go into cooperat - ives? Are you going to buy direct, are you going to hedge, do this or that, or other methods of marketing? In North Dakota there are as many groups of men as there are different ways or possibilities that it can be done. There is no uniformity of opinion of whether it is better to sell hogs direct or join an association and ship to the terminal market or consign to a commission merchant. There are a» many different opinions as there are ways in which it is possible' to do it. There must be a best way, there must be some way that in I etter than the others. I am not smart enough to know what the renditions are under which this way will be better than that way, but you who are interested are smart enough to taice all these facts, und flrrure out your own way. This involves a study of conditions. What about the placing of packer buyers over the state? Is it a good thing for a farmer to have a packing plant in his dooryard? Some say yes, some say no. Is it best to sell your livestock direct to them to get today's price and deliver them by truck today so you will know what you are going to receive or is it better for some of you to join together and ship to a terminal? That question can't be answered definitely. I know that people have given an answer, but I don't know of any one who has studied these facts to learn the economic way of doing. How are you going to absorb and get into your system all this great mass of facts and information? We have been trying for the past two or three years in North Dakota to make it possible for a large number of farmers to get these facts, to coordinate them with their own experiences and their own knowledge and in groups de - termine what is the wise thing- to do. You as an individual might make up your mind after considering a whole lot of facts that a certain thing is the thing, to do, and discuss it with a neighbor. He might have a different conclusion than yours. After that you two consider the facts in the light of more conditions, with more light </seg>
            <seg id="p129">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION than you as an individual could do, and come to the conclusion as to what is the best method for both. Our Dakota Plan So. we have hit upon this scheme. I throw it out here for your consideration. We go out into a county or into one of the farming areas. We go to the county agent, we go to the banker, or anyone else who knows people who live in that area. We say to them, "We would like to have the names of 150 to 300 outstanding thinking farmers." We don't want lumbermen, bankers, business men. ! We want farmers. We send out a letter to these farmers and we say that in a certain town, for two days, we are going to have a session where we are going to consider various facts relating to exports and imports, tariff, marketing, seed certification, cultivation, all of those factors which enter into your life. We are going to come together; we are going to consider these things in relation to a united program. What are we going to do in the future, and how are we going to do it? We have a group of men out of that 150 to 300 who are going to .sit as a committee and who are just going to consider all; the facts in relation to wheat, another group to consider rye, another flax — varieties, trends, Increase or decrease In exports or imports. They ure going to consider all angles of those industries. We have a farmer as chairman of each committee. Here is another group going to consider hogs — production, consumption, marketing, all facts re - lating to hogs that can possibly be brought together. The material can be put up in graphic form so that In a very few minutes you can KniHp the situation, and reach a conclusion. So you consider hogs; you consider ' every other kind of farm product — dairy, livestock, and poultry. You meet together first as a general committee. Mr. Hedges or some one who has a general picture of this problem will take some of these general reports and tell what the trend of prices has been, what exports have been, so you will get an idea of the situation. ' After noon you break up into committees. There will be somebody like Mr. Hedges or Mr. Cole who will sit with you In each of these little committees with a little pamphlet. All that this fellow who meets with you will do is ex - plain what these charts mean. He hasn't given you one suggestion or conclusion. He has pointed out that the facts are thus and so, and interprets those facts. You formulate your own conclusions as to whether wheat or corn or hogs are best; what in your judgment is the wise program to set for the county; the wise thing to do as farmers In this state. You sit there that afternoon and you get to - gether that night. Generally you have had enough sitting after (our or five hours and want to get some fresh air. Statewide Recommendations Out of this mass of material, I don't care how smart you are or how ignorant you are, if you are of a mind to give it a little thought, </seg>
            <seg id="p130">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OK AGRICULTURE it you will consider the problems, you will get something that will be of value to you. Next morning you come together again to finish up where you left off.. You make a set of recommendations about wheat or hogs which will form what may be considered a program for the area. While you have been sitting as a committee on wheat or hogs, there is still another committee that has the worst job of any, because the job of that commitee is to keep up with the other groups and fit together their plans into some sort of a systematic program. The livestock committee says to increase feeding and get more hogs to the market. We must raise more wheat, the crops committee might say. Working independently they might do that. As fast as a recommendation is made in each committee, it is taken over to the farm management committee and formulated Into a system of farming. The secretary of that committee will take these combina - tions that you suggest for wheat and hogs, and corn and all the rest — will put them together and figure what income may be expected. He will put them into the form of a farm budget. If the farm is a half section, he will work out what it is likely to cost to produce so much wheat. He can do that because of the cost records he has Further these will furnish a basis for his conclusions. Finally, the committee will suggest better methods than now in use. We have tried several of these programs in North Dakota, tried them in 12 individual counties in one group and five individ - ual counties in another group and I am going to tell you what has been the result. In every case after the recommendations of the wheat committee and the hog committee and all the rest have been brought together and coordinated, in every single case the net re - sult has been a more profitable type of farming in that area. On the afternoon of the second day after all the committee reports have been brought in and read, recommending thus and so, we of the farm management committee, as a result of our study, recommend a cer - tain combination as a basis for the study of any farmer who is farm - ing in that area. It is worth his consideration as a basis of study so that he may pick out certain facts to help him with his business No one farmer can adopt them all, at least not at once. Coordination of thinking of all the farmers in the section is necessary. The recommendations are published and distributed to every one who cares to have them. That report then forms the basis for the agricultural program for the county extension agent, ror the college, for the crop development association, or the breeders association, for the development agents or railroads, every sort of agency that is interested or thinks they are Interested in promoting some agricultural scheme. It becomes the well thot out program of the best farmers in that region. There are some things that are blanket recommendations, that every thinking farmer knows about— for example, the McLean sys- </seg>
            <seg id="p131">NEBRASKA CUOP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION tern of hog lot sanitation'. When it comes to a question of how many hogs to fit into a good farming combination we can't make the same recommendation everywhere. So you can come down to the county basis and bring the county together in the same way to work out recommendations. This program is an expensive kind of luxury when it takes from the college 10 or 20 men who specialize in these lines, to help you in your community, but while it is expensive it means that it consolidates the best ideas and the best things that have yet l&gt;een found in our state into something constructive and usable. County Conferences Now we have gone thus far in the program in North Dakota. We have held county conferences in some 17 counties and on the basis of these conferences we have organized in those counties what is known as county extension committees. The county extension com - mittee consists of the farmer chairman of each of the commodity committees — hogs, dairy, cash crops, and so on — and of the farm inanagement committee, thus making up a committee of men who have come from all parts of the county. That county extension com - mittee formulates out of the program that has been set up, the best things they think ought to be done in the county. That committee formulates the specific projects that the extension service and the college is going to take up and follow as a line of activity of benefit to those who are farming in that county. You will say that I haven't said a word about one phase of this thing — the women's angle. They told us in North Dakota when we started this thing, that they were going to try and bring the women along to the meeting. We said to our women in the home demonstra - tion department "what can you do to amuse the women?" Those women said they had a program of their own. They didn't have a great amount of information and a lot of basic facts as the men had. but they did have a little common sense. The women were divided into three groups. There was a group on clothing. If women out in the county were particularly good at making clothes, they were chosen to attend and form one group. Another group of women who were particularly competent in connection with foods came together, nnd another group made up of women who are particularly good at home management, in arranging of pictures in the home, in the com - fort, convenience and ease of maintaining the home made up still another, committee. They said, "If we can't find any information about good ways of doing things, we will take the women, go over it with them and we will pick out of those ways suggested the best way that they have found desirable and put those into the women's end ot the program." It worked. The women got as much or more out of this conference than the men. The results of their meeting were published in connection [ with the men's report. The county published the report and distributed it </seg>

Discussion by E. B. liewis Nebr. Agricultural College I do not get the point in having engineers discuss such complete talks as those just given by the economists. They keep us so busy trying to keep equipment efficient and designing the right type of equipment to carry out the program the economists promote that we can't keep up. We are distinctly busy trying to perfect more equip - ment. During December I attended a meeting of the American Society of Agricultural Engineers in Chicago. One speaker told of exper - iences In industrialized wheat raising. John S. Bird farms 40,000 acres of Kansas land mostly in wheat and does this with tractor and tractor equipment. This shows some of our activities at least. This man was followed by Hickam Price who is trying to farm about the same acreage in Texas. His main talk brought out that they were trying to use the equipment that is mapped out by the ~T~ 7 1 - jk . - ■ .- The development and use of power- farming equipment is an important factor in determining the trends of Nebraska's agriculture. economists as being needed and use it 24 hours a day. They are using tractors and men on an 8 hour schedule; trying out indus - trialized farming. On the power engineering program in Chicago talks were given on general purpose tractor and cultivator equipment for the general purpose tractor. These were by men who have a wide field of exper - ience. It keeps the engineers busy in the research field keeping up with the economic program outlined by these rural economics men. </seg>
            <seg id="p133">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS 1 ASSOCIATION Further In this program we had designing or hay machinery for general purpose tractor. Where the economists have outlined ithat hay production should increase we have had to take care of a 1 lot of new machinery to follow out their program. Another place we have had to take up these research or inves - tigation problems is in the farm transportation problem. These econ - omists outline that we raise more wheat. It is up to some one else to take up the problem of raising and transporting wheat. This was also a phase of the program at Chicago. The relation of farm machinery to man, and of farm machinery and weed control were emphasized. The last speaker, Mr. Willard, brought out something about Rus - sia. During these talks at Chicago we had two men tell us about conditions in Russia which led us to think that these economists may have to have an understudy for each crop they advocate that you raise. The Russian Problem Prof. J. B. Davidson who was in the same party with Mr. M. L. Wilson in Russia, and Mr. Fletcher, former professor of agricultural engineering, in University of California brought us some vital infor - mation about Russian conditions. They brought out another idea that probably farming over there is getting on such a large scale that there will be a loss of the Individual, and the possibility that this lame loss may come in the United States. But I will steer clear of any phases of rural economics. I passed the course in school but otherwise know nothing of it. Mass Production in Agriculture Mr. Willard spoke of there not being any standard of business in farming. Apparently that is being overcome. In this phase, Mr. llird in. his first talk' mentioned this problem. He showed how they follow the experiences other farmers have given them, what his com - pany charge to depreciation — and that the vast spread in their acre - age lessened the damage from local weather conditions in such a way as to take care of hail insurance. They have figured this out on a very large scale apparently, and are giving themselves a 10 year basis to work on. They have figured just what is to be the cost of wheat. I talked to Mr. Fletcher, who is a representative of a large manufacturing firm, and recently sent to Russia in the interests of this firm. I asked him how men like Price and Bird felt towards him and his firm and the possibility that some of their calculations might be upset by companies trying to sell Russia tools that would allow her to compete with us In production. They are selling large com - bines, large tractors so that Russia, by having one man manage a lot of these peasants or laborers, can produce enough by the use of this large machinery to compete with the United States. </seg>
            <seg id="p134">i REPORT OK NEBRASKA STATE HOARD OF AGRICULTURE You remember when Russia is peaceful they have been able to export as much wheat as America raises and there is a problem. Mr. ■ Fletcher had much to say as to whether hia people are real Amer - icans in helping this production. Mr. Price and men of his type were figuring very close. Mr. Price down in Texas by using their equip - ment and their labor 24 hours a day can produce wheat at 40 cents. They gave facts and figures so furiously it was hard to get them all. They talked about the understudy of crops. I have had in mind mostly wheat. If you have been near this college recently you have noticed that we have had several delegations of Russians who have taken Mr. Kiesselbach around and around on wheat production. They have grabbed up our tractor tests, combine tests, and everything 1'ertainlng to wheat raising here at the Nebraska station — have taken train loads and even ship loads of machinery across to Russia to f-uch an extent that possibly ' there is a place for us to discuss this in our talks on the economic phases when we get up as agricultural engineers. I had a few points possibly that might be all. right to bring up here to show that there really is a lot of work being done liy the engineers and possibly that is the reason they jumped on us 10 defend ourselves, rather than discuss the other topic. We have fellows who make a lot of criticism on the machinery that is out. Prof. Nixon of Pennsylvania puts in most of his time on potato crops. He said that' the manufacturers were all- robbers and the farmers were all so dumb you could sell them anything. He was talking about potato machinery. He said that farmers bought machinery they couldn't use, that wasn't efficient or practical, — mak - ing a particular point that farmers were dumb and that manufactur - ers were crooked in putting the machinery across. Men are selling equipment in this state — not potato tools so much but other tools we can't do what we want to with. This Is not altogether our fault, larmers are not putting the study on machinery that they should. I believe there is a place for the equipment phase in a discussion of economics. . . '■■ . . DiHciiHslon by Iieroy Ithmles Polk County The thing that I want to mention is the fact that I was trained as an engineer and I am trying to farm instead of being interested only in farm equipment.. I have to be interested in every phase that touches me as a farmer. I use equipment and try to use the best there is. Some, of the things haven't worked out to the best advantage and other things have proven successful. There is a difference between advocating the use of a farm machine as a seller and advocating it from the standpoint of a man who has to get out and make his living with it. </seg>

Anyway I took over equipment that looked to me like it wasn't just what it should have been — 2 bottom gang plow — six - horses, harrow, seven foot binder — 6 or 7 foot drill. My wife had an ordinary cast iron range in the kitchen: the house otherwise pretty fairly modern. Today we are using 3 bottom tractor-plow, we use a combine, a 24 foot disk, and in the kitchen we have a Skelgas range. That just gives us an idea of the things we thought necessary to have to keep up with the times. We think that all those things are making us money. I am sorry I haven't time to give you records of pome of those things, but I am not prepared. SWEET CliOVEU MANAGEMENT D. 1j. GROSS, Extension Agronomist It would be quite out of the ordinary if a discussion of sweet clover did not appear on our program. In recent years there has been perhaps no more animated discussions than those which j have had to do with some phase of growing of sweet clover. No other crop has had such a remarkable history. It has been very appro - priately called the Cinderella of our Farm Crops. Only a compara - tively few years ago sweet clover was quite generally despised as a veed, while today particularly in the corn belt states it is quite; gen - erally regarded as one of the greatest boons that has come to iargi - culture. So rapid has been the spread in the use of sweet clover for soil improvement, that in some sections of the corn belt its acreage is greater than the combined acreage of all other legume crops. The agriculture of certain areas has been literally transformed by the introduction of this crop. There is probably no doubt but that the systematic rotation of crops and the resultant increase in soil fer - tility and yields, has come about many years sooner than would be the case had we not possessed this truly invaluable plant. "It is not this aspect of the crop that I have been asked to dis - cuss, however. My subject deals rather with but one of the many phases of sweet clover management, which has brought up many ques - tions, and which at the same time is quite important in its bearing on soil fertility and crop yields. I refer to the life history of sweet clover with particular reference to the amount of fertility added to the soil at the different stages of its development. </seg>
            <seg id="p136">UEP011T OK NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Plowing Up Sweet Clover The question has been raised as to the time at -which the plow - ing under of the sweet clover, is most feasable. Obviously, to let the sweet clover make its full two years' growth, the greatest amount of benefit is accrued to the soil; when one considers not only the actual nitrogen added, but also the reserve of organic matter which is built up and which hot only serves as a source of nitrogen for the years to follow, but which also greatly improves the tilth and struc - ture of the soil. . i '- : ■ . Plowing sweet clover under In the nprinu of its second year is a good practice on reasonably fertile .fields in eastern Nebraska. Where one has a soil that is badly depleted of organic matter, and is of such a texture that it tends to puddle when wet and to bake and crack when dry, there is probably no question but that in the majority of instances it would be wise, should a good stand of sweet clover be secured, to leave it stand for the full two years, and the entire crop then plowed under and incorporated with the soil. There is perhaps no other method that would so Improve such soils, in so Fhort a time. There is another class of soils, however, that In the most recent years demands somewhat different tactics, if we are to handle them in the most profitable manner. The practice of rotating . crops with sweet clover, red clover, and alfalfa has made such rapid strides par - ticularly In eastern Nebraska that we now have, together with unde - pleted virgin soils, many thousands of acres that at the present time are relatively high in fertility, and which the alert farmer desires to keep in a state of maximum productivity. Such soils do not re - f.uire large additions of nitrogen and organic matter. A lesser amount, added regularly, particularly under our conditions of limited rain- </seg>
            <seg id="p137">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION fall will prove the more profitable practice. For these soils, and where sweet clover Is used In the rotation, the proper time to plow under the sweet clover becomes an important question. - Fall Pasturing or Mowing Recent experiments conducted at the Ohio Experiment Station have proven what many field observations and farm experiences have indicated that sweet clover if planted early in the spring, and allowed tc make its full growth the first season, without mowing or pastur - ing, will will contain the maximum amount of nitrogen in Us roots and stems, on about May 15 to June 1st of its second year. During the last week of April or the first week of May the plants normally con - tain 75 to 80 per cent of this maximum. Since most of the sweet clover land is ordinarily planted to corn and since the optimum plant- Ing date for eastern Nebraska is somewhere near the middle of May In normal seasons, and since early plowing for corn is recognized as good practice, it is evident that plowing the sweet clover under be - fore the maximum nitrogen content is attained, Is the wise practice to follow. It is all the more wise where one considers that in Ne - braska, the overstlnmlation of a corn crop early in the season often results disastrously should prolonged drouths, or hot winds occur in July or August. Late plowing of sweet clover in the spring may not only add excess nitrogen, but the extra growth of the Bweet clover removes the moisture reserves from the soil which Is needed for the corn, and at the same time makes it difficult if not impossible to pre - pare a satisfactory seedbed. The dry soil turns up lumpy, and the excess growth of sweet clover which, is turned under forms a layer which facilitates the drying out of the top soil and prevents its con - tact with the subsoil. Nitrogen in Sweet Clover There is another phase of this subject which I believe merits careful consideration. I have discussed the time at which in the growth of sweet clover the greatest amount of nitrogen is contained within the plant. It must be remembered, however, that this applies only to sweet clover which has been allowed to make its full growth during its first year, without being cut for hay or pastured at least until after hard killing frosts. The Ohio experiments show very strik - ingly the fact that mowing Bweet clover early in the fall of its first years growth, greatly retards root development and as a consequence postpones to a much later date the time of maximum nitrogen ac - cumulation the following year. Figure one shows that the sweet clover not cut for hay the previous season, reached a maximum nitro - gen content of nearly 200 lbs. per acre on May 15, while that which was mowed the previous fall, not only did not reach its maximum until July 1st, but attained a total of less than 140 lbs. </seg>
            <seg id="p138">KErOIlT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE To say, however, that one should never mow sweet clover for hay in the fall of Its first year would be overstating the case. The hoil upon which the sweet clover is growing may not need but a slight addition of nitrogen to bring It to the state where moisture rather than nitrogen is the limiting factor in the yield of the subse - quent grain crop. The value of the hay crop must also be taken Into consideration. *°°l — I — I — | ksa^-tegf I I • 1 — I — I — I — I — I — i 100 — ___rr__5S^ v s _____. &lt; U ,J g__ -2-= § j&amp;C?'* "Total AJ\-njoGEAl"p_qAci2C -K »„ — __*!

It is becoming a quite common practice among the most suc - cessful farmers to seed a legume of some kind with every acre of spring sown small grain. In case the legume is sweet clover it is often pastured or cut for hay in the fall of the year. The land is plowed the next spring about May first and planted to corn, to be followed again either by corn, or another small grain and legume crop. Where one starts out with a soil well up in fertility a short system of rotation such as this will no doubt keep the soil in a high state of productivity. Soils low In fertility, however, will need to he handled differently and leaving the sweet clover unmolested for the first year will pay good dividends. The following table showing the growth of sweet clover in Nebraska tells its own story. </seg>

MR. GROSS: Under those conditions the late plowing might be advisable. There would be plenty of water to take care of the extra fertility. MR. GRIJVER, Lancaster County: What is a good seed bed? MR. GROSS: For surface planted corn the ground should be plowed and then repacked. It is very important to work out the air spaces. MR. CLAPP, Cass County: Where one has a very heavy growth of dead sweet clover stems would it be better to plow this under or burn it off? MR. GROSS: This growth should be save.l if possible because it contains considerable nitrogen and will add a lot of organic mat - ter to the soil. Breaking this growth down and then disking both lengthwise and crosswise, would probably break the stems enough so that a go6d seedbed could be prepared. If one simply plows this growth under without breaking it up in some way, it is likely that a poor seedbed will be the result. It might possibly be better to burn it if one cannot get it well broken. up. QUESTION: I read- some place that where one plows under too much material that it ties up the nitrates in the soil and may reduce the yields. ■ '■'■'• •'■ ' MR. GROSS: That article, no doubt, referred to the plowing under of straw. Straw contains very little nitrogen, and when it decays it seems to tie up the nitrogen already present in the soil, in such a way that plants cannot use it.. This would not be true, jhow - ever, of sweet clover straw because it contains considerable nitrogen. It acts more like manure. MR. YOUNGS: Under irrigation where one can apply as much water as necessary, is there much danger in plowing under a heavy growth of sweet clover? </seg>
            <seg id="p140">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE MR. GROSS: Under those conditions one could, no doubt, plow under a heavy growth without any danger. The extra moisture would help to decay the sweet clover and the matter of seedbed would not be so important. QUESTION: What is the best rotation with sweet clover, and when should it be plowed? MR. GROSS: One of the most common rotations is sweet clover and oats, corn two years and sweet clover and oats again. Barley, of course, can be substituted for oats. In this sort of a rotation the sweet clover is plowed up in late April or early May of its second year. This makes a short rotation and where one does not need the sweet clover for pasture, it is a very practical one. A practice which is being used quite generally is to plow the sweet clover shallow and men list the ground to corn. Listed corn is less likely to burn dur - ing dry weather, because it grows slower during the early part of the season, and makes a less leafy plant, thereby requiring less mois - ture to produce the same amount of corn. QUESTION: Would it pay to leave sweet clover grow two full years and pasture it the second year? MR. GROSS: Where one can use the pasture it should pay, es - pecially on land that is badly run down, and needs building up in nitrogen and organic matter. Where one has been practicing a ro - tation for some time and has his soil pretty well built up, leaving the sweet clover two years is not necessary. Except in the eastern coun - ties of the state, one must be careful and not let the nitrogen content of his soil get too high as there is quite a little danger in that case of the following crop making an extra large early growth, only to have it burn later during hot dry periods. MR. CLAUSSEN, Gage County: Is It practical to sow sweet clover in corn after the last cultivation? MR. GROSS: This is usually not a successful practice, although occasionally some fellows get a pretty good stand. One of the draw - backs is that if the clover does get a good start It takes ' moisture from the corn and reduces the yield. The chances are better to seed the sweet clover with oats or barley. </seg>

There is a time when every soil contains the proper amount of moisture to plow in the best tilth. If plowed in a wetter or drier condition the results accomplished will be less satisfactory. It Is unnecessary for me to further emphasize the fact that the first object of cultivation is to put the soil into good physical condition.

It is Important also to incorporate organic matter with the soil so that It will decay prop - erly and in decaying release from itself and other soil material plant food for growing crops. If It is ever advisable to plow deep, that is, deeper than six inches, it is probably for the purpose of incorpor - ating organic matter with a greater volume of the mineral soil and in that way build a larger store house in which reserve supplies of plant food can be stored. In England for many centuries it has been a common practice to trench the land, that is, to dig u*p the subsoil and work organic matter into it. "In market gardening and horti - culture it is common to trench the land with the object of making the subsoil more like the surface soil. Sixty years ago it was thought that the subsoil was really the virgin soil, rich in stores of food that only needed liberating by the action of frost. Sixty years .of experi - mental work have shown that this is not correct; the subsoil is really very poor in plant nutrients and nothing whatever is gained by bring - ing it to the surface. Considered as a manure it is despicably poor." * * * "Experiments at the Wbburn Fruit Farm and at Rothamsted have shown that loosening the subsoil without adding manure has very little effect either on the water content, the amount of plant food or the growth of trees. There is no evidence that this operation is worth doing; the gardner who takes the trouble to trench should certainly not miss the excellent opportunity it affords for putting the very necessary manure into the lower spit." Perhaps with an un - limited supply of organic matter at our command there would be no reasonable limit to the depth that it would be advisable to plow. But under practical Nebraska farm conditions it is extremely doubtful if deep plowing ever pays even in crop returns to say nothing about cost of plowing and there is not a person who does not fully appreciate (he added cost of turning each additional inch of subsoil with the plow. If it is ever advisable to increase the depth of plowing it should be done gradually. After the desired depth has been obtained it will probably not be necessary to plow to the full .depth each sea - son. The frequency with which it is desirable to turn the soil to its maximum depth will probably depend upon climatic and soil con - ditions. Any improvement brought about by working in organic matter to greater depths is bound to be slow. These results, while probably more lasting in their elTect, are not usually pronounced in any par - ticular crop. In other words, the change is gradual and slow. The Quick response of plants to proper cultivation is undoubtedly due to other causes. We usually say that it is due to the effect that culti - vation has in conserving moisture and liberating plant food. How important is cultivation in this respect? We have all often observed how quickly. plants respond to proper cultivation. Success or failure in securing a stand of alfalfa depends very much on the way the seed - bed is prepared. Timely cultivation of corn is also important, but </seg>

Tillage in Wheat Production To illustrate this point I wish to present, some data that we have obtained at the Kansas Agricultural Experiment Station where ground has been prepared at different times for wheat. The '&lt; land upon which the work was conducted is very uniform in character and every precaution was taken to prevent anything from influencing the growth of wheat other than the way the seedbed was prepared. A comparison was made of a number of different methods of preparing ground for wheat but I wish to call your attention at this time to only four of them, namely, disking immediately before seeding, and plowing in September, in August, and in July. The disked ground was harrowed befpre seeding and the. plowed ground was worked after plowing sufficiently to prevent the growth of weeds and to put the soil into good mechanical condition at seeding. The wheat was sown the first week in October. The results have been as follows: The Effect Upon Yield of Different Ways of Preparing Ground for Wheat Wheat Crown Continuously Method of Preparation Av.

T ~ j Wheat web grown upon this land continuously since 1911 and the same plot of ground was used year after year for the same treat - ment. In 1911, the first season, the highest yield of wheat, over 38 bushels to the acre, was obtained from ground plowed in July and the yield dropped about 10 bushels an acre for each month that plow - ing was delayed. Less than four bushels of wheat was grown to the acre on the ground that was not plowed but which was disked jUBt before seeding. This ground was thoroughly disked, the mechanical condition of the soil was as good as could be desired but the ground lacked something necessary for the production of wheat. While there has been a marked decrease in the yield of all plats during the 10-year period, the early plowed ground continues to produce; the most wheat and has done so as an average of the 10-year period. The only exception has been the crop of 1914 which followed the extremely dry summer of 1913. .Between July 1 and September 15 there was only slightly more than an inch of rainfall. This was the </seg>
            <seg id="p144">REPORT OK NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OK AGRICULTURE driest year in the history of the state. The rain came in a number of small showers. The ground was so dry and the weather so hot that the water quickly evaporated and weeds did not grow. Please remember this fact. I will refer to it again later. To be sure just how far we can safely go in reducing plowing and other tillage costs we must have more definite Information about the why as well as the how of the work. Why does July or August plowing result In higher yields of wheat than September plowing? . - ■ ■ TUIajre to prevent weed growth has been shown to be the most important factor in preparing a winter wheat seedbed. That was the next thing that interested us. Our farmer friends who were advocates of early plowing said it was because we had conserved moisture. We thought perhaps plant food might have something to do with it also. So we started making determinations of the amount of moisture and nitrates in the ground at seeding time where the ground had been prepared in different ways. This is what we found.

            <seg id="p145">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION There was no definite relation between the supply of moisture in the surface six feet of soil at seeding time and the yield of wheat the next year. As an average of the 10-year period there has been slightly more moisture at seeding time in the ground that was not worked until Just before seeding and which produced the lowest yield. This was due to the inability of the wheat plants on this plat to use the moisture in the soil, consequently this land was never depleted of its supply of moisture. The early plowed plats which grew heavy crops of wheat used the moisture that was available and consequently left the soil depleted of available moisture at harvest. It would not be correct to conclude that moisture had not been conserved by early plowing for moisture determinations made through the summer show that there was usually a marked increase in moisture in the upper three feet of soil on these plats during this period. But the increase between the time of plowing and seeding was scarcely sufficient to overcome the difference in moisture at harvest time. While there is an abundance of data to show that early plowing has conserved mols - ture, I believe you must agree with me that there is no indication that moisture has been* the direct cause for the difference in yield of wheat on these plats. Nitrates and Cultivation Let us now examine the data pertaining to available nitrogen or nitrates. The amount of nitrates in the soil is perhaps our best mea - sures of the supply of available plant food. These data show that the nitrates in the surface three feet of soil at seeding time are the highest for the early plowed plats and lowest for those worked late. There is also a very close correlation between the amount of avail - able nitrogen at seeding and the yield of wheat. Plant food has ac - cumulated in the early plowed ground. With a supply of available plant food high yields have been secured. When a smaller quantity of plant food was available, as in the late plowed ground, the plants did not grow as satisfactorily and smaller yields resulted. When there was an ample supply of available plant food moisture was used and the ground was usually dry at harvest. On the other hand, when available plant food was deficient the crop was unable to use the moisture present. Consequently there was usually a surplus of moisture in the late plowed and disked plats at harvest time. The why in this case appears obvious. Available plant food and not mois - ture has been the important factor which has determined the yield of wheat. If moisture has been a limiting factor its effect has been indirect rather than direct. Cultivation and Weeds But there is yet another why in this case. If ground is plowed and cultivated why is moisture conserved and why does plant i food accumulate? Is it because cultivation prevents the loss of water due </seg>
            <seg id="p146">JIEPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE to a soil mulch that is created or because weeds are killed and the moisture not used? Why do nitrates accumulate? Is It because cul - tivation Increases nitrification or because vegetation Is destroyed and the nitrates which are liberated are allowed to accumulate in the soil? To answer these questions a series of plats were started which were treated in different ways during the summer months. AH were diked up so that rain which fell would remain on the plats and enter the soil. Two plats were kept cultivated three inches deep during the summer so that a soil mulch was maintained; two were uncultivated, but the weeds were scraped off with a hoe so that no vegetation grew upon them but the ground was not worked; and two others were left without any cultivation and the weeds were allowed to grow. The work was started on each plat early in the spring, and continued through the summer. These were the results that were obtained when moisture and nitrate determinations were made of samples of soils taken from each plat in October and averaged for six years 1914-1919. ' The Effect of Cultivation and Weeds on Retention of Mointure and Accumulation of Nitrates in the Soil Soil Treatment Per cent water.

When the weeds were not removed, however, the ground was much drier. There was an average of 4 per cent less v.ater In the surface six feet of soil on these plats. The facts are clear. Moisture is removed rapidly from the soil by weeds and other growing vegetation. Cultivation kills weeds and, therefore, conserves moisture. If the weeds can be killed without cultivating the soil as they were when they were removed by scraping, moisture will be conserved. Cultivation prevents the loss of water from the soil be - cause it kills weeds, not because a soil mulch 1b formed. If weeds were not present the loss of moisture by evaporation from the soil is very slow and cultivation is unnecessary as far as conservation of moisture is concerned. What about the formation of nitrate in the soil? These results show that there was just as large an accumulation of nitrates in the ground that was scraped as in that which was cultivated. When </seg>
            <seg id="p147">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION ' I ' .1 weeds were allowed to grow very little available nitrogen accumu - lated. The weeds used the nitrogen in their growth. If weeds are killed nitrates accumulate whether or not the ground is cultivated. Cultivation, therefore, aids in the accumulation of nitrates because it kills weeds, not because stirring the soil greatly increases their formation. Consequently the most important thing accomplished by cultivation is the killing of weeds. If weeds are kept from growing moisture will be conserved and nitrates will accumulate in the soil even though the ground is not stirred. Soil Texture Factors Will not the character of the soil greatly affect results of this character? Can we expect the same results on clay and sand as those secured on the silt loam soil used in this case? To answer this question we have the results of a single season, 1917. Additional work was prevented by the war. A number of plats were prepared l.y removing the surface foot of soil and replacing it with soil of different texture. In one case a very light sand was used, in an - other case a heavy brown clay subsoil, and in the third case the or - dinary undisturbed silt loam soil was used. Half of the plats with each type of soil were cultivated through the summer to a depth of three inches, the other half were uncultivated but weeds were removed by scraping with a hoe. We secured these results: Moisture and Nitrates in Cultivated and Bare Uncultivated Clay, Hand, and Slit Loam Soil (Average, Season, 1917) I A very A very Ordinary | heavy clay light land silt loam ' I Cultivated Bare Cultivated Bare Cultivated Bare Average per cent moisture to foot soil- 22 4 23.0 17.2 16.4 19.9 20.4 Pounds nitrates per acre 3 feet ; 74.0 57.0 91.0 126.0 219.0 220.0 The moisture determinations show that in the case of all three soils an uncultivated surface was just as effective in conserving mois - ture as a cultivated one. Somewhat different results were secured with respect to nitrate development. Comparing the cultivated with the bare, uncultivated soil we find the most rapid development of nitrates in the cultivated clay soil and in the uncultivated sand soil with no difference in the case of the silt loam. These results; are to he expected from what we know of the effect of cultivation on the moisture content of the surface three inches of soil. While extreme differences in type of soil do affect the results secured from culti- </seg>
            <seg id="p148">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE vation on liberation of nitrates, most of the farm soils of Nebraska -•' and the United States more nearly approach the silt loam used in this experiment in which cultivation did not affect nitrification. Weeds and Nitrates It appears, therefore, that in most farm soils, nitrates are lib - crated as rapidly in uncultivated as In cultivated ground. On un - cultivated ground weeds use the nitrates as they are liberated. If this is the case why should we not be able to harvest, weigh, and analyze the weeds and determine this point definitely? This we have I done. In the case of the two plats prepared for wheat, one by . plowing in July and cultivating through the summer, the other by I disking just before seeding, we have harvested and analyzed the weeds on the disked plat and compared the nitrates liberated with those liberated on the July plowed ground. The weeds have been har - vested and analyzed every season since 1915. As an average of the six years, 1915 to 1920, inclusive, the results have been as follows: Pounds per acre Nitrates at seeding in July plowed ground -303 Nitrates at seeding in ground where weeds grew 70 Weight of weeds grown , 4,879 Per cent nitrogen in weeds 0.844 Nitrates in weeds 182 Difference in nitrates in favor of cultivated land 51 Total nitrates in weeds and in soil 252 The nitrogen in the roots of the weeds was not determined. It ip safe to assume, however, that a large part of the difference in nitrates In favor of the cultivated land would be offset by the nitrates used by the roots of the weeds in their growth. It is evident that nitrates have been produced about as rapidly, if not just as rapidly, in the uncultivated as in the cultivated land. When the land was not cultivated the weeds used the nitrates in growth and it did not accumulate in the soil. In the cultivated land ..the nitrates accum - ulated in the soil and were available later for the wheat. Early plowing is beneficial, therefore, principally because weeds are de - stroyed. Is it not clear now why in 1914 following the very dry year the ground disked at seeding produced nearly as much as the early plowed ground? Weeds did not grow in the stubble, thus very little was accomplished by plowing. In the drier parts of the United States excellent crops of wheat are frequently raised without cul - tivating the ground. If weeds grow they must be killed. If they do not grow very little will be accomplished by cultivation. If there was any easier or cheaper method of destroying weeds than plowing I would recommend its use. In dry times, advantage should be taken or the opportunity to reduce tillage costs. Kill the weeds, but do not waste time and labor trying to create a soil mulch on clean lr.nd. </seg>

The most successful, method will be the one that will kill the weeds the most rapidly and at the least expense. Cultivation in Corn Production What about the cultivation of corn? Do the sune principles ap - ply.? Do we cultivate corn ground to kill weeds or to produce a soil mulch? - This is a subject that has received the attention of a number of experiment stations. At the Kansas Station we have conducted an experiment since 1914 where four different methods of cultivation of corn have been compared. - 1. Ordinary cultivation. The corn is cultivated from three to five times and laid by when it is impossible to cultivate with a two - horse cultivator. 2. Ordinary cultivation followed by a one-horse cultivator when - ever in our judgment the ground was crusted and it was necessary to cultivate to produce a soil mulch. 3. Ordinary cultivation followed by a one-horse cultivator every 10 days until the corn was mature. 4. No cultivation but the weeds removed by scraping them off at the surface of the ground with a hoe. This ground was either fall or spring plowed and well prepared before the corn was planted. The results have been as follows: Yield of Corn in Bushels per Acre with Different Methods of Cultivation A very A very Average Method of Cultivation • dry year [ wet year 7 yearu 1914 1915 1914-1921 Ordinary cultivation 13.0 60.1 47.0 Ordinary cultivation, one-horse cul - tivator as per judgment '. 13.4 57.3 46.7 Ordinary cultivation, one-horse cul - tivator every 10 days. 11.0 52.1 45.8 No cultivation, weeds scraped off 9.2 58.6 46.6 In a dry year, cultivation has shown to advantage although the difference in yield per acre is small. In a wet year more than the ordinary amount of cultivation was detrimental. As an average of seven years, there was no increase in yield of corn when the crop was cultivated as compared with the uncultivated land when the weeds were scraped off with a hoe. Cultivating every 10 days with a one-horse cultivator has decreased the yield to a small extent. Cultivation experiments similar to these were conducted by the Bureau of Plant Industry, United States' Department of Agriculture </seg>
            <seg id="p150">REI-ORT OK NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OK AGRICULTURE in 28 different states extending from the Atlantic to the Pacific, in all 125 experiments were recorded. As a result of this work extend - ing over a period of six years they arrived at this conclusion: "The results point strongly to the conclusion that the principal object of cultivation is the destruction of weeds. Where the weeds, can be kept down by some other method, cultivation seems to be of no par - ticular advantage." The Illinois Agricultural Experiment Station conducted for sev - eral years a similar experiment. As a result of this work they drew the following conclusion: "As an average of 16 tests in eight years, killing weeds without cultivation produced a gain of 6.7 bushels per acre over ordinary cultivation, the cultivated soil, especially in per - iods of drouth, is too loose and dry for proper root development, consequently the plant is deprived of the food which it contains." There is sufficient evidence from many different sources to justify us in drawing the conclusion that on well prepared land cultivation is of benefit to corn because it kills weeds and for no other purpose. When it is possible to control weeds to some extent by a good rotation of crops or by timely tillage, it is possible to reduce the amount of cultivation and thereby reduce the cost of growing the corn crop. When corn is free oX weeds cultivation is not only un - necessary and a needless expense, but may actually reduce the yield of the crop. There is no reason . to believe that a mower wheel dragged between the rows of corn in a dry period or any other work of this character is even beneficial to a clean crop of corn. Conclusions I desire to leave with you these ideas in conclusion: 1. Plowing and ordinary methods of cultivation are beneficial chiefly because they are our most effective methods of killing weeds. 2. If weeds are killed moisture will be conserved and ' plant food in available form will accumulate in the soil. 3. Since shallow plowing is usually as effective in killing weeds at deep plowing and much cheaper It is doubtful if frequent deep plowing is justified. 4. Deep. plowing may be necessary occasionally in order- to In - corporate organic matter with the soil and for the purpose of en - abling the soil to absorb moisture more rapidly. 5. The depth that it will be advisable to plow will probably depend upon the amount of organic matter available for incorporation with the soil. When the supply is limited, medium' shallow plowing will probably give more profitable returns than deep plowing. The depth of plowing may be increased as the supply of organic matter is increased. 6. It is doubtful under average farm conditions if it pays to plow deeper than six to seven inches. </seg>
            <seg id="p151">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION 7. Plowing under proper conditions improves the tilth of the soil. The more humid the climate and the heavier the soil the of - tener reasonably deep plowing is necessary. 8. Ground should be plowed for wheat as long in advance of seeding as is possible in ordinary methods of rotation. Plowing kills weeds, incorporates crop residues in the soil, and makes possible the accumulation of available plant food. 9. Cultivate corn to kill weeds and for no other purpose. 10. A good rotation of crops controls weeds and thereby re - duces the cost of plowing and cultivation. It may be possible for you to reduce the cost of growing crops on your farm if you fully understand the why in "Why do we plow." .VUIiRASICA WEED PESTS AND THEIR CONTROL By F. D. KEIM It has been conservatively estimated that ' weeds cost Nebraska farmers on the average two dollars annually for every tilled acre. According to Nebraska census figures there are 17,117,000 acres of tilled crops in Nebraska. This means an annual loss of $34,234,000 each year. On farms that are badly infested with perennial weeds such as the little white morning glory (Convolvulus arvense) or the tan weed (Polygonlm Mehlenbergii) the loss far exceeds this amount. A weed is said to be a plant growing out of place. We have pig-weeds in the corn, cheat in the wheat, artichokes in the oats, wire grass and blue grass in alfalfa, smart weeds and blazing stars in prairie hay, gum weeds and ragweeds in the pasture, and dodder in the red d|over. In fact one seldom sees a meadow, pasture or culti - vated field without a few weeds. Some' of these weeds are annuals, some biennials and some are perennials. The annuals and biennials usually spread by seed, but the perennials can either spread by seeds, or. underground parts or by both. Weeds a Serious Menace It. L. Clark round in making a weed survey by townships in one of our central Nebraska counties, that it was not uncommon to find an entire quarter section of land Infested with the little white morn - ing glory. In some of these townships scarcely a quarter section was entirely free from this pest. Figure 1 shows a drawing of one of these surveyed counties.' The patches of the perennial weeds are shown by the circles. Not all of these circles represent the little white morn - ing glory but most of them do. </seg>

            <seg id="p153">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION 1&gt;im reuse in Yields Due to Morning tilories The actual loss in yield due to morning glory infestation is strik - ing. The comparative yields, for wheat, oats, and alfalfa were taken in three foot quadrats, one in the infested area and the other directly adjacent but with no morning glories. The conditions in every respect, soil, stand, and growing conditions were kept as uniform as possible. The wheat, oats, and alfalfa growing on the morning glory infested areas showed a loss In yield of 39.0, 39.3, 69.34 per cent respectively over the unlnfested area. Corn showed a loss of 29.1 per cent. It is rather difficult to show yield data of this kind that would represent all fa-ids and conditions, because there is a very great variance. Nevertheless this data shows rather clearly that where morning glories are present, the yields are almost sure to be distinctly reduced. Observations seem to indicate that morning glories respond to fertility equally as well as the crops themselves. Land that lias been seeded to sweet clover, and built up by rotations and the adding of manure, is quite likely to grow a very dense growth of these vines and in -fact this weed is more likely to choke out a crop on rich land than it is on poor land. Means of Spread As has been mentioned before most annual weeds spread by seed. Perennials not only spread by seed but many of them spread by under - ground stems or modified roots. In years past it was the opinion of many that the little white morning glory spread chiefly by vegetative growth. Recent studies have shown that this weed pest under, cer - tain conditions seeds very heavily. In one wheat field in York County, Nebraska, as many as 26,000 morning glory seeds with a germination of 56 per cent, were picked out of a bushel of winter wheat. These samples were taken directly from the threshing machine. To plant seed wheat containing that many morning glory seeds is little less than a tragedy. Especially If this newly seeded wheat land was free from morning glories. The danger of the threshing machine, bundle racks, etc., scattering the seed of course is a serious menace. There, is danger also of the vines hanging on to the plow or cultivator shovels, but I doubt If this is as Important a means of spread as we once thought. Personally I do not think that is as serious a means of spread as' the seed. Means of Eradication Two methods of eradicating bad perennial weeds are generally recommended. These are the use of Chlorates and clean cultivation. Other methods such as seeding down to grass or alfalfa, or pasturing heavily with hogs or sheep are used to some extent. These latter methods are fairlf effective with some of the perennials but have not proven very practical for the morning glory. </seg>

            <seg id="p156">REPORT OK NEBRASKA STATE HOARD OK AGRICULTURE The Chlorate Method The usual method has been to dissolve one pound of chlorate in one gallon of water and apply this at the rate of at least 100 gallons per acre, which is usually a sufficient amount of the solution to moisten all of the leaves and stems of the vegetation. It is usually necessary to do this three times during the season. The chlorates dissolve slowly and care should be taken to see that the salt is all in solution. During the last year or two, very good kills have been obtained in some tests by treating weed patches with the dry chlorate salt, rather late in the fall. It is very necessary that the salt be dis - tributed evenly over the area treated.

The single fall treatment may be applied in spray form, by treating the area with the full amount of chlorate in one spraying. It is somewhat easier to get an even distribution when applied as a spray. ' Time to Apply If the three spray method Is used the first application should be made about the time the plants start to blossom. The second should be applied when the plants have again made a good, vigorous growth and the third in September or October. Octdber seems to be the best month for the single treatment. It is quite necessary that it be put on before the ground freezes in the fall. Amounts to Apply Results up to the present time Indicate that at least two pounds per square rod is necessary for good kills.

Sweet clover is one of the most chlorate tolerant crops for treated areas. Complete Kradication in One Season Not Likely Results at present indicate. that follow-up work is necessary dur - ing the season following treatment. Complete kills during one season or treatment do not seem to be the rule. Kills have been satisfac - tory enough, however, that by spraying or dry salting the few surviv - ing weeds complete eradication can be had. Precautions Precautions must be observed where sodium chlorate is used. Some very serious accidents happen every year in spite of the fact everyone is urged to be extremely careful. Clothing, wood, vegeta - tion, and similar materials when sprayed or soaked with a solution of sodium chlorate and then dried are very inflammable and care must be used to prevent fires. Shoes which have been soaked with the solution and allowed to dry may catch fire, merely from the friction of walking. Rubber boots should always be worn while using this material. The boots and clothing should be washed im - mediately after each operation. The sodium chlorate solution should always be kept in metal containers and stirred with a metal rod or else the wooden stick used for stirring should be destroyed. . Store sodium chlorate in metal containers in a dry, clean room away from hay, straw, sulphur, or other materials which may cause trouble from fires. Due to the calcium chloride which it contains, calcium chlorate (Atlaclde) is not inflammable, as has been described for sodium chlorate, and from the standpoint of fire danger it is safer to use. Clean Cultivation Should Not Be Forgotten It has been observed that new bindweed plants may start rapidly from seeds which have infested the soil. Care must be taken to pre - vent such plants from reinfesting treated areas. It would seem best to grow cultivated crops on treated areas so as to permit the destruc - tion of all seedlings. The use of chlorates seems best adapted for use on small, patches of noxious weeds. Where the infested area is large and the plants scattered widely, it does not seem to be a particularly practical method. In cases where large fields are infested, the use of the duck foot cultivator in connection with summer' fallow, seems to be worthy of consideration. Two years of fallow carefully done will usually eradi - cate the bindweed, Canada thistle, and similar weeds. In view of a cost of at least $30 per acre for chemicals in addition to the labor of applying three sprays, the use of summer fallow may well be con- </seg>
            <seg id="p159">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION sidered. Many crops following summer fallow will do better than ordinary due to the. accumulation of soil moisture and nitrates, while those on. sprayed areas probably may be expected to be somewhat less thrirty than usual. The use of chemical sprays, however, seems to offer a satisfactory method for the eradication of small isolated patches of noxious perennial weeds. - * Use of Clean Seed There should be a greater' appreciation of the value of high quality weed-free seed. The use of cheap low quality seed is often the method by which serious weed pests gain access to Nebraska farms. Bindweed often spreads from field to field or from farm to farm by means of small grain seed, threshing crews, machinery, and possibly by means of hay and manure. Prevention is better than a cure. It is wise to be critical of seed supplies brought in and to identify each new kind of weed that makes its appearance. REPORT OF THE 1929 NEBRASKA COUN YIELD CONTEST P. H. STEWART and D. L. GROSS Each year the interest in the Nebraska 10-acre Corn Yield Con - test is increasing. In 1929, 230 men entered the contest. A high percentage of these men completed the contest by reporting the yields, labor requirements and rotation and cultural practices. More men finished the contest than in any previous year. Of the total 135 men completing the work 55 were in the eastern region, 32 in the central, 27 in the western and 21 in the irrigated section. Seven men grew 100 bushels or more corn per acre on their 10 acre lields. During the previous 5 years of the contest only 5 men! have grown 100 bushels or more per acre. A favorable season plus good cultural practices made this splendid record. : The Rules for the 1929 Contest The 1929 contest rules were practically the same as those fol - lowed the past three or four years. In order that the reader may have some idea of the plan followed the following digest of the rules has been made: Any person more than 18 years of age may enter a field of corn of 10 or more acres on which he must submit a report giving rota - tion, cultural and labor data. Contestants are scored on the 'basis of 65 per cent for yield, 25 per cent for profit per acre, and 10 per cent for the quality of the product. The state was divided into four sections. </seg>
            <seg id="p160">REPORT OK NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Rent was charged on the share basis this being arbitrarily set at 2/5 in the eastern and irrigated sections, and 1/3 in the central and western sections. Corn was valued at 75 cents for No. 1 corn with 14 per cent moisture. Man labor was valued at 35 cents per hour, and horse labor at 20 cents per. hour, this to cover machinery depreciation; making an actual cost of about 16 cents per horse hour. Husking was charged at 10 cents per bushel to cover labor, wagon,, team, and board. Tractors were figured on a scale ranging as fol - lows: 2 bottom plow tractors $1.25 per hour, 3 bottom plow tractors $1.50 per hour and 4 bottom sizes $1.75 per hour. This also covers depreciation on the machinery which they pull. Except for a few fields which were obviously low in yield, 20 liound samples of ear corn were taken at husking time for shrinkage, shelling and moisture determinations. Yields were figured on shelled corn with 14 per cent moisture. Gold medals were given regional winners and silver medals to county champions when there were eight or. more contestants. Cash prizes of $15, $10 and $5 were paid to the three highest men in each region.

If a yield contest can demonstrate thru actual records what rotation and cultural prac - tices give the best and most profitable results then it is of some value. A contest just to see who can grow the most corn per acre without some study being made as to why certain practices are good or bad, would be of little, if any, value except possibly as an advertising proposition. An effort has been made therefore to study out this year, as In past years, the principles underlying the high or particularly profit - able yields to learn if possible what practices were carried on that might be more generally adopted by the farmers of Nebraska. A study of the records seems to justify the following conclu - sions most of which have been brought out in previous contests but which are again substantiated by this year's contest. 1. In eastern Nebraska during years with normal or above ltormal climatic conditions, and under irrigation, the maintenance of soil fertility thru the growing of legumes is the most important factor in the production of high and profitable corn yields. 2. There Is a continued increase in the use of labor and time paving machinery by corn growing farmers in all parts of the state. There is considerable variation in the efficiency of certain individual farmers. 3. The labor costs of raising corn decreases from east to west across the state which makes it possible for central and western Ne - braska farmers to make a profit from lower yields of corn than would he profitable In the eastern part. </seg>
            <seg id="p163">NEBItASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION | 4. While a large crop or corn in the corn belt niay mean low returns to corn growers who sell their corn as grain, yet so far as the individual farmer is concerned his profit per acre is in direct proportion to the yield providing normal cultural costs prevail. 5. Under eastern Nebraska conditions with average labor costs end the rent charged at the rate specified in the contest it would take u 20 bushel corn crop to pay production costs figuring corn at 75 cents per bushel. Where family labor is used this may not be true. An irrigated field In 1929 produced 108.7 bushels per mere, the record yield for the 6 years of the Nebraska 10-acre Corn Yield Contest. Legumes, Soil Fertility and Yields It was shown in the 1927 and 1928 contests that there was a close correlation between the use of legumes in the rotation and the yield* of corn in eastern Nebraska. The analyses of soil samples, for instance, showed that the high yields were grown on soils high In organic matter while low organic matter fields produced low yields. The 1929 contest again emphasized the importance of legumes grown in the corn rotation in eastern Nebraska and under irriga - tion. Carl Day and Son of Weeping Water, who won first in the eastern region, grew 107 bushels of corn on a field which has been broken out only 4 years from sod. Mr. Day has had this field entered in the contest tor three years. In 1927 and 1928 thin stands and bard winds hurt the yields as the field made 71 and 77 bushels. </seg>
            <seg id="p164">REPORT OK NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OK AGRICULTURE It is Interesting to know that in 1909-10 I'rof. F. J. Alway of the Agricultural College sampled this particular field of native prairie in a study of the loess soil of the state. Of 6 fields sampled in Cass county this field was outstanding in fertility showing .255% nitrogen or 5.10% organic matter. This field is fundamentally a very fertile one. Chris Hinz, second in the eastern section, whose farm lies in the steep loess hills south of Blair, maintains his fields with sweet clover. He follows a 3 year rotation of corn, oats and sweet clover, and sweet clover- pastured off. The records show that of the 10 high men only the 4 th and 10th were on bottom land, all of the rest were upland fields. These ten high fields average 1.8 years since they were seeded down to grass or legumes. Their average yield was 98.4 bushels per acre. Of the entire group of 55 men in the eastern section 37 men or 67% were. on upland soils. They grew an average of 74.7 bushels. This showed that the contestants were not men who had a particularly favorable piece of bottom land for their contest field. The records show that the fields of all of the 55 contestants in the eastern region average 4.4 years since they were seeded down, with an average yield ot 77.6 bushels per acre. . Table 1 shows a summary of rotation data on yield in the various sections of Nebraska. The figures for the eastern and irrigated sec - tions preach a sermon for themselves on the importance of soil fer - tility and value of legumes.

Irrigation farming is expensive and it is doubly important that soil fertility be high. There is no profit in irrigating corn on soils which are not fertile and which do not have great potential producing powers providing water is available. </seg>

Farmers of central and western Nebraska commonly recognize the difficulty and danger In planting legume land, particularly alfalfa land, to corn due to the fact that the large amount of available nit - rogen in the soil tends to produce a large plant growth which suffers severely during drought periods common in that part of the state. The fact that farmers have entered in the contest, fields which have Leen farmed from 20 to 25 years on the average shows that this 1-oint is appreciated. Increased Use of Power by Farmers Much lias beett--sald recently about the increased efficiency of farmers. The Nebraska corn yield contest data show that Nebraska fanners are not standing still in the matter of making use of more power per man as a time saver and method for greater net returns.

The eastern Nebraska contestants have reduced their time per acre from 8.9 hours to 6.2 or 30 per cent from 1924 to 1929. The central Nebraska farmers since 1924 have reduced their man hours per acre from 7.0 to 3.6 or practically 50 per cent. Western Nebraska farmers during the same 6 year period show a decrease from 4.5 man hours to 2.9 man hours or a decrease of 35 per. cent. The method of planting corn as to listing or surface planting makes a considerable difference in the amount of man labor required per acre. Table III shows an analysis of the 55 men in the eastern section as to the method of planting and the yields and labor re - quirements.

Since 50 per cent of them listed this means that half of the men . who listed plowed the land first. The practice of plowing legume land shallow, then listing it to corn to overcome, at least in part, over-stimulation and excessive plant growth due to the high fertility is a good and growing practice. This makes the labor records for the men who listed higher than it would be for ordinary listed corn. It is of interest to note the difference in cultural practices in the different parts of Nebraska.

This is due to the more level topography, a more friable soil, and less rainfall to produce weed growth. In general due to greater climatic hazards the farming in western Nebraska is of the extensive type adapted to regions of lower land values where the production per man is a greater factor than the charge against .land for rent. The question is often asked as to what it costs to raise a bushel of corn. This is hard to answer. It is difficult to Isolate one farm enterprise by itself and charge against it all of the costs that should be so charged, yet not over-charge. Corn, for instance, works well in a rotation scheme. Crops do better following corn than after any other grain crop. Hence there is a benefit following corn that [ac - crues to other crops. Shall corn get this credit?

We cannot keep our land in corn all of the time but its costs must be dovetailed Into those of other crops. The relationship of corn to diversification and livestock production is in favor of corn. Possibly some of the. profits from feeding corn to livestock should be given credit to corn thereby reducing its cost of production or at least add - ing to its cash values. *„ \ : DELATION XyIELD TO PQOF\T . 1\T. 1929- VlELD —^^X I I CONTEST I I \\ \ BAS.TtMl&gt;i 6CCTIOA* i t3 N^\ . | | j | ; r _I -S5V -_ H*IO 1; 1 1 1 1 1— -W( " A\7.

It is well appreciated by those in charge of the Corn Yield Con - test that the yields of the contestants are much above the average.. As stated in the beginning of this report, high yields are not the goal of the contest but rather the measuring stick of good methods. In other words where the yields are high they should point to particu - larly good corn production methods of value to all corn growers. It is believed, however, that the labor costs of growing corn as reported by the contestants are average and about normal for their sections. An effort has therefore been made to use these costs in connection with average corn yields as reported by the federal statistician to ar- </seg>
            <seg id="p169">NEBRASKA CHOP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION rive at an approximation of the costs of growing corn as well as mis can be done. Table VI gives this data. Anyone interested can take the average acre horse and man costs for his section, add to this the liusking charge, pay the share rent that he must pay and by dividing the total cost by the bushels of corn left after deducting for rent, secure a figure approximating the cost of a bushel of corn under his conditions and with his own yields. Relation of Yield to Profit Some folks have objected to the corn yield contest on the basis that it would promote larger corn crops with a resulting lower price. The objectors pointed out that large corn crops over the corn belt . often mean low prices and consequently a lower total cash value for all corn grown than during years when the crop is small. So far as all corn growers are concerned this is unquestionably true, yet so far as the individual farmer is concerned high acre yields are necessary for him- to make a profit. As one Nebraska farmer put it, he never made a cent on a crop which he did not grow or did not have regard - less of what the market price might be. It must also be recognized that more than 85 per cent of our corn is marketed thru livestock, hence livestock and livestock product prices more truly reflect the income to Nebraska farmers from their corn than does the cash price. Moreover it has been shown that in order to raiBe high corn yields particularly in the corn belt proper, it 1b necessary to have high soil fertility supplied Chiefly by legume crops. One cannot grow legume crops without taking the land out of corn or other grain crops, hence, when building up soil fertility by legumes we automatically reduce the acreage of land available for corn. This means fewer ■ acres in corn but more corn - on the acres that are planted to this crop. The total production due to the decreased corn acreage which is in legumes for hay, pasture, soil building, and seed, would be much the same. The graph in Figure I shows the relation of yield to profit in eastern Nebraska. Figured on the contest basis for all charges a 100 bushel yield of corn would make a profit above production costs ot about $30.00 per acre. On the same basis it would take a 20 bushel corn yield to pay expenses. A study of the graph shows i the range of the contestants due to variations in yield and production costs. : I ■'■•'■.'

MAGEE It now devolves upon me, in my official capacity, to present the winners of this year's Ten Acre Corn Yield Contest with the medals awarded to them by the Nebraska Crop Growers' Association for the contest which has been carried on during the last year. I am very glad to have the opportunity of doing this, and I am prompted to put forward my best foot in presenting these medals, because of the high standard which has been set by the men who have helped focus interest on this phase of the Crop Growers' program in the years that have gone by. However, I have no hope of doing this chore as well, as it has been done in' recent years by Chancellor Burnett or Dean Burr, yet I have no lack of desire to make this occasion all that I believe it should be. We Nebraska farmers, and particularly we men who have been farming actively since the post-war deflation set in, have experienced pretty hard sledding at times. There are many of us who have felt the pressure that has forced down our land values, and so eliminated our hope of an unearned increment attaching to our farms even though we made no money out of our sale of products. We have felt, some of us, that our standards of living. have been lowered be - cause of the lack of an Increased income to keep pace with our in - creased expenses, and as we have sat around our fireplaces and stoves at night. Borne of us have puzzled over why this condition should have been brought about, and wondered how we could go at it to right the situation as it effected us individually. I believe that it is characteristic of the class of men who go to these Crop Growers' meetings that they are the thinking element of the farming communities, and here at this meeting this week there are lots of us who have had the opportunity of sitting in on these discussions, and having brought home to us what the leaders in Agri - culture think are the troubles which are back of our present diffi - culties. As I see it, our program yesterday quite definitely brought out the fact that there are going on now in Agriculture two major lines of attack, both of which have in end the same view, that is, a bet - tering of the farmer's income. - In the first place we are particularly fortunate to have had with us at these winter meetings this year, Mr. Stone of the Federal Farm Board, who perhaps more than any other one. man can be said to typify the line of attack on this farm problem which has been made by the legislative powers in our country. ' These men on the Farm Board, and the men who have created the law under which the Farm Board is acting, have found that Agriculture is depressed, when I con - trasted with industry, through the direct result of legislation, ! and </seg>

AGRICULTURE they have gone at it to correct this legislation, or its results, and under the present law are in a position to put the producer in direct rontrol of his own marketing machinery, with the hope that this will bring about a readjustment in the business end of farming, and so aid the producer. That is but one phase of our farming business, but it has received a great deal of publicity, and the politicians have cap - italized the aid which they are endeavoring to extend to Agriculture. So much for what has been done for us as a class by others. Now look to the other side of the problem and see, if we can what we, as Crop Growers, have been doing to help ourselves. I refer par - ticularly to the points which were so well brought put in our meet - yOfa yesterday; the attempt that the Crop Growers have made to cut the costs of production on the individual farms — as this is the one thing which every man can apply to his own case. In our at - tempt to bring home to the farmers of Nebraska this part of the Crop Growers program, we have found that we could do certain things to nid the community as a whole, and so have put a great deal of em - phasis on the matter of using better seeds. We have found that the cost of production could be materially lowered by increasing the yields per acre by the use of so-called certified seed. This program has been rarried out, for instance, in the case of wheat in Nebraska, to an ex - tent where now it is conservatively estimated that one-half of the wheat acreage in Nebraska is annually sowed to improved strains. This year we have, as Crop Growers, certified the origin of something o\er two hundred thousand bushels of adapted seed. We put a lot of emphasis on the cultural practices and have shown in our program how the work of the multiple row machinery will materially cut the cost of production. But the one thing that has been of most effect of any of our activities is to direct attention to the fact that it is the larger yields, due to soil fertility, that will do more than anything else to cut the cost of production. So it is to bring home this matter of soil fertility that we have I&gt;ut emphasis on the Corn Yield Contest, and next year we are not limiting our contest to Crop Growers alone, but are beginning to teach the same story to the young men in junior contests. I wish that the class had not been called out as the things that I have prepared to say this morning are the kind of things which are entertaining to young people, and yet have a direct bearing on this problem of soil fertility. I have found that often in talking to Farmers' meetings you can best put your story over if you will give concrete examples out of your own experience, and so for a little while I am going to tell you of a trip I made when I was just out of college. You know the Ger - man habit of sending boys away from home for a year of wander - lust; well, that is the thing my Father did with me. He started me off, without funds, to follow his footsteps made forty years before </seg>
            <seg id="p173">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION ine, and in the course of a two year term I made the entire circuit of the world, working my way as I went. Now take, for instance, my first stop out in the Grand Canyon country of our Southwest. You know there the Zunie Indians have Crown corn from the earliest times. Many of their ruins contain evi - dences of a highly advanced civilization, who made use of a variety of corn which grew very close to the ground. This civilization has all been swept away for some reason or another, and here is the point that I want to leave with you; may be it was because those men did not know anything about maintaining soil fertility that now a days we find only the ruins of their, homes. I went on down into old Mexico and there I found the record of the Aztecs growing corn — not the corn we know today, but the corn which was in those days only a little way removed from a grass. But they had a very highly organized society which had perished for some reason or other. While down there I collected, among other things, a facsimile of their god of Corn, as they worshipped corn in those days in Mexico, and that plaster cast god is now on my mantle piece at home in Douglas County as a material reminder to me of a failed civilization — a civil - ization which perhaps failed because they knew nothing about main - taining their soil fertility. My trip took me up into North China where I ran on to great ruins left by the Ming Dynasty, as the only material evidence now left of a tremendous civilization which at one time occupied one of the large loess deposits of the world. These men farmed just the same soil that we have here in eastern Nebraska, but their clvilza - tion has crumbled and all that is left are the old relics in the way or temples and monuments built when their civilization flourished. I went on around to the Malay States and up the Valley of the Irowadie on the road to Mandalay, and there I found the ruins of towns larger than any towns now in the Mississippi Valley, and all of them with palm trees and grass now growing in their deserted streets because they enjoyed a civilization founded on Agriculture, and yet for some reason or other they have been unable to carry on this agriculture through the ages. Perhaps their fertility gave' out; they knew nothing of isobackers. I could carry this story on through the ruins of Java and in upper India, on the Nile and into the Holy Land, and in every! case it is the same — tremendously large fertile valleys at one time popu - lated by an agricultural people, who reached a high state of civiliza - tion and built temples in cities which have now fallen into decay, and where society has deteriorated because they could no longer pro - duce food stuffs in quantities to support the population — probably due to lack of fertility. Even we young men who have farmed for less than one hundred years have seen the fertility of our own fields here in eastern Nebraska grow less and less, and our corn yields shrink, not because of any lack of industry, but because we did not </seg>

HOW I DID IT! CARL DAY AND SON. Weeping Water Winner in the Eastern Section, With 107.4 Bushels I did not raise this 100 bushel corn myself, but Mr. Stewart was determined that I should tell about it today. For several years our farming and livestock operations have been conducted as Carl E. Day &amp; Sons. John has stayed with the short - horn 4-H calves until he got two in money ■ at the State Fair and two more at the Ak- Sar-Ben show. For three years Gene has entered a plot of 32 or 33 acres of corn in this state con - test. It surely pays to take the boys into the business early in the game, and any III &gt;*&amp;-*■ ... j-"»»i| honor due this achievement, (and I realize llfit^wsBB^lHl " is a great honor) is due to Gene, and the B^9 H only part I have in it is to tell the secret. ImJ^^^l '^KjlflH: In producing a record yield, we consider {S^^^^^^Hhlsj tnat the flrst and most important item is the HSfl^BBHl^ffSii: land, or the condition of the soil. This plot is new, having never been plowed until four EUGENE DAY years ago. In 1869 my father came out from Ohio and selected two quarter sections south of Weeping Water, Nebraska. One was broken at once and cropped. The other, being not quite so good, was reserved for hay and pasture. As soon as he got more stock, he sowed blue grass and clover on the </seg>
            <seg id="p175">NEBRASKA CROP CliOWKltS' ASSOCIATION prairie sod. It was a success and soon ran out the wild grass, and for many years the grazing of livestock has added fertility. Four years ago the first crop of corn had to be top planted, as the sod was too stiff to list. We also hit a dry season with only local showers and no reserved moisture' in the subsoil. So we raised! a big crop of .fodder, 25 shocks per acre and no ears on it. In 1927, Gene entered it in the State Contest, but the cut worms and grubs, together with wind damage later, put us out, wilth 76 bushels per acre. In 1928 the stand was better but a July wind damage was heavy, the yield being 79 bushels per acre. This year nothing disastrous happened, so you see our persever - ance is rewarded. This soil contains a large amount of humus. We still find little chunks of sod, one-half to one inch thru. Probably plenty of nitrogen and potash in the soil. Second in importance, we consider a good stand. That requires dependable seed that will germinate 95 per cent. It. should be dropped and covered right, fifteen to sixteen Inches apart. We chose smooth, medium sized ears of a common yellow dent variety, raised on our farm for years. In seed selection we avoid large ears with a heavy cob, because of too great moisture content. The third item of importance, is preparation and cultivation of the soil. Just ordinary effective work done at the proper time will produce good results. A year ago this land was spring plowed and then listed, so as to thoroughly mix the sod roots that remained. This year it had two diskings, the first as early as possible, the second about a week before listing. . My field labor on 33 acres consisted of three days of disking — one man and six horses; two days listing — one man and six horses; and six days cultivating — one man and four horses. My first cul - tivating was with a disc, two-row, throwing out. My others were a regular two-row -shovel plow. We do not advise riding the ground the last time any more than is necessary to get it clean. There is a proper time, as you all know, when the soil is moist but not too wet, and weeds are germinating but not too large, so that a -cultivation does the most efficient work. Perhaps, we were fortunate to be on the job at the proper time. We also think it a great advantage if we can do the last plowing about as late as we can get thru the field without breaking off the corn. We will be interested in the production cost per bushel of this plot, as we think it was produced with the least possible hours prac - tical when using horses. However, husking adds a lot to the per bushel cost of 100 bushel corn. The general average yield of 147 acres on the two farms was 70 bushels per acre. 7 </seg>

Well matured ears were field selected during the latter part of September and the fore part of October to be hung, seasoned and drid before cold weather sets In. The ground was plowed about seven inches deep — harrowed once before planting and once after planting. The planter was as usual carefully checked for. mechanical per - fection and the field planting began May 8, 1929. It was harrowed immediately after planting and cultivated three times.

            <seg id="p177">NEUUASKA CHOP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION HOW I Dill IT LEE FARRIS, Union Third Place In the Eastern Section, With 104.7 Bushels The plowed ground I used was on the low side of an old pas - lure. Personally, I know that for 25 years it had not been farmed. Some of the neighbors say they do not re- H- member of it ever having been farmed, so it perhaps just drifted into blue grass sod. I broke this. The ground sloped up to the east and it was an irregular piece of ground with water along one side." To avoid this I ran my fence so it made an irregular piece. This low ground, as I said awhile ago. drifted to blue grass sod. The east part of this was farmed for years and was in a run down condition. It was sown to alfalfa and left for five years. The stand then began to get rather thin and I used It as pasture for cattle. It laid there for 9 years. lee farris I broke the entire piece in the fall of 1928 and then planted to corn in the spring of 1929. So this flat or west half of my field was what you might call level ground. I listed it, using the combine lister, and got almost a perfect stand. The corn on that grew very rank, in fact the season being wet in our section of the state, caused it to be late in planting it being planted the 30th of May. However, the season later helped me out some on that. It matured in very good shape and was very good corn. Our county agent came and weighed and tested the corn. They made 5 tests in the plot and as they went east into higher ground the stand was less, of course, than It was down on the west, but, on the whole, it was a very good stand on the entire plot of ground. The corn was cultivated three times with a Badger cultivator. Perhaps, I got ahead of my story. I disked the ground twice in the spring, once each way, which put it in mighty jrood shape. We planted medium sized ears of the yellow dent var - iety. I did not use the larger ears for the reason that it was getting rather late to plant corn and I thought the smaller ears would be the best type of corn to use on this type of land at the time It was being planted. QUESTION: How deep did you cultivate the corn? ANSWER.: I just cultivated what I might call a medium depth, neither deep or shallow. </seg>

This year I had other alfalfa land to break up for beets so put this field into corn. County Agent Hepperly called and wanted me to enter the corn yield contest so I entered this 10-acre plot. </seg>
            <seg id="p179">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION In beet farming they tell us to plow rather deep so the first year it was plowed 10 inches deep and the second year 12 inches. In 1928 It was plowed about 8 inches deep. This year it was plowed, har - rowed, double disked 'and then harrowed for corn. Another thing, before I come to the planting of this corn, is a fact that we sort of had hammered into us by the sugar companies. In planting beets we plant rows 20 Inches apart, having 85 beets per 100 feet of row. Practically every inch' of the ground is in the crop. That goes to show you my idea of growing corn in this way. They claim ihat. If a man does not have his beets 14 inches apart you are farming only part of the ground. That gave me the idea for corn. Why not put your corn closer together and farm all your ground? I used a planter, narrowing it to 30 inches as the width of the rows. My stand was 86 stalks of corn per 100 feet. This figures out 26,000 beets! to an acre of beets, but corn being 30 inches wide instead of 20 gives two - thirds or about 17,000 stalks of corn on each acre. In the 10-acre corn yield contest, I had but two horses in the field. I never used a corn cultivator . in the field and never had a shovel in the field. I used the beet cultivator, cultivating 2 rows at a time. I used two disks at each side of the rows. The first time over I just covered what little weeds were coming- up. I went over it three times, shoving the disk down bo it made quite a ridge as I wanted to make a good ditch between each row to irrigate. I really got every weed but there were a few that came up later on. It took just ten hours work to hoe out the plat. I had a little. time between then and beet cultivation so started the water on my corn. Then I kept watering my beets and just got in one more cultivation on my corn which takes it into silk, so my corn got two more irrigations. Later on I had a little time and irrigated three acres a third time — it wan past roasting ear timei The variety of corn used was a white corn Father brought from Polk county. He had grown it 6 or 7 years before he found a decent shaped ear. Most of this corn is white with a red cob — probably the .-it. Charles variety. Several county agents, Kellogg of Lincoln, Biedermann of Dawes, "and Jay Hepperly, all preached smooth ears for seed com. I always pick out a rough ear with a deep kernel. An extra long growing sea - son was one thing we had in our favor this year In western Nebraska. Ordinarily we do not have nearly so long a season as you fellows do down here, the average running 18 days or three weeks shorter. This year was hot and dry. It never rained from June until the latter part of September. The nights were fairly warm but not as warm as it is here, and it all worked in our favor. Thank you. QUESTION: What would your yield have been with smooth corn? From 10 to 20 per cent added to your field would have made a whopper. </seg>

The last word is irrigation and as corn being more or less of a water plant there is no limit to the amount of water it will consume so long as you don't smother it by leaving water on it too long at a time. My advice for seed is to select the big heavy yielding yellow with a moderate dent. I have the yellow dent that will run 26 to 32 rows to the ear and weighs a pound. </seg>

WADLEY, Gibbon Third Place in the Irrigated Section There are three reasons which I believe enabled me to produce my high yielding corn. First, I had fertile rich soil, second, a Hvery uniform stand of corn, and third, I ap - plied plenty of water by means of an irriga - tion pump. In order to realize very great returns from the irrigating one must farm the ground very deep, having lots of loose soil to throw up around the corn. The water will then run very slowly giving the ground time to absorb' plenty of moisture. If the ground isn't soaked deep down the first time it does not get enough moisture as the ground is crusted, the second time, allowing the water to run too fast only soaking in a s. a. wadley very short depth.

This land had been in alfalfa tor about 20 years or longer, until the blue grass crowded the alfalfa out. I plowed this land in June, 1927, put it in wheat in the fall, the next spring, 1928, put it in corn, bought water for it but did not get a stand of corn. The corn made about 70 bushels. In the spring of 1929 I put it in corn and entered it in the contest. First, I single disked the ground and then I went back and single disked it again then I harrowed and about May 8th I listed it in corn using yellow dent seed, care - fully selected. It was planted about 10 or 11 inches apart. It was cultivated twice with a three-row cultivator and it was watered twice about two weeks apart.

ENGLAND, Ralston Winner in Douglas County Contest with 94.9 Bushels In handling our ten acre field, it was necessary to build up our soil to secure better yields. The farm had been under cultivation over fifty years, and during the period up to 1916 inclusive, it had been planted to corn, wheat, and oats, never having been manured. Naturally soil was deficient in humus and organic matter. ' Starting with 1917, we started to build up soil, as I knew in order to secure better yields, necessary to assist nature by putting in the necessary elements to replace what you take out of the soil, our formula being alfalfa or sweet clover with oats for rotation. We favor sweet clover, fifteen pounds, and oats, two bushels to the acre, broadcasted with seeder. We have used manure liberally as always had considered live stock on feed, consisting of cattle, hogs and sheep. Our practice in rotating sweet clover and oats first year, sec - ond year for pasture, and then plow under in fall or spring and plant to corn for two years. This method of rotating our fields is handled eo that we have no field in corn over two years. The field that was used in this contest was handled in the fol - lowing manner: Spring, 1927, was planted to sweet clover and oats producing fifty-two bushels Nebraska 21 Certified Oats per acre. After the oats were cut and out of the way, three hundred hogs had access to this field the balance of the season, and were able to keep growth down so was not too rank. The following spring, 1928, we used it for pasture, having from one hundred to one hundred and fifty head of cattle remain about Tour hours daily. As cattle were on feed, our aim was to turn them in about 10:00 A.

I decided to plow about ten acres of it as I had more pasture than I could use so that spring It was plowed. This spring it was plowed the latter part of April and left for awhile so the sod lumps left over from the year before would be easier to break up with the disk and harrow later on. I did not put any fertilizer on the field in the spring or fall because there were plenty of corn stalks without putting on any other fertilizer. When the field was plowed I used a section of a harrow behind the plow to help break the lumps of soil. It was then disked twice and each time I used a three section harrow behind the disk to help break up the lumps as the disk had not done a good job of breaking. After the ground was in good condition, it was planted, having the planter set to'put 2 and 3 kernels to a hill. In some places there was volunteer corn left over from the crop the previous year.

GOODDING Nebraska Agricultural College The farmers of the corn belt may. be at variance in their opin - ions with reference^ to the ear type to select for seed purposes but the corn growers, at least, in the Nebraska section of the corn belt, through experience, have quite largely hit upon one common con - clusion and that is that they can not import seed from a distance and expect it to yield with native corn in the locality where it is to be planted. Striking n Italance Between Knvironmental Conditions and Plant Characters If an eastern Nebraska corn grower obtains seed corn say 100 miles to the south it is apt to produce a crop which will not ma - lure before frost and as a result the ears will be soggy and the kernels, shaffy. On the other hand if he se-- cures seed corn from 100 miles to the west H H it is a Pt to mature too early, failing to take iaSP^sESufl^^HBH full advantage of the growing season with a IsM consequent reduction in yield as compared HgM^^^^j witli native corn.

H. GOODDING grower claims that through selection he has developed, a better adapted strain of corn. Corn Adaptation Important The degree of adaptation of corn to the locality in which it is being grown depends upon the degree of harmony between the plant requirement and its environmental growth conditions. For example </seg>
            <seg id="p187">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION if the environmental factors .such as available moisture, character of the growing season and length of the growing season are placed in one pan of a pair of balances and the plant characters such as leaf area, plant height and ear height are placed in the other pan in order to bring about a balanced condition it will probably be necessary to adjust the weight in one of the pans. Since the inherited tendencies environmental factors are largely climatic they are more or less fixed consequently if any adjustment is to be made it will have to take place in the plant Character pan. When the leaf area, stalk height and ear height have so been adjusted as to cause the pointer on the balances to stand in a perpendicular position the plant characters stand in such a relation to the environmental conditions as to give the highest yield of sound grain. The greater the degree of balance between the plant characters and the environmental conditions under which the crop is grown year after year the higher the yield of sound grain per acre which in turn indicates that the corn has reached a higher degree of adaptability. In selecting the correct ear type the corn grower should first study the environmental conditions under which the corn is to be grown and then' work toward a corn type which possesses the plant characters that will make the greatest economical use of the ' avail - able plant food and moisture for the length of the growing season in that particular locality. • Climate a Limiting Factor in Corn Production From a climatic point of view Nebraska is a state of conslder - uble range. The growing season along our southern boundary varies from 165 days in Richardson County to 140 days in Dundy County while the rainfall varies from 32 to 18 inches. The altitude in Rlch - t rdson County is about 1,000 feet while the altitude in Dundy County is 3,500 feet. The length of the growing season in any part of Nebraska is determined by either altitude, the elevation above sea level, or lati - tude, the distance from the equator, or both. Since the fortieth parallel of latitude marks the southern most boundary of Nebraska - any change in the length of the growing season along this line will be due to elevation or altitude, There is a difference of 25 days in the growing season of .Richardson . and Dundy Counties while theru is a difference of 2,500 feet in altitude. In other words for every 100 feet in elevation along the southern most border there is a days dif - ference in the growing season. There is a days difference in the growing season for every 10 to 12 miles one travels in a direct north and south line. Approaching northwestern Nebraska from a south - easternly direction one finds the growing season becoming shorter than if traveling directly north or west as both altitude and longitude factor in this case. </seg>

The more favorable precipi - tation in northeastern Nebraska tends to counterbalance the more favorable temperature and longer growing season of localities on a diagonal line to the southeast in their effect upon the hereditary Ki-owth habits of the corn.* Keglonal Adaptation of Cora in Nebraska In their bulletin "The Regional Adaptation of Corn in Nebraska," Kiesselbach and Keim oh comparing adapted Lancaster County, Ne - braska, corn with adapted Kimball County, Nebraska, corn, when both were grown under favorable conditions of Lancaster County, show that Lancaster County corn ripened 18 days later, produced plants which were 40% taller, bore the ears 1507 o higher above the ground, had 138% greater leaf area per plant, and produced 100% greater total dry matter per plant. The ears were 123% heavier, and had a 10% higher shelling percentage. These inherited differences are ascribed primarily to the normal climatic differences, of the two re - gions. The climate of Lancaster county as compared with Kimball county is 7°F warmer during the corn-growing season, the frost-free period is 35 days longer, and the precipitation is 13 inches or 81% higher. Relation of Ear Typo t» Plant Character*! If the conditions under which an ear of corn is produced are known one can expect that the ear will reflect the type of stalk on which it grew. For instance if an ear is somewhat smooth, horny s.hallow grained and slender with 16 rows of kernels, the tendency would be to associate such ear characteristics with a stalk having less height, less leaf area and bearing the ear closer to the ground than if the ear were rough, starchy and deep grained with a greater num - ber of rows of kernels. In his Bulletin on "Productive Seed Corn," Kiesselbach gives results of three tests conducted at the Nebraska Experiment Station which favor the long smooth ear type selections over the deep, rough kernel type. "During the G years, 1906-1910, long, smooth ears of Reid Yel - low Dent corn with kernels of only medium depth were compared for yield at the Nebraska Experiment Station with the standard medium rough corn of the same variety. Continuous selection of the smooth ears was practiced in this test. As an average for the 6 years the long, smooth ears yielded 57.3 bushels, and the standard type 53 3 bushels per acre. In a 2-year test (1916-1317) with Hogue Yellow Dent corn seed ears; with relatively shallow, smooth kernels surpassed ears with deep. </seg>

            <seg id="p192">REPORT OK NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE WHAT ABOUT CORN HYBItlDS? T. A. KIESSELBACH Hybrid corn! What is it? And why this endless talk about corn hybrids? Interest in the new kind of corn has grown almost to a white heat throughout the. corn belt. I feel that I am about lo catch the fever myself. To see is to believe. When one visits corn fields where the best of farm varieties are being compared with a collection of corn hybrids developed by a new method of corn breed - ing and finds that the most attractive and the most, productive sorts always belong to the hybrid group, conviction cannot be far distant. Hybrid corn is corn "made to order." The best standard farm varieties are taken to pieces, as it were, and re-assembled. The in - ferior stuff is junked and new plants are created from the best in - heritance which the commercial varieties have contained. It is the same method as has been followed in the improvement of our mod - ern machinery. But in the case of corn, knowledge of how to un - scramble the old varieties and remove the inferior qualities is of very recent origin. It is a complicated process. Much has been ac - complished, but much more is expected of the future. The new method recognizes that in the natural development of corn, both favorable and unfavorable qualities have arisen, and that these have remained combined within the ordinary varieties as a result of the continual cross-fertilization which occurs under field conditions. It is the business of the modern corn breeder to remove these depressing characters. Let us see how this is done. Principles or the New Method The procedure consists of reconstructing hybrid seed following a selective process during a period of inbreeding, or self-fertilization. In the terms of the corn breeder, this method is known as "selection Within self-fertilized lines." As a result of the inbreeding, which usually should continue for 5 or more years, a great number of so - called "selfed lines" is produced. They may range from very un - desirable to very attractive. The first impression that one gets from some of them is that they are misfits or monstrosities, some of which are scarcely able to exist because of various short-comings. These weaknesses may consist of such characters as stalk weakness, pro - fuse suckering, sterile tassels, defective plant color, disease suscep - tibility, extreme earliiiess or lateness of maturity, dwarfness, low grain production, and poor grain quality. The inbreeding' accom - panied by selection serves to eliminate much of such inheritance from the foundation breeding stock. On the other hand, a comparatively small number of outstandingly attractive selfed lines come into being. These may seem to possess only good qualities, such as lodge-resist - ance, good dark green foliage, freedom from suckers, disease resist- </seg>
            <seg id="p193">NEBRASKA, CHOP GROWER!*'' ASSOCIATION ance. timely maturity, de-Klrable stalk and oar height,. high prodiictiv - y and choice grain quality. While all gradations may exist between tie two groups of desirable and undesirable plant characters, the con - structive breeding work conaists in isolating these most desirable lines and testing them in hybrid combination. For it is the hybrids upon which we must depend for the commercial grain crop. i The selfed lines so far reported anywhere in the world have all been materially less productive than ordinary varieties. Prom a per - formance standpoint one can only tell what lines should be crossed together for superior performance by actual testing of the hybrid progeny Naturally the larger the number of hybrids tested the greater is the likelihood of a discovery of superior combinations. Some hy - brids may be decidedly inferior to the standard farm varieties and others may excell in all particulars. It is not uncommon for the bet - ter combinations to yield 15 to 20 per cent more than the best farm varieties. Likewise, the more inbred lines one undertakes to develop the more likelihood is there of procuring a number which surpass when used in hybrid combination. Perhaps 200 plants of each of 5 varieties are inbred the first year, making 1,000 plants in all. These are planted the following year, one ear to a row, making 1,000 short rows containing perhaps 30 plants each. Just how the work is to be continued from here on </seg>
            <seg id="p194">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF ACiKICUI.TUUE may vary according to personal preferences and facilities. The simp - lest plan Is to Inbreed several of the choicest, most vigorous, and least defective appearing plants in each row. The best appearing of these is continued each year thereafter, in an ear to row plat by the same selection and inbreeding process. After two or three years of inbreeding the least desirable appearing lines may gradually be dropped, retaining only as large a number as the individual program may seem to justify. Perhaps 10 per cent of the original number will be retained for possible testing In hybrid combination after the fifth year. Preliminary Work That of the Specially Because of the tremendous detail involved in such a corn breed - ing program, the experimental work has to date been largely left to the Experiment Stations of the various states and the U. S. Depart - ment of Agriculture.

First generation single crosses between the Hogue selfed-IInes shown In Fig. 1. The better hybrids normally average 100 to 200 per cent more grain than the selfed parents and 10 to 20 per cent more than the original commercial variety. First generation single crosses are usually very uniform with respect to plant and ear char - acters. Double crossed, seed Is produced by crossing one of those single crosses with an - other single cross nr with a selfed line. </seg>

Just what might be expected from most of these commercial hybrids it has been impossible to predict for, up to the present time, some of the commercial growers have sold a different combination each year without a pervious op - portunity for testing. It appears likely that these commercial hybrids will come to be characterized with greater stability of constitution and known performance. A number of the best planned breeding programs at several State Experiment Stations, many of them in cooperation with U. S. De - partment of Agriculture, have sought to produce an initial thousand or more selfed lines. These were gradually reduced In number re - taining only the more desirable appearing lines for hybridization. It is fortunate if such an initial thousand materializes 20 really choice lines.

The commercial planting of single or double crosses should be restricted 10 nrst generation seed. The nrst step is to select several high grade varieties of corn for inbreeding. These varieties should be known to possess such characteristics as fit them especially for the conditions under which the ultimate hybrids are to be grown. These are planted in a breed - ing plat which is conveniently located for the detailed work to follow. </seg>
            <seg id="p196">IlKI-OKT OK NKISRASKA STATE HOARD OV AGRICULTURE During this inbreeding and elimination period desirable ear and grain characters, as well as vegetative characters, should be carefully considered. After about the fifth year hybridization may begin by combining the most promising of the selfed lines into single crosses. These may be tested the following year in thoroughgoing yield tests or they ma&gt; be grown in mere observation tests in order to eliminate those hybrids whose undtness is self-evident from a mere inspection. The more attractive hybrids are then tested thoroughly in future years. The inbred lines used in these hybrids seldom exceed about one - half the grain yield of the original parent varieties. The best hybrids between them, on the other hand, should yield materially more than the parent variety. It is only the crop immediately following the cross that so much increased yield may be expected. This is known .is the first generation crop. The second generation seed of these single crosses usually does not yield more than about 2/3 as much :is the first generation seed anil therefore cannot be used in com - mercial grain production. Since the first generation single crossed seed is borne on the com - paratively small low yielding inbred plants, and the seed itself is commonly much reduced in size, the use of double crossed seed is much more commonly recommended for commercial planting. Double crossed seed Is produced by crossing together two single crosses; this plan may be modified by using a single cross as the female and an inbred as the male parent. If well combined, such a double cross may yield as well as the single cross parents. Usually extensive trials are necessary to determine what single crosses combine to best ad - vantage. Just crossing "any old things" together does not necessarily lead to productive hybrids. Details of tlie Breeding Program During all this experimental stage the breeding work is done by control pollination, using the bagging method. The young ear shoot is covered by a paper bag before the silks appear. This excludes undeslred pollen. When the silks appear, a bag containing pollen from the desired parent plant replaces the one first put over the ear shoot. This insures the specific inbreeding or hybridization which ever the case may.be. After it has been established thru seed produced by this control pollination method which are the promising hybrids, for commercial use, then these may be made In a far simpler and Inexpensive man - ner. The commercial method of hybrid seed production consists of planting the two parent seed stocks In alternating plats In a natural crossing field, in which one parent is detasseled before shedding any pollen. Its ears are therefore pollinated by the parent whose tassels are not removed. The hybrid seed is picked from the detasseled rows. </seg>
            <seg id="p197">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION It is this seed which produces so well when planted the following year. For farm planting It is desirable that this first generation seed only be used. It is absolutely essential that the selfed line or hybrid used as the female parent be thoroughly detasseled, otherwise the yield of the succeeding crop may be .proportionately reduced. I In this natural crossing field it is advisable to alternate female plats con - taining two or three rows with one row male plats. This will usually insure satisfactory pollination and result in a maximum amount of hybrid seed per acre. Provision must of course be made for maintaining a pure seed supply of the inbred lines used in both of the single crosses which are needed annually for making the double crossed seed. Because of this long drawn out and exacting program it seems most practical that all of this preliminary work be left to the spec - ialist. When it has once been determined what seed stocks are re - quired to make the commercial double crossed seed, then these seed stocks can be made available to the grower who would conduct his own natural crossing plat. To a considerable extent it appears likely that community seed growing specialists will be depended upon to produce a supply of hybrid seed. Yield Tests of Hybrid and Farm Varieties The possibilities of the new corn breeding method and its present status will be more fully appreciated by a study of a number nf Ne - braska yield comparisons, in which the hybrids are contrasted with Btandard farm varieties. The tests reported are for hybrids and standard varieties which have been grown at the Nebraska Experiment Station and in outlying tests on two or more Nebraska farms, during the last three years in cooperation with the Agricultural Extension Service. The assistance of the farm operators where these outlying tests have been made is acknowledged. An effort has been made to assemble the commercial hybrids that were offered for sale in the corn belt, and also additional representa - tive hybrids from various states which were believed to offer promise for our conditions. Low yields of any of the introduced hybrids in no way discredits their originators who have merely supplied the seed at our request, and whose cooperation is greatly- appreciated. In this way it is possible for us to keep posted as to the local possibilities of hybrids produced elsewhere. It Is just as essential that hybrids be adapted where planted as is the case of ordinary corn varieties. The results of the three years tests follow the tables 1 to 3. The comparisons were made in duplicate two or three row plats. The corn was planted by hand at a double rate and thinned to a uni - form stand of three plants per hill. The yields are based on air dry shelled corn. Due to a shortage of seed supply it has not been possible to include all of the hybrids in all of the tests. </seg>

            <seg id="p202">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Results in 1027 None of the hybrids included in the 1927 experiments are now being grown commercially. The six best hybrids averaged 9 per cent more than the six standard varieties at Bennlngton; 6 per cent more at Papilllon, and 16 per cent more at Lincoln. Results In 1028 In 1928 the seven best hybrids averaged 15 per cent better than the seven commercial varieties, at Valley and 12 per cent better at Papilllon. Conditions in the Lincoln test turned out to be rather un - favorable for corn. This field was not' planted until June 26 which proved a serious handicap, under the moisture shortage which fol - lowed. The seven best hybrids surpassed the 3 commercial varieties by 114 per cent. Results In 1020 ■ The highly favorable results with hybrids during the last year suggest that progress is being made in the development of desirable combinations. Comparing the five best hybrids with the five best commercial varieties in each locality the percentage superiority of the hybrid yields were 21. 12. 16. and 17 per cent at Elk City, Papil - llon, Shelton, and Lincoln, respectively. The Finishing Touches •. It is evident from the results secured during the last three years and reported in tables 1 to 3, that we have not yet reached the point where we can definitely state just what may be expected from any particular hybrid. Further testing should establish the relative merits of the most promising hybrids so far tried and additional ones to be made. If some of these continue to perform as they have in the past, especially in 1929, they will prove irresistable and their general adoption will not be long delayed in those sections' where they have proved adapted. More extensive outlying tests In cooperation between farmers, the Agricultural Extension Service, and the Experiment Sta - tion, are being planned for 1930. Efforts are being made to develop suitable hybrids for all portions of Nebraska and this is quite an un - dertaking in view of the widely divergent conditions In this state. Approximately 200 hybrids have been made by this Station for testing in 1930. Now that the principles of procedure have been fairly well established, more attention is being given to the commercial aspects of the new corn breeding program and it seems not far distant until highly desirable hybrids are available and can be recommended for commercial corn production in this state. They should add both to the profit and pleasure of corn growing. </seg>
            <seg id="p203">• NEBRASKA CHOP CROWERS 1 ASSOCIATION In closing, I may restate that for the immediate present conser - vatism may well be recommended. The commercialization of corn hybrids is in its infancy. Opportunity has not yet afforded to es - tablish fully the merits of any particular hybrid over a period of years For that reason, the Nebraska Experiment Station cannot un - qualifiedly recommend them for Nebraska conditions. There is great promise in the best of these hybrids— sufficient so that some of you will wish to try them out on a small scale. In the meantime, the Experiment Station will continue to investigate the dependability for our conditions of hybrids produced elsewhere, and also strive to over - come certain weaknesses of our own productive Nebraska hybrids. i ■-■;■■' MY EXPERIENCE WITH HYB1UI) COKN E. E. McARDLE, Elk City i»Iy experience has only been on 7 or 8 acres of hybrid corn i^rown during one year. • After seeing the result of the experiment of Mr. Gilmore'ij last year I thought it would be well worth while. I sent for a bushel of Funk No. 517 and planted it on ground which had sweet clover last year. I had about 40 acres in this field and merely grew the 517 In comparison with cattle corn. It was a good chance to see what could be done. [ I didn't notice a great deal of difference until about the time we had quite a wind storm one Saturday night. The next day we noticed 517 standing perfectly— the Cattle corn leaning considerably I noticed very little difference then until the ears were set. The ears on 517 were very even and the right distance from the ground. It looked like a person had strung a string down the row and had then hung theears on the stalks, they were just that even. I had quite a bit of corn to husk and when I started I noticed the 517 to be drier than Cattle corn although we considered the Cattle corn quite well matured. One fellow husked 130 bushels the 'first day. The corn was just right from the corn picker's standpoint I noticed the corn wasn't as high as in the Cattle corn and practically every ear was perfect. This corn . made just by weight about 73 bushel against 72 of Cattle corn, averaging 2.2 stalks to hill which was enough for that soil. </seg>
            <seg id="p204">REPORT OK NEBRASKA STATE UOARD OK AGRICULTURE! DISCUSSION OF HYItKll) CORN AMOS K. GRAMLICH, Papillion, Nebraska When I was in school I studied Animal Husbandry, and did not. Ket much interested in corn until I went back to the farm. It was then that I found that there was as much money in raising well bred corn as in raising well bred hogs. In school I had heard of hybrid corn, but did not wake up to the possibilities of its commercial appli - cation until later. This is the third year that hybrid corn lias been grown on our farm near I'apillion, with satisfactory results. However, 1 feel that growing large acreages of it is following rather closely on the heels of experimental work. We are compelled to rely entirely on the hon - esty of the producers of such seed. Some of the men who offer hybrid seed for sale might well spend a few more years in experi - mentation before offering their product to the public. Others have combined good inbreds properly, and have a seed that will yield higher, as well as being superior in other ways to any of the open pollinated strains. ■ . . • ' ■ f - Hybrid Corn on a Kield Scnle The first year I bought sufficient seed to plant ten acres of hybrid, and planted it adjacent to ten acres of our own Rieds Yel - low Dent. At shucking time the corn was run over the scales, and a difference of five bushels per acre was found in favor of the Hybrid. The Hybrid was of better quality, shucked easier, and stood up bet - ter. It was sold to a sheep feeder as soon as shucked, and he was well pleased with the results from it because of the low moisture con - lent, and its similarity to old corn. The next year I planted 40 acres to hybrid, securing the. seed from Wallace and Newlln of Iowa. Through the center of the field were twelve rows- planted to our own corn, to serve as checks on the yield. Both kinds of corn grew rank and the check could be found only by the "markers. Fall winds blew both badly, and they were so tangled that it was hard to pick the checks and be fair with the result, but I felt satisfied with the results obtained in the smaller experimental plats conducted in cooperation with the College of Agri - culture. Here the Hybrid was much superior to our own- corn. I might add that Mr. Ncwlin was at pur farm in the fall and was at a loss to explain why his corn had grown so tall, as in Iowa it had only a medium length stalk. . . I was so well pleased with my own results with hybrid corn, and the high yields and standing ability obtained other places, that last year I planted TOO acres to two different kinds, and with some interesting results. </seg>
            <seg id="p205">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION Forty acres were planted to Newlin No. 281, and this fall yielded 66 bushels to the acre. This was very good, in consideration that it was th| third year in corn, and that ten acres of it was very poor ground. This was probably ten bushels more per acre than our own corn wduld have yielded. The second piece, of sixty acres was planted to an Illinois hybrid, and made about fifty-seven bushels per acre, which was about the same as our own corn would have done, and with greater seed cost per acre. This year all of the corn was listed and stood up well so that a mechanical picker could have been 1 used to advantage. Mr. Honor Ochsner, of hog fame, had some of both kinds up in Madison County, and his results were opposite, that is - his Illinois corn out-yielded the Iowa. • Also I had a neighbor who lives one mile from me, who grew both kinds of corn, and while the Newlin was the beat, there was not so much difference as in my fields The cause of these differences is hard to explain— it might be fer - tility, time of planting, depth of plowing, or a combination of sev - eral factors. Fertility is a big factor of which we must not lose sight There are still men who think that 'Hogs is hogs, and corn is corn, and that's that. There is a difference In hogs and there is a difference in corn Our problem is to find the strain of corn that will yield the most under the conditions of our individual farms, and we must keep in mind that conditions vary with every farm. We can expect an increase in yield from hybrid corn, and also a stalk that will stand up better. With us that is a big item, as our corn grows very tall, and then tangles up so that it is hard to pick by hand, and almost impossible with a picker. This year I had all hybrid corn, and it stood up well, especially the Illinois. Other ad - vantages we might expect are: ability to withstand cold springs' and early frosts in the fall, drouths through the summer, to resist cer - tain insect pests, as corn root worm, and possibly increased palati- Idlity. Palatibility is a new problem in corn, and one that will need more attention in the future. Two | years ago my hybrid was on the flinty order, and really needed grinding to be utilized well in feeding, but this year the kernel seems to be about the same texture as "Reids. Perhaps the 'corn breeders can cross the corn plant with cockle burs and sugar cane to make the kernels sweet and palatable and the stalk so disagree - able that even the corn borer would refuse them. The eastern corn belt farmers would welcome this inovation. even though the stalks would be unfit for roughage. Under the present system of borer devastation they have no stalks to feed anyway. I .would like to see more farmers plant small acreages of hybrid Fifteen dollars a bushel seems like a steep price for seed corn but the cost per acre for seed is only two dollars more, which is little more than it costs to sow an acre of small grain in our community— </seg>
            <seg id="p206">REPORT OK NEBRASKA STATE UOARU OK AGRICULTURE ■ and the corn will yield twice the cash return per acre. Even an in - crease of two or three bushels per acre will pay for the difference, and you may discover something that will be of value. If you ex - periment with several different kinds of corn, and find that, some of your local open pollinated strains are superior, then you certainly have paid for your trouble. If you find that hybrid is better than your local corn, why should you pick, store, shell and grade your own corn when you can get better corn in a sack ready for the planter box? The question of hybrid corn is a big one. Progressive farmers are awake and watching and as usual will be the first to experiment and then to adopt it permanently. I thank you. QUESTION: Can you pick seed from your hybrid corn? ANSWER: No. You must buy it every year. It will tend to revert back to ears like the inbreds which are small and scrubby. QUESTION: Do you think it a good policy to list every year? ANSWER: I do not like to list ground continuously but it helps to divide the labor at planting and cultivating time. Plowing and f.hen using the loose ground lister overcomes the objection to con - stant listing. QUESTION: Don't you think corn should be rotated every two or three years? ANSWER: Three years should be the limit because of fertility and insect pests. ' HOME PROBLEMS IN GROWING ROUGHAGE IN NEBRASKA P. H. STEWART, Extension Agronomist In discussing the problems connected with the growing of Rough - age In Nebraska, roughage will be interpreted to mean hay and fod - der of all kinds. Pastures will not be considered. First, let us take a look at the annual roughage crop of Ne - braska to get some idea of its size and importance. Suppose we mea - sure it first in acres. According to statistics, roughage crops in 1928 occupied 4,669,009 acres of the state or about one million more acres than we have in winter wheat. . In dollars and cents our annual roughage crop is worth about $55,000,000 which is practically equal to the value of an annual wheat crop. Roughage crops occupy about 25 per cent of all of the cultivated land of the state. Corn, for comparison, occupies almost twice that per cent. </seg>
            <seg id="p207">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS" ASSOCIATION Suppose we try to visuali/.u our roughage crop from another standpoint. Most of you have handled a pitchfork and know how it feels to work behind a hay stacker on a hot summer day. Imagine yourself on top of Nebraska's roughage stack If all of it were to be stacked- in one huge pile. The stack when finished would be one mile long, a quarter of a mile wide and 460 feet high, which would be' some 30 feet higher than the highest point of the new capitol tower. Here indeed would be a stack that is a stack. And every year the livestock men of Nebraska pitch most of this to their cattle, sheep, horses and hogs. Table 1 gives some statistical data on roughage crops.

We have heard a good deal said lately about the reduction in alfalfa acreage in Nebraska and in other states, particu - larly Kansas. It has been said that Nebraska's acreage is being rapid - ly reduced and that livestock men might well begin to look for some other feed to replace alfalfa. Just what is the situation as to alfalfa in Nebraska and what" are the factors involved in the change of acreage. To begin with let us consider the alfalfa acreage in Nebraska for the past 10 years. Table II gives these figures from the state statistician. </seg>

Duo to winterkilling the 1917 acreage was low - being in fact 12,000 acres lower than during the past season of 1929 The highest acreage that we have ever had, 1,300,000 acres, was in 1925. There has been considerable yearly fluctuation which makes annual comparisons difficult. Suppose 1917 Is dropped out due to the winter killing situation and the remaining 12 years be divided into 5 groups of 4 years each. As shown in Table II there is no great difference in the acreage of the 3 divisions but the 1922-1925 period leads. ■ ; Table II — Alfalfa Acreage in Nebraska Year Acres Acreage by groups of years "17 1,082,919 ! 1918 1,165,000 .

Is there some reason for this and in what part of Ne - braska is the loss of acreage the greatest? We feel quite sure that one factor in the killing out of alfalfa the use ot unhardy seed. Records show that large amounts of unhardy alfalfa from foreign countries such as Argentine, Africa Italy and Spain, were imported into the United States. Much of this seed found Its way to Nebraska farms, particularly in eastern Ne - braska where there is normally no home grown alfalfa seed. Then too, we know that thousands of pounds of alfalfa seed from south - western states has been sold in Nebraska. Many tests have shown t:,tji cSz^ dine8B of such seed fr6m Arizona ' New Mexic °- By and large, we feel sure that the use of unhardy seed caused large and premature losses of stands of alfalfa in eastern Nebraska and In the great alfalfa district of the Platte Valley </seg>
            <seg id="p209">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION Correlated with the use of much unhardy seed was a new alfalfa disease called alfalfa wilt. This, has also caused losses, particularly where unhardy seed was used and in the river valley fields. We do not yet know just how important alfalfa wilt will continue to be as a disease in reducing alfalfa stands. On the whole, however, by using good hardy alfalfa seed we be - lieve that much of the trouble in losing stands prematurely can be avoided in the future. For average conditions we recommend the use of common alfalfa from sections having at least as severe climatic conditions as our own. For certified seed production and for par - ticularly adverse conditions we suggest the use of Grimm or Cossack.

In buying alfalfa seed care should be taken to get truly northern seed. Fortunately this year we have an abundance of Nebraska grown seed which will sell at a reasonable price. Such seed is excellent. Those who buy on the open market should specify "verified seed" which has been checked by the U. S. D. A. as to the state in which the seed was grown and the tag on the sack carries this information. We have in Nebraska this year some certified Grimm and some hardy approved common alfalfa inspected by the Nebraska Crop Grow - ers' Association. Anyone interested in these should get a seed Hat from the Association. The certified Grimm traces to the Carver county, Minnesota, original fields and has been field inspected and sealed. Nebraska hardy approved common alfalfa comes from fields at least 8 years old and still a good stand. This is good seed of common alfalfa, for the particular farmer.

            <seg id="p210">REPORT OK NEBRASKA STATE UOARD OF AGRICULTURE land fields failed to make any where near as much hay as the first seeding on such land. What is the reason for this, has been the common question. Does the soil lack fertility such as phosphorus or potash? Is there a shortage of lime following several years of crop - ping to a heavy lime user such as alfalfa? Or is the trouble one of subsoil moisture? The Agronomy department of the Nebraska Agricultural College has for several years been working on this problem. It seems to be largely a matter of subsoil moisture. On the uplands of Nebraska we grow our large alfalfa crops on seasonal rain plus subsoil moisture. At the Experiment Station at Lincoln, as reported by Profs. Klessel - bach, Russel, and Anderson, a new alfalfa field made its greatest yield the third year yielding 7.2 tons of cured hay per acre. During the fifth and sixth years the yield was only 2.0 tons even though the stand of alfalfa was good. It is estimated that the 7.2 ton yield would re - quire 4G inches of transpirational water for the season. The actual rainfall of the Lincoln area during this period was about 27 inches. The subsoil supplied the balance which during the six year period amounted to nearly 33 inches. Soil samples showed that alfalfa drew water from as deep as 33 feet in a 6 year old meadow. It is therefore logical to believe that the low yields of alfalfa seeded back in old alfalfa land on upland soils is due to a shortage of subsoil moisture. A further study of . the replacement of this subsoil moisture under Lincoln rainfall conditions shows that it is extremely slow. Nebraska Experiment Station workers estimate that for this particular field studied at Lincoln it will take 225 years to restore the subsoil water to its original content. Now what is the practical lesson from these facts? Shall we stop growing alfalfa? I think not. Alfalfa is the only crop in our rotation which is able to use this subsoil moisture, so why not make v.se of it? Other crops feed largely in the upper 6 feet. We may as well cash in on the deep subsoil moisture, writing our check on an alfalfa blank which is the only one which the keeper of the subsoil moisture treasure will honor. The subsoil moisture is drawing no interest. We may as well draw It out, invested in alfalfa hay which is of cash value. The lesson however, is this. Do not plant alfalfa a second time on an upland field which was in alfalfa for a consider - able period and expect to get the yields which the first seeding made. Put it on land which has never been in alfalfa. But, someone will say, what will we do when we have covered the farm with alfalfa. Few farms are in that condition today, nor will they be for a considerable period. When the time comes to put alfalfa back on old alfalfa land we may expect about 2 tons per acre with a 28-30 inch rainfall. The question to answer, when that time comes, is — can we afford to put upland fields into alfalfa for a 2 ton yield? </seg>
            <seg id="p211">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION Some Seeding Problems Is there a possibility that our Nebraska soils may need lime? is another question often asked by the farmer who has had difficulty in getting satisfactory stands of sweet clover, alfalfa or red clover. In certain parts of Nebraska and under certain conditions there is a strong possibility that lime would help to get sweet clover, alfalfa, and even red clover started. A lack of lime is most likely to affect legume crops. Sweet clover is the most sensative to a sour soil, alfalfa is next, followed by red clover and then soybeans. It is a common observation that sweet clover starts best on clayey hillsides and is hardest to start on alluvial bottom-lands or even more so on level uplands where the soil has been farmed for many years. The amount of lime in the soil is the reason for this difference in the behavior of the sweet clover. On the hillsides lime is exposed in the subsoil by erosion. On the level lands which have long been under the plow the lime in the surface soil has leached into the subsoil. Lime may also be of considerable benefit on the glacial soils of southeastern Nebraska. In tests in which 5 carloads of limestone were used on farms considerable benefit was secured in morei than 50 per cent of the trials. It was formerly believed that one could make laboratory tests of the soils from a certain field or farm and determine whether or not lime would be of benefit to legumes. It was found however In these tests that there was no laboratory test which indicated what one might actually get in field tests. It is therefore suggested that where one has fields suspected of being low in lime, that an actual test be made using 2 tons of 'lime - stone per acre and applying this a year In advance if possible to the seeding of sweet clover or alfalfa. Sometimes it is difficult to secure stands of alfalfa and the clovers on thin run-down soils. This may be due to low fertility. Experience has shown that manure applied to such fields in advance of seeding will help materially to secure satisfactory stands and a good growth. Sweet Clover for Hay I j .;■;.;, . In eastern Nebraska it is now a very common practice to seed sweet clover with small grain, cutting a crop of sweet clover hay from the field in the fall. First year sweet clover hay makes excel - lent feed, being very similar to alfalfa in composition. The high protein content, as is the case with alfalfa. Is in the sweet clover leaves which makes it essential to save as many leaves as possible in making hay. Most of the farmers of eastern Nebraska who use first year sweet clover for hay also value the crop as a soil builder. Many follow the practice of plowing the second year crop under in early May, </seg>

It has been shown that first year sweet clover makes most of Its first years growth in the late fall months. Unless allowed to make a good fall growth its second year develop - ment during April and May is very much less than it would be were it not cut for hay in the fall of its first year. Ohio has shown for instance, that sweet clover cut early in the fall of its first year had only 70 pounds of nitrogen per acre compared to 125 pounds tor fields not cut for hay the previous fall. It is good practice therefore, to allow the first year sweet clover to stand uncut until as late in the fall as weather will permit, as it Is at this time that the root system is being filled with food reserves which bring on an early and strong growth the following spring. In this way one would get the greatest tonnage of hay and also the greatest soil benefit by May 10th of the next year. It would also be good practice to let sweet clover make a good growth before pas - turing it in the fall. There seems to be little if any danger in feeding first year sweet clover hay. Second year sweet clover hay may cause losses in cattle If fed over long periods. .■ ■. - 1 Sudan Grass and Cane So far as yields of forage are concerned, cane will normally yield some 30 per cent more than Sudan grass. Sudan, however, has the advantage that it can be used for either bay or pasture as the need may be. Neither crop is high in protein ranging from 5 to 6 per cent crude protein when cut at the usual time. Neither sudan or cane are very palatable and both are rather difficult to cure. As roughage crops, however, they are valuable, particularly in the drier parts of the state where they stand drought well, and on farms where legume crops are not available. Sudan is an especially good crop for summer pasture, being an outstanding dry season crop: A greater acreage of sudan would seem to be justified as a supplementary summer pasture when permanent pasture lands are at low ebb. Many renters could use sudan grass more extensively. Where sudan Is used for pasture it seems desirable to get pure seed which has not crossed with cane as mixed seed might produce forage more likely to contain prussic acid, common in cane grown under certain conditions. Fodder and Silage Corn Tests at the Nebraska Experiment Station show the freatest tonnage of corn silage is produced when the crop was planted at the rate of 4 plants per hill. Planting at the rate of 3 plan ts per hill made the greatest grain yield. For the greatest feed value produced </seg>

LEWIS, Nebraska Agricultural College In order that everyone may have a common understanding of the subject under discussion it Is the usual procedure to give defini - tions. Under that procedure, I should now start with definitions of both roughage and grinders. However, Mr. Stewart and Mr. Mc- Campbell are the authorities on roughages; and I wish to follow the lawyer's lead in always having a loophole, so I am going to dispense with definitions or explanation. I am not going to attempt to tell you anything of the benefits of ground feeds but -I want to give you a chance to think with me or argue with me on the mechanics of grinding, the cost of grinding, and a mechanical analysis of the product we get when we have ''ground feed." Many of the feeding tests from the various experiment! sta - tions have compared ground feeds and have necessarily assumed the cost of grinding or charged custom mill prices. Usually very | little was said in the reports of these tests about how fine the feed was ground or the quality of the grinding, etc. A few years ago, circumstances, if we may borrow a term, forced the American Society of Agricultural Engineers to begin definite studies on costs of grinding these feeds. Shortly all kinds of! data appeared on costs, very few of which were comparable. This array of figures on costs of grinding feeds forced this same body of Agricultural Engineers to establish or recommend a standard by which grinding could be measured. The object of this standard was to compare, as well as designate, results. The basis of this standard is fineness. Being engineers, it is natural that an engineering term should enter into their recommendations and the term fineness modulus ap - pears. This term has been used some years In building materials specifications and among engineers is a common term. Because it is comparatively new among feeders and feed men, I want to take away the mysterlousnesa of this term that is being used more and more in recent talks and articles on ground feeds. </seg>
            <seg id="p216">REPOKT OK NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF. AGRICULTURE^ To shorten this part of my harangue. I have here a set of stand - ard Tyler sieves by which we separate the particles of a ground feed. There are seven of these sieves as recommended. The opening in the coarsest one is 3/8" and the opening in the finest screen is so small that there are 10,000 to the square inch. This separation is by mech - anical means in which a shaking and a rotary motion are combined on a machine called a Ro tap. To show you now what the analysis of feeds by this method brings out, I have an assortment of bottles holding samples of the particles as retained on the screens I have just shown you. Before anyone gets suspicious or hurt in the rush, I want to warn you that the corn In these bottles is "very dry," having been oven dried to constant weight and therefore minus practically all the liquid. With these exhibits (borrowing another lawyer term) we can now talk about grinders and illustrate what we are talking about. What Type of Grinder Is Best The questions that come to many of us are: what type of grinder, v/hat to grind, how fine to grind, or what qualities the ground feed should have, and not the least, of course, is cost of grinding. Recently when someone writes to the Agricultural College asking what type of grinder to buy, he wishes us to' tell him whether he Phall purchase a hammer mill 'or a burr .grinder. Usually there is nothing in the query of an explanatory nature indicating what the writer wants to grind, what livestock he wants to prepare the ground feed for, nor in what condition he wants this ground feed. Usually we are forced to answer such an inquiry by saying, "if this or that condition is true, it he wants to feed such and such livestock and if he wants to grind certain named feeds and has this or that power he can expect about these results from these named types of grinders." Then we have to seek that lawyer loophole again and supplement some of our "ifs" and "ands" by saying that one should be sure the dealer and manufacturer are ready to give him quick and efficient service when he needs it. Isn't that a rather disgusting and unsatisfactory kind of way to answer so definite a question as "what type of grinder shall I buy?" It most assuredly is. Hammer vs. Burr Mills In general, we usually feel that we can say that the hammer mill is slightly better adapted to automatic grinding because there is less danger of. serious breakage from iron or other hard foregn sub - stances that may be in the feed and because of the fact that when a hammer mill runs empty there is not the wear and tear that is found when burrs are allowed to operate with no grain between them; where Sine powdery particles of grain are objectionable, the burr mill allows </seg>

I expect many of you are feeling that too much emphasis is being placed on this fine flour like material as an extra point against the hammer mill.

We hear a great amount of talk that this grinder is much more efficient and does a much better, much finer job of grinding. Who sets that standard? Are you feeders doing it or are you doing the best you can with what is offered you or what you can buy at the best terms and get in a hurry? Are you buying grinders like some folks Bell patent medicine; as a cure all? Maybe those questions sound pessimistic or sarcastic. That is not the intention. Many manufact - urers are finding that their grinders are being sold by ambitious salesmen to process any. feed the farmer wants and the way he wants it. Sometimes these manufacturers go to a farm on a day when the farmer is trying to grind some kind of feed for which the grinder was not intended. The result is a vast amount of talk, some ruffled feelings, some "passing the buck" and quite often the decision to stop trying to grind this particular feed. Possibly this last decision is wise in that the cost of grinding may have been greater than the benefits derived from feeding ground feed rather than whole feeds. But in these cases the feeder or farmer has bought something. His money is invested. Why not use the equipment? Our expert feeders show that there is seldom very great benefit to be derived from grinding many feeds fed to many classes of livestock. Records show that there are close to 10,000 grinders in Ne - braska. One-third of this number were probably sold as roughage grinders. With the investment this represents plus the cost of power and labor to operate these machines staring us In the face, there is justification for plenty of study of grinders. We have jumped around in trying to show that it is not easy to say what type of grinder to purchase. We are not advocating that you buy any grinder at all, but if you feel you must add the grinder as further equipment we feel we can give some Information for or against either of the most common types. Even if you have the power for other purposes, you must have use of the equivalent of 400 to 500 bushels of grain per year before you can afford to grind your own feed. You can hire it done cheaper. Fineness of Grinding If you do grind your own grain, what fineness do you get the best results from? Do you know? Or do you estimate? Oats may be called roughage by hog men. How shall we grind them? Some Indiana experiments show that medium ground oats give better results than the finely ground oats for hog feeding gains. But take these samples I have on exhibition. The fine ground costs between 4 and 5 times as much to grind as these medium ground oats. The cost of cracking corn in about 4 pieces, as many of our feeders like to do, costs less than </seg>
            <seg id="p219">Nebraska crop growers- association ■ I 1/3 as much as some of the finely ground corn we see on other farms. Which feeder is getting the most out of his bushel or his acre, over and above his costs? We see many places where farmers and feeders are trying to grind corn fodder and similar roughages. This fall this has been a very discouraging process and if the cost is counted it has also been useless. There has been too much moisture, the grinders have clogged and the air becomes blue. Here is a place where the hammer mill falls down. It is not made for this kind of grinding, the feed heats up to around 200° Fahr. and unless it is fed shortly the feed becomes moldy. The men with fodders have in many cases found that chopping or recutting accomplishes almost as good results as grinding these fodders and the cost is reduced at least 1/3. We have had many complaints come to us of lost weight when the feed has been ground with the hammer mill. We have run many tests to determine this and have found that this complaint may have some justification. Quite often from) 3 to fi% of weight is lost, especially from the high speed hammer mills not so well installed. Some of this lost is from moisture, some from dust and probably some feed. I '-.■-. ' ■ i , , I • . — ' "THE MOST MEAT PEK ACRE" Figuring Livestock Feeding Profits — Per Head or Per Acre C. W. McCAMPBELL In general livestock feeders can be grouped into two classes (1) Farmer feeders and (2) Commercial feeders. In this discussion a farmer feeder is one who feeds the crops he produces on the farm where they are grown, to livestock he raises or buys. A commercial feeder is one who buys both feed and the livestock to which he feeds it. At first thought it might seem that the problems of each are the same but such is not the case. The farmer feeder is the one in which I am most concerned in this discussion today. . A commercial feeders possible profits must begin where the farm feeders profits may already be made. Commercial feeding is more speculative. It offers little opportunity to convert into income the Incidentals of farmer feeding, such as, meadow aftermath, stockfields, unmarketable roughages, manure, idle labor, etc. The spirit of spec - ulation in commercial feeding has to a large extent determined the type and kind of livestock this group has been feeding. In the case of cattle this group has in the -main chosen the kind that may but </seg>
            <seg id="p220">REPORT OK NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OK ACiRICULTURE seldom make big profits, — the big steer; and have refused to recog - nize the fact that the possibilities for a big loss with this same kind of cattle are just as great and more certain. Commercial feeders are usually prominent individuals. Many of them have lost money in recent years. Their prominence has re - sulted in wide publicity for their misfortunes. This has created a more or less general feeling that livestock feeding under all cir - cumstances is an unstable and an unprofitable phase of agriculture. Unfortunately many farmer feeders have been influenced by the prom - inence of commercial feeders and have followed their practices both as to type of cattle selected and method of. feeding when as a matter ot fact neither was in keeping with demands of the situation con - fronting the farmer feeder. The rarmer feeders chief Interest in meat producing animals should be their ability to furnish a market for his crops. This being true the only sound method for the farmer feeder to use in figuring his cattle feeding profits is the bushel or ton, or better still the acre return or income. In this connection it should be emphasized that the commercial feeder must figure his returns or Income upon the basis of margin between feed cattle and labor costs on the one hand and cattle receipts on the other. Paradoxical as It may seem at first thought a farmer feeder may lose money figuring his operation on a commercial feeding basis and still make money on his feeding op - erations. This fact has come home in a very forcible manner to many farmer feeders who have checked this matter carefully. Let one instance suffice to illustrate this point. A farmer feeder of my acquaintance compared notes with a nearby commercial feeder and figured his cattle feeding operations on the same basis the com - mercial feeder was forced to use. The farmer feeder found that he would have made a profit of only 7 cents per head — not a very profit - able commercial enterprise. However, when he made a careful check of the incidentals that he was able to turn into income and then figured his return upon the basis of the major crop sold to the cattle which was corn, he found the cattle in question had paid him 12 cents a bushel more than the elevator would have paid him, or a total of $480 compared to an income of only $7 figured on the basis his commercial feeder friend had to use. At this point It might be well to consider for just a moment the relationship of livestock to farm crop values. The soil is the basis of all agriculture. Out of It grow crops. These crops are valuable In proportion to their usability and demand. During recent years we have been hearing a great deal about factors that determine the value of farm crops but very little about the factor that actually plays a more important part than all "thers combined. Table I relating to this may be of interest. </seg>

This is one of the advantages the farmer feeder possesses. The greatest possible return per bushel or ton and therefore per acre depends upon efficient utilization of feed and market demand for the finished product made from feeds. Fortunately the kind of livestock that produces the most gain for each acre of feed con - sumed is the kind for which there is- the greatest market demand. j This is a fortunate situation for the man who markets his feed thru livestock, but unfortunately many farmer feeders as well as most commercial feeders have not given this matter the consideration the present situation demands. The kind of livestock that will return the most per acre for the feed consumed is the light weight, whether it be cattle, hogs, or sheep. An indication of the possible acre reiurn that the farmer feeders may have secured during the past few years by feeding the kind of cattle that is most in demand and which utilize feed most efficiently | is shown in Table II. </seg>

It is quite significant that each year the cattle paid more than the elevator would have paid and that over a period of 7 years gave a return of nearly 41 cents per bushel more than would have been re - ceived from the elevator. Figured on a 40 bushel per acre yield the elevator return would have. been $32 per acre but the cattle paid $48 per acre, an increase of 50%. These figures applied to your own yields will give you some idea of what your corn land might have returned during recent years had It been fed to the right kind of cattle in combination with the right kind of supplementary feeds. These figures emphasize the fact that finishing cattle of the right type, using the right kind of a ration, and reasonable care and judg - ment in management is a profitable phase of agriculture based upon per bushel or per ton or per acre returns, despite all we have heard about the losses sustained by cattle feeders. Thus far we have been discussing livestock feeding from a fin - ished standpoint only. There is another phase that may be even more satisfactory particularly where grain crop yields are low and that phase is wintering stockers and feeders. We have done considerable work along this line at the Hays branch of our experiment station, which is in the western, part of the state and many farmers have found it possible to secure considerably more return per acre from row crops fed to stockers and feeders than from wheat grown on adjoining land. Table III gives the results of last years work along this line. </seg>

ROACH of Great Western Sugar Co., at Meeting or Organized Agriculture, Scpttsbluff, Nebraska, December 13,. 1929 Plant tissues generally carry from one-half to two and one-half per cent mineral matter, yet in spite of this low mineral content it is the mineral element of nutrition nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus and sometimes calcium that generally limit, crop growth. The full realization of the importance of these mineral elements and their availability is absolutely necessary if we are to thoroughly understand the crop possibilities of any area. For many years it was thought by most soil experts that the soils of the arid west, because of not having been subject to leaching by heavy rainfall, were more plentiful in the mineral elements than were those of the humid. areas. This was further borne out by the fact that a number of early field tests with commercial fertilizers had shown very ordinary results. This all led to a feeling among most agriculturists working with irrigated lands of the Rocky mountain area, that we had no need for commercial fertilizers. There were a few, however, who realized from the chemical analyses of soil samples that the supply of phosphorus was meager and who looked forward to the necessity for its use. Among these few men was Dr. Headden of the Colorado Agricultural College who, over 20 years ago I re - member stating in class. "Our western soils do not yet need commer - cia fertilizers but you boys will live to see it and the first one you will need will be phosphorus." Cases of Phosphate Deficiency For a number of years, I do not know just how many but I can remember my first example in 1920, we had noticed in isolated areas that occasionally we would have a good field of beets up to about July 15 and then a part of the plants would begin to die and probably by fall most of the field would have been lost. When we opened up the Wheatland district this condition was found to be quite a serious matter and our past experience and knowledge did not allow us to properly diagnose it. We usually or often found this condition following close to alfalfa or sweet clover and we knew that a heavv m wh b ?r y ., ard manUre W ° Uld 8eem to cure "• ThIs situation in •he Wheatland territory continued for several years and we were be - coming so concerned that in 1926 we had gotten to the point of starting an experimental plot where we were trying out different cul - tural methods with the hope of finding the cause and method of pre- P«t'.Wl«J JKSStoS rcpo^ WeCt a " d the data '" thi » '»"'• » &lt;• W»« ™«le « </seg>

Nothing worth while or of great interest was learned from the 1926 experiments, but there was in that year an accident which has led to very important results. One of the Wheatland growers, Mr. W. H. Pruitt, had a straw stack in the middle of his Held which he decided to spread over the field and plow under. The straw was distributed from a hay rack by throwing to each side and where the wagon ran there was no straw. After spreading the straw, Mr. Pruitt found that he could not | plow it under because of too much trash, and so he set fire to the wind - rows and burned the straw.

The matter was checked up and it was found that where the straw had been burned the beets were healthy while where no straw was burned the plants, were dying from the disease we had called "black heart." This accident and the observation of its re - eults led to an entirely new line of thought. The only difference be - tween the soil growing the healthy beets and that growing the dis - eased beets was the presence of the ash. from the burned straw, and therefore the cause of the disease must have been the lack of some mineral elements contained in the ash. It was an easy step then </seg>
            <seg id="p226">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 10 try out commercial fertilizers on our experimental plots in 1927 and find that the use of phosphates entirely prevented the disease "black heart" and at the. same time increased the beet yield on these experimental plots by about four tons per acre. The difference on the phosphate treated and untreated plots was so pronounced and became so well known that the growers in the Wheatland district themselves bought enough phosphate in 1928 to treat over 600 acres. These commercially treated fields, together with a number o'f plots for which our Company furnished phosphate, so completely verified the fact of phosphate deficiency in the Wheatland soils that for the 1929 crop 6,300 acres of the 7,300 acres planted to beets were treated with phosphate and their crop this year is remarkably good consid - ering the relatively large increase in acreage which has taken place. Phosphate Studies I feel that the story of our experience at Wheatland makes a background for the consideration of the phosphate problem on the North Platte Valley soils, for it was that experience which led us to give consideration to the same subject in other areas, and particularly in the North Platte Valley territory- The study of the need of phos - phate in this territory has been made in two ways,— first, by soil tests and second, by actual experimental plots. (1) Soil Tests Complete chemical analyses of soils is a very laborious task and after they have been completed it is difficult to say definitely whether or not the particular soil in question will grow satisfactory crops. This Is due to the fact that the question of availability of the neces - sary elements is not indicated by the analyses. For example, the soil may have sufficient total phosphate to produce a good crop and yet this phosphate may be so combined with calcium that it is not avail - able to the growing plants. This inability to conclusively use chemical analyses as a guide for need of commercial fertilizers has caused soil technologists to give considerable study to the determination of methods that would really tell whether or not a particular soil was actually deficient in available mineral elements and out of this study have come two methods which we are now. using. (2) Neubauer Test In the first place the Neubauer test is qualitative insofar as the amount of the element tested for is concerned. Each test consists of growing from 100 to 605 rye plants in 100 grams of soil for 18 to 16 days. During this time all measurable amounts of available potash in the 100 grams of soil are supposed to have been taken up by the plants. The plants are carefully ' removed from the soil at the end of the growing period and all soil washed from the roots. </seg>
            <seg id="p227">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION The entire crop ot plants (roots and all) is then analyzed and the amount of P,O, or K,O in it determined in mg. You see by this that the percent of available P.O. or K,0 on air dried soil can be de- I termlned. The results of the tests are reported in Neubauer values. j The value is simply the number of mg of P 3 O, in the case of a test : for available phosphoric acid and of K S O in the case of a test for available potash actually taken from the soil.. Since the rye itself : contained some P.O. and K,O, all of that recovered from the crop of [ plants was not taken fromthe soil. In order to account for the : amount in the rye another li)0 to 05 rye plants are grown in ster- I llized quartz sand. The individual kernels of rye planted in the sand must be of the same weight as those planted in the soil. The amount of P,O, or K,O recovered in the plants grown in the sand will repre - sent the amount originally in the rye grain less any lost in the grow - ing processes. Therefore, the amount of P,O, or K,O found in the rye grown in the soil less the amount found in the plants grown in sand is the amount actually removed from the soil. This is the Neubauer \alue. Neubauer values from 6 to 8 according to German standards indicate that the soil contains enough available P,O, for all i crops except beets. Our Group 3 in reporting Winogradsky tests corres - ponds to the 6 to 8.9 Neubauer value class. Group 1 corresponds to Neubauer value up to 3.9 and Group 2 to Neubauer values from 4 to 6.9, Group 4 Is all soils with Neubauer values of 9 or over. (3) Wlnegradsky Test This, test is based upon the fact that certain bacteria particularly of the azotobacter (the free living nitrogen gathering bacteria of the soil) require for good growth the same mineral nutrients that plants jneed and if the addition of a mineral nutrient will benefit plant growth it will likewise benefit the bacterial growth. The technic of the test may be about as follows: The sample of soil is divided | Into several portions and to one portion is added some phosphate, to another some potassium and to a third both phosphate and potas - sium, while to the fourth nothing is added, it being used as a check. Each portion of the sample is then Inoculated with the bacteria, food (corn starch) added and all of them placed in an incubator and ob - servation made of the bacterial growth. If there is a deficiency of phosphate or potassium, or both, the bacterial growth on the treated soils will be more pronounced than on the untreated portion and the conclusion can be drawn that if the soil in question is treated with the mineral nutrient shown crop growth will be increased. This is a rapid method which allows a number of soil samples to be readily tested and so far in our check against actual field trials has shown a good agreement. ; ■ . ■ This fall 475 soil samples were taken of North Platte Valley soils but to date only 154 have been analyzed.

            <seg id="p229">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION On helds where beets followed potatoes. The potato crop uses very little phosphate and unquestionably the beet crop following potatoes lias more phosphate available than when following other crops and that fact is partially responsible for the small gains due to the use of phosphate at Mitchell.

Areas Responding to Phosphates The maximum increases in tonnage because of phosphate , appli - cation were as follows: Bayard — 4.41 tons per acre near Piper. Minatare — 3.65 tons per acre near Tony. Scottsbluff — S.27 tons per acre near Covert. Mitchell — 1.02 tons per acre near. Pelton. Gering — 11.10 tons per acre south of Gering (diseased field). Lyman— 5.46 tons per acre east of Lyman. The soil tests and the actual field tests would indicate that there is a real phosphate deficiency in some, of the soils of the North Platte area and this experimental data is- borne out by the observa - tions that we were able to make during the past summer. I saw evi - dence last summer of the phosphate deficiency disease "black heart" In the following widely divided areas: DeGraw. North of Bayard. North and east of Scottsbluff. - Lyman. Mitchell Valley. . Gering cove. </seg>
            <seg id="p230">REPORT OK NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE From what we have been able to learn in connection with soil testa, experimental plots and observations, I would say that our pres - ent knowledge would indicate that the deficiency of phosphate is about in the following order: 1st — Gering cove. 2nd — East of Hayard-McGraw. 3rd — Mitchell Valley and Lyman. 4 th — M in a ta re. 5 th — Scottsbluft. 6th— Mitchell. In the Gering cove there is very little of the best land, excepting possibly some very highly manured farms, that will not benefit by the addition of phosphate. This Is true to a lesser extent of Mitchell Valley, Lyman, east of Bayard, and Minatare, while in the Scottsbluff territory there are many fields that would be benefltted by its use. As yet our experimental plots have not shown much increase in the Mitchell area. As a general proposition we can- expect the greatest benefit to the beet crop from use of phosphate in about the following order: First: to lands which are broken out of alfalfa or sweet clover and for which no manure, or only a limited amount, is available. As stated before we have generally found that the. "black heart" disease li-ore generally follows one of the nitrogen fixing crops. Second: on old ground for which no manure is available. Third: on old ground for which a limited amount of manure is available. Fourth: on old land for which plenty of manure is available. The question of the carry-over value of phosphate and the value of phosphate for other crops are of importance. In 1927 n few strips o? a beet field west of Longmont were treated with phosphate and the next year the field was seeded to wheat. The untreated portion of the field yielded 37 bushels per acre while the treated area yielded 50 huBhels, the carry-over giving an increase of 13 bushels per acre. In 1927 in the Gering territory a part of a beet field was treated with phosphate and that part in 1929 without additional phosphate, yielded 2.3 tons per acre more than the untreated portion. From this we can Justifiably expect that the addition of phosphate will give a con - siderable carry-over benefit to the succeeding crops. As to the ef - tect on other crops, Mr. DeGraw, near the DeGraw beet dump, ob - tained an Increase of 20 bushels per acre on oats while at Fromberg, .Montana, the yield of alfalfa was doubled by the use of phosphate. South of Gering we had an example of a good improvement in alfalfa when a strip was treated with phosphate. I think we can expect phosphate to benefit our grain crops, particularly on heavily manured lands, by increasing the strength of the straw, thereby reducing the tendency to lodge and also by hastening maturity. </seg>
            <seg id="p231">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION Applying Phosphate The question of the kind of phosphate to use, amount per acre, and method of application are all of importance and interest. We are at the present time using what is known as "Treble super phosphate" manufactured by the Anaconda Copper CO. This contains approx - imately 46% I'X), and because of its high phosphate content and the consequently relatively low freight cost, the cost per unit of phosphate is lower than is the case with fertilizers of lower phosphate content. So far in our tests we have used 100 pounds per acre and this past year the phosphate fertilizer was furnished to growers at a price of |2.75 per hundred. There are some indications that in cases of extreme phosphate deficiency it would be advisable to use more phosphate fertilizer, pos - sibly up to 150 pounds per acre. The most satisfactory method of application we have found so far is by means of a combination grain and fertilizer drill. The phosphate is drilled in before the last leveling or floating. The ground is then floated, harrowed and planted. The phosphate should not be. drilled in with the seed or concentrated in seed rows as tests have shown that the germination of the seed is thereby partially destroyed. At the same time It is important to have the phosphate at about the same depth as the seed so that the plants may have the advantage of the fertilizer at an early stage in their development since one of the greatest benefits of phosphate fertilizer Is to prevent the development of diseases such as "black-root" ■ In the beet crop. Since we began our work on the use of phosphates I have heard a number of men make the remark "Commercial fertilizers burn out the soil." What usually happens is that the use of some commercial fertilizer brings about increased yields and the farmers stop using barnyard manure and other organic fertilizers with the result that in a few years the soil suffers from lack of humus and consequent lack of tilth and may be said to be burned out. The use of phosphate will not solve all of our fertility problems. Its addition to soils that need it will make for increased yields provided the organic content and nitrogen content are likewise well maintained. I am personally convinced that there is a real deficiency of phosphate in a great part of the North Platte Valley and that not only the beet crop but other crops as well will be materially benefltted by its use. Our experience in this- respect is only similar to the experience of our friends to the east of us. Recently I, wrote the Agricultural College of several of our eastern states regarding the matter of commercial fertilizers and they all report that they find in many areas a need of phosphate fertiliza - tion. The deficiency of phosphate which is becoming apparent! in our soils is not a serious ma'.ter if its need is fully realized and advantage taken of applications of phosphate through commercial fertilizers. </seg>

GRAIN CERTIFICATION — 1930 1. Requirements for Certification. Applicants for certification must be members of the Nebraska Crop Growers' Association. The membership fee is $1.00 which . entitles one to a copy of the printed annual report of the Associa - tion and other membership privileges. a. Crops Eligible for Certification. Fields of Kanred, Nebraska 60 Winter wheat, Marquis spring wheat, Ceres spring wheat, Nebraska 21 oats, Burt 293 oats, Kanota ( Fulghum ) oats, Trebi barley, Glabron barley. Velvet and Comfort barley, Rosen rye, and flax will be eligible for certifica - tion. After 1930 no fields will be eligible for certification where other varieties of the same crop are grown on the farm. In other words, certified seed growers can grow only one wheat variety, one oats variety, etc., per farm. This is to assist in avoiding mix - tures. Special permission will be given where a small increase field of a new variety is being grown for planting and certification the following year. :«. Source of Seed, Number of Varieties, Etc. Fields to be eligible for certification must have been sown to seed which came from the Nebraska Agricultural College or Sub - stations or other similar satisfactory sources or which was cer - tified the previous year. Because of the danger of mixing through volunteer grains, certified fields of fall wheat and rye can not be grown on land which the previous season was in other varieties or uncertified seed of these crops. Rosen rye fields' must be at least one-fourth mile from other rye fields due to the danger of cross pollination. 4. Disqualification of Fields. Fields to be eligible for certification must be cut and handled as separate and distinct fields apart from any other grain or var - ieties. When fields are unsatisfactory as to volunteer crops, iden - tity or variety, mixing in cutting, purity, mixture of grains, smut or noxious weeds such as the small-flowered morning glory, the association retains full right to refuse certification. Final de - cision on these matters will rest with a Seed Certification Com - mittee of 5 appointed by the President of th.e Nebraska Crop Growers' Association. </seg>
            <seg id="p237">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION 5. Nature of Inspections of Field. The field inspection will be made so far as possible Just before harvest. The purpose of this inspection is to check up on purity, disease, mixtures, noxious weeds, and to get acquainted with the grower, at which time methods for handling, cleaning, and sell - ing the seed may be discussed. «. Threshed Sample Inspection. • '.". Each grower, before the seed is finally certified, must submit a representative threshed sample similar in quality and condition to what will be supplied to customers. Those failing to supply threshed samples may be refused further certification privileges. This sample will be passed on by the Certification Committee and if satisfactory as to quality, purity, and germination, will be paBsed for final certification. A sample of seed submitted by the grower will be put into the hands of the State Seed Analyst who will report on the germination and purity. This information in ad - dition to that supplied by the field inspection report will be used by the Certification Committee as a basin for certifiration. All certified seed, since it is advertised, must be tagged by the grower When delivering In "bulk, a properly filled In tag should be dis - played on the bin and a sales card should be given to the buyer. 7. Utility Small Grain Show. The threshed samples supplied for certification will be auto - matically entered in the Utility small grain Bhow of the Associa - tion held at Lincoln during Organized Agriculture. It will be con - sidered an offense of sufficient seriousness to bar growers from future certification to submit a sample better than will be sup - plied customers buying certified seed. 8. Fees for Inspection. An Inspection fee of $3.00 per individual will be charged: re - gardless of the number of fields and varieties provided they are all on one farm. Checks for this amount must accompany the applications. In case of hail storms, drought, or other unfavorable crop conditions, or in case the field cannot qualify, the applica - tion may be withdrawn and the fee returned providing the in - spector has not left the secretary's office for that county. In ad - dition to this certification fee a sales tax of 2 per cent of the total value of the certified seed sold for seeding purposes is levied by . the association. The grower should accompany such a fee with a list of the parties to whom he sold seed. The funds raised by the sales .tax will be used for the purpose of advertising the seed, carrying on certification work and for the general promotion of tJie certified seed work. </seg>

The member - ship fee Is *1.00 which entitles one to life membership, a copy of the printed annual report of the association and other membership prlv - , f e8 ; c *» pIlcaUoM for •K»K» seed certification should be in by July 15 tfnd will not be accepted after August 15. 2 ; Varietles — The following kinds of alfalfa seed will be 1 ell - tfble for approval and certification providing they comply with con - (iitions as stated. For Approval • are atM ? e fi braSka Hardy Alfalfa.-Seed from fields of alfalfa which are at least 8 years old and still a reasonably good stand will be eli - gible for approval. These fields may be of any variety such as com- Z2f T &lt; T ri Urke8ta , n or they ="* be Grimm ,„ whlch certlficate8 from recognized associations are not available. Since this seed will be of an unknown or undetermined variety, it can not be certified as to anoro y rf T aPPr ° Ved "^ Seed from flelds **«™ » approved seed or from fields tracing directly t6 registered approved %£&amp;Z2SJr them8elves not yet be 8 year8 old wl » e »- For 'Certification (b) Grimm and Cossack.— Seed from fields for which satis - factory proof can be submitted proving the field to have been seeded to certified Grimm or Cossack seed from a reliable source, will be eligible for certification. Fields of these varieties must in addition show typical variegated flowers when field inspected. Only seed from fields as certified to by recognized state seed associations will be considered as being from a reliable source. (c) Hardlstan Alfalfa.— There are in Dawson County a few fields of hardy alfalfa which during a considerable period of time have proven very hardy and In Experiment Station tests have yielded well. Since definite proof is lacking as to what variety these fields </seg>
            <seg id="p240">JIEPORT OK NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AG1UCUI.TUIIE nre, the name of Hardistan bay been given to this alfalfa. Seed eli - gible for certlll cation must trace directly to the original hardy Ar - nold Bros, field at Cozad or to certified seed of this strain. 3. Disqualifications. — The full right to reject or accept fields of alfalfa for the certification of the seed crop rests entirely with the certification board of the Nebraska Crop Growers' Association who will base its judgment on the proof offered as to the origin of the seed sown on the field, and the reports of the inspector as to plant characteristics. Alfalfa fields having more than a slight trace of sweet clover will be disqualified. The presence of dodder, Canada thistle, or small flowered morning glory automatically disqualifies the field. Certification services will be refused any grower who fails to comply with the rules as to reports, cleaning, sealing, and tagging the seed or who in any other way jeopardizes the standing of certified seed and the confidence of the public therein. Seed from alfalfa fields will not be eligible for approval or cer - tification if the field was sown where an immediately previous seed - ing had failed or made only a partial stand. This is to prevent dan - ger of mixing. 4. Inspections. — Growers interested in having alfalfa fields registered and seed approved or certified must submit an application blank giving the requested information regarding the field. Once fields are accepted they will be registered with the Secretary of the Nebraska Crop Growers' Association and given a definite number. A field inspection will be made when the field is in full bloom to check up weeds, sweet clover, and if the field Is Grimm or. Cos - sack, the variegated blossoms. As soon after threshing as possible growers must submit samples of seed for purity and germination tests. When the seed meets the requirements of the various grades ror quality, germination, and purity an Inspector will then seal the sacks and leave official tags and sales cards with the grower. An association certificate will then be issued to the grower. 5. Fees. — A certification fee of $3.00 must accompany the ap - plication blank. This will be returned If the application is refused on the basis of the information supplied by the application blank. If a field inspection is made the fees will be retained by the asso - ciation. A sales tax of 2 per cent of the value of certified and approved seed sold by growers will be levied, this to be paid the Association following the sale of the seed. It Is the plan to make the alfalfa need certification work self-supporting and to put.it on its own ex - pense as soon as possible. To begin with the Nebraska Agricultural College and Nebraska Crop Growers' Association and County Farm Bureaus will foster the work. The sales tax funds will be put in a fund to pay the expenses of inspections, advertising, and general pro - motion. </seg>
            <seg id="p241">NEBRASKA. CHOP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION 6. Seed grades and' tags. — The following standards have been adopted (or the various grades of alfalfa seed for 1929-30. Grades of Nebraska Certified and Approved alfalfa. Blue Tag Extra No. 1. — Purity 99.50; sound, plump seed. No noxious weeds. Sweet clover free. This is the highest commercial grade and it is especially recommended as foundation seed for plant - ing new fields for seed production. Red Tag No. 1. — Purity 99.00 per cent; sound, plump seed. Nox - ious weed free. This grade may contain one-sixteenth of one per cent sweet clover, with a maximum tolerance of 3 sweet clover seeds in Ave grams of alfalfa seed. Yellow Tag No. 2. — Genuine certified seed as to history, below Quality standards of grade No. 1. Certified as to variety but no purity implied. Seed of this grade must meet, in all respects, the require - ments of the Nebraska State Seed Law. Growers of certified seed and individuals or firms handling! such seed are responsible to the Nebraska Crop Growers' Association for the quality of the seed as designated by the certification tag at - tached to bags. * APPLICATION FOR ALFALFA SEED CERTIFICATION Date ! !

As a result of the alfalfa seed work 5 fields were certified as Grimm and 19 fields were approved. These field's produced a total of approximately 9,000 pounds of certified Grimm and 120,000 pounds of hardy approved seed. By chance, there was in 1929 a large crop of alfalfa seed throughout the state of Nebraska and It was more difficult to sell the hardy approved at a premium price than was an - ticipated.

The following seed list was published and distributed widely over the state. HAKDY APPltOVED ALFAliPA SKKD Know the History as Well as the Origin of the Seed You Buy WHAT IS GOOD ALFALFA SEED? Not All Home Grown Seed Is Necessarily Good Seed! Imported seed and seed from many other states is known to lack sufficient hardiness to be satisfactory for Nebraska conditions. Vet if such seed is planted in Nebraska it may live long enough to produce one or two seed crops. Such seed would be "home grown seed," but would not have the winter hardiness that the careful larmer wants in the seed he plants. II Is Therefore Important to Know the History of the Seed We Plant! Before buying seed one should, inquire as to age of the field from which the seed came. The older a field is, provided it is still a good stand, the more assurance there is that the seed will prove winter hardy. It Does Not Pay to Take a Chance! One should buy only seed of known origin and history. The Nebraska Crop Growers' Association has made it possible for every farmer to buy dependable seed. This association has placed its stamp o' approval on certain lots of seed after carefully checking and in - specting the fields from which this seed came. HAUDY APPROVED AL.FALFA SEED Comes From Fields Which Are 8 to 25 Years Old, mid Still a Good Stand These fields have been inspected by the Nebraska Crop Growers' Association, and the seed has been sealed and tagged under rules prepared by the College of Agriculture. It is dodder and sweet clover free, and is of high purity and germination. No better seed of the common variety can be found. </seg>

The Association is thus able to help farmers get good seed, and to direct them at once to a dependable supply. - Sources of Hardy- Approved Seed This seed is mostly still in the growers' hands, but a part of it is being sold thru the regular seed trade. The Farmers Union at Omaha purchased a considerable quantity of this seed and is dis - tributing it thru its various local organizations. Other seed dealers may handle a part of this seed.

COUNTY CHOI'S AND SOILS PHOGKAM CONTEST The Nebraska Crop Growers' Association in 191. sponsored a contest among Nebraska County Agricultural Agents in an effort to increase the interest in crop improvement work. As an inducement the Association offered two trips to the International Grain and Hay Show to the two Nebraska county agents carrying on the best county crops and soils program. Twelve county agents entered the contest and five submitted ex - cellent detailed reports. These were all so good that it was difficult for the judging committee to make a decision as to the winners. Alvah Hecht of Buffalo county and E. C. Nelson of Morrlll county were se - lected as winners and made the trip to Chicago. At the meeting of the Board of Directors of the Nebraska 1 Crop Growers' Association, Feb. 15, 1930, it was decided to continue the contest for another year under new rules to be drawn up by the Sec - retary and Associate Secretary of the organization. The following rules we^e prepared to govern the 1930 contest: Announcement of Second Annual Crops and Soils Improvement Con - test Open to Nebraska County Extension Agents, 1930 The Nebraska Crop Growers' Association offers two trips to Chi - cago to the International Grain and Hay Show and events held in conjunction, to the two Nebraska County Agricultural Agents, who in 1930 carry on- the best Agronomy program in their respective counties.

One of these is under the control of the Association directly and consists of moneys received for membership and for Inspection and sales tax of seed certification work. This fund is used largely for the seed certification work, since it is from members of the Association who co-operate in this project. The Association also received $1,750 as annual appropriation from the legislature through the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture.

He made a motion it be recommended to the officers of the Nebraska Crop Growers' Association that the allowance for the 4-H crops judging team be increased from fifty to one hundred dollars. The motion was seconded and carried, after some discussion, all of which was favorable to the action. Prof. Keim brought up the matter of increasing the allowance for the College Crops Judging Team which represents the state at the Kansas City contest and also at the International contest in case it Is reinstated. After some discussion a motion was made and sec - onded to recommend that if the budget will allow It, the fund for the College Crops Judging Team be increased to one hundred and fifty dollars.

The matter of drawing up a new constitution and by-laws for the Association was discussed. It was pointed out that the old constitution is some 21 years old and does not fully cover the activities of the organization as now conducted. Motion was made by Stewart and seconded by Mr. Wahlgren, that President Magee appoint a committee of three, of which he act as chairman, to revise the constitution and by-laws and present the same at the next annual meeting. Motion was car - ried. President Magee appointed P. H. Stewart and H. L. Wahlgren to serve with him on the committee. The question of Nebraska com - petitive exhibits and educational exhibits at the International Grain and Hay Show was discussed. It seemed to be the concensus of opin - ion that educational exhibits so far from Nebraska were of doubtful \alue but that competitive exhibits advertising the state might be increased somewhat. After a thorough discussion of the matter, Mr. DIetz moved and Ebers seconded a motion that the President appoint an Interested and competent person to work up and look after com- </seg>

Motion was carried and the President appointed Mr. Biermann to take charge of the exhibit providing he can get away. The matter of a utility shelled corn show at the winter meet - ings was discussed. Also the matter of utility small grain show, the samples to be from the certified seed. There was some discussion as to whether or not offering prizes on the samples sent in to represent cer - tified seed lots might bring in better samples than were actually for sale at home in the bin. Methods for overcoming this were dis - cussed. A motion was carried to continue the utility small grain show lor 1931. Motion was carried that we continue the annual corn show at Lincoln and add the utility show of shelled corn, said shelled corn samples to be from the field run samples of . fields entered in the 10 - acre Corn Yield Contest. Mr. Dletz suggested that the utility corn bhow be based on divisions of the state as divided for the contest. This was agreed upon. Adjournment for lunch at which time Dean Burr and Director W. H. Brokaw spoke briefly. Business meeting reconvened at 2:15. Prof. Claude Minteer spoke of crops judging contests for Smith- Hughes schools and asked the Association to offer some sort of an award to winning teams in judging and in the identification contest at Lincoln and at North Platte. After some discussion of this matter Mr. Dietz moved that the Crop Growers' Association make awards of some kind to support the above team. Seconded by Mr. Mott and carried. The matter of money awards for the 4-H and College crops judging teams which represents the state at Chicago, was taken up. After thorough discussion of the matter motion was carried that the Crop Growers' Association give 100 dollars toward the expenses of the 4-H crops judging team and $150 toward the expenses of the College crops judging team for the Chicago trip. Motion seconded by Mr. Pietz and carried. The matter of again offering the contest for County Crops and Soils Program with trips to Chicago International Grain and Hay Show and the International Crop Improvement Asso - ciation meetings for the two outstanding programs was discussed. It was moved by Mr. Ebers, seconded by Mr. Biermann, that we con - tinue the contest much on the lines as laid out for last year. Motion carried. The matter of certification of small grain for 1930 was taken up. The standards adopted by the International Crop Improvement Asso - ciation were read and explained. After considerable discussion, par - ticularly on the point of one variety of each crop per farm, It was moved by Mr. Mott and seconded by Mr. Ebers that we adopt those standards for the coming year. Other minor revisions in the riles for certification were made. Dr. Klesselbach of the Experiment Sta - tion advised as to the proper varieties to certify and gave data on their relative yields. The Glabron variety of barley was added to those certified for 1929-30. </seg>

NEBRASKA . Wednesday, January 8, 1930 PRESIDENT i L. H. DAFT. Lincoln SECRETARY Lj* K. CROWE, Lincoln MR, L. H. DAFT. We have come to the hours of opening the 47th annual meeting of the Nebraska State Dairymen's Association. This year our plan and program is just a little different than It has been in some other years. For the first time, we are going to present the medals and certificates of production at the banquet tomorrow evening rather than at this afternoon's meeting. The members or the Dairy Herd Improvement Associations will please take notice or this change from our customary, program. The medals and awards will be presented at the banquet. If you do not have tickets, get them from Mr. L. K. Crowe, the secretary of this association. The reservation is $1.25 each. The banquet will be held at the Grand Hotel tomorrow evening. There will be a splendid time as we have always had. Each year as we go along marks another milestone in the progress or the dairy industry in the state of Nebraska. Nineteen twenty nine is no exception to the general rule. Last evening, after I got home from the Master Farmers' Banquet, I glanced through the latest issue of Hoard's Dairyman, and noticed with a great deal of satisfaction that Nebraska now ranks fifth in the manufacture or dairy products. For a number or years, Nebraska has been fourth in the production or creamery butter, her cheese production has been for some time of little Importance. However, during the last three years, the cheese industry has come rapidly to the front, and Nebraska now ranks fifth in manufactured dairy products. This is an achievement or which we have a right to reel proud. The Extension Department of the University, the Dairy Department of the College, the Nebraska Dairy </seg>
            <seg id="p291">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION ■ ' I Development Society, this Association, and all of the various organiza - tions which make up this great Industry have a right to feel proud of this achievement and to feel that our efforts have not been In vain. The states outranking Nebraska are Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa and California, and it will only be a few years until we will be giving them a rather serious rub. \ The boys are bringing in a 'sign which displays the cups, medals and plaques which will be awarded at the banquet tomorrow night. I am sure that every member of the association as an individual and every member of each dairy herd Improvement association, willj feel that. these awards are worth while. It is not the object of the associa - tion to set up contests between individuals and separate associations for the purpose of having a contest or race to see which individual can make the best record. We are proud of the fellow who makes the best record, but we do not wish to encourage the idea that a man must join the association in order to beat the record that some neigh - bor made. The member of the dairy herd improvement association should keep In mind the record he made last year. He is In a contest with himself, not with somebody else. He is going to make a record, but it is for this achievement, and not because of beating someone else that he will do it. We are glad to present these awards at the end of our year's activities. The business meeting of this association will be held this after - noon immediately after we finish our formal program. We will have olectlon of officers and there are two amendments to the constitution to be voted on and we want as many as possible to stay for this business meeting. We shall try to make the meeting snappy anl to the point. . &gt; Dr. Hays is here representing the State Veterinarian's office and he has a matter that I shall be glad to have him present to the mem - bers of our Association. You have read some of the articles that have been published about the relation which exists between con - tagious abortion affecting dairy cattle and undulant fever which attacks man. Some articles have been published which seem to doubt that there is any direct connection and some' so-called authorities on i the subject have gone so far as to indicate that people should quit using milk or at least raw milk, and it has had some effect on the amount of milk used in certain communities. A great real of discussion has taken place in almost every community as to the value of some of the statements that have been made and Dr. Van Es, who is an eminent authority on this matter, has collected all the data, and the State Veterinarian's office has published it in the form of a bulletin which Dr. Hays will now explain. DR. HAYS: Mr. Daft has given a very able presentation of some of the things I am here to discuss. I come before you to present in a printed form a speech that was made recently, by a person whom you </seg>
            <seg id="p292">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE all know, regarding undulant fever, and that person has the knowledge to present that subject in a most precise way. I refer to a speech presented before the annual meeting of the Nebraska Veterinary Med - ical Association by Dr. L. Van Es early in December of the year Just closed. There has been a very great amount of discussion in the last several months of an article published in one of the popular magazines regarding undulant fever in man. I do not recall of being In any meeting where diseases of livestock have been discussed, that is recent meetings, but that abortion disease has occupied a very prominent place in the discussions. From many statements that have been made by those engaged in such discussions, I am quite sure that the article to which I refer has been misleading although it has dealt with facts. The article that appeared in the press to which I refer was Very ably presented, was very enticing and alluring to read, but it put into the public mind some wrong impressions. The effect of wrong im - pressions on the public mind in dealing with problems of public health was very ably presented before a meeting, which I had the pleasure of attending, when Dr. Evans of Chicago 'discussed the subject of a disturbed public mind by reason of wide-spread reports of disease occurring as a result of food factors, particularly as related to milk borne infections. The particular question of milk borne disease relates itself to this question of undulant fever and concerns you people very vitally. Having in mind, from our experience as well as from the ex - periences of others, the fact of a disturbed public mind we considered it a very timely thing to bring to the attention of the public in Ne - braska correct Information dealing with definite facts regarding un - dulant fever. Dr. L. Van Es was the one man who could do this. He presented the paper we referred to before the Veterinary Medical Association largely by reason of encouragement that we gave to have the paper preserved and published for distribution. Dr. Van Es has reviewed, in preparing the paper, sixty-nine references, not only Ameri - can but foreign references, and it is quite a job if you have ever taken the work to review and select the facts from such references. I believe it timely to explain this paper that you may, if I may say, read it more intelligently. The first part of the paper is given to the references more largely than to any opinion that Dr. Van Es himself expresses. In the last part of the .paper you will get his opinion. We have asked. the Doctor to prepare a synopsis of the paper and this we have placed in the first part of the bulletin as a loose leaf. I believe it will benefit you to read carefully the contents, par - ticularly of the synopsis, and then of the bulletin. We only had a limited issue of three thousand copies published and to date have distributed over twenty-five hundred bo that our. present supply is very limited. We want to put these in the hands </seg>
            <seg id="p293">NEBRASKA STATE DAIKYMENS ASSOCIATION of people who will appreciate tliom in the first pluce and read them in the second place. If these were put into a more costly binding they would fit nicely into any library. 1 have a great deal of pride in having had a part in the publication of this information., I would like to have the opportunity, but I am not going to take your time at the present moment, of discussing abortion disease because I believe there is a very gross misunderstanding as to what may be done and what should be done in handling livestock relating to control of that disease. It is not a hopeless situation for Wre is much that can be done and which must in a large part be \ done by the herdsmen and owners. I would have, however, just a moment to in a way defend our Department in Its present Job relative to abortion disease. We have no definite program to combat abortion disease In livestock as we I have in dealing with tuberculosis, particularly of cattle. We have not placed upon our statutes laws pertaining particularly to abortion disease, although that was attempted by some interested cattle owners at the time of the last legislature. We do not feel that there is a great deal at the present moment to be gained by regulatory measures prohibiting the importation of cattle specifically as would relate to abortion disease. We have much disease among our livestock and should take steps to do something to control and prevent the increased spread of the infection. I am convinced that we can with a proper cooperation with the cattle owners, materially affect the situation, and without a con - siderable outlay of money. I must not take any more of your time but trust it will be my privilege of discussing this subject to greater extent at some later date. If there are not sufficient of these bulletins to supply those who desire them in attendance here we shall be very glad to send you one upon" request. MR. McGINNIS. May I have a word? MR. DAFT. You may, Mr. McGlnnis. Mr. McGinnis. Ladies and Gentlemen of the State Dairymen's Association. I am a little bit late in getting here. The signals were against me. You may be surprised when I tell you that I am out here in the Interest of the dairymen, and for some reason unknown to me, I was selected from the Chamber of Commerce to welcome all you people. If you have not been there, we hope you will make it your headquarters while you are in Lincoln. You will find splendid accom - modations of all kinds, the dally newspapers, market reports, weather reports are there, stenographers to write your letters, lunches served at noon, pool room and billiards to amuse you, or you may sit! and rest or have your wives and children meet you there. You will be very welcome and we are anxious to have you take advantage of this offer. Thank you. </seg>
            <seg id="p294">ItErOKT OK NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE MR. DAFT. We appreciate this, courtesy on the part of the Cham - ber of Commerce, and I know our people will be glad to take advantage of this offer. I want to express the appreciation of this association to Dr. Hays and his department in distributing the information on contagious abortion. We all recognize Dr. Van Es as an authority on any subject to which he turns his mind. I am sure our State Depart - ment has done a work of real value to the public in general by secur - ing this information from Dr. Van Es and putting it in a form in which it can be put in "the hands of those who are interested. If you want information on the subject, take the bulletin and read it, but the supply is limited and we desire to get them into the hands of people who are interested in the subject. At this point, I wish to pause just long enough in our program to appoint a committee on resolutions. I shall appoint Bob McGlnnis, Sumner Darnell and Carl Becker. T want to* make Bob chairman of this committee. He is the best "resoluter" in the state. I am sorry that this committee will have to retire some time during the progress of our meeting in order to make up the resolutions. But I have an idea that Bob has them already written out so that all they will have to do is go outside the door and come back in again. Each year we have a good deal of a struggle in the compiling of our program, because we always want it to equal or better the program we had the year previous. If possible. They have always been on such a high level, it is hard to do this. But with Professor Davis in charge of this year's program, we seem to have exceeded any array of talent that we have had for some time. Many of you will recall Secretary Musser of The American Guern - sey Cattle Club, who appeared on the program two years ago. This year we have been able to secure a representative of one of the other breed associations. I think any of you who are in touch with these breed association representatives, will understand the Importance of the national purebred associations, the caliber of the men that till the office of secretary and make them the live, throbbing, pulsating influence that they are throughout the country, a very high type of business men who make their associations stand for something. It is a distinct pleasure to me to welcome to our city again this year, the secretary of The American Jersey Cattle Club, and it is a further pleasure to be able to introduce him to the members of our state association at this time. He will speak on the subject, "Will a Purebred Sire Increase Production?" Mr. Lewis W. Morley. MR. MORLEY. "A pure bred is an animal whose sire and dam are both pure bred. Registration in the Herd Book of the Breed is proof that the animal is a pure bred." This, in general, is the defini - tion that most of us were taught in answer to the question — What is a pure bred? This definition, particularly as It applies to the pure </seg>
            <seg id="p295">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION I bred dairy sire, may soon become obsolete. We are fast coming to think of a sire not alone in terms of purity of blood. A study of Genetics soon discloses that plants and animals may be pure in their inheritance and transmitting ability for a great num - ber of characteristics. A sire can transmit to his offspring only those characteristics which he has inherited from his ancestors. At present probably few of our cattle are pure so far as their inheritance is concerned, except possibly the color. The breeding of dairy cattle has, therefore, not reached the place where one can foretell exactly what the offspring will be from any given mating. High production and desirable conformation are the two out - standing characteristics sought today in our dairy animals. Of these two, that of production 1b of course paramount with most dairymen and breeders. It is this characteristic of high production with which we are primarily concerned today. All sires, of course, receive but half of their inheritance from their dam and all production charac - teristics must be determined through the production records of the sire's dam and his other female relatives. The first thing to consider in determining whether the pure bred sire will increase production is to know the milk and fat records of all or as many as possible of his near female relatives. If these records are comparatively high, say from 500 to 550 pounds of fat, it is a pretty safe guess that this sire will increase the production of his daughters over their dams when he is used in a herd where the average production is 200 to 250 pounds of fat. If, however, this same sire is used in a herd whete the producing ability of the herd is higher, say from 450 to 550 pounds fat, he cannot be depended on to increase production and may actually de - crease it. If this same sire Is bred to females producing 600 pounds of fat it is almost certain that he will decrease the production of his daughters when their records are compared with those of the dams. In tabulation of thousands of cow testing or Dairy Herd Improve - ment Association records the Bureau of Dairying has found that the production records of the daughters of a bull are the most valuable criterion by which he may be judged. One hears a great deal these days about the proven sire, meaning a sire that has proved his transmitting ability through the records of his daughters. A study of pure bred dairy bulls each having five or more daugh - ters whose yearly milk and butterfat records could be compared with the yearly milk and butterfat records of their dams showed that of nine bulls which were used in the herds where the dams averaged yearly 200 pounds or less of butterfat, everyone increased the produc - tion of the daughter over that of the dams of the daughters. Out of 49 bulls which were used in herds that averaged 200 and 300 pounds of </seg>
            <seg id="p296">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE HOARD OF AGRICULTURE butlerfat, 44 increased and 5 decreased production. Of the 85 bulls used in herds that averaged from 300 to 400 pounds of butterfat, 57 increased and 28 decreased production. Out of 57 bulls used in herds that averaged '400 pounds of butterfat or over, 28 increased and 29 decreased production. These figures show that it is only the best class of pure bred bulls that are capable of materially increasing production in high pro - ducing dairy herds. There is little hope, then, for herds in which grade and scrub sires are used. Since only one-fourth of the dairy bulls are pure bred, the first great forward movement in dairy herd improvement is the elimination of the scrub and grade sire. The second step is the elimination of all inferior pure bred sires. And the third and final step is the general use of good, proved bulls, that is, bulls that have already demonstrated their ability to Increase the production of a high producing dairy herd. In the State of Nebraska the Bureau has found several proven sires: Sire No. 1. Five pairs of records. Milk Butterfat Daughters 9.871 341 Dams 9.703 350 Daughters excelled dams Milk — 168 pounds, or 1.7%. Daughters produced less than dams Butterfat 9 pounds, or 2.6% Sire No. 2.

Butterfat 23 pounds, or 4.9% The average production of our cows must be materially increased if dairying is to be increasingly profitable. This must come through the use of pure bred sires — pure not alone In blood but pure from the standpoint of their ability to sire high production daughters. To prove these sires through a knowledge of the production of their daughters necessitates far more testing than has been done in the past. In fact it is through testing that our immediate progress must be made. </seg>
            <seg id="p297">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION The type of testing will, of course, depend on conditions in gen - eral. An increasing number of dairymen and breeders are paying less and less attention to the spectacular high individual record and more and more attention to high average herd production. The Breed Associations have recognized that a system of testing which emphasizes only the individual record which is made at a relatively high cost is not sufficient at the present time and have all adopted herd test plans which, though not uniform at the present time, ia an effort on the part of the organization to meet these changing conditions. MR. DAFT. I am sure we are grateful to Secretary Morley of The American Jersey Cattle Club, for this address on the possibility of increasing production through the purebred sire. We are trusting that we shall have the pleasure of Mr. Morley's visiting us often in the years to come. I want to pause just a moment in our program to call attention to the program of the Nebraska Dairy Development Society &gt; which will be held in this room tomorrow morning. Mr. M. D. Munn, presi - dent of the National Dairy Council, Chicago, is the principal speaker. I am sure you will want to hear him. Mr. Carl R. Gray, of Omaha, president of the society and president of the Union Pacific Railroad, will preside. For the benefit of late comers, I wish to again announce the banquet for tomorrow evening and at that banquet we shall award the medals and certificates of production for 1929. 1 trust that as many of you as possible will be there and enjoy our program ac that time: Last year, you will recall that I announced an effort on the part of the program committee to secure the Chief of the Bureau of Dairy Industry of the United States Department of Agriculture, toj speak to us, a man whom- it would be a pleasure to hear. But he had so recently taken up his duties at Washington, D. C, he felt it impossible to leave his new task and come to us at that time. So he sent Dr. J. C. McDowell, who gave us a splendid talk. Dr. McDowell ia an authority on the matter of dairy herd improvement association records, knows more and ia familiar with more recorda than any living man. We are always glad to have these men, but it is always a pleasure to have the boss himself. This year, we have the boss, Dr. O. E. Reed, who Is the Chief of the Bureau of Dairying" and who will speak on "How Can Milk Production Be Increased Economically." Mr. Reed. DR. REED. The favorable situation of the dairy 'industry during the past few years has attracted the attention of many individuals as well as communities engaged in other branches of farming. In many sections a great effort has been made to expand the dairy in - dustry, and as a result new production centers have been developed. </seg>
            <seg id="p298">KEPOKT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Many new manufacturing plants have been established and through mergers and consolidations some processing plants have been made more efficient and their output has been increased. The effect of this general expansion has been reflected in the amount of dairy products on hand and in the prevailing low prices during the past few weeks. It can hardly be said, however, that the decline in prices is due en - tirely to the expansion of the industry. It is also partly due to the inability of the consumer to buy. During the past few years the general opinion has prevailed that the dairy business could not be overdone. Whether or not this is true, it beho'oves those engaged in the industry- to study the situation and make every effort to. keep the industry on; a stable basis. When production exceeds consumption a surplus results and lower prices prevail. The producer has an important part to play in this relation - ship between production and consumption. The present slump in prices may be only temporary, but it is of sufficient importance to command the attention of every dairyman. I . do not mean to be pessimistic about the present situation. In spite of lower prices the dairyman is relatively "well off." We must, however, face conditions as they exist. Butter prices have declined, and since these prices are a fair index of the price farmers receive for all dairy products, we must assume that on the whole dairymen are receiving less Tor their products now than they were three months ago. At that time they may have made money from cows averaging 200 to 250 pounds of butterfat per year, but today they must have better cows. It is safe to assume that dairymen will take no action to increase dairy production at present. Instead, every effort should be made to adjust production to demand. It is difficult for dairymen to change the production to meet the demand in as short a time as can other industries. A few days ago I heard Mr. Legge, Chairman of the Federal Farm Board, make a statement relative to the steel industry which illustrates this point. He stated that six months ago the steel manufacturers were operating approximately 94% of their blast fur - naces, but today only 65% of these furnaces are in operation. The demand for steel fell off so they stopped the manufacture. While it is impossible in so short a time to stop the production of a large pro - portion of our dairy herds it is possible arid profitable to rid our herds of the poorest producers. It has been estimated that one-third of our dairy cows are not returning a profit to their owners. It is good business to rid the dairy herds of many of these Inferior producers. There is no danger of causing a shortage of dairy, products by culling out from 5 to 10 per cent of the lowest producers. Whenever there is a demand for more dairy products it is always possibfe to increase the production of the remaining cows through better feeding. </seg>
            <seg id="p299">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION According to the bureau or Agricultural Economics of the De - partment of Agriculture the consumption of dairy products last year was about 1% greater than domestic production. It was necessary therefore, to import only enough dairy products for about two days supply. Should a surplus amounting to 2.5 days supply be accumu - lated in the United States we could eliminate the surplus by culling out 2% of our lowest producing cows. If 5% of these lowest producers were eliminated almost 8 days of the nation's supply would be cut off. The particular question that was assigned to me for today is •!How Far Can Milk Production Be Increased Economically?" The relatively unfavorable position of the industry at the present time makes this a timely question. I wish it were possible to answer this question definitely and positively to fit every condition. But so many variable factors influence production of dairy products that it Will be possible to discuss the question only in a general way. The points at which profitable production per cow begin and cease depend primarily on the kind and cost of feed, price of product, cost of labor and quality of cow. Where feed is of superior quality and cheap, as in some Western states, and in districts bordering the Corn Belt, feed cost per cow is relatively low. Where home grown feeds are low in yield and pur - chased feeds are high in price, feed cost per cow is relatively high. Many cows are underfed, as shown by the number of thin cows seen on our dairy farms. There are onry two periods in the life or a normal cow when the quantity of feed should be less than that required to maintain the weight of the cow. One of these is the period of drying off when it is often desirable to reduce the quantity or feed for a short time. The loss of weight at this time with most cows is of no considerable importance. The other period of under - feeding comes after freshening and lasts ror 3 to 6 weeks, depending on the condition of the cow at time of calving. The fatter the 1 cow the longer the period of underfeeding. It seems to me that the results or a reeding experiment that we have carried on at our Huntley. Montana, experiment stations are particularly applicable to the subject. This experiment extended over a period or years in which time each animal was red a ration or roughage alone for one lactation period, a limited grain ration In addition to roughage, a second lactation period, and on a rull grain ration In addition to roughage for a third lactation period. We think that because of the period of time that has been covered the results are unusually accurate and that they can be applied wherever you have roughage of equally good quality and cows of equally high producing capacity. The feeds used in this experiment were: (1) roughage alone, con - sisting of corn silage, roots, alfalfa hay, and Irrigated pasture; (2) the </seg>
            <seg id="p300">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Kaiue roughages and a limited grain ration of one pound of grain mixture to each six pounds of milk produced; and (3) the same roughages and a full grain ration of one pound 'of grain to each three pounds of milk produced. The records were for 365 days and were made under semi-official test regulations of the Holsteln-Frleslan Association of America, the cows being milked three times daily throughout the year but otherwise were kept under the usual herd conditions. The following records, calculated to maturity, were made by the 10 cows on the different rations: Milk Butterfat Full grain ration 17,851 619.9 Limited grain ration l_16,648 584.1 Roughage ration 13,656 478.6 Three cows on the roughage ration produced 549 pounds, 531 pounds, and 526 pounds of butterfat respectively. When the prevailing prices for feed and for milk and butterfat were used the returns over cost of feed were $132 per cow on the full grain ration; $185 per cow on the limited grain ration, and $161 per cow on the roughage. The limited ration was therefore the most profitable with roughage ration a close second. The feed cost per pound of butterfat was: 19.5 cents on the roughage ration, 22 cents on the limited grain and 30 cents on the full grain. This experiment has been continued until at the present time 42 cows on the full grain ration, 13 cows on the limited grain ration, and 15 cows on the roughage ration have completed the semi - official records of milk and butterfat production. The results are as shown: Butterfat Production No. I • Milk Calculated Cows ! A Ke Ration Production Actual to Maturity^ ~Y-M ■ Lib*. ' Lbs. . Lbs. 42 3-8 Full grain 14,868.1 519.08 613.4 13 6-1 Limited grain 16,200.5 566.86 588.9 15 6-5 Roughage 13,032.8 452.88 465.3 In considering the relation of grain feeding to milk production, I fully realize that on many farms It would be profitable to feed the cows more grain than they are now receiving but even so the economy of milk production must be given careful attention. Although It is Impossible to show In the table the income over cost of feed for each cow, you may be Interested In knowing that the degree of profit or returns over feed cost on all three phases of the </seg>
            <seg id="p301">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION feeding experiment followed very closely the ranking of the cows in size of record. This was particularly true on the roughage alone and on the limited grain rations. On the full grain ration where the cows were apparently overfed to a certain extent, the amount of profit still followed the size of the record but not so closely as in the other two phases. On the roughage alone the highest record made was 549 pounds butterfat. This same cow made the greatest return over feed cost with $210.81. The lowest record on roughage was 362 pounds butter - fat and this cow also had the lowest return over cost of feed, namely 1107.55. On the limited grain ration the two highest producing cowsjmade 627 and 626 pounds butterfat. These two cows also made the great - est returns over cost of feed, the returns for each being nearly $208. The lowest producing cow also had the lowest return over cost of feed. Her record was 471 pounds butterfat and her returns over feed cost 140.75. The highest record made on the full grain ration was 713 pounds butterfat. This cow also had the greatest returns over cost of feed. $215.81. The second lowest record was 477 pounds butterfat. This cow had the lowest returns over cost of feed, namely, $94.93 In one respect the results of this experiment are paradoxical, in that the group on full grain produced the most milk but had the lowest return over cost of food. Yet when the individual cows in each group were considered the highest producers were the most profitable and the lowest producers the least profitable. This is explained by the fact that the cows with the greater inheritance for producing capacity responded profitably to an increased rate of feeding, while the cows of lower producing level could not profitably respond to the heavier feeding. • It is apparent from these results that the level of production where diminished returns will set in are dependent to a large extent on the method of feeding. It should be stated, too, that the price received for the product and the cost of feed must be con - sidered.- One herd of 14 cows on test in one of your dairy herd improve - ment associations right here in Nebraska was fed, milked, and taken care of for a whole year and failed to make an income over cost of feed by $182. The owner received nothing for his labor, nothing for overhead expenses, and actually he had to dig down in his pocket and fish out $182 to pay a part of the feed bin. The average yearly butterfat production of this herd was 131 pounds per cow. The lowest producing cow in that herd produced 28 pounds of butterfat and failed to make an Income over cost of feed by $59. Here was a herd that produced below the limit of profitable production. Suppose we look the other way to see whether there are any high-producing unprofitable cows and herds. A herd of 17 cows in </seg>
            <seg id="p302">REPORT OK NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE another state had an average yearly butterfat production per cow of 391 pounds. In one year's time the average cost of feed per cow was $177 and the average income over cost of feed per cow was $17, not . anywhere nearly enough to pay for overhead, leaving nothing at all for labor. One of the cows in that unprofitable herd produced 349 pounds of butterfat. She ate $171 worth of. feed and her income over cost of feed for the year was minus 54 cents. Another factor that influences the limit of profitable production is the quality of our dairy products. Quality has a definite relation to demand. The production of a clean, wholesome, safe supply of milk is very largely the problem of the producer. It has been estimated : (hat every year approximately $40,000,000 is lost to the dairy indus - try through low grade milk and cream. Much of this loss is suffered by the farmer. The producer of dairy products should be interested in doing everything possible to insure the- delivery of a good, wholesome, safe product to the consumer. In far too many cases the producer of market milk waits for the milk inspector to inform him how to pro - duce clean milk. In many other cases the producer objects, to certain rules that are required to be followed in the production of clean milk. The producer who has to be forced to adopt methods that will result in a good clean milk is and will always remain a liability to the dairy industry. I appreciate that this subject of producing clean milk and cream has been much discussed in relation to price received. The - demand for dairy products, however, will never reach its highest point until the product offered for sale is of the highest quality. The. dairy - men should be the leaders' in an effort to produce a clean, wholesome, safe milk supply regardless of whether they produce milk for direct consumption or for manufacturing purposes. No other food known to mankind today has a more direct relation to the health of the human being than 3oes milk. Recent investiga- - tions have proved this beyond any doubt. Since It is rich in both calcium and phosphorus, milk is a very effective food for supplement - ing the deficiencies of other substances, such as cereals, grains, tubers, and fleshy roots, which are relatively' poor in these elements. In re - cent years much stress has been given to the vitamin content of food - stuffs. These vitamins have been described as accessory food factors that are essential for the proper functioning of the animal body. Milk contains several of the vitamins. The dairymen above all others should be back of an educational campaign to acquaint the public with these facts. It has been the experience of those conducting mllk-for-health campaigns that the public welcomes such information. When the matter is brought to the attention of the parents of children and of school authorities, de - finite action is always taken to encourage a greater use of milk in the diet. While our per capita consumption has increased considerably </seg>
            <seg id="p303">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION during the past ten years, we know that a large per cent of our pop - ulation is consuming a much smaller quantity of milk and milk pro - ducts than is required to meet the body needs. It is well within the province of the producer and manufacturer of dairy products to give of their means in an effort to acquaint the public with the value of these products. On the whole the dairymen throughout the country have not taken advantage of the opportunity to increase consumption. In conclusion. I wish to emphasize again the importance of pro - ducing high quality products efficiently. It is my belief that as far as the dairy farmer should meet the present low dairy prices by! the methods I have outlined. The lower limits of production of our dairy herds must be raised. This can be accomplished by getting rid of ow producers. The upper limit of profitable production likewise niust be raised, and this is possible through better feeding and better breed - ing. In this effort to increase efficiency and improve quality i the dairyman must use to the fullest extent all the information and meth - ods which science has made available to him. MR. DAFT. Wasn't that fine? We are surely grateful to . Dr. Reed for that splendid address. What are we going to do abouj it? It doesn't do us much good if we just sit here and hear what these men say and possibly get the. annual report of the association a .ew months hence, and read it. We should go home and put some of these practices into use. I am sorry that Dr. Reed has to leave and cannot be here tomorrow night, but glad he gave us this splendid I again want to call attention to the Dairymen's Banquet tomor - row night at which time the following awards for the year 1929 Will be made. A cup will be awarded to the Dairy Herd Improvement Asso - ciation which has made the highest record during the year. A gold medal will be awarded to the owner of the herd having the highest average butterfat production for the year. A silver medal will be awarded to the herd with the second highest average butterfat production. Silver medals will also be awarded to all herds averaging over 450 pounds of butterfat. A plaque will be awarded to the owner of the herd of ten' or more cows which has made an average of 400 pounds of butterfati or better for a period of five years, with no year's production less than 350 pounds. We have just finished our fifth year of dairy herd im - provement association work In the state of Nebraska and one or more of these plaques will be awarded tomorrow night. I know there is at least one and possibly two or three in the state that have made that average for the entire five years. . </seg>

But for two years we have been trying to get Mr. Conklln here.

            <seg id="p306">REPORT OV NEHRASKA STATE KOA.RU OP AfiRICUl.TURH tlie first nientloned qualities. We know when we have them because they can be measured in pounds of milk 'and can be judged by stand - ards of type fixed in our minds. The ability to reproduce consistently is not as certain in the grade however, and it is here that many of the disappointments come. In this respect purebreHs are most likely to excell since there is a greater certainty that their inheritance is more fixed for desirable factors than the others. This is true since the better breeders have been constantly culling and removing from breed - ing herds those animals that do not reproduce satisfactorily. Through this procedure and the mating of those animals that are of the right type and have producing ability, these characters are gradually more fixed in inheritance and thus are more certain of reproduction. Kor this reason one can have more assurance of .success with the purebred than with the grade. A successful business must be founded upon the following con - siderations: 1. Herds must be profitable from the standpoint of. production. 2. Breeding animals must be selected on a real value basis. 3. Records of production must be continuously kept. 4. Health must be maintained. 5. Accurate breeding history of every animal must be kept. 6. Proper feeding and intelligent management practices must be given attention. 7. Culling rigidly must be done at all times. If these items are carefully followed one can develop a profitable herd of either purebred or grade cattle. For some it may be best that they stay with grades; for others the purebred will offer the greatest opportunity. One who expects to profit with purebreds, however, must be a salesman as well as a cow man and it is at this point where many fail. If one has an intense liking for dairy cattle, and will give the business the careful attention needed, if he will study the best methods of advertising and has originality or sufficient worth, so that he can attract attention to his product, if he will deal honestly and fairly at all times, I am sure the purebred dairy cattle business will prove a profitable and exceedingly interesting vocation.

Article 5, Section 1, of the Constitution, reads at this time: 'The officers of the Association shall consist of a President, Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer and five Directors." The proposed reading: "The officers of the Asso - ciation shall consist of President, Vice President, Secretary-Treasurer, Assistant Secretary and five Directors." i MR. DAFT. Gentlemen, you have heard this first amendment. The provision makes it possible to elect an Assistant Secretary: All of you know that the Secretary is the officer who does the work and there are times In the year when he Is away, and It Is necessary for someone to be on the job. We thought It wise to suggest this amend - ment. Gentlemen, what will you do with it? Moved and seconded that it be adopted. Motion carried. tl </seg>

Article 2u( the lly-haws rua'du at present: "The payment of five dollars at any one time shall exempt the member from the payment of annual dues." Proposed reading: "The payment of fifteen dol- ■ lars at any one time shall exempt the member from the payment of annual dues." The amendment to become effective February 1, 1930. MR. DAFT. Gentlemen, this raises the life membership from T5.00 to $15.00. I think it was the idea that when life membership fees were first instituted, they should be set aside in a fund, the income from which might be used for defraying expenses, but for a number of years, the life membership as well as the membership money was spent and a few years ago we found ourselves with a number of life members and the money paid in and ho income from it. We decided that with a larger life membership fee, we could in time build up a considerable fund. It Is up to the members to decide. What will you do with this amendment? This becomes effective February 1, 1930. If some of you are Scotch, you can still get In for J5.00. The annual membership dues are $1.00. Life membership at the present time is $5.00. Do I hear a motlonT Motion made and seconded that the amendment be adopted. Motion carried. MR. DAFT. Now, gentlemen, the next matter is the report of the resolution committee. Bob, is your committee ready to report? 808. It is not. MR. DAFT. This committee will report tomorrow night at the banquet. MR. CROWE. There was one dissenting vote in the adoption of the second amendment, but it was E. W. Frost, and I know he was just fooling because he has already handed me his dues, and not only that, he has paid annual dues in this association for the past twenty-five years, which is a record that is not held by many. MR. DAFT. The next matter of business is the election or officers. I appointed, before the meeting, a nominating committee of which Mr. A. O. Buschow is chairman and the other members are J. B. Higgins and R. E. Fortna. MR. BUSCHOW. Your committee begs to make the following nominations for officers and directors of the Nebraska State Dairy - men's Association: . </seg>

            <seg id="p310">REPOKT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE RETORT OP THE SECRETARY It is believed that' many people are not entirely familiar with the broad scope of the work of this association and for that reason the space allotted to the report of the secretary will be utilized in pointing out some of the work done by the association during the past year. The first event of major importance after the 1928 annual meet - ing of the association was the annual high school judging contest sponsored by the College of Agriculture and more directly the De - partment of Dairy Husbandry for the dairy contests. This association assists in the success of these contestants by awarding a trophy cup and five medals in the dairy cattle judging contest, six medals in the dairy products scoring contest and two medals in the Babcock testing contest. One hundred and twenty-seven students representing Smith- Hughes schools competed in these contests this year. Each year the association prepares exhibit material suitable for use at county fairs and other agricultural meetings throughout the state. This material is Bent to county agents, dairy herd improve - ment association testers and other interested persons through the co - operation of the Extension Service « the University of Nebraska. This year seven such exhibits were prepared and distributed, as shown by the schedule below. ■■■'•.

An exhibit which in all probability reaches a larger group each year than any other is the one prepared for the Nebraska State Fair and located In the northeast corner of Agricultural Hall.

Lawritson attended 333 meetings for the discussion of dairy subjects, 202 devoted to calf club work, 18 to the organization of herd improve - ment associations, 67 for judging demonstrations and 46 for general dairying. There were 18,625 people in attendance at these meetings. Nine hundred seventy-eight farm visits were made, 463 for in - struction and demonstrations to dairy calf club members, 373 on general dairy problems and 142 in connection with herd improvement association work which resulted in signing 57 members who enrolled 661 cows. The society received 2,600 requests for service through the office. One thousand three hundred sixty-nine were disposed of by corre - spondence, 765 by personal conference and 566 by telephone. The society assisted 281 Nebraska breeders and club members In purchasing 472 foundation animals. One hundred fifty-seven animals were purchased from 62 Nebraska breeders. The cattle purchased included 172 calves, 42 purebred sires and 258 cows and heifers. Of the 42 purebred sires, only one Holstein and 8 Guernseys were imported from other states. In addition to these direct purchases the society assisted a number of Nebraska breeders in locating and selecting several hundred additional animals. The society considers contagious, abortion a serious menace to the dairy industry and is doing everything possible to help control and prevent, its . spread. Young stock under breeding age is rarely affected with abortion. In the future the society will confine its cattle purchases to club calves, open heifers under breeding age and mature animals that pass the blood test. SIRE PURCHASES It 1b generally recognized that Nebraska can make substantial improvement in her dairy, industry through . the more general use of good purebred sires. During 1929, the society has given considerable time to the selection and purchase of 42 purebred sires for Nebraska breeders. In purchasing sires, attention is given to type, breeding </seg>

Holstein sire, whose dam has produced 723 pounds butterfat in 365 days as Junior two year old. His sire's dam has produced 1,140 pounds butterfat in a year. •'■'•• , II.' Guernsey bull, whose dam produced 774 pounds butterfat in a year as a four year old and his sire's dam has a yearly record of 831 pounds butterfat. . III. Proven Guernsey bull; whose first five daughters to freshen produced an average of 502 pounds butter - fat as two year olds. This bull's dam also has yearly production record of 774 pounds butterfat. With 1930, the society is starting a purebred sire campaign to extend over a period of years with the purpose of encouraging the greater use of good purebred sires. DAIRY HERD IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATIONS The society, in cooperation with the Extension Dairy Specialist of the College of Agriculture and County Extension Agents' during 1020, organized five additional herd improvement associations with 132 members testing 1,513 additional cows. This brings the total to 28 associations with 684 members testing 0,867 cows. The live new asso - ciations are located in Buffalo, Custer, Gage-Jefferson, Johnson, Otoe and Valley counties. . The average production of all cows tested in dairy herd improve - ment associations in Nebraska during the past year was 7,806 pounds of milk, which is an average increase of 186 pounds per cow over the previous year and is 70 per cent greater than the average of Ne - braska cows. The average annual Income over feed cost per cow enrolled in dairy herd improvement associations the past year was $96.00. The average Nebraska cow returns but $41.00 above cost of feed. In other words, the average cow in dairy herd improvement work in Nebraska is 133 per cent more efficient in milk production than is the average Nebraska cow. BOYS AND GIRLS CALF CLUBS During 1929, twenty-five new dairy calf clubs were organized with 175 members. The total number of clubs for 1929 waB 98 with a membership of 877. This is a 25 per cent increase over 1928. One hundred seventy-two club calves for Nebraska boys and girls were purchased by the society during 1929. These calves were pur - chased principally for new members, a few going to old members desiring to make replacements or develop two club calves. Forty-one </seg>

Nebraska competed at the National Dairy Show at St. Louis last October with a demonstration team, judging team and an exhibit of dairy calves. This is the first year that Nebraska club calves have been entered in the National. Demonstration ' There were 26 states represented in the dairy demonstration con - test. Nebraska was represented by two brothers, Richard and Earl Johnson, of Fremont. In very keen competition these boys won fourth place with their demonstration on "The Construction of a Standard Dairy Stall." Dairy Cattle Judging Twenty-seven states had each entered a judging team in this con - test. Nebraska was represented by three boys from Lancaster county, Elmer Young, Havelock (age 19 years), Wm. Hartz, Cheney (age 18 years) and Lawrence Liebers, Lincoln (age 15 years). The Nebraska boys won first on Holstelns and ranked second in judging all breeds. Showmanship In competition with 167 club members from 15 states, Elmer Young placed second and Lawrence Liebers third in the Guernsey showmanship contest. In the open contest where the five best showmen from each breed entered Elmer Young won seventh and X,awrence Liebers tenth. Calf Club Show Although this was the first time that Nebraska showed at the National in competition with the best from other states, she placed in the money in every class entered. Valda Malicky and her brother Marvin, both of Barneston, exhibited their eight months old Holstein calves. • . Valda had won first and grand champion at the State Fair and Marvin had stood third in the class. At the National In very keen competition in a class of 2 6, Valda placed tenth and Marvin twelfth. Guernseys: Delbert Egger of Sprague exhibited calf under a year old. Kenneth Olson, of College View, calf under a year. Melvin Frohn, yearling heifer. Elmer Young, Havelock, cow over 2 years old; Lawrence Liebers, Lincoln, yearling heifer and cow over 2 years. In the calf class, Delbert Egger won tenth and Kenneth Olson eleventh.

In addition to the club calves, two of the boys, Elmer Young and .Lawrence Liebers, entered their yearling Guern - sey bull in the open class where he was fn competition with the best yearling Guernsey bulls in America. He won ninth in a class of 12. The success of Nebraska's club work at the National was largely due to the effective work and personal interest of W. H. Brokaw, Director of Extension; L. I. Frisbie, state club leader; J. F. Purbaugh, county agent of Lancaster county; L. H. Daft, president of Nebraska State Dairymen's Association and representatives of the Nebraska Dairy Development Society. The expenses of transportation and travel of the club members to the National Show at St. Louis were met by contributions of a group of Omaha business men and the Lincoln Chamber of Commerce sup - plementing the money prize awards gained by the boys at the show. INCREASE CONSUMPTION OP DAIRY PRODUCTS The society Is actively cooperating with the National Dairy Coun - cil in a nation-wide campaign to increase the consumption of dairy products. This campaign is conducted over the radio, through the press, by advertisements, general publicity at meetings and demon - strations. Scientific authorities make it clear that the increased use of dairy products, milk, butter, cheese and ice cream, will do more for indi - vidual health and community prosperity than any other single factor in food consumption. A prosperous dairy industry is inseparably linked with the finan - cial progress of the community. The following comparison shows the present per capita consump - tion of dairy products and the increase recommended by the food scientists in the interest of health. Present consumption Science Recommends 22% of Food Dollar Increased to 83% of Food Dollar Milk 56.5 gals. Per capita ...... 90.4 gals. Butter 17.6 lbs. Per capita 28.17 lbs. Ice Cream 2.63 gals.

            <seg id="p359">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION THE THREE CARDINAL PRINCIPLES OF EFFICIENT DAIRYING By M. D. Munn, President, National Dairy Council I. Increased Efficiency in Production. II. Higher Quality of Products. III. Enlarge Consumptive Demand in the interest of Health, Use Liberal Quantities of Butter and Other Dairy Products. In his address to the Society at its annual meeting in Lincoln on January 9th, Mr. Munn discussed these three subjects in the order named: First — More Efficient Production — The dairy farmers of this country are losing more than half a billion dollars a year on their dairy cows' as a result of cow inefficiency. It has been conclusively demon - strated, through cow testing associations, herd improvement organiza - tions, as well as net results obtained by many farmers who have already adopted scientific practices, that the same amount of milk now being produced can be secured with two-thirds of the present number of cows if these. cows are built up to the efficiency which dairy herd improvement work has shown can be accomplished by better breeding, feed and care. Second — Quality Improvement — Many careful estimates show that the poor quality of much milk and cream is costing the dairy farmers of this country another hundred million dollars a year. This loss comes through lack of care of fluid milk, resulting in sour milk and ! off flavors, together with low grade of cream. The loss is equal to '■ ' one-seventh of the annual interest on our national debt. Most of this tremendous loss now sustained by dairy farmers can be saved by proper care and attention to the product after it is taken from the cow. Third — Increasing Consumptive Demand — Increasing the consump - tion of dairy products is a problem In which the dairy farmer hlmseir is most vitally interested. It is estimated that at present twenty-two cents of the average consumer dollar is expended for dairy products. Leading scientists and food authorities states that thirty-five cents of ! every consumer's dollar should be expended for milk and its pro - ducts in the interest of child growth and adult health and efficiency. Science has placed on the doorstep of this Industry an enormous op - , ■ portunity. \ ■ The dairy Industry has a necessity for and food value in its pro - ducts not possessed by most other foods.. How to get this necessity and food value fixed in the consumer's mind is the greatest problem confronting- this industry today. We must educate the consuming public to the vital importance of dairy products in the human diet and to the fact that it is good economy to spend thirty-five cents of the food dollar for dairy products. </seg>
            <seg id="p360">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE . The farmer should at this time and continuously use liberal amounts of butter and all other dairy products, not only in the interest of the health of his own family but of his own pocketbook and the prosperity of his community. SniM-rior Value of Dairy Products The following chart issued by the National Dairy Council sum - marizes a report of result of experiments conducted by the .London Medical Research Council of England, in which a colony of 220 boys were studied during a period of twelve months: OasicOid Milk Buffer Margarine impGtininl/ll&amp;ghtperty eaeica&amp; Milk duttlr tergsrine teragtlncrminltyhliw With the addition of one pint of milk per day to the. usual or basic diet, which in - cluded meat, fish, and other elements. 41 of the boys' average Bain in weight increased from 3.85 pounds to 6.98 pounds. 81 per cent, and their average increase in height advanced from 1.84 Inches to 2.63 inches, 13 per cent.

            <seg id="p362">ACTIVITIES OF THE HOME ECONOMICS SECTION OF ORGANIZED AGRICULTURE The aim of the association is to sponsor a program that wil be of interest and value to the rural homemakers of Nebraska. In order to reach a greater number of these homemakers the program of work for the 1929-1930 meeting was made to include four different phases: 1. Program for Home Economics Section of Organized Agricul - ture. 2. Recognition of leadership by awarding pins to the county chairmen of the home demonstration project work. 3. Financing recreation program for Mothers' Vacation Camps. 4. Assisting by sponsoring trips to the National 4-H Club Con - gress to winners of home economics judging contests.

            <seg id="p363">HOME ECONOMICS SECTION OF ORGANIZED AGRICULTURE On Tuesday, January 6th, the twenty-fifth annual meeting of the Home Economics Section of Organized Agriculture was opened. The first meeting began at 9:30 with Mrs. S. P. Davis of Syracuse, the president, presiding. Miss Mabel Zimmerman sang two numbers "When Honey Sings an Old Time Song," and "An Old Refrain." Miss Verna Lawrltson served as accompanist for Miss Zimmerman. Rev. W. B. Bancroft of the Temple Baptist Church pronounced the invocation. After the president's greetings. Dr. D. D. Whitney of the Uni - versity of Nebraska spoke on Our Inheritance. He used several charts to illustrate points made In his discussion. "Life is a continuous stream .from time Immemorial,' said Dr. D. D. Whitney, in his talk. "All living things are 'chips off the old block. 1 " "Heredity is regulated by natural laws,' he explained. "It is something over which we have no control. We are made up of units or characteristics, and since each parent can pass on to us only a half of their characteristics, it Is a matter of chance what we shall inherit. This accounts for the difference between brothers and sisters. Parents can only give about one-half of what they have to their children. A scientist has figured out that 17,000,000 combinations of characteristics can be inherited." Even tho we can not choose our inheritance. Dr. Whitney says we can select the best qualities in our natures and develop them, weeding out the undesirable traits. This is the function of education and child training. At 10:45 the group divided into smaller sections for the five round tables which were held in various rooms of the Home Eco - nomics building. Subjects for the round tables were: Pictures in the Home, Miss Bess Steele. Emotional Habits of Young Children, Miss Ruth Staples. Next Steps in Extension, Miss Mary-Ellen Brown. Some Studies in Kerosene Stoves, Mrs. Edna Snyder. Play in your Home and Community, Miss Ella Gardner. A brief report of each of the round table discussions follow. Pictures in the Home The discussion in this round table was based on a group of forty pictures hung on the walls of the room. The collection was sent by the American Federation of Arts and included works of old and of modern masters. </seg>
            <seg id="p364">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Points considered in the discussion were, what makes -a picture fine, where could these pictures be used, how should they be framed, where should they be hung. A brief summary of various points is given. The collection of pictures was divided in the following groups: I. Landscapes. II. Dutch Masters Pictures. Good for home because they" have an intimate feeling about them. They are not of beautiful people but peo - ple we like to have about us. The family should be surrounded by pictures to the liking of the family. III. Rembrant. IV. Decorative Art Pictures. Decorative art pictures are nof done in a naturalistic way. The painter goes out and takes notation on what he is going to paint, then comes back and paints it in the flat. Painter — Oornwell. In homes look for color that is soft and has feeling of refinement. V. Pictures of Bouquets. If used at all we must be very careful. Better to have a real bouquet than a picture of one. If we use bouquet pictures be very careful and do not put it on wall paper that has flowers in it. VI. Still Life. Great care again must be used if we have pictures of fruit, etc. VII. Portraits. Such as Reynolds, "Little Count Althorp," Titian, "Por - trait of Man" and "Sackerville Children," De Crodi, "Madonna Adoring the Child." General Rules for Framing and Hanging Pictures Pictures should be chosen according to the room in which they are to be placed and the preference of the persons who will occupy that room. We want them to be harmonious in subject, character and color with the room in which they are hung. Pictures light in value usually need a mat. Dark values do not need the mat. Oil paint pictures never have mats, always framed close, therefore reproductions framed close, too. Heavy gold frames best for portraits. Gold should be toned clown. Frame can have considerable depth and width. Character of frame should be in harmony with the character of the picture. (Example, delicate oil painting in narrow frame.) The picture itself thould always be dominate, not the frame. In hanging pictures they should become a part of the wall. Dp flot tilt pictures. Wires should not be used on small pictures. </seg>
            <seg id="p365">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION Always hang pictures In relation to furniture. Hang picture over desk so it groups itself with furniture. Kodak pictures usually framed with mat and narrow black frame. Height of pictures should be slightly above eye level of person standing. The bottom or top edge of pictures should be in line, can't have both. If we have a davenport with regular line at top, . pictures above it should be in a straight line. * More use can be made of fabrics behind pictures. This may be a means of making pictures appear larger. ■. Suggested Pictures for Rooms Living room— landscapes and fine portraits. Dining room — Fruit arid flower pictures if well done, land - scapes. Library — Etchings, lithographs, engravings, master portraits. Bed room — Personal likes of occupants should be considered, friends, travel pictures, fantastic prints. Nursery — Those concerned with their activities, birds, chil - dren's pictures, very simple. Kitchen — Do we use them as extensive as we might? One that a person enjoys a lot may be used. Emotional Habits of Young Children "Because children must learn to get along with others, to be - come agreeable members of society, it is important to begin early in correct habit training," said Miss Ruth Staples, director of the nursery school, in her talk on "Emotional Habits of Young Children." Some things, such as regularity, can be taught early. She outlined four important practices for habit formation. It is important to allow plenty of time and opportunity for children to learn things, so that they will have time to experiment a little; second, to repeat over and over again the same thing, so that the habit becomes fixed; third, to watch the effect of the habit on the child, and last, to watch the effect of suggestions from adults in his habit formation. Next Steps In" Extension In this round table Miss Mary-Ellen Brown had those present express their opinions about the possibility of having a new project on The Homemaker Herself. Various names for the project were discussed and the sentiment seemed to be in favor of the name given above. A discussion followed upon what the women would like to have In the various lessons of the project. Suggestions were made to have it include personality, family and community relationships and health. Another important topic discussed was leadership. Many seemed to feel that it was well to have one new project leader each year. If this plan Is followed then there will be one old leader and </seg>

The study of kerosene stoves was undertaken for the follow - ing reasons: 1. Rural women have to depend chiefly upon kerosene as a fuel during the summer months. 2. A stove is a necessity in every home. 3. Little that is definite is known concerning the various types of kerosene stoves. B. Parts of the study. 1. Heating speed of various types of kerosene stoves. 2. Thermal efficiency and oil consumption of various types of kerosene stoves. 3. Practical cooking of foods from standard menus 4 " fyperorburrr" 011 ° f ° n Uten8lU fr ° m Varl6us 5. Relation of diameter of utensil to diameter of burner. 6. Effect of draft on oil consumption. C.

The method of studying washing machine? was explained, but as yet we have no results. Play in Your Home and Community Miss Ella Gardner outlined games for home and community part - ies picnics, methods for making bazaars successful and plays for dramatic entertainment. She stated that one act plays were best for amateurs and that games should work up to a climax in the evening, and that each game should have its individual climax so that the play - ers would want more later The Tuesday afternoon program was opened with music by Lyle Welch Lowell Boomer, William Green and Kenneth Foust, students from the University School of Music. They played "Petit Quartet, "Funnicula" and a group of folk songs, "A Merry Tune," When You and I Were Young Maggie," and "Sweet and Low." The first number on the program was the 4-H club demonstration. "Shoes for the School Girl" was the topic chosen by Mildred and Helen Myers for their team demonstration which won first place in their county, first In the clothing class in the state and grand cham - pionship Home Economics team in competition with all other teams at the Nebraska State Fair. Mildred and Helen come from Eddyville, Custer county, and rep - resent 5,000 clothing club girls enrolled in 4-H clubs during 1929. Winning championship in the clothing division at the State : Fairen - titled them to the prize trip to Chicago to attend the eighth annual Loys and Girls Club Congress where they competed with thirteen states for the prize trip to Paris. June. 1930. This trip was offered to the thirteen central states by the Chicago Mail Order Company. The Nebraska team placed fourth in this contest. In their demonstration they take up five points: (1) The struc - ture of the human foot. (2) Aliments. (3) Exercises. (4) How to walk, (5) Selection, thus treating the health as well as the clothing phase of foot wear. After proving that a shoe for a school girl with normal feet should have a broad round toe, a low broad heel, a flexible shank, a straight Inner line and a low cut the young ladles selected shoes suitable for sport, school, afternoon and formal wear. Mildred is seventeen years of age and Helen Is sixteen. They are both freshmen in the College of Agriculture this year. After this demonstration Miss Mary Rokahr. Extension Economist in Home Management, from the United States Department of Agri - culture, spoke on Farm Home Standards. Miss Rokahr said: " 'The plane of living Is what one actually does Bpend and it may vary according to a great many circumstances which have little or no relation to what one should spend in order to achieve a certain </seg>
            <seg id="p368">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE socially sanctioned end, i. e., to the standard of living.' " — L. L. Bernard. ■ "We often use carelessly the terms standards, ideal, model, and other words that set up in our minds a concept of the thing we are attempting to visualize. The old story flashes into my mind of the definition of a model husband — "model" according to the dictionary meaning "A small imitation of the real thing." The dictionary is kinder when we consult it for a definition of the word "standard." "It tells us that a standard is a gauge, test, or mode by which a method or thing may be judged. The analysis of the term standard in relationship to the rural home may at first thought seem ah in - correct approach, since we say at once that our standards will not be the same in any one family. When we think of Farm Home Standards as a gauge or test by which we may judge farm homes in a given area, then it seems logical to attempt to set up such standards. "Standards are set up in every line of endeavor. As you prob - ably know the United States Government maintains the Bureau of Standards in Washington where hundreds of trained people are con - tinually doing research work to set up standards for us for manu - lactured articles from soap to automobile brake linings and tacks. This work aims at prevention of duplication, wise use of materials and supplying standard quality goods to the consumer. Recently I had the privilege of sitting in at one of the conferences where a committee of men and women from various interested organizations set up the standards for patterns for boys' blouses. The committee agreed on how measurements were to be taken and the number of inches for the length of sleeves, back, and other measurements ac - cording to the age. When these standards were accepted the manu - facturers of boys' blouses followed them and did not drop below them, and the mother who purchases boys' blouses knows that all manu - facturers' standards for boys' blouses are the same. Almost every article that we use daily in our homes has been subjected to standards of which we are unconscious. "In your own mind the thought probably arises, 'I can under - stand the reasons for having standards for articles, weight, and the like, but why farm home standards?' How may we judge how suc - cessfully we are living in our rural homes today if we have no stand - ards by which we may test or judge our living? If we set up stand - ards we may judge better our own progress and in some instances it may be an incentive for us to raise our own standards. As we live year by year, if we have some standard by which we may judge our progress, it will assist in indicating our successes or failures. Standards guide us in doing things the right way, but we must not as - sume that the standards we may indicate today will remain the same indefinitely. You may come back next year and change the stand - ards you set up today. Farm home standards must not be static, but will of necessity change, sometimes very slowly- </seg>
            <seg id="p369">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION "For the sake of ease In discussion, Farm Home Standards may bo divided into three groups: Physical farm home standards, economic farm home standards, and social farm home standards. "Physical farm home standards may be divided into two groups — those that pertain to us as human beings and those applied to the house in which we live. • The physical standards we have set up for ourselves you are so familiar with that you will recognize them as they are mentioned. For Instance, the food habits score card which sets forth the standard of a pint of milk for every person, fruit once a day, green leafy vegetables at least three times a week, and so on. We may or may not come, up to the standard the nutrition peo - ple have set up for us but there it is for us to gauge our short comings if we wish to eat for good health. To assist mothers the standard for a well nourished child has been developed. The standard &amp;ays the child's skin, hair, nails, ears, mouth, should have a certain appearance, tests for posture and bone growth are set forth so that a mother may look over her child and see for herself If the 'outward manifestations of health' Indicate that her child Is not falling below the standard set by physicians and nutritionists. Home management specialists have evolved a similar standard or score card by which the rural home maker may judge her own personal efficiency and physical and mental well being. "Let us turn to the Nebraska farm house and see if we can set up a standard even tho it Is a crude one, of the things that should be In and make up a Nebraska farm house. It may not Include the things we have, nor all we should like to have, nor is it based on what we can do without, but rather should it contain the items that will develop 'a home environment of confidence, self respect, and a sense of social equality.' It is the standard that the majority of us should not fall below. "Oregon Extension Service has developed a check list of things a farm home standard should Include. Let- us use it as a basis. Nebraska Farm Home Standards Check the Item "yes" If you consider that the Nebraska Farm Home Standard should include this Item: </seg>

These standards vary from one section of the United States and even one part of a state to another. An illustration is the standard a group of women In a western state set regarding the number of rooms in the house and the use of those rooms. This group in fairly new country with many small children in the home recommended as a standard that the kitchen and dining room be combined as one room while the children were small, but later when the children could help with the work the combination should be that of dining room, living room. A group of eastern farm home makers thought that standard low and they recommended a separate kitchen and dining room. Some day the western group will change their standard. In the meantime let us not make our standards so high we can not reach them. Let us discuss the economic farm home standards next. "To simplify the discussion on the economic home standards we will consider only those pertaining to the cash income of the farm family. Following the plan outlined above the Extension Service staffs in a number of states have thru conferences with farm men and women made recommendations and set up economic standards. While the men discussed which crops to raise and how a larger in - come might be secured, the women discussed the minimum cash in - come that a farm family of five in a given area needed, and how that money should be wisely expended. The value of such economic con - ferences based on fact information is three fold. First, it focuses the attention of both farm men and women on the farm as a whole, and one of the most important problems of any home is "Where does </seg>
            <seg id="p372">Report ov Nebraska state board op agriculture the money come from and where is It going?" Second, if an analysis of the cash income of the farm reveals that it does not come up to the standard set by the farm women and men as necessary, it logically follows that different farm .and home management practices must result that will bring about the necessary amount. Third, it is a standard set up by farm people themselves and as such fits their own needs and desires as they see them. The following chart shows the result of the discussion on the minimum cash income for a farm family of five in five given areas: Reno. Powell, Aberdeen, Eastern Item Nevada Wyo. So. Dak. States Oregon Food $ 350 $ 360 $ 331 $ 450 $ 260 Clothing 350 360 495 . 400 300 Fuel and light 85 90 125 125 246 Operating expenses 275 100 200 150 Recreation 100 55 60 75 60 Education 175 - 110 165 110 128 Church &amp; charity_ 75 55 60 60 86 Health 150 60 53 100 150 Personal 140 _ 94 ■ _ 148 Tobacco Toilet articles Total $1,700 11,190 $1,583 $1,470 $1,378 "Life insurance, savings, and reduction of mortgage allowance standards varied from $130 to $350. The value of products furnished by the farm is not included in these cash incomes. "From available fact information in almost every area farm peo - ple knew that at the present time the farms were not producing the minimum amount that was recommended by the communities. The result was that for the women a study of household accounts and wise buying, and for the men a study of farm management and ways and means of securing a larger cash income to meet the needs. The recommendations of Brown Co., North Dakota, read as follows: ' " 'To provide an average farm family of five in Brown county with certain essentials for living, in addition to those furnished by the farm, the various women's committees of this conference de - termined that approximately $1,600 per year is required.' " 'A 320 acre farm was considered by the greatest number of farmers the minimum size In Brown county which could yield sufflient gross income to pay operating expenses, overhead, and provide the $1,600 budgeted by the women for living requirements. " 'Altho several types of farming may be followed on a 320 acre farm, the following were considered essentials for all: a. Follow definite rotations. b. Have about one-fourth of crop acreage in cash crops. </seg>
            <seg id="p373">Nebraska home economics association c. Keep sufficient livestock to consume all feed crops grown. d. Secure yields 20 per cent above ten year average for the county. e. Keep better than average quality livestock.' "What figure would you Nebraska homemakers arrive at as your minimum cash Income? Let me warn you not to jump into this hastily but take plenty of time for discussion and gather together all the available facts you can secure, and then considering each item in detail, arrive at the total amount. This would be an interesting piece of work for your home -demonstration clubs to discuss at your meet - ings this winter.' "After all our emphasis on physical and economic standards, per - haps some of you are thinking but 'how important are such standards in comparison with the standards of the . family as a social unit and as human beings?' I agree that 'What profiteth it a man if he gain the whole world and yet lose his own soul.' In the same way, what jToflteth it us if we add the physical improvements to our home l and yet lose or leave out the aesthetic, spiritual and social values? Here are standards that are much harder to set up than those we have been discussing. Some are more tangible than others. What shall we say regarding music standards, the piano, victrola, radio, other musical instruments and music lessons? What in regard to books, magazines, and newspapers? What in regard to the automobile and its use for pleasure and recreation? What in regard to the care and guidance of the children? What in regard to mother's, father's and children's vacation trips? What in regard to the celebration of an - niversaries? What in regard to friendships? What in regard to wholesome family relationships so that each member may grow? What in regard to the church and religious life? What in regard to the relationships to the community? What In regard to the social aspects within the home, -the entertainment of guests? What in regard to the attitudes of the family members toward the technique of house - keeping? "AH of these questions and many more could be asked regarding our social farm home standards. That they should be considered and set up in concrete form if possible all of us agree. How shall we go about it? In the form of a score card by which we may judge our short comings, or In the form of a check sheet by which we may say, yes or no, these standards should be maintained. Either way may prove helpful, or some of you may have a better way to suggest. " 'Rome was not built in a day' neither are farm home standards made over night. It is a long process thru many years. If setting up standards makes us more conscious of how far we have come and the progress we hope to achieve In the years to come, then It is worth while setting up such standards. The majority of farm homes in Nebraska should be able to attain whatever standard you as a group feel should be adequate to provide a farm home in which the IS </seg>

Conclusion (1) Standards for the farm home are tests or gauges by which we may judge our progress. . (2) The physical standards listed here pertain to the Nebraska farm house. (3) Economic standards may be set up thru a minimum cash Income for a farm family of five. (4) Social standards or attitudes are of most importance.

            <seg id="p377">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION music was given by Mrs. Altinas Tullis accompanied by Arlene Lar - son. She sang; "There 1b Ever a Song." "Night Song." "Prom the Cycle." "Moods by Ashford." Following the music, Miss Evelyn Metzger gave a demonstration on Attractive Room Arrangement. Miss Metzger said "We have all heard of some friend or other of ours as having a knack for doing things. That knack to some, of course, is natural and to others it is n. very conscious effort. We all understand the discord in music. We can sense It or hear it but when it comes to the use of color, form or texture In things, that appeal to the senses, we have a very hard thing to do. This, of course, is very psychological. Of course, we can become accustomed to discord, even bad odors, evil sounds and we do not even realize that they exist so that is one reason why when you make over your interior arrangement or change it in some new way or form, sometimes you do not like It at first even tho your judgment and good training tell you that it is right. You have so long been accustomed to the things in the old way that you are not accustomed to them after the change is made. I remember an ex - perience of this kind with a friend of mine. She had an interior decorator come to visit her. This decorator gave suggestions how to re-arrange her Interior. An old negro in the family was employed to come and Mrs. Clarke re-arranged Mrs. Williams' house. The negro was kept busy changing pictures and lugging things out. After Mrs. Clarke was gone Mrs. Williams sat down and looked at her house. Many of the familiar things were gone. It did not look natural. The next morning she put everything back the same as it was. She thought about it for a while and she said, 'Well, I wish I had left it that way for a little bit longer and talked to jay friends and other interior decorators about it.' It is true that if you do re-arrange your house according to good form after having studied the situation a little, you probably will not enjoy it at first. It will look queer to you. Those things have become so accustomed to being in those places in your mind that you are not contented with having it else - where. If. you study this arrangement for about a week and change it back to the old way, then you will like it in the new way. There is a psychological reason for that. There is a big thing in the things that are beautiful. That is harmony. While we do feel harmony In music sometimes we do not feel it so well in the physical sense. It will help if you can remember that harmony means that all of the big things in the situation should have something common and should have likeness and that many of the little things can be different. It is quite a simple thing and- yet you would be surprised to see how you can go astray it you do not study the situation. The reason why some of the things are varied is because things can not stand </seg>
            <seg id="p378">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE monotony. That is why when some people go to buy wall paper they are interested in the more figured paper. They like variety and they forget to realize that the figure is spreading over a large surface, con - sequently, that is a mistake that is very commonly made. There is no reason why we should not have figured wall paper but we should use it consistently and under certain conditions. This variety that we try to get is usually gotten by means of contrast and must be considered with the small things in' the room. If the things are too big they spoil the effect. "Variety is a thing that we have to have. It is because we have so much of it in nature. You will find that there is a certain amount ot likeness in nature that makes for the beauty and harmony. One example we can appreciate is the human hand. You will notice the similarity and difference in the fingers and thumb. And yet if there is even the slightest thing wrong, you will notice it. The slightest defect is very noticeable. There we have an example of having the greatest amount of variety and yet so much likeness that the thing is perfect in its unity and beauty. "The one thing that we have in the relationship to the furnish - ings of homes is the relationship or harmony between sizes. This harmony is concerned with shapes also. It is very difficult to put different kinds of shapes together. They ought to be similar shapes if they are large. We have harmony of dark and light. The room ought to be light with a few dark accents or dark with light accents. We also need harmony of ideas. We do not want to spoil a poster bed with shiny rayon. It is much nicer with home spun. So it is we have a harmony that runs thru everything, thru ideas, as well as shapes, forms, sizes, lights, darks, everything that is concerned with the interior of the room. The first thing of course to consider if you are not buying anything or changing the background, would be the furniture. If you want to experiment with what you get out of this talk after you get home you might start with your furniture. The larger pieces should be located in the center or near the center of the room. They should be placed to conform with the shape of the room if we are to have harmony. (Miss Metzger illustrated a room which one of her students re-arranged). This room had a doorway that led into the dining room and kitchen. It was a long room. It had two windows at one end and one big window. and then the front door and porch and stairway. In the room there was a day bed setting along one side, stove located in the center of the room so people could go around it, piano, which was cater corner the room oh one side, two rugs, big chair, pipe stand' and a big fern. After this girl went home ghe said to her mother, 'I wish you would let me re-arrange that room. Anyway, I would like to experiment with It. I believe if we set some of the pieces of furniture, parallel with the wall,, it would look better.' The stove arrangement could not be changed and the girl had to wait until her father came home so when he held up the </seg>
            <seg id="p379">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION stove she re-arranged the zinc plate. If we could get an airplane view of the room, probably the first arrangement would look a. lot worse than it did in the home. This wall over here I am going to draw it standing up. (Drawing of the wall with day bed under the win - dows with the cushions and chairs before It had been re-arranged). She not only bettered the situation by putting the big pieces in the middle and made a better' balance while here you see the balance was olT and did not make nearly as nice an arrangement. If things are placed around correctly you will find that the design of the furniture comes against the walls and it is much' better looking. One reason that this sort of arrangement results is not so much our fault as the fault of the man who built the house and made .the plans. If you use squared paper you can draw your rooms and make the arrangement plan to scale. When you start to build a house never accept the floor plan as suggested. Find out how big your furniture is and if you can not arrange your furniture properly, find out where the plan can be changed. And of course, you can get a much better ar - rangement. After the furniture Is arranged, we have the problem of arranging the pictures. Arrange the pictures after the furniture is placed. Oftentimes we can make different arrangements of table covers and curtains which will help the effect of the room. (Demon - strated the placing of table covers on gate leg tables, tables with drop leaves, and square tables.) There is another situation with tables where we have large square tables and put a light colored table cover on it. We have a light colored table cover on a dark table. You see the dark masses in here (points out the spot) spoil it and it would be very much better if this table cover was placed on the table so that the dark places of. the table show all the way around. By placing the table cover in this way, (demonstrates the position) if the table cover is small it is not so bad because it is more of a design. In the case of curtains when the curtains are tied back, if they can be separated in the center and moved back and held loosely by the backs, the design is very much nicer than if the curtains are pinched back from the center. "We have that, situation in the colonial tie-backs and with the criss cross curtains. It should be very sheer material and very sure that the lines come almost at right angles rather than diagonal. Ruffles always help to make harmony in the situation. If you want the rod to show, which many people are loathe to have, there is no reason why the rod should not show. There is nothing wrong about this. The top of the curtain is not a place to have ornaments. Tou can see how bad it looks. If It is over-emphasized it is bad. If it is moderate It is good. Sometimes you want to pull the curtains together and if they can be caught up to make a loop you will have a much better line than if they are stretched tight. If you wish a change in the curtains you will find that hanging drapes in perfectly vertical lines helps the living room. It gives the room dignity. Very </seg>
            <seg id="p380">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE orten the living room is very large and the drapes help to make the ceiling seem lower and this helps. In the case of pictures when we come to change the hanging of our pictures, the shape of the pic - tures should harmonize with the wall space. ' The shape of the wall in this case is vertical rather than horizontal, consequently you can see a picture of vertical dimensions. The thing to do if you do not have a picture that will fit the shape of the wall space will.be to eliminate the picture and gradually get some thing that will fit the wall space. Group pictures some times can be hung over the daven - port. The trouble is we have so many small pictures and not enough big ones. If you have a lot of small pictures and they go well to - gether, you can put the big one in the center and put the smaller ones on the end. In this case if the picture was bigger it would be hung with two strings from the molding. We also have a lack or harmony in sizes. There is no relationship between a large pic - ture and a small picture. The same is true with an over stuffed chair used with a smaller chair. After you have arranged your fur - niture, larger pieces in the center of the wall space, if your doors and windows are not a problem, then arrange your pictures and cur - tains and straighten up the table covers, there is the problem of arranging the smaller objects on the book cases and library tables. In the case of a large book case you might have a small object you want to put on this book case. Naturally, you put the larger object in the center and the smaller objects on the sides. A better balance is secured if the smaller objects are placed out from the center some - what. It gives more variety for our eye has a habit of stopping at every object it comes to. The principle of balance may be compared to a titter totter. If this object is very vivid and this small object is grayed, it is out of balance. There are different things we can use on a book case. This might be a bowl of bitter sweet, low bowl, a candle stick over here and you might have a small object over here and a small object over here. This might be composed of three or four things. A lot of little things should always be grouped, not scattered out over the whole surface. In the case of the library table there is some rather interesting things that should go there. If you have a large lamp you may place it in the center and if it is not so large you can place it to the side. Book ends, magazines and if you do not have magazines enough to do both "sides, a bowl of flowers or a bouquet of bitter sweet may be used. You might use a box, paper knife, and of course the table cover. These are a few things that come on the table. After this is arranged in this position, one thing that makes more for beauty of arrangement than anything else Is getting all the objects so that they are arranged for comfort. Place everything for comfort. If you come into a room and you feel that you would like to sit down and stay, then you can be pretty sure that the room is well arranged. If a room is arranged so that the big things are arranged first and the smaller things arranged next, you will feel that everything is in order. Decrease the size of the </seg>

People have a habit of getting chairs in the corner. Has a stuffy appearance. Never place a big piece of furniture up to the corner of a room." (Miss Metzger showed pictures to illustrate the Interior of rooms and designs of wall paper.) Mrs. Paul Whisenand, State Chairman of Rural Clubs and Rural Life, gave an interesting and optimistic view of the changing home of today. She spoke as follows: "In speaking of 'The Changing Home of Today' to this audience of Nebraska Farm Women, all references are made from the view - point of the Nebraska farm home. I was born on a farm, raised on a farm, married a farmer, and still live on a farm, so that makes me one of you in truth. "If the purpose of this talk was intended to fill you with alarm for the changing home of today, the wrong speaker has been chosen for I am not at all alarmed about our Nebraska farm homes, they are so far ahead of the homes of yesterday that there ia no compar - ison possible. The reason that we hear so much about our bad homes, bad children and indifferent parents Is merely due to the fact that all of the sensationally, bad things come to us in our papers and magazines because they are the things to be worked out and remedied. You have all heard of the news reporter to whom the editor gave the Instruction to bring in nothing but news, and upon being asked just what is news — gave this concrete example. 'If a dog bites a man that's not news, but if a man bites a dog, that's news.' Now you .can readily see why our good Nebraska homes oc - cupy no front space in our papers. Our happy homes are our great - est asset but they make dull reading. "I believe the greatest change in our changing home of today is in the status of the mother in the home. She was formerly merely the housekeeper, whose lack of suitable equipment 'kept her drudging from morning until night to get her work done, who was listed even in our government census as a person with 'no occupation.' In our next census she will be listed as a 'home maker,' and as an occupation none greater can be listed. You women who sometimes feel you are not of much importance, listen to this little verse: "To make homes; that Is what women are for; Homes make the town; towns make the city; Cities make the country; after all. Tho men and women make their homes It is the homes which make men and women. "Whether our national life .is great or mean — Whether our social activities are mature or stunted Whether our sons and daughters are moral or vicious Whether religion is possible or impossible — Depends upon the Home. </seg>
            <seg id="p382">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE "The second great change in our changing home of today is in the relation between the parent and the child. Father and mother used to sit upon a sort of throne from which they issued commands to their children. They expected and received Implicit obedience. The child never questioned the parents' wisdom. In our home of today we have lost this high spirit of reverence from our children it is of no use to expect implicit obedience because we wouldn't receive it if we did, but we have something far more valuable in its place; in a spirit of loving comradeship we stand side by side with our arms around each other; we respect our child's individuality and ideas as he respects ours; we work out our problems together - we are PALS. "In loking over a recent Pictorial Review I found the following article which I bring to you. •If a new Moses appeared today and went into the mountains to bring forth a tablet of stone, there is a possibility that this tablet would be for womankind. For so complicated and complex have housekeeping and homemaking become in these strenuous twentieth cent - ury days that unless a woman formulates rules for her - self and adheres to them she verily falls beside the road - . aide. 'The commandments upon the tablet would undoubtedly read about as follows: 1. Thou shalt keep thy health so as to enjoy the life that has been given thee. 2. Thou shalt not nag nor complain. 3. Thou shalt not worry about matters which thou . canst not change. 4. Thou shalt not clean and dust all the time. 5. Thou shalt love thy husband and children more than thy house and its furnishings. 6. Thou shalt know food values and how to prepare and serve meals. 7. Thou shalt have a hobby and ride it hard. 8. Thou shalt run thy house to please thyself and thy family, and not thy neighbors. 9. Thou shalt have labor saving devices. 10. Thou shalt not drive the auto from the back seat.' "I have very little fault to find with our Nebraska homemakers but I am sorry to say that many have that terribly bad habit of feeling sorry for themselves' which is one of the worst and most useless habits in the world— that habit of running into endless repeti - tion of the unpleasant details of our work. You all know the woman who comes into a club (or other meeting) with a voluminous sigh </seg>
            <seg id="p383">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION and a tale of woe like this: 'O dear, I thought I'd never get here. I had so much to do this morning, the children had popped corn last night and it was all over everything. Then the dishes, and the chickens and O, dear, that awful cream separator that I have to wash every day of the year. How I Sate it and to top it off John brought in two extra men for dinner.' How sad! Still you will notice she was able to get to club and chances are that nine-tenths of the women present had done as much or more than she. Let us keep the un - pleasant details of our 'jobs' to ourselves, they are of no interest to others and most boresome. "Another thing which we rural women maybe slack in is in not appreciating the beauty around us. What is so beautiful as our Ne - braska in June when our wheat is green; our corn is green; our grass is green; our trees are green; and every green a different shade, a veritable 'Symphony of Green.' "Be your home ever so humble you can make it beautiful, put a chicken wire fence around it and plant shrubs around your house and flowers in your garden. Did you ever try the gladioli? It is a bulb that brings forth a flower in your garden as beautiful as if it were reared in a green house, plant them right along with your onions if you wish and remember that 'gladioli make you glad' and you will have onions for your salads and gladioli for your souls. "Then the beauty of the little calves and pigs, the fluffy baby chickens, how our cousins from the cities rave over them, while we accept' them so casually. Many of our city folk would gladly ex - change with us if they only could. "They dream of farms, those city folk, Who know the great town's heavy yoke, Who on their flesh feel every stroke Of trade's unflagging whips; They dream of farms and maple trees. Of clover fields and drowsy bees, As those sad exiles far from seas Dream still of ships. They dream of farms, of soil and sod Where their forefathers, farmers, trod And shared the mystery with God Of giving green things birth They long to leave the city shrill Where souls are ground in greed's great mill They want to find and own and till Their share of earth. And we who long have had in fee What they so yearn for ceaselessly We hold our treasure carelessly, And even half despise. </seg>

The little farmhouse warm with light, That seems, to hoBts who dream tonight, A paradise." — Mary Carolyn Davies. "And lastly this little verse from the Fanner's Wife: "When but a child I marveled at the stars And vainly tried their mystery to unfold Until I found that God was living- there The mystery then was solved, the secret told They were not merely stars. Oh, surely not! Those twinkling lights high In the heaven's blue! They were the windows of God's boundless house, With bits of His own glory shining thru.

            <seg id="p385">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION family. But if individual family records are lacking considerable help and guidance can be got from the records of others. "The figures I have here are taken from the spending records of 226 farm families. After the production expenses were deducted these records showed that 46 per cent of the farm Income was spent for living, 43 per cent for investments and 10 per cent for automo - biles. The competition within the expenditures is between living ex - penses and Investment expenses. The tendency is to keep living ex - penses down to a minimum so that investments may be greater. It is the ever present competition between the present and the future. As incomes Increase the proportion spent for living decreases while that spent for investment increases. Within the amount spent for living 30 .per cent went for food, 20 per cent for clothing, 22 per cent for household and operation, 10 per cent for health and 18 per cent for miscellaneous, Including education, recreation, etc. As the income increases consumption in all these items increases but the proportion spent for food, clothing, household, and health decline while the proportion spent for miscellaneous items increased. This shows that as income increases farm families are very anxious to increase their consumption of these non-material goods which add to the contentment and happiness of the family just as surely as do the material goods consumed. "In using any such figures as these it is necessary to remember that they are only a guide, and no spending plan should be taken too literally. Unless your plan is flexible, it will have little value, for changes will always be necesary. And if you make such a flexible budget and keep records most of you will find it interesting and amusing, as well as profitable. Indeed, the fun to be had from such budgeting Is one of the strongest arguments in Its favor. The whole family- can enter into the plans, the income spending for the family will become a family affair with every member of the family co - operating."

            <seg id="p386">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Three round table discussions of Tuesday were repeated and two others were added, 'Selection of Equipment for the Farm Home, 1 by Miss Mary Mason, and 'Demonstration on Meat Selection ' by Mrs Louise Genung Hall. Miss Mary Mason, head of the equipment division of the home economics department, advised the women to select utensils accord - ing to the needs and size of their families and the storage space available. Too much equipment is a burden and too little is a handi - cap. Oftentimes we waste time using a percolator which will not stand straight and yet hesitate to throw it away because it will work. The right utensils promote efficient habits of work.' Miss Margaret Fedde, head of the home economics department presided at the afternoon meeting. A group of students from the Gutzmer Vocal Studio gave the afternoon musical program which con - sisted of numbers from two operettas, "The Mountebanks" and the "Morning of the Year." These were sung by a quintet composed of Mesdames Harry MacGinnis, Hal Minor, Kate Miller, H. A. McNerney and Arthur Plerson, with solos by Mr. Lee Wilcox, tenor, and Mr' William Stiverson, baritone. Mrs. Fleta Graham Zlegenbeln accom - panied the singers. Miss Rokahr then discussed Home Management Ideals as follows: "None enjoy life so little as those who have nothing to do." "Since the central theme of the Home Economics program this year is 'Ideals for the Home of Today,' it seems fitting to consider the Home Management Ideals. "At the present time greater stress is being placed on the home - maker as a home manager than ever before, especially is this true in Extension Service work. To those of us who have been In Extension Service work since its beginning and have watched its progress from year to year, the development has been logical. We started first with duties nearest at hand, preparation of food followed by preservation of food; then many .years work with clothing and then a more de - tailed study of foods and nutrition. Kitchen improvement followed soon after, gradually spreading to general home Improvement, in - cluding the outside of the home. Slowly into the Extension program has crept an attempt at a more detailed analysis of the real objectives of home making. "Recently It was my. privilege to listen to a series of discussions on teaching methods by Dr. Krause of Cornell University. Dr. Krause pointed out that the kind of educational changes that we might make are, namely, in attitudes, knowledges and skills. In our home man - agement work we have done much with the home management skills Kitchen improvement, use of labor saving devices, best laundry meth - ods, good cleaning practice, all emphasize skills. The. trend of home management work seems to be toward the focusing of attention upon knowledges that will help us to make wise choices and changes in </seg>
            <seg id="p387">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION nttitudes that will assist us as successful home managers to handle the social needs within and outside of our homes. "Miss Van Rensselaer of Cornell University has aptly worded the scope of home management as follows: 'Home Management is the meeting place of all activities which center In home life. It Is a study of the environmental conditions affecting the home and a concentra - tion on the technique of housekeeping, the advantage of which is, first, to free the time and save the energy of the household members for the essentials of living; second, to make more desirable homes on available incomes. Household management Is concerned with the physical plant or environmental conditions in connection with the selection, care and cost of food, clothing, housing, furnishings and equipment, as well as the control of education, benevolences, recrea - tion, and health of the family. It is a philosophy .or the attitude of the family members toward the technique of housekeeping, the rela - tion of family members to each other. A good philosophy does not come from running away from routine, but in bringing Intelligent Interest to bear upon it. It is to simplify and dignify every day duties." "It Is very hard for a person whose occupation it Is to look at home making In a general way to keep his feet on the ground and his conception of home management In Its most practical aspects. In consequence I turn for guidance and advice to home makers who face the every day problems. Their answer to my questions regard - ing 'What are the outstanding home management problems?' is 'We manage the problem of. the preparation of food, laundry, cleaning, and baking fully well. They become matters of routine, but where we need help is in the conservation of time and energy for more Important things after routine matters are taken care of.' A group of old maid aunts discussed the matter freely, and tho we may say 'What do they know about home management problems,' yet we must grant that they have a perspective on the home that the homemaker within the home sometimes loses. What were the old maid aunts' suggestions? They were centered entirely upon family relationships, and comments upon the division of the household tasks among all members of the family, and frank ' discussion of family income and expenditures. One aunt even went so far as to say that she was tired of hearing the old quotation 'Man's work ends with set of sun but woman's work is never done,' and that If woman's work was never, done It was her own fault, and It was time she was putting some thought into planning and scheduling her work so that it would be done.- All these comments give us some perspective of the prob - lems that confront us lie home management before we set down our home management ideals.

Springfield Mass.. has said, 'The founding, building, and administration of a home is a delicate, complicated and self sacrificing undertaking. It requires thought and resourcefulness in utilizing available knowledge, adapt - ability to people and situations, and keen administrative ability if really desirable standards are to be established and maintained To establish a successful home the home maker must make fine, delicate choices from an extensive environment. These choices must function intensively in family life, until they produce individuals who are v.-orthy members of society. The home maker's sphere of influence is determined by her vision, capacity for creative thinking, and the abil - ity to utilize the knowledges and cultures at her commands.' "Good home management is evaluated in terms or human satis - faction, most important are those contributed by personality train - ing and experience of the individual members. "How can we put our finger upon the elusive thing called man - agement ability that goes to make for the ideal quoted above? That some women have it in abundance and others are entirely lacking is self evident. How can we develop It in the girls growing up today and how may we add to our either meagre or ample store* "Managing seems to be made up of wise choices and so we go back to the securing of information that will help us to make deci - sions wisely whether it be in relation to a children's quarrel or a new vacuum cleaner. Where may information be secured? No need to list numerous agencies giving every conceivable kind of information to the home maker. Where there is a will there is a way. If you need and want information that will assist in wise choices, you can secure that information. "A summary of some of our home management ideals, may be slated as follows: 1. Home management ideals are dependent upon our 'atti - tudes' and 'knowledge.' 2. Home management is made up of wise choices. 3. To achieve our ideals we must add to our knowledge. </seg>
            <seg id="p391">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION 4. The human beings within our homes are the most precious possessions we have. Let us turn our attention towards learning all we can concerning wise human management." County chairmen of extension groups were honored with a recog - nition service conducted by Director W. H. Brokaw who stressed leadership as the most important quality for women to possess in this crucial period of farm life. He urged the women to study cooperative marketing and influence the men in their homes to become acquainted with the workings of the Federal Farm Board. He paid a glowing tribute to the county chairmen in women's project work for their initiative, vision and sympathy, which embody the fundamentals of leadership. Following the recognition, Miss Bess Steele gave an illustrated talk "Pictures to Live. With." She said the purpose of the talk was to help the women study the pictures which were selected on the basis that pictures should mean something to them and should do something for our rooms. Pictures to live with must embody much the same qualifications as the people we choose to live with, sub - stantial, noble, interesting, beautiful in the really worth while things, not surface beauty. A picture is a composition of beautiful lines, darks and lights, colors and an interesting theme. If these are used according to the principles of all fine art a masterpiece is achieved. Henry Turner Bailey said, "Any work of art is great for me that promotes in me the greatest number of ideas which exercise and exalt my spirit." Pictures used for analysis and appreciation were: Madonna of the' Harpies, Andres del Sarto. Young Woman Opening a Casement, Vermeer. Winter Landscape, Gardner Symonds. Harp of the Winds, Homer Martin. St. Genevleve Watching Over Paris, Puvis de Chavannes. Portrait of a Young Man, Raphael. The afternoon program was concluded with a recreation period conducted by Miss Ella Gardner. The last session of the meeting opened on Thursday morning, Mrs. S. P. Davis presiding. Mr. H. E. Bradford sang two solos as the opening number of the program. These were "Love Song" and "Gypsy Trail." Miss Nevada Wheeler accompanied Mr. Bradford. The business meeting followed. Mrs. C. B. Noyes, chairman of the resolutions committee, submitted the following report: "Whereas, as mothers and home makers we are Intensely inter - ested in the home economics department of the College of Agriculture and realize the importance of the training it offers to the young women of the state, and "Whereas, for the exclusive use of this department there has been but one building erected upon the College campus, and </seg>

Dr. Koch said: "There are three great socializing agencies, namely, the home, the church, and the school; but the greatest of these is the home. </seg>
            <seg id="p393">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION There are certain subsidiary agencies such as police departments, for instance, which have traditionally confined their efforts to the appre - hending of criminals after deeds of violence have been done. There - fore, they have not been so constructive in the building of character as have the agencies which attempt to Bet up preventive measures be - fore the act. The legal profession well might assume a more positive share of the burden than it has heretofore. "The task of the home is perhaps relatively no greater or no less than in former days. Whether youth of today is any better or any worse than it has been heretofore can not be established. Therefore ii is fruitless to becloud the issues involved in the rearing of youth with -a discussion of this particular question. "The world which youth will inherit is not the world which youth has made. "Science has made certain contributions to our knowledge of child nature. Because of these contributions the ancient doctrine of - total depravity has been discarded. The modern mode of childhood is expression, not repression. This does not mean, however, that there is not still a definite place for authority In the rearing of children. Scientific facts compel the home,, in whatever task it faces, to approach it down the long road of hard facts. Mere emotionalism does not count. So important is the relation of science to parenthood that adult education has come into the picture in a very positive fashion during these latter days. "Reproduction is but a merely automatic, biological process. Not so, the rearing of the Offspring. Of itself, adulthood constitutes no preparation for parenthood. "Parenthood implies the rearing of a well-rounded properly bal - anced social being, one who can 'see life steadily and see it whole.' "Worthy home membership is broad enough to include health, vocational guidance, the worthy use of leisure time, good citizenship, and ethical character. These represent an undertaking which is com - mon perhaps to all socializing agencies. But the fact that it should be a mutual undertaking Indicates that it must be snared by the home, not merely acquiesced in and delegated to some other agency. For Instance, the public schools have always indicated their willing - ness to get under the task, but they want all the other appropriate agencies to help as well. "Health, vocation, leisure time, citizenship, ethical character, worthy home membership all have spiritual implications. There is a well-established connection between the state of one's health and his outlook on life. Neglect of adenoids, tonsils, and misshapen teeth, in later life will do violence to the child's longing for physical beauty and charm. To have a congenial occupation Is to enjoy a spiritual haven assured by the knowledge that the future is. provided for.

Altho culture first came with leisure time, the present dif - ficulty is that our spiritual resources have not kept pace with the increasing leisure of a mechanized age. "Games, and plays, books and magazines, music and pictures, altho somewhat Victorian in the estimation of superficially-minded people, still render a fundamental spiritual service to the growing child when intelligently provided by his parents. The idea of good citizenship presents a paradox — the- idealism of home, school, and church conflicts with 'acknowledged success' in the world outside. Apparently we forgive a man anything if he makes a million dollars. The ills of American life today demand virile citizenship. This means potent ideals. Ethical character implies religion. The greatest tragedy of all time is that our religion does not grow up with us. Most of us are adult-minded in our businesses or professions and adolescents in religion. . A child of today in Us life tomorrow will not escape crit - ical controversies in things religious. The only safeguard is to let him learn the facts thru fine, progressive religious instruction. "Adults must develop the fine art of imagination — putting them - selves in the child's place, not the child in an adult's place. "Parents must not attempt to solve a trlal-and-error problem by rule-of-thumb methods. The child is a spiritual being — an un - known quantity. He refuses, and has refused, since the race began, to be compressed into a standard pattern. This means that we are dealing with soul stuff. "The rearing of children demands a clear knowledge of the issues involved. The principle of precedence of values applies here. This can be illuminated by the anecdote of the safe-cracker who strapped his son not for stealing the jam, but for the careless way in which he had left his fingerprints over everything. "Success in a social organization is nine-tenths dependent upon the fine art of getting on with one's fellow men. "In our philosophy of life we must not forget that example is greater than precept. The sharp eyes of childhood penetrate pretense." In speaking on the "Ideal Farm Home," Chancellor Burnett said: "In these days of rapid progress, when change is the natural order rather than the exception, the ideal requirements of the farm home may well be given consideration. There are many such homes at the present time as indicated by the 'master farmer' movement and now by the society of 'Master Farm Homemakers Wives.' These are but indications that home making is one of the high lights upon the farm, perhaps outranking all else In enduring values. "With our progress in agriculture by which we have thru in - dustry and good management accumulated our savings In the form of more fertile acres, better homes, power -equipment, both for the home and the .farm operations, it Is natural that we should turn to the </seg>
            <seg id="p397">Nebraska home economics association interests of the wife and children as paramount or at least as of equal importance to that of the production and marketing. "Our larger prosperity has made it possible to build homes on many farms containing all the modern conveniences of the home in town when size of income is considered and where such homes have not yet been built they are in contemplation with the hope of early realizatfon. . "It is a far cry from the sod house of the pioneer to the modern farm home in two generations, indicating the progress we have made even while many farmers feel the economic pressure of the present period. The very prosperity they have experienced is one of the sources of embarrassment since the luxuries of our fathers have be - come necessities to us in this rapidly changing age. Automobiles, power machinery, electricity, plumbing, and sanitary sewage, furnace heat, electric refrigeration, hot and cold water in kitchen and bath room, the telephone, the radio, the daily paper, the movies, jazz, the consolidated rural afrd vocational schools, the agricultural college, the farm bureau, the home demonstration agent, rest camps for farm women, 4-H clubs for boys and girls with trips to the state fair, Chicago, or Washington for the winners; with what amazement would our grand-mothers look upon these changes .perhaps with scant ap - proval, being outside the realm of their experience. Yet all these innovations have come to us with the progress of this generation and we refuse to dispense with any but must learn to use them wisely while we acquire new, innovations when they appeal to us as useful or adding to our enjoyment. "Many things are essential to a successful farm home. Among these are love- of the land as a heritage, a courage which is not de - feated by small difficulties, appreciation of the necessity for coopera - tion in business, faith in the future of our rural civilization, and will - ingness to trust to the rewards of intelligent labor upon the land for the measure of our success. We are all beneficiaries of the heritage of the land, come down to us from our pioneer fathers. Our fertile land, the source of all our wealth, our commodious homes, some of which even now are ancestral, our churches and public schools, the cities and towns which have grown up out of our demand for service upon the land, are the heritage we have received as the accumulated wealth from one or two generations of rural people in this land of opportunity. • ■ ■■ "Let us continue to be rural-minded and' appreciate the oppor - tunity upon the land rather than seek elsewhere for opportunities which He at our very door. To the rural-minded, life in the open country is preferable to life in the city or town.

Too little have we felt the necessity of maintaining a fertile soil upon which our children might live in comfort and enjoy the fruits of their labor. A family which establishes a rural home that is to live on- thru the generations looks upon this .home as the center of its life, Its industry, its rewards and happiness. "From the ancestral home the fledging brood goes out to mea - sure its strength of character and creative genius with the world of affairs, returning at intervals for rest and inspiration and for renew - ing its early memories. The farm home becomes the center of friend - liness for the neighborhood. It is the place where the business of the farm is planned so as to be increasingly successful with the years. It is no mere filling station between the morning lecture circle, after - noon bridge club and the evening show, where one tarries In breath - less haste for a moment between acts, but rather, the place where plans for the business of the farm and the family are made. In these days of serious farm problems it requires all the intelligence and sagacity of the experienced farmer to work out plans for. a successful business enterprise which will maintain the home in relative comfort. "No farm home is ideal without children growing up to take their place in the hearts and lives of the parents and to give stability and purpose of life in the open country. Nor is there a more ideal place in which to bring up a child. Fresh air and sunshine are abundant, dally tasks are natural and compelling. Habits of industry and responsibility develop naturally under such surroundings, so much so that men and women reared in the country are credited with in - itiative and resourcefulness as the result of their training during their habit-forming years. "Schools must be within easy reach. These should be of a size to furnish competition in both classroom and in sports, stimulating the best endeavor of the child. To my mind the rural school with less than two rooms and with fewer than forty or fifty pupils is no longer adequate. I commend the consolidated rural school or the public school organized to provide vocational training as the next step for - ward in rural education. It is not beyond the means of the prosperous farm community. The slowness of its growth is due more to lack of appreciation or to lack of cooperation than to financial limitations. "More and more we demand that our education shall relate itself to achievement so that we may better work out our life problems. The greatest practical' question of every young man or woman Is how to fit himself or herself into the business of life, to become a part of our onward moving civilization and contribute to Its progress. It is true in agriculture but equally true in industry. The educational forces which contribute to the building of successful farm enterprises are among the great conserving forces in the nation. They have pointed the way to profitable types of farming. They have developed our industries and stand today as great contributing forces to our </seg>
            <seg id="p399">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION prosperity. I need not here enlarge upon this aid to rural home building but I have mentioned it because no permanent home can be established except upon a basis of economic independence. "Many of you are asking what place is to be given to rest and recreation, to beauty or architecture, to harmony in furnishings, to labor saving devices, and to beauty of setting in the home building schedule. Home building has become an art which may be applied to town and country alike, with many limitations in the town which do not obtain in the country. The ideal farmstead, with its wind - breaks, its lawns, its far-reaching vistas, its well-placed buildings re - quires more land than can be had in the town, while upon the farm such land is readily available and can be utilized with effectiveness. The University of Nebraska thru its farm building service has con - tributed plans for modern farm buildings, for its water supply, sew - age disposal, and light and power equipment. In the same way it stands ready to assist. still farther in contributing to home planning and to those satisfying features which only women can contribute thru their superior sense of home values. "I do not feel, however, that all of the newfangled ways of life need to be transplanted upon the farm in order to make it an ideal home. Even in the city some strong-minded folk have resisted the sales talk of the agent who would press new wares upon them for monetary reasons and -have thereby escaped the perplexity of spirit which accompanies the desire to be ultra-modern. "Let us consider further what appliances are ' within the reach of 1 every progressive farm home. The automobile Is a necessity. By its use the farm family has its daily range of activity multiplied from 20 to 100 times over pre-automobile times. In my childhood days the farmer's activities were normally confined to the farm or to his nearest market town. A trip to town five miles away by team and \yagon required an entire half day where now it requires but thirty minutes for the round trip if the roads are good. I recall an occasion when I spent four hours on horesback making an emergency trip from the farm to a town four miles away and .returning. In those clays the county seat town, if fifteen miles away, was visited twice a year, once to pay taxes and once to attend the county fair. Now mother and the children see the picture shows, attend church or the lecture programs, or do their social stunts at such distances as a part of their day's work. Likewise the telephone and the radio have come to be a necessity. Thru the radio comes the daily market quotations, the weather forecasts, the daily chats of Mrs. True Homemaker, and the all-important agricultural college lectures. You hear the current events from the national capital at Washington. Even the voice of the President of the United States reaches out on important occasions to every farm and hamlet in the nation, equipped with radio service. The great operas and concerts available via radio are cultural in - fluences in our lives, and God forgive the travesty, from this same </seg>
            <seg id="p400">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE source come jazz and advertising without limit, but not without our power to choose. "With all these changes has come greater opportunity to build purposeful homes upon the farms with more need for information and more necessity to choose the best which is available. Such a home must work out a program of life which will be interesting and worth while, one which gives contentment and satisfaction to Its members and which promotes a larger community welfare. More and more is our welfare bound up with that of the whole community — we can not prosper unless the community prospers. We can not build ideal homes except as conditions are made favorable for sim - ilar homes nearby where congenial friends add to the joys of life. "There is great opportunity on the land for Ideal living; once the economic problems are solved thru good management and family co - operation. The 'Master Farm Home Makers' have pointed the way by setting up standards and giving emphasis to the more important quali - fications of such a home. Every farm wife and mother has aspira - tions to live in such a home and to bequeath It to her children. It should be a shelter for the family, affording- creature comforts, con - tentment, and physical well being. In its large sense it should be a spiritual blending of the ideals of husband, wife and children in a common purpose. Cooperation in the Interest of the family welfare should be Its highest joy — beauty of plan and harmony of arrange - ment will not be absent. Cultural influences will be there. Rest - fulness and refreshment will ever be present, but the dominant note of such a home will be purposeful and effective living directed by a will of the master homemaker whose experience and courage gives effectiveness to her labors." The first master' farm homemaker presentation in Nebraska was held In connection with the meetings of Organized Agriculture on January 9, 1930. Miss Mary-Ellen Brown, state home demonstration leader, told of the responsibility of homemaking and how it came about that Nebraska had Master Farm Homemakers. She introduced Chancellor Burnett of the University who spoke In part as follows: "We should endeavor to cultivate in the state an ambition, an aspiration for our citizens to be the first In the land In Intelligence, first in the land In their effort to build a great commonwealth, first in the land in their effort to establish and develop spiritual values. Eut I ought above all to say that no university, no organization can be greater or can be very different from the group that It represents and the ideals of the university will be built very largely upon the ideals of the people who come to It, who represent you In the Uni - versity. The students in the University are a cross section of the people of the state, of the homes from which they come and they will be as good, we certainly hope they will be as good; as the average of the state. We hope they will be as Intelligent as the average of the state. We hope that with such a selected group of people coming </seg>
            <seg id="p401">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION from the homes of the state that we will be able to contribute some - thing which will increase their desire to be good citizens which will increase their efficiency in the assumption of their life's work because of the education which they receive and we hope above all things as they go out from this University they may ampliate the spirit of service which helps to build a nation." Dean \V. W. Burr of the Agricultural College said there is noth - ing that will raise a nation or a state above the level of its homes and its mothers and he congratulated the women who were to be honored not only for their achievements but for their part in de - veloping the great commonwealth of Nebraska. The training and maintaining of the morale probably falls more heavily upon the women than' the men but Dean Burr said he had enough faith in the men of America and in the men of Nebraska that they will find some solution for their problems. The desirability for greater facilities for the young women who came to the College had been uppermost in the minds of the author - ities and the future looked very bright. Dean Burr said. The College of Agriculture is more deeply interested in the training of the young women who are going out to be the mothers .of the next generation than it is interested in the men to go out and make more money. Dean Burr assured the audience of the hearty cooperation of the Agricultural College in the Master Farm Homemaker movement. Miss Fedde, chairman of the Home Economics Department, ex - pressed her pleasure of being present at such a meeting and con - gratulated the five Master Farm Homemakers. She told of a re - action she had received when the first master farmers had been rec - ognized. She wondered why the same thing could not be done for the homemakers as was done for the farmers. Some said it just could not be done. But some people got to thinking about it and out of that thinking grew something which is to be materialized at this meeting. Miss Fedde thought the standard of the work sheet was so fine, that she is going to use it in her department in connec - tion with the college work. The freshman girls are going to use this work and score sheet in their class work to help them clarify their thinking of the purpose of homemaklng. Mrs. Weaver, wife of the Governor of Nebraska, was present at the meeting and she responded briefly as follows: "I bring greetings and congratulations to these women and I feel honored that I have been invited to be with them. I feel that I have the background of a farm woman as I was born and raised on a farm. But it is a great pleasure to bring greetings on this day. I regret that Mr. Weaver could not be here. He is out in the state but I am sure he would have felt it an honor to have been here with these master farm homemakers today." Miss Bess Rowe of the Farmer's Wife told of the beginning of the Master Farm Homemaker movement and how wide spread it is </seg>
            <seg id="p402">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE now over the United States. The plan followed In selecting the honieniakers was explained. She said one of the nice things about the whole recognition is that most of the women do not know until they get the work sheet and the letter from the Farmer's Wife that they have been nominated. She said it is a recognition on the part of the community and the life the homemaker has lived and the serv - ice she has given. Miss Rowe further stated that the Agricultural College and the Farmer's Wife do not say that these particular home - makers were the best but that they do say that here was' a group of farm women typical of high standards in Nebraska and other states. They are Nebraska's representatives in the nation wide cor - poration of homemakers. She explained that the Master Farm Home - makers were not chosen because of wealth or education as some homemakers past 70 years have been honored and other are women who stopped school when they were 9 years old. But these women have been reading and growing until they have become educated. These Master Farm Homemakers live on farms varying from the 12 - acre truck farm in Kentucky to the 14,000 to 16,000 acre ranch on the plains of Texas. Most of the Master Farm Homemakers have children in the family altho . there has been two or three women honored who have not had children. The largest family, which con - sisted of 14 children, was in Vermont. Several unmarried women have been honored but these women have brought up a family of children so they have carried the responsibilities of a normal home, Miss Rowe stated. When Miss Rowe presented the Master Farm Homemaker pins to the women she explained what it signified and following this each woman responded briefly. Mrs. Neighbors one of the Master Farm Homemakers was unable to be presente on account of Illness in the family. Following is Mrs. Wickersham's response: "I want to first thank Miss Rowe for this wonderful movement that she has put across in this nation. It seems to me that it is just wonderful and this pin is something that I shall always cherish. And I shall try so hard to be worthy of the confidence and the faith that my friends and neighbors and the Farmer's Wife paper has placed in me. Words can not tell what this all means to me." Mrs. Fi tcher spoke as follows: "I want to tell you how very happy I am to be here. It came to me as a very unexpected pleasure and I was astonished that I had won the degree Master Farm Homemaker. Our speaker has told us that we should have a hobby and should ride that hobby. My hobby is flowers. We have flowers all over the place and have it so ar - ranged that we have flowers all summer thru. We will be glad to have any of you come to see our flowers. I want to thank all those who have made this movement possible. They can not realize what </seg>
            <seg id="p403">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION this means to all of us. And then I have a little surprise for you. This day falls on my birthday." Mrs. Peterson: "This is one of the proudest moments of my life when my neigh - bors and friends have considered it worth while to have honored and called me Master Farm Horaemaker, I think I was born to live on a farm but I lived in the city of New York in a tenement house when a girl. You know the advantages of agriculture there. When it was possible my mother took me and my sister into the park but the policeman was always near to watch us for I wanted always to pick the flowers and bring them home. But Ma would tell me it I did that she would never bring me again. I lived there for 9 y.ears when I came to Nebraska to the town of Utica. We lived with a dear old lady who had the most wonderful flowers and I filled all the tin cans I could find with soil and dug weeds and planted them, not knowing the difference. I tied colored scraps of goods on the weeds. That was my first flower garden. Now I have flowers to my heart's con - tent and I am perfectly happy for I think every home should have flowers for our highest aim should be to make the world better, for if we give the best to the world the best of the world will come back to us. I am so happy for I have lived and worked with those who love me whose hearts are kind and true and for the good that I can do." Mrs. Davis: "I do not see how I can adequately thank the Farmer's Wife and especially Miss Rowe for this recognition which I have received. I do not believe that I can adequately thank the friends in my own county, and especially one friend. But I want you all to know that 1 appreciate it and it has been doubly nice for I know you have meant it. I want to tell you about this one friend. When I told her I could not fill out the work sheet, she told me that she would come over and write down everything which I would tell her, so she came over and I talked while I worked and in that way the work sheet was made out. The Master Farm Homemaker movement is a wonderful piece of work as it is the recognition of the ideals that we all hope to reach, that we always have desired to have." Mr. W. H. Brokaw, Director of the Extension Service, expressed appreciation of the work which these women have done in their com - munities and stated that the interest of the entire college and the entire Institution was for such things as they had worked out. On Thursday afternoon the program consisted of a conducted tour thru Morrill Hall and a tea served by the Ceres Club. The tour began in the lower corridors of Morrill Hall under the guidance of Professor E. H. Barbour. At 3:00 P. M. Professor P. H. Orummann spoke to the group who had assembled on "Modern Artists and Their Work." Professor Grummann said: </seg>
            <seg id="p404">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE "The Fine Arts Department of the University of Nebraska 1b fortunate in owning some splendid collections. The Hall collection is one of the most important gifts given to art in this region for some time. The Beckwith collection of hand copies of masterpieces is one of the most valuable collections of that kind in the world. The treasures of the Fine Arts Department includes paintings, etchings, and casts. "At the beginning of the 19 th century the artists left their studios, took their palates and went out into the open to paint what they saw. They said, we have drawn on our Imagination long enough. The world is full of beautiful things. Let's paint them. The first man who did this was thought to be insane, but that insanity was of r. good type. Soon all the painters were doing it. "They confronted a new lot of problems. They found they had not been painting nature. Things were far brighter outdoors than things indoors. They found It difficult to paint bright things In the sunshine. "Our tastes are changing. We have been accustomed to the bright pictures, now. However, people resent change. But we are now accustomed to the bright picture and do not care for the subdued, dull pictures. - "As artists began to study snow, they found It was not white, but that it had a lot of color in it. Redfield made fine paintings of snow. He painted outdoors, and found it an extremely difficult thing to do. "At the beginning of the 19th century painters went outdoors and studied out door life. This is called the realistic school. A new trend arose. Painters found that it does not pay to be to realistic In painting. They began to paint the impressions one gets, rather than what is actually there. This is the impressionistic school — not to paint in the entirety, but to give us an impression. This school conveys the general impression to us. This is employed very skill - fully in painting sunlight. Instead of mixing the colors on the palate, they would oppose one to the other. They would give us a strong effect on the eye. They make the observer work harder. Juxtaposition of relative colors. They painted sunlight most effectively. Makes canvas luminous. "So we progressed from realistic to impressionistic. But things are constantly changing. The impressionistic school was followed by the expressionistic school. This modern art! What is it all about? We see it in the magazines. What does it mean? It is what the artist feels inside. The interesting thing is the artist's mind. They seem to paint crazy ideas without the slighest meaning. The futur - istic painter is trying to tell you what, is in his mind. Not what he sees. I think a lot of this modern art- is merely JUNK. In every art movement there are always a lot ' of people who have not had. </seg>
            <seg id="p405">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION any training. The vast majority of the. modernistic painters are those who could not paint in the old school. We must be extremely careful In accepting much of the modernistic painting. There is very much in modern art that is going to last after 9/10 is thrown away. That proportion is very good. "I have seen some modernistic painting that is wonderful. 'Spirit of the Great City' hangs in New York City. It is a set of straight lines, planes with certain colors, lights and below is the title. Not a suggestion of a house, not a suggestion of a chimney or a railroad. But when I looked at that painting, I felt like I do when I ride in the subway. 'This Awful City.' The artist had put that feeling In that picture. "Absolutely all art is here to create certain feelings that are not here. The artist today is saying, 'In the last generation the people have been copying too much. Why not do something original,' and there Is a certain justification to that. Good reason why that has happened. When art first developed, the only way to get a picture was from an artist painter. About 75 years ago, began photography. Began to reproduce accurately, and the artist said, 'Where do I come in?' The modern artist says, 'We are creating something out of our minds.' Then he described the machine advent, with the consequent loss of craftsmanship. We are going back to school. Getting some training. Increase In school attendance and getting training for life. Described the old fashioned parlor. What has that to do with modern art? Pictures painted 75 years ago had everything stuck in them, too much gingerbread. Art means simplicity. The Japanese have the secret — a single vase and a single rose. Modern art is working in the direction of simplicity. Going to make impossible the overloaded canvases. Teach us to carry that principle .of simplicity, right straight into our lives." Following this talk the group went to Ellen Smith Hall where tea was served by the Ceres Club.

The same general plan was followed which' was used other years, that is, the time was divided between resting, recreation and inspirational talks or discussions. The women, enjoyed not knowing what was to be served at a meal until they came to the table. Each woman washed her own dishes but it did not seem like work for a game was made out of it. During the summer of 1929 five district camps were held as follows: Lexington, June 18-21, at Presbyterian Conference Grounds. Sidney, June 25-28, at Kreugers Lake, 6 miles east of Sidney. Deweese, July 30- August 2, at Hastings Klwanis Park. Curtis, August 6-9, at School of Agriculture. Camp Brewster, August 13-16, at Y. W. C. A. camp, 1 mile south of Omaha. Each camp had its own enrollment blank which was similar to the following: MOTHERS VACATION CAMP ENKOIiUVIKNT BLANK HASTINGS KIWANIS CAMP AT DEWEESE Vacation Camp Circular 2 — 1929 .

The programs at the various camps were somewhat similar, altho in some Instances there were different speakers. The round table discussion statements used were the same altho different Y. W. C. A. workers had charge of the period. A copy of these statements will be .found in the report on Western Nebraska Organized Agriculture so they are not repeated here. A copy of the program used at Kreugers Lake is to be found on the following page. It is typical of the others. All of the camps were held in buildings. The camp sites were selected in February and March and were located in different parts of the state so that more women might attend. The cots and the cooking equipment are furnished by the Extension Service. A boy takes them in a truck. . He stays at the camp and assists by bring - ing in the water, disposes of the garbage and goes after supplies. Miss Marjorie Anderson of York planned the meals and did the purchasing of supplies. Mrs. K. E. Gleason of York was the cook. Mrs. Jennie Klimm of Plattsmouth, Nebraska, wrote an article about the Mothers Vacation Camp at Brewster, in which she said: "During this last summer the members of our club held their annual vacation and outing at Camp Brewster. The entertainment at this outing consisted of swimming, music, games, and round table discussions, which were very interesting and gave those present a very wide area from which to choose. There were 92 of us in camp, which was the greatest number so far enrolled to take in all of these splendid and very interesting features. Thirty-one of those enrolled were from Cass county. There were eleven counties represented at this outing, which included the following counties: Cass county . Douglas county Richardson county Otoe county Thuraton county Lancaster county Sarpy county Dakota county Washington county Burt county Adams county Those who helped make this outing a success were: Miss Adrla Titterington, Chicago, Illinois, Rural District Y.

Miss Clara U re water is the Director of Camp B re water and we all appreciated very much her hospitality extended to us during our stay at this camp. Miss Ruth Enslow was our leader for all of our hiking trips thru the three hundred acres of picturesque' woodland and Bird Reserve of the Brewster Hills.' This was a most wonderful and beautiful trip for those who had the pleasure of taking this trip during the Mothers Vacation. On the very top 01° one of- the highest hills is a natural basin, and here someone who had a love for the birds have erected a bird bath stand, which made this a very beautiful spot away up in the hills. Thru the picturesque woodland, along the west side of the Missouri River we wandered back to our camp after a most pleasing afternoon stroll, all set for a hearty dinner at camp. The meals served at this camp were wonderful and very appetizing. Last, but not least, is Billie, the lady who looks after every - thing around Camp Brewster. She is always cheerful and ever ready to help all who need her assistance. Everything was most pleasant, and everyone was most wonderful to us during our stay at this camp. The weather was cool, but pleasant. At night we all sat around the fireplace while the Camp - fire girls danced for us, and other, amusements took place. There were 75 camp fire girls with us at this camp which also helped to make our stay. there, a most pleasant one. The swimming beach was another great attraction at this camp and altho the weather was quite cool, many took advantage of the opportunity to go In for a swim, which was thoroly enjoyed by all. On Wednesday night each county delegation made up a song about their particular county. Prizes were awarded in this contest, and we are pleased to know that Cass county received one of the prizes. ' Round table discussions were the feature of our Thursday and Friday afternoon entertainment, and the following questions were discussed. These questions were very interesting and also very help - ful to us: (The round table discussion statements on Family Relationships, How do You Look at Life? Economic and Citizenship Problems, and Citizenship and Legislation were given in this article but are omitted here.) Thursday night was stunt night at the camp, and this was a "Big Night" during our stay there. Groups from the different cabins were put together for the many stunts exhibited that night. These were all very entertaining. . . At our Friday afternoon program we were entertained by Mr. H. Howard Biggar, of the Stockman's Journal, who read poems on every day life.

PART HI 4-H CLUB WORK In order to stimulate more interest in 4-H home economics judging contests the Home Economics Section this year again gave one hundred dollars to apply toward expenses for trips to the Na - tional Club Congress held in Chicago each year. These trips are awarded to winners of the judging contests held at the Nebraska State Fair. The winners enter the national judging contests held in Chicago. The Home Economics Section believes these judging con - tests to be a phase of 4-H club work which helps girls to establish and recognize standards, to weigh values and to develop judgment. The names of the winners of these trips are printed below with letters expressing the appreciation of the girls and stories of their trips which help one to realize the meaning and value of such experiences to a 4-H club girl.

After we were assigned our rooms, we registered and received our identi - fication badges. After lunch we went for a bus ride around the city. We saw all the main points of interest in Chicago, besides becoming acquainted with some of the fifteen hundred boys and girls who attended the Congress. Sunday evening we went to the Methodist Temple, where a special sermon was given for us. Monday morning we went out to the International Livestock show where the contests were held. Most of the club folks were busy judging or demonstrating all morning. . Sears, Roebuck and Company served lunch, and the rest of the afternoon was spent at the live stock show. Monday evening we were entertained by Mr. Thomas Wilson, with dinner and a program. Tuesday was the busiest day we had. We ate breakfast at Ar - mour's and were taken for a trip thru the plant. This was very in-. teresting, since Armour's is one of the largest packing plants in America. For lunch the girls went to the Chicago Mail Order Com - pany and were shown thru the business house. In the afternoon we went out to the Field Museum. Here everyone looked at the things tie wished. We went back to the hotel about 5:30, and dressed for dinner. That evening we went to the 4-H Club banquet at the Sher - man Hotel, where we were royally entertained. Wednesday was division day.

I think, without doubt, that this week was the most enjoyable I have ever spent, and I value most highly the friends that I made on this trip. I think every person that attended this Congress will agree with me. I think the most valuable things that Nebraska boys and girls received from this Congress were the interest, enthusiasm, and new ideas that were obtained from meeting, and coming to know the club folks from the entire United States. I certainly enjoyed my trip, and I urge every person who has the chance to attend this Congress to take advantage of it without hesitation. IONE GIBBS. Lincoln, Nebr., Dec. 9. 1929. .Miss Helen Rocke, Agricultural College, Lincoln, Nebr. Dear Miss Rocke: I wish to express my sincere thanks to the State Home Economics Association for their kindness in paying me $25.00 on my trip to Chicago. I appreciate it very much. I am very glad that thru them I was privileged to attend the Eighth National 4-H Club Congress. My only regret is that I did not bring back better honors to my state. Sincerely yours, NORMA PETERSON. From November 30th to December 6th I had the privilege of at - tending .the Eighth National 4-H Club Congress held In Chicago. In these few days I saw more and learned more than I probably could have in- twice that time ordinarily. We were continually busy and being entertained by the many friends of the 4-H Club work. Our headquarters were at the Hotel LaSalle. The Nebraska delegation of about 50, arrived on Sunday morning. At this time all groups registered. In the afternoon we went on a tour thru Chicago. Even tho this tour lasted several hours, we did not see nearly all of Chicago. This gave me an idea how large this city really is. Sun - day evening we went to the First Methodist Episcopal Church in the Chicago Temple, the church that is situated in the midst of the Chi - cago business district. </seg>
            <seg id="p418">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE On Monday from. 10 A. M. until 3 P. M., I was one of the group judging baked goods. At 4:00 in the afternoon all the club members were entertained by Wilson and Company. They had a continuous program for us from 4:30 until 8:30 in their own auditorium. This was one of the most appreciated programs of the week. Thomas E. Wilson gave a dinner to all delegates and leaders. Tuesday morning we were guests of Armour and Company for breakfast. After the program we were taken thru this huge plant. After seeing it, one can readily believe that it is one of the largest packing plants. The girls were guests of the Chicago Mail Order Company for luncheon. We made a short tour thru this building, the home of "Style Queen" fashions. After the program given by this company we went to the famous Field Museum. In the short time we had we could hardly see the many wonderful things in this building. How - ever, I managed to at least find the mammoth whale. One ' could easily spend weeks in this museum and not see everything. That evening, Tuesday, we had' a banquet in the Grand Ballroom of the Sherman Hotel. This program was broadcast by station WLS. Among the many other features was the parade "Boys and Girls 4-H Clubs' each separate letter made of ice and illuminated in various colors. This banquet was one of the "high spots." All of the girls were guests of Montgomery Ward and Company on Wednesday. After breakfast we were taken thru this large plant. One of the interesting things was that in order to go from one part to another, we went thru a tunnel under the street. From Montgomery Ward we went to the Model Farm at Mundelein, 111., as guests of the Public Service Company of Northern Illinois. On this farm all work, in all buildings, is done either by gas or electricity. It really is a "model farm." In the afternoon we attended the horse show as guests of the International Livestock Exposition. Here we certainly had a chance to see many beautiful horses. That evening we attended 'the 4-H club party at the Hotel LaSalle. Thursday morning we went thru the Harvester plant. This was, to say the least, an interesting and educational trip. We went thru the smelter and tractor factory. This alone, not to mention binders, mowers, and all the rest, was a town in itself. For luncheon we were still guests of the International Harvester Company. Thursday afternoon the girls, under leaders, were allowed to go shopping or ' wherever they chose. On Thursday evening the . final banquet was given at Palmer House at which time we were guests of the railroads. We were royally entertained at this banquet as we had been at all the others, </seg>
            <seg id="p419">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION At 11 that evening we left for home. We came to Lincoln at 3:30 P. M. on Friday. I am very glad that I could go to this Club Congress.

Miss Rebekah Gibbons of the University of Nebraska will discuss "Food Pads and False Advertising," and Chancellor Burnett of the University will deliver an address which should be of interest to every citizen of the state. FRIDAY FORENOON, DECEMBER 13 Congregational Church 9:30 Music — Business Meeting. What's New in Nutrition — Miss Rebekah Gibbons, Agricultural College, Lincoln. Miss Gibbons is head of the foods division of the home economics department at the college. Family Relationships and How to Look at Life — Round table discussion led by Mrs. Henry Bruss, Chappell. Constructive Discipline — Miss Ruth Staples. What Shall We Take Home from this Meeting? Everyone should join in this discussion. It is probably the best one of your entire group of meetings. Mrs. Henry Bruss, the vice-president, opened the meeting because Mrs. Royal was unable to be present. Miss Dorothy Jones gave a piano solo. This was followed by greetings from the vice-president. Mrs. Gilbert Weir of Denver spoke on the topic "Good Pictures Improve the Home." She said' her favorite definition for art was that it was the way of conducting the affairs of life in the best way. She quoted the following from Otto Kohn: "Art belongs to the people. I include the well to do, the distinguished, the successful, the learned, as well as the butcher, the baker and the candle stick maker. Life is not complete which does not include a responsiveness to the call of beauty and art, which does not know the thrill that comes with these things. To be complete, to fulfill life's purpose it must foster taste for art and seek to minister to that subtle, indefinable thing which we call soul. The lives of the vast majority of people are cast upon a background of sameness and monotony. The world's work must be done, all the more reason for cultivating the pastures where beauty and inspiration may be gathered by all. We all — rich and poor — need to give our souls an airing once in a while. We need to exercise the muscles of our inner selves, we must have an outlet for </seg>
            <seg id="p422">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE our Inner emotions. Some of the unrest of the day, some of the seeking after the sensations, arise from the lack of opportunity to g-lve expression to our inner selves. Much can be done by art to give satisfaction to these natural impulses. Art is true democracy, know - ing nothing of cast, class or rank. It may bestow its choicest gifts on utter poverty. It may deny them entirely to great wealth." Art is associated with the period in which it developed. It re - flects the art of the times, so having a historical background is val - uable in appreciating pictures. Some of the world's greatest artists have been born and raised in the humblest homes. Murillo, the Spanish painter, was a humble person who had contacts with poor people. Caruso sang on the streets of his home town of Naples. Shakespeare the strolling player, had parents who were farmers. Robert Burns was a "poet peasant born — who more of fame's immortal dower onto his country brings than all her kings." Mrs. Weir said a home must be more than a house for there must be a homelike spirit in It. Good pictures add much to the home spirit. A degrading picture should never be found in a home. Each picture (should be selected with care. It should function because it has a cultural and educational value. It opens up a train of thought and stimulates thinking as it serves in beautifying the home. Pictures should not portray pain, nor fear but they should uplift. We should be independent in selecting our pictures, never buy pictures just be - cause your neighbor had it. If you enjoy a picture have it, but do not have a masterpiece unless it appeals to you. Some of the pictures with which we are familiar are like old friends. It is always well to study the life of the artist when study - ing a picture for then we can better understand what he was trying to tell in his picture. Among the old masters we will find Raphael's Sistlne Madonna. In this picture we see an unusual face. Leonardo da Vinci's Last Supper is another of the wonderful pictures. In it we see anxiety in most of the faces, while there' is an expression of guilt on the face of Judas. Mrs. Weir then told interesting things about pictures which she felt all should be familiar. Among those described were the Im - maculate Conception, Mona Lisa, Feast of Belshazzar, the Ascension, Christ and Nicodemus, the Woman Enthroned, the Angelus, The Gleaners, Man with a Hoe, .Dance of the Nymphs, Oxen Ploughing, Oxen Drinking, Horse Fair, Stag at Bay, West Wind, Coast of Maine, Song of the Lark, Grand Canyon of Arizona, Mount of the Holy Cross, Blue Boy, Pinkie, Age of Innocence, Baby Stuart, Smiling Cavalier, George Washington, Martha Washington, Whistler's Mother, Alexander Hamilton, Frieze of the Prophets, Quest of the Holy Grail, King Lear, Christmas Bells and others. As Mrs. Weir spoke of the different pictures she told something about the artist. In closing she urged all to see the Library of Con - gress and Nebraska's own distinguished capital. </seg>
            <seg id="p423">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION Mrs. Viola B. Shepherd was unable to be present so Mrs. Weir's talk was followed by a 4-H club team demonstration given by Dor - othy Dodd and Bertha Baker of Mitchell on Refinlshlng Old Furniture. These 4-H club girls had been members of a Girl's Room Club. In their demonstration they showed how to remove the old finish with steel wool, sandpaper, a steel scraper and soap and water. They then told about drying the piece of furniture thoroly after which paint, enamel, duco or other finishes may be added. They discussed the care of brushes and gave a brief talk on a study of woods. They demonstrated how to remove spots and how to keep fur - niture looking its best. In closing they gave a discussion on colors for the various rooms and suggested that each room should have a personality. Mrs. D. E. O'Connor of Deuell county gave a talk on "Literature for Children." Her talk was an instructive one on good books for children. THURSDAY FORENOON Mrs. Henry Bruss, Presiding After Mrs. Bruss had opened the meeting, Mrs. Nellie Wilson, the clly librarian for Scottsbluff, gave a talk on "Magazine for the Whole Family." She said: "We are surely justified In stating that this Is a magazine age. More than ever before the reading public Is a periodical reading public. The number of magazines published is increasing in spite of the large number which every year cease publication. The interest in the subject matter of periodicals also seems to be shifting. The literary magazine Is still widely read, but the growing Interest in social affairs, in biography and in what people are doing is unques - tionably Increasing. Even the Interest in the worse types of fiction and the petty and sordid details of the "personal sketches" which infest many popular periodicals is often only a perverted desire for wider knowledge of what men are doing. "The periodical, no less than the formal book, is the molder of opinion, and quite as logical as books, for information along all lines. If the best periodicals the public can be induced to read are provided there is no need of regret on any one's part. It is the quality of the matter read which counts, not the form in which it is presented, and is often the only thing many will read. "If selected intelligently these meet the demand for "something new" quite as well as new books do, at a much less cost. But no general standards or prepared lists of periodical titles can take the place of an intelligent study of local needs by the purchaser. There </seg>
            <seg id="p424">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE are. nevertheless, a few general tests which can be applied to almost any periodical. The smaller the subscription list, the more rigidly the selection must be made. 1st It should be a magazine that will be read, as the purchase of an unused magazine is a blunder. 2nd It should include material of the highest quality. 3rd It should definitely meet some intellectural, social or in - dustrial need which involves study of the tastes and needs of the readers in the family. There is a special magazine for almost any profession or kind of business, so when we try to select magazines for all the family, or in which the average American family would be interested, we must decide of whom the average family is composed. Your family, my family, or the family across the way. "Let us say the father, in the family Is the manager or the em - ployer in a small business, or a farmer, or lawyer, or doctor. The mother is a church member, belongs to a parent-teacher association, is a member of the woman's club, belongs to a couple of social clubs. There is a son who has reached the dignity of 15 years, then two or more children of both sexes In the grades, I think this is an aver - age American family. "Now the father, if he is progressive, both as to his own business, and to all things pertaining to civic betterment, will want the best magazine on general business, or the best one published especially, for his own particular business or profession, and one on general information on all current subjects, for the former, I would suggest. If a doctor, his own medical journal. If a lawyer, a magazine pertain - ing to the law business, if a farmer, a good farm journal. The Nebraska Fanner, Lincoln, weekly, $I.OO One of the oldest of agricultural journals, a weekly, that reg - ularly includes news notes, market reports, articles on sheep, hogs, and poultry, hints on crop and cultivation, household hints, and other special departments. For all general business. Nation's Business, Washington, D. C, $3.OO Of interest to the banker, chain store manager, radio merchant, business of the government, Chambers of Commerce, in fact every line of business. For the latter, of general information on all cur - rent subjects. ' i . Time, Chicago, weekly, $5.00 It is a condensed weekly digest, covering a wide field, its ar - rangement and concise articles make It of great value to the busy man or woman who desires to be well informed at the least expen - diture of time. </seg>
            <seg id="p425">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION Literary Digest, New York, weekly, $4.00 One of the most popular of the current events magazines, by selecting excerpts from foreign and American periodicals, an effort is made to present all sides of a question, whether religious, social, political, or cultural. All members of the family, from the eight yea* old boy or girl, to grandfather will look forward to its weekly ap - pearance. Good Housekeeping, New York, monthly, $3.00 The mother or the housewife, whose tasks have become increas - ingly complex will find in this magazine an efficient tool. Treats all phases of housekeeping with special departments for cookery, house - hold engineering, building, needlework, entertainments and fashions, with much emphasis on personal hygiene and the care of children. It is not, however, exclusively for the housewife. In each issue there are short stories, a serial or two, and a number of special articles by good contributors, Ladies Home Journal, Philadelphia, monthly, 91.00 The usefulness and popularity of this magazine can best be judged by its circulation of two million. A typical woman's magazine with various departments, including fashions, needlework, housekeeping, as well as serials and short stories. It is also the official organ of the American Home Economics Association. Better Homes and Gardens, Des Moincs, Iowa, monthly, 60c It seems to me in- this age of the day where every home has a little plot of ground in front or behind the ' house to beautify for cither a garden of vegetables or flowers or both, that a garden maga - zine is one of the most helpful of periodicals. The Better Homes and Gardens is a very inexpensive publication beautifully illustrated, with splendid articles on home building, vegetable and flower gardens, which appeal to the person of cultural taste, with a moderate Income all presented in a most attractive way. Popular Science Monthly, New York, monthly, $S.5O For the boys of the family, especially of a mechanical turn of mind, this magazine is good, also Popular Mechanics, Chicago, {2.50. They are both Just what their names imply, a profusely illustrated popular, magazine of mechanics and inventions. The man or boy who enjoys working with his hands will here find material to his liking. The numerous short articles ■ cover among other things automobiles, ships, radio, health and hygiene. St. Nicholas, New York, *4.OO This is another staunch old favorite which is still as popular as ever for girls and boys from ten to fifteen. They will especially enjoy </seg>
            <seg id="p426">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE the inspirational stories, feature articles, review of current events, radio section, and other articles of timely interest. I think that our bound copies of St. Nicholas, circulate more often than any book of the same type. Boy's Life, New York, monthly, $8.00 The official organ of the Boy Scouts. Short stories and serials dealing with outdoor life and adventure or with other phases of boy life. Occasional poetry and general articles of informational type and special departments. For the younger members of the family. Child Life, Chicago, monthly, $3.OO Primarily for children of twelve years or younger. Short stories, easy poetry, and brief plays for children. It has several special de - partments of out door sports for young children, plays and pageants. It is increasing in popularity In all libraries and schools. Junior Home, Chicago, monthly, $2.50 For' children from five years on, pictures and sprightly decora - tions done partly in color. Puzzle' page, out door sports, also at least one good article for parents. Then of general interest to the family are the following two magazines. American, New York, monthly, $2S.5O One of the most widely circulated general magazines specializing in success stories, usually of self made men and women of a wide range of activity and achievement. Also articles on home life, general articles, an occasional poem and fiction of unimpeachable respect - ability of tone. Widely read by youth and adults of both sexes. Hygeia, Chicago, monthly, $3.OO A magazine devoted to personal and public health, published by the American Medical Association. Articles for parents, teachers and others interested in the prevention and cure of disease. Scientifically accurate articles written in popular style and well illustrated. A guide to intelligent self help to restoring and retaining health, but avoids any advice on self treatment for conditions in which expert advice is desirable. The best' of its kind for popular use. It is not assumed of course, that the family would subscribe for all these periodicals, but the compilation was made with the idea in mind that any one or more of the magazines would be enjoyed and needed in such a family. ' Mrs. Dorothy Lannlng gave a piano solo. Mr. Harry Gould took the place of Director Brokaw who was unable to attend the organized agriculture meetings. . Mr. Gould talked on the topic, "Leadership and What It Means." </seg>
            <seg id="p427">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION Mr. Gould complimented the Nebraska women on what they had been able to do on leadership. They have shown the men of Ne - braska what leadership really means. The question of leadership is uppermost In the minds of agricultural people. All agree that there is something the matter with agriculture for there are many farm problems and all kinds of remedies have been suggested. The out - standing problem is lack of leadership. Where does leadership start? In the local community. Leadership does not develop over night. Lindbergh may seem to be an exception but he had been preparing and preparing to be able to accomplish what he did. Leadership starts in the local community. Fortunate Indeed is the local com - munity which has efficient, unselfish leadership, especially If the com - munity recognize it and give it their assistance. During the past few years, leadership in agriculture is lagging behind. The agri - cultural leaders have gone Into other industries and they have be - come leaders there. Agriculture is to have an opportunity for develop - ing leadership thru the Farm Board. That board has a real task before it. It is a credit to Nebraska that three of the board have been drawn from Nebraska. Alexander Legge's old home was in north - east Nebraska. He is a man of a high type of leadership. He has a real desire to render service for he is a rich man who left a better paying job to take up this work. He is a man who after he lost his wife and child built an orphanage and furnishes money to run it. Ex-governor McKelvle is another Nebraska man, also, Mr. Christensen who came from near Minden. He was a tall Norwegian boy who took a course in Agriculture, then went abroad and studied marketing. Nebraska can be proud of these three men. - What qualities must one possess to become a leader? One needs to have an inspiration and- to have. a vision so that he or she can see some service that needs to be done. What is life? Is It just to gain thrills? Its real purpose is to render service, to render some worth while help to home, community, county, state and nation. First, is vision. There is something worth while to which we will dedicate our lives. Second, is to have confidence in one's self. Those who say "I can't" will not be the highest type of leaders. A leader must have confidence in his own ability for every one has some ability and can render secvice. Third, is to have initiative. This quality Is lacking In some peo - ple but a leader needs to have ability to plan and think things thru. Fourth, Is Intellectual training. This quality may be secured If one has the determination. Fifth, is unselfishness. A few leaders are selfish and work for personal gain but it does not help them get far for it has its effect upon others. </seg>
            <seg id="p428">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Sixth, is the influence of the home life. The influence of the . early home life lasts all thru life. Among the rewards for leadership will be found the satisfaction and happiness. If you take care of the happiness of others your own happiness will be taken care of. There is a difference between mak - ing a life and making a living. The best lives are those who give the greatest service. Mr. Gould then said that he was present to give recognition to the splendid service which the county chairmen have rendered in their own counties. He wished that it might have been possible to recognize all those who deserve recognition for it would include the members of the county farm bureau boards, leaders of the 4-H clubs and pro - ject leaders. He then called the names of the following county chair - man: Cheyenne county — Mrs. Henry Yowell, Sidney. Deuel county — Mrs. Henry Bruss, Chappell. Keith county — Mrs. W. T. Mars, Sutherland. &gt; Kimball county — Mrs. H. L. Newlon, Kimball. Morrill county — Mrs. H. H. Huet, Angora. Perkins county — Mrs. Nellie Fletcher, Grant. Scottsbluff county — Mrs. Jack Godsey, Scottsbluff. As Mr. Gould called the names those who were present came forward. They were Mrs. Bruss, Mrs. Huet, and Mrs. Godsey. Mr. Gould read the "charge' which Mr. Brokaw had prepared after which he presented Mrs. Huet and Mrs. Godsey with the gold home demon - stration club leadership pins which are presented to each county chairman by the' Home Economics Section of Organized Agriculture. Mrs. Bruss had received one the year before at Alliance so was not given a second one at this time. The charge is as follows: "Your friends and neighbors have chosen you county chairman of home demonstration project work. They believe you to possess that ability to serve and that spirit of self sacrifice so necessary for successful leadership. "By this choice there devolves upon you that duty of inspiring your fellow workers with a loyalty to. service and a desire for achieve - ment of those things in home making and home life that are necessary for better agriculture and more complete living on Nebraska farms. "Your selection was an honor and privilege, but it also implied duties to perform and obligations to fill. Your regular duties have not prevented your meeting these tasks and we recognize that only busy people are successful leaders. By a faithful performance of your duties, you have inspired a confidence in you and a friendship for you that can only be secured by having been a friend to others and by a faithful performance of </seg>
            <seg id="p429">Nebraska home economics association obligations assumed. One Is not worthily a leader who Is not doing all In her power to enlighten her community by becoming, in so far as humanly possible, an example of right living and service to others. "While the work you have done and the goals achieved' are highly commendable, you have but entered into this field of leader - ship so essential to Agriculture's welfare and to national progress. Others may assume in the coming years your tasks of the present, but leadership accomplishments imply growth of the individual and point the way to broader fields. Do not misunderstand, that no field, ap - pearing to many a higher field or greater accomplishment, is more essential than the one you are filling now. "Your community, your county, your state, the nation, are ob - serving the character of your service. They will expect much of you and in this we are sure they will not be disappointed for into the hearts of all humans there has been implanted, and it depends only upon proper cultivation for growth, that desire for leadership so es - sential to an occupation such as ours and to the welfare of a Christ - ian, nation." After Mr. Gould's talk Miss Mary-Ellen Brown told the women about the "work sheets" which are filled out by the women who are nominated for Master Farm Homemakers. She based her remarks upon the score card which the judges use in selecting the winning nominees. This score card was prepared by the Farmer's Wife maga - zine people. It is as follows: </seg>

            <seg id="p431">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION • WHY CHILDREN BEHAVE AS THEY DO Ruth Staples We are sometimes Inclined to think that the way children act in inevitable, that their particular kind of behavior has been inherited from one or the other side of the family. If a child argues persist - ently, some people may say he "takes after his mother," or his quick temper may be referred to as an inheritance from his father. Forming Early Habits - Scientists today, however, believe that as far as character and personality traits are concerned, Inheritance is a minor factor, that, for the most part, children behave the way they do because they have learned to behave that way. It is true that children are born with a number of instincts, common to all human beings, and that they naturally show emotion, under certain situations. All babies are startled by loud, sudden noises and are angry when not allowed to move their arms and legs. Also some children have a greater natural ability for music, art, or school work than others. But these in - herited forms of behavior are very simple and serve merely as a foundation for later behavior.. The child who inherits a talent for music does not suddenly become capable of playing the violin, he merely has the kind of a nervous system which enables him to become an accomplished musician after years of ardent practice. In the same way, a child naturally enjoys the presence of other people, but he has to learn how to get along with them, if he is to turn out 'into a socially well adjusted adult. Such traits as persistence, independence, and love of achievement help constitute the character of what we call suc - cessful men and women, but these qualities have been learned, and are not magic traits passed on by their forebears. Life is largely the result of habits and attitudes built up in childhood, the parents are the first and the most important teachers. Since learning begins at birth, it is a poor plan to wait two or three years, before starting to teach the children good habits. Babies are going to learn, whether we direct their learning or not, and if they are not taught good habits, they will probably pick up unde - sirable ones. Poor habits of sleep and eating, habits of disobedience and untidiness in a child, show the lack of training by his parents. They are not unfortunate characteristics the child is born with. There are ways of teaching which have proven to be the most successful; certain laws which serve as a guide for building all kinds of habits in children and which apply equally well to health habits, to social habits and to emotional habits. </seg>
            <seg id="p432">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE - Trial and Error Learning Children need to have an opportunity to try things out for themselves and by trying this way and that, they finally succeed in discovering the best method. When they say, "let me do it," let them try. You will be surprised how well they succeed if you give them plenty of time, sufficient opportunity and a few good suggestions. Do not expect them to get things perfectly at first. They will make many mistakes, but this is part of the learning process. Gradually the wrong moves are eliminated and the' task is learned. ' This need for experimenting applies. to both learning such motor tasks as dress - ing one's self and to learning how to get along with other children. Experience is an excellent teacher. I Ijearning by Practicing By repeating an act again and again, it becomes firmly estab - lished as a habit in the individual. If the child always brushes his teeth before going to bed, it eventually becomes automatic, and he doesn't need to be told . to do it. If every night he puts away his toys, he will finally do it as a matter of course. If he always has to eat his vegetables before getting his dessert, he will soon learn that it is useless to refuse them. A hungry child will eat what is set before him if he knows that there is no way to get anything else. On the other hand, if we frequently allow exceptions to occur, if the child doesn't always, have to mind, if he doesn't have to take his nap every day, it will be so very difficult to teach him obedience, or to get him to nap when we wish him to do so. Learning by Pleasant and Unpleasant Results While practice in doing, a task is an exceedingly important rule for learning, the effect that the act has on the child is equally sig - nificant. If he experiences pleasure from what he is doing, he tends to repeat this act again, while if it brings about unpleasant results, he tends to avoid it. The baby who touches the hot stove will let it alone in the future. If, by crying and fussing, a child gets his own way, he will try it again and again, and the result is a whiney, fussy youngster. On the other hand, if the crying brings no satisfaction, he will soon stop trying it and give it up as useless. He may find that it pays to be cheerful and learn to greet the world with a smile. When children play together for the first time, they always want the same toys and are apt to grab and snatch from each other and zealously guard what they have secured. Soon, with frequent com - panionship of others of their own age, they learn that it is a lot more fun to have someone to play with, even if you have to give up your own way part of the time, and here we have the beginning of such character traits as willingness to cooperate and unselfishness. The child repeats again and again the behavior which . he finds brings. </seg>
            <seg id="p433">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION him satisfaction, if we wonder why our children fly Into temper tantrums when they can't have what they want, we can be sure they are getting some pleasure out of it, even If it is only the pleasure which comes with getting attention. It is natural for a child to he - come angry when thwarted, but a child can learn self control if the angry outburst brings no satisfaction, and if, when he does control himself, he wins the approval of those he loves and admires. ■ Learning: to Perform Tasks Little children tire easily, and find it difficult to keep their at - tention on any one thing for long. As they grow older, they con - centrate better and fatigue less easily. When the child is first learn - ing to lace his shoes or button his clothing, he should not be kept at it too long, if he buttons one or two buttons at first he will learn to dress himself more quickly than if he is given a great many buttons to do. Fatigue causes unpleasant association and even an aversion to just what you are trying to teach him. Children need to experience success in their work and in their play. If they are given tasks that are too difficult, not only do they learn less quickly, but they soon get discouraged and lose confidence in their own ability. On the other hand, if things are made too easy for them, they never learn what real effort is. The child learns more readily if he is interested in what he is doing. The reason children learn so much in their play is due to this factor of interest. They will work so hard to make the toy airplane and learn so much about putting things together, because it is something they are thoroly interested in. Let us take our cue from this, and make what we wish to teach the child so attractive that he is anxious to learn It takes considerable ingenuity to find ways of making things appeal to the child, but it is worth the effort. Suggestion and imitation, too, play a part, and the attitude of the adult often furnishes a model for the child. Only too often the child refuses spinach because his elders do, or reproduces a display of temper he has witnessed. If we are distressed over our children's behavior, it is advisable to study the whole situation and find out what is back of it. It is much more likely to be something in his environment, in the way he Is handled, than a matter of inheritance We should, therefore, think carefully about the way we handle the children, It is wiser to think out, ahead of time, what effect a certain procedure will have on the child; than to correct the results of poor management. </seg>
            <seg id="p434">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE FRIDAY FORENOON .Mrs. Henry Bruss, Presiding The meeting was called to order by Mrs. Bruss. Mrs. E. J. Stearley of Gering whistled the Blue Bird's Echo. Miss Rebekah Gibbons' talk was on "What's New in Nutrition." She said one of the new features of the nutrition work now is that we have come to really believe in it. We used to think it was good for others but did not apply it to ourselves. Her talk was based upon the following paper: WHAT'S NEW IN NUTRITION Dr. Rebekah Gibbons Without long and tedious study it is not possible for the average person to know exactly which of the nutritive essentials any par - ticular food will bring to the body. But there are many "family characteristics" which the members Of each group of foods have in common which may be easily remembered and put into constant use - in planning or choosing the day's meals. The discussion which follows presupposes a knowledge of the functions of the essentials of an adequate diet. Therefore, no dis - cussion will be attempted concerning the amount and quality of pro - tein needed at different ages; of the number of calories required under different conditions of activity nor of how we may know whether a sufficient number of calories is being supplied; of the requirement for calcium, phosphorus, iron and iodine; of the need for vitamins A, B, C, and D. We shall concern ourselves Instead with the contribu - tions made by the different groups of foods in supplying these dietary essentials and shall also discuss their failings with a view toward learning how .to overcome' the shortcomings of each. It more than pays to acquaint oneself with the contributions of the different foods to the diet for then after one or two rather simple essentials have been included the rest of the food may safely be chosen as fancy and taste dictate. Occasionally one or -more food dislikes must be overcome before all of the food may be selected to suit the individual palate, but the more one knows about food the more safely one may choose those foods which he prefers to meet a particular need, rather than being forced to follow iron clad rules in order to feel certain that the diet is adequate. One of the food groups which we meet in all sorts of disguises are the cereal grains and their products. We may eat them as bread, toast, cake, crackers, other bakery products, rice, canned corn, hominy, macaroni, breakfast cereals of all sorts both fresh, cooked or ready to serve and as thickening for puddings, sauces, etc. A meal is seldom served at which cereal products do not appear in some form or other. </seg>
            <seg id="p435">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION The cereals are so different in texture, flavor and color that we are frequently misled into believing that there are important differ - ences between them. Cornbread and white bread or oatmeal and wheat breakfast food are practically interchangeable, for instance. As a matter of fact, all of our cereals are much more alike than they are different. Dr. Taylor has expressed this cleverly when he says, "In comparing the cereals with one another we are apt to emphasize their differences, just as we would in comparing two people. We do not remark that both have eyes, we say rather, one's eyes are blue, an - other's brown, nor do we comment on both having vocal cords; we tell how one has a sweet voice while another's is gruff or strident. Any two men are more alike than a man and a dog, but we are so accustomed to the fact that it goes without saying. So we may first describe the dietary characteristics of the cereal family as we might describe the common traits of mankind as a class." There is more difference between any unrefined cereal (one from which the bran coat has not been removed) and any refined cereal than there is between the cereal products from different plants. For instance, white and graham flour differ more in composition than cracked wheat and oat meal. The chief contribution of the cereals to the diet is energy or calories and these are in a palatable, easily digested and inexpensive form. They also bring us a surprisingly large amount of protein cne of the body building materlals-^but it is of rather inferior quality and had better be supplemented by other protein from some animal source. The refined cereals, white flour and the products made from it crackers, macaroni, ordinary corn meal, rice and hominy and pearl barley, etc., bring us very little except the calories and protein which have been mentioned. The unrefined cereals have for us in addition an excellent store of iron and to a less extent phosphorus and vitamin H. We get more for our money from the cereals than from any other group of foods and more from the unrefined than from the refined ones. . . Our cereals, whether refined or unrefined, are very weak in cal - cium and the economical diet which will contain a large proportion ot cereal, must be carefully supplemented to supply this important mineral. Cereals are also entirely lacking in vitamin A and vitamin C. Let us then see what foods we shall use with our cheap cereals to provide a well balanced diet. We must have a food containing animal protein. If possible, this must also bring us calcium and vitamins A and C. Meat would supply the animal protein but it is not any better source of calcium than the cereals. It has some vitamin A, but when cooked is almost without vitamin C. We will, therefore, not choose meat if we can find something which will supply all of the deficiencies of the cereals. </seg>
            <seg id="p436">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Milk and cheese contain an animal protein of good quality. They are extremely rich in calcium and also have a' good supply of vitamin A. If a reliable source of raw milk is available it may have some vitamin C. Milk, therefore, supplies almost to perfection those food essentials in which the cereal products are deficient. Milk — the only food planned, by nature for the nourishment of animals— contains animal protein of good quality. It is an excellent source of calcium and very good for phosphorus and vitamin A but it is a poor source of iron and vitamin C. A pint of milk daily for adults and a quart for children will supply the calcium needed each day. Because of its weaknesses it must be accompanied by good sources of iron, such as green vegetables, dried fruits, whole cereals, eggs, legumes, (peas, beans, peanuts, etc.), meat, molasses, (not corn syrup), also by good sources of vitamin C such as fresh raw fruits and vegetables or cooked tomatoes. Meat, fish and eggs' are excellent sources of good quality protein. They are good sources of. iron and phosphorus and fair for vitamin IS. They are not good sources of vitamin C and have Very little cal - cium. Eggs have plenty of vitamin A but meat and fish have only a little. They must be used with milk or a few vegetables and fruits, (oranges, spinach, carrots, cauliflower, ' cabbage) , to make up for their weakness in calcium. Use fresh raw fruits and vegetables or cooked tomatoes to help out with vitamin C and use meat and fish with butter or green vegetables for vitamin A. There was a time when the fruits and vegetables were discrim - inated against because it seemed that they were relatively expensive. That was before it was recognized how essential a contribution the minerals and vitamins make to an adequate diet. It is now known that we get more minerals and vitamins for our money from the fruits and vegetables than from many other foods. Since as a rule they are not high in calories nor in protein, fairly large quantities of fruits and vegetables may be introduced into the diet without making it overly "heavy." It is wise to cultivate a wide circle of friends (those we like to eat) among them. Few fruits or vegetables contain out - standing amounts of phosphorus so we must supplement them with whole grain cereal products, legumes, milk or meat for this important mineral. Fruits and vegetables must also be used with foods which bring calories and protein to the diet. * The fats such as lard, vegetable oils, solid vegetable shortenings, butter, oleomargarine, cod liver oil, etc., do not bring any minerals or protein to the diet. They serve principally as sources of calories. Putter, some brands of oleomargarine, cod liver oil and a few other animal fats are valuable for the vitamin A which they contain. The vegetable fats do not contain vitamin A. It can be plainly seen that the fats must be supplemented on almost all the points which we consider in determining whether a diet is adequate or not. The diet would be very unpalatable and difficult to digest if it contained a </seg>
            <seg id="p437">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION great deal- of fat. In actual practice we use the fats to Increase the calories in the diet without making the meal too bulky. They also help to keep the food from digesting so fast that we become hungry before time for the next meal. Sugar and syrups also bring us little beside calories. Corn starch corn syrup and white sugar have nothing else for us. Cane molasses and to a less extent brown sugar have a very rich supply of calcium and iron. It is for this reason that molasses cookies are recommended for children. Both of these Bweeteners deserve to be used more widely than they are at present. Ginger-bread is easy to make and is a general favorite, and muffins or puddings containing molasses are usually popular. Sugar is a perfectly wholesome food. The ob - jections which are raised to the use of sugar and syrups are based on the fact that used to excess they may be somewhat irritating to the stomach. But a much more important consideration is that they may displace other foods which bring esential minerals, vitamins and pro - tein to the body along with their calories while sugar has calories alone to offer. Bearing in mind the food essentials which each "family" of foods brings to the diet and those in which they are weak one may plan an adequate diet from a very limited number of foods— if the right ones are chosen. For instance, milk and whole grain cereal products will make a pretty, well-balanced ration. The addition of a little fresh fruit will make it entirely satisfactory. A person could live very comfortably on whole wheat bread and butter, milk and a little fresh fruit. We usually prefer, however, to have a bit more variety in the diet. If care is used, well balanced meals may be chosen containing almost any foods which fancy, the market, or the pocket book dictates We can not have a hit or miss combination of these foods on any given day, however. We must see to It that all of the foods chosen do not have the same weak points but that each food supplements the others. The reason for the rules for planning an adequate diet and how the dietary plans with which we are all so familiar actually work out should now be clear. The pint or quart of milk provides enough calcium so that no further thought Heed be given to this factor. There are few other good sources of this mineral and it Is largely for this reason that the milk is so important. Milk also makes a good start on the protein phosphorus and vitamin A requirement. For some other source of good protein we had better choose a food rich in Iron altho cheese may be used If the iron Is safeguarded elsewhere. This other protein food might be eggs, meat, legumes or nuts. Any of these will help out the phosphorus. Too much of these protein foods may be unde - sirable, therefore, the amount is best limited to two servings. The iron will still need attention and so we include at least two vegetables, preferably three. One of these may be potato. Our green vegetables-^splnach and other greens, snap beanB, asparagus, peas, </seg>
            <seg id="p438">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE cabbage, lettuce, etc., will be' especially, good sources of vegetable iron, and most of them will contribute needed vitamin A. Our fruits will also help with the iron and so we plan for at least one serving of fruit but preferably for two servings. Prunes, figs, dates, raisins, are fruits rich in iron. The diet may still be weak in both phosphorus and iron and for tiiat reason unrefined cereal or legumes should be included unless one prefers to use greater amounts of the other foods rich in these essentials. The need for vitamin C will not yet have been supplied ' unless one of the fruits or vegetables has been used raw or unless tomato has been served. To summarize: An adequate diet will be provided by using the following plan. Substitutions may be made only if care is exercised to be sure that no dietary essential is omitted. Have as a minimum each day 1 pt. milk (adults), 1 quart milk (children) 2 other good sources of protein 2 vegetables, preferably 3 Some unrefined cereal Something fresh and raw or tomatoes. If these common, simple rules are followed, the remainder of the food, in quantity sufficient to meet the energy requirement, may be safely selected according to taste or convenience. Mrs. Bruss selected a nomination committee consisting of Mrs. Jack Godsey of Scotts Bluff county, Mrs. Josie Hallquist of Deuel county, and Mrs. Burk of Cheyenne county. The report made by this committee was Mrs. Henry Bruss of Chappell for president, Mrs. Leonard Wilson of Kimball county as vice-plresident, and the secretary to be the county chairman of extension project work in which ever county the next meeting is to be held. The report of. the nominating committee was accepted and these officers declared elected. Mrs. Bruss next led in a round table discussion on the list of statements which had been used in the Mothers Vacation Camps. A pencil was given to each woman and she was asked to place a check mark after the statements as they were read to indicate whether the statement was true, doubtful or false. The complete list of statements was read be - fore there was any discussion, then the women were asked how many voted true for the first statement, and the number of hands was counted, how many checked doubtful, how many false. .

Miss Staples gave another talk on "Constructive Discipline for Little Children." Following is a copy of her talk: </seg>
            <seg id="p441">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION CONSTRUCTIVE DISCIPLINE FOR LITTLE CHILDREN Ruth Staples Control by adults Is necessary for little children, in order to provide for their safety and well being. The little child has no more knowledge of the foods that are essential for building a strong body than he has of the dangers of the city street. But, just as we expect the child to eventually provide for his own needs, and to care for himself, so must we expect him to become independent in his conduct. tn the early years children must conform to their parents' wishes, they must learn that to do certain things doesn't pay. But gradually they must learn to control their own behavior, they must learn not to refrain from doing this or that because of fear of punishment, but because they really believe It is the right thing to do. Guiding prin - ciples and standards of conduct must be developed. Self discipline aiul self guidance by the child should be the goal toward which par - ents are working. Of course, it is much easier to simply tell the children what they must, or must not do, but it doesn't build for the future. Constructive discipline begins in babyhood. The baby who is brought up with a regular schedule of feeding and sleeping is learn - ing his first lessons in obedience. He finds that it doesn't pay to scream and kick. He must conform to his mother's wishes, just as later he must conform to law and order. Much of this training in regularity will carry over, past babyhood, Into childhood. It is much easier to teach a little child to come in when you call him, or to put .his toys away, if, during babyhood he has had to abide by regular hours. If he was fed whenever he cried, it will be harder for him to learn, later on, that crying will not get him his own way. How to Teach Children to be Obedient Secure the Child's Attention With little children and with older children, too, success in se - curing obedience rests largely on the method of giving commands. The first step is to secure the child's attention.- When you are sure he is listening to you, tell him what you wish him to do. Don't Ask too Much Commands should be few in number. If a child is constantly ordered about, and told to do this or stop doing that forty times a day, he gets rebellious and obstinate. Moreover, he soon stops paying attention to whoever handles him in this way, because he must have some freedom. Ask only what is really necessary of the children. Do away with constant nagging and supervision. Save your com - mands for the things that really matter. 15 </seg>
            <seg id="p442">Report of Nebraska state board of agriculture! Be Reasonable in Dealing with Children What you ask of the children should always be reasonable. A child should be allowed as much freedom as his stage of development warrants. Being over-solltious of his welfare, being' afraid to let him do this and that, forbidding him to do what the rest of the children of his age do with apparent safety is most unreasonable, and leads to failure in later social adjustment. It is a serious thing to make a child feel different. In any way, from his little companions. It is wise, also, to explain the reasons for our requests and re - strictions. Some people fear that reasoning with a child will make him argue. But treating him like an intelligent human being isn't going to do this. The child who learns to argue is the one who is accustomed to changing his parents' decision by his arguing. He has found that an argument pays, it frequently brings about a re - versal of the command. Be Consistent in What You Ask Being consistent is another basic factor in good discipline. If a parent is strict one day and lenient the next, the child will never know what is really expected of him and will try to do about what ho pleases. He will not learn to hang up his wraps if one day you make him do it, and the next day do it yourself. Both parents should jet together and come to an agreement as to what they are going to demand of the children. If they dispute before them, about mat - ters of discipline, if they differ in what they permit the children to do, the youngsters soon take advantage of the situation and go from one parent to the other, according to their leniency. Such sort of treatment is not constructive. It is not a help in building char - acter. It does not form standards of conduct, that will guide the child in the future, but teaches him to get around the law, if there 13 a way out. See that Commands Yon Give are Carried Out This is the most important factor in securing obedience. Telling the child to do a certain thing and not Insisting that he does it, soon shows him that you do not really mean what you say. It is not necessary to raise the voice, and shout your command louder and louder. Firmness and calmness are the attitudes the parents should assume, and they are attitudes the child soon learns. to re - spect. ■ ■ The rules to be observed, in teaching children habits of obed - ience may be summed up as follows: 1. Secure the child's attention. 2. Get his interest and cooperation. Don't fight with him as if you were another child, but make him willing to obey. 3. Make the commands reasonable, and few in number. </seg>
            <seg id="p443">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION 4. Be consistent. 5. Remember that the child's personality should be respected. 6. Build for the future, by teaching your child to discipline himself. But how, you ask, does one build for the future? How teach obedience to principles, instead of to persons. The answer is this: By giving the child opportunity to make conscious choices, by letting him have practice in making decisions for himself. Talk things over with him, explaining carefully and with sympathy, just why his con - duct was undesirable, and how some other form of behavior would have been better. All this takes time, and is not learned in a week or a. year, but, if the training is begun early, and kept up through - out childhood, we have the young man or woman who has principles to guide himself by, when he leaves home and must rely upon his own judgment. ■ Punishment The purpose of punishment is to attack an unpleasant effect to the form of behavior we do not wish to be repeated. A certain amount of punishment is unavoidable, especially with very young children. To be effective, it must be prompt, and to avoid develop - ing resentment and sullenness, it must not be too prolonged. It must be well suited to the offense, and within the understanding of the child, and it must differ, with individual children. What, to one, is almost nothing, might be taken very seriously by another. If possible, the punishment should be the natural consequence of the misdeed. One little boy who, in a fit of anger, stamped his brother's crayons into the living room rug, had to clean it up, and spent his saved up pennies for some new ones. This was a much more effective punishment than a spanking, and Incidentally he learned something about property rights. Isolation is a very effective punishment for most children. They love to be with others, but they must learn that if they are unkind and selfish, no one will want them around. Depriving them of some pleasure, provided it is in keeping with the magnitude of the offense, is another method of discipline. Most people who have made a study of the behavior of children, believe that spanking has little place, as a form of punishment. Parents usually administer spankings be - cause it is the easiest punishment to think of and it is a way of giving vent to their own feelings. Other means of control are usually more effective in the long. run, as well as being a greater help to the child, in guiding his future conduct. If the five-year-old dallies with his dressing and consequently misses going down town with his father, he learns that he misses a lot if he is late and Inconsiderate of others. The next time, he will want to dress quickly. If we are not careful, certain types of punishment will have very unfortunate results on the personality of the child. Children </seg>
            <seg id="p444">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE who are very severely punished may become afraid not only of the ones who discipline them, but of taking any initiative. They do not dare go ahead, for fear it may not be met with approval. They lose confidence in their ability to do anything the right way. Some . children resort to lying, as a means of escape from severe punish - ment. If children fail to understand just why they have to be scolded or punished, or if the punishment to them seems harsh and unjust, they often become sullen and resentful. The parent who gives well thought out commands will seldom need to resort to punish - ment. To punish, it will he remembered, means to make undesirable behavior unsatisfactory to the child. While this type of discipline has Us place, to make desirable behavior satisfactory is a more con - structive method. This Is especially true if discipline is thought of, not as making the child do what his elders want him to do, just be - cause they say so — or "to teach him who is the boss," but to teach him how to discipline himself in such a way that he will grow up to be a desirable member of a family, and a, good citizen. .

            <seg id="p447">PROCEEDINGS OP THE Nebraska State Horticultural Society SIXTY-FIRST ANNUAL REPORT TUESDAY MORNING SESSION JANUARY 7, 1930 The Sixty-first Annual Convention of the Nebraska Horticultural Society met in Room 106, Plant Industry Building of the Agricultural College, Lincoln, Nebraska, and was called to order at 9:30 A. M. by the President, Mr. Vernon Marshall, of Arlington, Nebraska. Members of the Nebraska State Horticultural Society, Ladies and Gentlemen: It seems that it is customary for your Chairman to make a few remarks at the opening of this annual meeting and I have prepared a few notes that I will read to you at this time. First, I wish to say that it is with great pleasure that I greet you at this, the opening session of the Sixty-first Annual Meeting of the Nebraska State Horti - cultural Society and I wish you all happiness and success in your endeavors in 1930. In digging through the old reports of the proceedings of this Society, looking for material upon which to base my discussion today, I was struck with the marked change that has come over the subject matter for discussion on our programs in the past twenty years. On the program of the forty-flrst Annual Meeting of this Society, held January 18. 1910, the following subjects were discussed: Growing Raspberries; Growing and Marketing Grapes; Growing and Pruning Grapes; Horticultural Opportunities for the Tenant Farmer; Recent Advancement in Horticulture; How we grew and marketed 12,000 bushels of apples; Guarding against frosts and freezes with emudges and heaters; etc. </seg>
            <seg id="p448">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE These subjects were ably discussed by men who -were acknowl - edged authorities and such men and the Ideas they gave to meetings of this nature were responsible for the planting of the virgin prairies of Nebraska into profitable orchards and vineyards until now Nebraska is recognized as a state which has several thousands of acres of apple orchards and grape vineyards as well as a considerable acreage of other small fruits, grown commercially in addition to thousands of small plantings of fruits by the home owners of the state. The quality of the fruit grown in Nebraska has ever been fully as good as the fruit grown in any of the other fruit sections of the United States and it seems to me that the only way in which we have failed to take full advantage of the opportunities which have been bestowed upon us by nature in productive soil, suitable climatic conditions, etc., is that we have not advertised our wares to the world as much as we should. If the people of Nebraska had the inclination and rhetorical ability to shout our wares to the housetops as does the native son of California, in . particular, and of the Pacific Coast States in general, Nebraska would be much better known and appreciated as a fruit growing state. And now let me draw your attention, for comparison, to the pro - gram which we have before us at this session; New and promising ornamental shrubs and trees; Superlative plants for the Garden; A successful yard and garden contest; My experiences with perennials; Planting the small lot; How to build a pool; Plants suitable for pools and rock gardens; etc. We find one whole day devoted to the dis - cussion of these subjects, by men who have made a thorough study of their subject matter and who have come long distances to appear before us and these subjects have been placed upon the program because of the widespread interest manifested by the people of our state in knowing more about materials for and methods of, beautify - ing their home surroundings. It is but natural that after a com - munity or section of a new country has been settled for a good many years and the people have built better homes as their means would permit, that they should begin to think of improvements that they can make in their home surroundings and they become interested in things of an ornamental nature. A few shade trees, and then some shrubs about the foundation of the house and further development of the back yard into a private lawn containing a pool or rockery or some garden furniture, etc. People travel a great deal now days and in other sections of the country, they see entire foundation plantings of evergreens which: have the added advantage over shrubs of having a much better winter effect and so they become interested in ever - greens and find that most varieties of evergreens do very well here in Nebraska, which together with the great many varieties of trees and shrubs that do well here, makes the beautiful home here in this prairie country quite as beautiful and nearly as easily planned, planted and cared for as it would in other parts of the country. </seg>
            <seg id="p449">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY And now I will review briefly, the various activities ol this Society for. the past year. At the annual meeting of the Board in June, it was decided to hold a summer tour through the vineyard and orchard sections of Southeastern Nebraska, as has been done in the past, but owing to late freezes and adverse weather conditions ex - perienced in that section which- resulted in an unusually heavy drop of fruit, it was later decided to call off this meeting since the Board felt that the fruit crop would not look very good to the visitors who would make this trip. The Society, under the planning and direction of Secretary Hoppert and his assistants made a very fine showing at the State Fair and the Nurserymen of the state working in co-opera - tion with the Society also had an educational exhibit of shrubs and evergreens which was of great interest to the visitors at the fair. Secretary Hoppert also arranged to make a display of fruit for the Society at the Diamond Jubilee Ak-Sar-Ben Stock Show at the Ak-Sar-Ben Coliseum in Omaha and a unique and very attractive dis - play was placed there where hundreds of people were again reminded of what the State of Nebraska can do in the raising of fruit. Our Secretary, Mr. Hoppert, also made a trip back Into Illinois, as a part of his vacation, and studied the problems confronting the growers there, especially to find out what he could about the Oriental Fruit Moth and will give us an address on this subject later on in our program. Furthermore our Society decided to become affiliated as a society with the National Horticultural Congress. The purposes of this or - ganization are to guard the interests of fruit growing in this country. It has helped to secure representation of the growers in the fixing of tariff rates on fruits and vegetables. I think our Secretary will report further on some of this organization's accomplishments. Today's program will be devoted to' Landscape Gardening. The first number is "New and Promising Ornamental Shrubs and Trees" by Charles Andrews of Arlington. Mr. Andrews is in charge of the Landscape Department of the Marshall Nursery at Arlington. I take pleasure in introducing to you Mr. Charles Andrews. NEW AND PROMISING ORNAMENTAL SHRUBS AND TREES CHAS. ANDREWS, Arlington, Nebr. Mr. Chairman, Members of the Society and Friends: I wish to say that I have the average planter In mind in making the following remarks. I will refer to some trees and shrubs that are just coming into use in the state; some that have been available here only for a short time with which the general public are not familiar; </seg>
            <seg id="p450">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE and some that, while they are not new, new uses in plantings are being made of them. First as to deciduous trees, I will suggest Chinese Elm .(Ulmus pumila) Moline Elm (Ulmus: Moline) • . Pyramidal Soft Maple (Acer: Blair) Hopa Crab (Malua: Hopa) Red Oak (Quercus rubra) We have been hearing about Chinese Elm for some time from the North Platte Agricultural Station and elsewhere, but we have just gotten to the point where the planter can get the trees. While larger trees are not so plentiful, yet "shelter belt" sizes are easier to secure It is an unknown tree to the average Nebraskan, and, as it is so useful I will say something about it. It is especially adapted to dry plains. It grows very rapidly al - most as fast as Cottonwood. If let go, it limbs low and makes a splendid windbreak and does it quickly; in fact, some call it the "hurry up tree." Then if trimmed and grown into a tree it makes a very good ornamental shade tree, with its slender, almost wiry branches and beautiful small leaves. It comes in leaf very early in the spring and holds its foliage late in the fall, which adds to Its value as a shade and ornamental tree. It withstands wind and sleet being slow to break. Take it all in all, it gives the best promise for this territory of any tree yet introduced. Six foot trees planted at the nursery In the spring of 1928 now stand 12-14 feet high. Trees at North Platte about 14 years old are 38-40 feet high and beautiful trees. Bridge - port, Nebraska, has Chinese Elm all over town. One tree there 10 years old was 14 inches in caliper and 45 feet high. I consider it the best tree they have there. It seems to have no enemies and since it stands the drouth and heat and cold so well. I don't see why it will not live a hundred years. The Moline Elm Is a grafted tree, therefore, all trees are exactly alike. The leaves are a little larger than most of the Elms and stay on the tree longer. The tree has a smooth bark, and has an upright habit of growth. The original tree is in Moline, Illinois, hence Its name. Because of its particular shape and the fact that every tree will be alike. It is especially adapted for street and avenue planting I would say that it would probably grow in height' about the same as our ordinary Elm. The Pyrimidal Soft Maple is also a selected tree propagated by grafting, it is upright in habit of growth. The tops will vary in shape in seedling trees. We have propagated a stock of such trees from an original at Blair, Nebr, In this way every tree is like every other tree. </seg>
            <seg id="p451">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY The Hopa Crab is a beautiful ornamental tree -that can be raised anywhere in the state. In the spring the buds are red and open out into single rose flowers .In profusion. The tree attracts attention when iii bloom. The bloom is followed by a small red fruit which is also ornamental. It can be placed out in the yard or among shrub borders and will grow to a height of about 25 feet. This tree is one of the hybrids produced by Professor Hansen of South Dakota. Now, for the last tree in this list, the Red Oak. This isn't a new tree. No, for it grows native in eastern Nebraska, but it is used so little, and, as I think it is such a valuable tree, I wish to mention it. The tree grows faster and transplants easter than other native oaks. It is a large, stately tree, 50 to 100 and more feet in height, with columnar trunk and round symmetrical head of stout spreading branches. The leaves are often nine inches long and six inches broad. The furrowed bark has a reddish-brown color. One can certainly enjoy the brilliant coloring of the autumn foliage. Now, for a list, of shrubs I will mention: Redleaf Japanese Barberry (Barberris thunbergi atropurpureus) ' - - . White Belle Honeysuckle (Lonlcera bella albida) Virginal Mockorange (Philadelphia virginalis) Boquet Blanc Mockorange (Philadelphia: Boquet Blanc) Winged Euonymua (Euonymus ala'tus) Beauty bush (Kolkwitzla amabills) Desbois Weigela (Weigela desboisis) Nodding Lilac (Syringa reflexa) Hugonis Rose Hybrid Rugosa Roses The Japanese Barberry is a common shrub. It is a shrub useful in most every grounds and easily grown in most of the state. Red - leaf Japanese Barberry is a sport of this plant. When the Japanese Barberry has a green leaf during the summer, the Redleaf variety is red, 'purplish-red, or greenish red. It should be planted in the sunlight or it will not color well. This is a new shrub. White Belle Honeysuckle is a tall upright growing Honeysuckle bush, not so well known, but very useful. It will grow under adverse conditions and grows fast, making it adaptable in a hedge or grouping for screening purposes and for quick effect. The foliage is a good green, coming early and staying late. The flowers are not so good but are followed by very pretty red berries. It grows to a height of ten to twelve feet. There are several new varieties of Mockorange. Virginal Mock - orange stands out as an excellent variety with Its early crop of large semi-double white flowers in June that are fragrant, followed later on with another small crop of bloom.

Boquet Blanc Mock - orange is very similar and perhaps is considered by some as good. Winged Euonymus is not a new shrub, but is one coming into more favor in the west. A good many people, when they 8 ee the shrub, want it. It has a good green foliage which turns a beautiful rose color in the fall. Its cork bark Is interesting throughout the year. It grows around 8 feet in height. The Beautybush has been disseminatel from the Arnold Arbore - tum and is being praised highly In the east. Some of the mid-west nurseries are now growing it as it shows promise. It is a very grace - ful shrub covered with small pink blooms in May and grows 6 to 8 feet tall and about as wide. We cannot say much yet as to its hardi - ness in Nebraska. Desbois Weigela is similar to the ordinary Pink Weigela, except that the flowers are a more clear pink and not so much light color in the bloom. Nodding Lilac is a late blooming Lilac of the villosa type. It grows large and must be given plenty of room to develop. The bush blooms after the ordinary Lilacs and the flowers are pink and good for cutting. It is hardy. I have included Rose bushes as shrubs. I do so, because they should be grown in the yard as such. Any bush rose that is hardy can be used In the shrub border. Hugonis Rose is a comparatively new bush that grows 6 to 8 feet tall with a showy bloom of single yellow flowers before other roses bloom. The Single Rugosa Roses have been used for some time as bushes in plantings, as well as some of the hybrid or double forms. Hansa is a good double red. P. J. Grootendorst is a good red in baby rambler-like clusters. Then there is a new pink Grootendorst. The Rugosas bloom all summer. They have a. rich glossy green, crinkled foliage and grow to a height of around six feet, although most people probably keep them cut back each season so as to keep the bushes small and more bushy at the base. Now, I wish to refer to a list of Evergreens. While all are called trees, some are of dwarfish habit and are used as shrubs, especially with the increasing demand for evergreen foundation plantings. While some of these are not new, this new use for them, is my reason for mentioning them. Colorado Juniper (Juniper us scopulorum) It is called Colorado Juniper because its range extends Into Colo - rado and other western states. But, in the Black Hills, trees of the most striking beauty are found. There are. some growing in western Nebraska. </seg>
            <seg id="p453">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY The native trees grow in various shapes, from low spreading up to pyrlmldal to several Column varieties. There are around eight distinct types being grown in the nurseries, selected on account of shape of tree and color of foliage. . In the fall months the berries begin to appear, some of them clear sky-blue, others darker, and silver colored. The berries, one - eighth inch in diameter, are borne abundantly and are very attractive to the song-birds. The color ranges from green to light blue, most trees having a silvery-blue color. The color Is more pronounced during hot weather. The variety sold most at this time is narrow, compact and symmetrical. It has one single stem, in contrast to some varieties of Junipers with several stems. This makes it safe from heavy snows and winds. The inner foliage remains a good, healthy color through the tree. It can be used in foundation plantings, borders, groups, masses or individually. Its narrow habit of growth also makes it desirable in formal plantings or wherever a narrow Evergreen is needed.. It can be kept sheared as desired. Globe Colorado Juniper This is a variety sheared into a globe in the nursery and to be kept in such shape by the planter at the size desired. Sliver Colorado Juniper This is a selected form of striking light-blue foliage. It is the whitest blue Juniper obtainable. .The silvery foliage is magnificent as it sparkles in the sun. The color is brightest in the summer months but it is attractive all seasos. This can be obtained in pyramidal and narrow pyramidal trees. Chinese Juniper (Juniperus chlnensis) Only recently is the true merit of this tree being realized and its popularity greatly Increased. ; There is considerable difference in the outline of the tree among different specimens planted from seed. They run from broad bushy pyramidal to narrow pyramidal to real narrow pyramidal forms. The majority run to the broader specimens. As a general rule it is said that the trees run about 15 to 20 feet in height, with a diameter of three feet. The leaves are lance-shaped, sharp, pointed, channeled on the upper side and convex below, sometimes very glaucous or bright green, while some of the needles have very short, scale-like formations, com - mon in Junipers. It is comparatively rapid in growth. Three years experience with it makes us think it will be hardy in Nebraska, yet we only now recommend it as a promising variety. </seg>
            <seg id="p454">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Column Chinese Juniper (Junlperus chinensls pyramldalis) There are two distinct forms of this tree, one having green foli - age, the other, blue foliage. This tree reaches approximately 20 feet in height when fully grown. It is an extreme narrow type — like an exclamation point. Such a shaped tree will fill certain needs in land - scape worn., such as formal plantings, sentinels, or accent trees. It makes one think of the Italian Cypress that grows in the south and on the west coast. It is said to do well in almost any situation except in a too shady' location or damp ground. Now, here is a list of dwarf evergreens, some new, most of them not so new, but strangers to the average Nebraskan. They will all do well here. Pfitzer Juniper (Juniperus chinensls pfitzeriana) This variety is becoming very popular due to its ability to thrive in all parts of the country and under almost any condition of. soil or exposure. The usual practice in growing this tree in nurseries is to allow the tree to form a low, broad, irregular form. Some are trained up - ward and staked whereby they assume a more upright habit. The original tree is said to have reached about 12 feet In height and about the same diameter. By shearing, they can be kept as small as wanted and easily confined close quarters. Some strains are bluish in color, but the strain mostly used is a deep green color with a grayish cast and having a strong, vigorous type of foliage. It is the most popular of the dwarfs. Spiny Greek Juniper (Juniperus excelsa stricta) This beautiful variety forms a dense, narrow, conical head taper - ing gradually from the ground to a sharp terminal point, and is of a fine glaucous color. The growth is so slow that the tree is well adapted for founda - tion plantings, rock gardens, or other situations where small or dwarf trees are required. The small bushy trees in the nursery row look like a finished product and makes this variety popular. Mugho Pine (Pinus man tan a mughus) The old definition of "short and stout and round-about" fits the Mugho Fine. Recently a selected strain of seed has produced a true, many-stemmed, low-branched, dwarf type. Evergreens on the higher mountains and in cold countries have, naturally, a harder fight for existence, and, in common with other species, become dwarfed. The more inhospitable and windswept the </seg>
            <seg id="p455">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY locality, the smaller the trees become, until, at length, one gets a prostrate shrub. In such rugged surroundings is the home of the Mugho Pine. • ■ It never grows over 4 to 5 feet tall, but spreads out 6, 8 or more feet in diameter when full grown. By annual shearing it can be kept as small as desired. The color is deep gredn in summer and winter. It is an outstanding variety. Savin Juniper (Juniperus sablna) A low, many branched shrub, usually growing not over 2 or 3 feet high, but sometimes reaching a larger size in old trees. Its branches are spreading, dense, thickly covered with branchlets and heavily clothed with short, tufted foliage. The color is dark green at all seasons of the year. Its berries are blackish-purple or dark violet in color, some smooth and shining, some glaucous or powdery, all of them, small, round, or oval, about the size of small currants. Planted 4 to 6 feet apart, it forms an excellent border to larger evergreens in the background. It is' also desirable as a low tree in foundation groups and beds of evergreens in general. It does well in smoky atmospheres. Can be easily trimmed and kept small. Tamari.v Savin Juniper (Juniperus sabina tamariscifolia) A variety of Savin Juniper, the unusual feature being its fine f texture of foliage. It is named Tamarix because of the resemblance which the foliage bears to the well-known shrub of that name. In general formation, both in habit and size, it is similar to the other creeping forms, but is usually a somewhat smaller grower, reaching considerable less size. It is vigorous in habit and forms a compact, perfect mat of light green color, which it retains throughout the year. Von Enron Juniper (Juniperus nabina von ebron) An interesting and rare variety very seldom seen in nurseries. It has a compact, pretty, low form, bearing both juvenile and adult foliage. Branches are upright and wide-spreading. Has a tendency to make very irregular growth so that it is very picturesque and thus especially suited for rockeries. Creeping Juniper (Juniperus horizontalis) Grows flat on the ground. Has a whipcord Juniper foliage, where - as the foliage on some other ' creepers is a prickly, needle-shaped foliage. A tree may be six feet In diameter and not over six inches high. They can be trimmed easily. </seg>
            <seg id="p456">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Waukegan Juniper (Juniperus horizontaUs douglasi) A variety of Creeping Juniper that has practically the same ap - pearance in the summer, but in the fall the foliage takes on a bluish color which lasts during the winter. Andorra Juniper (Juniperus communis depressa plumosa) A good novelty of exceptional merit— a most satisfactory low - growing variety. It does not cling to the ground so closely as some of the other creeping forms. It lifts its branches about 18 inches off the ground, and for this reason, fills a somewhat different need in landscape work. Its outstanding feature is the unusual color. As soon as the frost comes in the fall, it changes to a rich, purple-bronze color. This is not the brownish winter color like our Red Cedar but a real reddish - purple color, entirely distinct in this respect from all other evergreens. During the spring and summer it is bright green. It would be wise to show pictures of these plants while giving these descriptions. Better yet, would be the living trees and shrubs, but since this is impossible I have had to describe them as best I could. I thank you. •; THE PRESIDENT: Are there any questions any of you would like to ask Mr. Andrews? MR. DUNMAN: We have had very poor success transplantinc red oak. Have you discovered a secret in making them grow? Most of us would be disappointed with red oak. MR. ANDREWS: Red oak must not be dug in the fall If transplanted early in spring directly from the nursery, and small trees used, a fair degree of success can be expected. PRESIDENT MARSHALL: If there are no other questions that you care to ask Mr. Andrews we will continue with our program but we will vary somewhat from the printed program. Instead of hearing Mr. Holtes now we will hear from Mr. Jacob Sass of Bennington. Mr. Sass is a well known iris and peony breeder and judge of national reputation. Some of you have heard him tell us at a previous meet - ing of this society some of his and his brother Hans' experiences in the organization of new varieties of iris. Today he is going to tell us the names of some of the other perennials that he has tried out. I take pleasure in introducing to you Mr. Jacob Sags. MR. JACOB SASS: Though my experiences with the iris and peony have been much more varied and greater than those with other perennials, still I have tried out nearly all of the different perennials recommended for this section and a great many that were not recom - mended for this section.

If there are none we will continue with the next number on the program. There has been a great deal of interest in fixing up yards both in the towns and in the country. Never in our history has there been such widespread interest. Many civic clubs and garden clubs are interested in making their . local communities more attrac - tive. Yard and garden contests can be sponsored to arouse general interest. Our next speaker, Mr. N. F. Guernsey, who is a Landscape Architect in Sioux City, will tell us how he held a successful yard and garden contest in Sioux City. Mr. Guernsey. "A SUCCESSFUL YARD AND GARDEN CONTEST" By NEWELL F. GUERNSEY, Landscape Architect, Sioux City, Iowa. Just before the war, in 1914, the Rotary Club of Davenport, Iowa, began experimenting with an idea. They wanted a more attractive city — not only a better place to work and live, — but one which their sons and daughters would also be contented to live in. They also believed that an attractive city would encourage new Industries and attract more citizens. Consequently Davenport would prosper. Perhaps they had seen evidences of this on the west coast. Who has not heard the music of western Pied Pipers, who sing to prospective tourists about the beauties of their land? Every year, thousands answer to the call, and behold, the result. At any rate, these Rotarians were determined to make Davenport a beautiful city. Their "Paint-up, Clean-up" weeks have convinced them that here was the basis of a great idea. People had not only cleaned up their </seg>
            <seg id="p460">RErORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE yards and painted their homes, — but in a larger way, this created stronger community spirit. The magic spell of removing old tin cans and ashes from their accumulations of years, had had its effect. Freshly painted homes made the whole town more attractive in ap - pearance. The people of Davenport were "all dressed up, with no place to go." It must have been fun to think out a new idea, which was to carry this movement still further. They called it a "Yard and Garden Contest." Their object was to encourage not only the cleanest, but the most beautiful grounds and gardens. They believed that home owners would soon catch the spirit, — and later would demand civic beautification on a still greater scale. They probably did not realize that their simple idea would soon spread over many other cities of America; that they had established a national movement, which was to grow into unlimited proportions. Some of you have undoubtedly had experience. in trying out this movement in your home towns. Last year, we tried it for the first time in Sioux City. This morning, we have time for only a small part of the experiences we encountered. Before going further, I will give you the name and address of the national secretary of this movement, so that If you care to, you may supplement this brief information by writing to him for some of his literature: George M. Sheets, managing director, Yard and Garden Contest Association, 111 East Third St., Davenport, Iowa. Our local Garden Club happened to be the instigator of this movement in Sioux City, — as one of six or seven of their major pro - jects. Our committee in charge of the Yard Contest, decided to appeal to the newspapers for help with its publicity. We have two local papers. The first question was, whether to ask both papers to help us — or to use only one paper. After much argument, we decided to present the matter first to the Sioux City Journal. . Imagine our surprise, to find that this paper would not only give us the publicity we asked, — but would go still further. They im - mediately appreciated the good-will advertising possibilities, — and agreed to sponsor the whole movement, calling It the Sioux City Journal-Garden Club Yard and Garden ' Contest. We must give this paper a large proportion of credit for whatever success has come to us in our first year effort. They practically 'managed two contests,— the "Hollyhock Contest," intended to make Hollyhocks our city flower; and the "Yard and Garden Contest." We advertised for entries during the spring, receiving about 250 in the Yard and Garden Contest. There were divided into three classes, — those doing all of their own work; those hiring part work done; and those hiring professional help. Fully- 80% of the entries were in Class No. 1, who do all of their own work. </seg>
            <seg id="p461">Nebraska state horticultural society Entries closed May 31st, and early In June we began preliminary judging. 'We found that a simple method was to organize teams of three, each team visiting .about twenty homes. All of our preliminary judges were women. We chose them from the Garden Club, from the Woman's Club, the Junior League, etc., and practically all of them seemed to enjoy the idea very much. Each team was furnished with a score card, and detailed in - structions about scoring. The front yard received 25 points for a perfect score; the back yard received 60 points; the alley 10 points; and parking 5 points, making 100 points total. I have brought a few of the score cards along, also some of our large score sheets, which explain in more detail, the system of scoring. (Will have this for you Tuesday morning.) We found that some teams scored higher than others — therefore we placed only the first four or five cards of each team in the final judging, which took place in August. Final judging of the best fifty gardens, was done by two teams, one team for Class No. 1; and one for Classes No. 2 and No. 3. The final teams were composed of mem - bers selected for artistic ability, and were selected by the City Plan - ning Commission, the Park Department, the Garden Club and Chamber of Commerce. In our first year of contest, we have noticed results all over town. People are talking about Sioux City and its possibilities of beauty. The material published by the Journal, all through the contest, has been widely read. It has benefited hundreds who did not enter the con - test. Next year, we hope for still greater results. We are planning to extend this movement over three to five years, before results begin to appear on a large scale. We have believed it wise to begin in a small way, — rather than try too much at first. Next year, we will divide the city into six districts, — with local prizes in addition to sweepstakes for the city at large. We are also organizing Junior Garden Clubs as part of our program, — in fact the Sioux City Journal is promoting all of the Interests of the Garden Club. The national slogan "You win if you lose" has encouraged many to try their hand at gardening, with the result of better health and more enjoyment in life, even though they fail to win a prize in the contest itself. Its purpose, "to make America a more beautiful and fruitful nation" will constantly find more citizens who are willing to lend a hand in their own communities, to carry on this great purpose. PRESIDENT MARSHALL: The next number on our program will be Mr. Alfred C. Hottes. Mr. Hottes was formerly Professor of Flori - culture at Ohio State University. At present he is associate editor of the Meredith publication "Better Homes and Gardens." I am sure you will enjoy hearing Mr. Hottes. I am pleased to introduce Mr. Alfred C. Hottes of "Better Homes and Gardens." </seg>
            <seg id="p462">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF 1 AGRICULTURE . SUl'KKLiATIVK DEGBEK PLANTS By Alfred C. Hottes. The gardener with a small garden must make a choice of the plants which he will grow. The apace is limited, but the desires of the true gardeners are for everything that is attractive. As the writer's mind roams over the realm of plants he thinks of certain ones, which to him, more nearly suit the purpose than any others. Each year, perhaps, he would think of a different list. The best small lawn tree is known as Bechtel's Flowering Crab. The flowers are pink and resemble roses. It is an upright tree and retains good foliage throughout the season. The best pyramidal tree for backgrounds is known as the Bolleana Poplar. This tree has grey leaves and is a little more plum shaped than the commoner- Lombardy Poplar. The best Privet for a hedge costs more than the California Privet, but is hardier. It is called the Ibolium Privet. It closely resembles the California Privet, because of its shiny leaves. The most effective shrub for foundation planting about the home is the Regel Privet. It is of horizontal growth, clean foliage, white flowers and black fruits. It fits the situation, bringing the house down to the soil in the proper way. The best low growing shrub for foundation planting is the Slender Deutzia, Deutzia gracllis. The graceful trusses of white flowers bloom in May and the small leaves are attractive all summer. The best early flowered shrub is the Showy Ooldenbells, Forsythias spectabllis. This must not be confused with the common Goldenbells for this one is much more profuse in flowering. The best tall hedge shrub is known as Rhamnus frangula. It is good because of its clean and glossy foliage; its fruits which are. pro - duced over a long period. They are green, then red, and change to black. The best tree for smoky tenement' sections of a city is the Oriental Plane, Platanus Orientate. The leaves stay fresh and green, in spite of the duskiness of the atmosphere. ' The most useful evergreen for home planting is known as Pfitzer Juniper. The fine foliage, the attractive informal habit and its city tolerating qualities, recommend it. The best evergreen for the shade is the Hemlock, fine foliage, good color and the fact that it can be kept low by pruning and allowed to grow tall and tree-like If desired, places it in a class by itself. </seg>
            <seg id="p463">■■■■w NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY The best evergreen climber (or the sun Is Euonymus vegeta. It bears orange fruits not unlike the Bittersweet. The leaves are clean and glossy. All are familiar with the English Ivy. It is the best vine for shaded places, but does not like the winter sun. The outstanding climber for tall porches and places where a very tall plant is needed is the Sllverlacevlne, Polygonum suberti. The large masses of pinkish white flowers are borne more profusely than of the Japanese Clematis and open earlier in the year. The best perennial for edging a garden is the Blue Fescue, Festuca glauca. It keeps Its place, never growing wider nor taller than is desirable for edging purposes. The best annual for edging is the widely known Sweet Alyssum. The white flowers are known to all. Its long season of bloom is an added good quality. The best annual for profusion of bloom for beds is the Petunia, never known to fall. It blooms from the day the plants are purchased until frost and drouth has ruined most other plants. The best perennial, that really blooms for a long time and gives a real foliage display, is the Funkia, the Plantainlily. There are many sorts, but all are good. Some, bear white flowers, others pink and some blue. Perhaps the best climbing rose is Dr. Van Fleet. Soft pink and with long stems and glossy foliage possibly nothing competes with it. Undoubtedly, Radiance is the most popular rose which is clear pink and produces a profusion of bloom. Its brother rose, Red Radi - ance, is the most successful red rose. In apite of what is said of the Red Radiance, Gruss and Teplitz produces more flowers, although they are not good for cutting. The best lawn grass for shaded places is the Rough Stalk Meadow Grass. It grows where other and cheaper grasses refuse to succeed. The best ground cover for the shade is Pachysandra. The leaves are evergreen and glossy. It does not become a weed. These then are one person's choice of the plants which are hard and useful in Columbus. Each garden of any size will require all of them. </seg>
            <seg id="p464">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE TUESDAY AFTERNOON SESSION JANUARY 7 — 1:30 P. M. PRESIDENT MARSHALL: Ladies and Gentlemen: The meeting will please come to order. If we are to get through on .schedule we will have to begin promptly. The first number on our program for this afternoon is by Mr. N. F. Guernsey, Landscape Architect, Sioux City, Iowa. The subject of this talk is "Planting the Small Lot" and it will be illustrated with lantern slides. Mr. Guernsey: "PLANTING THE SMALL LOT" By NEWELL P. GUERNSEY, Landscape Architect, Sioux City, Iowa. Edgar Guest has said: "It takes a heap o' living to make a house a home." Therefore whatever suggestions I may have toward mak - ing a reality of your dream home, — must be tempered by the fact that you, and you alone, can impress your life and personality upon your surroundings. Since our environment affects our happiness, it is of the utmost importance that we carefully plan our home and its surroundings before even a spadeful of earth is moved on the site. A first step in planning is the selection of a suitable lot. Too often, we plan our house without consideration of its relationship to the grounds. The coal window may* be just where we want a beauti - ful lawn. The living room windows may look out over the drive. The kitchen entrance may be so placed that deliverly boys will need to cross the whole back yard to . get to it, especially when one is having an afternoon tea party. We have all seen this kind of planning. How much better to plan both house and grounds in the begin - ning. The grounds of a small city lot are simply the continuation of rooms of the house. Indeed, back yard areas are no longer dump - ing grounds — but rapidly changing into "outdoor living rooms." Suppose that you are planning your new home. You want it to be the "dream home" you have always .longed for. You want to enjoy the full use of your grounds, — at the smallest possible cost. The question is, where to begin? I would suggest that you keep these three main divisions of space clearly in mind. Much of the success of your planning depends upon how well you can handle them, — keeping each one separate from the other. First, your .semi-public area. In this, let us include your front lawn which is usually open to public view. You want this lawn </seg>
            <seg id="p465">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY to be beautifully planted, so that passers-by will get a fine impression of your home. Avoid "cluttering-up" this front lawn. Plantings should be well to the sides, with a great sweep of "open lawn" to - ward the center. Planting against the front foundation should be restrained, with at least some of the foundation showing. Too often we see plantings that appear "choked." We feel that they are over - done. It is better to think of this front lawn planting as simply forming a "frame" or "setting" for the real picture, which must necessarily be the house itself. Unless your grounds are large, there can be little privacy secured in your front lawn, — since its real purpose must be the effect enjoyed by passers-by. For real privacy, we must follow the old English cus - tom of planning lawn and garden to the rear. How much different Rock gardens and pools are interesting features for the "Outdoor Living vRooni " Here is a combination of these two as developed on the Velie estate near Minneapolis. than the back yards of our childhood days, — when ashes, clothes lines, tin cans and alleys seemed to find their way into this part of the ground, which was used for little else. This brings us to our second main division of use, — that part of the yard which is to be the family "outdoor living room." 'Naturally its first requirement must be "privacy." In this day of strenuous activity in business and social life, we need some spot where we can find calm and repose. We have these within our own home. But how refreshing it is, to sit under the sky, and waving greenery of trees, out in the open, where we can also be secluded from the neighbors' view. ' ■ Privacy is rather easy to secure.

Then the lawn inside can be decorated and furnished, just like the living room of your house. You must be the one to determine the kinds of plants to use, — for this boundary planting, — that is, if you are planning the yard yourself. You must decide between a fence or hedge, or informal boundary planting. Of these, a fence, if at all artistic, will probably cost the most. Furthermore, it will need plantings of shrubbery to go with it. Most hedges, as a rule, do not grow tall enough for many years, to form a real protection from neighbors' views. I think you will get the most for your money, by planning an informal boundary planting, composed of several kinds of trees and shrubs. In this way, you can plant the tallest ones, in front of the neighbors' garage A large natural sarden with weeping willows at the water's edge. and places where you need the highest screen. For these tall plant - ings use Tartarian Honeysuckle, a fast, dependable grower; old-fash - ioned Lilacs, Mock Orange, Russian Olive, Buckthorn, and other tall shrubs; and do not hesitate to include certain kinds of trees among these shrubs. Bolles Poplar, or Volga Poplar, grow tall, but occupy very little width on ground. European Mountain Ash grows well among shrubs, and will attract many birds with its red berries. Several kinds of Wild Cherry may be used; and innumerable others, which all grow high, and mix well in shrub borders. Another advantage in using the informal shrub planting, is the all-season bloom that you get by using different kinds of shrubs. Be - fore planning this border, however, you should spend considerable time in studying your plants. I would advise you not to depend too much upon nursery catalogues, but rather to study some of. the under- </seg>

For furnishings, your outdoor living room may have comfortable seats, canopies overhead, tables where you can serve outdoor meals, equipment for children's plan.

SWENK, Entomologist, Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station* At the meeting of the Nebraska State Horticultural Society a year ago, the writer presented a .paper on "Codling Moth Investiga - tions in Nebraska", which outlined the codling moth problem in this state and summarized the results of the life-history studies on that pest that had been conducted in 1928.

            <seg id="p470">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE on pages 31 to 49 of the 1929 report of the Society. The present paper is a report on the continuation of this study for 1929. As in 1928, the principal life-history work was carried on at Lincoln in an open-air insectary located in the Agricultural College orchard. Dally counts and observations were made on the time and duration of the different broods of eggs, larvae, pupae and moths. A bait trap was maintained in the orchard near by, to secure data on the flight of moths each night, and for comparative purposes a similar bait trap was maintained in Shubert Brothers orchard at Shubert, Nebraska. Relation of Weather to Codling Moth Injury As the writer stated last year, we probably normally have each year in southeastern Nebraska three generations of the codling moth, the third one being quite variable as to strength. Certainly we had three generations in 1928; and the same is just as true for 1929, during which season the third brood was even better marked than in 1928. Now that we have assembled complete data for two seasons, we may look for some general correlations between the weather con - ditions in 1928 and 1929 and codling moth life-history, which is one of the primary objects of these investigations. Shelf ord 1 has recently stated that the direct use of weather data in analyzing the develop - ment of the codling moth has proved to be largely a failure; that is probably correct so far as highly accurate results are concerned, but the writer is as yet not at all convinced but that weather data may be of much direct value to the practical horticulturist, who probably would not make use of highly complicated "developmental units" and "velocity curves" anyway. It is generally conceded that differences In weather conditions from one year to another are largely the cause of the seasonal variation in the degree of injury by the. codling moth. Weather in relation to the codling moth is comprised of a number of variable elements — temperature, humidity, rainfall, evaporation, light intensity, air-movement, and others. All of these undoubtedly play a greater or less part. Codling moth larvae of the first brood may enter dormancy in late July or August, but this is mostly done by larvae of the second and third broods in September. It used to be thought that dormancy in the codling moth larva was induced by exposure to a temperature of 51.8°P. or thereabout. But in recent experimental work reported by Shelford (1927), a number of codling moth larvae were subjected to temperatures of 39.2°F. to 51°F. All larvae that had not been subjected "to a temperature as low as 51.8°F. out of doors were artificially subjected to temperatures below 50 9 F. Of these larvae, July larvae gave 17% falling to pupate because of dormancy, early August larvae 38%, and middle August larvae 89%, thus Indicating a seasonal increase in failure to pupate, regardless of temperature. This finding does not,, however, mean that tempera - 'Bulletln of the Illinois Natural History Survey; xvl. p. 333 (1927). </seg>
            <seg id="p471">Nebraska state horticultural society ture has no direct influence whatever, on codling moth larvae entering into dormancy. It simply shows that there is an increasing seasonal tendency toward dormancy during the summer and fall, irrespective of temperature. Headlee' has shown that when the average weekly mini - mum temperature approaches 60°F., codling moth transformation of larvae to pupae ceases and the untransformed larvae winter as such. The amount of rainfall during the autumn and winter certainly has a great deal to do with the survival of the hibernating larvae and the heaviness and rapidity of development of the spring brood of pupae and moths; much more than do the winter temperatures. When the autumn months — September to November, inclusive — have plenty of rainfall, more of the hibernating larvae survive, regardless of suc - ceeding low temperatures, more of them pupate and the pupal stage is shorter than when the preceding fall has been relatively dry. As a result there is an increased abundance of codling moths of the spring brood following a. wet fall. Townsend (1926) 2 showed that dormancy of the codling moth larvae is broken up by the reabsorption of water by their tissues. It is believed that the adding of water "to the body speeds up enzyme action. Some essential physiological process in dormant codling moth larvae that goes on well only at low temperatures (Townsend) is slow at 32 "F., proceeds most rapidly at 50° P. but becomes slower again above 50°P. This process is favored by a high water content. An enzyme, or a pH affecting an enzyme, would show such characteristics. Delayed emergence may be due to failure to take in sufficient water or develop sufficient enzymes, or a proper pH concentration. Soaking the larvae increases the per cent of larval pupation, shortens the period to pupation, and shortens the pupal period. Pupation of the winter - ing larvae is hastened by rains, regardless of temperature. For the flight and egglaying of the moths a temperature of 62°F. after sunset is necessary.' If there are plenty of such evenings dur - ing the period of flight of the spring brood of moths there is likely to be a maximum activity of the moths and a correspondingly heavy egg-laying. A series of warm evenings in late April and May tre - mendously predisposes to a heavy first brood of larvae, and the seri - ousness of the codling moth problem in any year seems to be distinctly related to the size of the first brood of larvae. Temperature is by far the most important weather factor in influencing the rate of hatch - ing of the eggs and the development of the larvae and pupae. Glenn* has showi: that development begins as soon as the maximum daily temperature rises above 50°F. for the egg and larva, and above 52°F. for the pupa, and that the rate of development Increases as the tem - perature rises until the degree of maximum rate of development is 'Journal of the New York Entomological Society, xxxvl. p. 162 (1928) 'Annals of the Entomological Society of America, xix. pp. 429-489. &lt;Iae]y and Ackerman, Bulletin 189.

Temperatures for several degrees above these degrees of maximum rate of development retard development at about the same rate as temperatures below them retard it. Thus, a pupa with the maximum rate of development at 87°F. is- retarded about equally at temperatures of 84°F. and 90°F. Humidity seems to directly influence chiefly the egg and pupa, as the larva is surrounded by a juicy pulp of the apple. - But rain - fall, humidity and the amount of light will influence food quality, and may thus indirectly influence larval development in the apple. It is well known that the development of codling moth' larvae is influenced by the variety of apple concerned. Comparisons of 1028 and 1020 The total precipitation for the eight months, September, 1927, to April, 1928, inclusive, was only 6.39 inches. For the corresponding eight months in 1928-29 it was over twice as much, . totaling 13.80 inches. The normal precipitation for this period is 11.37 inches. We may, therefore, term the winter of 1927-28 "dry" and that of 1928-29 "wet". The total precipitation for the first five months of 1929 was 7.96 inches, which was 1.51 inches below the normal, and for the first five months of 1928 was 5.37 inches, which was 4.10 inches below the normal. The precipitation for the crucial month of April was 2.93 inches in 1929 against 1.18 inches in 1928. The mean tempera - ture during March was very much the same in both 1928 and 1929 (43.4°F. and 42.G"F., respectively), but for April it was considerably higher in 1929 than in 1928 (54.2°., or 2.7° above normal — 51.5°F. — for 1929, as against 48.2°F., or 3.3° below the normal, for 1928). The mean per cent of relative humidity at noon was distinctly and consistently higher in 1929 than in 1928, for the first five months of the year; 1929 being nearly normal and 1928 distinctly subnormal (average normal 58%; 1929, 57.2%; 1928, 45%). Since a "wet" winter favors the survival, early pupation and rapid development of the wintering codling moth larvae, and since their pupation and the early emergence of the spring brood of moths Is favorably influenced by higher spring temperatures and by greater spring rainfall, in view of the weather data given above, one would expect to find an earlier pupation and emergence of the spring brood in 1929 than in 1928, and our emergence data fully bears out this expectation. The first wintering larva pupated on April 26 in 1929, but not until May 8 in 1928, and the first moth of the spring brood was observed on May 19 in 1929 but not until May 23 in 1928. The month of May in 1928 had a mean temperature of 64.6°F., or 2.9° above the normal (61.7°F. ), while in 1929 it had a mean tempera - ture of only 60°F., or 1.7° below the normal.

Spring brood pupation was at its crest on May 23 in 1929 and on May 24 in 1928. The height of flight of the spring brood of moths was June 9 in 1929 and June 8 in 1928, and the close of the spring brood flight was July 11 in 1928 and July 7 in 1929. The fact that records of the pupation of 188 wintering larvae were made In 1929 as compared to only 132 in 1928, probably accounts for the fact that the last pupa under observation did not transform until June 27 in 1929, whereas in 1928 the last pupation was 5 days earlier, or on June 22. ■The development of the first brood of the codling moth was extremely similar in 1928 and 1929. First brood eggs were found on June 13 in 1929 and on June 15 in 1928. The crest of egg-laying was reached on June 25 in 1929 and on June 22 in 1928. The last first-brood egg hatched on' July 12 in 1929 and- on July 19 in 1928. These dates run very close, but late June and July in 1928 and 1929 presented very similar meteorological conditions. The average mean temperature for July was 77°F. in 1928 and 77.4°F. in 1929; rain - fall was 5.72 Inches in 1928 and 5.32 Inches in 1929; relative humid - ity at noon was 51% In 1928 and 52% in 1929.

In August and September of 1928 and 1929 temperature condi - tions were again very similar, the mean for August in 1928 being 76.2°F., and for 1929 being 76.7°F., while the mean for September was 64.6°F. in both years. ' Much greater rainfall in August, 1928 (3.65 inches) than in 1929 (.92 inches), however, resulted in an in - creased relative humidity in 1928 (52% at noon) as compared to 1929 (45% at noon). This relatively greater dryness during August in 1929 influenced the development of the larvae and pupae of the second brood of the codling moth more favorably, as compared with 1928. Second-brood eggs were first noted on July 16 in 1929 as com - pared with July 21 in 19.28, reached the crest on July 18 as compared with August 2, and ended on September 6 as compared to September 10.

Second brood pupae in 1929 occurred from August 15 to September 24, with the crest on August 20, and in 1928 from August 14 to September 30, with the crest on .September 10. Thus it is seen that the emergence of the second-brood pupae was considerably retarded in 1928 as compared with 1929. The first second-brood moths appeared in 1929 on August 25, in 1928 on September 9. The crest of second-brood moths came in 1929 on August 30 and in 1928 on September 19. The last second - brood moths occurred in 1929 on October 16, in 1928 on October 10. The two weeks' earlier flight of the moths of the second brood in 1929, as compared with 1928 (beginning August 25, 1929 and September 9, 1928), set forward the development of eggs and larvae of the third or wintering brood in 1929 an equivalent amount. The first eggs of the third brood were found on September 1 in 1929 and on September 18 in 1928. The last eggs of this brood were found on October 1 in 1929 and on October 15 in 1928. The first larvae of the third brood were found on September 13 in 1929 and on Sep - tember 25 in 1928. In both seasons the entire period of third brood eggs was about one month (31 days in 1929, 32 days in 1928), re - flecting the closely parallel conditions of September mean temperature (6 4. 6 "P. in both years) and rainfall (2.01 incheB in 1928, 1.82 inches in 1929). The Record for 1020 One hundred and sixty-four wintering larvae were collected from under bands in the Agricultural College orchard at Lincoln on April 26 (38), May 4 (50) and May 11 (76), while on April 30, at Shu - bert Brothers' orchard at Shubert, 135 wintering larvae were col - lected. Of these 299 wintering larvae, there survived to pupation from each lot 27, 35, 60 and 66 larvae, respectively, making a total of 188 larvae that survived. As in 1928, these larvae were placed in cocooning racks, which were kept in glass jars in the out-of-doors insectary in the Agricultural College orchard, under temperature con - ditions similar to those in the orchard itself. One pupa was found in the orchard on April 26, along with the 38 larvae collected oh that date. The first pupation in the insectary occurred on May 3 (five days earlier than in 1928) and the second pupation occurred on .May 7. Other larvae pupated on each day from May 12 to June 2. The high point of pupation was May 23 (one day earlier than in 1928), on which day twenty-two larvae pupated. On May 24, 113 larvae, or 50.1 per cent of the whole, had pupated, as compared to 89.4 per cent on the same day in. 1928. The last of the 188 larvae pupated on June 11. The pupation period covered 39 days as com - pared with 28 days in 1928. The last pupa gave up its moth on June 27.

Eighty-five of these were male moths and 93 were female moths. The length of life of the moths, considering both sexes to - gether, varied from 1 day to 23 days. As usual, the female moths showed greater longevity, as a group, than the male moths, though this year it was but slight. The average length of life of the male moths was 9.25 days, of the female moths 9.88 days and of all moths 0.58 days. This was decidedly a shorter term of life than the moths of the spring brood had in 1928. The last moth of the spring brood died July 7.

The first date of oviposition was June 13. and the last date of ovlpositlon was July 4. A total of 569 eggs were deposited. The average number of days before oviposition was 8.2, the number varying from 4 to 13 days. The average number of days of oviposition was 7.7, the minimum being 0 and the maximum 16 days. The average number of days from date of emergence to last oviposition was 13.8, the minimum being 9 and the maximum 20 days. Of these 569 eggs deposited between June 13 and July 4, 217 were laid on leaves, and an effort was made to rear these. However, only 63 were fertile. Of these 48 were followed through to hatching. These 48 eggs were deposited between June 13 and July 4 and hatched between June 21 and July 12. Egg-laying was at. its height on June 24 to 26, with a strong second wave on July 1 and 2. The incubation period of these 48 eggs varied from 7 to 9 days, with an average of 7.58 days. Adding this period to the date of first observed oviposi - tion, June 13, the first larvae of the first brood must have hatched about June 21, making that the correct date for starting the applica - tion of the first cover spray in 1929.

Of these, 69 were male moths and 55 were female moths. The length of life of these moths varied from 1 (female) moth that died the same day that it' emerged to a (female) moth that lived for 20 days. The average length of life of the male moths was 7.89 days, of the female moths 7.67 days, and of all moths 7.79 days. The moths of the first brood in 1929 as a whole lived less than two days less than those of the spring brood of 1929, while in 1928 the moths of the first brood as a whole lived about 4 days less than those of the spring brood. This is no doubt due to the higher June temperatures in 1929, shortening the average life of the spring brood of moths of 1929 as compared to those of 1928. July and August temperatures in the two seasons were practically the same. The total period of flight of the moths of the first brood extended from July 13 to September 23, a period of 9 weeks, as contrasted to a 7 weeks' period of flight of the spring brood of moths.

These observations are shown in detail in table number 12: Of the 1,366 eggs deposited between July 16 and September 1, 793 were laid upon leaves and an effort was made to hatch them. However, only 397 were actually carried through to hatching. The average incubation period was 5.81 days (compared with 5.98 days in 1928); less than 2 days shorter than the average incubation period of the eggs of the first brood. Since the first ovlposltlon was observed on July 16, and the average incubation period was about 6 days, we should look for the hatching of the first larvae of the second brood about July 22, the date that the first larvae hatched from the eggs under observation. The 397 eggs hatched between July 22 and Sep - tember 6. Egg laying was at its height on July 18, 19 and 20, fully 2 weeks earlier than the height of egg laying in 1928.

            <seg id="p491">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY THE 1920 SPRAY EXPERIMENTS AT SHUBERT By W. W. YOCUM, Lincoln, Nebraska Many of you know that the Department of Horticulture has been conducting spray experiments for codling moth control for several years. About 1925 the codling moth was causing ' serious damage to the apples, and the fruit growers asked for help. This experimental spraying has been conducted since that time to improve our spraying methods, and it will doubtless continue several years longer. One of the chief things which we have learned during this time is that the development of the codling moth varies considerably from year to year, and we must vary the time of spraying as the codling moth varios in its development. We are more thoroughly convinced each year as to the value of using traps and cages in each orchard to study the moths. They are the most reliable means of determining when a spray is needed for codling moth. Our experimental spraying the past two years has been chiefly a test of the value of summer oils. These oils are being widely ad - vertised and many growers are anxious to know what merit they possess. The growing season of 1929 was quite similar to that of 1928 in many respects. The cold damp weather during the blooming season resulted in a light crop of apples in most orchards. The codling moth developed slowly and in small numbers. Professor Swenk has shown you that the codling moth developed in 1929 much as it did in 1928. As a result of these conditions we had little difficulty in controlling codling moth last year. You may remember that in 1928 we got very good control of the worms in all our experimental spraying, also. ' The number of worms in each test were so small that we could not say definitely that one method of spraying was better than another. For that reason we con - tinued much the same experiment in 1929 as we did in 1928, and still we are not able to draw any satisfactory conclusions from these tests as to the value of oil. We thought that in 1928 we had about as clean a crop of apples as one could expect, but in 1929 the crop was even cleaner. In the young orchards none of the plats showed as much as 1% worms and the stings were less than 5% in all cases. In the old Jonathan orchard we got only about hall) as much Injury as in 1928. The wormy fruit ranged from 2 to 11.3% and stings from 6 to 14%. This is quite different from conditions In 1927 when the per cent of worms ran as high as 56% in our spray plats. So again this year, as last, we feel that any conclusions which we might attempt to draw would be rather far fetched, since the control was so complete In all cases. '•".•■ </seg>
            <seg id="p492">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE While I am not able to give you any information from our tests of summer oils, I can give you some things which the Western growers have found out about these oil sprays. Last year the fruit growers of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Mon - tana, and British Columbia met in a joint conference and came to the following unanimous decisions with regard to the use of summer oil sprays: (1) Never make over three applications or it will reduce the size of the fruit. (2) Oil alone gives no control of codling moth. ( 3 ) Never use oil with lime-sulphur. (4) Never use oil with lead-arsenate after the first week in July, else you will have difficulty removing the residue. (5) Nicotine sulfate may be used with oil late in the season and is quite effective in controlling codling moth. ( 6 ) Never let the mixture of oil and lead arsenate stand in the pipes or tank, for then the residue is very much harder to remove. Codling Moth Bands You will probably be interested in another phase of codling moth control which we have been testing lately. This has to do with the use of bands. Of course bands have been used for a long time in codling moth control. But in recent years paper bands nave been used, treated with chemicals, for the purpose of killing the worms when they crawl under the bands to hide and pupate. The manu - facturers claim that such bands have been effective in some sections, so we have been testing them here. Last year two kinds of paper bands were sent us but neither seemed at all effective in killing the worms which harbored under them. The worms collected under the. dark paper bands in larger numbers than under burlap bands, perhaps because it is darker there. The past summer, paper bands were again sent us. These were of corrugated paper, much like packing boxes are made of, and were about two inches wide. These were treated with seven different chemical formulae. We were asked to test these to see which treat - ment gave the most promise. This test gave some interesting results. The bands were removed last week. and the following data obtained: ■ Treatment Live worms Dead worms % killed A 7 • 195 96. 5 5 72 35 33 6 123 43 26 7 • 206 . 70 25 8 293 52 ' 15 9 . 142 54 27.5 Under burlap on same trees 168 13 7.2 </seg>
            <seg id="p493">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Bands treated with chemical formula A served as a harbor for 202 worms and of these 195 were dead. The dried condition of the worms showed that most- of them had been dead for a long while. This treatment seems to be quickly effective. The bands treated with the other chemicals gave a kill of from 15 to 33% of the worms harboring under them. The dead worms under these bands were still plump and soft in most cases, indicating a slower kill. Of 181 worms caught under burlap bands on the same tree 9.2% were dead. The birds began pecking into these paper bands early in the winter, looking for the hidden worms. For that reason we had to remove the bands last week in order to learn the effect of the treat - ment. You have heard of drinking up the evidence, well, In this case the birds seemed determined to eat up the evidence. We are not ready to recommend the use of chemically treated bands, but it does seem that if they will give a 95% kill of worms they will certainly be worth using. Spray Residue We gathered some information on the arsenical spray residue situation in southeast Nebraska again this year. We wished to know if this arsenical residue which was left on the fruit as a result of our spraying was . approaching the danger point. Remember that the legal limit for interstate commerce is ultimately to be .01 grain of arsenic per pound of fruit. Samples of apples were taken at harvest time from each of our spray plats at Shubert and analyzed for arsenic. These apples were gathered from various parts of two trees in each plat. They were then brought to our chemists here at the college. The chemists first weighed the apples, then peeled them, and from the peelings determined the amount of arsenic left by the spraying. Here are the results from the old Jonathan orchard: Only two samples ran over half the amount which Is allowed. The average is .0041 grain per pound of fruit. In the young orchard the residue ran still lower. The average here was but .002 grain and but one sample ran over half the maximum which the law tolerates. These results seem to indicate that we had little cause for worry from arsenical residue In Nebraska this year. In some of our experi - mental spraying Ve used heavier dosages of lead and made more and heavier applications than did most of the growers. We used oils once or twice on 13 of our spray plats, also, and all authorities agree that oils hold the lead arsenate on the fruit. However, we were favored with plenty of rain in eastern Nebraska during this past summer to wash off part of th«s residue. The Department of Horticulture purchased a fruit washer last summer and set it up at the University Fruit Farm at Union. This washer was obtained so that we can secure some first hand informa- </seg>

We will determine the value of the machine In cleaning the fruit, and see what effect the washing process has upon the keeping quality of the fruit. This machine was not purchased because we think all apples should be washed or that we will be forced to wash our fruit soon. But If any emergency does arise you will look to this department for help, and we want to be able to give you real help. - Arsenical Spray Residue Analyses Old Orchard — Jonathans: Sample AsiO&gt; in Grains Sample AbjOi in Grains No. per pound No. per pound 1 .0023 6 .0054 2_, .0027 6 .0022 3 .0062 ' 7 .0015 4: .0062 8 .0016 5 .0032 Young Orchard — Wlnesaps: 6 .0044 1 .0014 7 .0032 2 .0015 8 : .0046 3— .0021 Young Orchard — Missouri Pippins: 4 0014 1_ .0029 5 .0024 2 .0018 6 ; .0015 3 .0025 7 .0019 4 .

I am sure that all fruit growers are Interested in this matter because without pollination there can be no paying fruit crop. Last season was a year when everything looked favorable for bumper fruit crops, the trees were vigorous, there were lots of fruit buds and flowers, there were no killing frosts and yet the fruit crops were unusually light. I don't know whether there is much we can do* about it, but at any rate we will learn what Dr. Murneek has found out at Missouri regarding this matter. It gives me great pleasure in introducing to you Dr. A. E. Murneek of the University of Missouri. DR. A. E. MURNEEK: Mr. President, ladles and gentlemen: I don't see why you come to Missouri for someone to discuss fruit prob - lems with you. You have here men like Dr. Wiggins, Professor Yocum and Propessor Hoppert who could tell you as much as I can about these matters. In fact Professor Yocum, when he was taking his work at Missouri University, did most of the work on the pollination studies that I am reporting to you today. I suppose, though, that someone from away from home, someone whom you don't know is a better drawing card than one of your own number. Be that as it may </seg>
            <seg id="p495">NEBRASKA STATE HOETICULTURAL SOCIETY I am glad to be with you today and tell you all I know about these various fruit problems. Don't get the notion that we know every - thing connected with these topics because that is not the case. There are many things to learn yet and we are spending lots of money at Missouri to learn more about them. THE POLLINATION OF TREE FRUITS By DR. A. E. MURNEEK, University of Missouri. In order to secure a good crop of fruits it is necessary that the flowers, which eventually develop into fruits, be properly pollinated and fertilized. Pollination is the transfer of the pollen grains, the male elements of the flower, to the moist surface of the stigma, the female organ of the flower. There the pollen germinates, extending a long tube into the central part of the flower, where the act of fer - tilization takes place. Flowers which are not pollinated and fertilized will drop soon after blossoming or else will develop into fruits which fall off while still small. Pollination is accomplished by insects, usually the common honey bee. If during the time of flowering, bees are not present in any quantity in the orchard, then the set of fruit will be small. Likewise when the flight of bees is interfered with by low temperature or rainy weather, then most of the flowers will remain unpollinated and as a consequence will not develop into fruits. Hence, in order to assure as much as possible the proper . transfer of pollen from flower to flower, bees must be provided at blossoming time. No effective polli - nation can be obtained when bees are absent, since other insects usually are of minor consequence in this respect If bees are not found in the immediate neighborhood, the commercial fruit grower should secure a number of good colonies for his orchard. Usually one hive per acre will be sufficient, excepting where the trees are very large and in full bearing, when more may be necessary. This Is especially true in years when weather conditions are very unfavorable during blossoming and, therefore, the posible period of pollination is reduced to a minimum. Inmost localities bees may be rented for the flowering season at two to five dollars per colony. This is indeed n small expenditure for the results that may be expected from this practice. In many instances improper pollination is not the only reason for a poor yield of fruit. The weather may be ideal for insect flight, still the set of apples may be very sparse or the trees may be totally barren. How is this to be explained in all such cases where killing frosts have not been a factor and otherwise the orchard has received good care? </seg>
            <seg id="p496">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Extensive investigations at the Missouri and other Agricultural Experiment Stations have shown that most commercial varieties of apples are self-sterile or else are greatly benefited by cross-pollination. They will not Bet many fruit when pollinated by their own pollen, but will do so much more readily when the pollen comes from a tree of another variety. Hence, a proper set of apples may be expected only when bees have a chance to visit . flowers of several varieties. Since practically all of our common varieties of apples are either self-sterile or are markedly benefited by cross-pollination, therefore in establishing a new orchard it is highly desirable that at least two, but still better three, varieties be planted together. For best results every third row should be of the pollinating sort, though planting every fourth or even sixth row for this purpose has frequently given satisfactory results. Under Missouri conditions the following varieties of apples, in order of their preference, have been found to be the best producers of good viable pollen: Delicious, Jonathan, Ben Davis, Golden Delicious, and Grimes. They will not only pollinate each other effectively, but can be also safely interplanted with practically any variety for this purpose. On the other hand, the members of the Winesap group — Winesap, Stayman, Arkansas, and Arkansas Black — produce poor pollen and, therefore, need to be planted together with other varieties. Because of this defect they normally will not cross-pollinate each' other and may be considered more or less inter - sterile. In cases where an orchard has been planted to one variety and pollination has become decidedly a limited factor to proper yields of fruit, the grower can resort to two things. He may top gaft every fourth or sixth row with a 'pollenizer, say Delicious or Jonathan, or, to lessen the work and secure relief to some extent, at least every third tree in every third row should be top worked. As a temporary expedient and while the grafted trees attain the age of full flowering, branches of a good pollen producing variety may be set in the orchard at flowering time. They should be cut just before the blossom buds begin to open and placed in palls or barrels containing plenty of water. Bees will visit the flowers on these branches and thus assure to a considerable degree interpollination. It must be emphasized that, in order to make this type of pollination extensive and effective, there must be present in the orchard an ample number of these large "bouquets" of flowering branches and they must not be permitted to dry oat. Since all commercial varieties of peaches, excepting the J. H. Hale variety, apparently are self-sterile, they can be planted in solid blocks. Unless it will be shown more definitely that cross-pollination increases appreciably the size of the fruit, interplantlng of peaches for pollina - tion purposes is not necessary but may be desirable for other reasons, such as adaptation of certain sorts to varying soil conditions, the extension of the harvesting and marketing season, etc. </seg>
            <seg id="p497">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Sour cherries, though normally producing good crops when self - pollihated, may be benefited in some years at least, by cross-pollina - tion. Thus Early Richmond and Montmorency, our two leading varie - ties, will crop better through a series of years when interplanted and sometimes when supplied with other sour cherries as pollenizers. It should be noted, however, that the exact pollination requirements of the sour cherries have not yet been established. The Dukes, May Duke and Royal Duke, are self-sterile. They must be interplanted with sour cherries to insure fertilization of the flowers. Even when proper pollination takes place, trees, though bloom - ing profusely; sometimes will not produce fruit. Under such condi - tions the use of ■ a nitrogenous fertilizer will frequently remedy the situation. Either nitrate of soda or ammonium sulphate, applied 10 to 20 days before flowering may increase the set most remarkably. While young trees usually do not suffer from lack of nitrogen, those in full bearing may be highly benefited by this treatment. In fact, many cases are known where abnormally . small crops of fruit were not due to improper pollination, but to a general weakness of the trees — usually a shortage of nitrogen. In all such instances manuring with a nitrogenous fertilizer will produce a quick relief. When pruning has been neglected, trees often bloom heavily but set little fruit. A thorough thinning out of the most crowded parts or such trees will revitalize the remaining branches. This leads to ht-Uer vegetative growth, formation of new spurs, fewer but more vigorous fruit buds, and larger leaves. As a consequence there will be a marked increase in fruit production; and, what is more import - tint, the fruit will be of larger size and of better color. The general procedure in an orchard that blooms heavily but does not set fruit would be as follows: First see to it that spraying, pruning, and other orchard practices are executed properly. Then apply a readily available nitrogenous fertilizer about two weeks be - fore the flowers open. If the trees still refuse to bear, then it is quite evident that a pollination trouble exists. When bees or other insects are not present in large enough numbers at the time of blossoming, a few hives should be obtained for this purpose. If no relief 1b secured then it is rather certain that a real pollination trouble exists and proper pollenizers should be provided in order to assure a maximum yield of fruits. ■■.■..'. Questipn: Are insects absolutely necessary for the pollination of the apple? Answer: Yes, they are indispensable. Question : Don't you think that bees injure grape ' flowers and fruits? </seg>
            <seg id="p498">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Answer: They do not as a rule. Bees frequently feed on grapes that have been injured in some other way, but they cannot pierce the skin of a grape. Question: Can an apple develop without the presence' of seeds? Answer: Aa a rule no commercial variety of apples will come to maturity without the presence of seeds. Sometimes, however, the seeds are injured late in their growth, become shriveled, and then it appears as if they were not present, but at the time of setting there were plump healthy seeds in the young apple. Question : Will pruning increase the set of fruit? ' Answer: It will, especially when the tree is devitalized, by in - creasing the vigor of the remaining branches. THE PRESIDENT: Are there any other questions which any of you would like to ask Dr. Murneek regarding this subject? MR. C. A. LORD: Does the same thing apply to pear trees? I have several pear trees that haven't produced as well as they should. DR. MURNEEK: In general the same thing holds with regard to pears that I mentioned regarding the apple, namely that most varie - ties are self-sterile. In California that is not the case with some of these varieties. But here with Kiefter, Duchess, Lispel, Bartlett, etc., it is desirable, yes, in fact, necessary that you have several varie - ties planted together. PRESIDENT MARSHALL: The time Is getting late and I believe we had better change the order of things at this point. There will hardly be time to do justice to Mr. Abildguard's subject in the few minutes remaining. Therefore we will bear from him at about 2:30 this afternoon. We have just about enough time to hold our business meeting this morning. " . • . . All of you who are not members of the Society will be given a chance to escape at this time.

            <seg id="p500">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE WEDNESDAY MORNING SESSION JANUARY 8, 1930 THE PRESIDENT: First, we will have the report of the Secretary. REPORT OP THE SECRETARY E. H. HOPPERT Activities ot the Nebraska Horticultural Society Winter meetings of the Society were held in Lincoln at the time of Organized Agriculture, January 8-10. The purpose of these meet - ings is to bring to those interested in horticulture the latest informa - tion on various phases of the industry. The meetings started off with a session on vegetable growing. Then followed two sessions on fruit growing topics and finally one session on landscape gardening. The out-of-state speakers who appeared were Prof. J. T. Quinn of Columbia, Mo., who spoke on "The Modern Trend in Vegetable Production." Prof. R. H. Roberts of Madison, Wis., gave us two interesting talks on pruning fruit trees. E. A. Marshall of Kalamazoo, Mich., gave an illustrated lecture on "Beautifying the Home Grounds." The at - tendance was very good except for the session on "Vegetable Growing" which for some reason or other failed to attract a crowd. State Fair and Ak-Sar-Ben Exhibits In cooperation with the State Fair Board the Society sponsored the fruit, flower and nursery exhibit at the State Fair. In spite of a rather light crop of fruit in the commercial section a fine display of fruit was put up, the special feature of which was a mammoth apple. The amateur flower exhibits were not quite as numerous nor of as good quality as usual. The hot dry weather just preceding the State Fair was to blame. The .exhibit of the Nebraska Nurserymen's Asso - ciation attracted much favorable comment and it certainly added to the attractiveness of the building. The Society also sponsored an apple exhibit at the Ak-Sar-Ben stock show at Omaha, November 1-9. The- central feature of .this exhibit was an Indian tepee built of apples. An exhibit of trays of the commercial varieties was shown by four commercial growers from Otoe, Nemaha and Richardson counties. Exhibits of this type are valuable because they acquaint the public with the fact that Nebraska produces fine apples and many visitors inquired* about where these apples could be gotten. We hope that as soon as production is on a large scale an effort will be made by the growers to supply the demand created by exhibits of this type. </seg>

            <seg id="p502">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Legislative Activities Through the help of the legislative committee of the Society, (G. A. Marshall, Geo. Christy, W. B. Banning, Grove Porter and E. H. Hoppert) the needs of the commercial orchardlsts for protec - tion against cedar rust was explained to members of the House. This was deemed advisable because the House refused to concur in the bill presented by Senator Banning and passed by the Senate. ' The bill was brought back and amended slightly and passed and became a law. As it reads now cedar trees within 2 miles of commercial apple orchards' of 1,000 trees or more can be declared a nuisance and removed. The owner of the cedar trees may present this case to a board of arbitration and receive damages to be determined by a committee. These damages are to be paid by taxing orchard owners 50 cents per acre for young trees and $1.60 per acre for bearing orchards. National Horticultural Council At the last meeting it was voted to Join the National Horticul - tural Council as a body in order to help further the interests of fruit and vegetable growers in this country. It is felt that a tariff on bananas would help the fruit f rowers In that bananas are sold as fruit and compete with! fruit grown in this, country* The National Horticultural Council compiled some information about bananas and sent thiB to all of its members. It showed that more cars of bananas are shipped Into this country than cars of apples that enter into commerce. A lot of other facts were presented that will appear In the report but they ; will be omitted here on account of lack of time. This information was sent to our representatives at Washington with a letter asking their support for suitable tariff legislation. I will also include for publication the accomplishments along thla line to date. Other Activities The Society through its Executive Board authorized trips to the Central Western Shippers advisory board meeting at Kearney, to the Missouri Horticultural Society Field Day at Waverly, Mo., on August 1st, to the Missouri River Horticultural Conference December 4-Gth. Reports of what took place at these meetings are given in the August and December issues of the "Midwest Pruitman". In addition the Secretary was authorized to visit southern Illinois to study the Oriental Fruit Moth situation. A report of this trip will be given this after - noon. ■ • ft.

Secretary The Council was incorporated October 31. 1928. The first efforts were directed toward membership. The officers and directors used every opportunity offered to explain the organization . at| meetings during the winter. Our membership to date consists of practically all the state horticultural societies, a considerable number of co - operatives, and individual growers in a large number of states. When announcement of the tariff hearings of Congress was re - ceived, preparations were immediately started to present a case for the fruit, and vegetable industries. Two appearances were! made be - fore the Ways and Means .Committee of the House, in regard to the dutiable list and in regard to the free list. Increased duties were asked on a large number of vegetables and fruits now carrying duty. A request was made that bananas be transferred from the free list to the dutiable list. We asked that ammonium Rulphate. ammonium nitrate, calcium nitrate and urea be transferred to the free! list along with other fertilizers. We asked that crude horseradish ! be trans - ferred from the free list to the dutiable list, and that chickpeas, a competitor of peas and beans, be made dutiable. The Ways and Means Committee and the House granted some very good increases in rates on many vegetables and on some fruits They transferred- two of the nitrogenous fertilizers to the 1 free list, but left ammonium sulphate and calcium nitrate on the dutiable list. They placed a duty on chickpeas and transferred horseradish to the dutiable list. No tariff was placed on bananas. The Senate Hearings We later presented two briefs to the Senate Finance Committee asking for revisions Jn the House Bill. We asked that the rates on some dutiable products be raised in accordance with our previous requests. We also asked for the transfers described above. We emphasized in particular the need of a duty on ammoniumj sulphate, since this fertilizer is used extensively in the fruit and vegetable in - dustry and has a pronounced effect in setting the prices on nitrogen fertilizers in general. According to our best information, the Senate has increased some of the duties in the House Bill but has left ammonium sulphate and calcium nitrate on the dutiable list. We urge that all members of the Council and Interested parties write their senators at once urging them to transfer these fertilizers to the free list.

The Farm Bill We also presented a brief before the House Agricultural Com - mittee on the Farm Bill. We outlined the principles which we felt ought to be embodied in the bill. We particularly emphasized that the plan should be such that it would be feasible from a practical standpoint for growers and their organizations. to take full advantage of the provisions of the bill, not only in highly organized sections but also in sections near markets where it is difficult to organize growers and for which no practical form of organization has been found to date. The bill as passed contains a number of provisions that were emphasized by the Council. We feel that the Council was the chief factor in keeping fruits and vegetables in the Farm Bill. Unfortunately, a few horticultural dealers favored their elimination. We believe they were influenced by dealer interests. Certainly, there can be no harm in providing for fruit and vegetable growers the same opportunities as are pro - vided for other producers. Dealer interests that have been posing as representatives of the growers at Washington succeeded in having an amendment introduced in the Senate to eliminate fruits and vegetables from the stabilization features of the farm bill. No appearances' had been made by these interests before either the Senate or the House Agricultural Commit - tee. When word reached us that they were trying to eliminate perish - ables, we Immediately wired Senate leaders and also dispatched a letter to every senator stating the reasons why fruits and vegetableE should be left in the Farm Bill with full rights the same as other commodities. We also emphasized that the dealer interests promot - ing this amendment did not represent the grower viewpoint and could not possibly speak for the fruit and vegetable industries from a grower viewpoint. Quite a number of senators expressed their ap - proval of our stand in telegrams and letters. Also, a number advised us a few days later by wire and letter that the amendment had been defeated by a large majority. Supporting Summers and Reed Bills The Council has also been supporting the Summers and Borah Bills for the licensing and' regulation of commission merchants. These bills are practically alike and are approved by the Department of Agriculture. You can help us materially by writing your representa - tives and senators and urging them to support these bills, which will probably be acted upon when the summer session is resumed. We are also supporting the Reed Bill for the regulation and truthful naming of fruit juices and by-products. This bill will have </seg>

Imports of fruit, 1927, over 3,300,000,000 pounds. Exports about two billion pounds. Imports exceeded imports by over 1,300 000 000 pounds. Imports of bananas, 1927, over three billion poundg Bananas constituted 92.5 per cent of all fruit imports by weight in 1927. Banana imports alone exceeded entire fruit exports [by over one billion pounds. Bananas create an enormous surplus problem In fruit industry. We would have a large export balance were it not for bananas. The average import price of bananas, 1927, 1.1 cents per pound; all other fruit imports, 8 cents per pound; fruit exports, 6 cents per </seg>
            <seg id="p512">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE pound. Thus two factors, large volume and low prices, are operating together to depress American fruit industry. Banana traffic has developed very largely in the last thirty years. Imports Increased about- 500 per cent since 1898. Imports in 1927, 61,009,425 bunches. Imports for year ending June 30, 1928, 64,029, - 000 bunches. Increase about 40 per cent last four years. Banana imports now exceed carlot shipments of each of our leading fruits and they equal about 30 per cent of carlot shipments of all fresh and dried fruits and 12 to 13 per cent of carlot shipments all fruits and vegeatbles. In calorie value, based on average yields, banana imports replace following acreages: Apples, 671,000; potatoes 305,000; grapes 215,000; wheat 435,000; oats 398,000, each considered separately. Bananas come chiefly from West Indies, Central and South America, Jamaica and Honduras; each ship us about 25 per cent of imports. About 250,000 bunches from Hawaii each year. Many evidences of expansion in banana industry. Investments increasing. New acreages reported from many countries. Large companies have extensive tracts of undeveloped land. Our total imports from banana countries exceed our exports to same by over $100,000,000 per year. Bananas in 1927 valued at 34 million. Thus, tariff on bananas would not damage trade. We export to banana countries less than one-tenth as much fruit as im - ported from them. Thus, American fruit growers are not gaining advantages in export trade in fruit from banana imports. Increase in exports made possible by banana imports practically all going to industrial interests or other countries. Profits from banana trade not enriching banana countries or people of those countries. Labor and facilities purchased on strictly competitive basis. - . Bananas reported in import figures at 30 to 50 cents per. bunch. According to our understanding, this is price at point of export. Bananas often purchased cheaper than this from natives. Freight to our ports not great. Cost of producing peaches about $1.00 per bushel, apples about $1.20 per bushel in country as a whole. Freight to market and refrigeration must be added, also commission, etc. American growers cannot possibly compete with the banana imports without adequate tariff to equalize conditions. Bananas grown on cheap land. Jungle not cleared before plant - ing; undergrowth cut down; rhizomes then planted; large trees later cut down. Brush, logs and stumps allowed to rot on ground. Land for American fruits must first be cleared. Growing operations ex - pensive. About $300 needed to bring acre peaches to bearing, apples $500 to $1,000. Bananas begin to bear in about year and last 10 to 15 years. No spraying and usually no fertilizing necessary. Irriga - tion occasionally employed. </seg>
            <seg id="p513">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Low grade peon labor used for growing bananas. Standard of living very low. American fruit growers and working men compelled to compete with this labor through absence of tariff on bananas. Profits from fruit growing in the United States have shown marked decline in recent years. Cost figures by Cornell University 1913-2 6 from large number of farms show average return 3 3 pe - cent on investment of $16,968; average income $858.94 allowing operator only $299 for year's work as compared with $593 paid hired men, and also not allowing average of $156 for unpaid family labor Allowance for family labor and for operator at wages of hired men would make average income per farm $408.94 These are perhaps most exhaustive cost figures available and source is without question The farms received 59 per cent of income from apples and peaches. Bananas directly compete with all American fruits Require no processing. Most people feel they need some fruit. If need is sup - plied by bananas they think other fruit unnecessary. Combined con - sumption of all fruits per capita, including bananas, has remained about the same the last' 30 years. Apple consumption per capita decreased about 32 per cent in last 30 years. Peach production de - clined about. 2% pounds or 10 per cent since 1908. Pears showed slight increase. Grapes declined from 1909 to 1919 and since have shown increase of about three pounds per capita. Raisins and cur - rants have increased about one pound per capita since 1909. Lemons and cranberries have remained about the same. Only oranges of native fruits have shown material increase. Banana imports have increased about 500 per cent since 1898. Increase in banana con - sumption has taken place at expense of American fruits. The banana is not a cheap food as represented. Calorie value can be purchased cheaper and better in large numbers of American products, including wheat flour, white bread, oat meal, rice, lard, butter, potatoes, milk, corn meal, dried beans, dried peas, and' many others. Poor people can buy food value cheaper in other products if price is consideration. American people will suffer no! loss by reducing consumption of bananas. Even some fruits will furnish' calorie value at practically same price or cheaper than bananas. Among these are grapes, raisins, prunes, cherries, fresh prunes, plums. American fruits also better sources of valuable fruit juices and fruit acids. Vitamin value of a number of native fruits superior. Bananas a very ordinary carbohydrate food. Calorie value not high. Vitamin content below "good" except for Vitamin C. Medical authorities claim bananas must show brown spots before eaten. Few people wait this long. Most bananas eaten before ready. No Ameri - can fruits need to show brown spots before eaten. Bananas constipat - ing to some people and laxative to others. Not recommended by some medical authorities for young children. Bananas show 35 per </seg>
            <seg id="p514">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE cent waste In akins. No American fruit shows so much. Lemons, 30 per cent, oranges 27 per cent, apples and grapes 25 per cent, others less. Important principle to consider in putting tariff on substitute products is content of proteins, carbohydrates, fats, minerals, calorie value. These are basic constitutients of all foods. Appetite or taste is simply a reaction of bodily demand. From standpoint of nutrients for body needs, bananas compete directly with all American fruits and foods. Tariff on bananas and other food substitutes readily justi - fied in this basis. We produce some bananas in U. S. territory, including Florida, Canal Zone, Hawaii, Philippines. We have tariffs on numerous pro - ducts not produced in' U. 9., including spices, silk and silk products, cork and cork bark, Brazil nuts, cocoanuts, cocoanut oil, cocoa butter, chocolate, diamonds. Oriental rugs, etc. . Tariff on bananas far more justified than tariff on spices because latter carried no food value. Pineapples produced in only small way on mainland of U. S. and yet carry high tariff. Lemons, dates, figs and other fruits grown in limited areas only and yet carry tariffs. On the other hand, there is no duty on many products we produce in quantities, including petro - leum, coal, cement, bricks, gold, silver, etc. No consistency in tariff law in these respects. Will violate no precedents or establish any new policies by' placing tariff on bananas. A tariff now exists on dried bananas. Amount of duty requested by N. H. C, 1% cents per pound on the gross weight. This amount needed to protect industry and cause consumers to show slight price' reference for American fruits. Slight - ly increased prices will be hardship to no one. The revenue will de - crease taxation. Practically entire benefit from this will go to city people. Duty will increase buying power of fruit industry and stimu - late purchase of "manufactured products. Fruit growers will work at greater efficiency and create more wealth as a result of tariff. In - dustry, business, and city people will reap many benefits. Tariff will protect American labor in general and farm labor in particular from low grade tropical labor and cheap production conditions. A service will be rendered to American people in economy and health by en - couraging greater consumption of American fruits. </seg>
            <seg id="p515">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON SESSION JANUARY 8, 1930 THE PRESIDENT: The first paper on this afternoon's program is by Mr. A. E. Anderson, State and Federal Statistician. Unfor - tunately Mr. Anderson is unable to be with us today but he has sent one of his staff to substitute for him. I am pleased to introduce to you Mr. A. Jones of the office of the State and Federal Statistician. MR. JONES: Mr. President and members of the Horticultural Society. I am sure that Mr. Anderson could have presented this paper much better than I can. My work has been largely with live stock statistics. However, I will do the best I can and try to answer any of the questions pertaining to this work. VALUE OP FRUIT ESTIMATES TO THE GROWER By A. E. ANDERSON, State and Federal Statistician I am going to talk a few minutes on the value of fruit estimates to the grower. I can tell you very little else about your business that you don't already know. Some of you may also be well versed in the production statistics of your business. This recalls a little experi - ence we had with one member of your society last fall. He said we were off on our estimates of the apple crop. He asserted that .we would not have half as many apples as last year and he knew what he was talking about, because he had traveled, not only all of south - eastern Nebraska but also northeastern Kansas. Since this criticism came from a man who is generally considered to be well informed not only on the apple business but also on the general crop conditions throughout the state because he travels considerably, we gave more than the usual consideration to his complaint. We sent out a special inquiry and even invited a biased and pessimistic report. The results did lower the condition estimate somewhat from previous reports and since I happened to be a member of the Crop Reporting Board at Washington for the September report which was the first report fol - lowing this gentleman's criticism I succeeded in getting the estimates reduced appreciably. What was the outcome? By October 5, the shipments had reached 49 cars as compared with 40 cars for the 1928 season. By November 1 the shipments were double those of the previous year and the final result will show about 2 % times as many, instead of being less as this critic asserted. After we had delivered the evidence, he still contended we were "all wet" on our estimate of twice the yield of last season. He next offered to bet a new hat we were too high on the corn estimate. We advised him, th$t In our </seg>
            <seg id="p516">REPORT OK NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE opinion, the final estimate of corn would be even higher than the present, and this contention was since supported by over 2,000 Nebras - ka farmers in their final estimates of yield. So, in the minds of some we are not only wrong when we are wrong but also when we are right. Getting down to the subject, we want you to know that great development has been made in crop reporting methods. That on the cotton crop upon which we have an absolute check, we have been accurate to within 2%. That is the average error for 20 years is about I'/r. We feel that the work in Nebraska is more accurate than that in the cotton belt. Few, if any states have a better developed system of gathering acreage data through the assessors than we have in Nebraska. No other state has a greater accumulation of absolute records of farm production than we have in Nebraska. However, even though we won out over our critics on the Nebras - ka apple crop this year as well as on the corn crop and even though our crop reporting service is one of the most highly developed, we will admit that our methods of gathering estimates on fruit crops are not so well developed as for other crops, chiefly because we have given most attention to the leading crops.' The value of Nebraska's fruit crops Is less than one-half of one per cent of the total value of all crops. Inasmuch as we do not have as much time to put other crops and livestock as we need, it is only natural for us to slight the less Important crops, particularly when we have experienced so much difficulty in getting apple growers to cooperate. Perhaps they think like our critic did, that we are "all wet" on our estimates any way and that it would not help any to cooperate. In conducting our apple survey two or three years ago, we had to write to some of our growers over half a dozen times, but, to get a report patience is one of the essentials of a successful statistician. Nebraska's commercial apple industry has been developing quite rapidly since 1920. It Is only natural that this development should take place. Those of you who have studied the production statistics of your business, know that between 1910 and 1920, Nebraska's bear - ing apple trees had been reduced over 67%, that is, more than two - thirds of them died out,. and the apple trees under bearing age suf - fered a reduction of over 58%. The uncared for farm orchard dis - appeared rapidly during that decade not only in Nebraska but through - out the central states. By 1920, you men saw the greater market possibilities of supplying the central states with apples of high grade. You saw a great advantage in freight rates over the northeast and the northwest in meeting this demand for apples from the central states and according to our special apple survey, in Cass, Otoe, Nemaha and Richardson counties, leading commercial apple growers had over three times as many apple trees of all ages in 1926 as they had in 1920. Not only do you have a decided advantage in freight rates </seg>
            <seg id="p517">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY over competing territory in supplying the large territory of the central states, but you have an additional. advantage in that no other section can produce better flavored apples than such leading varieties as Winesap, Jonathan, Delicious, Black Twig and Grimes Golden. The northwest gets a better color, the irrigated sections and possibly the northeast gets a larger size, but for flavor, Nebraska beats all sections in these varieties.. Nebraska's loose soil is ideal for apples. Salable apples can no longer be produced without expert care. Statistics on apple, trees gathered through the assessors since 1920 Indicates that the average farmer is losing interest in the farm orchard. He apparently can use his ground to better advantage in growing other crops and buy his apples .from commercial growers. The de - mand for apples through truck operators and the "automobile trade" is good evidence of this. In my opinion, you have about two leading statistical; problems, first, the annual production estimates for Nebraska, all other states and for the country as a whole, and second, new planting, not only locally but for all states. The former affects your profits more or less each year and the latter is the long time aspect which may also affect your profits. Had all other states increased their production as heavily as Nebraska has during the last decade, we would soon be facing an over production of apples which might make the industry unprofitable. This can be avoided entirely through the periodical gathering of statistics on bearing and non-bearing trees, and future production can be adjusted to meet future demand. The monthly production estimates of apples are determined from the monthly reports of condition, or percentage of a full crop, and from basic pars used. The latter are obtained from the federal census when complete data on bearing trees and production are obtained. The 1924 census gave us a production of 932,785 bushels of apples. Our reports from growers indicates the production to be 74% of a full crop. Naturally a full crop would be 932.785 bushels divided by 74% times 100, the latter that is 100% representing a full crop. This gives us a par of 1,260, 000. bushels as a full crop. Suppose then, the percentage of a full crop indicated by crop reporters was 60%, then 60% of 1,260,000 equals 756,000 bushels which would be the forecast. Adjustments In pars are made In Intervening years between the census years for the change in number of bearing trees; the latter being obtained from inquiry or special surveys. Estimates for the commercial apple crop are obtained in exactly the same manner. Pars, or 100 % equivalents of production are ob - tained from the federal census based upon the actual sales of apples. This is not limited to what you may class as the strictly commercial apple crop, but It includes all apples sold as fresh fruit whether it comes from strictly commercial, or from farm orchards. This Is one reason why the official estimates of the commercial apple crop are </seg>
            <seg id="p518">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE much larger than the actual carlot shipments. Furthermore, your crop of apples In commercial sections of southeastern Nebraska can no longer be measured in terms of car load lots because of the truck and automobile trade. Your apples that Are sold for the manufacture of vinegar or cider are also classed as commercial apples according to the Bureau's definition of commercial apples, which is all apples sold as fresh fruit. This will explain why, the commercial apple estimates exceed considerably the quantity that is shipped in car load lots. There may be some criticism on this manner of denning the commercial apple crop, as being that portion of the total apple crop that is sold as fresh fruit regardless as to whether it comes from strictly commercial apple orchards or from farm orchards. However, . all apples sold, whether they come from the farm orchard or from the strictly commercial orchard, do their bit toward supplying a market demand for apples and both are factors in determining price. If, for example, the sales from farm orchards are large, the demand for apples from the strictly commercial growers 1b reduced according - ly. From this standpoint, it seems desirable to continue to classify as commercial apples, all apples that are sold as fresh fruit. " In Nebraska, the sale of apples, other than those produced by commer - cial growers is becoming less because salable apples cannot be pro - duced without using proper spraying methods and care. The federal census of agriculture will be taken this year. Pro - duction statistics will be gathered on the 1929 crop. The number of trees of bearing age, and the number under bearing age and the pro-' ductlon will be asked for all fruits. Another question will call for the acreage of each tree fruit and the quantity sold. Similar Infor - mation will be collected for grape vines, but for other kinds of small fruits, only acreage and production will be asked. This will give- us adequate statistics on fruits.' It will furnish a new base, for the annual estimates of production. Beginning this year, this office desires to further develop its work in fruit estimating. It will need the full cooperation of all growers. If you are interested in the annual production estimates which affects the price and your profits, if you are Interested in the long time aspect of the industry, that is the rate of new plantings, the loss of old trees from which the prospective change in bearing trees is taking place and consequently the future production which will ultimately react on the future price and profits of the industry, we appeal to you to give us full and united cooperation to the fruit reporting aspect of your industry. This office will be glad to have any suggestions you have to offer. With your full cooperation, we will be in a position to give you al - most anything you desire in the way of the statistics on your business. We cannot change the nature of the information requested by the federal government which must be uniform throughout the various </seg>

We can deliver 100% in results If you will deliver 100% in cooperation. Thank you! THE PRESIDENT: Are there any questions pertaining to this topic that any of you would care to ask Mr. Jones? If not we will continue with our program. At this time we will vary a j little from the printed program. Both Mr. Bode and Dr. Murneek are anxious to get away from these meetings in time to catch train's late this afternoon. For this reason we will hear from Mr. Bode now and then from Dr. Murneek. So then, we will hear from Mr. I. T. Bode, Evten - sion Forester for Iowa, who will talk to you on "Possibilities in Com - mercial Nut Growing." Mr. Bode. ■ SOME I'OSSIHIIjITIKS IN THE USES OF NATIVE NUT TREES By I. T. BODE, Extension Forester, Iowa State College. In studying over the situation with regard to varieties of nut trees native to the north central states and their possibilities as culti - vated crops, one is confronted first of all with the fact that, as with many other forms of fruits, the search for select native parent stock has started after the best is gone. We usually awaken to such cir - cumstances only when we have misused the prime gifts | of Nature. Then, we try to get consolation from the statement of some pioneer that the nuts exhibited at some particular show are not half as good as those he used to have in his timber. But, be the past as It may, no bygone wealth of resources should justify a continuance of misuse or of the attitude which permitted loss of the superior things of Nature. I mean simply this: the time has come when everyone who knows anything about any exceptionally good parent native nut tree in his section of the world should make it his duty to see that such is preserved and that it is brought to the attention of those who can pass judgment upon it. One never knows when there will spring to light something far superior to anything yet found. That 1b happen - ing every year with our native nut trees. In presenting to you the following information, I ask you to accept it simply for the information it may contain. I can not feel that I am justified, in the light of the present status of development of our native varieties, in predicting how many dollars per acre you can count on from nut tree orchards, or what comparison you can make between them and other agricultural crops in this section. The </seg>
            <seg id="p520">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE work with the northern nut varieties as yet is too new to make any such deductions. That there are certain very considerable values to be considered possible should in no way be minimized. For example on certain charts I saw several years ago listing the food-iron value of food pro - ducts, I noted that the following nut products were all listed in. the upper half of the chart; namely, almonds which came above oatmeal, pecans which stood above currants, and walnuts which stood above raisins. I also noted that there were none of the nuts listed in the lower half of the chart. On a second chart, I was interested to find that almonds were listed with vitamines, A and B and with C doubt - ful; hickory nuts' with a good supply of vitamin B, with A and C doubtful; pecans containing vitamin B, with A and C doubtful, and walnuts with a large vitamin B content and A and C doubtful. Vita - min D, I believe, was an unknown quantity at that time. Unquestionably, if these figures be true, we find an explanation of why it was that the California Indians were able to make such a staple food from acorns and nut products. The value of nut and acorn crops as food for beasts as well as their food value to man in niany of the European countries are facts which have long been known. We must recognize, however, that our own agricultural condi - tions and the supplies of other highly nutritive foods have perhaps altered the relation of nut crops to the food supply of the country. Nevertheless, I have run into a number of problems relative to nut trees which have made me realize more than ever that nuts have not received the consideration which they are' entitled to as tree crops. I have in mind particularly a walnut grove in Buena Vista county, one in Ida county and one in Monona county, Iowa, all of which are in splendid condition but concerning which there arises this problem. Shall we allow the grove to continue for lumber production or shall we thin heavy enough to open the crowns for nut production? Again, I have in mind some work being carried on by a farmer near Hum - boldt, Iowa. He takes a particular interest in trees and especially in various varieties of nut trees. I visited his place just a short time ago and found there the following: Norway Spruce, Blue Spruce, White Pine, Austrian Pine, an exceptionally large Balsam Fir, a large Hemlock, Black Walnut (4 varieties), Butternuts, Japanese Walnut, Missouri Hickory, Iowa Hickory, Filberts, Chestnut, Beech, White Bur and Red Oak, White Birch and several other varieties of trees. The nut trees have all been raised from the nuts themselves and the sur - prising thing is the volunteer . growth of young seedlings which are coming up all over the grove. To me, this emphasizes the possibili - ties in nut crops and the value of being able in some way to help men who are interested in propositions such as these so as to get the greatest actual value from them. During the past few years there have come 'to the Extension Office many inquiries regarding different phases of the problems of growing nut trees. </seg>
            <seg id="p521">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Let me give you a few of the inquiries exactly as they come to us. 1. From Humboldt county: A man is planning on putting out an acre or so of nuts and acorns both for shade to the pasture and for the fruits. He askB, "Can I gather my seed locally and plant it or must I purchase better seed or use trees?" 2. A man In Iowa county had a lot of walnuts on a young grove 20 to 25 years old. One fall, he planned on turning some of the crop into revenue. A few days later the following information was received. "I did not get a thing done with the walnuts. We were just too far behind with our work, and not able to hire help. I did get a few sackf ulls picked up but I notice a lot of them seem shrivelled inside. Now, I would like to get a little information along this line. How do the commercial growers handle their crop so as to put out a good product?" To my mind this reply contains not only the question of how to handle the nut crop but, perhaps more important, the question of how far we can go in occupying the farmer's time with the spec - ialities. 3. A man in Monona county asked for some assistance in wood - lot management. His walnut grove is typical of many others in the same. locality. He has a good grove but it has been allowed to grow too thick. . This was the problem he was confronted with. "What Hhall I do — thin for nuts, thin for posts, or thin for larger lumber? The windbreak value is of Importance to me." 4. One County Agent asks: "Is it a good practice to cut the tap root of walnuts before transplanting?" 5. Another County Agent asks: "Can we do anything to prevent our walnuts and butternuts from dropping before they are ripe?" (Some samples were sent in and apparently the nuts were free from any disease or Insect.) 6. A short time ago the following problem was put to the Exten - sion Department: There is a possibility of Obtaining a piece of land now owned by the state for the use of the locality and especially as an area for the local Boy Scout work. At present, this is an old stream bed growing up to rather an inferior type of forest growth. Here is the question: "What are the possibilities of our planting this area to some of the more valuable trees, especially to nut trees, with the idea in mind of raising a forest crop both for wood and nuts and in the future for producing a revenue, to help with the expenses of the local Boy Scout Organization." 7. Another inquiry is as follows: "Can we raise a two-storied crop; that is, nut trees planted- with other trees which could be used for post timber? Our idea is to have the nut trees form the perman - ent crop and perhaps furnish shade in the pasture after the post crop is harvested." 8. Here is still another inquiry. "Can we use nut trees on steep hillsides which we do not want to clear because of erosion, and plant </seg>
            <seg id="p522">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE them close enough for complete forest cover and yet get a worth while nut crop?" I believe these are enough to illustrate clearly that the problems of nut tree planting are very closely related with many other forest and farm problems and that before we promote too large a program we should stop to consider carefully some of the things we ought to do and keep in mind. First, I believe we should use judgment in holding forth nut growing as a new big money crop for the farmers. We who are occupied tn some particular line are apt to grow extremely enthusiastic over that particular phase and are apt to make too general application of certain instances of good revenue from special crops. I think we must always keep in mind that the large per cent of the central states' crop is corn, hogs and staple farm products and. that, for example, the value of nut crops as stock food will have to meet the comparison of fattening pork and beef on corn. The economy of harvesting the nut crop by stock feeding on it, will in itself have to meet the practice of "hogging down" corn, the use of soybeans in corn, etc. On the other hand, I do not agree that every acre in this section is better suited to some agricultural crop beside the growing of trees. I believe that all of pur pastures should be provided with shade and that many of these trees might just as well be nut trees. There are many of our acres which because of physiography, rocky soils, etc., arc primarily tree acres. Some of these no doubt may be made agri - cultural but only made so and retained at a high expense which the land at present yields is unable to bear and show a profit. • This will no ilmiht be the condition for a good many years to come. I believe all indications are that high expenses will remain on the land and that we must make our profits with (1) Increased yields (which is' of no avail) unless our markets increase commensurately and keep up the demand, with (2) decreased cost of production or (3) utiliza - tion of land not now in its tfest state of production for possible side - line crops for extra revenues. In general, therefore, I believe that In considering any program of nut crop production, we must consider all phases of the problem and especially if we consider urging nuts as future farm crops. In the second place, I believe we ought to start now to sell future nut crops. I mean that we ought to begin to create consump - tion. We should indicate to the people the value of nut crops and develop the idea of using more of them. In this way, we might ac - complish something along the line of- having the market ready by the time the crops are produced. Perhaps the campaign of the raisin growers of the west is one of the most striking examples of this type of education. . ■ ' In the third place, we ought to try to help some of the farmers to harvest present nut crops and, if possible, to market them system- </seg>
            <seg id="p523">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY attcally. I have in mind a number of localities where good nut crops of one type or another are produced nearly every year, but, from the market standpoint, they have little or no value at present. In the last place, I believe that we should try in every way possible to give assistance to men who of their own accord are carry - ing on very interesting work in the raising of nut crops. It is a hobby with them and they are accomplishing some good results, but the chief value of the work is lost because it is not done systematically and records are not carefully kept, or because it will not be per - petuated when they are gone. I believe we could sum up the situation and locate the place of nut crops and tree crops in the general scheme of agriculture by reviewing one paragraph from "The World's Food Resources," by J. Russell Smith. "Tree crops may render this Service to Man's attempt to utilize the earth and increase the food supply:" (1) They permit us to grow crops in land too rocky to be plowed; (2) They produce crops on land too steep to be plowed; (3) They thrive on land too dry for grain, (for the tree is the most drouth-resistant of plants); (4) They permit a two-story agriculture, trees above and tilled crop beneath; (5) They offer valuable substitutes for meat as well as for bread; (6) They are well adapted for plans for conservation of natural resources. Having given you these remarks as my own opinion of some of the economic possibilities in growing native northern nut tree crops, let me turn to some of the experiences which have been had In the actual development of the work. As with any product, we practically start out with the knowl - edge that, if the nut crop is going to become a marketable commodity, it must be standard and of as nearly superior quality as we can get it. This then, from the standpoint of nut fruit production, answers pretty well, to you folks who understand the uncertainty of offspring from native fruit seeds, the question of whether we can plant miscellaneous crops of nuts, or even crops from selected trees and expect anything from them commercially. If we can not do that, then we have left two other possibilities of production. They are: first, the seeking out and propagation by asexual methods of the best native material that Is left to us in Nature, and second: the careful selective breeding up of better kinds. If the second of these' methods is too laborious a process for the aver - age crop producer with such things as apples and ordinary fruit crops, it is a good many more' times so with nut trees, because of the length of time necessary to produce crops. However, I am of the opinion that we have exaggerated this difficulty, and that by use of top-work - ing and other methods we can hasten the usual period necessary to wait for results. But, suffice it to Bay, that, at the present stage of the game in nut propagation work, and for most of us, we are wise </seg>
            <seg id="p524">4 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE in devoting effort to seeking out and propagating asexually some of the better native parent trees as they come to light. I do not wish to minimize the importance of the breeding work, but I feel that this should become largely the program of experiment stations and institu - tions which can disregard the time element better than can the in - dividual. In the start of this work, as was to be expected, many varieties were propagated which since have been surpassed. But the work dona created good interest and was the means of saving some very superior material. Today, I feel safe in saying that, before anyone spends much effort in attempting to propagate some of the things which to him seem of unusual quality unless it be to gain perfection in the mere execution of the processes, he should make the effort to have the fruit passed upon by the most experienced. We have arrived at the stage where certain standards of quality have become enough established, and where enough high quality material has been pre - served that it would be foolish to spend a lot of time with something mediocre. This being true, what is required of a nut to be a good one? What is required of the tree by way of production possibilities? This chart will put before us in the most concise way the things which have to be considered in making the above choices. Chart I— What is a Good Nut?

It must have an observed record of regular bearing habits. 3. It must be reasonably prolific in fruiting. (Due allowance made for forest conditions.) 4. It should produce uniform fruits. 5. It must flower and mature its fruits with a minimum possibility of late spring and early fall frost damage. After all, you will note, that these requirements are very little different from those. demanded of nearly all of our native fruits. The weighing of the various points should not be taken too finally, because as the work progresses and varieties become standardized the scale will change. The point to be emphasized here is that nut propagation has already reached the stage where we can become particular concern - ing the fruit worth preserving. Along with this, however, we should not fail to emphasize the important fact that without question the best may still be tucked away in someone's back pasture. The search Itself has not been finished. Keep looking. Again, when it comes to methods of propagation, to the man familiar with general fruit tree propagation there will appear at once a great similarity to the things he has been acquainted with. But, the best of fruit tree propagators have fallen down miserably at first when applying these same methods to nut trees. While in the main the methods are the same, the fine points of the technique, the specialized "wrinkles in the game" so to speak, are very essential to success. Let me give you a few examples of what I mean. In conclusion, I have brought a few specimens of some of the most satisfactory nuts today for tTie state of Iowa. Their past history will be a guide for you, but, of course, only trial will ultimately answer the question.

            <seg id="p526">KEPOHT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE THE PRESIDENT: Are there any questions regarding nut grow - ing that any of you want to ask Mr. Bode? Next we will have the paper on "The Stationary Spray Outfit" that we didn't have time for in the morning session. I am pleased to introduce to you Mr. Wm. Abildgaard, Sales Man - aged of the John Bean Manufacturing Company of Lansing, Mich. THE STATIONARY SPRAY OUTFIT IS HERB TO STAY By WM. ABILDGAARD, Sales Manager, John Bean Mfg. Co., Lansing Michigan. Many of the most successful mechanical ideas were born in a period of necessity. This is certainly very true of Stationary Spraying. To the best of my knowledge the idea was first conceived by Mr. Hayward Reed of Sacramento, California, over twenty years ago. Mr. Reed has a very large pear orchard in the delta lands between the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers of California. Every year at the time his scab sprays should be applied the snow melting in the moun - tains swells the rivers which floor his orchard, making it impossible to do a thorough Job of spraying with portable sprayers. He even tried carrying small, portable sprayers in boats, using long lengths of hose, and from this experience conceived the idea of laying pipe lines throughout the orchard. Numerous mistakes were made in the first installation, namely; too small pipe lines and loss of pressure due to friction. However, after one year's experience It was very easy to arrive at the proper pipe line sizes and Mr. Reed has used the stationary system of spraying ever since. It was not long after this that the stationary idea started in the Pacific Northwest. Here it also came, because of necessity. Some of the very best apple orchards of the Wenatchee Valley are planted on hills so steep that it is almost impossible to spray them with portable machines. In the beginning pipe lines were laid on top of the ground, running from a road at the top of the hill to the bottom. The grower would then connect his portable spray machine to this pipe line, which worked out very well, with the exception of a considerable loss of time in returning to the filling station for each load of material. Soon complete orchards were piped from one permanent plant which was generally housed in a building large enough to store spray materials, as well as protect the plant from the weather. For several years the growers of the Northwest watched the stationary spray machines in operation ' very closely. Two things caused them to hold back. One was the cost of the piping and the </seg>
            <seg id="p527">Nebraska sTaTE Ho&amp;tiCultuRal society other was the question of the materials settling in the pipe lines. Their fears of the materials settling were soon overcome and the many advantages of stationary spraying proved themselves to a point where every Northwest grower soon realized that it was not a question of whether or not he could afford to come to stationary spraying, but a question of whether he could afford not to. The need of stationary sprayers for their conditions soon proved itself so strongly that a grower with any credit at all could easily obtain the money from his bank for buying stationary spraying equipment. In the past four or five years the sale of spray machines in Oregon and Washington has been at least 90 to 96% stationary and 5 to 10% portable. Many growers in the Eastern States have installed stationary systems and many others are considering it. However, there is really not so much to be gained with the stationary system, under average conditions, In the East. As explained previously, the first stationary sprayers in the West were installed to meet a condition impossible to meet with a portable machine. However, many conditions that can be handled with a port - able machine are much more efficiently handled with the stationary system. As there is practically no summer cultivation in the West the long system of pruning is generally practiced and with the trees seldom planted more than 28 to 32 feet apart you can well understand that by the first of June the weight of the fruit has brought the branches out to the center of the rows and by the first of July it is generally necessary to commence propping the branches. By this time .every tree has been thinned and every apple left on the trees should be saved. You can easily imagine the damage that would be done by pulling a portable sprayer through an orchard under these conditions. Not only is a great deal of fruit destroyed, but it is often necessary to go ahead removing props until the machine has passed through. Another trouble often encountered is the breaking up of the Irriga - tion ditches. It is necessary to keep a small amount of water flowing through these' ditches, which are placed from 2 to 3 feet apart, all during the summer. In pulling a portable machine through the orchard it often becomes stuck in the mud, but more often breaks down the ditches and unless they are built up immediately the water will start washing down the hillside which can easily cause considerable damage. These are conditions that the Eastern grower is seldom con - fronted with, but there are sufficient advantages left to make station - ary spraying a profitable investment to some of the Eastern growers. There is no question but what the same number of men with a stationary system can spray an orchard In 30 to 40% less time than with portable machines, provided the system Is laid out in a practical way. If not laid out properly the result can very easily be In the ' opposite direction. </seg>
            <seg id="p528">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE It is often said that "what is worth doing at all is worth doing well" and that is certainly true when it comes to laying out a station - ary system. Many of the growers in the Eastern States who first installed stationary systems did not follow the practice of the Western grower and while they have generally claimed their plants were a great suc - cess I doubt very much if they can prove thiB. They might prove their statements if they compared the results of their stationary plants with the results obtained with an old, worn-out, low pressure, portable machine, but the comparison should be between an up-to-date station - ary plant and an up-to-date, high pressure, large capacity, portable machine. .

The information I have to give you 1b nothing original on my part. It is simply from the experiences of hundreds of growers who have used stationary sprayers for a number of years, as well as the experience I have had laying out and installing a great many systems. I do not have available charts or figures' on exact costs or savings, but can give you the advantage of a great deal of practical experience. Two different systems have been used. The .return system and the dead end system. The return system was first used because the growers felt it necessary to keep the material continually in motion in order to pre - vent settling in the pipe lines. This type of system has been entirely </seg>
            <seg id="p529">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY discontinued in the Western States in favor of the dead end system and while practically all of the first plants in the East were the re - turn system I do not know of anyone any longer considering that type. There is too much loss of pressure and the additional cost on account of the extra pipe required makes the investment very high, with noth - ing to be gained. The dead end system is much the cheaper and is a much more efficient system, provided the proper sizes of pipe are used. Nothing smaller than %-inch pipe should be used for laterals and in some cases, where the laterals must be long and the capacity to be used with the gun large, a 1-inch lateral is advisable. The size of main all depends on the length and the volume of material to be put through it. Loss of. pressure due to friction and elevation must be considered and. just as important is velocity. Spray materials should move through the pipe at a speed of not less than 2% feet per second and if this is done there will be no danger of the materials settling in the pipe lines, even though Bordeaux, Arsenate of Lead or New Jersey Dry Mix is used. Friction tables will be furnished by all sprayer manufacturers to any grower interested in stationary spray - ing systems. The next question is whether the pipe lines should be placed on top of the ground, underground or through the trees. * The objection to laying the pipe lines on top of the ground is cultivation and driving through the orchards when removing the fruit. The advantages are that it is generally easy to drain, cheap to install and that it is easy to find leaks in the pipe. The underground system was the one generally used in the begin - ning. The advantage is having the pipe lines entirely out of the way, not interfering with any of the orchard operations. The disadvantages are the locating of leaking pipes and drainage, as well as the cost of Installation. The advantages of the overhead system are that it also is out of the way of other orchard operations, it is very easy to locate leak - age and is easy to drain. It is also much cheaper to install than the underground system. There are practically no disadvantages to the overhead system, if installed . properly. The question as to what kind of pipe to use often comes up. Ordinary steel pipe is absolutely O. K. and it is not necessary to use extra heavy pipe. Black steel pipe has been used in some cases, but years of experience has convinced most growers that it pays to buy galvanized pipe. There is now a copper alloy pipe on the market that we believe is very good and worth the extra cost, which is only about 5 or 6 % . It can also be had in both black or galvanized. In figuring frictions and sizes of pipe it Is best to figure your system so that you will not find it necessary to use over 500 pounds pressure at the plant and not less than 350 pounds at the most distant point. In other words, try not to have more than a difference of 150 </seg>
            <seg id="p530">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE pounds between your plant and the most distant point in your orchard because you will find that a spray man using 500 pounds in one part of the orchard and less than 350 pounds in another will not do a very good job- with the lower pressure. ' One of the most important parts of your installation 1b the spray pattern and this is a rather bard thing to explain without drawings, but drawings which make the different patterns very plain can be obtained from the sprayer manufacturers. There has been a great deal or discussion about the lengths of hose to be used. 125 or 130 feet of hose can be handled very satisfactorily by one man in what is known as the long pattern, but 100 feet should be the limit for ono man in the square pattern. I do not believe that more than one man should ever be on a length of hose. One of the advantages to station - ary spraying is the saving in labor and if your system is arranged so that it is necessary to have an extra man with each spray man to carry the hose I cannot see where very much, if any labor, can be J 1 SQUARE PIPE SYSTEM ON sntAT «i/r/vr-+J seuMe planting. 0at£ K«£vr N jj /oooooooooo ma,» u**S 1L i OO r OO0 2° 0 111 / ° o- o o o o o ■ j o o o—j-mm Vo oooooooooo ♦ — mosc valvc &lt;p o O O^OOOOO^O OO inSZmSnVhbJp o (ona o™3 oc|ooo or THUS S PR Ay CD JO OjOOjOOOlOOJOOO ***££"* " ose P ° °.!° oo o oj o o-o o o /o o o!o o o ,o oj o o o o o •/ooolooooojooooo • / o o o u 6""oTo~6~b o ■ o o o q saved. In addition to this it is perfectly natural when you put two men out in the orchard together that there will be a certain amount of loafing and talking, but if one man is put - out there all by himself with nothing to do but to spray he will generally spray and nothing else but. Where the shorter lengths of hose are used it will naturally bo necessary to run the laterals closer together, which means more pipe, but within two or three years the saving in labor will much more than pay the difference. Another thing to consider is the fact that your pipe will last you at least 20 years or. more, but the hose, being used at high pressure, at best will not last more than one or two years. </seg>
            <seg id="p531">HEbRASKA STATE HOfcTlCULTURAlJ SOCIETY I Still another point to consider is the fact that it is not always easy to pick up men for handling the hose at spray time and one of the things you should figure on accomplishing with the stationary spray system Is to eliminate men rather than add men to your crew. • Before you can properly decide your lay-out you should decide on your entire spraying program and that program must be followed thereafter or the system will be completely out of balance as to velocity and friction. It is best to divide the; orchard into as many parts as you will use guns and have each man spray the same block throughout the year. In this way it is very easy to keep a check on your men, not only as to the amount of work being done, but the efficiency of their work as well. The men should be instructed that they are not out there to see how many. trees they can spray p«r day, but how well they can spray them. Often a prize is put up for the best work and you will be sur - prised to see how they will compete for that prize and how hard they will try to do a better job of spraying than the other fellow. When harvesting time comes the results will generally be very plain, and it will be easy to decide which man wins the prize. Regarding the construction and type of power plant. Electricity, if available, is to be preferred. If not, a direct connected 4-cyIinder engine is next best. Belt drive is Often used very satisfactorily where the user has a tractor available at spray time. The pump is perhaps the most important part of the power unit and a slow speed, heavy duty pump should be used. The pressure used will generally be much higher than the pressure on the average portable sprayers, therefore, a more heavily constructed and larger capacity pump than ordinarily used on portable machines will be found to give greater efficiency. The tanks can be constructed of wood, concrete or steel. Wood has generally given by far the best satisfaction and is no more expen - sive. A great deal of attention should be paid to agitation as a tank of 500 to 1,000 gallon capacity should be used and In these large tanks thorough agitation 1b very necessary. Either two tanks or one large tank with a division in the center should be used so that the man at the plant can be preparing one tank while the other is being sprayed out. In this, way there is no loss of time in the orchard. The location of your plant will depend on the water supply, also power line if electricity is used. It is of course, best to place the plant as near the center of the orchard as possible, but this cannot be done unless water for gravity filling of the tanks Is available at that point. In the larger orchards where it is necessary to place the plant at one end of the orchard it will be necessary to use larger main pipe lines than would be necessary where the outfit could be placed some - where near the center. </seg>
            <seg id="p532">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE THE PRESIDENT: Our next number has to do with the use of fertilizers in the orchard, The use of commercial fertilizers is com - paratively new in Nebraska. In Missouri the Horticultural Department has done considerable experimental work with the use of commercial fertilizers. Dr. Murneek, I am sure, can tell us something about these matters that will be helpful. Dr. Murneek. ..'.. HOW TO KEEP YOUNG APPLE TREES VIGOROUS By DR. A. E. MURNEEK, University of Missouri. When a very young apple tree is received from the nursery it usually shows a most splendid development. Evidently it is the nurseryman's business to grow large and healthy stock. This goal is attained only by unstinted attention to the cultivation and fertilization of soil and a watchful protection' of the trees from diseases and insect pests. In general all. nursery stock is grown in a rather rich soil which is scrupulously clean of all other vegetation. Coming from such a favorable and protected environment, the young tree is exposed, as a rule, to quite different conditions in the orchard. The shock of digging and replanting with the necessary pruning of roots and branches does not harm the tree so much as the subsequent lack of care and protection. Indeed, too much stress can - not be placed on this point. Every year scores of young orchards and thousands of small trees are damaged and even destroyed by neglect, despite the fact that the very best stock may have been secured and carefully planted. Thus all hope of establishing a successful and profitable orchard may be blasted at the very beginning. The under - taking will come to naught sooner or later. It all goes to Bay that a young fruit tree cannot shift for itself in an ordinary orchard. It must be protected from the severe com - petition with wild and more robust plants. It is no match against common grass and a host of rapidly growing weeds, even though by comparison their above ground parts may appear small in size. The roots of weeds are usually more extensive than those of a fruit tree. To provide the proper soil environment at least a strip of ground should be cultivated for a distance of .5 or 6 feet on both sides of the row of trees. If this is not feasible, due to erosion, then the soil should be spaded up to the same distance around each tree. Clean cultivation during the first eight years is generally advisable. It will not only remove all other vegetation frdm the root area of the tree, but by hastening bacterial action and decomposition of organic matter, will release more plant food than is present in the soil. Cultivation should be maintained till the middle of summer when it may be dis - continued to . facilitate the proper maturing of wood as a protection against winter injury. V </seg>
            <seg id="p533">. NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL) SOCIETY During seasons of a scanty rainfall, cultivation will tend to con - serve effectively the moisture supply. Growth and development of an apple tree may be severely checked by 'lack of water in the soil. As a consequence, the foliage will be lost early in the fall and the branches will remain thin and scrawny. During a dry summer trees surrounded by much vegetation will sufTer frequently from a serious attack of grasshoppers and other chewing insects. A large part of the leaves may thus be destroyed and even the bark gnawed off the smaller twigs. Trees so injured will grow less and produce fewer leaves and buds the next. year. A young orchard may be inter-cropped with vegetables or small fruits, especially strawberries, without material damage to the trees. An income is thus . produced from the land before the bearing age of the trees is attained: One should go cautiously, however, In planting corn too closely to the trees. This crop requires, not only a large quantity of soil nutrients, but exerts a very heavy demand on the moisture supply of the soil. In light open soils corn may seriously reduce the vitality and check the normal development of fruit trees. One of the most important features of protection of trees is spraying. Because it does not bear any or only a small number of fruits during the first few years, the young orchard is often sadly neglected in this respect. Many sprays, of course, are applied pri - marily for the protection of fruit, but others are for the preservation of health of the vegetative parts. No disease or insect pests should be allowed to destroy the foliage, since only the leaves are able to elaborate the food that is necessary for the rapid development of the plant. A tree with poor foliage will never make any headway. Spray - ing must be for a particular disease or insect, ,not just seasonal. The first signs of an injury should be noted and the ' necessary control measures taken' promptly to combat the pesi. No orchard can be grown successfully without proper spraying. In years of rapid succulent growth, fire blight is often serious on young trees. It pays to remove the blighted twigs as soon as dis - covered. This work is relatively inexpensive due to the small size of the plants. Vigor in the young apple tree is not maintained by too heavy annual pruning. While at planting, the branches are cut back severely in order to balance the top with the reduced root system, pruning dur - ing the subsequent years should be quite light. Most trees, however, will need some thinning out of branches and j the heading back of a few twigs to develop a balanced and sturdy frame. Heavy pruning, especially heading back, will reduce the normal rate of development and may lead to a delay in bearing. Trees producing good crops of fruit, no matter of what age, re - quire, however, an annual winter pruning. This is particularly true in all such instances where too many branches have been left during </seg>
            <seg id="p534">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE the formative period of development. Judicious pruning will reduce competition among the branches for the available food supply, result - ing in better foliage, larger and brighter fruit and increased vigor and grower. Soil fertilization is above all things a factor of paramount im - portance In the maintenance of vigor in the apple tree. When the orchard Is planted on a naturally rich soil, like the deep loess along the Missouri and Mississippi rivers, little difficulty will be experienced in maintaining a high degree of fertility! Poor sandy soils have to be enriched regularly and systematically. There is no better fertilizer for apple trees than stable manure, but it is becoming scarce and expensive. Orchard soils may be im - proved readily and cheaply by growing an adaptable legume as a cover crop. Leguminous crops are most desirable since they will add to the soil, not only organic matter, but also nitrogen, which they secure from the air. Sweet and red clover, vetch, cowpeas and soybeans are very valuable cover crops in the mid western states. Most cover crops are sown early in the fall and turned under in the spring. Hence they are often referred to as "green manure" crops. As a result of this practice, organic matter will be incorporated into the soil where bacteria will utilize the carbon as a source of energy for release of additional nitrogen. Clean cultivation is Usually maintained till the next crop is seeded in July or August. This practice will help to conserve soil moisture during the summer months, when it is most needed and very often Insufficient. Soils in many orchards perforce have to be kept In sod or a permanent cover crop as a protection against excessive erosion or to facilitate spraying and other orchard operations. In the making of. a sod, leguminous plants, for instance some of the clovers, may be of great value. Permanent cover crops, as a rule, should not be cut for hay, but mulched. On most soils apple trees, especially when bearing heavily, can - not be maintained in a vigorous condition by cover cropping, unless it be very successfully managed. It Is almost impossible on the poorer soils with a thick sod of grass. Nitrogen Is commonly the limiting factor in such orchards, while phosphorus may be beneficial for cer - tain soils to maintain a good cover crop. Of the many nitrogenous fertilizers on the market, nitrate of soda and sulphate of ammonia have gained the greatest popularity. Under ordinary circumstances there is no choice between the two. It should be remembered, however, that nitrate of soda contains about 16% nitrogen and sulphate of ammonia 20%. Therefore only three - fourths as much of sulphate as nitrate should be used. There is some evidence that the sulphate is somewhat slower in its action than the nitrate and hence It should be applied a few days earlier. For soils that are strongly add, nitrate or soda should be used, but when lime </seg>
            <seg id="p535">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY is applied to counteract acidity, sulphate of ammonia may be pre - ferred. Many other forms of commercial fertilizers containing pri - marily nitrogen have been put on the market, such as calcium nitrate, calcium cyanamlde, urea, calurea, zeunasaltpeter, 1 etc., but their com - parative value for the fertilization of fruit trees has not yet been definitely ascertained. Undoubtedly some of these synthetic products will be widely used by orchardists in the future. The amount of fertilizer to be applied is determined by the con - dition of the tree. Young trees with sparce yellowish foliage and thin short branches may be just as much in need of nitrogen as older bearing trees. It will be a surprise to many a fruit grower who will try It how devitalized trees, say 3-5 years old, will respond to a spring application of three-fourths of a pound of nitrate of soda or half a pound of ammonium sulphate. Growth will be stimulated, the leaves will be larger and of a deep green color and In general the trees will show a marked increase in vigor and will become hardier and more resistant to disease. A word of caution may be In place here. Young trees before they have reached the bearing age should not be overstlmulated with readily available nitrogenous fertilizers. This may delay their com - ing into bearing by overbalancing the relationship between the carbo - hydrate and nitrogen content in the tree. But once the tree has begun to bear good crops, there Is much lesa danger of such an upset, for a large amount of nitrogen is required for the development of the fruit. In most orchards the bearing apple trees will respond con - spicuously to spring application of nitrogen. The amount to be used depends on the condition of the trees and their age. Devitalized trees naturally will require more nitrogen than those! growing vigorously. Under most circumstances one-fourth pound of nitrate of soda or an equivalent amount of sulphate of ammonia for every year's age of the tree is about the right quantity. Thus the smaller, more back - ward trees, which need the most stimulation, will get their share, despite the fact that they may not bear quite as much fruit. The fertilizer is broadcast as far or a little farther than the reach of the branches. Care should be exercised not to throw it too dose to the main stem. To maintain vigor and productivity in apple trees that have ac - quired a biennial bearing habit, a somewhat different program may be advisable. If such trees are fertilized with nitrogen in the bear - ing or "on" year then, as a result of the Increased set, they will bo exhaust themselves that they will not be able to recuperate during the ensuing "off" year. Protracted investigations at the Missouri Agricultural Experiment Station have shown that it is advisable to apply nitrogenous fertilizers to biennial bearing apples, like the York, in the spring and the fall of the off year only. This will help to </seg>
            <seg id="p536">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE preserve vigor and to some extent reduce the tendency to bear every alternate year. Biennial bearing trees that have become very de - vitalized because of age or orchard crowding will be still further stimulated by a moderately heavy pruning during the winter follow - ing a crop. Such; a combined program of fertilization and pruning may help to maintain vigor and break the biennial bearing habit of some apple varieties. Question': How much growth should bearing apples make each year? Dr. M. : About 12 to 15 inches, sometimes more. Question: Do you consider sulphate of ammonia just as valuable a fertilizer as nitrate of soda? Dr. M. : Yes. For all general purposes the two are alike when used in equivalent amounts. Question: Is hairy vetch a good cover crop for most orchards in this part of the country? Dr. M. : It is, for it will grow later in the fall and start earlier in the spring than most cover crops. The seed is not very expensive -. and it will reseed itself when properly managed. It is a legume and absorbs nitrogen from the air. THE HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE MEETING AT DES MOINES By E. H. HOPPERT. Horticultural research workers from the United States and Canada gathered at Des Molnes, December 30, 31 and January 1 to report on the progress of their experiments. It will be impossible to give in detail the results of all of the papers presented, in fact some of the work would have no application for this section of the country. There - fore I will give a brief summary of those papers that pertained to fruit crops which we grow and try to adapt the information to our conditions. ; Pollination Studies That there is a great Interest in the part that pollination plays in apple growing is indicated by the fact that seven papers were pre - sented on this subject alone. They represent work on in five different states. Dr. A. E. Murneek of Missouri University was one of the speakers and he has gone into the problem in considerable detail, telling you of the work done and results secured in Missouri. It might be of interest, however, to tell you something about the experi - ments of New York and Illinois workers. L. H, MacDaniels working with Mcjntosh in the Lake Champiain district in New York State </seg>
            <seg id="p537">Nebraska state horticultural society found that if the weather conditions are very favorable for pollina - tion even a so-called self sterile variety like Mclntosh may produce fruit on 20-30% of the spurs having blossoms and this would result in a fair crop of fruit. Under very unfavorable pollinating conditions this la not the case of course. Furthermore, when the conditions are favorable for pollination and good pollinating varieties are properly located and bees are used, the set may be too heavy for the good of the crop. In other words, over-pollination mayi cause a very heavy early set followed by an excessive June drop and a final light set. M. J. Dorsey of the Illinois Station reported that the genetic makeup of the ovules in Black Twig, Winesap and Stayman is in - fluenced by the growth and vigor of the tree. For example, the ovules of flowers on trees lacking in vigor will contain as few as 8 chromo - somes whereas on vigorous trees the normal number is 20. No matter whether conditions are favorable for cross pollination or whether the trees are given a nitrogen fertilizer the following spring, the set of fruit will be light. The point here is that certain varieties are likely to produce flowers that are underdeveloped when lacking in vigor, and these cannot produce fruits. Here the remedy lies in more vigor - ous growth and more perfectly developed flower parts. Then with good pollinating conditions the trees can give a good account of them - selves. ' ■ Commercial Fertilizers in Fruit Growing The feeding of fruit plants plays a very important part in fruit growing. Of the 64 papers presented at the Horticultural Science meetings, treating of fruit growing, fifteen had to do with the use of fertilizers. In general the only element that gave any increased yields, was some form of nitrogen. Potash and phosphorus fertilizers gave no response except at one place In Illinois where potash gave some - what higher yields than where nitrates were used alone. In several states work was done to determine whether the use of nitrates affected the storage or shipping qualities of the fruit. In Maryland for example, apple buyers discriminated against fruit that was produced from trees fertilized with nitrates. Internal breakdown was supposed to be caused by nitrates. In Ohio, Washington and Maryland careful experiments showed that in general this is not the case when the trees are carrying a good crop. When, however, the trees have a very light crop, the- tendency is for overgrown fruits when usually ripen prematurely, to have breakdown. The applica - tion of nitrates may In a case like this aggravate the situation by forcing the fruit still more. Dr. A. E. Murneek of Missouri told of an experiment carried on 'at Missouri with York Imperial in which an attempt was made to make this variety produce annual crops. He has; told us more of this in our meetings here at Lincoln so there is no need to dwell upon this matter. </seg>
            <seg id="p538">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD Of AGRICULTURE In Maryland and Michigan the experiment station men have found that, fall applications of nitrate give far better results on cherries and apples than spring applications. The fruit buds on fall nitrated trees look larger and more vigorous than those with spring applications and the yields are greater. The application may be made after the first of September though It is usually made about the middle of September. In these trials one plat was fertilized in early August. In one case a- heavy rain washed the nitrate into the soil immediately and injury resulted by inducing late fall growth. In Washington the nitrate is placed in the irrigation ditches in the Orchard at the last irrigation in the fall. Here spring applications would be of little value because irrigation is not practiced early in the spring and rains could not be depended upon to wash the fer - tilizer into the soil. In the pruning of grapes it has been found in Minnesota that Beta will produce greater yields when more than the usual 50 or 60 buds are left. The proper amount is approximately 85 buds. In this case the bunches average slightly smaller . but since Beta is not a table grape the size of the individual bunch is of no particular con - sequence. In Illinois A. 9. Colby found that a larger crop of grapes is produced where a 3-wire trellis is used than where the grapes are &lt; trained on only two wires. THE ORIENTAL PEACH MOTH The lot of the fruit grower is becoming more difficult year by year. Insects and diseases of many kinds are already present in his orchards. And now comes a new one that threatens his business. This time it is one that was brought in from Japan back in 1913. It is called the oriental fruit moth or the oriental peach moth. It has become one of the worst pests of the peach in New Jersey, Mary - land, Virginia, Ohio, Indiana and Illinois. The reason I am men - tioning it at this time is because it will undoubtedly become a pest in Nebraska before many years. In fact it may be here right now, because many car loads of peaches and early apples come into our state each year from southern Illinois where this insect has become firmly established. Last season many orchardists in Union and Pulaski counties reported that from 85 to 95% of their peaches were ruined by this insect. Furthermore ordinary control measures such_ as are used for curcullo and codling moth are of no avail with this pest. Lead- arsenate sprays seem to do no good whatever because the insect spits out the first few mouthfuls in burrowing into the twigs or fruit. Furthermore, there are from 4 to 5 broods of worms to contend with and the Insect will attack all of the stone fruits and </seg>
            <seg id="p539">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOClETV in addition apples and pears. But not only does It attack the fruits and leaves. It burrows into the soft succulent shoots as well. For these reasons it is well that the grower acquaint himself with the insect and learn something about its control. The adult moth is about the size of the codling moth and very much like it in color and habits. It flies at dusk and dawn and Is attracted by moth traps. The female lays from 40 to 100 eggs that hatch in about 10 days. The overwintering form , is the larva which is round in a white cocoon on the trunk of the tree close to the ground and also in the ground within 2 or 3 Inches of the surface. When the eggs hatch the young larvae feed on the stems and shoots and enter these if succulent and they may mature there provided the shoots do not become too hard. The fruit is frequently entered, then the stem, so that it is difficult to detect the wormy peaches after picking because there may be no visible hole. The larva or worm feeds in the fruit for about ten days and then leaves the fruit to find a hiding place where it spins its cocoon and in 10 to 14 days it has changed to the moth or adult form. By studying the overwintering larvae It has been found that about 7 5% live over in the soil under the tree near where the infested peaches dropped and that most of those that came out of - the fruit crawled to within 6 inches of the ground before spinning their cocoons. The larvae look very much like a codling moth worm, perhaps a little longer, but pink in color with a black head. When an infested peach is cut open the worm squirms around quickly, looking for a hiding place. In this it differs greatly from the curculio grub which is fatter and shorter and very ! sluggish in its actions. Control Measures — Nicotine Sprays I ■ As already suggested the arsenical sprays are of no great value in controlling this pest. Nicotine sprays are quite effective but very expensive, because they must be applied about 6 or 7 times during the season. ■ Most growers in the badly infested regions in the east I have not adopted this means of control on account of the cost. Hydrated Idme Sprays Dr. L. A. Stearns stationed at Iron ton, in the southern Ohio • peach region, found that hydrated lime held great promise in con - j trolling this insect. Where 100 pounds were used in 200 gallons of { water about 90% of the fruit was sound and less than half as many j twigs were injured in young orchards than where this material was ] not used. j In southern Illinois similar results were found this past season. ' The plats showing up best were those in which hydrated lime was ' combined .with a summer soil such as Verdol and used either as a ', dust or mixed with water and used as a spray. The percentage of 18 </seg>
            <seg id="p540">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE clean fruit In these two plate ran above 85% where adjoining un - sprayed plats ran 95%. -wormy. Unfortunately It was Impossible for the Secretary to make the trip Into this region until after the. fruit was harvested. But In talk - ing with Mr. Chandler, one of the field men for the department doing the work on oriental fruit moth in Illinois, the above facts were learned. The region that was visited, namely the region around Centralla, had not become seriously infested as yet. Mr. Chandler was making a survey in this territory Just before the harvest began and he found an infestation of about 2%. This, he said, would In - crease to 15% next year if previous experiences and surveys were a fair indication. He also stated that the infestation became worse where early and late varieties were used together or where peaches and apples were inter planted. The reason for this is that after the early peaches are harvested the later broods find favorable conditions for multiply - ing in the later fruits. It has also been found that if young trees are fertilized and late luxuriant growth promoted, the injury 1b much more severe. Evidently the new shoots are not suitable for this pur - pose when they have hardened up. It has beea found that the regular fall application of paradi - chlorabenzene to the base of peach trees will kill a large proportion of overwintering larvae. Thorough cultivation by disking early in the spring will likewise destroy the larvae in the ground. These two methods should account for about 80% of the overwintering larvae according to Dr. Stearns. One other redeeming feature in the fight on the oriental fruit moth is the fact that a great many parasites work on it. About 40 different species have been found which help to control it and most of these work on the larvae. In fact it has been found that in those regions where the infestation was very heavy at first, only about 15 or 20% of the fruit is affected at present, even though no new spraying methods are used. Evidently nature has provided a very good check in this case. The unfortunate part of this feature is that the orchard owner may be bankrupt before the parasites become numerous enough to be of any real value. </seg>
            <seg id="p541">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY ■ THURSDAY MORNING SESSION JANUARY 9, 1930 THE PRESIDENT: The meeting is called to order. First we will hear the report of the Resolutions Committee appointed yesterday. MR. HOPPERT: I beg to present the following resolution: WHEREAS, it has pleased the will of the Almighty God to take from our midst Clyde H. Barnard of Table Rock, a member of this Society almost from its inception and active in its affairs as Secretary from 1901 to 1904. therefore be it RESOLVED, That we gratefully remember his valuable services to our Society and his interest In the upbuilding of the horticulture of Nebraska. As death takes from among us one after another of our fellow members and co-workers in the field of horticulture we can but mourn for them as brothers, who have toiled with us, and whose memories we will ever cherish. Signed: E. H. HOPPERT, GEORGE CHRISTY, LOY FRANKLIN. THE PRESIDENT: You have heard the resolution presented by your committee. All those In favor of this resolution respond by say - ing "Aye." The resolution is adopted. We will proceed then with the next number on our program. Dr. J. P. Williams of Lincoln has been the owner of a cherry orchard in Northport, Michigan, since 1910. Each summer he leaves his work here in Lincoln to look after his holdings in northern Michigan. And he has made a success of his orchard, too. It Isn't merely a hobby. I am sorry there aren't more of our cherry growers in to hear him. The storm and snow evidently has kept many who were planning to be here from coming. I am sure that those who have braved the weather will feel well repaid by what Dr. Williams has to tell them. It is a pleasure to introduce to you Dr. Williams. GROWING SOUR CHERRIES IN NORTHERN MICHIGAN DR. J. P. WILLIAMS. Lincoln, Nebraska It is a pleasure for me, I assure you, to talk before a group of those Interested in fruit growing. I ' don't know whether the experiences I have had in Michigan will be of any direct benefit to you here. Our conditions at Northport are entirely different </seg>
            <seg id="p542">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE than they are here in Nebraska. My orchard is situated on a penin - sula jutting out into Lake Michigan about 400 miles north of Chicago. This peninsula Is almost entirely surrounded by water, many miles of it, and it is deep, too, from 40 to 150 feet deep. Because of this water we can grow things that they would not think of growing at Chicago or at Benton Harbor, for example, which Is on the west shore of Lake Michigan just across the lake from Chicago. Because the winds in this section come for the greater part of the season across this large body of water our climate is very mild and not only mild but very uniform. There are no sudden changes in temperature such as you have here. Anyone who has been in Northport a whole winter will appreciate the fact that the water has a beneficial effect on temperatures and humidity. In spite of the fact that Northport is as far north as the Twin Cities in Minnesota the lowest temperature recorded in Northport in years was 13 below zero, and such low temperatures are unusual. In fact, seldom, does the temperature go below zero during the winter. I have been keeping a recording thermometer on my back porch at the orchard for a num - ber of years and I have the records to show for this statement. We seldom have weather that will injure sweet cherries and you know that this species can't be grown successfully even this far south. Another thing in this connection that might interest you is that spring frosts are seldom known there. The ice from Lake Michigan is piled up on the shore sometimes 40 to 50 feet high and the winds blowing over this mountain of ice are cooled down in the spring and serve to hold our trees back. Of course that delays the ripening of the cherries. Our ' Montmorency cherries are usually harvested in August and I have known them to remain on the trees until the latter part of September. The first killing frost usually is held back oh account of the effect of the water. I have known of tomatoes being picked as late as Thanksgiving day. So much for the climate. The soil is probably not as good as it is here. It is mostly of a sandy nature. We have to use fertilizers freely. Labor for harvesting the cherry crop is plentiful. We .are in a great summer resort section and we also have an Indian reservation to draw from. Furthermore our season of harvesting is so late that the regions to the south have discharged their help and we can get these if needed. Selecting a Site ' ■ .' i - ■ The best orchard, sites are those that are fairly high. Pockets are to be avoided because the trees seldom are productive. I have one place that is low, without good air and soil drainage. This part has never produced good crops on the lower parts. In recent years we have been pruning off the lower branches and forcing the trees higher up and they are producing better, </seg>
            <seg id="p543">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY We have a lot of wind in our section, much more than here. The quality of the cherries are greatly injured if they are bruised and the pack (in the can) does not look attractive, the bruised places showing up black. To avoid damage from wind we have set out sweet cherries as a windbreak. The trees grow fast and will yield something for the care they require and the space they occupy! We find that where the orchards are on high ground and exposed to the prevailing winds the quality is lowered unless we plant windbreaks. Montmorency is Best Variety. The one best, most profitable variety is Montmorency. It pro - duces the finest kind of fruit and lots of it. Early Richmond is not so good and the English Morella still poorer. Planting We plant one-year-old trees and space them 2 0 feet on the diag - onal. The planting Is done in the fall and the young trees are pruned to the modified leader type just as soon as the buds begin to grow in the spring. We find that pruning at setting time is not satisfac - tory because one can't tell definitely which buds will grow, then. After the trees are started with the scaffold branches well dis - tributed, then the pruning is practically omitted until the trees are well in bearing and then only the dead branches are taken out and thinned out in the center. We find that the pickers will not harvest the cherries where the picking is slow like in the center and where there is much dead wood, so we take out these parts in order to pro - duce the cherries where they are easily harvested and where we get our best fruit. When we find a tree that has been injured from some cause or . other and the leaves begin to shrivel we cut back about half of the new wood. We find that this relieves the tree of excess fruit and leaves and they are much more apt to recover. Fertilizers are used regularly. Even the young trees are given some, usually ih the second year, and about one-fourth pound. The principal thing used is ammonium sulphate. As the trees become older more is given. About 4 to 5 pounds is used on our old bearing trees. The weaker growing trees are given special doses In the growing season. The application is made usually about a month before the blooming period. The application is made shortly after the sticky bands are applied for the climbing cut worms. | At first some of the growers took no measures for the control of this insect and it has become well established. It will climb the trees at night and feeds heavily on fruit buds. The sticky bands will prevent damage. Another insect that has become established Is the cherry maggot. This insect in its adult form 1b a fly. It lays eggs on the fruit after Rcrdping off a little of the skin. This at present is the most serious </seg>
            <seg id="p544">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE peat we have to deal with. There may be 8 or 10 maggots in a cherry. Naturally fruits with maggots in them are of little value and if such fruit is canned the product is very likely condemned as unfit for human food. You can see how a serious outbreak of this insect can hamper the industry. The Extension men of the College of Agricul - ture at East Lansing have been informing the growers when to apply lead arsenate to the trees to control this pest. Usually it comes just as the cherries begin turning color. We have been using a dusting machine for applying the arsenate of lead and found it quick and effective for this pest. The curculio is serious, too, if not controlled, but where the early lead arsenate sprays are applied there is comparatively little trouble from this pest. Shot hole fungus has been a serious matter in our section only a few times. During the past season it was very bad in a few orchards. A peculiar thing happened in this outbreak. It seemed to follow in a definite streak like a hall storm and it affected all orchards in the streak. Other orchards outside the streak were not affected with shot hole even though unsprayed. In the affected region orchards were hit hard even though sprayed eight times. My orchard happened to be right at the edge of the streak and only a small part was affected. The materials we are using now is lime surphur solution, of which we use a gallon and a quarter to fifty gallons of water. Bordeaux, we think, controls the disease a little better but it causes a dwarfing of the fruit. Therefore Bordeaux is never used on the older trees that are In bearing but we use it on young trees that have no fruit. We start spraying as soon as the petals fall and spray about every ten days until two weeks before harvest time. Some growers spray again after harvest, but . I have always felt that if the trees are in good foliage until harvest time the fruit buds for the next year are good and vigorous and there is little use for further spraying. Harvesting The cherries are picked in heavy tin buckets holding about four quarts. Each picker gets two buckets and is assigned to a certain tree. He is also given a ladder. When he has filled his buckets he brings them to a movable shed where the checker pays him in tokens for his two bucketfuls. These tokens are used like money. The stores and banks accept them as such. We find this method better than cards that are punched and the pickers are better satisfied. The cherries are dumped from these palls into lug boxes, the under grades being sorted out. The lug boxes are collected and taken to the canning plant where each load is graded. About a hundred cherries are taken from different parts of the load at random and graded. . The orchard owner Is paid on the basis of grade. Last year perfect fruit brought 7 % cents a pound. I averaged 7 % cents a </seg>
            <seg id="p545">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY pound. The reason my grade came down somewhat was because a part of my orchard is exposed to heavy winds which bruise the cherries considerably. There is one point regarding the picking which might interest you. In each of these sheds that receives the cherries from the pickers we have several 5-gallon milk cans with faucets attached as drinking fountains. These cans are placed in wet sawdust and we find that the drinking water is kept very cool in this way. Furthermore the pickers like the method because they lose no time because when they bring in their buckets they can get a cool drink at the same time. QUESTION: What do you have Vm pay for picking? DR. WILLIAMS: One cent a pound. QUESTION: Are the cherries picked without their stems. ANSWER: Yes. The buyer doesn't want the stems and in fact will dock in price if the stems are left on. QUESTION: How are the cherries put up? ANSWER: Most of them are cold packed, that is, washed and sorted and poured in paraflned barrels with some sugar and frozen at 28 below zero. Then they are kept in a room held at 15 below zero. . • QUESTION: Won't the cherries taste of the wood when they are removed? We are putting them up in 5-gallon tin cans in the Spokane section. ANSWER: Evidently there are no complaints of this sort or they would not place them in" this' type of container. Of course some cherries are put in tin cans, but quite a large number of pie bakers use the cherries frozen In barrels. In fact the quality put up by the independent packer in our section is so good that there has been no difficulty in this connection. THE PRESIDENT: We are certainly thankful to Dr. Williams for his splendid talk. Are there any other questions that you care to ask Dr. Williams? If not we will proceed with our program. The next number oh our program is "The Why and How of Fruit Washing," by Mr. Win. Ablldgaard. Mr. Abildgaard has followed the development of fruit washing in the Pacific Northwest. He has helped install a great many Bean Fruit Washers and he knows the problems confronting the growers. I take great pleasure in introduc - ing Mr. Abildgaard. </seg>
            <seg id="p546">REPORT OF NEBRASKA StATE BOARD OF AGRIClrt.TURfi THE WHY AND HOW OF FRUIT WASHING I By WM. ABILDGAARD, Sales Manager, . John Bean Mfg. Co., Lansing, Michigan. Most growers and shippers have now become accustomed to the fact that spray residue must be removed from fruit. Not only is this a government 1 requirement, but the process so Improves the appear - ance of the fruit that it commands a higher market value. Growers and packers who have had to wash their fruit to meet the required tolerance will tell you that were the tolerance to be removed tomorrow they would still continue to wash. I well remember the hectic times in the Pacific Northwest during the fall of 1926. Growers had been advised that their fruit contained entirely too much spray residue and that the old law giving a toler - ance of .01 would be enforced. At first it seemed impossible to meet this tolerance and a great many figured that when harvest time came the government would realize how impossible it was and would not enforce the tolerance. Several manufacturers thought otherwise and developed machinery for wiping the fruit, but very few sales were made until California and the Rogue River Valley of Oregon started shipping Bartlett pears and then real trouble developed because the government did enforce the tolerance and as a result hundreds of tons of California and Oregon pears rotted under the trees, while the growers argued with the government agents. They were finally brought to the realization that it was simply impossible to prepare to meet the tolerance on such short notice and the inspectors were then instructed to pass all fruit for domestic consumption which showed signs of some attempt having been made to remove the excess spray residue. For export shipment, however, they still insisted on the tolerance of .01. This agreement was reached in time to save the apple growers and most of the winter pears, but the Bartlett pear growers certainly took a terrible loss. The manufacturers who were building wiping machines worked day and night trying to supply the demand, but it was absolutely im- , possible and many growers fixed up home-made machines to the best of their ability, while others had to wipe their entire crop by hand. ; The Oregon Agricultural College got real busy early In the game and soon discovered that the wiping machines were entirely too rough in the handling of pears and some varieties of apples, and further - more, that they were of little, if any, value so far as the actual removal of spray residue was concerned. They did a good Job of polishing the apple, but unless the brushes or rags, depending upon what type of machine was used, were removed every hour or two and clean brushes or rags substituted as much residue would be deposited </seg>
            <seg id="p547">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY in the calyx and stem end, as was originally on the entire surface of the apple. Growers who had their fruit tested were also finding the same thing and I have never seen a more j discouraged and dis - heartened group of fruit growers in my life than the one attending the Washington State Horticultural Society's meeting the latter part of December, 1926. However; a very pleasant surprise was waiting for them in the form of a talk by Professor . Henry Hartman of the Oregon Agricul - tural College, to whom I give more credit for the development of fruit cleaning apparatus than any other one man in the world. Hartman and his associates, after finding that wipers were en - tirely out of the question, commenced experiments with washing fruit with a number of different chemicals. At the same time he was plac - ing both in common and cold storage fruit that had been wiped, as well as fruit that had been washed with all of the different chemicals tried and by the latter part of December his experiments had shown that there was absolutely no question but what the only practical method was to wash the fruit with hydro-chloric add and this is now the standard method for the removal of spray residue from apples and pears. During the past year at least 85% of the tonnage of those fruits grown in the Pacific Northwest were successfully washed with hydro - chloric acid. The cost of washing ranges from one to two cents per bushel. Contrary to the opinion of many washing is simple in both theory and practice. Most anyone who is willing to follow a few simple pre - cautions can wash fruit successfully. Although washing can be done in crude wooden vats or tanks, the most satisfactory results are obtained with machines designed for the purpose. Most of the machines now on the market are quite satisfactory and the manufacturers have spent a great deal of money developing -practical machines. In some cases the manufacturers must go through at least three or four selling seasons' before they can make sufficient profit to cover the costs of engineering, development and experimental work. Machines to meet the needs of small orchardists, as well as those of the large commercial concerns, can now be ob - . tained at very reasonable prices. Although many solvents or cleansing agents have been tried — none have proved superior to weak solutions of hydro-chloric acid. This compound can be used with equal success on both apples and pears. It removes such forms of spray residue as arsenic, lead, copper and lime, without injury to the natural wax or protective covering of the fruit. Commercial hydro-chloric acid available Ifor the treatment of fruit cap be obtained from any wholesale or retail dealer in heavy </seg>

After dilution to the proper strength for wash - ing it is not annoying to workers, but may still attack metal and clothing. It does not attack wood, glass or rubber and can always be handled in containers . made of these materials. Metal where thoroughly coated with wax, varnish, pitch or asphaltum paint will resist the action of weak add solutions for a considerable period of time. The washing solution or acid bath for the treatment of fruit is prepared by adding small quantities of commercial hydro-chloric acid to water, the amount of acid varying somewhat with the amount of residue present, the amount of wax that has formed on the surface of the fruit and the type of washing machine used. Under ordinary conditions from 5 to 7 quarts of concentrated acid to 100 gallons of water are sufficient. LAte In the season it Is somewhat necessary to increase the concentration to 10 or 12 quarts per 100 gallons of water. To avoid contamination from decay organisms and possible injury from the accumulation of soluble arsenic in the solution, it is advis - able to change the acid bath daily. The success of washing operations depends largely on the method of applying the washing solution to the fruit. With the successful types of machines the fruit is subjected to either a diffused spray or a flood wash. The so-called "deep submersion" types of machines, wherein the fruit is forced beneath the surface of the water, have proven to be very unsatisfactory! With these machines the pressure of the liquid is sufficient to force the washing solution into the calyx tube or even into the center of the fruit, if the calyx tube extends into the core region. Effective rinsing is impossible in such cases and calyx or core decay may follow. The amount of treatment necessary to thoroughly clean the fruit varies considerably with the type of machine used. In the case of machines employing either the diffused spray or flood-wash principles a treatment of 30 to 50 seconds is usually sufficient. With machines of the floatation type' or submersion type, however, where no great amount of agitation is provided, from 4 to 5 minutes of treatment are often required. Thorough rinsing following the add treatment is very necessary. The acid must be thoroughly removed if injury is to be avoided. To insure proper rinsing agitation of the water is necessary. A mere plunge into still water does not insure thorough rinsing. Dependable results are only obtained when the rinsing water is either sprayed or thrown upon the fruit. A spray of clean water as the fruit leaves the machine is by far the most efficient system and will also remove Bucb decay-producing spores as may still be .attached to the fruit. </seg>
            <seg id="p549">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY The effectiveness of rinsing is generally determined by applying the tongue to the calyx end of the fruit. A sharp, biting sensation is experienced when the acid has not all been removed. Hydrated lime is sometimes used in the rinse water, especially when water for rinsing is not available in abundance. Hydrated lime neutralizes hydro-chloric acid, as well as arsenic acid and other forms of soluble arsenic that might be injurious if left on the fruit. In addition, lime seems to possess fungicldal properties against blue mold and other forms of decay organisms. One to two pounds -of hydrated lime per 100 gallons of rinse water are generally used. Small quantities of lime left on the fruit are not injurious, but are often mistaken for arsenate of lead. If it can be arranged to have about 8 or 10 gallons of water per minute flowing through the rinse tank It will not be necessary to use lime and the fruit will then have a much better appearance. Drying of the fruit after it 1b washed has been accomplished in several ways. The most efficient washing machines are equipped with blowers that blow the water from the surface of the fruit, while othem are equipped with towel drapers that are kepi, dry by being passed through wringers which remove the moisture by absorption. In some cases the small growers have merely' stacked the fruit in boxes, per - mitting it to dry by natural means, but this is not considered good practice. When the spray residue has been thoroughly removed, when rins - ing has been' done properly and a fairly good job of drying done no injury has occurred that could be attributed either to water or the hydro-chloric acid. Experiences have demonstrated that it is best to wash the fruit immediately after harvest. In the cases of apples, wax on the surface of the fruit develops rapidly after picking and may interfere with the action of the solvents on the deposits of spray residue. Drying condi - tions are usually more favorable early in the ! season. There is less likelihood of contamination from decay organisms if the fruit is washed while it is still in a good physical condition. There is also less possibility of mechanical injury and fruit washed at picking time usually presents a more attractive appearance than that washed after wax development has occurred. In summing up I want to assure you that the washing of fruit for the removal of spray residue is not nearly so serious a problem as was at first believed and that if reasonable care is practiced there positively will not be any damage to the fruit from the washing opera - tions or use of hydro-chloric acid. Some of the first fruit washers built, which were of the sub - mersion ty"pe, forced the acid through the calyx and into the core of the apple, which did cause considerable damage, but there has never </seg>

As a rule, more flowers are shed than remain on the •Taken from "Fruits and Gardens" Magazine. </seg>
            <seg id="p551">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY tree to form the crop. Much of the bloom Is lost soon after petals Tall, and a large number of partially developed fruits are thrown off during the next few weeks. The June drop, which generally occurs about six to eight weeks after the period of bloom, marks the end of this period of wholesale shedding. The elimination of the superfluous flowers and young fruits is by no means undesirable. If too large a proportion of flowers remain attached to the trees, the fruits are likely to be undersized and of poor color. Furthermore, a heavy set may leave the trees in a weak - ened condition which renders them very subject to winter injury. Over-production may also be responsible, in part at least, for the habit of alternate bearing of many varieties. On the other hand, it sometimes happens that there 1b an abund - ance of bloom year after year, but little or no fruit is harvested. This failure of flowers to set in sufficient numbers constitutes one of the most serious problems of the fruit production and is responsible for heavy losses to many growers. It is Important to remember that the blossoms of our fruit plants are very delicate and highly specialized structures which exist, as such, only a short time. Unless the blossoms 'are rejuvenated and stimulated to a further growth shortly after petals expand, they soon degenerate, become inactive, and are soon shed from the tree. The shedding of flowers and fruits that fail to make a lively growth Is entirely normal and is comparable, in many respects, to the shedding of leaves in the autumn. Provisions for removing the Inactive fruiting structure are found in a thin plate of tissue located at" the base of the stem. The cells of this tissue have the ability to alter their adhesive properties and thus cause the loss of the entire structure beyond the zone of separa - tion. This special function of separation, or abscission, is easily brought into play not only at blossoming time but throughout the early stages of fruit development. After the June drop, however, the connecting tissues are given added strength j and the cells at the base of the fruit stems do not respond so readily to conditions that previously caused them to separate from one another. Proper Pollination Needed From the point of view of the grower, pollination may be re - garded as an essential step In keeping the flower attached to the tree by stimulating growth and starting the development of fruit. The importance of proper pollination for the set of fruit has been emphasized repeatedly at Growers' meetings and in the horticultural press. It will be recalled that the process of pollination Involves, first of all, the transfer of the pollen grains from the stamen to the pistil. This work la done mainly by Insects, especially bees. Each bee may carry many thousand grains of pollen on its body and Is an </seg>
            <seg id="p552">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE efficient worker when the weather permits. After the pollen reaches the stigma it germinates and forms a tube which extends to the egg or seed cavity. So far as the plant is concerned, the final result of the pollination process is attained when the contents of pollen grains are fused with the contents of the egg cells. This fusion, as you know, is called fertilization, and it is an essential step in seed formation. Satisfactory pollination, as judged by the resulting crop, is secured in many orchards containing but one variety. This Is true in many large blocks of Baldwin, York Imperial, Jonathan and other sorts which usually produce well with their own pollen when the bloom is good. Such varieties are spoken ot as self-fruitful or self - fertile. In many cases, a larger set of fruit may be obtained when the llowers are cross-pollinated, that is when they receive pollen from another variety of the same fruit. The large set that usually results from cross-pollination may not be always desirable since many varie - ties under good growing conditions set as much fruit with their own pollen as the tree can properly mature. There are- some varieties, however, such as the Rhode Island Greening, Mcln tosh, Delicious, Stayman Winesap and several others, for which cross-pollination seems essential for the best of results. The behavior of fruits with respect to the need for cross-pollina - tion is not necessarily a clear cut variety characteristic, and It is certainly not consistent. Young trees of Mclntosh, for example, some - times set fruit of their own pollen, but as they grow older the greater stimulation of cross-pollination seems to be necessary for the best results. A given variety may be listed as self-fruitful In one locality and under certain soil conditions, -but may require cross-pollination under other conditions of growth. Baldwin, for example, which ap - parently does well with its own pollen In New York, is reported to require cross-pollination in Ohio. It is Interesting to note that many of the standard varieties of the older orchards such as Baldwin, York Imperial, and Yellow Transparent, are self-fertile to a satisfactory degree, while; some of the newer varieties, such as Mclntosh, Stayman Winesap, and the Delicious, are self-sterile and often fall to set in large blocks, j Varieties chosen to provide the benefits of cross-pollination should be known to be satisfactory for that purpose. They must, of course, bloom at approximately the same time and they should pro - duce an abundance of viable pollen. Varieties such as the Stayman Winesap or Baldwin generally have poor pollen, while Delicious, Olden - burg or Grimes are usually the good pollen producers. We cannot be certain, however, that all varieties which do have an abundance of viable pollen are capable of causing a set on any other variety. It has been definitely established in the case of cherries, for example, that Napoleon, Blng, and Lambert fail to set their own pollen and also when planted adjacent to each other in the same orchard. These varieties, nevertheless, set fruit when properly pollinated by a fourth </seg>
            <seg id="p553">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY variety and they themselvea are capable of causing a set on other than the named varieties. We do not know how general is this con - dition, which is known as cross-incompatabllity, but some evidence indicates that it may exist In other fruits as well as in the sweet cherry. Provisions of cross-pollination must be made with special refer - ence to the years when conditions will be below optimum, when there is only a brief period during which the insects can work. The best distribution of pollen occurs in adjoining trees. In a case where two varieties are to be planted in equal number, a row of one may be alternated with a row of the other sort. Some | prefer to have two or three rows of one variety and then one to three rows of another. In providing pollinators in a solid block, at least one tree in nine should be top-worked to another pollen variety. Distribution of flower-bear - ing branches of a good pollen sort placed- in tubs or water throughout the orchard may be employed as a temporary expedient until the top - worked trees begin to bloom. Competition for Water and Nutrients Between Young Fruit and Lieaves. While pollination is necessary to stimulate activity of the flower and young fruit, continued growth cannot take place unless there is an abundant supply of water and nutrients. If- the growth of young fruits is very greatly retarded at any time before the June drop, the abscission layer which causes shedding will soon form. The young fruits must compete for water and nutrient materials not only with each other but also with the vigorous shoot growth and the rapidly expanding leaves. Fruits that cannot obtain these necessary growth producing substances will fail to maintain their activity and if this occurs during the period, when abscission is easily brought about they will be shed even though they have had the Initial stimulation of cross-pollination. In general, flowers and young fruits have a poorer chance than leaves to obtain the necessary water and nutrients whenever the supply is limited. This can be' demonstrated by the following simple experiment. A ring of bark one-half inch wide is removed from a " branch two inches or more in diameter. The sapwood is then cut with a coarse saw to a depth of one-half inch, after which the ring of bark is replaced and held firmly in its original position by small nails. This is done Just about the time the flowers are opening. In a branch so treated the water from the soil must pass near the center of the stem. Under such a handicap the leaves can obtain enough water and nutri - ents to remain active and to make a fair shoot 'growth, but practically all of the' flowers and young fruits on that branch will be shed. It is evident, therefore, that the fruit cannot obtain water as rapidly as the leaves. </seg>
            <seg id="p554">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE It may seem atrenge to suggest that under natural conditions and when the soil is abundantly supplied with moisture, the heavy drop or the flowers and fruits may, nevertheless, be due to a lack of water for these structures. That this is by no means Impossible becomes apparent when one considers first, that the leaves often transpire water more readily than it can be supplied, and secondly, that the abscission process is easily brought into play by unfavorable condi - tions that may last for only a few hours at a time. Transpiration is. of course, greatly reduced during the night and during cool, cloudy or rainy days. At such times water is stored in both woody and ileshy tissues of the tree from which it is again withdrawn during periods of excessive water loss. While the water needed by the tree must, of course, come from the soil, the actual amount available for the growing fruit depends upon the rate of transpiration of adjoining leaves and also upon the ability of the roots to absorb the water from the soil, and upon tha ability of the trunk and branches to conduct it from the roots to thp various parts of the tree as rapidly as it is lost. Pruning and the Set of Fruit Pruning frequently results in a distinct improvement in the amount of fruit that remains after the June drop. In some experi - ments with the varieties of Mclntosh and Rhode Island Greening, for example, the bearing surface of .fifteen-year-old trees was reduced by one-fourth to one-third without reducing the crop. Varieties such as Delicious are also helped by heavy pruning. In many cases it has been observed that the heavy pruning incident to top-working often helps the set on the remaining branches. Pruning done during the dormant season limits the loss of water in the spring when competition is the most likely to cause the abscis - sion of the flowers and the fruits. This conservation of water is ac - complished by the removal of a large number of buds, each of which ordinarily gives rise to about twenty square inches of foliage which in turn would transpire considerable water. Furthermore, the supply of water to the tissues which remain after pruning may actually be increased since the undisturbed root system capable of supporting the original top will be required to support a smaller initial leaf surface. In pruning, many smaller branches and much weak growth is re - moved, but thte larger limbs and the trunk are usually not disturbed. It is of interest to note that the wood of the trunk and of the large branches, as frell as vigorous growth, offers the least resistance to the flow of water from roots to leaves. While the conducting tissue normally present may bo more than sufficient to allow the water to move to the leaves as rapidly as it can be supplied by the roots, in pruned trees there is an extra margin of safety for the young fruit during the brief periods on clear, hot days when transpiration goes on at an excessive rate. The amount of water held In the trunk will </seg>
            <seg id="p555">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY also be relatively greater for the reduced leaf surface, so that there 1b less danger of Incipient wilting which may bring about the crop of fruit. By reducing the amount of foliage and the fruit-bearing surface, pruning also brings about a better supply of soli nutrients, especially nitrogen, to the remaining top. With less Initial leaf surface, a smaller amount of carbohydrate food Is manufactured and this con - dition, together with a good water and soil nutrient supply, causes invigoration of many growing points. The resulting shoot growth with its many large leaves tends to replace the foliage eliminated by the dormant pruning. Fortunately, however, so far as the fruit set - ting process is concerned, this replacement of foliage requires many weeks and is usually not advanced far enough to offer serious com - petition with fruit for water at the time it easily shed. The leaves on heavily pruned trees may be even more efficient in manufacturing food materials than less vigorous foliage on non-pruned trees, and the fruit benefits accordingly In size and quality. In order to receive the best results from pruning, so far as the set of fruit is concerned, the trees should be in a thrifty condition with an abundance of nitrogen available for vegetative growth. Rela - tively little immediate improvement in the crop Is to be expected when the trees to be pruned are of low vigor. Very young trees which have not yet begun to bloom or which have not yet j attained sufficient size to bear worthwhile crops should, of course, Snot be pruned except where it is necessary to train the branches. Since all the water used by the tree must come from the ground, a good supply of soil moisture is highly desirable for the set of fruit. In New York state a dry soil in the spring is seldom responsible for the inadequate water supply which may cause abscission. In fact, there is often too much rather than too little water at that time of the year. The drouth is more likely to occur after the June drop when it Influences the size of the fruits rather than the set. Cultiva - tion early in the spring tends to conserve moisture by the destruction of weeds, but this operation is Important so far as the set of fruit is concerned primarily because of its Influence on the nitrate supply. This factor will be discussed later. It Is important to remember that an abundance of soil moisture does not necessarily indicate a good supply of {water to the growing tissues of fruits and shoots. Much depends on the activity of the root system and its function in absorbing moisture. Water enters the plant through the delicate root hairs which are In Intimate contact with the minute soil particles. These root hairs, which ordinarily cannot be seen with the naked eye, are produced near the growing point on fibrous roots, which' In turn originate from the larger roots with which we are more familiar. A healthy root system can begin activity early in the spring soon after the frost leaves the ground and </seg>
            <seg id="p556">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE.. several weeks before the buds open. When the soil is warm and well aerated, considerable new growth may be made so that water can be abundantly supplied to the leaves and the flowers when they finally appear. Under such conditions, the chances are good for a satisfac - tory set of fruit, provided, of course, some pollination has been, pos - sible. On the other hand, if the soil stays cold and water logged while the atmosphere is warm, the leaf surface on the trees may develop without a corresponding development of the roots. Thus there would be produced a large amount of transpiring surface which Is dependent upon an inefficient root system to replace the water lost. A heavy drop of fruit is often associated with such unfavorable soil conditions for active root growth. Unfavorable Conditions for Root Activity That Reduce Set Lack of Drainage. Unfortunately, many orchards located on soils which are fairly well drained during average seasons but which fail to provide suitable conditions for the best root growth during years of excessive rain In autumn or early spring. Unless there is a good supply of oxygen the root hairs cannot grow and function normally. The amount of water absorbed is, therefore, limited and not enough may reach the fruit to prevent abscission. If the soil remains water logged and excludes air for a long time, the roots in that region become greatly weakened and finally die. Such shallow root systems are common in the orchards where the water table] during the fall and late winter is close, to the surface. If dry weather should prevail before new roots can be formed to re - place those {killed, the entire tree as well as the fruits may be lost. It should be clearly understood that the full benefits of cross-pollina - tion are not to be expected where the soil conditions are such that the roots cannot do their part in supplying the necessary water and nutrients for. a good set of fruit. Water Injury. On certain soil types many of the smaller, roots are killed by cold during the winter, thus obviously restricting the absorbing surface. While such injury may not immediately influence the vegetative growth, the set of fruit is apt to be reduced by a limited water supply. In some years the low temperature seriously injures or kills the cambium in the main roots near the crown of the tree without; however, killing the smaller roots at lower depths. In such cases water may be absorbed and conducted through the wood to the top of the tree for some time. However, if the bark is not healed over or replaced by bridge-grafting within a few months after the injury occurs, the root will gradually exhaust the stored foods and finally die. A similar result follows girdling by mice or rabbits. A heavy shedding of flowers and fruits on certain of the branches can often be traced to such loss or injury of roots primarily responsl- </seg>
            <seg id="p557">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY ble for supplying water to that portion of the tree. It should be pointed out that the reduction in the set may! occur one or two sea - sons after the original Injury. Ae we shall see later, the immediate results may be an actual improvement in the set. Faulty Cultivation. A rather sudden reduction in the water supply may result from cultivation too close to the trunk. Where the larger main roots are cut the extensive absorbing surface of the fibrous roots farthest from the tree cannot function. Flowing or disk - ing the soil even beyond the spread of the branches may cut off many fine roots found within four to six inches of the surface, but in good soils such rootlets will be only a small part compared with those at lower depths and they are renewed readily. However, where the soil is very shallow or wheje the water table happens to be near the sur - face, too deep cultivation done just about tne blooming time may prove harmful to the set since only a few roots will remain to absorb moisture. Too Close Planting. Given sufficient space, the roots of most fruit plants extend for a considerable distance beyond the branches. In closely planted orchards, however, the root growth is confined to smaller limits and the water absorbing area Is restricted. Thinning the stand of trees by the timely removal of fillers or by cutting out diagonal rows of trees may sometimes result in a very marked im - provement In the set of fruit. SoU Type. The soil type has an important bearing on the growth habits of the root system and greatly Influences its ability to absorb moisture. A well drained, well aerated soil will give up more of its moisture to the tree than a heavier type. The water holding capacity of the soil is largely influenced by the physical, structure and the humus content. The ability of the roots to| obtain this water is greater on the more fertile soils. Even though trees may continue to grow and occasionally produce a crop on poor soil types, the con - ditions are very unfavorable for a set of fruit in many years primarily because the roots cannot function properly. . Nitrogen in Relation to Set Emphasis has thus far been placed on the water supply as one of the factors that influences the set of the fruit, but many nutrients obtained from the soil solutions are also essential for the normal and active growth which prevents abscission. Nitrogen is especially im - portant in this respect and a deficiency of thisj element in the tissue of the tree may often be responsible for a heavy drop of the young fruits. Nitrogen is used in relatively large amounts by the expanding leaves and flowers and as well by the young fruits so that competition may be keen. Part of the nitrogen required may be stored for the season, before the flowers open, in the bark of roots, trunk and in branches near the buds, but in many cases a large proportion of this </seg>
            <seg id="p558">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE . I element must be supplied from the soil in the early spring. The nutrients are taken up by the roots and conditions that restrict root activity will tend to limit the -absorption of nutrients. The amount taken into the plant, however, is not proportional to the water ab - sorbed. Sod Orchards. Trees growing in grass usually lack nitrogen and they frequently show a striking increase in the set of fruit as well as in vegetative growth in response to applications of sodium nitrate or other materials carrying the- element in a readily accessible form. For an example, on a number of branches originating on the unfer - tilized side of I the trees growing in sod there were 326 bower-bearing spurs, 39 of which set fruit; on similar branches arising on the side of the same j trees receiving sodium nitrate . just before bloom 352 flower-bearing spurs set fruits to the number of 126. In some demon - stration orchards the untreated trees in sod produced three bushels of apples each while trees receiving early applications of sodium nitrate produced an average of eleven bushels. In order to produce the desired results, the nitrogen fertilizer must be applied before the flowers open. Some experimental results indicate, however, that caution must be exercised in making heavy applications in very early spring prior to the time foliage appears. During a prolonged period of cool weather the leaves may not expand rapidly enough to utilize the extra nitrogen taken up by the roots. In such cases the excess might result in injury to the flowers, causing the abscission lot the entire cluster. Where there is a heavy sod the amount that is applied should be equivalent to at least two pounds of sodium for each 100 square feet of surface covered, since much nitro - gen will be taken up by the grass and the tree roots will be only what is left. Of course, not all the space between trees need be covered. In a mature tree having a spread of thirty-five feet, at least ten to twelve pounds would be required and this should be spread In a band twelve to fifteen feet from the trunk. If more area is to be covered, the amount must be increased. Smaller trees require less nitrogen in proportion to the spread of the top. Cultivated Orchards. While nitrate applications, are generally necessary on sod, they may also prove beneficial to the set of fruit on trees in cultivated orchards. This will be the case when the soil remains cold and wet late in spring, or if cultivation cannot be done early. Under such conditions the micro-organisms responsible for converting the nitrogenous matter Into a form available to the roots cannot function properly, and as a result the flowers may fail to ob - tain the optimum amount necessary to insure rapid growth and de - ' velopment. A soil which is so low in fertility or so sandy that it does not support a good volunteer crop of weeds will benefit little from cultivation without the addition of nitrate fertilizers. </seg>
            <seg id="p559">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY If cultivation is to supply the nitrogen needed for a good set. the soil type must first of all have a good supply of humus and it should be of such a structure to permit good drainage. Since nitrates do not accumulate until several weeks after the cover crop has been turned over, it is important to plow in late fallj or very early spring. Plowing done after the bloom may help the size of fruit that did stick and possibly bring about an accumulation of nitrogen in the tissue for the following season. The set during the present season, however, cannot be influenced by such late plowing. VjThere cultivation has been done regularly for many years without adding manure or cover crops, the original humus and nitrogen store may be reduced to such an extent that nitrate applications will prove helpful in increasing the crop. As to the specific effects of nitrogen on the process of fruit set - ting, much remains to be learned. It is known that relatively large amounts of this element are needed for active and rapid development of tissues. Under such conditions of rapid growth as we have seen, the abscission layer, responsible for the drop of fruit, Is less likely to form. While more water may actually be transpired by vigorous foliage rich in nitrogen, such succulent leaves are less apt to with - hold or even withdraw water from the flowers or young fruit as pre - viously described. With an abundance of nitrogen, these structures are thus in a better position to compete for the needed water and other growth producing substances. It is of interest to note also that the sapwood laid down under the influence of a good nitrate supply is very efficient in conducting water and seems to favor the rapid movement from roots to leaves. The presence of nitrates in the soil apparently stimulates a more fibrous root growth with correspondingly greater absorbing area. Such a root system is probably more eflttclent in taking the water and nutri - ents from the soil. This is indicated by the fact that in dry seasons trees well supplied with nitrogen will regain in a thrifty condition even though the soil moisture content may be reduced to below that found under trees receiving little or no nitrates. All of these effects of nitrogen on growth relationship tend to help the set and develop - ment of fruit. In addition to water and soil nutrients, the ' developing fruits require large amounts of carbohydrates and other food manufactured by the leaves. Without this they cannot grow rapidly and hence they will fail to withstand the Influences that lead to abscission. As in the case of nitrogen and other nutrients, much of the carbohydrate food used for the early growth of roots and leaves, as well as for the initial stages in the fruit development, is stored in the tissues during the previous year. As soon as the leaves expand, [however, they begin to produce food which may be utilized immediately. Ringing. That the amount of fruit which sets is markedly in - fluenced by the carbohydrate materials stored in the tissues of the </seg>
            <seg id="p560">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE tree after the flowers are formed may be demonstrated by the follow - ing experiment. A narrow band of bark is removed from a limb two or more inches in diameter early in spring about the time the flowers are opening, or sooner. The set of fruit above the point will usually be much heavier than in other parts of a tree having a similar bloom. Ringing is often a very effective means of causing a set of fruit on varieties such as the Winesap group which are known to have a tendency to produce weak flowers, and under proper conditions an increased set may result from this practice even though other means fail. However, if the trees have a very low reserve of nitrogen, ring - ing may not have the desired effect in improving the set of fruit. It has been shown previously that much nitrogen is necessary for the development of flowers and for the growth of young fruits. The re - moval of a ring of bark not only prevents the downward movement of carbohydrate materials manufactured by the leaves, thus causing an accumulation of this food above the ring, but it seems also to inhibit the upward movement of nitrogen from the roots. The supply to the fruit is,: therefore, limited to that which was stored in the tissue before the dark was removed. If the removal of the' bark is delayed until just before the flowers open, more nitrogen can reach the grow - ing tissues and ringing will, therefore, be more effective in in increas - ing the set of fruit. With respect to the effects of ringing on the set, it is known that an accumulation of carbohydrate materials brings about a strength - ening of fibrous tissues and increases the thickness of cell walls. The fruit is thus held more firmly to the cluster base by the stronger connecting tissues, and the thick cell walls seem to respond more slowly to stimuli that tend to cause abscission. Furthermore, the ability of the fruit tissue to obtain water Is improved by the increase in carbohydrates resulting from ringing. This is also true for the leaf tissue but to a lesser degree. With its normal handicap bo reduced, the fruit is in a better position to obtain the necessary water and nutrients in competition with the leaves. The fruit can, therefore, grow actively and remain on the tree with an adequate water supply. Condition of Growth Daring Preceding Season. Normally, a good carbohydrate supply for the set of fruit depends on a healthy, well nourished leaf surface not only during the crop year but also during the preceding season. The efficiency of the foliage depends to a large extent upon the natural soil and weather conditions, but it may be influenced also by cultural practices such as pruning, fertilization and spraying. The importance in keeping the foliage thrifty and free from insects and diseases even In an off year cannot be overlooked if the best conditions are to be provided, for a satisfactory set of fruit the following spring. It happens not infrequently that a grower, having experienced several crop failures due to lack of cross-pollina - tion, neglects the care and especially the proper spraying of his trees. After several years of such neglect, even the best provisions for cross- </seg>
            <seg id="p561">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY * pollination will fail to produce a satisfactory set. This is shown by the results of hand-pollination with strong pollen on neglected trees compared with trees previously well cared for. I The Previous Tears Crop. During a heavy crop year a large part of the food manufactured by the leaves is required to mature the fruit. Often such a heavy crop prevents flower bud formation, but even though the flowers are formed, the limited supply of food stored in the trunk and roots under such conditions will constitute a distinct handicap for the process of fruit setting the following spring. This is well illustrated by the experience of the growers in the Champlain Valley during the year 1925. That spring the I bloom was very good on most of the Mclntosh trees, but relatively little fruit was harvested from the younger orchards; whereas the old trees had a heavy crop. Pollination and weather conditions were the same for trees of all ages. In the year 1924, however, the young trees had had a heavy crop, while the older trees bore little or no fruit. The poor set of fruit following a heavy cro? may be due not only to the reduced amount of carbohydrates available for the initial stages of fruit development, but also to the smaller amount of stored material available for early root activity. The importance of the early root growth in supplying water and nutrients has already been discussed. Winter injury to the trunk and roots of the tree is also likely to follow a heavy crop year, which may likewise limit the amount of growth producing substances that reaches the jfruit. It is apparent, therefore, .that the trees must be kept unusually vigorous in a crop year to provide the good storage of food essential for a satisfactory set of fruit. Thinning of the fruit so as to leave a larger leaf surface for each of the remaining apples will not only help in developing quality, but is also an Important factor in increasing the amount of food that is stored for the following season. The Importance of Pest Control. Attention should be called briefly to the importance of proper control of Insects and diseases that may reduce the set of fruit. Fruit that is well pollinated and growing on vigorous spurs often fails to develop because of the work of scab, bud moth, red bug, codling moth, and numerous other pests that attack the leaves as well as the flowers and young fruits. Un - fortunately, some of these pests are especially difficult to control dur - ing years when weather conditions are otherwise unfavorable for a good crop. Extra care at such times is, therefore, well worth while and it should not be neglected it the best results are to be obtained from cross-pollination. Too much attention cannot be given to the timeliness and thoroughness of the spray application which is to insure clean fruit as well as- a satisfactory set. An unusually heavy drop is sometimes associated with injury from dusting and spraying. This is especially true when the trees are in a weakened condition to begin with or if </seg>
            <seg id="p562">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE they are sprayed at the wrong time with unreliable spray materials or with mixtures that are too strong. Spraying or dusting with sulphur or other materials while the flowers are in bloom is not a safe practice and may cause heavy shedding. As previously indicated, it is also important to keep the foliage healthy even in an off year if the leaves are to function to the full extent and are to store an abundance of food material required for early growth and for initial stages in fruit development.' The Influence of Weather A discussion of conditions that influence the set of fruit would be incomplete without special reference to the weather. This single factor is of dominating Importance since it has a controlling influence over the processes concerned in tree growth and in the development of flowers and fruits. Whenever the flowers are killed by cold during late winter and early spring, a crop of fruit, of course, is not to be expected, but frequently the flowers may bloom and appear to be normal even though the essential parts have been destroyed or greatly reduced in vitality. The flowers injured by low temperatures often fall to produce normal pollen, or the embryo may be incapable of being fertilized. Seed formation and fruit setting are thus greatly reduced even though the weather at blooming time may be favorable. The influence of temperature, wind, and rainfall on the process of pollination, fertilization, root growth, supply of water, nitrate formation and other conditions that In turn affect the set of fruit has been discussed in the preceding pages. Unfavorable weather condi - tions, especially during the time that the trees are in bloom, are encountered so frequently that it seems wise to insure against a crop failure by making all other conditions as favorable as possible. Trees which have been growing vigorously and which have been kept healthy are much more likely to produce some fruit in years when there is only a minimum number of hours of weather suitable for the process of pollination. The grower should realize that when the weather is especially favorable and when there is an abundance of bees and ample oppor - tunity for cross-pollination he majj^get too many fruits on trees in good vigor. The removal of the excess fruit by hand-thinning Is necessary in such cases and this is a very important practice, not only for the current year's crop but also for the next season's set. Conclusion In the foregoing pages the importance of pollination and other factors in obtaining a set of fruit has been outlined. It is evident that in any intelligently managed orchard program it is to the grower's advantage to make careful provision for pollination according to the location of his orchard and the varieties to be grown. This involves </seg>
            <seg id="p563">NEBRASKA s'fATE hORTiCULTURAL SOCIETY first, the selection of varieties which are good pollenlzers, with par - ticular attention to the time of blooming; second, planting or top - working these In an orchard in sufficient quantity and properly spaced for easy pollen distribution; third, making sure I that a supply of bees is either in or near the orchard at time of blooming. It should be borne in mind also that even with such provision cold or rainy weather may prevent pollen distribution and crop failure results. Further, If an orchard is to derive the benefits of cross-polllna - tioh It is essential that it be in a favorable condition of growth so the developing flowers will be abundantly supplied with water stored food and mineral nutrient. This involves the fundamental re - quirements of suitable soil with particular emphasis upon the drain - age, and a favorable site with reference to exposure. Furthermore, the best practices In pruning, spraying and good soil" management cannot be neglected. Occasionally special practices, such as of ringing, deserve consideration. When the grower has provided all of that, he can but trust to luck that conditions beyond his control will not prevent his getting a crop. I Experiments conducted at the University of Illinois showed the six-cane Kniff en system of training for Concord grapes to be superior to the four-cane system under Illinois conditions. The former type of pruning resulted in a 50% increase in yield. Georgia has a good prospect for peaches up to date. Fort Valley district is showing up rather heavily, lately, with early varieties like Rose and Uneada. It is interesting to note that the peach trees in - fected with "phony" bloom are quite a bit ahead of those free from the trouble. •' </seg>

Both men kept a part of their ewes for a farm flock. Flock No. 4: This man keeps a flock of 100 grade ewes the year round, breeds his ewes to the best purebred rams that he can af - ford to buy, always of the same breed. He has his lambs come about in April and sells them about September 15 every year without feed - ing them any grain, and tops the market at that time every year. . Flock No. 5: These two young men had no previous experience with sheep and their father was dead so their mother let them have the money to buy 125 head of old western summers. They bought 3 purebred ram lambs to use and turned them out with the flock and let them run. They had plenty of good feed. They raised 60 per cent of a lamb crop, and cared for them and were successful. Now they have a flock of 250 young ewes and they like them. Flock No. 6: This is a crippled man with limited capital and unable to work his farm so he rents out the farm land. He has plenty of good feed. He has a lady keeping house for him and she has an equal share in the sheep. They started a few years ago in a small way with just. the cheapest ewes that he could buy and he used the same kind of a ram. Now lie has a farm flock of 90 head of grade ewes and a purebred ram, and they feed and care for them well. They don't necessarily love each other, but they do love their sheep. Flock No. 7: This man is a bachelor and as a young man he had several years' experience with sheep on the range in the west. He came back and bought a farm in Nebraska. He keeps a flock of from 200 to 300 ewes. He says he understands their diseases and how to feed and care for them. He always told his neighbors or anyone in - terested in sheep to let them alone. He is a complete failure with sheep. • Flock No. 8: This man keeps a small farm flock of purebred ewes. He also feeds lambs most every winter and quite often lambs out old ewes. He bought 230 old gummers costing him $1,400.00, during the winter he lost 100 head. From the 130 ewes he had left, he raised 108 lambs. He sold out for $2,300.00. Did he make or lose? Flock No. 9: This man is a lumber dealer and lives in town. He owns several large farms. He says he farms for the pleasure of it. He leases the land and stock on share, several hundred cattle and several hundred hogs. For a number of years he has been keeping a farm flock of 100 breeding ewes using purebred rams. He has kept track of all expenses, and he says that the sheep pay the best for the money invested. Ask him if you don't believe it. </seg>
            <seg id="p571">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATION Reasons Why We Should Have a Farm Flock First, we. should be a lover of sheep because they require care and attention that no other animal does. - They are absolutely help - less to fight their own battles against their enemies and require a caretaker or a. shepherd. Therefore, the man who feels that he would like sheep in that he could love them is the man best fitted to have a farm flock. Keeping sheep for profit then is secondary, for the one that has a flock and cares for them and sees to their wants the best, is bound to receive profit for his efforts. This has be«n proven as long as we have known anything about sheep. Sheep raising as a farm enter - prise continues then because there are many people on our farms who like sheep and because sheep raising is a profitable business. There are numerous qualifications that need to be added to these reasons given. If they are to be suitable to all conditions, and there are many other influences which might be given in support of the farm flock. One of the first statements that is made by a man who is think - ing of sheep is, "I would like to have or keep some sheep but I don't know anything about them." A young man might say, "I would like to have Mabel for a wife but I don't know anything about her." The best way would be to find out a few things before you tie up. Back to the sheep: The size of the flock more than the kind of sheep should be the first thing to be carefully considered. I would not consider four to five sheep a farm flock any imore than I would consider one milk cow a dairy herd. Twenty-five to one hundred ewes would be an ideal sized flock for the average farm. I would not advocate that every farmer in Nebraska should have sheep but that every farmer who thinks he would like sheep would be safe in having a farm flock in proportion to the feed and waste that he has to use, and according to his capacity to care for them. I think I would be safe In saying that there Is not a farm of 160 acres in Nebraska that could not carry a flock of that size of breeding ewes the year round, and the owner would have more hap - piness and money in the end. '.'•'. In starting with a farm flock, the most important thing is the use of a good ram. There is a saying, "A good bull is half the herd, a poor one Is all of it." So it is with a poor ram. Who can afford to buy the best ram? The man with four to five ewes or the man with ten times that many? Who stands the best chance of having good lambs, at market time? The man who has enough ewes to justify a vigorous, correctly made purebred ram or the man who has so few ewes that he keeps a ram lamb that Isn't good enough to go to market? Who will have enough lambs and enough wool to war - rant some care in the preparation for market? If you will think about these things, you will come to the right conclusion about the 10 </seg>
            <seg id="p572">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE size of the farm flock and will realize that perhaps after all, one of the real reasons for the criticisms of farm flock husbandry lies in the failure of many of us to appreciate some of the fundamental features of successful farm sheep raising. The keeping of sheep should make one a better man. If you are familiar with the reading of the Good Book, you will know that it says a good deal about sheep and lambs.. You know that the lamb has an appetite for a great variety of foods, so if we feed it the right food it soon develops into a sheep. So it was when Jesus asked one of his Shepherds if he^ loved him; and he said he did. Jesus told him to feed his lambs. * Jesus asked him again if he loved him and he said, "You know that I love you." Jesus told him to feed his sheep. So the keeping of a farm flock will show us our responslbilty to them. And it should show us our responsibility to God and our fellow men. I thank you. MR. WEBER: The next speaker on our program is Dr. F. D. Keim of the Agronomy Department who will talk on "Some Weeds That Sheep Will Kill." Dr. Keim. ."..•■■• .-"• ;■ .:•■..) . ■ SOME WEEDS THAT SHEEP WILL KILL DR. P. D. KEIM Mr. Weber, ladies, and gentlemen: Mr. Brown has a lot of ad - vantage over me. I see he knows a great deal about sheep and weeds that sheep eat, but I do not know much about sheep. A few months ago I visited an old friend down in Nemaha County. I noticed his farmstead was conspicuous because of .its lack of weeds. The farmstead was located in a bend of the creek and would have been an excellent place for a perfect wilderness of wild hemp, greater rag weeds and artichokes. Instead of this wilderness I saw a beautiful yard and small pasture covered with a splendid turf of blue grass. To add to the beauty, wonderful old oaks, elms and black walnut trees were scattered around the yard not too thick to hinder the blue grass. Knowing this friend so well I was sure this lack of weeds was not due to the use of the old arm strong or scythe. I knew him to be a man of both strong mind and body. He preferred, however, to use his mind rather than his body. He used to say, "Why use your hands when you can do It with your head?" Well, he was mowing his weeds with his Head alias a fine farm flock of sheep. Not only was he keeping the farmstead beautiful and making It a fine place to live but he was converting waste In the form of weeds into wool and mutton. This friend insisted that this small herd of sheep practically lived on- what would have otherwise been wasted. </seg>
            <seg id="p573">' . NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATION Save Time and Labor I saw another striking example this summer in Idaho. It was my privilege to travel over rather a large area -of irrigated land with an old friend who knew most of the farmers by name. Being a banker he was much interested in them and in fact, like many other bankers of this day and age, owned several farms not necessarily because he wanted to but because he had to. On most of these places, that were making reasonable interest on investments, the ditches were fenced and a farm flock of sheep were keeping the usual list of weeds as well as the willows cleaned out in fine shape. This banker remarked that sheep would soon pay for the fence and in many cases he was willing to advance money to build the fence. The Illustration was striking in that where ever the j ditches were fenced they were clean and the water flowed along without trouble. The sheep not only saved him the trouble and expense of clearing ditches with willows and continually mowing the weeds, but they made the farm look very sightly and in most cases made the farmer a hand - some profit. It has been conservatively estimated that cattle and horses eat about 50 per cent of the various weeds growing on the average farm. Sheep eat approximately 95 per cent and goats even peel the shirt off ones .back if he doesnt watch ' out. Sheep Make Returns on 95 Per Cent of Weeds It has been conservatively estimated that weeds exact a toll of $2.00 per acre off all tilled land in Nebraska. If this is true, weeds rob Nebraska of approximately $34,000,000.00 annually. Gentlemen, this is too much of a loss and I believe it can be materially reduced and I believe sheep can help us do it. I feel very sure that most of you can give just as good illus - trations as I have given. Is it not true that we do not hear very much that is new? In other words, if we practiced what we really know and observe every day we would not be here in this meeting this morning. My interest therefore is not in giving you much new infor - mation because I do not have it, but I am anxious that we do use and put into practice the things we do know. Let us classify weeds into annuals, those that live one year only, and then into perennials, those that live two years or more. Now it is obvious that if a plant only lives one . year and spreads only by seeds, the best means of eradication is to not allow the weeds to go to seed, or if they do go to seed to destroy as many of them as possible before another crop is to be planted. Sheep are almost sure death to all young succulent weeds. If stubble fields are pastured heavy, enough, sheep will not permit weeds to go to seed and If they do they will eat many of the seed and tramp </seg>
            <seg id="p574">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE others in the ground where they will germinate and start growth and be killed either by being eaten or tramped out I Perennials Hard tx&gt; Kill Perennial weeds are not so easy to get rid of. They not only ppread by seeds but many of them spread by underground roots and stems. Two very important principles then must be considered. They should not be allowed to set seed and the underground parts should not be allowed to develop. Continual close grazing of course will accomplish the first and also the second if continued long enough and pastured so close that very little or no vegetative growth is allowed to develop. The leaves as you know act as little food factories and if no leaves are left, the roots and underground stems are finally starved out. Sheep have been known to kill out sow thistles, Canadian thistles and many "other very bad perennials. Give the Grass a Chance Now just a word in regard to this close grazing problem. Most of our perennial grasses and legumes used for pastures and meadows start very much earlier than most of the weed pests. Especially is this true of the summer annuals such as foxtails, crab grass, etc. If these pasture grasses and legumes are to make growth during the pasture season, it is very necessary that they be allowed to make growth so as to store up food reserves in their roots and under ground parts. For this reason it usually is very important to give them a chance to make a good growth early in the spring before turning the stock out. A barn yard corral is, therefore, one of the essentials of good pastures.

            <seg id="p575">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATION Rotation grazing or delayed grazing is an excellent practice. By this I mean having several lots and rotating the stock from one to the other giving each lot a chance to make enough growth to store up root reserves. A few sheep following such a system will usually clean up the weeds the cows will not eat and will make for cleaner pastures. While close grazing at times is very essential in killing weeds pastures cannot be continually close grazed the entire season and still maintain a good turf of grasses that will furnish maximum feed per acre. Careful management is always necessary. Not enough in - formation is known concerning these root reserves. Work is now in progress which will no doubt give us more information. It is rather uncommon, in fact not common enough, to see sheep turned into mature corn fields. The sheep will usually clean up all the weeds and corn leaves and if not left in the field too long will disturb the corn ears very little. This seems to me to be an ex - cellent practice if it can be handily worked into the practical man - agement of a farm. Now as to the weeds that sheep will eat. Show: Foxtails, water grass, crab grass, pig weeds, lamb Quarters etc. . MR. WEBER: I am going to give you an opportunity to ask questions today. The boys will pass out cards. If you have any questions relative to the feeding and management of sheep, write them on the cards and put your name and address on these cards, so If for some reason we find it Impossible to answer these questions this afternoon we can write you. I should like to suggest this. A number have asked regarding bulletins giving rations for farm flocks and also giving the results of our experiments with western ewes. If you wish material of that kind, Just indicate that on |the card. Then an - other thing I want to mention. First, in regard to tickets for the banquet. The Master Farmer banquet is to be held tonight at the Cornhusker Hotel. Tickets are $1.00. Tomorrow night is the Fun Feed, tickets 75 cents. The boys have these tickets and you can get them from them. ■ Now, about this afternoon's sheep meeting. This will be held in the Animal Pathology building. That's the building right north. We have two outstanding speakers for this afternoon. One of them is with us this morning. Mr. John Naylor of Central City will talk on "Tho Shepherd's Worst Enemy." A reporter came around a while ago and asked Mr. Naylor what he was going to talk about. Mr. Naylor told him that if a man didn't know what the shepherd's worst enemy was, he wouldn't tell him now, he would have to come to the meeting this afternoon and find out. Another speaker on this pro - gram is Dr. I. E, Newspm of Fort Collins, Colorado. He is generally </seg>

Now if you have written your questions, and by the way, I am scheduled to talk here this morning, put them in the wastepaper basket. They are not going to be handled this way until after they are answered, I assure you that. It is quite a big job that has been given me today. Mr. Wag - gener said, "You will be chairman and you have to appear on the program." My topic is "Grinding Feed for Sheep" and I will try to stick to my subject. Both Mr. Brown and Dr. Keim have hinted that we do not always do just what we know is the best thing to do. That reminds me of a story of a man, Dr. England, who was with the U. S. Department of Agriculture. He had attended a "number of agri - cultural colleges and always wanted to help the farmers. One day he was driving around and came to a farm that looked as though it wasn't being taken very good care of. Dr. England looked about the farm and finally found the man sitting half asleep with a fishing pole stuck in the bank of his creek. Dr. England went up to him and said, "My good man, could I be of some assistance to you in your farming?

GRINDING FEED FOR SHEEP — WHERE, WHEN, WHY Sheep masticate their feed more thoroughly than other classes of livestock. In spite of this fact, there is a growing tendency among farmers to use ground feeds for sheep of all classes and ages. That grinding is not always profitable is borne out by the results of tests conducted at many Agricultural Experiment Stations. The argument most frequently advanced for grinding is that the small particles or feed are more completely digested since they should be more easily penetrable to the digestive juices. Experimental re - sults do not substantiate this belief except in the case of a few hard grains, such as millet and hulless barley, or with aged sheep having such poor teeth that they are unable to chew their food properly. </seg>
            <seg id="p577">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS 1 ASSOCIATION Many Factors Determine Advisability of Grinding No sweeping recommendation can be made in regard to grinding feed for sheep. As a general rule one or more of the following factors will determine the advisability of this practice: 1. Age of sheep and condition of their teeth, 2. Kind of grain or roughage available, 3. Methods of feed lot management to be used. The most satisfactory way to discuss the grinding problem is to consider these factors in relation to three groups of sheep, namely; creep-fed lambs, aged west - ern ewes, and western feeding lambs. Lambs must be fed grain in a creep if they are to be fat enough for slaughter at weaning time. They will start nibbling when about two weeks of age. Ground grains are best for these youngsters, at least until they are three or four months old, j at which age they should be ready for market. Young lambs will take to ground grain more readily and consume more of it than they -will of whole grain. 1029 LIVESTOCK JUDGING TEAM Bottom row, li-fi to rinht: Edward Jnnlke.

Coarse, stemmy hay should be fed to old sheep, since it is not relished by young lambs when ground, and they waste^a great deal when it is fed whole. A high percentage of the lambs marketed at weaning time are raised from old, broken-mouthed western ewes. The lambs are more dependent upon their mothers' milk than upon the ration fed in a creep. Furthermore, practically all of these old ewes are marketed with their lambs. If they lose weight during the suckling period they are likely to sell at from $3.00 to $5.00 a hundred pounds less than fat ewes. The upshot of the whole thing is that liberal feeding is necessary for milk production, wool production, maintenance, and fattening. Most of these ewes have poor teeth which means that the grain must be ground if satisfactory results are to be obtained. Some of them have no incisors at all and are known as gummers. Until nome ingenious person invents false teeth for these old toothless nan - nies, there will be a place for a feed grinder on every farm handling this class of stuff. • • Ground Hay Good for Old Ewes A comparison of ground hay and whole hay when fed to preg - nant western ewes was made in a 60-day feeding test Just completed at the University of Nebraska. Two hundred ewes were divided into two lots of 100 each. Both lots received approximately one and one - half pounds of ground ear corn per head daily. Lot 1 was fed alfalfa hay and lot 2 .received alfalfa meal made from the same grade of hay fed in lot 1. It is interesting to note that lot 2 consumed 2.17 pounds of alfalfa meal per head dally as compared to an average dally consumption of 1.91 pounds of alfalfa hay in lot 1. There was no alfalfa meal wasted while a. considerable amount of alfalfa stems were either refused or pulled from the racks and trampled under foot. The larger consumption of alfalfa meal was reflected in the gains. The average initial weight was 124 pounds in both lots. The ewes fed alfalfa meal made an average gain of 27 pounds in 60 days as compared to a gain of 19 pounds per head in lot 1 where alfalfa hay was fed. The gains in both Jots seem high, unless we consider the fact that these ewes were pregnant and that the development of the unborn lambs represented a considerable part of the gain. In lot 1, 495| pounds of corn and 595 pounds of alfalfa hay were required for 100 pounds gain as compared to 347 pounds of corn and 478 pounds of alfalfa meal in lot 2. With ground ear corn charged at $1.10 per Cwt., alfalfa hay at $15.00 a ton and alfalfa meal at $18.00 a ton, the feed cost of 100 pounds of gain was $9.«0 in the alfalfa hay lot as compared to $8.12 in the alfalfa meal lot. In other words, the grinding of alfalfa hay for these aged preg - nant ewes increased the hay consumption, increased the gain 8 pounds per ewe in 60 days, and decreased the cost of 100 pounds gain $1.78. Whether or not the ewes fed alfalfa meal will hold this advantage </seg>
            <seg id="p579">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS 1 ASSOCIATION over those fed alfalfa hay when they are ready for market remains to be seen. The results thus far, however, clearly indicate that it pays to grind the hay for old ewes with poor teeth. Do Not Grind for Western Lambs Western feeder lambs that average around 60 pounds into Ne - braska feed lots have excellent teeth and can do a good job grinding their own grain. The old saying, "A sheep which cannot grind Its rown grain is not worth feeding," is a truthful jorie when applied to western lambs. Under ordinary conditions of feeding, it has been found at both the Wisconsin and Nebraska Stations that grinding actually lowers the value of shelled corn for western lambs. The whole grain is more palatable, probably due to (the fact that ground corn soon becomes rancid when stored. Ear corn gave as good re - sults as shelled corn at the Minnesota and Illinois Stations. The most recent test to determine the advisability of grinding grains for western lambs was conducted during the winter of 1928-29 at the Minnesota Station. The results are similar to those obtained at other stations, as well as being in agreement with experiences of commercial feeders. All lots received alfalfa hay and a protein sup - plement and in addition lot 1 was fed ear corn, lot 2 ground corn and cob meal, lot 3 whole barley, lot 4 ground barley, lot 5 whole barley 55— whole oats 35, lot 6 ground barley 1 5 6 — ground oats 35, lot 7 whole barley 55 — whole oats 35, self-fed, lot 8 ground barley 55 — ground oats 35, self-fed. i " P. S.'Jordon and W. H. Peters of the Minnesota Station say, "The most striking result secured in this experiment is the fact that whole grain proved a better feed for fattening lambs than ground grain. It will be noted that the even numbered lots received the same feeds aß' the odd numbered lots preceding them, the only dif - ference being that in the even numbered lots the feed was ground. In each of the four comparisons the whole grain lots made the great - est gain per lamb at the lowest cost per hundred pounds gain and in all but the ground ear corn lot were given the highest appraisal value, all of which' made for a greater profit' per lamb." The most economical use of hay depends chiefly upon feeding no more of it than the lambs will clean up. There is no need of wasting any hay when a good grade of alfalfa is fed. If the hay is coarse and stemmy, from 10 to 20 per cent may be wasted, in which case It may pay to grind it, especially if j hay is high In price. Low grade roughages such as corn fodder are sometimes ground and used as a substitute for a part of the alfalfa. Death l/oss Less on Ground Feed Although there will be little or no saving in cost of gains affected by grinding grain or roughage for western lambs, under some methods Of management it may prove advisable. In UJree tests at the Ne- </seg>
            <seg id="p580">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE braska Station, it was found that lambs could be crowded to the limit with less danger of death losses on cracked corn and alfalfa meal or alfalfa molasses meal than on shelled corn and alfalfa hay. Overeating on corn is responsible for many deaths among feed lot lambs. When the ground grain is mixed with alfalfa meal it is dir - ficult for the lamb to pick out the grain which no doubt accounts for the greater safety of this method of heavy grain feeding. This method is commonly used when it is desired to shorten the feeding period, or to fatten a bunch of large framed lambs that, are likely to be too heavy If allowed to grow while they fatten. Commercial feeders who buy all their feed and depend upon a rapid turnover for profits, usually self-feed a mixture of ground grain and ground roughage. In conclusion, may I say that it will pay to grind the grain but not the hay for creep-fed lambs; both grain and hay should be ground for old sheep with poor teeth; but grinding is of doubtful value for western lambs as well as natives over four months of age, unless one wishes to crowd them to the limit on grain in order to shorten the feeding period and hit an early market.

            <seg id="p581">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS 1 ASSOCIATION FEED LOT LOSSES AND THEIR CONTROL DR. I. E. NEWSOM Mr. Weber, ladies, and gentlemen: I have a few slides that I want to show you a little bit later, but I thought I would introduce this talk with a few comments regarding whai jwe know about sheep disease. My knowledge of sheep diseases, and particularly feed lot diseases, has come through experience over a period of years. I have been located in an area where we feed approximatly one million-lambs each' winter, this winter one and a half million, j Being connected with the veterinary school, the Iamb feeders naturally come to us for advice. Most often we were helpless In being of any real assistance because only a little was known about sheep diseases, and even that little was of no service in interpreting deaths in feed-lot animals. Because of our peculiar position, our experiment station projects have dealt very- largely with sheep problems, and while we find that we are still at sea on many of our common difficulties, as we look back over the last twenty-five' years we feel that we have been able to recognize certain of the maladies and differentiate between them In a manner which was not formerly possible. In a broad way we may divide these troubles into three general groups;] those associated with shipping, those with feeding, and finally those due to parasites. Shipping Most of the shipping diseases are due to Infection, and yet prac - tically all of them have auxiliary causes which| are controllable. The mere fact that a disease is due to a germ does not mean that that disease will run rampant whenever the germ is present. We are in - clined to think that for the most part, these germs are almost con - stantly present in the sheep, but that it is only in the presence of untoward conditions, lowered vitality, that they really become oper - ative and dangerous. I suspect that this statement is true of many of our diseases of animals and quite certainly so of those of man. We must recognize that there are diseases like the foot and mouth disease to which practically all individuals In a herd are susceptible, and In which the chief factor is exposure to the' Infection, rather than any lowered vigor on the part of the animal. { This disease will run widely through a flock regardless of the general state of health or of any other factor, so far as our knowledge goes at the present time. Fortunately for us however, this disease does not now exist In the United States and we trust that our efficient Bureau of Animal Industry will continue to keep us from It. Lanibs Require Care While In Transit Most of the shipping diseases of sheep exhibit themselves within two weeks after the animals arrive in the lots and when they .become severe in any particular band we can usually trace back to some </seg>
            <seg id="p582">REPORT OV NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE error in transportation that could have been, or should have been avoided. I shall not trouble you with a considerable discussion of individual diseases, their symptoms, or methods of treatment, but it is worthwhile to take up some cases for illustration. In 1923 we had an outbreak of paratyphoid dysentery, involving something like 30,000 lambs, with a loss of approximately 2,000. Measured in loss of flesh the money loss would probably have been double that indicated by the death rate. In our investigation of the outbreak we found that the disease started in a lot of lambs that were held in the railroad yards at Billings, Montana, for a period of nine days, owing to a tie-up of transportation. As a result of severe and prolonged rains which occurred that fall it was impossible to bring the lambs from Montana and Wyoming down into the Fort Collins area over the direct route. Finally, after these lambs were held for the period mentioned they were shipped to Alliance, Ne - braska, and then back into Fort Collins by this roundabout way. During the time they were in the yards at Billings, it rained prac - tically every day, and there were few facilities for feeding. Such hay as was furnished was tramped into the mud and only a portion of it was consumed. Even before the lambs left there they had developed a severe dysentery which continued for some time after they arrived in Fort Collins. Practically all other lambs that came into the Fort Collins district during the next week or ten days came over the same route and were exposed to the infection left by the original ones. To show that the difficulty in shipping and the lack of food was the essential factor, I call your attention especially to two lots of lambs coming from Edgar, Montana. In the first lot the animals were gathered at the shipping point where they were held for almost forty-eight hours without feeding. They were then put on a train and were not unloaded until forty-one hours later. Consequently, these lambs went almost four days without feed. The loss on them was 16 per cent. The second lot arrived in Edgar on the day the first lot was shipped. They were immediately loaded, and were un - loaded and fed the next morning, coming through to Fort Collins by easy stages, and without going long without food. They contracted the disease also but the loss was only 2 per cent. We Isolated the bacterium causing this malady, and showed very conclusively that animals could withstand large doses of the organism when given by the mouth, if they are fed regularly, whereas lambs fasted forty-eight or seventy-two hours were highly susceptible to comparatively small amounts. We had another,. but a smaller outbreak of the disease this year, in lambs coming from Texas. They were on the road a total of six days and all too infrequent feedings. While the loss was compara - tively small, yet the situation was similar to that of 1923. </seg>
            <seg id="p583">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATION Most Shipping Diseases Trace to Poor Management While in Transit About ten years ago we had a considerable amount I of hem - orrhagic septicemia which was clearly traceable to exposure during the period of shipping from the ranges to the feed lots. While this is a germ disease it is now well recognized that exposure to cold, fatigue and factors of this nature are chiefly concerned in its pro - duction. In fact we never get hemorrhagic septicemia in the feed lots after the animals are on full feed and especially animals that are even reasonably well protected. As far as feeding lambs are concerned it is almost wholly a shipping disease] Again, animals can stand a good deal of exposure to this organism- if they are properly protected in. shipping. Sore Mouth Also Dangerous Sore mouth is a disease that is seen by practically all feeders of any^ experience, usually within the first week or ten days after the lambs come into the lots. Crusts form on the lips, the lips swell and the lambs may even show difficulties in eating. It is so common that it is almost expected. Usually within two weeks the crusts drop off, the animals return to normal and are little the worse for the disease. In recent years, however, we have found many complica - tions which seem to arise from this comparatively simple malady, and which have caused us a good deal of loss. In 1 a lot of a thousand lambs that were shipped from Montana to Omaha and back to Sterling, Colorado, a few years ago, complications of this disease developed in such numbers as to cause the loss of one hundred sixteen animals. These complications consisted of ulcers in the mouth, on the tongue, the larynx, in the stomach, and finally in the lungs. This developed a pneumonia which is usually fatal. We have about come to the conclusion that this comparatively simple malady ought to be treated in order to avoid these complications. The longer the trip and the more prolonged the exposure the worse this disease becomes. This year coccldlal dysentery has been more prevalent than it has ever previously been. Altogether we have .been able to tabulate eight outbreaks with the loss of approximately 5 per cent. Practic - ally 25 per cent, however, show symptoms of the disease. This is chiefly manifested by bloody diarrhoea. In nearly every instance the disease developed within two weeks of the time the lambs arrived In the pens. Indicating very clearly that exposure in shipping was the chief factor. It could not be shown, however, as In the case of paratyphoid dysentery that hunger was a factor, nor as In the case of hemorrhagic septicemia that exposure to cold .had any influence. More likely these lambs had never been previously exposed to coccldial infection and when they were loaded onto the cars, and particularly when they were unloaded at common feeding points they picked up the organisms which were of unusual virulence because of the great amount of susceptible material. </seg>
            <seg id="p584">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE There are still problems that need to be worked out with this disease but judging from the findings in other animals, particularly in poultry, we must believe that most mature animals harbor these parasites, and that young animals will ordinarily develop a high de - gree of resistance without showing symptoms of the disease if they can be carried successfully through the period of first exposure. Con - sequently any untoward Influence at this time probably precipitates the more serious symptoms. We have often wondered why we have a large outbreak of paratyphoid in one year, in another hemorrhaglc sopticemia, and still in a third coccldial dysentery, and yet this seems to be the case. We have not had a serious outbreak of hemorrhagic sc-pticemia for six or seven years,, although ten or twelve years ago it was very common. Just why these variations occur we do not know but we attribute all of these diseases more particularly to dif - ficulties in shipping. Since that is true, many of them could be avoided. You need to know that your lambs are fed every twenty - four hours in transit, that they are not held at the shipping point several days waiting for cars, and that the weather conditions during shipping are as favorable as possible. I know that these can't always be controlled but more attention to them would pay large dividends. When we recall that the feeder lambs have just been taken from their mothers, shipped long distances, and put onto - feeds that are entirely strange to them we cannot wonder that they develop all sorts of maladies. Imagine what would happen If human babies were placed under similar conditions.

            <seg id="p585">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS ASSOCIATION Feeding These difficulties begin soon after the animals arrive in the lots and continue until they are shipped to market. There Is a critical time when the animals are being taught to eat grain. Great care must be exercised not to raise the grain ration too rapidly. It must be remembered that these animals have not been accustomed to eat - ing grain, and some of them are very slow to acquire the habit. This means that those that do take to it quickly may get entirely too much, and as a result suffer from indigestion. Consequently we have a lot of scouring and diarrhoea in lambs that are just being put onto grain. It seems to matter very little whether the grain is barley or corn. Apparently oats are safest, but they are not Very fattening. It Is a common custom with us to start the lambs on barley and then change to corn. This is largely an economic question, however, be - cause barley is. ordinarily a little cheaper and corn gives a better finish. When this change is made there is another critical time that should be carefully handled, and the change made graduallyJ Finally when the lambs go onto full feed or nearly so, sonie of the better ones are almost fat enough for market. At this period and for some time on until the last of them is shipped, the losses may become very severe. ' Feed Lot Losses Are Severe Here is a problem that has given us very much concern during the last six or eight years because here is a disease that affects the fattest, strongest, and most vigorous animals in the lots, and destroys them at times with the rapidity of an apoplectic stroke. When these lambs are seen at all they usually show brain symptoms. The head is thrown back, the lambs may walk in a circle, sometimes they push against the fence or the feed rack, finally they get down and may die within a few minutes, or in some instances may last for days or even weeks. We are frequently asked why this disease has become so prominent in the last few years, and why it was not noticed in the earlier periods of our feeding history. I can only say that in those days there was no hurry about feeding the lambs. Five months was not an unusual feeding period, there was no dockage on fat lambs. Lambs came in from the range much smaller than at present, the competition was not fierce, as it !is now, hay was the cheapest item and could be fed in unlimited quantities. It was un - necessary to push the grain. All these factors have combined to make this condition the serious malady that it is at present. I do not pretend to know just what this condition is. We know many of its manifestations, we know a good deal about the condition . of the blood and the urine, and we also know! a particular amount of grain can not be depended on to kill a lamb] While we recognize that It is closely associated with the amount of [grain fed we are not at all sure, that it is due to the grain Itself, and yet the easiest way to stop this loss is to remove the grain. In our experience it will do </seg>
            <seg id="p586">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 11 in every case and do it within three days. Of course that isn't the way we control It because lambs must receive grain if they are to be fattened. What we actually do. is to bring the lambs onto full feed as gradually las possible; mix the grain with the auxiliary foods such as beet pulp, ensilage, cotton seed meal, molasses, as they can be obtained; take special precautions that each lamb receives his share, and his only; ship the fat lambs as soon as they are ready for market, and cut back on the amount of grain given to the bal - ance. There are a great many little things in feeding such as have been mentioned above, that can readily be practiced in feeding, and will go a long way toward controlling this condition. Even the mat - ter of sorting lambs' so that we have all of any given size in' the same pen is too often neglected, but is highly important. Now this problem which we have called over-eating was not brought to our attention first from the feed lots, but rather from the pea fed lambs in the San Luis Valley. There they try to harvest the pease by letting the lambs out onto the field for a given time each day. After jabout thirty days with such handling this malady develops to such a degree that if often forces the shipping of half - fat lambs to market and makes it difficult to clean up the fields. We studied that problem ' for several years before coming to the very ob - vious conclusion that the amount of peas was the material factor, al - though we always knew that as soon as the lambs were loaded onto the cars and shipped to market the death losses stopped immediately. We even traced these lambs into other feeding areas where they were pen fed and where they showed no higher loss than other pen fed animals. While we have had that problem under consideration for many years we have never worked out an entirely satisfactory means of handling the situation,' so that today only a comparatively few lambs are fed on peas in that area. Lambing Down Corn Dangerous A few years ago we found we could raise a fairly good quality or corn in our high altitude. The only difficulty was that it did not mature. That didn't particularly matter, however, if we could har - vest the corn out of the fields by turning in the lambs. Just as in the pea fields, after the' lambs had been on the. corn for about thirty days and had cleaned up most of the leaves and weeds and other roughages they started in on the ears, and the losses began in great numbers. While some men reported considerable success yet hardly anyone attempts it now. The reason was that no one could work out a safe procedure for lambing down corn, that in the end was economically profitable. Consequently, whether in the pens, in the pea fields or in the corn fields, when lambs consume too much grain they die in great numbers, regardless of what may be the actual cause of death. </seg>
            <seg id="p587">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS 1 ASSOCIATION Parasites Dr. Maurice C. Hall has asked the question, "Are we losing the fight against parasites?" The way in which he answers it indicates that he feels that we are. As long as lambs were raised on the western range certain types of parasites predominated, whereas others that are so common in farm flocks were almost non-existent When we first started feeding lambs the only parasites to give us any con - cern were those that cause scab. Twenty-five years ago two govern - ment inspectors were maintained in the Fort! Collins area through - out the winter, merely for the purpose of recognizing sheep scab and supervising dipping. Practically every plant 6l any proportions had its dipping vats. Now when scab does occasionally develop it is rather difficult to find a vat, and sheep are often driven considerable distances for this purpose. Scab does still exist in sheep and it is still serious if allowed to develop, so that on (the first indication of sheep biting themselves it is well to call a veterinarian to make sure that scab does, not exist. However, practically; all feeder lambs are now inspected and come from areas that are designated as clean by the U. S. Government. Scab, therefore, is of little importance as compared with former years. As long as we were dipping frequently for scab, ticks were not a menace, but now that sheep are rarely dipped, ticks sometimes in - crease to the point of causing a good deal of irritation and conse - quent loss of flesh. Consequently, where ticks! are numerous one or two dippings during the feeding season will often be of value in keeping them down and will probably pay in the increased weight of the sheep. The ideal method of controlling ticks would be to dip twice, with a twenty-four day interval. Grub in the head is very frequently present in breeding sheep. .In fact, it may be assumed that these parasites are usually present in the sinuses of the head during the winter [months. Occasionally they are seen in lambs but ordinarily they probably cause little dis - turbance in feeding sheep. Most of the brain symptoms shown in feed lambs are associated with errors in feeding rather than being due to parasites in the head. Worms Numerous in Sheep ■ The tape worms commonly found in sheep are of two general types. The fringed tape worm, which is small and is frequently found In the ducts of the liver, has always been plentiful in western lambs. Even today we see bands in which practically every lamb shows the presence of these parasites. While all sorts of Illnesses have been attributed to their presence, our experience indicates that outside of an occasional case they cause no deaths and probably only minor disturbances. This statement is made from the observations that not infrequently fat lambs in the packing houses are seen heavily in- </seg>
            <seg id="p588">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE fcsted. There is a tape worm, however, that is much longer, running up to fifteen feet. It appears in the small intestines and may cause losses. This is the large tape worm and is apparently increasing in our western feeder lambs. We haven't yet found it necessary to treat whole flocks, such as must be done in farm raised sheep, but the time may come when this will have to be done. Unfortunately we do not know the intermediate host of either of these tape worms so that we have no way of controlling the spread of the disease by destroy - ing the host. We are, therefore, limited to individual treatment of sheep suffering from invasion by them. No one has yet discovered any satisfactory means of dislodging the tape worms from the bile ducts, although they are easily removed from the intestines. Stomach worms, the bane of sheep men on the farm, are also ncreasing in western feeder lambs, although as yet we have seen no instance in which it was necessary to administer treatment for this condition. A few years ago stomach worms in feeder lambs were practically unknown, but now they are not unusual. Fortunately however, they are seldom present in such quantities as to cause any serious disturbance, and so long as that is the case they probably do not require treatment. The time may come, however, when feeder lambs will have to be dosed for stomach worms, as is now so fre - quently practiced on farm sheep. When that time does come it will materially affect the economic status of the feeding industry. In the old days when sheep were moved on the range and grazed over the same area only occasionally these parasites were practically unknown, but with the decrease In the ranges and the increase in the number of sheep, stomach worms will take an increasing toll. Worms Affect Brain There is a- very interesting tape worm infestation which has probably received more attention than it deserves because of its rarity, and that is the disease which the old Scotch shepherds called ■sturdy" or "gid." This disease is due to an infestation of the brain by the cyst form of the tape worm coming from the dog. The little cyst develops in the brain and keeps increasing in size until by pres - sure the animal succumbs. The disease. so far as our experience goes has been seen only in Montana lambs, in which state it was described many years ago. I see no reason for any alarm because the condi - tion has seemingly made no headway in the last thirty years Treat - ment of sheep dogs at frequent intervals with tape worm remedies could be depended on to control it: Flukes and nodular worms might occasionally be seen, but we still have our first feeder lambs to see that are infested with these parasites. Flukes might be expected in Texas lambs and yet while we feed considerable number of lambs from that state, we have not ohserved them. The nodular disease, so far as I am aware, does not exist in Colorado. </seg>
            <seg id="p589">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS 1 ASSOCIATION Veterinarian Should Be Competent It must be remembered that sheep suffer from as great a variety of illnesses as any other animals, and that a rational management of sheep troubles is dependent upon an accurate diagnosis. It is not to be expected that the sheep feeder is familiar with the manifesta - tions exhibited by each of the diseases with which the lambs may be affected. He will, therefore, find it not only useful, but almost neces - sary to employ the services of his local veterinarian. It must be admitted that veterinarians in past years have given little attention to sheep diseases, but there is an increasing interest in this subject among practitioners, and with a little encouragement from the sheep men themselves, veterinarians ought to become^ reasonably proficient in handling the maladies of sheep. With the rapid passing of the horse, the practitioner has been forced through necessity to turn his attention to the food producing animals, and while some of the older men do not readily make the change the younger men who are coming out of our schools now often know more about the disorders of sheep swine, and even poultry, than they do about those of horses. In a sheep feeding district it is quite important that there be a close relationship between the feeders and the veterinarian, other - wise most of the troubles will go undetermined. While individual treatment of sheep may not be highly profitable, yet In certain diseases individual treatment Is the only method we have of controlling the malady. In most Instances, however, general direction and advice for flock handling will give greater returns than individual remedies. MR.

            <seg id="p590">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE I turn the gavel this morning over to a large hog producer of Seward. He is president of the Nebraska Feeders Association and vice-president of the Nebraska' Improved Live Stock Breeders Associa - tion. Mr. Dan Hildebrand. MR. HILDEBRAND: Mr. Waggoner, ladies, and gentlemen: It is a pleasure, I know, for you men as well as for me to be here again at this annual meeting at our State University. I am only sorry that this room is not entirely filled, for the good things we have had and are going to have are going to be worth while. The feed, those of you who were at the Master Farmer banquet last night, was certainly worth while, j It was one of the best we have ever had. It was. truly worth while. I drove home to Seward last night. There were lots of people talking about the banquet and wondering how farmers had time to make up such good, speeches as those farmers gave last night. It rather surprised all of us. Certainly we are progressing. As Mr. Waggener said, this program will have to be hurried along on account of the lateness of the hour. The gentleman who is going to be introduced to you now needs no introduction. He is one of the faculty members here at the University. I do not know whether he had anything to do with it or not, but I have noticed that shortly you are going to be trading in hog futures. The plan is going to permit you to sell your hogs approximately the way you sell corn, wheat, or the miller buys his grain on the Board. I be - lieve this man Hedges will have a message today that will be worth while. I do not know just what he will touch on today. It is my privilege to introduce Mr. Harold Hedges who will address you on "I May Be Wrong." Mr. Hedges. ' . - : ' '■ I MAX BE WRONG HAROLD HEDGES Mr. Hildebrand, ladies, and gentlemen: That title, "I May Be Wrong," reminds me of the group of -farmers who did not know what the wheat market was going to do, so they thought they would send a man to Chicago to work on the Board to figure out what was going to happen. After he got there,- of course, his fellow farmers were very anxious to hear from him, he sent back a telegram which read as follows: "Some think it will go up; some think it will go down. I do too. Whatever you do will be wrong. Act at once." Hog prices even at the winter "low" In prices are still high enough to offer good profits to you more efficient producers of pork. Those who attend such meetings as these are usually the best of farmers — men and women who are interested in doing the job more efficiently and developing a better life on Nebraska farms. </seg>
            <seg id="p591">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATION There are two sides to this hog game that require consideration and both are important. I am not prepared io state which is the more important, because that is immaterial anyway. On the one side we have the problems of production or management. Perhaps they might be labelled the efficiency problems, because they involve factors which affect the production costs. On the other side are the market or price factors. The two sets of factors are closely related. The animal pro - duced must meet the needs of the market in kind and quality if it is to bring a satisfactory price. The selection of feeds has its price aspect. Thus we see how production factors tie in with market factors. A Cent Saved in Cost Is Worth Two Cents Added to the Selling Price There is a statement you may have heard before, but it will bear repeating, that a cent saved in cost is worth two cents added to the selling price. Is that true, and, if so. why? What is the effect of an advance in the price of a commodity on consumption? It tends to reduce the quantity wanted in the market. On the other hand a reduction in cost of production will permit a reduced selling price' The result is that consumption is stimulated. JMore of the product is wanted, new uses are found for it, and society in general is bene - fited. American labor is paid many times what Chinese labor is paid, not entirely because American labor is organized but because it is very much more productive.. The highly paid; American workman operating a machine produces manfold more than the poorly paid Chinaman with his primitive methods. That is why he gets more pay. The same holds true in agriculture. Of two farmersj the one who can raise hogs at the lowest cost gets the best wage for his labor. If high efficiency is obtained among hog producers as a group and lower prices result, society is benefited and farmers share in the benefits. Your presence here is evidence of your interest in getting the latest information on the hog business— information that will help you in cutting down costs.. The market or price aspects of the hog enterprise cannot be mapped out as definitely as the productive program. We know that hogs can be immunized against cholera with quite certain results We know that certain combinations of feeds are more economical than others. It is more difficult, however, to figure out how hog producers are going to react to changes in hog prices or! changes in the size of the corn crop. Just because the problem is a little harder is hardly reason enough why it should not be given consideraiion even if, as the program reads, "I May Be Wrong." Hog Prices Go In Cycles When I have discussed the hog price situation before you hog producers at previous meetings here at the College, I have shown you </seg>
            <seg id="p592">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE several charts. A year or more ago at the "Rooters Day" meeting I showed you a chart, which indicated that hog prices tend to go in cycles — up for two or three years and then downward for a some - what similar period. I have a similar chart to show you today. Any of you who were at the "Rooters Day" meeting in the fall of 1928 may recall that I mentioned that hog prices not only tended to move in cycles but that the cycles tended to alternate — a major cycle followed by a minor cycle, a minor cycle by a major, and so on. The last complete cycle, started from a low point in late 1923,. moved upward to 1926 and then downward to a low in early 1928. It was a major cycle, that is, there was a wide range in prices between the low and the high points. One would expect from a study of the past that the cycle we are now in would be a minor one — with a much narrower range from low to high. We are far enough along in the cycle, and know enough about current hog production, to feel with some degree of certainty that history is going -to repeat Itself and that the present cycle will be less pronounced than the preceding one. Hog Men In and Out of Business Why does hog production and market receipts vary so markedly as to result in the alternating periods of advancing and declining prices? For one thing, feed production and prices vary and it is not always profitable to feed hogs. Another factor in the situation is that periods of hog profits stimulate producers to farrow more pigs than can be marketed at a. profit later. In other words, the majority of producers are more influenced by current profits or losses when plan - ning future operations than by prospective returns obtainable when their products will be ready for market. What is the present hog supply situation and what about pros - pects for the year ahead? Based on the information we have avail - able, no material change in hog receipts — either up or down — appears likely for 1930. The pig surveys even though they may not be en - tirely accurate, are the best means we have at hand for estimating what future hog supplies are going to be. The pig crops — spring and fall — of 1929 furnish the hogs that will be marketed in the present hog year (November, 1929 — October, 1930). For the Cornbelt States, the 1929 spring pig crop was reported to be 6 per cent smaller than the 1928 crop, while the 1929 fall crop was reported as 4 per cent larger than the fall pig crop of 1928. The combined 1929 pig crops in the Cornbelt were reported as 3 per cent smaller than the 1928 crops. By checking survey reports of previous years we have found a tendency to underestimate the pig crops in the Cornbelt. If the same tendency to underestimate prevailed in 1929, the total pig crop for 1929 was possibly a little larger than the 1928 pig cropr- That would mean a few more hogs to be marketed in the 1929-30 hog year (be - ginning November 1) than in the year just past. </seg>

"I May Be Wrong" in what I have just said about the hog market situation. Even so, I am firmly of the opinion that study of the price </seg>
            <seg id="p594">REPORT OK NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE situation is to be preferred to blind guessing. A leading business service carries on its cover page, the slogan, "A Man's Judgment Is No Better Than His Information." We still lack considerably of hav - ing all the information we need in studying prices and price trends, but that should not be an excuse for not using the information avail - able. MR. HILDEBRAND: I know we have all enjoyed this talk of Mr. Hedges'. It was interesting to me for the reason that I believe the time Is arriving, or has already arrived, when any hog raiser of any size can pay attention to charts of this kind. The reason I men - tioned this was that I just happened to see that hogs should be selling today at $10.45 if they are selling in line with 96 commodities which the farmer buys. I have a chart, not one that has been kept up as long as this one Mr. Hedges has, which shows the daily average of hogs in Chicago since January, 1924. I get a lot of pleasure out of just watching these prices go up and down and seeing how that price looks from year to year. I think we are going to have to figure on that. Does someone have a question? QUESTION: When should we get out of the hog business? MR. HILDEBRAND: The time to get out of the hog business is ' when hogs are high. You should get in when they are low. You know what happened on Wall Street just recently. Everyone went in when stocks were high and you know just what they experienced. Probably this is what is bringing about the fact that they are going to permit us to trade in hog futures the same as we do in wheat, corn, and other commodities. The time may come when you can buy your hogs In the fall for future delivery and know what prices you will be able to get for them. Possibly we will be wrong as many times as we are right. I think we must pay attention to production if we are going to make a go of the hog business. You know how much lard has been kept In storage — millions of pounds. I wonder if there are not a number of hog men who are permitting themselves to use substitutes for lard when they should be using their own commodity. That is one of the things that has been brought out by the National Livestock and Meat Board. . The substitutes advertised are probably affecting the hog market just as much as anything else. Large hogs contain lots of lard. This must be gotten rid of some way. I be - lieve our hog market would be better if we would use this lard and not the substitutes. The next speaker on the program needs no introduction here. He always has a lot of good looking girls -for you to demonstrate to you and your good wives the advantages of various cuts of beef and how to use some of the cuts that you have in the past discarded as not fit for human food. With these girls demonstrating under . his tutorship he has always been able to prove to you that these cuts are worth while. Professor Loeffel will address you now on "Evaluating Hog Feeds." </seg>
            <seg id="p595">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS* ASSOCIATION EVALUATING HOG FEEDS; i WM. J. LOEPPBL Mr. Hlldebrand, ladies, and gentlemen: This is going to be a wolf in sheep's clothing if you expect me to talk about meat, for I am going to talk about a different subject. Being a meat man, I know you will pardon me for having my notes on a piece of wrapping paper. Alfalfa Hay for Sows The subject given to me is "Evaluating Hog Feeds." Alfalfa hay is approximately a maintenance ration for hogs; that is, you can take mature sows and practically maintain them on alfalfa. Mr. Snyder at North Platte perhaps has done more work with alfalfa for hogs than any other man in this country that I know about.! He has had best results feeding it in racks. He has found that superior to any preparation method he has used. These experiments were carried on ten or fifteen years ago. At those times the preparation methods were more costly than they are today. By grinding hay, there Is no question but what you reduce the waste. That jis an important con - sideration these days when alfalfa hay Is a rather costly item. I think there is more justification for grinding alfalfa hay and feeding it ground today than there was ten years agoL I would say that alfalfa meal is a valuable constituent In these mixtures. For the young pigs, I think there Is a limit to the amount of alfalfa you want to put In. The problem of deciding between various feeds is one which con - stantly faces the feeder. The feeding value of a feed may be de - termined by two methods. First, there is the chemical analysis. This is the simplest method. Samples are submitted to a chemist and In a comparatively short time he submits a report of the percentage of crude protein, fat, ash, crude fiber, and either the nitrogen free ex - tract or carbohydrates. Crude protein is the essential muscle-building material In the feed. Without It, life cannot exist. It is generally the most expen - sive nutrient. It Is frequently the limiting factor In cornbelt rations. For example, If someone gave you enough parts j to build 1,000 auto - mobile engines and only enough bolts to put together 500, 500 en - gines is all you could build. A pig may have enough carbohydrates, fats, and mineral matter In his ration to gain a {pound a day. How - ever, if he has protein enough to gain only one-half pound a day, one-half pound is all he will gain. Fat Is a valuable constituent In a ration. It may be used for the production of energy or may be used for the production of body fat. Too much fat Is undesirable because It becomes unpalatable and also depresses the digestibility of the entire ration. One pound of fat is two and one-fourth times as valuable, from the standpoint of </seg>
            <seg id="p596">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE producing energy, as a pound of carbohydrate. For example, you can secure two and one-fourth times as much energy from a pound of butter as from a pound of sugar or starch. Ash, or mineral matter, of course, is important in all rations. It is used by the growing animal to produce bone and has many other important functions in the body. Certain feeds, such as milk, tank - age, and the legumes, are rich in mineral matter, particularly calcium, and therefore where rations comprise quantities of these feeds, min - eral requirements are usually adequately supplied. Crude fiber is the woody material in the feeds. It is of low digestibility to the pig and, therefore, not nearly so valuable as for the animals with four stomachs, the steer and the sheep. A hog feed which contains a high percentage of crude fiber, then, is objectionable from the standpoint that it provides 'a high percentage of material of low digestibility. Nitrogen free extract is comprised of the starches and the sugars. They are used for energy production and may be stored up as body fat when present in excess of the animal's requirements for energy. It is the cheapest nutrient which we can produce on our Nebraska farms, being particularly abundant in all grains. In some cases car - bohydrates will also be quoted, and bear in mind that the crude fiber plus the nitrogen free extract is equivalent to the carbohydrates. Chemical Analysis Does Not Give Digestibility The nutrients which the chemist' determines are the crude nu - trients. Occasionally feeders believe that they refer to digestible nutrients, but this is not the case. In fact, the wide variation in di - gestibility Is one of the principal weaknesses of the chemical analysis. The cheapness and quickness with which a chemical analysis can be made are the strongest points in its favor. Its weakness lies in the fact that it is merely an approximation of the actual feeding values. It does indicate, of course, something concerning the feeding value of a feed. The Nebraska law requires that the chemical analysis of the feed be stated on the feed sack. Occasionally a man will write in and say: "I have purchased some pig meal and the analysis given on the sack states 20% crude protein,- 7% fiber, 6% fat, 48% nitrogen free extract, 55% carbohydrate. This totals over 100% and can't be right." The difficulty is that carbohydrates and nitrogen free extract represent more or less of a duplication: . The nitrogen free extract plus the crude fiber is equivalent to the carbohydrates. Keep in mind that this represents the crude chemical analysis and not the digestible material. Feeding trials are the most accurate means of determining the nutritive value of a feed. They are very costly; however, and require more or less time to complete them. From the vast number of feed - ing trials which have been conducted by the Nebraska and other ex - periment stations in the past, some general statements may be made </seg>
            <seg id="p597">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATION regarding the comparative feeding value of many of our common feeds. Of all the common grains, we may look upon corn as the basic feed and arbitrarily give it the value of 100%. Barley 90% as Valuable as Corn Barley is a feed which has increased in importance in Nebraska remarkably during the past year. The Nebraska Experiment Station has carried on a number of years' work with this feed and, summar - izing our results, we find that ground barley is approximately 90% as valuable as shelled corn for hog feed. In other words, 100 pounds of ground barley is equivalent to 90 pounds of shelled corn. It is very desirable to reduce all of our grains to the] price per 100 pounds basis rather than to the bushel because of the difference in weight per bushel. I feel that the feeders in western Nebraska and eastern Colo - rado have a distinct advantage because of the fact that they speak of price per hundred pounds rather than per bushel, thereby making direct comparisons much simpler. With barley and oats, considerable attention must be paid to the test weight per! bushel. It is a well demonstrated fact that grains with a high test weight are more nutri - tious than light, chaffy grains. In fact, the test weight may explain some of the differences which are reported by different experiment stations working with the same feed. - Oats Not as Valuable as Barley ■ Oats are approximately 60% as valuable as corn for rattening pigs. Their value for growing and breeding animals, is somewhat higher, due to their high content of excellent quality protein together with considerable quantities of ash, or mineral matter. Their bulkiness. however, makes them a rather questionable feed In the ration of fattening pigs. Ground Wheat Is a Good Hog Feed Wheat, because of its price, does not frequently interest us as a hog feed. Occasionally the price of wheat is such, however, that its use as feed is economical. Ground wheat is slightly more efficient than corn. In fact, summarizing a number of feeding trials, ground wheat is 103% as efficient as corn for fattening! hogs. Wheat shorts is approximately equal to corn as a hog feed. Ground rye is approximately 90% as valuable as corn. Rye fre - quently causes disturbances of one kind or another where fed to young pigs. Therefore, I should suggest where it is fed at all, it should be fed to fattening hogs, and preferably should be | fed with some more palatable feed, such as corn or barley. Protein Feeds Vary In Feeding Value Of the high protein feeds, we generally consider tankage as a basis, because of its ready availability and because of the abundance </seg>
            <seg id="p598">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE of work which has been done with it. In producing 100 pounds of gain, 100 pounds of tankage saves or replaces approximately 500 pounds of corn, which means that ordinarily if you can buy 100 pounds of tankage for less than the price of 500 pounds of shelled corn, its purchase 1b a sound investment. I have frequently heard Dr. McCampbell of the Kansas Agricul - tural College state, that. 1 pound of tankage is equivalent to 2 gallons of skimmed milk as pig feed. We have, of course, the old rule that 100 pounds of skimmed milk is worth one-half the price of corn per bushel. Buttermilk is equivalent to skimmed milk, and whey is half as valuable as skimmed milk per hundred pounds. Linseed and cottonseed meal may be used in the hog ration in protein supplementary mixtures. The results are frequently rather disappointing when these feeds are used as the sole source of protein. Mixtures of these meals together with tankage have given excellent results at the Nebraska and other experiment stations. The efficiency of the mixture over tankage alone is sometimes described to variety of proteins. Use Available Information in Selecting Rations With the various protein supplements on the market, it Is rather difficult to suggest the feeding value. There are those who would com - pare various feeds on the basis of their content or on the basis of cost per unit of protein, yet this method is hardly fair since it is a well recognized fact that certain proteins are more efficient than others. So far as the information is available, the feeder should be guided by actual feeding tests. In the absence of feeding tests, he must rely upon chemical analysis, recognizing, of course, the short - comings of the chemical analyses in arriving at the true value of the feed. QUESTION: Do you have any experimental work on the feeding of millet and cane? This is getting to be quite a crop in southwestern Nebraska. MR. LOEFFEL: We' have done no work with- those feeds at this station. I think work at the southwestern station shows that the grain sorghum is about 90% as valuable as corn. MR. HILDEBRAND: I know we have all enjoyed this talk by Professor Loeffel. He always brings a message worth while at these meetings. We are especially favored this morning in that we have a pro - fessor from one of our neighboring states to our north who is going to address us on a subject that is certainly timely just now when the 1930 hog crop is in the making.

            <seg id="p600">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The better than average brood sow selected by testing, produces In one litter 8 pigs which at a conservative weight of 250 pounds total one ton of pork. At 10 cents per pound the sow has been responsible' for $200.00 worth of pork from one litter. This goal is within the reach of any intelligent and ambitious hog man whether he is raising grades or purebreds. Restated, these figures are: Value of Product Inferior cow . $ 90.00 Superior cow . 202.50 Inferior sow ; ! 112.50 Superior sow . 200.00 No dairy cow can produce more than a year's production in 12 months, but many sows produce two litters per year. Of course not all tested sows farrow twice a year, but it is easily possible for a farmer to grow half as many fall pigs as spring pigs. In proportion to the cost of growing and feeding her, the sow, when she is ready to go to market, sells at a much higher price than the dairy cow. This is not an argument for sows against cows. It is simply an effort to show that testing sows is even more profitable than testing cows. Are we agreed upon the advisability of testing sows? Several Methods Can lie Used If so, the next question is how to do it. There are at least four methods. The simpler ones are only reasonably accurate while the most accurate method is rather complicated, being a logical plan only for those breeders with high-class purebred herds. Any man who owns two or more brood sows can not afford to neglect to follow the simplest one of these plans. : It is just as applic - able for grade as for purebred sows. By weighing each litter separately at 60 days of age the sows responsible for the greatest production of pork can be identified. In - ferior sows can be fattened for market and gilts to be kept in the herd should be picked from these heaviest litters. This plan in a few years' time will make a herd of either grade or purebred sows much more profitable than the ordinary method of selection. No outlay of money and very little labor is required. Litters are marked at farrow - ing and a milk scale can be used to weigh the pigs. Indiana Farmer Produces More Than n Ton of Pork Per Sow That this system will accomplish results is shown by the experi - ence of Claude Mangas of Randolph County, Indiana. Four or five years ago, he began weighing the pigs of each litter and selecting gilts from the heaviest litters. Previously he had picked gilts from the litters having the largest number of pigs. However, he found that there was a big difference in the two methods and that weight </seg>
            <seg id="p601">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS 1 ASSOCIATION rather than number of pigs was much the most accurate basis. When starting this method of selection, he found that! there was a big dif - ference in the weights of litters of pigs when 180 days of age. Seven of the sows in the herd weaned 9 pigs each. The heaviest of these litters weighed 2,144 pounds while the lightest totaled only 1469 pounds. There was a difference in pork value of |$ 8 7. 7 5 between these two 9 pig litters. The difference of 675 pounds in market weight was due to the feeding ability of the pigs which in a large measure was a characteristic Inherited from the sows. Mr. Mangas selected and improved his herd by keeping gilts from the heaviest litters. In five years 'time, he had made remarkable progress. In 1«928 he won the Indiana pork production championship by growing 22,372 pounds of pork from 11 sows 1 . This is the official weight of the pigs when they were 180 days old. ] The average weight cf pork per sow was 2,034 pounds. Mr. Mangas self-feeds his pigs during the summer, getting them on the market in the fall when prices are high. Any hog raiser can duplicate the success of this Hoosier farmer It is not necessary to enter a Ton Litter or Pork Production contest to get these results; Of course the breeding stock must have the basic characteristics of high prolificacy, good feeding ability, and rapid - ity of gains, if. selection is to be effective. As long as six centuries ago, people realized the truth of the axiom that is is impossible to make a silk purse from a sow's ear. Minnesota Hog Men Do Well Pork Production contests were started in Nebraska. You know the value of this plan of testing sows and the results which have been secured in the Cornhusker state. Let me mention what we have done in Minnesota in three years' time. Our first year in the Pork Pro - duction work was 1927. The winner that year raised in 180 days an average of 1,941 pounds of pork per sow from 6 sows. In 1928 the highest record was from a herd of 10 sows with an average weight per litter of 2,098 pounds. The best record of all was made in 1929 when 11 sows showed an average weight per litter, when pigs were 180 days old, of 2,222 pounds. John Nahrgang owns our most consistent Pork Production herd. He has been in the work each of the three years. In 1927, he was seventh; In 1928, first; and In 1929, third. The first year, his aver - age was 1,415 pounds of pork per. Utter. The second year 2 098 pounds and in 1929, 1,987 pounds of pork at 180 days. He says he has made more money from hogs the past three: years and has had a lot more pleasure out of it than in all his previous farming ex - perience. ■ ■ In 1929, the five highest herds in the Minnesota Pork Production work averaged 11 sows.

Where Are You? In the Top Five or Near the Bottom Five? Ton litter work has been a successful project in Minnesota for 9 years. For the past three years we have emphasized the Pork Pro - duction contest more than the Ton Litter work because we feel that it has the more accurate basis of the two projects. Either of these methods provide a splendid method for testing brood sows. Fast Gaining Pigs Make the Profit What about the cost of gains of these pigs? Experimental work proves that the most rapid gaining pigs in 99 cases out of 100 make the cheapest pork. R. C. Wasson, the winner in the Pork Production Contest in 1929, had a feed cost, not including pasture, of only 4.3 cents per pound of gain. The pigs he marketed sold for $9.10 a hundred. We know from farm cost ac - counts in one of the best of southern Minnesota counties that individ - ual farmers who raise hogs have Invested in every 100 pounds of pork marketed from $5.00 to $15.00. Some of them never can make any money on hogs regardless of how high the market price goes. Sow Testing Stations Established The most accurate of all sow testing methods is the Record of Performance Plan. Two years ago the Iowa Experiment Station began to test out American hogs, using a plan quite similar to the Danish method. To date they have fed pigs from approximately 50 litters. The Minnesota and Wisconsin Stations and the United States De - partment of Agriculture fed . litters of pigs according to the Record of Performance plan in. 1929. Interest in this work is Increasing rapidly and several more states will be offering to breeders, facilities for testing out their herds in 1930. Already, breeders having tested stock for sale are finding a great demand for it. The National Swine Grower's Association endorsed the Record of Performance plan in 1928. A committee working under the direc - tion of this Association is supervising the operation of the project. The members of this committee are: Guy Bush —Greenfield, Iowa J. M. Coyner : Madison, Wisconsin . H. H. Klldee ', Ames, Iowa .A. D. McKee Creston, Iowa E. W. Sheets- Washington, D. C. A. P. Sinex Cudahy, Wisconsin E.F.

Greater benefit to the business will probably result from this project than from all other methods of improvement in the history of American swine raising. American Hogs Grow Faster Than Danish, Hut Eat More It is Interesting to get an indication of how we stand as com - pared with Denmark by lining up our results with theirs. While there is yet too little data on American hogs toj make an accurate average, we can at least get some idea of our situation. One of the feeding stations recently established in Denmark is located at Hong. The figures in Table I are taken from the report of this Station for 1926-27; leaflet No. 26, lowa Agricultural Experiment Station and report H-40 from the Minnesota Experiment Station.

These figures from American Stations can not be considered re - liable averages because too few pigs have been tested, but they give us an indication that our pigs grow faster even if they take more feed to make gains than do Danish pigs. There are big differences even among the best strains of pure - bred hogs such as were fed in this project. At Minnesota the slowest daily gain per pig was 1.14 pounds; the most rapid, 1.48 pounds. The largest quantity of feed to produce 100 pounds of pork was .419.38 pounds; the smallest, 342.20. This demonstrates the saving , which can be made if the cheapest gaining strains j can be located and their numbers increased while the least profitable strains are being discarded. Bear in mind that all this' work has been done using only the very best of purebred hogs. Leading breeders have been co - operating with the Experiment Stations in this testing work.

There is no wish to increase the number of hogs grown in the United States. In some years we have been producing too many. However, this plan, if suc - cessful, will yield more dollars per hog which is a result all hog raisers will welcome. I want to urge each one of you to make more money out of your hogs than you are now doing by using one of these testing methods. There is plenty of proof that any and all of the methods are highly profitable. n» mT^ -- ■ ' ' ' IBB^Kft^Kl JB^B I . ■■•• . - Q &gt; ■ ' I sfl Bui IH^HSB Snnitary Methods Produce Pork Economically MR. HILDEBRAND: It was a privilege as well as a pleasure to have Professor Ferrin with us today and have him give us his new basis for testing brood sows which has certainly been worth while. We have ! one more speaker before our noon-day luncheon. It has been my privilege to be out over the state with this young man. He has the reputation of being the peppy animal husbandry extension man. In looking over this program, I think his reputation has some - thing to do with the subject, "A Goal to Shoot At." He is the last speaker on the program before noon, so he has a lot to shoot at. I think there is logic in this subject that has been assigned to him, and now he is going to shoot at all of us. Mr. Waggener. </seg>
            <seg id="p605">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATION A GOAL TO SHOOT AT O. O. WAGGENER Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen: I just had a hunch that some of these other big speakers might take a little more time; than was assigned to them so I thought perhaps I wouldn't have very much time to talk. This does not please me very much, as I like to talk. Anyway, I've decided to hand out my talk in written form. In fact, 1 doubt if I could give this talk in as interesting a style as : it will be on paper. You all heard Professor Ferrin talk about efficiency test for sows, and the thing that I was going to tell you about this morning was an efficiency test for sows and hog men. You all know about the Pig Crop Contest. On these sheets of paper that the boys are passing out you will notice how the men finished this year. I am going to call on a few |of these men who happened to be high in this contest and let them give my talk for me. It's a peculiar thing, but Honor Ochsner was able to win this contest with sixty-eight men competing this year and seventy-two com - peting last year. At the Master Farmers' Banquet, a good-natured breeder from up near the river jokingly remarked that "It wasn't Honor Ochsner, it was his pigs that won that contest." Technically, he was correct. Actually, he was not, for even as prize fighters need good managers in order to win bouts, so do pigs require good man - agement in order to win pig crop contests — yes, better still, iii order to show any profit at all. There is little doubt but that there are numerous herds in the state that are for all practical purposes as well bred as Ochsner's. It's true he took advantage of j good breeding to - gether with whatever is to be gained by cross-breeding. But neither breed nor breeding alone can win a contest of this nature. One man who knows Mr. Ochsner says his place is ideally equipped for producing pork. And so it is, but there are numerous other Nebraska farms fully as well equipped. Good equipment is highly important. Every man who knows hogs knows that, but equip - ment alone will not win a pig crop contest. No. it wasn't equipment, it wasn't breeding, it wasn't feeding, it wasn't alone the fact that he was careful to avoid losses by disease. That any one of these is essential and important,! no one can deny. But that any one of them alone was responsible for Ochsner's success is, as most of us will recognize, much too narrow a viewpoint! of his outstanding accomplishment. As I see it, Ochsner was able to win this contest principally because he himself is a real manager. He knows how to organize and combine every one of the numerous essential elements which are required to make a success of the hog business and, what's more, he does it. Let's hear what Honor has to say about his winning. Mr. Ochsner, liow did you do it? </seg>
            <seg id="p606">I REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE HONOR M. OCHSNER: I will make this just as brief as Mr. Waggener said lie was going to. I feel rather ashamed of my name up here topping the list with the record of 1,665 pounds after learn - ing that men over in Iowa and other states are producing 2,000 pounds per litter. I will just say, as Professor Ferrin said before, breeding is one of the main things, and selection. I have been following a plan of cross-breeding, which I think is a satisfactory plan. You get your breeding and then follow this with a good selection of type and mark - etable hogs. These hogs that I bad this year were crossbred hogs. I had purebred Poland China sows crossed with purebred Duroc boars. I find that this is a very good cross. There probably are others that would be just as good, but I believe this is a good one. I sold all my pigs in September. I got the packers to run a killing and cutting test on them. I do not have the record as to how they killed and cut out. This will be available later. MR. WAGGENER: the next man on the list, Mr. J. E. Floyd, happens to be a Chester White breeder from out in Goaper County, Me isn't with us today, but if you were to go to his farm north of Smithfield, you would be impressed by two things — clean ground and management. Mr. Floyd's record would show the importance of these two things. Next we find Mr. A. N. Christiansen, a Duroc breeder north of Bradshaw. Christiansen placed eighth, last year. This year he was third. He displays confidence in those good-natured red brood sows and they in turn have confidence in him. He talks to them and they talk back. When I was there last spring he asked one how many pigs she was going to have and she replied with eleven satisfied grunts. The sow, I think, was honest but her mathematics was poor, because she really had twelve. There's only one thing about hog raising that Mr. Christiansen hasn't learned and that's how to keep them from having so many pigs. . That's one of the problems, as most of you will agree, that is seldom faced by any except the very best of hog men. To the average man, it's the least of his worries. Mr. Fred Rehmeier of Cass County placed eighth. He is another Chester White breeder. If Mr. Rehmeier is in the audience, I should like to have him tell us how he has been able to place In the Nebraska Pig Crop Contest. Fred is another of those consistent winners who never fails to raise a real pig crop. It's my highest ambition to some - day know some one thing — no matter what — as well as Rehmeier knows his white hogs. Fred's greatest problem Is keeping the breed- Ing stock from getting too fat — a problem which most good hog men with good hogs often encounter, and one which it is really difficult for a generous man who feeds well balanced rations to solve. MR. REHMEIER: When I sent in my sheet last spring I should have had 123 pigs instead of 93. I saved 87. I should have saved at least a hundred. I put some of the hogs out in pasture. Some of them X kept inside. It's, an awful big job. I suppose I could have got a </seg>
            <seg id="p607">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATION little more weight on these pigs. I don't think I am an expert at the business at all. but I enjoyed working with Mr. Waggener and listen - ing to what he said. MR. WAGGENER: I see Mr. W. C. Eatonj in the crowd. Mr. Eaton produced 1,309 pounds of pork per litter. How did you man - age to do this, Mr. Eaton? MR. EATON: I just listened to you and did what you said. MR. WAGGENER: Folks, it's our job to listen to you. We get more out of these contests than the men get from us. We get more good from the good hog men of this state than they get. Down in Cass County there is a good Hampshire breeder. He is a tall, good - looking gentleman. He managed to raise 1,292 pounds of pork per litter this year. MR. OREN M. POLLARD: This Is' the first! year I ever entered the contest. It's really something new to me, Since I came up here, I think I will be about as enthusiastic next year as Mr. Waggener has" been the last two or three years. I did not send in my feed records I should have, but about harvest time the man who helped me left and I had to finish the wheat harvesting alone. [ Then I took a trip and so did not keep the record accurate. I always run the sows on grain pasture when they farrow. Just about the time I got ready to plant corn I brought them up by the house and put them on alfalfa pasture. MR. WAGGENER: I thank all of you men for coming up and helping me. There are many things the Pig Crop Contest has taught us. There are also many things which it has taught those who have entered. It will be continued during the coming year. Any hog man in the state with six or more sows is eligible to enter. | There is no cost to It. The simple records are furnished free by the College of Agricul - ture. If you want to study your own business, if you are anxious to know how you, as a hog man and manager, compare to other hog men, if you want to find your leaks and stop them, write to the col - lege or ask your county agent for an entry card into the 1930 Pig Crop Contest. Entries must be made, however, before the first sow farrows and every brood sow on the farin must be entered. It's a record of your entire herd, not on a single litter — a test of your management, not of your luck. </seg>

            <seg id="p614">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE CATTLE PROGRAM O. O. WAGGENER, Presiding MR. WAGGONER: The first thing we have this morning is a lit - tle sample of the National Western Stock Show. Since Professor Gramlich is going to the National Western, we are using him as Ex - hibit A, the best exhibit that Nebraska is going to send to Denver. PROFESSOR H. J. GRAMLICH: As Mr. Waggoner told you, these animals are going to the National Western at Denver, and he asked that I say just a word about them. I might state that the show opens January 18. Mr. Johnson is loading Tuesday of next week. We have shown animals out there a good many years. The people in western Nebraska are especially interested in the show. In fact, I think I am safe in saying that the Denver show will see people from half of the state of Nebraska. One man from up around Stanton sends a carload of Hereford bulls. Another man will have a carload of fat steers there. Mr. Claussen sends a carload of fat barrows each year. In addition to the show, sales of livestock are. held there too. We have tremendous' numbers of Nebraska people who go extensively to buy cattle for the feed lots. We, here in Nebraska, feel that the Denver show is pretty much a Nebraska show. It does not compete with our State Fair, in a sense, of course, because the State Fair represents the whole state. Nevertheless, it is a show that is of value to the whole state. Mr. Johnson represents the Swedish part of this first stunt which Mr. Waggoner has arranged. Take your hat off so they tell you from a steer, Charlie. Mr. Johnson has been fitting our cattle and taking care of them for a good many years and really needs no introduction to you. Notice this black steer which Mr. Johnson is holding. He weighs about 1,160 at the present time. There is a steer that would be quite comparable in weight to most steers after they have been held too long. This year the beef men say the cattle are fine. They are better finished, by far, than they were last year. They yield a higher dress - ing percentage. They are better in every respect except one they are too heavy. They weigh 1,025 on foot as finished steers. The orders which the packers receive call for cattle weighing around 800 on foot. Young cattle which weigh so light do not make beef of flavor. I believe flavor doesn't count any more. Most people judge beef by ten - derness instead of flavor. Take, for example, the beef that was served last night. That was from a 10-months' old steer. The beef that you had last night was, in reality, from a calf like the one that Dr. Mc- Campbell spoke about yesterday — creep-fed calves. This calf was a July yearling. I This calf weighs 1,160 and is a right good kind of steer. I will see him In the beef at Denver two weeks from today. I think I can </seg>
            <seg id="p615">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATION tell you how he will look when ribbed open. There will be too much outside fat. There will be plenty of fat through! the lean. When you get to cutting Into the various cuts, there will be a tremendous amount of fat. That steer will produce a carcass which will not do the job. Very frequently cattle like this are superior on foot and are sent East because they can't be used at- Denver. People there do not call for heavy beeves. About three years ago we recall a. steer which we called College Kenyon. This steer was made grand champion j out at Denver. This next steer is a full brother to him. This is not a good steer and he just goes to show the inconsistency of animal breeding. Here's a steer with a yellow streak. Charlie, how did that hap - pen? This is a steer, gentlemen, that is from a cow that produced a number of very good steers. He is an August calf, which makes him a year and about four months old. He weighs 1,190. He is too big. That steer, in his class, will be upwards of 200 pounds heavier than the other steers in the same ring. By packer judges, as well as college professors and all sorts of breeders, we are jumped more often because a steer 1b too large rather than too small. This only shows that times are changing. Here's a steer by the same sire, and is practically the same age. He Is a purebred shorthorn. He is low-down, jblocky steer but pos - essesed of a low back. He weighs about 1,070. Pretty heavy also. He is another August calf. Here Is another steer of the same age — a summer yearling. He again is too heavy, weighing 1,230 pounds. We thought this was a pretty good steer. He placed sixth in a class! of thirty at the Ak - ' Sar-Ben so we didn't take him to the Royal. I He carries too much weight. Here's a calf that is thin. He was calved about the first of March, making him about ten months old. He! is quite a good calf, but too high in the tall. He weighs 760 pounds. .This calf is considerably younger. He weighs 700. He is a last of April calf; low-down, blocky type. This calf is a June 1st calf, was seven months old the first of January and weighed 730 this morning. It may seem impractical to get calves that fat at that age. Under most conditions he prob - ably would not have been crowded that much. Here we have a little six-months' old heifer. We have sold two or three like this at Denver. They make very] desirable carcasses — the kind your butcher, big town or small town, would like to take and cut up. They make just the kind of cuts that people want. That Is one reason why we are experiencing this fall for light beef. That's all the cattle we'll take time to show you this morning. Mr. Derrick, will you show us your horses now? </seg>
            <seg id="p616">REPORT Of NEBRASKA STATE! BOARD OF AGRICULTURE! MR. DERRICK: Good times for; horses are juat about here. Even though most of you are tractor farmers, you are going to have to use horses to some extent. Good horses will always have an advantage over common ones, even though used only for, work purposes. As far as selling is concerned, every fellow who buys a good horse will always be able to sell him and realize a good price for him. (The horses which were going to Denver were brought in and shown). MR. GRAMLICH: These pigs are going to Denver. This first one is a brother to the grand champion at Denver last year. This pig weighs about 220 pounds. There is a prejudice against too much weight in hogs. I can's help but think after the Chicago carcass contest how surprising it is that certain breeds of livestock that are not considered common or popular with the general run of people come out on top. In the hogs, it's the Berkshire breed; cattle it's Aberdeen-Angue; horses, it's Clydes; sheep, it's the Southdowns I am Inclined to think, in the main, that on animals it takes a given amount of feed to produce a certain amount of weight. This is true of calves and I believe it is true of pigs. (The pigs which were going to Denver were exhibited). Professor Weber needs no introduction to you folks. He will show you what he has in the sheep line. PROFESSOR A. D. WEBER: We just brought in a few of our lambs today. This is a Rambouillei ewe lamb that was dropped in February. It will probably weigh at the present time about 110 or 115 pounds. It was first at the State Fair and second at Omaha She is out of the same ewe that the first prize ewe lamb at Kansas City last year was. This little Southdown is a wether, dropped in March. He hasn't won anything so far. He is about the right weight for a light wether show. This Southdown Is out of a yearling ewe that was champion at Omaha last year. Now here's another Rambouillet. The Southdown is English The Rambouillet is a French Merino. The breed was brought to France from Spain and forms the foundation for over half of the sheep in this country. They are a dual-purpose braed of sheep. One reason why the Southdown is not popular is because of Its very light bone Southdown ewes will average around six pounds of wool while Ram - bouillet ewes average around 14 pounds. The Southdown is a small breed. In interbreed competition the Southdown is hard to beat be - cause it is almost the ideal mutton type. Occasionally a Shropshire cross will come in for grand championship. MR. O. O. WAGGENER: Weber hailed from Kansas. One of his colleagues told me an incident that happened one day when taking a test. The professor asked him first: "I would like to have you ex - plain to the class why cream costs more than milk." Weber scratched </seg>
            <seg id="p617">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS ASSOCIATION his head and then said, "I think it's because it's harder for the cows to sit on those small bottles." The next man on our program this morning probably a good many of you have seen out in the state. He is 1 -small, but we don't hold that against him. Paul McDill is his name. He has had a lot of trouble keeping track of all these baby beeves. One time when Paul was going to school they were working with a pretty difficult set of fractions. The teacher looked at him and said, "How much is one-sixth of one-sixteenth? " Paul said', "I really don't know, but it isn't enough to worry about." He is going to talk to you on the topic "Where Are We Going in Baby Beef Work?" Mr. McDill. WHERE ARE WE GOING IN BABY BEEF WORK? PAUL McDILL Mr. Waggener, ladies, and' gentlemen: Since my topic is put to me in the form of a question, I will first answer it directly and in a general way, then go into some of the details, j The general answer can be put into four words. We are going forward. Baby Beef club work is growing in Nebraska. Not only are there more boys and girls feeding baby beeves, but they are feeding better baby beeves. This increase in numbers and quality has come about as a steady, healthy growth over a period of several years. During the past year, 1,242 Nebraska boys ) and girls fed one or more baby beeves. These boys and girls sold $158,947.93 worth of baby beeves. These baby beef club members had organized clubs in 49 counties of the state. The field is large and there is still a large percentage of Nebraska boys and girls who have not been reached with 4-H Club work. j When Will We Reach the Climax The question has already been asked, "Where is this baby beef club business going to lead?" I don't know what the maximum num - ber of baby beeves produced by 4-H Club members will be when baby beef clubs reach their peak or when that peak Is going to be reached. But the fact is very evident that this form of 4-H Club work is both popular and profitable. And for anything to be popular for a long time, it must be profitable. Baby Beef Club records have been show - ing reasonable profits. And as long as these records continue to show profits, this type of club project is going to continue to grow in popu - larity. Fairs and Shows Overcrowded The question has been asked by many, "What are we going to do with this increasing production of baby beeves?" At the State </seg>
            <seg id="p618">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE h ai m, the " Umber ° f baby beef entrles has pas8ed our for handling them. At the Ak-Sar-Ben show more calves were entered than there were stalls to tie them in. And so it is at all state and interstate fairs. The fairs do -not want more calves in the 4-H Club exhibits, but they do want better calves. Every boy and girl cannot have a show calf as standards are set up today. What to do with the 4-H Club calves that are not- show calves is one of the problems in the project today. Direct to market before the show calves get there seems to be the answer. * A Sample of the Baby Beeves Fed by Nebraska 4-H Club Boys. Calves Sell at Their Meat Value •11 k V ? af i er the ° alVeS without 8how Qualities are eliminated, there Will be hundreds of calves at the big shows. It is customary to sell these show calves at auction. When the entries were not so large these calves brought a premium over and above their meat value The premium was paid as a matter of sentiment and advertising on the part of the buyers. But now with the numbers large and the club work on a much larger scale, the sentiment factor has decreased considerable. There is still and probably always will be advertising value attached to the act of buying, prize winners. But the bulk of the sales are based pretty close to the actual meat value. The sale then teaches the boys and girls values while an inflated sale is apt to create false ideas. Only the quality of baby beeves that cannot be bought on the market every day should be brought to the show and sold in the auc - tion. And unless these common kind of calves are kept out of the </seg>
            <seg id="p619">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' SASSOCIATION show and auction, the time will come, as it almost did at our State Fair this past year, when the calves will sell under market values. The show phase of the project with its prizes and honors is pri - marily for the purpose of creating interest, providing incentive foi extra effort and as a public advertisement for the project. Baby Beef Work is Educational The real purpose of the Baby Beef Club is to teach the coming generation of farmers the best practices in the selection, feeding, and marketing of beef cattle. And we find many fathers and neighbors changing their feeding practices because of the demonstrations these boys and girls have carried on in their home communities. Four-H Club work has aroused ambitions in the hearts of many boys and girls and has been a factor in carrying! them on to college training and worthy professions, as well as to start many of them into the production of good herds of livestock. The list of these results is already long as aj result of the small amount of club work done a few years ago. With the program on as big a scale as it is today, the results in the future promise to be proportionately greater. A needed addition to our beef cattle 4-H Club program seems to be a type of club activity that will include the problems of breeding herd management. A beef cow club or. something of the kind, the calves from these cows to be creep fed and finished for baby beeves, sold as feeder calves, or in ca.se of heifer calves, grown out for breed- Ing cows to replace the old cow or to increase the size of the boy's breeding herd. Experience is Not Expensive "Well bought is half sold," is just as true with the boy and his calf as it is with Dad and his carload or more of feeding cattle so far as profit goes. But the 4-H Club boy learns at much less expense to himself than Dad did. This is a big problem for the boy when he buys his calf to feed into a baby beef. Often the calf that gives promise of feeding into a show winner costs too much money to take a chance on. This is just the same proposition that the adult feeder is up against. Quite often the less promising feeder stock can be bought at a figure that will return a bigger profit. We believe 4-H Club work is teaching valuable lessons that are going to continue to produce farm profits and happy farmers. MR. WAGGENER: Thank you, Mr. McDill.

If any of you men speak too long, Kiwanls Hill will surely howl and let you know that your time is up. The next man I am going to introduce to you I do not believe will do that. I think he is the man whom you have come to hear this morning our own Professor H. J. Gramlich. FEEDS FEEDERS ARE FEEDING H. J. GRAMLICH Gentlemen, I have a few remarks written this morning on this sheet of paper. Waggener saw the. sheet just a few moments ago and he said, "If you read that paper to these people, I'l shoot you. 1 I had figured upon reading this, but I am not sure that these thoughts would be entirely appropriate. This man Waggener seems pretty fresh this morning, taking shots at all of us. I just think I will get it back on him. You know, he used Ito be a county agent in Colorado. Waggener called a meeting and a certain lady asked him a question. The story Is something like this: The lady asked Mr. Waggener how long eggs should be left under a hen before the process of hatching would be completed. Waggener replied, from 3- to 6 weeks, telling her that that would depend upon whether she desired chickens or ducks. He called another meeting sometime later and upon seeing this lady inquired regarding the outcome of her setting. She replied that as the eggs had not hatched at the end of three weeks and she did not wish ducks, she had sold the eggs. ■ Waggener has called another meeting and I find that he has given me the subject "Feeds Feeders Are Feeding." I shall be forced to read just a little of my paper. I will try to touch upon both sub - jects — the cattle and the feeds. ■ • People do not want big cattle; therefore, it is up to us to supply the market with what it wants. The axiom of trade today is "Give the people what they want." I do not believe that we will ever go back to the popularity for big cattle. This subject is obviously an unusual one. Some may interpret it to be very clear, concise, and practical; others may feel that it was handed to the speaker with the thought that the audience would con - sist of a group of New York stock market operators who had recently retired perforce of unguessed market outcomes and invaded Nebraska's fertile fields in the hope of finding employment pushing a scoop shovel. Undoubtedly that is not the kind of audience assembled in this room today, although probably I here and there throughout the room is an occasional person who felt crafty enough to play the Board and who at this time is quite content to sit unrecognized, unknown, and unheralded in our midst. Should there be some of this class present, I gladly extend the hand of welcome and trust that through </seg>
            <seg id="p621">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS 1 ASSOCIATION close attention to the details of the livestock business you will be able to recoup the losses incurred by investments in stock which proved to be watered rather than live. I Ground Ear Corn Shows No Advantage Over Shelled Corn Nebraska today is at the peak of its livestock feeding activities. Bountiful harvests have been reaped and are garnered about the farmsteads. The problem of disposal of these is being met by the energetic use of pitchfork and scoop shovel. In most sections of the state, corn proved to be such a large crop that temporary cribs were called into use and many farmsteads are dotted with open piles of corn. Observations made during the past few weeks lead me to make the statement that cattle feeders are at this time feeding ground ear corn on a much larger scale than during any previous year. Appar - ently this product is giving satisfaction. With most farms equipped with a tractor, and with grinders pretty well perfected, the job of grinding seems to be relatively simple. In spite of the fact that cattle seem to thrive wonderfully well on ground ear, corn, an experiment conducted at this institution last year failed to show any particular financial advantage in the feeding of ground ear corn over shelled corn. The cattle fed were yearlings past and at the close of the 140 - day feeding period the gains were practically identical and the cost of gains slightly in favor of the lot carried on shelled corn. Experimental work has tended to show that cobs contain relatively little net energy, and apparently the good derived from the feeding of ground corn mixed with ground kernel is one of mechanical advantage, in that, the ration is practically fool proof and it is seldom that a steer is foundered or goes off feed when subjected to it. I j Alfalfa Hay Is Plentiful Men who are short of alfalfa hay are feed ng a protein supple - ment. The shortage of alfalfa which We heard so much about early in the fall has up to date proved to be somewhat mythical as hay today is apparently more abundant and actually is lower in price than it was sometime back. Not a few feeders are buying alfalfa and us - ing it for a protein supplement to ground ear corn. With the recent drop in price of cottonseed cake there is a spread of approximately $14.00 per ton between it and linseed meal. - If you are in need of a protein supplement for cattle, there certainly can be no question but that cottonseed meal will prove to be the more satisfactory buy at the levels indicated. Barley on the Increase . Barley is very rapidly attaining a position of prominence among Nebraska crops. In 1929 we produced, with in the state, two and one - half times as many bushels as were produced per year during the five years preceding. It would seem as though we were finding that </seg>
            <seg id="p622">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OK AGRICULTURE tills valuable crop works into rotations to advantage and is destined . to become one of our major grain crops. If this is the case, what about the value of it as a feed? First of all, on account of the fact that barley is a very hard grain it should always be fed ground. We have tried feeding it whole both dry and soaked, but with only fair results. One will always be reimbursed for the cost of grinding by the results obtained when the product is fed. Barley should not be compared to oats but rather to corn. Oats are bulky and fibrous and while preeminently satisfactory for the growing animal, do not contain enough fat-forming nutrients to justify using in the ration for fattening stock. Barley, on the other hand, is quite comparable to corn. Experimental work with fattening stock has tended to show that ground barley ranges from 90 to 95 per cent as valuable as corn in' the ration. Assuming that considerable barley is produced one certainly would be justified in feeding it in conjunc - tion with corn. Some splendid results have been obtained by feeding a mixture of equal parts ground barley and cracked corn. Most of the time barley is cheaper per pound than corn. In case a person is buying grain it would probably be well to buy corn unless barley is available at a price of not to exceed 85 or 90 per- cent that of corn. It is well to bear in mind that with corn at 70 cents per bushel the cost per one hundred pounds is the same as where the price of barley is 60 cents. Some day I hope we will eliminate the bushel as a unit and in livestock feeding parlance adhere entirely to the one-hundred - pound basis. Then we can very easily compare the several grains and supplements which we have at our disposal. Western Nebraska has already adopted this standard and the sooner the eastern half of the state does, the better. Small Versus Big Cattle ' " '■ Speaking of cattle feeding, there is probably more interest today in cattle than In feeding. We find a marked reaction against heavy cattle. The preference for light beeves has been gradually creeping upon us during the past decade; during the past 6 or 8 months there has been a drastic movement forward in the clamor for little cattle and a resultant wave of unpopularity for the big brute. Choice, well - finished steers weighing 1,400 to 1,500 pounds go begging for bids on our markets at the present time and finally sell late in the day at 12 to 13 cents per pound, while little warmed-up skates of both sexes and all breeds start their dog trot to the scales at 10 minutes after 8 and do so at almost as much per pound as the big beasts. While at the Omaha market recently I observed a load of 1, 500-pound steers which sold late in the day for $12.35. Across the alley was a load of 900-pound steers which had sold early at $12.00. These light cattle had been exposed to corn for 60 days and were a pro - miscuous bunch containing most everything except straight dairy suock. They probably dressed 53 per cent, while the big cattle un - doubtedly would have yielded 10 per. cent more. </seg>
            <seg id="p623">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATION This condition is a tragic one for some. Many of you men have feed yards at home filled with steers weighing from 1,200 to 1.400 pounds and while these beasts are quite content to go on munching your pie, cake, and ice cream, you are turning I gray trying to decide whether to order cars and kiss them goodbye or continue pouring your corn down rat holes. Inasmuch as Nebraska and the cornbelt gen - erally has many acres covered with big, fairly rough steers which have been exposed to corn for 90 days, It does riot look as if the sup - ply of this kind at the markets will become acutely short In the near future. With demand on the part of the buying public centered around the light carcasses and with the few remaining supporters of heavy beef steers, who hail from the sections around New York and Boston where many animals are koshered, rapidly switching over to light cattle. It would seem as though the ownet- cTf big steers which have been fed 90 days might just as well take his medicine, reinvest the money in some green cattle and hope that they will later in the year recoup at least part of the vanished simolians. Experimental work conducted during the past ten years at this institution in which cattle of different ages were fed through 200 - day trials showed very conclusively that those weighing from 1,000 to 1,300 pounds, after having been on corn 90 days, became tremen - dously expensive and inefficient gainers. I doubt If steers which have been on feed 90 days and are at present weighing 1,200 to 1,300 pounds are producing gains at less than 20 cents per pound. If this la the case the market will have to advance at least a dollar per month to justify holding. We know that thin cattle will make efficient util - ization of feed and, accordingly, the policy of revolving the contents of the feed lot is justifiable. Shorter Feeding Periods Now the Practice The day of the long-fed steer is past. As a state we have held an enviable reputation in the East for many years. Purveyors of beef all through that section have been clamorous of Nebraska beeves be - cause throughout the ages we have faithfully poured corn Into bovine speclments until they reached the stage of ripeness which satisfied the taste, pocketbook, and prejudice of the Easterner. In doing this, undoubtedly many feeders have "paid the price!" While it is quite an honor to top the market with long-fed cattle, see your name in the dally paper and learn that your beasts were good enough to go East on foot for fancy trade purposes, yet when you I pay a heavy penalty for this, you cannot afford' to continue following the game. It looks very much as the feeders of heavy and medium | weight cattle would of necessity, be forced to a shorter feeding period or else a more lib - eral use of roughage during the first half of the period. The cattle feeder who has fared reasonably well during the past year is the one who has been able to use his own crops to advantage. Thr speculative feeder who has had to buy both grain and roughage </seg>
            <seg id="p624">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATEl BOARD OK AGRICULTURE has operated on such a close margin that his fun has been very ex - pensive. The economy of producing gain Is bound to continue to be a big factor. You gentlemen are not equipped to weigh feed and livestock as we do at. the experiment station. I feel that a part of the justi - fication for our existence lies in the fact that we can devote a good deal of time to details and supply you with information regarding the cost of gains where different rations are used and different classes of animals fed. You are feeding livestock primarily to make money therefrom. You are interested in producing gains economically and tn feeding classes of animals which give promise of being profitable when marketed. Should Equalize Receipts for several years we have given serious consideration to the m of equalizing the supply of fat stock at the markets so as to get away from the tendency to glut at periods and run short of sup - ply at others. Our customers eat just as much meat one day as an - other. We can never hope to have a stable set of livestock markets so long as we continue to plan feeding operations in such ways as to cause periods of very heavy receipts and again times when receipts are very light. We are at this time going through a period of very heavy receipts at the major markets. The market price paid for hogs tells the story. You cuss the packers, but are they entirely to blame? When our markets can be supplied with an even flow of fat stock throughout the year we will undoubtedly find a much more stable set of prices being paid for these animals, and furthermore, our customers in the cities who buy retail cuts of meat will be happier because the cost of tie product will vary but little from time to time. MR. WAGGENER: Do you have any questions that you would like to ask Professor Gramllch on the talk he has just covered? QUESTION: Have you conducted any experiments with feeding minerals to cattle? PROFESSOR GRAMLICH: We have not worked with minerals in Nebraska. We have alfalfa available in practically all sections. Alfalfa is high in minerals and we have felt that the minerals were quite well taken care of. QUESTION: What minerals would you use? PROFESSOR GRAMLICH: This is open to debate. Steamed bone meal or ground limestone might prove helpful. We have not gone very far into this mineral problem. QUESTION: Where feeding alfalfa or corn, is it necessary, or would it pay, to feed oil meal or cottonseed meal? </seg>
            <seg id="p625">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATION . ■ PROFESSOR GRAMLICH: We are asked that a good many times. Usually the addition of a protein supplement to corn and alfalfa will increase the finish and sale price of cattle. At the same time, it will increase the cost of 100 pounds gain, especially if you figure what your feeds raised on the farm are worth. If you want to get cattle finished in a hurry, the use of cottonseed meal is justifiable. If keeping on feed a long time, your gain will undoubtedly be made with just the simple corn and alfalfa ration. MR. WAGGENER: We all have to take our hats off to Professor Gramlich for one thing. Very often our hindsight is very much bet - ter than our foresight. Those of us here in this institution appreciate the fact that ten years ago Professor Gramlicji began advocating lighter cattle. We will have to take our hats oft to Professor Gram - lich for having seen that condition so long before it arrived. I know. you are interested in our cattle feeding experiments. I am going to ask Professor Thalman to. take a few minutes to explain what he is doing. RAY R. THALMAN: Folks, I guess I am jo make a talk, but there will be one thing about it, you won't criticise me for taking too long. There is no use telling you that we are using lighter cat - tle this winter and we are going to keep on using lighter cattle. Our work this winter is planned with lighter cattle— on a cow and calf basis. Some work has been done on wintering calves under western conditions. When these calves are sold, where do they go? Some of them are shipped to men in the western part of the state to go on pasture for some time. A large percentage of j them go to eastern Nebraska, western Iowa, and all over the cornbelt to be carried through the winter on cheap feeds. You can't put a lot of high priced feed in these calves and expect to make money on them when you put them on feed. The problem in eastern Nebraska is that of utilizing cheaper feeds and roughages available on the farms and try - ing to market the cattle at a time when they are carrying cheap gains. Some of the questions foremost In the cattle feeder's mind at the present time are those questions regarding the wintering of stock calves under eastern Nebraska conditions. Unfortunately, there is lit - tle or no experimental work upon which to base our opinions, and, as a result, the Nebraska Station has planned this year's work with the thought in mind of furnishing reliable dataj to the calf feeder. Some of the questions we hope to answer with this year's work are as follows: 1. What does it cost to carry stock calves through the winter under eastern Nebraska conditions? 2. Does it pay to buy calves in the fall and winter them, or is It better to buy in the spring and pay the premium? </seg>
            <seg id="p626">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 3. What rations available in eastern Nebraska are the best suited to the wintering of stocker calves? 4. Is it possible to market corn stalks through calves? 5. What does it cost to grind roughages for calves and does it pay? 6. Can we winter calves economically without alfalfa? 7. What difference, if any, exists between ground corn fod - der and silage as a feed for wintering -calves? 8. Which is the more economical way to dispose of corn stalks, to grind the fodder or to fill the silo? The calves were bought on the Omaha market at around 11 cents. They are all steer calves and graded around good to choice calves They weighed 350 pounds when they went .into the experiment. The plans are to divide this experiment into two phases; first, calf winter - ing project; and second, summer feeding; with the thought in mind of having the cattle finished for a late summer market. The results or the winter work will be available at the spring feeders' meeting on April 18. '. The cattle will be divided into seven lots of 14 steer calves each. They will be fed as follows: Lot 1. Shelled corn and alfalfa. (Full fed). Lot 2. Shelled corn and alfalfa. (Corn limited to 3 . pounds per head daily). Lot 3. Silage and alfalfa. (Alfalfa limited to 3 pounds per head daily). Lot 4. Silage and cottonseed cake. (Cake 1 pound per head dally). Lot 5. Grounc. corn fodder and alfalfa. (Alfalfa limited to 3 pounds per head daily). Lot 6. Ground corn fodder and cottonseed cake. (Alfalfa 3' pounds plus 1 pound cake per head daily). If any of you have any questions, we'd like to hear from you. Plan now to come ip April 18. and hear the results of our winter's work. QUESTION: Can we winter calves economically without alfalfa? ANSWER: Hens at the College we will have to pay around $20.00 for a ton of alfalfa. At Seward the other day men were paying around $15.00. Some may buy it cheaper now, but they will have to pay that' from now on. Alfalfa is quite scarce. QUESTION: Dies it pay to grind feeds and how much does it cost to grind? ANSWER: We are going to have some figures that will tell you just exactly what the cost of grinding' 1 pound of this corn fodder is and what it costs to put 100 pounds of gain on the calves. </seg>
            <seg id="p627">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATION We plan upon putting these calves on either full feed or pas - ture next summer or dry lot feeding proposition. We will have them ready for a Jate summer market. We should like to know what your reaction is to summer feeding on alfalfa. I thank you. MR. WAGGENER: A little incident occurred this morning which reminded me of something which happened back In my boyhood. We used to swim back in Colorado, but we didn't wear swimming suits. One day a bunch of us boys went swimming. We pulled off our clothes and tos B ed them on the bank and jumped in. The other boys were ready to get out before I was: Well, they took all my clothes and hid them. Pretty soon my older brother came up to the swimming pond and brought my clothes to me. ! This morning I re - ceived a call telling me that Mr. Olander would not be able to be with us, due to the sudden illness of his business partner. When I saw Mr. Barney Heide enter the door a few minutes: ago, I felt just like I did when I saw my brother come up with my clothes that day back in Colorado. It was a grand and glorious feeling. I know you all want to hear Mr, Heide say a few words. Mr. Heide. MR. B. H. HEIDE, Secretary, International Livestock Exposition: Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen: As the chairman told you I am placed at somewhat of a disadvantage since I have had abso - lutely no notice of my taking the place of so able aj man as Mr. Olander or. this program. However, I want to say that I consider it a distinct honor and a real privilege to be able to say just [a few words to you If I were to take up the time allotted Mr. Olander. I feel that even Kiwanls Bill would come to life and voice disapproval. Naturally, upon such an occasion as this when I am called on without much warning, I take refuge in the International-Uhe old International which stands for a good many things. I presume I ought to say something about the part Nebraska has played in that great exposition. The Nebraska University has carried off high honors different times. It has won grand championships, but it has done more than that — it has furnished us such men as Professor Grani - lich, who now extends his cooperation. By the way, I might state that he was on one of- the winning teams some years back which took part in the International Intercollegiate judging contest where he ac - corded himself with high honors and carried off liis scholarship. But he is not the only one you have reason to feel proud of. This year one of your feeders furnished the grand champion carload of feeder cattle for the International. In addition to that, Nebraska gave us the new hay king, Mr. M. T. Gillett. Mr. Gillett carried off the highest prize that could go to anyone in the Hay and Grain Department in connection with the showing of hay. Then we have ex-governor Srhallenberger and Mr. Gramllch of the College, Hultine, and others. </seg>
            <seg id="p628">REPORT OF NEBRASKA. STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE I might go on Indefinitely to tell you about Nebraska's part In the ex - position, but I fear that I might be classified as I was sometime ago. JuBt before the. show one of the vaudeville journals, in writing up the International, made |the statement that the International was unique in this respect — thajt it did not have a nut. That is a slang phrase used by vaudeville people. One of my good friends happened to read that article and wro :e to the president of the vaudeville people. The note read as follows^ "Is it possible that these people have not heard of Barney Helde?" Now, I do not want you to classify me in the same fashion. The thought thnt is uppermost in everyone's mind at the present time is, what of 1930? The producer's situation seems to be quite good. At least, if -jve are to judge by the reports that come to us through various channels since the late stock market crash, the farm - er and stockman has not suffered very much through that collapse. It just simply shows again that this class of people, as a rule, has better sense than some of us in the city. The mall order houses send the report that their sales hold suc - cessfully up to normal and in several cases exceed those of the cor - responding period a year ago. The agricultural improvement people make a similar report. The automobile people say that their output is quite as good as it was during the corresponding period a year ago. So then, that leads jis to believe that the producer, as least, is in a fairly satisfactory position. However, he is interested in the con - sumer's wants and, naturally, we are wondering to what extent that market crash has ajtfected the purchasing power of the consumer. Well, there is no doubt but what some of those who played golf rather vigorously lasi summer will play less golf this year. It is more than likely that they will just have to buckle in and work a little harder than they have in the past. However, I am not one of those who believes that the country has gone to the dogs. I do firmly believe that we will have a pro - gressive year. I firmly believe that the livestock industry is a sound business and that livestock will do very well during 1930. But it is not wise to make too many predictions, because although it would be a year before you could check up on me, some men among you may have good memories} and might take me to task if we were to come here a year from todjay. However, the statements I have made, I be - lieve I am safe in making. The demand for your product will con - tinue good. There in no doubt about it and I believe at satisfactory prices. I know of little else to say. The noon hour has arrived or I might ramble on for i while longer, but I see that it is twelve o'clock and I thank you, Mr. Waggener, and ladles and gentlemen. </seg>

The sheep men not only support this organization, but they are, in addition, allowing them - selves an additional amount for advertising. This was used in the campaign by the National Live Stock and Meat Board and this past spring it was brought to the attention of the Nebraska Improved Live Stock Breeders Association here at one of our meetings. We put on a campaign through the State of Nebraska with the assistance of Mr. Pollock whereby we tried to explain as best we could in one week's time the work of the National Live Stock and Meat Board with the idea of putting across a program where we would support it with a larger amount. We met with the Nebraska Stockgrowers Associa - tion at Valentine at their annual meeting and solicited their support. We held meetings at Lexington, York,- and West Point and at all of these meetings I ] am sure much good was done. We held a meet - ing at Omaha where nine states were represented. We labored all day without Retting anywhere with the amount suggested to be de - ducted from the sale of each car of livestock. Finally it was left to a meeting during the Ak-Sar-Ben. We held this meeting at Omaha. The Omaha Livestock Exchange put on a banquet for us and we finally threshed this business out to where we suggested to the National Live Stock and Meat Board that 25 cents per car be deducted from each car of livestock. It [was decided that the amount to be deducted from truck loads should be in proportion. This was submitted to the National Live Stock and Meat Board and is being passed on to each and every livestock I organization in the United States. We hope that they will all support this movement with the idea that by April it can be put in force and the National Live Stock and Meat Board will have more to come back with. Radio has brought about a wonderful opportunity for the sub - stitute people to get into the homes. Every home in the United States that has a radio has it turned on at all hours of the day. Con - sequently, these advertising programs that the housewife hears are inroads on the livestock producers and sellers. It means that we must combat this, j That work cannot be done without additional funds. I believe at all times that the 25 cents per car is voluntary on the part of the 'shipper. I am sure that every man in this room will want to give the 25 cents per car, because I can assure you that </seg>
            <seg id="p631">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATION the work that is being done by the National Live Stock and Meat Board Is worthy of every shipper and grower in the United States. The work that is being done there is wonderful. j You will remember not very long ago that you went into a butcher shop to buy a beef roast and the butcher would throw in some liver. Now almost the opposite is true. At some places liver sells for 70 cents per pound. This Is due to the fact that experimental work has proved that liver is very valuable in the diet of anemic persons. The people are certainly bringing to the attention of the land the points that stand out for their particular meat. The lamb people have increased the consumption of lamb to such a wonderful extent that they are satisfied to pay that additional amount, feeling that they get so much good out of It. We are supporting an organization that is working for you and me each and every day of the year. In order to get the reaction here from those present, I am going to ask your sentiment with reference to the charge of 25 cents per car in - stead of 5 cents in order that we may pass it on to the National Live Stock and Meat Board. We are not in a position to tell you today just how much more the packer is going to give us to match this, but we are assured that he is going to increase his amount to one that will be worth while. The idea is to go out over the state and give meat-cutting demonstrations. You have probably all seen one of these. If you have not, you have missed a lot. Last year at a feeders meeting at the University we had a demonstration that I think was worth while. When I tell you that the packers are demanding much of these demonstrators' time and are paying all of their ex - penses to go to their packing plants and their centralized markets and tell them how to utilize the by-products of the carcasses in such ways as they can use them and get more money put of them, you will see the Importance of this. . Just recently Mr. Pollock received a telegram from a distant state asking him to send a man to demonstrate to their people how to cut meat and use it to best advantage. That is how j they appreciate good, work. With this additional per car charge, the thought is that more men could be put on to go out into these various states and demon - strate how to put meat up in most attractive form. That requires, of course, considerable more money, but apparently we must keep abreast of the times. We must combat the advertising of substitutes for our meat products if we are going to continue in the livestock business and get the most out of it. Right now there is being taught in the high schools throughout the United States a book which is being put out by the National Live Stock and Meat Board. This is being used by home economics de - partments. I know it is being used in a great many schools here in the State of Nebraska. I am going to ask you for an expression as to how you feel re - garding the work of the National Live Stock and Meat Board and </seg>
            <seg id="p632">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ■ I - whether you approve of the 25 cents per car charge. This will be collected by the commission men. Does any man feel that he does not get 25 cents worth of good from the National Live Stock and Meat Board? If we do not advertise our products. I do not know who will. The packer does a lot of advertising, but this is more for certain classes of product. We feel that we want to continue the edu - cational part of this work and continue to demonstrate to the people the advisability of using these cuts of meat that have not been utilized heretofore. We haye to raise the whole carcass and we want to sell as much of it as is possible. All those in favor of increasing the amount to 25 cents per car to be turned over to the National Live Stock and Meat Board for educational work, I am going to ask you to raise your handJ I might state in this connection that the western men wanted to raise it to as high as $3.00 per car: Some men were willing to make it $5.00 per car. Of course, they were the exception. The Colorado men stood out, insisting that a dollar a car be the amount. They felt that the work was so worthy of their consideration that a dollar a car was a very satisfactory amount. Mr. Waggener will pass our sentiment on to Mr. Pollock, telling him that we approve of the 25 cent deduction. The American Na - tional Live Stock Association meets In Denver this week and with their approval, I am sure the work will be carried on in the best form. I appreciate your expression here today and I am sure that each and every one of you men wlll.be glad to Increase this amount when you see the good that is being done by this meat board. In advertising any particular meat, there is a disadvantage to another. They are working at it in a broad way and from the producer's stand - point. Here is our plan. The advertisement that the meat man gets for nothing is the one that does him the most good. We are not going out to try to buy a whole page in the Saturday Evening Post or some of the other high-priced magazines, because today it is very simple to get articles from the National Live Stock and Meat Board. We feel that the commercial advertising should be left to the commercial packer or the commercial part of the advertising should be handled by the individual firm that is directly selling the article. We want to help in an educational way by making people want to come in and ask for what we have. We know that if we go to some butcher shops and try to put on a meat cutting demonstration the butcher will prob - ably say, "I've been cutting meat for twenty-five yearc, you can't tell me anything about it." What we want to do then Is to put on a meat cutting demonstration and show the butcher how he can use to ad - vantage scraps that he has been throwing away. We will get a lot further If we do this than we would by spending $15.00 to $20.00 for advertising In . the newspapers in that county. The' butcher will begin putting meat up In very attractive form. I think, gentlemen, </seg>
            <seg id="p633">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATION we are going to see the day in the very near future when this meat will come to the small butcher shops ready cut into steaks, roasts, etc., and ready sealed. Meat is going to be sold in these Frigidaire counters that you see in the chain stores and markets today. I see our lunches have arrived, so -we will adjourn until after we eat. NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVE STOCK BREEDERS ASSOCIATION ANNUAL MEETING Thursday Noon The meeting was called to order by Mr. Dan Hildebrand. MR. HILDEBRAND: I want to urge all of you to come back this spring for the Feeders Day Program. There is considerable Interest in the utilization of by-products raised on farms. Possibly those of you who read the Breeders Gazette noticed the bulletin from the Ohio Experiment Station. ' Those of you who did know about the ex - periment that was carried on at Ohio. This was conducted with yearling steers instead of calves. They were fed on corn stover and corn silage. The corn stover cattle were fed cottonseed cake and hay. On a per acre basis, the ensilage cattle returned some little more than the corn stover cattle. The packer who bought these cattle also gave a report on them and said all the lots were fat enough for any purpose. This merely backs what Dr. McCampbell told you yesterday. I am wondering if that isn't going to be worthwhile to you out here, especially when we know that a large percentage of this rough - age that now goes to waste could be used. in growing these calves in the winter and using grass in the summer time. I do believe that we have a lot of good material for study here { during the next few years and that is going to become beneficial. Carrying out the work of the Nebraska Improved Live Stock Breeders Association, I want to express to you my appreciation for the vote as president. This came very unexpected, as I did not think this honor was coming to me. I will do my best to serve you during the coming year. I assure you my whole heart is in the work. Mr. Waggener has a lot to do with the work of the Nebraska Improved Live Stock Breeders Association. They have done a lot this last year. You all know about the Hog Train that this organiza - tion sponsored and carried through. Mr. Waggener will give you a report on this past year's work. Mr. Waggenerl MR. WAGGENER: Gentlemen: I promise not to take over two or three minutes, because I am going to summarize the work very </seg>
            <seg id="p634">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE briefly. Possibly most of you attended the Hog Train- during the past year. We had very good attendances at each town where we stopped. Other activities might be listed as follows: Team Hitch Demonstrations — 82 using team hitches as result of the team demonstrations. Pig Crop Contest — you all heard about this yesterday morning. Feeders Meetings — 11 held last year. Attended by 3,400 different feeders. Meat Talks — National Live Stock and Meat Board. Winter Meetings. The activities of this organization are determined for the year by the Board of Directors at a meeting held the day before Feeders Day. This board is made up of the presidents of the various breed organizations. I thank you. If ! """""T"" ~~^~ ■ 1 Bis Team Hitches Save Time and Labor MR. HILDEBRAND: I want to say in behalf of the people in the good state of Nebraska that the support of the National Live Stock and Meat Board during this last year was wonderful. They gave us some publicity that helped a lot. There is a man here in the audience who has helped us a lot. He not only gave us his help and assist - ance with the Hog Train, but also a lot of publicity. I want to intro - duce to you Mr. Howard Biggar of the Journal Stockman. He went with us for a whole week and gave us the publicity on those meetings. (Mr. ChasrGraff, who is listed on the program to give the Pres - ident's Address, was unable to attend the meetings in person). Gentlemen, we are ' extremely fortunate in having a gentleman from our neighboring state to the east with us today. We are always glad to have Iowa here and we like to go over there. We have here today Mr. E. M. Harmon of Successful Farming. Mr. Harmon will talk on "Too Much Loose Talk," </seg>
            <seg id="p635">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATION TOO MUCH LOOSE TALK E. M. HARMON Gentlemen, after an introduction like that and some of the com - ments that I have heard today, I feel almost like a small boy in an incident that happened down in the county where I was raised, and I might as well admit that I was raised in the Ozarks of southern Missouri. It was in the days of the first automobiles. There was a fellow driving down along one of those country roads. Ahead of him he saw a small boy riding a calf. The youngster reached a bridge and could not get the calf across. The fellow drove up behind him and seeing his difficulty he said. "Say, kid, you just lead that calf around front and I'll drive behind and honk my horn and he will go across." Well, he did this, but the calf jumped into the creek instead of going across the bridge. I do want to assure you that I am glad to have the opportunity to visit Nebraska again. That hasn't been my privilege so very many times, but I am always glad to be here and I am thoroughly enjoying myself. You are to be congratulated upon the splendid program you have put across up to date. This subject that was assigned to me deals with a matter that is coming to be of considerable importance to tihe livestock industry. I do not know that I should say is coming to be — it has for a good many years been of considerable importance, but we are awakening more and more to the realization of its importance. During the past few months the country has been flooded with statements regarding a so-called new disease known as undulant fever. Some of these statements have been true, others have been half true, and still others have been absolutely untrue. Disease Known for Centuries In the first place this is not a new disease.' No one knows how old it is. Your own Dr. Van Es states that there is every reason to believe that Hippocrates describes this disease] in about the year 400 B. C. Bruce discovered the organism which causes it in about 1887. In 1897 Wright perfected a method of diagnosis by the agglutination test. Within the next ten years it was definitely proven that the organism causing Malta fever was carried through goats milk. It was not until 1918 that Alice Evans called attention to the close resemblance of this organism in goats milk [to that which causes abortion In cattle. The point that we wish to emphasize here, how - ever, is that this Is not a new disease. It has probably been going on for decades in this country. It is doubtful if it Is any more prevalent now than it has been In the past. Neither is most, of the true infor - mation which has had so much publicity new in any way. Scientists </seg>
            <seg id="p636">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE who have been 'studying this problem have realized that they do not know enough about it to give it publicity. However, in the hands of the alarmists this information has been given a tinge of sensationalism mid combined with half truths which has attracted much attention. Present Number of Cases Overestimated Another ridiculous statement would lead us to believe that there are 50,000 cases in the United States. In this connection your own Dr. Van Es states "It may suit the purpose of a propogandist or an alarmist to speak of 50,000 cases of undulant fever but if their state - ments merely pertain to 50,000 people with' positive agglutination tests they are gross exaggerations. A case of undulant fever should never be accepted as such unless clinical manifestations combined with serologic evidence warrant such a diagnosis or unless the Br. abortus organism can be isolated from the patient." i As a matter of actual fact, until June 1 of last year 1,296 cases have been reported in the United States over a period of seven years and five months. This is exclusive of Texas, Arizona, and New Mex - ico. Doubtless there have been many unreported cases. Doubtless there are unreported cases today but when we have to go back over a period of seven years to find 1,296 cases and realize that most of these are cured by this time, it is hard to see how one who values his reputation would hazard a guess of 50,000 cases in the United States today. Disease Spread by Several Methods Another unjust insinuation is found In the fact that some of the propoganda leaves one with the impression that the disease comes entirely from drinking the milk of infected cows. We know that it is possible to contract undulant fever by drinking raw milk from in - fected goats. We have equal reason to believe that it is also possible to contract the disease by drinking raw milk from infected cows. The important point, however, is that there seems to be every reason to think that there are other modes of transmission of just as great or greater Importance. In this connection. Dr. C. P. Fitch of the University of Minnesota, and one of the leading authorities on contagious abortion, states that many of the cases of undulant fever about which he knows are in men working in packing houses and with infected herds. Dr. Hardy goes further to state that men are no more susceptible to the disease than women. Yet among the farm population nine times as many cases have been found in men as in women. This, he thinks, shows that a great deal of - Infection is taken . in through the skin by people who are associated with herds which are. infected. Few Children Have the Disease Another fact which Dr. .Hardy brings out is that there are only four cases per 100,000 population exclusive of packing-house em- </seg>
            <seg id="p637">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATION ployees in cities of over 5,000, while among packing-house employees there are 287 cases per 100,000 people. Also while children are the heavy milk drinkers yet there have been very few cases of undulant fever in this group. Most of it is found in people between 20 and 45 years old, which would indicate that it is primarily an occupational disease. These factors show the ridiculousness of the intimation that undulant fever comes solely from milk. In spite of these facts, however, we have seen information broad - casted which would leave one with the impression that milk is the one means of the transmission of this disease. Not long ago I saw a statement credited to the American Child Welfare Association as fol - lows: "Since the source of this disease is to be found in milk of in - fected cows, it is apparent that it can be controlled by the pasteuriza - tion of milk." There is one very definite mis-statement here in that pasteurization of milk will not control the disease. It would elim - inate a part of the troubles. The other implied mis-statement rests in the fact that in a great many cases raw milk is not the source of undulant fever. Our medical authorities, the press, and every one interested in human health should carefully guard the statements that they make in this connection as they are likely to create wrong impressions and do more harm than good. On the other hand other individuals have gone to almost the opposite extreme. One prominent farm paper has gone so far as to state that no one has ever been able to prove that milk transmitted this disease and to imply that it probably is not transmitted in this way. That, of course, is entirely wrong. There is every reason to believe that probably 40 per cent of the cases of this disease in this country are traceable to raw milk. All Infected Livestock Can Transmit It to Man The important thing for us to consider, however, is that all live - stock infected with the abortion organism is likely to transmit it to man. We know that the organism is most prevalent in cattle, hogs and goats. We know too that poultry, sheep and horses may be car - riers of the organism and that man may acquire it through contact with these animals. We know also that there are three distinct strains of the organism, commonly known as the goat, swine and the bovine types. All evidence available seems to indicate that the goat type is by far the most virulent in its relation to man while the bovine or cow type' is the least virulent. Even here, however, we find the scientists who know the most about the disease are the ones who want to say the least. They all emphasize the fact that we do not know enough about it to make too many positive statements. Of one thing, however, we can be sure. This disease is bringing to the livestock Industry one of its. greatest sources of loss. Herds which would otherwise be profitable are unprofitable. We know too that it is a disease that is comparatively easy to control. We know 21 </seg>

This has been distributed to the veterinarians of the state and we have some of these bulletins avail - able now. I have been very much impressed by Mr. Harmon's talk before you. I heard him discuss this at Chicago. We are trying to put into your minds something that will make a fair analysis of this disease. We are merely dealing as the subject indicated. I should like to have the time at some time or other to discuss the question of abortion with you, but for the present I want you to have one of these bulletins if you want it.

This Howard Gramlich, head of the Animal Husbandry Department of your College of Agri - culture, Livestock Feeding Authority and Livestock Judge at large, has been considerate enough of me to extend to me, for three years in succession, an invitation to attend this annual Feeders' Day meet - ing of yours. Prior engagements prevented my acceptance of the In - vitation for two years. This year, I am here — and glad to be here. Texas, for years, sent cattle up the trail to Nebraska. When the railways came and closed the trail days, Texas began shipping cattle to Nebraska. We are still shipping thousands of cattle to Ne - braska for finishing. Naturally, we, In Texas, believe Nebraska is a great state. Then, too. Professor Gramlich has been coming to the Southwestern Exposition and Fat Stock Show, at Fort Worth, Texas, and the State Fair of Texas, at Dallas, and judging our feeder cattle and breeding cattle. | His work in Texas has caused us to believe that he is a real cattle judge. F Many Cattle in Texas ' Professor Gramlich has not only judged cattle but he has talked to us at our meetings about the cattle business and, mind you, the cattle business means a lot to us folks in Texas. We have, on our farms and ranches, nearly six million bead of cattle. In two-year-old </seg>
            <seg id="p643">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' i ASSOCIATION and older cows, we have more than three million 1 head. So, you see we are very much concerned about the cattle business and Professor Gramlich has talked in such a way that we feel he knows his cattle. But he is not the only Nebraska man that is! known to us. This man, Loeffel, chief of your swine investigational work, knows his pigs and has convinced us that he knows how to feed them. Professor Loeffel is doing a great work in your Swine Division. Then, over in your Horse Division, you have Derrick. We know he knows his horses. This man is a Texas boy, a graduate from our Texas A. &amp; M. College. But Derrick is not all you have taken from the Texas A, &amp; M. You came down there and took our Bible and, today, Nebraska University has, as football coach, the Bible that was for years the guiding spirit of the Texas A. &amp; M. football team and the beacon light of athletics In the Southwest. With him, came our best wishes for him and for the University of Nebraska. Success to you in! all contests except when you play Texas A. &amp; M. The Good Book says if you have faith you can move mountains. Well you have taken our Bible and our Derrick, bo we, in Texas, are looking for something to move. Looking at your past, looking at your present, you have moved — yes, you have moved, obstacles as large as mountains. Progress in Nebraska Has Been Great The progress and development of Nebraska as a great agricul - tural and livestock state is a fascinating story; from the early days of the cow camps in the Sand Hills, when cattle were driven from grass to water and from water to grass, to the present-day Nebraska, with nine highly developed and distinct types of farming. Tou still have your cattle-ranching area in the Sand Hills; i but you have added the irrigated wheat section in the Southwest, the sugar beet section in the Platte Valley, the small grain and grazing area in the North - west, the central corn and livestock area, the southern cash grain and livestock area, the general farming area in the Southeast, and the intensive meat producing area in the Northeast; How has such progress and development been made possible? To begin with, a state with great natural resources plus a people with love and ambition to do and to conquer, a people blessed with a vision and a spirit of courage, have made possible this development. In your early days you established this University which has grown into a great institution which may be likened unto a great power house generating and maintaining the motive power that is driving Nebraska on to greater and greater accomplishments. And, I say to you now that this great University with its many colleges is your guaranty of future development and prosperity. ' Gash and Corn The mention of the word prosperity brings i me to the first "C" of my talk. You will remember that I am to ialk on the 4 "C's." </seg>
            <seg id="p644">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE This first "C" is CASH — that which we all must have whether we eat apple sauce, bacon, or corn bread; drink apple cider, beer, or cham - paign; whether we ride in automobiles, buggies, or carriages. We must have CASH. This urge for cash with which to buy the neces - sities and the comforts of life caused the early farmers of Nebraska to turn to CORN as a source of CASH. "So the "C" of second import - ance is CORN. The production of corn has meant much to Nebraska. Corn has brought you cash. In 1866, your corn production was two million bushels; today, your five-year average is 214 million bushels. Corn is Nebraska's leading grain crop as is shown by its name, "The Cornhusker Commonwealth." Hpw has this great increase in pro - duction been made possible? By increased acres? Partly, but also by the work of this College of Agriculture in increasing the acre yield through soil improvement and the use of better seed. Cattle In the early days a large percentage of your corn crop was sold as a "cash" crop; but, today, only about 25 per cent of the Ne - braska corn crop is sold in the raw state. The remaining 75 per cent is used for fattening and maintaining livestock. This introduces my third "C" in the series — CATTLE. I think we have the liberty to go hack to the old Roman meaning of the term "cattle" which included not only what we term "cattle" but all livestock such as sheep and hogs. The combining of the corn of Nebraska and the cattle of Ne - braska, not only reduced the tonnage on a raw material but added considerably to the sale value of the corn and the sale value of the cattle. The additional finish made possible a higher price on the grass and the hay that went into the making of the carcass of the unfinished steer. But more than that, the feeding of corn to the cattle made possible the retaining on the farms of Nebraska, the fer - tility to be needed by future corn and other grain crops. The practice proved good and corn yields continued to increase and more cattle were needed to market the great corn crops. So you came to Texas for more feeder cattle and calves. Your demand for good feeders — the kind capable of giving you the high dollar for your corn — caused our southwestern breeders to begin the use of better beef-type bulls. The day of the Longhorn with his endurance and speed enabling him to make the long trails began to pass; and today, Texas is shipping into Nebraska and the other Corn Belt States, a million head of choice beef-type calves and steers each year. The industrial and commercial growth and development in the United States called for beef. The demand for good cattle increased; the price of lands increased; the value of corn increased; the fullest utilization of your immense corn crop and other grains, your grasses and your hays could mean - millions of dollars to Nebraska farmers. Your Agricultural College, ever on the job, studying the situation, </seg>
            <seg id="p645">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATION analyzing the trend of the times, uncovering the demands for better finished and lighter cattle, saw the need for a rich protein feed to balance your corn and other grains in order to insure the hapid growth and finish of younger .animals. Feeding trials wei^e planned and car - ried on and Nebraska again looked to the South and Southwest and this time COTTONSEED CAKE was added as the fourth "C." Cottonseed Cake This fourth "C" — COTTONSEED CAKE is a high powered con - centrated protein — both feed and tonic — making more efficient every bushel of grain, every acre of grass, every ton of hay, even your alfalfa, and thereby increasing the productiveness if each acre of this rich soil of yours. This cottonseed cake and meal, which has been tried by your College of Agriculture and your experienced feeders and found to mean so much in the feed lot for hogs, beef cattle, and sheep, is also valuable to the dairy farmers of this state which now ranks fourth in dairying. This same cottonseed cake extends its usefulness beyond the dairy barns and the feed lots and is found out yonder on your Sand Hills supplementing the grass and insuring a high percentage calf crop and strong, vigorous cows capable of giving the calf the milk that it needs to get the right start. . ■ The usefulness of this cottonseed cake and meal is not spent when it is fed to your cattle; for, after doing its bit in adding to the growth and finish of the steer, it has a manural value of twenty-four to thirty dollars per ton fed. Cottonseed cake is especially rich in nitrogen, each ton containing approximately 140 pounds in addition to the 88 pounds of phosphoric acid and potash.' Therefore, this fourth "C" has also contributed to the improvement of your soil and has made possible more CORN, more CATTLE, more CASH — more power to Ne - braska and her people who have the wisdom to use the 4 "C's." CREEP FEEDING CALVES — DOES IT PAY? J. J. MOXLEY, Live Stock Specialist, K. S. A. C. The creep feeding of various kinds of stock has been practiced for many years. But, It has been only of late years, since the de - mands for small cuts of meat, that the creep feeding of calves has interested cattle producers of this section. For the benefit of those who are not acquainted with the term of creep feeding, I will say it Is a method of handling calves, so they are. permitted access to grain while nursing their mothers; to assist nature In getting more weight and finish at an early age. It is a method which permits the quickest possible turnover in producing finished beef. </seg>
            <seg id="p646">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Two Reasons for Creep Feeding Aa we see it in Kansas there, are two reasons for creep feeding calves; one because a pound of finished beef can be produced more cheaply that way; and again because the consumer wants these small cuts of well finished beef. If both producer and consumer are re - warded by such a method, then it has double advantages. What in - formation I have to offer has been gathered quite largely from several hundred of the best cowmen in our state, who have gone to con - siderable trouble to furnish- us accurate information. This year we hope to get information on about 7,000 head of creep fed calves. %'- f M&amp;^-£rPywJuA 'Mfc&gt;' y ' '.-■r".T* -." i Mr. D. W. HarUell. Meat Cutting Specialist from the National Live Stock and Meat Board. ChicaKO, Who Gave a Meat Cutting Demonstration the Evening Before Feeders' Day and Also at the Ladles' Program on Feeders' Day. Must Use Good Breeding Stock There are several other phases of management to be considered if you are to get the most out of creep feeding. Like ail other ways of producing beef cheaply, you must have the good beefy type of </seg>
            <seg id="p647">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATION foundation stock, because of all the different ways of seeking profit in handling beef cattle no one way returns as much 1 as using the good bulls and cows. There is no substitute for good breeding and I would suggest that the most important move a cowman' can make who con - templates feeding his calves, is to look to the kind of bull he is j using and to the selection of his cows. Early Calves Most Profitable With that as a foundation, another Important phase in producing these creep fed calves is to have them come just as early in the spring as you can take care of them. Just how important is that? Our experience in Kansas has shown that the average cow calving in May will wean about a 350 pound calf, because she has only been able to suckle it about two months on good grass; the grass then browns, the flies get bad, and the calf suffers for want of milk. When this late calf was young, the cow was fresh, and on grass, and gave more milk than the calf could handle and then when the calf was old enough to take it, the cow didn't have enough milk. Contrast with that: the cow which calves in the forepart of March or even earlier. She gives a good flow of milk for two months on dry feed because she la fresh and then when she goes on grass, she renews her milk supply and as a result, the early calf has twice as many months with plenty of milk as the late one and he is weaned, without feeding, weighing around 500 pounds. If, however, the calf comes too early, the cow is suckled down in poor condition before grass starts and the calf gets stunted unless, of course, the cow is fed a heavy feed which is usually prohibitive in producing beef calves cheaply. Our results in Kansas this past year showed that the calves which came in April made about $4.50 more profit than those which came in May; likewise', March calves made about $4.50 more profit than April born calves and to a lesser extent January and February calves were more profitable than March calves. This would apply to the calves which were not creep fed, also. If you did creep feed, then these early calves have a decided advantage in that they can be taught to eat before they are turned out on pasture. I wish to say here that calves born at any time of the year may be creep fed, but from the standpoint of getting the •'{ cows to turn off the most beef for her year's keep, we find in your I state that the cow calving in early spring does the best job. And yet, very desirable results can be obtained with some fall calves which were creep fed while the cows were on dry feed. Advantage of Creep Feeding First: To get to this question of creep feeding: What are its advantages? It adds weight. For each bushel ot corn fed you may expect ten or more pounds of additional beef. A [February or March I calf which has access to grain will ordinarily eat about ten bushels </seg>
            <seg id="p648">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE of grain and weigh 100 pounds more than a similar calf not creep fed. An April calf will ordinarily eat about seven bushels of grain by weaning time and a May calf about three bushels by weaning time; From these figures you may see that the increased weight will pay for the cost of the grain. Second: Creep feeding adds .finish. This past year the creep fed calves were appraised at weaning time at $1.00 to $2.00 per cwt., over those not creep fed. Third: Creep feeding saves shrink at weaning time as the calves go directly on feed without a set-back. This is perhaps the cheapest beef the cowman makes — just what he saves at this time. Fourth: It permits marketing the calves 45 to 90 days earlier depending upon how much grain was gotten into' them before wean - ing. Our early spring calves which ate as much as ten bushels of grain before weaning were finished last fall on a 45 to 100 day dry lot feed. Some were sold oft the cows in killing condition but ordinarily we consider it advisable to put more finish on them and more weight also. . Fifth: It evens up the calf crop; as the calves with poor suckling mothers eat more, and thus hold their own with the better sucking cows' calves. Sixth: It permits the cows to go into the winter in better con - dition as the calves do not pull the cows' down so much in flesh. Creep feeding is of course meant primarily for the man who pro - duces and Immediately fattens out' his own calves, and for this reason the man who winters over his calves as stockers would not care for the extra finish. . •• Cows Must Bring Calves to Feeders Now, as to who can creep feed? That is a very important ques - tion. You may creep feed if you have a central watering place, where the cows will loaf around during a part of every day, so the calves will have access to a conveniently placed feeder. If, however, the cows can water any place over a big pasture, it is difficult to get the cows to bring their calves in close to a feeder. One of our cooperators has overcome this objection by placing three feeders at three different watering places in a section and is meeting with good success. Another uses shade at his feeders to attract the calves and salt to attract the cows. It is not so much the size of the pasture as it is the possibility . of getting the cows to come to a central place daily. While .our smaller cow men have the best results, still we have one in Southwest Kansas with a pasture of 2,000 acres watered by one spring, who is con - vinced that he can make money by feeding his calves. There is one thing certain, if you put the grain out there for them and they do not eat, it doesn't cost anything, and if they do, they return pounds </seg>
            <seg id="p649">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATION of beef for It. Quite often a man will want to place the feeder con - venient to himself instead of convenient to the calves. He should not do this. ' In making a creep feeder, our Kansas men use a small self-feeder with wide protecting eaves to prevent the grain from get - ting wet. They build a fence of boards, poles or woven wire around it with narrow openings about sixteen Inches wide at various places for the calves to slip in. These openings are usually made by driving down posts about sixteen inches apart and tying them together across the top to keep the cows out. - Shelled Corn Superior As Feed As to what to feed: Shelled corn has proven the best from the standpoint of grains, getting the calves to take it and standing the weather. Ground barley, kafir, mllo and other similar grains have also given good results. Oats is a good growing feed but does not put on as much finish. When the cow gets pretty well along in her milking period and does not furnish much milk, it is perhaps advisable to mix a little cottonseed or linseed in the grain. ■ ■ ■..-■■ Creep Fed Calves Are Profitable In our Kansas Beef Production Contest this last year, It was shown that a good early calf, creep fed, may be weaned weighing 600 pounds. The Beef Production Champion weaned calves weighing over 600 pounds at seven and one-half months old and when fed in the dry lot for thirty days bringing them up to 668 pounds set a new high top on the Kansas City market for calves for 1929 at $16.25 a cwt. After deducting the cost of the calf's feed he got al - most $90.00 for keeping a cow a year. This man did an exceptionally good job of handling his calves, but several others were not far be - hind. - For the man who produces his own calves and his feed, we know of no more conservative permanent, profitable, method of producing beef, than by using good type breeding stock, wintering the cows well, producing early calves, creep feeding them, and marketing them, be - fore they have a birthday. </seg>

This he did very capably and to the entire satisfaction of all those present. The minutes of the last meeting were read and there being no additions or .corrections, were approved. Under the order of old business, the chair requested Mr. Fouts to report on. the activities of the banquet committee and explain why no banquet was held during 1929. Mr. Fouts reported that because the program at the State Fair was so full of separate breed meetings, no time was available for such a banquet. He stated that it was the expressed opinion of his committee ' that such a banquet should be held during the 1930 State Fair, the dates for the same to be ad - vertised in advance, and that herdsmen from the various show herds be invited to attend. After some discussion, it was suggested by Mr. MacQueen that a downtown meeting might be best while Mr. Graff stated that he was not in favor of the banquet being, put on especially for herdsmen. It was moved by Mr. Straub and seconded by Mr. Morrill that the committee be continued with its present membership and that it be empowered to organize and conduct a banquet during the week of the State Fair in the manner which seemed most advisable. The motion carried. As chairman of the National Live Stock and Meat Board Com - mittee, Mr. Hlldebrand reported its activities. He brought out the fact that numerous successful meetings had been held with the object of promoting the work of the meat board and that following an in - teresting meeting at Omaha, plans had been devised for the organi - zation of an Interstate Live Stock Feeders and Growers Association to act as a permanent organization to further the work as -well as the income of the board. He also told of the excellent work of the Omaha Journal Stockman in supporting the campaign favoring the work of the National Live Stock and Meat Board and of the work of Mr. Randall of the Omaha Stock Yards in boosting the cause of meat at the various county fairs and live stock meetings. Upon motion by Mr. Hlldebrand and seconded by Mr. Claason, the report of the com - mittee was accepted as read. Mr. Gramlich moved and Mr. Straub seconded that a vote of thanks be extended to the Omaha Journal Stockman and to Mr. Al Randall for their excellent cooperation in furthering the cause of the National Live Stock and Meat Board.

The passage of a resolution condemning the shipping in of mongrel dairy cattle. </seg>
            <seg id="p654">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 3. The disposal of mongrel dairy calves as vealers rather than as mature steers. 4. A drive for increased membership (perhaps at a banquet the day prior to Feeders Day). 5. The appointment of a legislative committee to promote the interests of the live stock people in the condemnation and prevention of abortion as well as in the promotion of a law requiring state-wide tuberculin testing in cattle. 6. That the association should go on record as favoring less wheat and more legumes for eastern Nebraska, with the result that the increased fertility and increased live stock would eventually increase production as a whole. 7. That if possible the dates of the Denver Live Stock Show should be changed so they would not conflict with the meet - ing of the State Association of County Pair Secretaries. 8. Perhaps a study of the problem as to whether the Board of Agriculture and the State Department of Agriculture, for c economy's sake, be combined. 9. That the association should do more work and less talking. Mr. McLaughlln's suggestions were well received and the Chair - man stated that a committee to consider them would be appointed In the near future. Mr. Graff, following up Mr. McLaughlin's suggestions, maintained that an interesting directory which was made out on a basis of the reputation of the breeders and the health of their live stock would be of particular value. He also believed that the directory should be made educational. Mr. Wldle moved and Mr. Claasen seconded that it be the concensus of opinion of the meeting that it favored the com - pilation of a new directory and that a committee be appointed to take the matter in charge. Motion unanimously carried. This was fol - lowed by considerable discussion by the members present as to exactly what should be included In the directory and as to how it should be compiled. It was finally decided to leave these matters to the com - mittee. It was moved by Mr. Gramllch and seconded by Mr. Wldle that the chair appoint a committee of three to confer on the program to bo arranged for winter meetings. Motion carried. At this time the chair called, on Mr. A. B. Graham, chairman of the Stock Growers Association of Western Nebraska, and bis secretory. Mr. Broome He later called on Mr. Modisett. These men gave the views of the western stockgrowers on the work of the NebraBka Improved Live Stock Breeders Association. At that time Mr. Prey of the Denver Yards and Mr. Rogers of Omaha came into the meeting and were called on to express their views on the work of the association which they did. much to the satisfaction of those present. </seg>

Manager Nebraska Certified Potato Growers When I received notice that I was to be the first man on the pro - gram at our annual convention, I could not help but wonder if grow - ers would not be more interested in a discussion pertaining to the immediate seed crop rather than one pertaining to the future. Per - haps we can stay within our title: and discuss to some extent the im - mediate future of the seed deal, as well as prospects for later years. There has been quite a change in our business during the past five years. There are a good many growers here today that have been producing Certified Nebraska Triumphs for the past five years or even longer. There are very few among these who have not known the disappoint - ment of rejection. Do you remember those seasons when we waged an almost con - stant warfare against Mosaic or Spindle Tuber, or both? They were very discour - aging and it looked as though we were never going to successfully control them, and that we must continually rogue our fields hoping only! to keep the percentage low enough to allow certification. wm. morrow - lt was not at all uncommon to reject around fifty per cent of the fields. We could consider that we had at least three serious hazards. Mosaic, Spindle Tuber, and Fusarium Wilt. Thanks to the aggressiveness of Professor Werner and. Dr. Goss we have practically controlled spindle tuber and mosaic. There Is no longer any reason for rejection from these two diseases. We are doing better with Fusarium Wilt as is evidenced by our certification standard today, where only two per cent wilt is permitted in the field and four per cent stem-rot in the bin, although we must still consider them as seriouß factors in the Northern tier of counties.

We believe this seed to be prac - tically free of virus disease, and such seed properly cared for will continue practically free of these diseases, although we must admit its susceptibility to stem rot, black leg, and scab. These indexed seed stocks are not to be considered a guarantee of certification by any means, nor are they to be considered perfect. They are the very best .stock available and, as such, are to be recommended to you as an important factor in increasing your quality, and in decreasing your hazard and your production costs. The grower who keeps himself supplied with the very best stock available, growing it in a properly cared for seed plat, should eliminate the necessity of rogueing his commercial field entirely except for Fusarium or a possible infection of black-leg. We hope that in another year or two Dr. Goss will re - port an effective control measure for Fusarium Wilt and Scab. Has not our progress in Certified seed production been about as rapid as that of the automobile and the radio? We hope that in the production of our next crop we can find every grower taking advantage of the seed plat method of eliminat - ing rogueing and that those growers whose seed stock is at all ques - tionable will equip themselves with new seed of recommended quality.

Tom Jones, a wholesale grocery at New Orleans, wants a car of seed po - tatoes to distribute among his customers and he starts to shop We write him a letter— tell him that we have been in the seed potato business a long time, that our seed potatoes are Certified in strict accordance with standards prescribed by the Nebraska College of Ag - riculture, that our inspectors are approved by the College, that our growers ate careful and experienced and that the reputation of Ne - hraska Certified seed can not be questioned. We refer him to other customers In his vicinity, to various tests conducted, and then quote him a price, assuring him that in spite of the premium that must be asked, he is securing greater seed value per dollar invested than he can hope to secure elsewhere. He also gets a letter from some com - peting state, in which he learns that they also are producing very high class Certified potatoes, that their soil Is new.j that their altitude is high and In former seasons the price quoted has been lower than that quoted by Nebraska, although we believe our quotations on Certified seed this year are more nearly those of other states than ever before </seg>
            <seg id="p664">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE He gets a third letter from some company that assures him that it is their desire to supply him with the best seed stock available. The letter tells him that this shipper cannot afford to trust his grading to the average farmer, but that the stock Is all ware-house graded under their personal supervision in order that the purchaser will be absolutely sure of getting good seed. If Mr. Jones happens to be well enough informed to realize the value of careful field inspections, he may even be advised by the company selling the branded stock that the seed they are being offered could have been certified but was not for some reason or that it was rejected because of a trace of disease that did not bother In the south and the quotation offered by this shipper of Branded stock will very often be 75c to $1.00 per cwt. lower than Certified. When our competiting states offer a lower quotation than we do on Genuine. Certified Seed they are not to be criticized for doing so. That is their business. When the shipper of Branded stock praises his product to the limit and then quotes an attractive price to his prospect in comparison to Certified, he is rather to be complimented on his business judgment and we to be criticized for permitting the margin on which to operate. There is probably a market in the' south for 1,000 cars of quality toed Triumphs. Certainly we are better equipped to supply this market than any other state. Let's produce the best as efficiently as possible, secure the business, and hold it. CERTIFIED SEED POTATOES AS VIEWED BY THE SOUTHERN GROWER By JAMES W. WESTON Vice President, Gulf States Seed Co., Alexandria, Louisiana I Southern Potato Growers are interested in Certified Seed Pota - toes because of their increased yielding ability, their vigor, their power to withstand hardships, their freedom from disease, and their uniform maturity, in other words for their vim, vigor and vitality. The startling changes in seed improvement that have been made in the last few years has given rise to the term. Known Origin Seed, as associated with Certified Seed. , The Early Potato producing states in the Central Southern sec - tion are particularly concerned with the Bliss Triumph Variety. Irish Cobblers taking second place in commercial value. The colleges of Agriculture in the Southern States thru their Experiment Stations and Extension Departments, have tested Certified Seed, and the summary shows, that in one year, in thirty-one tests, in Louisiana, the gain was forty-one bushels per acre, with an acreage increase for all tests of Certified over Uncertified of 46.4 bushels per. acre. The states producing Certified Bliss Triumphs that the South - ern Potato Growers are particularly interested in, are Nebraska, North </seg>

Black Wart and Powder Scab have not been reported as oc - curring in the Great Plains area and both diseases are under quar - antine by the- United States Department of Agriculture, and could not be shipped if present. Even table stock can be certified in this manner and it all tends to confuse the Grower who is really interested in known Origin Certified Seed. Southern Growers are beginning to understand that the real reason for difference in Known Origin se - lected certified State inspected seed over that; of the old fashioned just any potato, is that, in addition to the effects' of climatic and soil conditions,- the Certified Seed Growers themselves, are certified, and can exert a very real Influence on the uniformity of the product se - lected. ■ . . '' </seg>
            <seg id="p666">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE It is understood that tuber unit or hill selection is the best means of potato Improvement. It makes it possible for the grower to make a very uniform product of the best. The elimination of disease by this process undoubtedly explains the success of many selections. It is by increasing the superior strains thus selected and using them in general culture that larger yields, ■ better quality and market preference has been obtained. The Southern Potato Grower realizes the need for more uni - formity and quality and yielding ability. There is a demand for better seed due to the increased cost of production and the con - sumers demand for a better quality product. The increased use of seed that is capable of producing a maxi - mum number of healthy hills properly spaced for the production of uniform sized tubers, will make possible a better grade and a more uniform sized product to meet market requirements, that consumers demand. Many Southern Growers are Impressed with the seed they buy, by the appearance of the seed on arrival. If the seed is ex - cellent in appearance and produces a good crop they are satisfied. If the seed is poor in appearance and produces a good crop, they will think that on account of their superior ability and good land, that they grew a good crop in spite of the poor looking seed. Ap - pearance in seed potatoes does not necessarily mean that there is a loss in vitality, but it helps to keep satisfied customers. Often times the best of seed from Western Nebraska that will produce a maximum crop may be irregular in size and shape and immature and under - size for table stock, and still be worth more for planting purposes than another lot of seed having a fine appearance. In regard to oversized seed, seed weighing more than an aver - age of eight ounces, even tho of the best selection, is, that large potatoes do not cut and plant as efficiently as potatoes of smaller size. Potatoes that will run over twelve ounces do not usually have any more eyes than a potato of six to eight ounces, and when cutting Cor seed, it takes more seed by weight to plant the same ground with large potatoes than it does with the more medium size. South - ern Growers often plant on wide rows. The best growers cut their tubers lengthwise into chunky pieces weighing about one ounce, planted fresh cut, twelve to fifteen inches apart and fertilize with a high grade complete fertilizer at least one hundred pounds for each bushel of seed planted. The use of potatoes as seed large enough to increase the average size of the cut seed piece one-fourth to one - half ounce, each, Increases the growers cost of seed per acre from five to ten dollars, and in one instance reported, the increase amount - ed to nearly 100 per cent of seed required to plant the given acreage. The Southern Seed Grower is further Interested in Certified Seed sources that will give the best appearing stock when produced. Appearance is a hard item to define. It is one of the most Important factors in the movement of potatoes on the market. Appearance, </seg>
            <seg id="p667">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION the jobbers and brokers of table stock say "Makes 90 per cent of the sale." This varies with the price and demand. When the market is draggy and slow, the bright clean, uniform ipotatoes are the flr B t to move. This would mean, then, that the potatoes that are uni - formly matured, uniform type, free from defects \ and blemishes, would sell the best. Good seed is not wholly responsible for good appear - ing stock, nor is it responsible for efficient potato production. Good soil, abundance of plant food and excellent cultural care, used in connection with good seed, furnish the combination for large crops of good quality. Even in years of low prices, | large yields will re - duce the cost of production per bushel, and will return a fair profit per acre. While a small yield per acre means an increased cost per bushel and will usually result in a possible loss of money. Disease and factors effecting appearance; late maturing or "Giant Hill" potatoes are often found in fields: and are what cause the immature potatoes that will skin badly when dug and by the time they get to the consuming market at the other end of the line, they are withered and poor in appearance and it hurts the sale of the good potatoes. Scab and Rhizoctonia are effectively controlled by the hot for - maldehide treatment, but only a proportion of the seed stock planted are thus treated at present. Scab was the cause of 20 per cent of the rejections by the Federal Government inspectors in 1929 and it is considered one of the most feared of the present troubles. Rhiz - octonia is the cause of many poor stands in cold wet Springs. Spindle tuber decreases yields about 70 per cent and effects appearance of the stock by the off shape tubers, thlB is equally true of unmottled curly dwarf. Mosaic effects yield to a greater degree than any other potato disease, giving only about 20 per cent of yield compared to other potato stock which is in a healthy condition. The severity is dependent on weather conditions being affected by the frequent per - iods of high temperature following periods of cool moist weather. But this disease affects yield principally, the tubers produced being of good shape but running generally, very high to No. 2 stock. The requirements the Southern Potato Growers demand of the Northern Potato Growers of Certified Seed Potatoes, is, to see that the seed potatoes they produce yield them a maximum return. Many Southern Potato Growers appreciate that at no! time in the history of the crop can greater results be secured at less labor and expense than with an investment in the best seed. Service is the greatest asset that the Certified Seed Grower pos - sesses in the South. The Southern Growers are rapidly being con - vinced that the buying of the best State Inspected Certified Seed Po - tatoes is the most remunerative investment they! can make. </seg>

ROBINSON, Hastings, Florida Mr. Werner haa aske.i me to discuss with you "Marketing Flor - ida Potatoes Cooperatively." This is not a difficult assignment, but to some of us a rather dry one. There is nothing new or mysterious about Cooperative Marketing: To us it is simply applying the ABC's of. business procedure to the distribution and selling of the Florida Spuds.

The field of true Cooperative .Organ - ization is a broad one and offers wonder - ful opportunities. In the most forward - ' looking minds in the field of Agricultural activity it is the source from which real . farm relief must eventually come. Prbduction is the only branch of Ag - riculture that seems to have come some- where n,ear keeping pace with other busl- H. l. robinson ness and industrial activities. Farmers have been more open-minded in accepting improved cultural methods and. machinery that have caused their pro - duction to advance far ahead of their marketing and distribution and Judging by the facts so admirably presented by Mr. I. D. Wood last evening In his presentation of home conditions on the farm, that phase of farm life has also been too generally over-looked and equally neglected. I am wondering If there is not a connection between 'poor Marketing and poor homes' and 'Improved Marketing and im - proved homes.' A good way to improve both is to study out a plan that will fill the bill, then get to work actively and carry out the plan: set up for yourself the desired goal: fix a mental picture of the things you want; or of yourself as you would wish to be. Keep this mental picture constantly before you and unconsciously you will be thinking those things and doing those things that will surely contribute to the reali - zation of the picture. Honest, aggressive men are naturally the result of honest and aggressive thinking and likewise, shiftlessness and lazi - ness are the results of indolent and lazy thinking; crookedness the result of crooked thinking. Force yourselves to think straight and ag - gressively and it is easy to live straight and aggressively. </seg>

A Cooperative organization must be based upon the "Give and Take" plan. Too many want to do all the "Taking" without their share of the "Giving' and this is not cooperation. The investment of time, energy and a little money in doing our bit towards the estab - lishment and building up of a Cooperative in our several states will return bigger profits than any investment we can possibly make and is bound to insure producers of farm products a much larger share of the profits made on their products. This can be accomplished in only one way and that is through organized selling — back up organized selling with a control over pro - duction and success is assured.

The average yield of potatoes under irrigation, is 1 probably about 150 bushels per acre. It is believed the average yield per acre for the irrigated land could be raised considerably with very little effort on the part of the grower. Very large yields are possible under irri - gation. During the past few years, several growers have produced over 1,000 bushels per acre. I will pass over the discussion of the production of good seed and its Importance in producing a good crop for I think we all realize that if maximum yields are secured, a seed piece of sufficient size to insure a vigorous plant must be used. The soil moisture at the time of planting Is of paramount im - portance. Seed will sprout in dry soil but roots will not grow unless the root hairs come in contact with moist soil. It is believed If there is not sufficient moisture in the soil to Insure good germination, moist - ure should be applied. At Greeley in our experimental ■ work, we have never failed to increase the germination by irrigating up when the soil was deficient </seg>
            <seg id="p676">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE in moisture at time of planting. The method of applying water is very important for much damage can be done if the moisture is not properly applied. It is believed that one may supply moisture to the soil at any time if moisture is needed, either before or after planting or at any time during the growth tf the plant until irrigation oper - ations should be suspended In the fall without damage to the plants or quality of the crop if the water is properly applied. During the past three years, we have been studying tuber de - velopment under irrigation and this year stolon studies have also been made in connection with this experiment. While the potato plant is still quite small, it begins to produce stolons from the various nodes along the stem underground. These stolons may grow to considerable length or they may be quite short Some varieties produce much longer stolons than others. Plants that produce a long stolon growth are generally termed "stolon - iferous." It la on these stolons or underground stems, that the tubers are produced. Work which we are continuing at the Greeley sta - tion, indicates that the amount of moisture supplied at the time the stolons are making their growth has a decided influence on the stolon length. June and July of this year were rather hot months in the Greeley district and very little rain fell, .96 of an inch being re - corded for June, and .41 of an Inch for July. Plots of Rural New Yorker were planted May 23, and plots of Triumphs, June 4. Three plots of Rurals and three plots of Triumphs were irrigated early in the season and three plots of each variety received the first appli - cation of water late in the season. After tuber development started in the various plots, a considerable number of hills were harvested every ten days and notes taken on stolon growth and tuber develop - ment. The average length of Rural stolons from the early irrigated plots was 8.48 millimeters, while the average length of Rural stolons from the late irrigated was 20.34 millimeters. The average length of Triumph stolon from the early irrigated plots was 59.81 millimeters while the average length of Triumph stolons from the late Irrigated plots was 95.64 millimeters. - . Results similar to those noted at the station on stolon length were also observed in the Greeley district In commercial fields and similar reports were received from other sections. It has been ob - served that if the stolons are long, they may be little or much branched and they may have few or many buds. We find as these buds begin to swell and grow, they form small tubers. The number of tubers per plant depends largely upon the number and length of stolons. We may find a very large number of small tubers about the fize of a garden pea about the time the tubers are beginning to set and it may appear that the set of tubers per plant will be very large That is not the case, however, for when we examined the plants fifteen or twenty days later or at the time of harvest, we find a much smaller set per hill than we did at the time the tubers were beginning </seg>
            <seg id="p677">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION to form. It will be observed that many of these small tubers turn dark, shrivel up and either decay or are partly absorbed by the plant. The Irrigation studies at Greeley indicate that early irrigation or applications of water sufficiently early to enable the plant to make an early, continuous, vigorous growth; results in an earlier set and an earlier development of tubers. The following table which is of the results secured in 1929, gives an idea of the effect of early and late applications of the initial irrigation on tuber development.

The early irrigated plots at the station have also produced the highest quality stock from a starch standpoint. For two years, tubers from these plots were sent to Dr. Oold - thwalte, research chemist of the Home Economics Department of the Colorado Agricultural College, and her report gives a higher starch content for the tubers from the early irrigated plots. Irrigation water, properly applied, does not Injure the quality of the potato, but </seg>
            <seg id="p678">REPORT OK NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE irrigation water may injure the quality of the crop if not wisely and properly used. The quality of the tubers may be injured where the amount of moisture in the soil does not remain fairly constant and an irregular supply of moisture may cause second growth or knotty potatoes and it may also result in growth cracks or hollow heart. A deficiency of moisture may cause the tubers to become pointed at the stem end and also result in a low yield. An over supply of moisture does not, as a rule, form oft-type tubers but it does produce large prominent lenticels and retards the growth and development of the tubers if the air is excluded from the soil and poor drainage or water left standing in the furrows always results in a decreased yield. i , It is very doubtful whether the temperature of the soil has any deciding influence on the type of tubers, although soil temperature no doubt has some influence on the yield. Irrigation water, when applied to the soil, has very little Influence on the soil temperature. The upper few inches of soil may be lowered a few degrees immed - iately following irrigation. The soil 6 or 7 inches under the surface may also be lowered one or two degrees, but in a few hours, the temperature drops back to the point maintained before the applica - tion of water. It does not seem reasonable to believe that 3 or 4 acre inches of water or even a larger amount applied to the soil could have any ; decided influence on the temperature of the earth, especially when the water has been conveyed any distance through irrigation canals, laterals and head' ditches. Temperatures recorded from a depth of seven inches in the early and late irrigated plots at the station this year have never varied over .1% degrees and that difference was only over a short period of time when one plot was irrigated and the other not irrigated. It is believed that the character of the soil has considerable in - fluence on the tjype of tubers, especially with some varieties. Some varieties produce off-type tubers on heavy soil, while in the same district, the same variety may produce tubers true to varietal type when grown in the light or sandy soil. For instance, in the Greeley district, the Pearl variety generally always produces oft-type knobby potatoes on the heavier types of soil but this variety produces good shaped tubers when grown in sandy soil. The Russett Burbanks or Netted Gem cannot be grown in the heavier soil of the Greeley dis - trict but growers with a sandy loam can produce good type Burbanks with proper irrigation. Because of the variation in type of surface and sub-soil, slope of ground, porosity of soil, rainfall and seasonal conditions, it would be impossible to recommend the application of a definite amount of irrigation water, the number of irrigations or the exact time to make the initial application. Rut it is believed that the following general rule may be recommended. Make the first application whenever it is necessary in order that the plants may make a continuous and </seg>

SOME FACTS CONCERNING THE PRODUCTIVITY OP IRRIGATED SEED POTATOES* H. O. WERNERf Department of Horticulture, Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station In many seed potato buying regions there is a more or less es - tablished prejudice against the use of irrigated seed stock. Concern - ing the cause of the inferiority claimed for irrigated seed potatoes, there are a number of suppositions, several of which will be men - tioned. A common one is that irrigated potato plants are "forced" more than are those on dry land and consequently their tubers are weaker and less productive. Another sup - position is that the tubers are injured rjtaH^^^^^^BHnHnl physiologically by the soaking they get : 5 ; v " J, 1* ? : i- .. &lt;! when the soil surrounding them is exces- ;; :■-- '' jl sively wet for a more or less prolonged if ■■ , I period.

            <seg id="p680">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Undoubtedly some poor yields have been secured In the south from western Irrigated seed lots. The same could be said of western dry land seed. On the basis of our present knowledge It seems that undoubtedly most or all of such lots of seed were infected with some virus disease, probably spindle-tuber. In earlier papers (Werner 4.S) in which the literature was re - viewed, the author concluded that there seemed to be no recorded Instance where irrigation was detrimental to healthy seed potatoes In several papers the author (Werner 4.6) has shown that irrigation conditions are very favorable for infection and spread of spindle - tuber. The only papers concerning irrigation of seed potatoes, com - ing to his notice since the previous papers were published are by Harrington. (1) who reports no significant difference between irri - eated and dry land seed and Schneider (3) who reports low moisture seed as having produced lower yields than high moisture seed. In one recently published paper the author (Werner 1929) has shown that when healthy seed potatoes were grown under controlled green - house conditions the amount of soil moisture in no instance sig - nificantly affected their productivity. In another paper (Werner (8)) data presented showed that apparently healthy tubers from the lower areas of a dry land field,— where vine growth was most rank due to increased moisture, were considerably less productive than those from the higher more drouthy areas. The difference was attributed to the greater percentage of spindle-tuber infection in the low land seed potatoes. Holden (2) ran irrigation water between rows of "run out" (spindle-tuber) potatoes and then used the surplus on healthy rows but secured no evidence that the irrigation water spread the disease! Experimental During the last few years considerable data have been assembled by the Nebraska Experiment Station, concerning the seed value of Irrigated potatoes produced from healthy stocks. Data derived from tests during earlier years when spindle-tuber was a factor are also Included in this paper in order to deal more fully with this question. Under western Nebraska conditions higher temperatures prevail in dry land than in irrigated soils, probably because of the smaller vine growth in the dry land fields and the less extensive evaporation from the soil surface. The author. has previously reported (5, 9,) that dry land grown potatoes are generally lighter in color and are relatively wider than the irrigated potatoes. Thruout the various experiments it has been observed that dry land potatoes, because of moisture shortage at the end of the season, are generally more ma - ture than irrigated potatoes. Probably because of this the dry land potatoes emerge from their dormant period at an earlier date and consequently may grow more promptly when planted. This may be a more vital factor in early southern plantings than in the late northern plantings. </seg>
            <seg id="p681">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION . .;■•■•■ .1 Comparison of Dry Land and Irrigated Seed Potatoes Spindle-tuber was a factor In the experiments conducted at Scotts - bluff prior to 1924. These have been reported In detail In previous publications. Beginning with 1923 seed potatoes were produced In isolated rogued seed plats In both dry land and irrigated fields. As a further precaution for preventing infection some plants were grown under insect proof cages. Since 1926 tuber-indexed potatoes have been used. These we consider free of virus diseases, particularly mosaic. Rep - resentative data concerning spindle-tuber Infected lots grown each year from 1918 to 1924 are presented in Table 1. These data reveal that the yield of seed potatoes irrigated only one year declined from C% to 75.8%. This rather great variation was due to the lots of seed originally having had different amounts 'of disease and having been exposed to different neighboring sources of infection. When a lot of seed was grown in irrigated fields for more than one year the disease increased and yield decreased with each successive year. All of these lots were seriously infected not only jwlth spindle-tuber but also with unmottled curly dwarf, as indicated by the "run out" tubers produced. Under these conditions the use of irrigated seed potatoes could not be justified. Table 1. Relation of Irrigation in .the presence and absence of the spindle-tuber disease at Scottsbluff, upon!

            <seg id="p683">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION With the healthy potatoes the yields from the Irrigated stocks were generally greater than those of the dry land stocks. (Table 1). These differences, however, were never very large, sometimes being less than the PE of the difference and never | being three times the PE of the difference. North Platto Experiments. At North Platte also, In the earlier txperlinents when splndle-tuber had not been eliminated, Irrigated stock was distinctly inferior (Table 2). The inferiority was relatively less than at Scottsbluff because the seed stock were less severely in - fected. When healthy seed potatoes were used there was no consistent difference in the yield of irrigated and dry land seed and the dif - ferences that did occur were smaller than the PE of these differences. Lincoln Experiments. Irrigation at Lincoln was provided by the overhead or sprinkler system. Only healthy potatoes were used, Out of 13 comparative sets of seed, irrigated seed was least productive in 9 cases and most productive in 4 cases, with a mean decrease of 3.2% (Table 3). These differences are too small to be statistically sig - nificant since In only 2 Instances out of the p in which PEs were calculated was the percentage difference more than three times the PE of the difference. Tests in Southern States. In 1929 tuber indexed Triumph dry land seed potatoes from Alliance and irrigated stock from Scottsbluff were planted In replicated plats by several of the southern Agricul - tural Experiment Stations. These potatoes were grown from seed stock that had been tuber indexed in the winter of 1926-27. This line of seed is apparently free of mosaic, spindle-tuber and all other virus diseases. At Hastings, Florida, the dry land and irrigated lots' gave prac - tically the same yield. At Weslaco, Texas, in Arkansas and in Ne - braska the irrigated seed was most productive whereas in Oklahoma and Alabama the dry land seed gave highest yields. However, in only one case (Texas) was the difference statistically significant. Apparent - ly such differences as tuber size, maturity, . and degree of dormancy, or season and place of planting comparative plats were of little con - sequence when considering their effect on relative yield of dry land ' and Irrigated potatoes. Effect ol Amount of Water Upon Seed Potato Quality Triumph seed potatoes were produced with different quantities of water at Scottsbluff and In the greenhouse at Lincoln in order to determine whether the amount of water had any effect upon seed quality. The potatoes thus produced were p anted In plats in west - ern Nebraska. ■ ■ » i </seg>

            <seg id="p686">J REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Scottsbluff Tests — Spindle-tuber Present. In 1922, plants from the same 20 supposedly healthy Triumph potatoes were grown on dry land and with 6 different types of irrigation, one seed piece from each tuber having been planted in each plat. Late in the season it was discovered that the plants from four of these tubers were in - fected with spindle-tuber. Table 5. Relation of irrigation methods to the seed value of a lot of seed infected with spindle-tuber, Scottsbluff, 1922-23.

In 1923 an equal number of seed pieces out of the same tuber lines from each of the plats were planted. The irrigated seed yielded from 16.0 to 50.2% less than the dry; land seed. The difference be - tween the spindle-tuber content of irrigated and dry land stocks, as indicated by relative tuber type was sufficient to account for this dif - ference. The amount of irrigation water or the method of applying It apparently was not responsible for any consistent or important dif - ferences in the seed value of the potatoes produced. Spindle-tuber — as indicated by tuber type deterioration, — increased with similar rapidity under all irrigation conditions, and apparently was respon - sible for the decreased yields. Practically the same results were secured with two other very similar experiments conducted from 1920 to 1922. Lincoln- Alliance Tests: Healthy seed produced in greenhouse. The soil moisture in which potatoes were grown in the greenhouse at Lincoln was varied with different sets so as to provide three general rates. Both early maturing and a medium maturing type of Triumph potatoes were used. The low moisture plants frequently were in a wilted condition while in the high moisture series a constant water table was maintained twelve inches below the surface of the soil. Detail data concerning this and other similar experiments have al - ready been published (Werner 1929). When planted in comparative plats at Alliance the high moisture plants emerged most slowly, the low moisture plants most rapidly. </seg>
            <seg id="p687">I NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION I This was probably due to the difference in the| degree of dormancy. Both high and medium moisture seed lots outyielded the low moisture lots (Table 6) but these increases did not appear to have much sta - tistical significance. Undoubtedly the larger seed pieces planted from the medium moisture lots were responsible for some of the increaesd yield recorded. ■ ■ - ■' ■•■ I • • i '-:i: Table 6.

These data and those from several similar! experiments indicate that when disease is eliminated and other factors are considered, the amount of soil moisture with which the seed potatoes are produced does not affect their productivity. • ... Discussion Apparently when diseases (especially virus diseases) are elim - inated as factors, dry land and irrigated seed potatoes are practically equally productive. However, in order to grow seed potatoes that will meet the demands of a critical seed market, irrigation farmers must adopt practices somewhat different than those commonly used In producing table potatoes. Generally speaking the Triumph seed market demands that the potatoes (1) be relatively free from all diseases, (2) be small to medium in size, that is, from about 2 or 3 to 8 or 10 ounces, and (3) be carefully sorted and packed according to standards of the U. S. No. 1 grade (with exceptions as to size). In order to grow seed potatoes of very low disease content prob - ably the best practice is to plant only those lots of seed that have </seg>
            <seg id="p688">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE shown very low disease readings, in the field the previous year and in southern trial plats. This is especially important when the spindle-tuber disease is present. At the present time no lots of seed containing over 1% of splndle-tuber should be planted in irrigated seed fields. When a new seed lot is procured the important factor to consider is the history with regard to disease, rather than the place and method of culture used in producing it. The irrigation grower will need to pay special attention to the isolation of his seed plats and potato fields, and to .the control of insect carriers of disease. He should also remove diseased plants by early and frequent rogueing. Indexed Triumph seed stocks,, that have been increased by careful growers, are the most desirable seed source. How long it will be. advisable to grow such lots continuously under irrigation will de - pend upon the various factors previously mentioned. The size of the tubers may be controlled within reasonable limits by either regulating the time and amount of irrigation water or the amount of seed planted. By early irrigation the set of tubers is increased and consequently the average tuber size is decreased. The objections to reducing the amount of water are that per acre pro - duction is thereby reduced and thai this method does not always work well since rainfall cannot be controlled. . By increasing the amount of seed planted per acre the number of tubers is increased, the total yield is increased and the average size of the tubers is re - duced. This can be accomplished by planting either large seed pieces far apart or smaller pieces close together. The latter practice has been found to be most efficient. On fertile irrigated soils the maxi - mum planting distance for Triumph seed potato, production should be 12 inches apart in' rows 36 inches apart. With seed pieces weigh - ing one ounce this planting rate will require 15 bushels per acre. This should be considered an absolute minimum. Planting 1% to. 2 oz. seed pieces at distances of 8 or 10 inches in rows 30 or 32 inches apart will be found more profitable in increasing the bushels of seed size potatoes. This will increase seed costs but will decrease' sorting costs and will increase the amount of seed potatoes that can be sold advantageously. The customary difference in maturity of dry land and irrigated seed potatoes may sometimes be a factor affecting early southern plantings. However, the data thus far secured indicate that this aspect has not been very important. If future tests show that con - dition of maturity or seed dormancy are important factors, then it may be advisable to adjust storage conditions accordingly for irri - gated seed potatoes. Summary 1. When splndle-tuber was present in seed stocks irrigated seed potatoes degenerated, as to productivity and quality of tubers, much more rapidly than did dry land grown stocks. This. deterioration of the irrigated seed stock increased with each additional year of irrigation. </seg>

            <seg id="p700">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE POULTRY IMPOVEMENT ASSOCIATION DUDLEY BECK, President, Decatur D. Z. HOLCOMB, Secretary, Clay Center The following papers were given at a meeting of the Poultry Improvement Association held during Organized Agriculture week, January 6 to 9th, Inclusive, at the Agricultural College, Lincoln, Nebraska: FACTORS AFFECTING FERTILITY AND HATCHABILITY F. E. MUS9EHL — University of Nebraska The job of renewing the poultry flocks of Nebraska is a big one as we can well understand when we realize that we have a permanent poultry population of at least fourteen million birds at the present time. Our annual chick requirements in Nebraska are about forty million chicks for which at the present time we incubate about 70 million eggs either with hens, with small Incubators, or in mammoth hatcheries. From these hatching experiences we sometimes hear of extraordinary hatches of 85 or 90 per' cent of all eggs set. Such experiences are so unusual that we talk about them and remember them for the same reason, I suppose, that we remember the year of the big blizzard and the year of the big tornado. If, however, we take the average of a large number of hatching reports, we find that 60 chicks from every 100 eggs set is probably about the average for the state. That means that about thirty million eggs which were hopefully put in our incubators failed to -deliver chicks as expected. At even 24 cents per -dozen, or two cents per egg, the loss of these eggs represent a waste which we should try to reduce as far as possible, Hatcherymen and flock owners know that there is a difference in the hatching power of eggs at different seasons. of the year and from Ft-ason to season in flocks that apparently are handled in similar ways on the same farm. Unfortunately we cannot explain all of the varying experiences, but we do now know something about" the mysteries of the vitamins, ultra violet radiation and the hereditary factors so that we can today make a more intelligent guess than could the poultry man of twenty-five years ago. This problem of fertility and hatchability is of course an exceedingly complicated one, influenced by a good many different factors which is one reason why we do not have perfect, clean cut answers for all the questions emanating from it. In general we can, however, classify the influences into feeding factory, manage - ment factors and breeding factors. In some of the experimental work which has been done at other stations the nutritional factors and the </seg>
            <seg id="p701">NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION management factors have been studied together and as a matter of fact, It ts rather difficult in actual practice to consider them separately. Rations for Breeders The miracle of the vitamins is now at least partly understood by most poultry producers. There are of course still many unanswered questions about vitamins, but in general we know about their sources and the effects of their deficiencies. Incubation is fundamentally a nutritional phenomenon, and therefore it is important that the egg which contains the nutrient material for starting the chick must have all the essential vitamin factors. One principle which is now recog - nized in nutrition research is that a ration which is complete in all essentials except one may give poor results in fertility and hatchability. Rations must be complete with respect to Vitamins A, B, and D, and perhaps also to two new vitamin factors which have tentatively been designated as E and F. Sources of Vitamins A and B Yellow corn and legume hays, including alfalfa and clover, are the richest sources of the vitamin A factor. Midst all the indefinite - ness about the feeding problem we do know these two definite facts, — that yellow corn is for poultry a better feed tfian is white corn and that alfalfa or clover should be included in the ration for breeders. Alfalfa meal can be included in the dry mash mixture (from 5 to &amp;%) or alfalfa hay can be fed in a rack or trough before the birds at all times during the winter months. When the growing season begins there is of course nothing better for breeding birds than green alfalfa, green clover, blue grass or similar succulent green feeds. These same green feeds also contain large amounts of vitamin B as do also most of the grains and milling by-produpts, especially wheat shorts. Recent experimental work points to the conclusion that germ - inated oats are rich in the vitamin factors and are especially useful in the breeding flock ration for that reason. In West Virginia Agri - cultural Experiment Station Bulletin Number 178 (published in 1922) this conclusion based on careful experimental work is reached. "Sprouted oats added to a typical winter laying ration definitely in - creased fertility and hatching power of eggs produced." Vitamin D The relatively recent discovery of the importance of vitamin D, or ultra violet radiation, has been one of the! miracles of the ages. When a pane of glass is shown to make the difference between success and failure in growing chicks, we cannot help but be impressed with the Importance of this vitamin factor. In a report published by the Ohio Experiment Station workers in 1924, covering work done for several previous seasons, the report is made that hatchability was </seg>
            <seg id="p702">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE increased from 35 to 65 per cent by allowing the breeding flock to run on a range of blue grass or rye. Perhaps the blue grass and rye contributed some essential vitamins, but we can also expect that the ultra violet radiation absorbed when the birds were out in the yards had a lot of influence on hatchability. In West Virginia Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin Number 178 (1922) this statement de - scribes the results of one experiment, — "Confining hens to their houses during the two winters covered by this report proved detrimental to the number of eggs produced and to their hatchability." Cod liver oil Is of course a substitute for direct sunshine but only a substitute. When the ration is complete for vitamin A, and when even so little as two hours of good clear sunshine per week are avail - able, it is doubtful whether cod liver oil is necessary. The cost of a small amount is slight, however, and for safety's sake it may be well to include one-half per cent In the mash given the breeding flocks during January and February. Mineral Elements Good hatching eggs must of course have good shell texture. The calcium carbonate needed for shell making can be furnished with high grade limestone grit or oyster shells which should be furnished in a box or hopper kept before them at all times. This with a little bone meal usually furnished in sufficient quantity when 10 per cent of meat and bone meal is used in the ration, and one-half of one per cent of finely pulverized salt will meet all requirements for supplemental mineral matter. The addition of so-called complete mineral mixtures to the laying flock or breeding flock ration Is of very doubtful value. Shell Texture and Hatchability The condition of a hen may of course change somewhat from day to day, so the hatching power of her eggs may change also. The size and texture of the egg laid Is probably as good an indicator of the physical condition of the hen as can be found. There is really a great deal of merit to the practice of picking only the sound, fine textured eggs for hatching. Chicks from such eggs will have a better chance than those from eggs with poor size, shape and texture. Dr. Dunn, now of Columbia University, formerly of Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, has made some very interesting studies of the relationship of shape and weight of eggs to their hatching power. He found that eggs weighing near the average for the flock hatched better than either the small or the very large ones. Protein Quality and Hatchability So far as we know no one has studied the effect of the protein content of the ration on hatching power. In one Ohio bulletin we find the statement (Ohio Bimonthly Bulletin — Vol. XIII, No. 6 — 1928) </seg>
            <seg id="p703">NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION that the addition of milk to the particular basal ration used increased hatchability 10 per cent. Further than this no experimental work is reported. One point on which there- is general agreement is that the hatch - ing power of eggs is always best when the flock is increasing in pro - duction. The amount of protein in the ration influences the rate of production quite definitely of course. Flocks which are to be managed chiefly for breeding purposes should be kept on a rather low protein plane until January 1st, after which the protein can be increased so that egg production will be on the increase each week until March 1st. Exercise is Important One hears quite- a bit about all mash feeding of laying hens, and evidently some are having good success with this method. For breed - ing flocks we are inclined to urge some litter feeding to encourage exercise which we know to be essential to the maintenance of good vigor. Boil all the theories and practical ideas on breeding flock management down into the fewest words, and we would have this statement, — "Maintain vigor." Anything that will help to maintain high vigor will be helpful in getting good fertility and hatching power. The feeding of from two-fifths to one-half of the ration in good clean litter is desirable for that reason. • . : ■ Genetic Factors . Affecting Hatchability One rather comprehensive study has been made on "The Inherit - ance of Fertility and Hatchability In Poultry" by Dr. Hays and R. Sanborn of the Massachusetts Agricultural Experiment Station. Their data cover a study of thousands of birds and tens of thousands of eggs and chicks hatched. Among the conclusions stated are: I "First, fertility In the hen behaves as an Individual characteristic with a fair degree of constancy from year to year. Second, fertility does not appear to be transmitted from mother to daughter. Fertility and hatching power are in this study treated as separate factors. Third, hatching power is probably transmitted from mother to daugh - ter. Fourth, hatchability Is more constant from year to year In the same male than Is fertility. - . </seg>
            <seg id="p704">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE FIFTY OR FIVE HUNDRED HENS By J. R. REDDITT "It's getting harder and harder for a farmer to make any money on chickens," related a farmer visitor recently. "How so and why pick on the poultry, business?" he was asked. "Well," said he with some impatience, "these near town and city poultrymen who make chickens just a hobby ruin a farmer's market. Poultry is a lot of bother, it takes a lot of time and then may not amount to anything if they don't lay or if they get sick. Seems like we are entitled to this business and all we can make at it." "About the near town poultry raiser ruining the farmer's market, just how do you explain that, and what about farmers spoiling their own market?" he was asked. "Poultry folks in town have other work that makes them a living so it doesn't matter whether the chickens pay or not. It is like golf with them, it's just pastime. As for our ruining our own market that can't be. We are doing as we always have done." "We seldom see back yard flocks any more, so they are not to blame. You say farmers are doing as they always have and that's the trouble with too many. In this age of specialization it's hard for anyone to make much If any profit by practicing out of date methods." "Yes, I guess that's right," he agreed, "but who then is furnishing poultry and eggs to folks in' town and are they making a profit?" "Large flocks of commercial size, 500 to 1,000 hens. The owners are farmers who have found that they can conduct their poultry busi - ness more satisfactorily and profitably on an enlarged scale. In this age of progress- we can't stand still. We are left out if we do. It's either go ahead or go back. If these flocks make an annual net profit of $1.50 to' $2.00 per hen wouldn't you think profits had influenced them as much as hobby?" he was asked next. "Whoever heard of anyone making a net profit of $2.00 per hen on chickens? You must mean a total income of $2.00?" he parried. At this point I called attention to the record of a farm flock owner living near Lincoln, Nebraska, whose flock of 549 hens started gave him a gross return of $2,275.91 and from a strictly market standpoint, that is, no hatching eggs or breeding stock was sold. In looking over this record it was noted that the average price received for the eggs was around twelve cents per dozen, higher than the farmer had received for his eggs. This flock owner has enlarged his flock to 1,050 hens and is meet - ing with marked success. As proof the production from his flock dur - ing the second week of January, 1930, was a trifle over ten cases of eggs. These eggs are retailed at 45 cents per dozen, which means </seg>
            <seg id="p705">NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION I" $135.00 for the week. This will also explode the theory that present day consumers want a cheap or low priced product. Records from seven other large or commercial flocks averaging 500 hens each or a total of 3,576, have recently been analyzed. The combined gross income from all these hens was J15.243.49. The gross receipts were $4.26 per hen started or $5.19 per average hen. Costs amounted to about $3.00 for each hen. Feed costs amounted to only a trifle over half of the total. Litter, rent I and depreciation, on stock and equipment are among other items of cost which while fre - quently ignored are not to be overlooked. These records were for ,the«rear of 1929. Some 190 records from the average sized flock are being analyzed. Indications are that the majority of these are losing money. A few are about breaking even and some are making a profit. Throughout the study it appears that it is the large flock owner whose flock is large enough to command respect that is making a profit. Small flocks are at a decided disadvantage in the production and sale of surplus. Because the flock is small there! isn't enough surplus to justify the attention that must be given to products that are in demand. In this age of specialization it is well to keep in mind that the successful poultry business of today is a highly specialized indus - try. The world is moving, ideas are changing, and with all standards of living are being raised constantly. In spite ofj these rapid changes it may be noted that the majority of poultry raisers have been slow in adopting newer methods. We may note also that only those who have taken to modern practices are really making any money out or their flocks. The majority of farm flocks in Nebraska are small. Because of this the labor cost of getting the product to market is greater. At the same time there is more delay which Impairs) the quality. In the New England states small grain js grown in little patches varying in size from one-half to five acres, 'and these scattered all over a hilly rocky half section. To us such would seem almost childish, especially If cut with hand scythes and finally put on the market in competition with western grain. In our Nebraska poultry production methods we are dabbling away our time in about such a fashion. The sad feature is that we insist upon staying like this when our poultry advantages entitle us to assume in poultry the same rank and dignity that char - acterizes us as grain growers and cattle raisers. Natural advantages of Nebraska for poultry raising include an abundance of sunshine, cheaper home grown feeds (grains and pack - ing house by-products), quicker transportation or shorter haul and apparently a lower death rate of laying hens. The few commercial flocks in Nebraska from which complete records have been kept show the death loss to be less than ten per cent. Indications are that both the Atlantic and Pacific Coast states suffer losses pf more than double </seg>

Just as cattle, hogs, and the packing industry are found where the feed is grown, so ought the poultry and egg business to be located, and commercially developed where feed is produced. Cooperative marketing is the chief ingredient in the Federal Farm Board's prescription for the cure of the farm problem. We are told in most emphatic terms that our present- marketing methods are waste - ful and that waste must be eliminated before there can be any profit. As an example of what can be accomplished, our attention is directed to the cooperative marketing enterprises of the Pacific Coast. The largest single poultry and egg marketing organization of yiis kind is at San Francisco, California. This association now handles more than $13,000,000.00 worth of poultry and eggs annually. An - other in Washington does an annual business almost as great. The growth of these associations has been phenomenal, yet for two. major reasons it is easy to understand and appreciate the progress they have made. First, production costs have been reduced. The co-ops have been set up and operated on an efficiency basis. This has been the watch - word all along the line. Members of these co-op associations are pro - ducing eggs at a few cents less per dozen than we of the middle west. We are told that one cent less in production costs is equivalent to two cents more in selling price. Second, the selling price is greater. A more desirable product is offered the consumer who willingly pays more for it. We who think the American people want a second rate food product are mistaken. Eggs from the Pacific Coast, when sold along with eggs from the mid-west, bring several cents more per dozen. And this in no sense is unfair price discrimination. The eggs are worth more. They are fresh, clean, infertile, large and uniform in size, shape and color. A third reason can be made by adding the first and second. The sum would be greater profits. The Pacific Coast poultry and egg business is growing. It 1b growing rapidly and soundly. We of the middle west with more nat - ural advantages in our favor wake up occasionally long enough to grumble our dissatisfaction, blame Wall Street, the dealers, the con - sumer, and everyone or anyone we can. And that's about all that's done. But more must be done if we accomplish anything or offer our friends on the west any real competition.

Our buyers are specifically stating their wants in very clear terms. An excellent market is awaiting whoever can meet the consumer's demand, but woe unto whoever tries to pan off any inferior products. Every railroad operating In Nebraska (all states no doubt) pro - vides fast refrigerator freight service to the east. This makes it possible for poultrymen in sections more remote or where markets are poor to ship direct to eastern buyers. The cost of shipping eggs from Nebraska amounts to five or six cents per dozen to New York The cost to Chicago is slightly lower. : Already there are some who are finding this a solution to one of their major marketing problems. Express shipments are also common from many localities. The main objection to this method is the cost, which usually amounts to about twice as much as freight rates Any - one contemplating the shipping of eggs by either freight or express could secure all the necessary information from the local freight or express agent. . ' From flocks of 500 hens laying at the rate of 40 per cent, three cases of good eggs could be shipped each week. An average size flock of 125 hens would not produce one good case of eggs a week. Ship - ments of less than a case would certainly be wasteful. Shipments at intervals of more than one week would mean stale eggs going to market and the market wants only fresh eggs. * Most farm poultry raisers throughout the country have evidently been unaware of the increasing exactness of the poultry business. Production and marketing methods must be directed toward quality products. The consumer has, in dollars and cenU, expressed a de - cided preference for products of high quality. Asia result any effort to force inferior goods upon the ever discriminating consumer has been at a sacrifice to the producer. What Is more and worse, the whole industry suffers a black eye. </seg>

As a means of helping Nebraska poultry raisers know of the benefits or profits to be derived from the commercial sized flock, the Extension Service of the College of Agriculture has outlined a commercial record flock project for the larger flock owners' use in keeping a more accurate check upon the flock. This is a poultry cost account project. It permits an accurate analysis of factors that have contributed to the profit or loss of the flock. Unless we can under - stand these things we are going into it blindly, and that certainly is not recommended in .these times of efficiency and competition. This project is underway in nine counties in Nebraska at present. MODERN POULTRY EQUIPMENT J. H. CLAYBAUGH When one begins to make an analysis of his poultry problems he soon writes down two which can be marked perennial. These are the problems of keeping death losses low and rate of production high. Upon a little closer examination a third problem shows itself. This problem Is one of reducing labor costs. In discussing the subject ot modern poultry equipment I hope to oring out the relationship which equipment has to these problems of death losses, rate of production, and labor costs. In preparing for this discussion I have made a study of poultry equipment exhibited and offered for sale by manufacturers. I am referring to equipment seen in use on many farms visited. I am also keeping in mind the suggestions gathered while attending poultry meetings throughout the state. The equipment being used for the care of baby chicks has changed during the last few years. Many have adopted the all mash system of feeding chicks. It is obvious that mash should not be fed on the floor or allowed to mix with the filth on the floor if the first principle of sanitation is to be followed. The young chicks are able to bill out feed from many troughs and feeders. On several occasions I have seen more bran than litter on the floor of the brooder house. Mash on the floor is an economic waste. It is also one means whereby disease germs are spread. To avoid chicks eating wasted mash some folks have adopted the screen covered platform. These platforms show the amount of feed .beflig wasted and also prevents chicks from eating the feed that has become mixed with the filth on the brooder house floor. </seg>
            <seg id="p709">NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION Thus the kind of equipment used to feed baby chicks may have a direct bearing upon the spread of disease within the brooder Waste proor feeders are needed to prevent death losses. The amount of feeder space needed for a brood of chicks has not been worked out to mathematical exactness. If only enough feeder •space is offered for half the brood to get what feed 'hey need for maximum growth then the entire brood will not grow as fast as they snould and some underfed runts will develop. As chicks grow they spread out sideways and fewer chicks can eat from the same trough m«.us the amount of feeder space to use in a brooder house will vary but should be enough so all the chicks will get what feed they need for the maximum growth rate desired. The heat within the brooder house plus the moisture around a leaking water container makes almost an ideal place for the growth and spread of certain disease germs. To avoid chicks from scratching in this moistened litter the hardware cloth covered platform for the water crock has become almost a necessity for many careful managers who are trying to decrease death losses. The sun porch is a piece of modern equipment that has developed recently. A sun porch in front of the brooder house provides a sare way of getting chicks out into direct sunshine. It also tempers the chicks so they become used to the outdoor temperatures. Getting away from the artificial heat within the brooder house seems to have a stimulating affect upon growth. To illustrate how modern equipment helps to reduce death losses I might tell a storey that came to my attention last summer. To substitute for a sun parlor a lady was using a ring of poultry netting in front of the brooder house. While absent from home the wire became unfastened and the poults within were blown by the wind and scattered. Often the value of poultry lost by the accidents due to the lack of equipment far surpasses the original cost of good equipment. We pay for equipment whether we have it or not. During the summer months the growing pullets are often badly neglected. It seems almost impossible to have more than 100 growing pullets roosting in a 10x12 foot brooder house without some roupy conditions developing. The more crowding and the less ventilation we have the more supper roup develops. To provide for additional roosting space during the summer when pullets or breeding cockerels are still out on range, the shelter shed has been used with success at all of the corn belt agricultural colleges. To supply the pullets on range with a full ration takes too much labor if one does not have the right kind of equipment for feeding and watering. As soon as people realize the value of keeping feed before the pullets and how easy this can be done with bungalow outdoor feeders we predict a greatly increased use of these safe and labor saving feeders. </seg>
            <seg id="p710">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE _ The four foot feed troughs for pullets which take the place of the small ones used for chicks are very useful for feed or water, both within and outside of the brooder house. These pieces of modern equipment for summer care of growing pullets are needed to assure a decrease in summer roup and worm infestation and to secure a more rapid growth and even development of the pullets. In our extension work with County Agents we endeavor to establish demonstrations of modern poultry houses and equipment which is to serve as patterns for others to follow. The fall meetings deal with equipment needed for the laying hens. A resume of the equipment built for these demonstrations will be of interest to those who will attend future meetings. These demonstrations are held where old houses are being remodeled or new Nebraska type houses are built. The equipment in these houses are such that saves labor in caring for a flock of hens, that keeps the feed and water clean to help promote the health of the hens, and induces a heavy consump - tion of feed which aids in increasing production. The drop boards and roosts are made movable so that they can be easily moved to a new house if needed. They are eo constructed as to be easy to clean and difficult for mites to find hiding places. The nests are made removable for easy cleaning and painting. They can be closed during the evening to prevent chickens from roosting in them. A broody coop, is built above the tier of nests. It is easy to pull a cluck from the nest and place her in the broody coop. In this coop the hens are comfortable and well fed so that a minimum of time is necessary . to break up the clucks. The feed storage bin saves a great many steps and seems to be an aid to assure the filling of mash troughs when empty. The mash is fed in open troughs and at least three four-foot troughs are provided for each 20x20 foot unit. The water stand elevates the water to the level of the mash troughs and above the level of the floor litter. The alfalfa feed rack is built movable and provides a clean way of offering this valuable feed to the biddies. A discussion of poultry equipment is not complete unless the definition is given as to what constitutes a modern house. Basing the description on the new Nebraska type house we might give these essentials. A modern poultry house is one' in which the birds can be kept comfortable in the different seasons. In a modern house the hazards causing losses should be reduced to the minimum. There should be no wasted effort in caring for the birds. The equipment should be such as to keep feed and water clean and allow every bird a chance to eat and drink. Construction should be such that direct sunshine is made available on the floor of the house. To get these essentials, new houses are being built with insulated walls and ceiling, a smooth permanent water proof floor, windows so arranged that light is fairly well distributed over the floor, openings so made as to allow </seg>
            <seg id="p711">NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION for cooling during hot weather, and closed as needed at other times, and all openings screened sparrow tight. The modern poultryman studies new equipment with these three things In mind. He hopes that he can find some improvement in his efforts to keep feed and water clean and thus prevent losses from diseases and parasite infection. He wants equipment which will pro - vide a constant supply of feed and induce heavy feed consumption so that he may expect rapid growth of the young stock and a profitable egg production from matured females. Lastly, the modern poultry - man seeks equipment which reduces the time and labor of doing routine chores and allows one man to care for more birds. We trust that this discussion will stimulate poultrymeni to study their own equipment and learn the relationship of modern equipment to low death losses, high production, and less labor costs. WHEN DO WE WANT OUR BABY CHICKS? By A. E. EXLEY, Lincoln, Nebr. The past few years have seen a great change in the time of year when we want our baby chicks. It is but a short time ago that we all wanted our baby chicks around the first day of May, and if our fries y^ere large enough to market for the Fourth of July we considered that we were doing very well. The pullets came Into laying about December and we did not expect many eggs until the first warm spells of Spring. Winter eggs were very scarce, and to be able to gather a few Hairing this time of year waa. indeed a result of which to be proud. This program for the raising of chicks was copied from the hen. We merely adopted her way of doing and assumed that she knew her business, and that if we followed In her footsteps we would be far more successful. One of the slogans of the poultry business was to get the chicks out on the ground just as soon as possible. There was supposed to be some magic power In having the chick come inj contact with Mother Earth jUBt aa soon as it could. We had to adjust our hatching pro - gram to the weather in order that the chicks might be able to do this, and whenever we were caught with a bunch of chicks and the weather turned cold and rainy for several days jwe were Just out or luck. Leg weakness would develop and we felt that nothing could be done until the weather would change and they could get out. I remember very well our experiences in trying to raise a brood of chicks earlier than the generally accepted time. These chicks did very well for about a week and then we had a nice snow storm and </seg>
            <seg id="p712">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE the drifts were as high as the brooder house. This compelled the chicks to remain inside for about three weeks, and such a sight as these checks were at the end of that time. They could hardly Btand up and their eyes swelled and big lumps of a cheese like nature formed in them. Finally we noticed where someone claimed that by the feeding of cod liver oil the chances for success In the raising of early chicks would be much greater. We decided that we would try it out for it could do no more than to kill the balance of the chicks and they were dying fast enough as it was. We made a special trip to town and purchased a small size bottle of cod liver oil at the drug store. There were no instructions as to the best way to give it so we mixed it with the drinking water. Of course it floated on the water and we had a lot of trouble in learning just what was the best way to feed it. But our chicks gradually stopped dying, and I feel that cod liver oil is one of the big factors in advancing the baby chick season. We are now able to raise chicks most successfully by keeping them off the ground entirely until they are six or eight weeks old. The weather has little or no effect upon the success which one will have. A good brooder house, a dependable brooder stove, the right feed, and the proper sanitary measures will Insure just as good success in January as in May. In fact, chicks are easier to raise early in the season than they are later. The weather is not so changeable and the heat can be regulated with much less attention; The chicks themselves, do not become so restless as they do later In the spring and are perfectly content to enjoy life inside the brooder house. I am of the opinion that the chick season for the majority of people starts with February and ends with the first of June, and I further think that the best season is during the first half of this period. Give me the earlier chicks every time. It is very surprising what a big difference a few weeks will make in the way the pullets will develop; Instead of getting the first small pullet eggs the last of the year as was the way under the old system of chick raising, we now get them in the late summer and early fall. With proper feeding these pullets will be producing large quantities of number one eggs right during the season of peak prices. Surely this one fact alone should be enough to make every poultry raiser want to get his chicks started as soon as he possibly can. The larger poultry raisers have been following this plan of early hatching for the past few years and have found it very successful. Now many of the farmers will give It a trial and theyj in turn will be pleased also. However, some are going to be so highly pleased with the results which are obtained, and the ease with which their chicks are raised that they will be tempted to raise . another brood later on in the spring. Someone else is going to try and raise a brood of heavy birds Ipr broilers early In the season and then raise </seg>
            <seg id="p713">NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION a second brood of some lighter breed for his winter laying flock. Ex - perience would seem to advise against this. The ordinary farmer who has but one brooder house should raise only one brood of chicks and they should be the 1 ones which he intends to keep for his laying flock the next winter. Just as sure as the first brood is moved to some other building arid the main attention of the caretaker is centered on a younger brood in the brooder house, trouble will begin. The damp cold days and the spring rains come on and these older chicks are without any artificial heat. The building itself has no doubt been used for old birds at some time, and these young sters which gave such promise just a short time ago will mysteriously become droopy and losses are sure to follow. The brooder house will be cleaned. to be sure, but not as thor - oughly as for the first chicks. The weather win be milder and they will be out on the ground at an earlier age. In this manner they will become, prey to troubles which did not bother the older chicks at all. Every older chicken on the place will take delight in running over the little fellows and eating their feed. Later hatches of chicks just do not do well on a farm where there is one brooder house, or more than one either for that matter, if the houses are at all near each other. We have several brooder houses and they are quite a distance apart too, but whenever we have later chicks in any of them they never do nearly as well as the first ones did. If they should accidently do well they are stunted the minute they get on the ground, because the older ones get the best of them. I There is one other way of raising two broods of chicks in the same brooder house which, according to my experiences, can not be done successfully. Last season a man bought j three hundred chicks i re in us and every time we saw him he told of the good luck which he was having with his chicks. His losses had been very few and ihey were growing at a great rate. After about a month I met him one day and he did not mention a word about the chicks, so I figured that something' had gone wrong. A visit to his farm revealed that he hud been so encouraged over the success he had with the first three hundred chicks that he had taken inch mesh wire and divided his brooder house into two parts. On one side of the partition was the remainder of the original three hundred chicks which were now over a month old, and on the other side was. the remainder of three hun - dred additional baby chicks which he thought he could raise with .the same brooder stove. My suggestion is to raise all the chicks which your house and equipment will care for adequately and no more. If you want to raise more chicks provide yourself with the additional equipment.

He has an entirely different program than the rest of us and can do successfully things which we should not even attempt. PERSONAL EXPERIENCES IN TURKEY RAISING By MRS. J. J. DONAHUE, Inland, Nebr. No longer is there any doubt as to the possibility of successful turkey rearing In any part of Nebraska. By the observation of proper sanitation measures anyone can raise turkeys. The "3 C" system — clean feed, clean water, clean range— worked out by Professor Mussehi and Doctor Van Es at our agricultural college Insures success if care - fully followed. - The Agricultural College of Nebraska has been a turkey production center for several years, but it has been only within the last three years that the people out-state have attempted to apply college methods to their turkey flocks. Those who have vigilantly used the "3 C" system are thoroughly convinced of the soundness of its principles. Our own state experiment station has been a pioneer in turkey investigational work. Turkey bulletins from the Nebraska College of Agriculture are quite complete. Fo'r the mid-west turkey grower it is doubtful If more reliable information, covering as much work, or as long a period can be had. Other essential factors in profitable . turkey production are arti - ficial Incubation and artificial brooding of the poults. By using these means, the turkey hen is kept at her legitimate business of laying eggs. Larger numbers of poults can be hatched and cared for as a unit, and birds so hatched are free from mites, lice, and intestinal parasites. The complete and continued separation of the young turkeys from chickens, old turkeys, and from range used by other poultry is a safeguard against blackhead. The value of this precaution cannot be overestimated. In the past few years, the supply of turkeys has been low, prices were good and profits were very satisfactory. Comparatively few people were engaged in the business. At present, interest in turkeys has revived due principally to the fact that modern methods of production have made the work successful. Because of increased production, the future of the business holds problems for solution which in the past caused us no concern. ' The present market situation Is bad. Chickens at 12c, turkeys at 18c, if not a distinct loss at least return no labor wage. The situation is, however, unusual and there is every logical reason for believing It to be only transitory — that prices will come back and poultry production will go on uninterrupted. </seg>
            <seg id="p715">Nebraska state poultrv association In defiance of low prices, turkey production in Nebraska can be made to yield profit. To accomplish this many things must be ob - served—Production costs must be studied, a strain of good market turkey, must be developed that will be prolific layers, that will mature into market size at five or six months of agf Care must be used h hV 6 eC , ° f ' he breedlQ e 8t ° ck - We feed a yellow-skinned, broad-backed, wide-breasted, deep bodied type, not too long bodied or rangy. These birds must have finish when slaughtered, must be nicely dressed for a select market. Perhaps a narration of the writer's persolal experiences with a small flock may establish an idea of possible accomplishment on a larger scale. ■ Beginning in 1927 with a unit of four hens and one torn. 82 turkeys were raised. The market birds were sold at 35c per pound averaging $4.60 each. In 1928, from a breeding flock of 14 hens 167 , r( !L Were rai8ed " L ° SSeS Were 8U8talned year through the failure of 400 early eggs to hatch and toll taken by a hail storm. 123 birds were marketed in 1928 again at 35c per pound, with an average of 14.40 per fowl. The feed expense these two years was low, owing to the plentiful supply of green alfalfa and grasshoppers, both of which appeal strongly to turkey appetites. No turkey eggs were sold in 1927 or 1928. Egg records were kept on turkey hens in 1928 and 1929. In 1928 hens were kept laying from March until October lay - ing a total of 1459 eggs or 104 eggs each. In 1928, 40 hens laid an average of 71 eggs from March 26th to August 1st, at which time they were forced into a molt A laying mash, oyster shell, and an abundance of green feed was the ration fed. $325.00 worth of turkey eggs were sold; 200 young turkeys were raised. During the holiday season just passed, $550.00 worth of market turkeys were sold and $100.00 worth remains to be sold as breeders and 28 young hens have been added to the breeding flock The birds this year averaged $3.80 each. The average selling price per pound was 29c. Total expense for 1929 was $464.00 or 12 32 per bird. . In the sale of the market birds a local market has been established by advertising. Direct selling has been brought about. Better than prevailing prices have been received by the producer and a better quality product has been enjoyed by the" consumer, for indirect selling the producer feels a responsibility for his product and must see to it that the customer is satisfied in both quality and! service. Fully one-half of the number of birds sold were dressed not in the ordinary sense of dressing, but compleiely prepared for the oven. The nice finish of the milk-fed, mash fed turkeys and a pains - taking method of dressing has brought repeated orders not only year after year but also brought as many as three orders per holiday </seg>
            <seg id="p716">REPORT OK NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE season from the same customer. Consumers are quick to recognize quality in a food product and are willing to pay a just premium for that quality. No longer is the demand for turkey confined to just the holiday season. Hostesses are serving turkey at their bridge dinners,. at club luncheons and other social affairs. Live turkeys selling at 25c per pound made possible 'the gracing of many a holiday table that had never before felt the weight of a roasted turkey. Nebraska turkeys raised in comparative confinement and fed fully on expensive, high - content protein feeds and milk mashes are distinctly different from the old time dry, stringy flesh of the range turkeys. In finding a market for these quality turkeys, the homer town should not be overlooked. Home folks appreciate and deserve our best. As many birds as possible should be sold locally, for each bird kept off the terminal markets means just one bird less in the supply that sets the price for the whole industry. The turkey does not well stand live shipment, loss of flesh ana bruising in transit make too many hazards for profitable live ship - ment. The. safest method is dressed shipment. Many producers are fearful or reluctant to dress their product. If the business expands as undoubtedly it will, the necessity of learning the different market requirements for dressed birds and packing will become imperative. The North Platte Turkey Growers Association has solved these problems, and a similar association would Inspire confidence and a sense of security among our South Platte producers. We have a specialized product, it should be so labeled and a special market found for it. Concerted action is needed for this and a cooperative such as they have in the North Platte Valley will in time be expedient. . Nebraska's turkey industry is established by its fine quality of meat which insures an ever increasing demand. Problems of the near future are as stated previously, lower pro - duction costs brought about by higher egg production, stronger fertil - ity, better hatches, quickly maturing, desirable type of market birds and at the other end of the business, efficient marketing. </seg>
            <seg id="p717">NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION WHAT IS A GOOD BREEDING FIXHJK? By ERLE SMILEY, Seward, Nebr. This can be defined as one that will show a profit on the invest - ment and that is of standard bred quality sufficient to make it a pleasure to care for this particular flock. My conception of a good breeding flock is: i First, standard quali - fications; second, vitality; third, sanitary quarters; fourth, proper feed and care. The words "standard bred poultry" are often misused. Many times flocks referred to as Standard Bred are far from it. The old saying that shape makes the breed, color the variety, is only too true In the Standard of Perfection the term shape is clearly defined and the Standard Requirements are rigid. The American fancier knows that his birds must have good shape or they will not go as show birds. In the medium and large breeds the Standard demands length, breadth, and thickness. In these breeds the fancier has In his exhibition birds all the internal capacity for feed and eggs thatJ any utility bird ever dared to have and in addition a frame and meat requirement in a chicken ready for market. Fine feathers make fine birds, we have often heard and I say that it is unjust for anybody to state or imply the standard exhibition birds are good for their feathers only. Begin - ners have been advised to let them alone, told that they will not lay and that utility is the only kind to keep. Those who make those statements are not capable of breeding and producing a bird that will both lay and stand up well in the show room. How often do we hear in the show room the remark by some outsider who says our birds are not show birds, "ours are layers." It is just an old alibi which they try to excuse themselves for not bringing their birds in to com - pare with others who do have both egg production and exhibition qualities. If you do not have standard bred flocks I would say that you. do not have good breeding flocks. Take as a comparison, who ever heard of dairymen caring for a lot of cows who did not conform to the type and color laid down by that particular breed standard. It is just as reasonable to expect that you could have a good flock of hens that did not resemble the variety they were supposed to be, either in type or color. It has been my pleasure to visit some of America's best poultry farms. The one subjeci that these breeders talk of most is their egg production and the size of eggs they are producing. While judging at a small fair this lfa.ll I found two un - usually nice pens of White Leghorns and when told where they came from I was more than pleased as the breeder !is one of Nebraska's largest producers of market eggs. Vitality is the next most essential. Without vitality you would not have standard birds. You must have prominent eyes, quality of feathers, and by quality of feather I mean rounded feathers with </seg>
            <seg id="p718">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE the webs held closely together and not the fine stringy feathers as is sometimes seen in some breeding flocks. In looking over a number of females in egg laying contests, I have never yet found a high production hen with those fine stringy feathers just mentioned. Leg shape is another thing we often find is deficient in some of the flocks. It has been said that you must have flat legs on a fowl for good egg production. The Standard of Perfection defines in Orpingtons that the legs should be round or nearly so and when an Orpington Is bred to that standard you can reasonably expect good egg production. Sanitation is one of the most neglected things in the farm flocks, but the flock keeper is gradually becoming educated to the fact that fowls must be kept clean to produce the maximum results. Much has been said on the proper care and feed, and it will be useless for me to go into this at this time. A good breeding flock should not be forced for egg production at any time during the season. If you wish to reproduce your flock or sell eggs for hatching, that hen cannot be forced and produce the results for hatching that . she should. High record hens are very seldom found that will lay a standard size egg and produce strong husky chicks. 300 eggers sound very good but in reality it is the hen that will lay from 200 to 250 that is the most valuable hen In the breeding yards. The proper mating for good breeding flocks should be given more study. Color matings are indeed a study and it can be gained only through experience. How to correct the types, the combs, etc., is another long study, and a great deal can be learned by visiting poultry exhibitions and talking to the breeders who have their birds on exhibition. Most of these breeders are only too glad to pass along this information. I noticed this fall more enthusiasm over standard bred birds than ever before. The breeders tell me that they are nearly sold out in breeding stock and it Is the hatcheries who are purchasing these birds to improve their flocks. The buying public are not satisfied any more with buying just chicks. They want chicks that when matured will look like the variety they purchased both in type and color. We all want the most profit possible from our flocks, but is it profit alone that we are looking for? Don't we want something that is a pleasure for us to care for and pleasing to the eye? The love of the beautiful comes as a heritage from nature. If the beautiful Is to die we may as well take down the ornaments from our homes, tear the priceless pictures from the art galleries of the world, and turn the rooms Into laying houses. Even the poultry papers charge extra for coloring in their advertising. They find the colors make the advertising more beautiful and attracts the customers. What we want in the present day good bred flock is beauty of the fowl, vitality, to make it possible to fill the egg basket and profit to us that it will be pleasure to feed and care for that high grade, standard bred breeding flock. </seg>

In this article several points should be emphasized in regard to parent stock. First. The breeding stock should not be selected from turkeys fed for the market. Second. The breeding stock should be isolated from the public, because a contented and quiet flock produces a higher per cent of hatchable eggs. Third. The breeding stock should be fed a balanced ration, in - cluding cod liver oil, the same as a chicken hen. ■ Artificial Hatching Believe it or not, there are more turkey eggs hatched In incuba - tors than under turkey hens. A few years ago it was stated that they could not be successfully hatched in incubators. Now, we know '.better. It takes about the same heat to. hatch turkey eggs as hen eggs. The hatching tray should be adjusted to take care of the larger eggs. We have found that they take more moisture j during the incubation period than hen eggs. Shortage of moisture usually means smaller poults. We run the temperature the first week at 101 degrees, second week at 102 degrees, third week and fourth week at 103 degrees. We turn the eggs every eight hours. It takes 28 days to hatch turkey eggs. Artificial Brooding A great many things enter into this part of raising poults. Allow the poults to remain in incubator until perfectly dry. Reducing the temperature to 95 to 98 degrees. I find the best time to remove poults to the brooder house is in the morning. j There is a difference of opinion aa to what age the poults should be put In the brooder house. Our practice is from 48 to 72 Tiours old. A few don'ts — overcrowd, overfeed, chill or overheat. At first feed lightly and regularly. Hard boiled eggs are our first feed. Follow this with a good starter feed containing cod liver oil and dry butter - milk. If available give them skim milk or sour milk to start them. Also green feed such as lettuce, alfalfa, dandelions, onion tops, etc., cut small. We use a wire screen to keep them from wandering from the heat. Watch your corners to prevent crowding and piling. By all means have a sun parlor. It will pay dividends. Roosts should be provided in the brooder house and poults taught to roost on them as early as possible. </seg>

S. BROWN, Nebraska Farmer Protective Service. ■ ■ \ Adjusting claims and furnishing information on almost every sub - ject imaginable is not the principle job of the manager of the Nebraska Farmer Protective Service. While that is important to our subscrib - ers, we are much more interested in preventing misunderstandings that make claims necessary. We are constantly, studying and analyz - ing claims that come to us, especially those having to do with differ - ences arising between the seller and buyer of stock and poultry, with the hope of devising some workable rules that are mutual and fair, which will help to check the trouble at its source. No class of .claims coming to us are more stubborn than those having to do with the little chick business. These are the claims that have a heart appeal and back of the scene there is always a woman who can, in no uncertain language, express her feelings of disgust and disappointment when a purchase' of little chicks turns out badly. In nearly every instance such claims resolve themselves into matters of dispute and to arrive at the true facts of the controversy would tax the wisdom of a Solomon and a word of warning to the hatchery and the purchaser, to always have the best possible understanding, is never out of order.; | Just recently we went over some of our files on last year's baby chick claims and found, without question, that most of these claims were due to the result of a lack of understanding by the purchaser, as to where the responsibility of the hatchery leaves off and that of the buyer begins. We have, therefore, formulated a set of rules which, in our opinion, should fairly cover the service that the hatchery usually does and should render, and the buyer should assume, which is about as follows: First, the dealer should use eggs for hatching that come only from flocks which he knows to be of standard breeds, free from disease and crosses. Second, the dealer should not ship chicks other than those hatched in his own incubator, unless he notifies the buyer and gets his assent thereto. Third, the dealer having lawful interest or ownership in hatcheries located at points other than his regularly advertised business address, should' state this fact and the location of such hatchery, in his ad - vertising. </seg>
            <seg id="p721">NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION Fourth, the dealer's duty in case of failure of expected hatches, where he is unable to fill orders as agreed and scheduled, is to im - mediately notify the buyer, in writing, at the Isame time offering him a refund -in case the buyer does not wish his order filled from the next succeeding hatch, and the date of such hatch should be clearly stated. If unable to fill the order from this] hatch, then he should refund the buyer his money, in full, within 24 hours thereafter. -' ■ ■ Buyer's Responsibility Where the dealer performs his part of the contract, as advertised and agreed to, it is then that the buyers responsibility begins. He must understand there is risk he must assume just as in the case of anything else. He must remember that baby chicks are very deli - cate and require proper care, proper housing! and proper feeding, if they are to live and mature into healthy birds. He should also bear in mind, that a large percentage of supposed cases of bacillary white diarrhea is just plain bowel trouble, caused from chilling, overheating or improper feeding. The dealer cannot well jbe held responsible for anything that happens to the chicks after being expressed or put in the malls for delivery, except that most of them guarantee live de - livery and to replace, without further charge, those which are missing or dead. Occasionally a dealer assumes, by previous agreement, greater responsibility than this, but In that case they usually get a higher price to cover . losses. The above are all matters that should be carefully understood be - tween buyer and seller before the order Is given. If such understand - ing Is definite, no disappointment need result.! It should be clearly understood by the buyer that the hatchery does not guarantee chicks to live, unless the hatchery makes this statement in a special guarantee. Some losses are caused by neglect on the part of the transportation company. I In the case of parcel post shipments the Postofflce Department does not permit Inspection before acceptance and will assume no responsibility unless the parcel is insured. In the case of parcel post shipments which arrive in bad condition the buyer should get some responsible person to examine them at once and make a statement to the hatchery immediately. Express shipments can be examined before they are accepted. The 1-uyer should have the agent note the number of dead and crippled chicks, on the receipt, to give a basis for a claim against the hatchery. The buyer should anticipate his order and get everything in con - dition that proper care may be given the little chicks when they arrive. If you do not have a good brooder house, get busy now while you have a little spare time and fix the old one over. Be sure your brooder is in good condition. Feed only such feed as you know to be reliable, from past experience, or that is recommended to you by </seg>

A baby chick is the most delicate little thing on the farm, re - quiring the most tender care, and too great precaution cannot be taken to see that the chicks are provided wiih the very best of housing and in no way exposed to draft or changing weather conditions.' . — THE COST OF PRODUCING BKOIL.EKS By HENRY F. WALZ, Battle Creek, Nebr. If broilers can be produced economically in Nebraska on a quantity basis, we have in this side line a welcome addition to our poultry activities. Broiler production would bring new opportunity to the hatchery, as well as the producer of hatching- eggs. It would extend the hatching season several weeks since chicks hatched particularly for the broiler trade would be needed earlier than those for replacing the farm flocks. The hatching equipment could be used over a longer period and producers of hatching eggs would have an earlier market at the premium paid for eggs for Incubation purposes. The diversion of a larger part of January and February eggs from regular market channels should also tend to hold up the price of eggs in general in the period preceding the regular hatching season and the demand for storage eggs. The use of brooding equipment over a longer period would reduce the overhead expense involved in taxes, interest and depreciation. In fact, the use of equipment earlier would not materially increase the yearly overhead on these Items. A new source of profit would induce the installation of better brooding equipment and thereby react favorably, in the later seasons production of pullets. While proper marketing of a quality product will be an important factor, economical production will largely determine the success of a broiler venture. We must produce at a minimum cost in -order to compete with those more favorably situated as to market. There should be no doubt that we can produce broilers more economically now than we could a few years ago. Rapid strides have been made in incubation and brooding. Better equipment is now available! and a better knowledge of brooding makes possible more rapid growth and lower mortality. A better knowledge of hatching is also reducing mortality. The introduction of battery brooders seems to have opened a new field to the poultry raiser. The battery makes possible the handling of large numbers of chicks with a minimum of floor space and labor as well as fuel cost. With a good system one man can take care of ten thousand chicks up to ten weeks old with, a comparatively small fuel cost and building space. Chicks grow . . ■ • .• </seg>
            <seg id="p723">NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION mo P i l 8 d tu y re dUe * """" SanUary conditl °™ and more uniform heat and As the production of broilers heretofore has been principally a necessary side line In the raising of pullets to replace the farm flocks not much has been done in the way of cost accounting. Several estimates I have been able to flild vary greatly, partic - ularly in the cost of day-old chicks and feed.! The cost of producing broilers may be listed under the following items: Cost of day-old chicks; mortality; feed; fuel; litter, labor and takes; depreciation on equipment and iniierest. I think we can Bafely place the cost of da|y-old chicks for broiler purposes at ten cents each. These chicks need not come from standard bred or high production flocks. They need not be pure bred. Good vitality and a large breed would be necessary. Mortality will irreatlv determine cost if it is high. With good modern equipment good ration and management, one ought to be able to raise 85 per cent of the chicks to ten weeks old so we will have added to the cost of the chick 1% cents for mortality. A chick up 1 to ten weeks old will consume approximately five pounds of feed. On the cost of feed we find estimates vary greatly. Some place the cost as high as five cents per pound. Here in Nebraska where we have a ready supply of grain at reasonable prices we can cut that cost to 21% cents per pound so we will have a feed cost of 12% cents to produce a ten weeks old chick. The cost of fuel, litter, labor and takes will vary with the weather, size and kind of brooders used, and the number of months each year the equipment is In operation. I have placed this cost at 5 cents per chick although I think it could {be reduced somewhat where brooding is done on an extensive scale with labor saving equip - ment. Depreciation and interest on investment I have placed at 3 cents .per chick. If these estimates stand we have a ten weeks old chick at a cost of 32 cents and he should weigh two pounds My conclusion is that we can produce broilers profitably when the price is 20 cents per pound clear of shipping expense. However these estimates will not hold on summer hatched chicks because it' is not possible to get the growth In the same time and on the same amount of feed. I doubt if summer hatched chicks will make a profit under most favorable conditions. Nebraska is in a position to compete favorably with other states n the production of broilers. Situated as we ire in a grain produc - ing area we can secure feed at a minimum cost. I anticipate that broiler raising will shortly develop to a considerable industry in Nebraska. . I </seg>
