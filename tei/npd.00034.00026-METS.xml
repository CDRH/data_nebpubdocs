            <seg id="p006">5 PART I. JUDGING HORSES AND CATTLE BY H. J. GRAMLICH A Trio of Good Shorthorns. Animal Husbandry is the study of live stock. As it is commonly taught it includes the feeding, care and judging of our common farm animals, namely horses, cattle, sheep and hogs. In practical experience a person will first learn to feed and care for stock and later will become a judge. However, in studying Animal Husbandry it seems best to first take up the judging and after becoming familiar with the types and breeds one can then study the principles of </seg>
            <seg id="p007">6 I To become a good judge of stock should be the desire of every and this accomplishment is within the grasp of all who are ng to work. It is not easy to size up an animal and be able to its faults and good points in such a manner as to prove to rs that you are right in your judgment. However, with train - and experience you can become very quick at this and this vledge has a practical value which you will find of constant use. A Team of Percheron Mares. No matter how much training a boy has he cannot hope to become a good judge unless he develops the power of observation. By that is meant noticing each animal, and determining its weak and strong points. This is especially true of horses. One can gen - erally see a good many horses in the course of a season as he ex - changes help with neighbors, goes to town, and at numerous other times when he has occasion to be where there are teams working. Boys who go to a town school have a splendid chance to see many horses. By noticing these horses the eye soon begins to observe unusual points, and after establishing this habit of observing, the progress will be quite rapid. To begin with, one might merely </seg>
            <seg id="p008">Judging Horses and Cattle. 7 note the color, or he might note whether the horse has sufficient bone in his legs, whether he is well proportioned, make an estimate on his height at withers, or any other of the numerous points taken into account in judging horses. As the score card is used for further class work there will be more points discussed and consequently the student will notice more things about each animal as he looks it over. This method will apply in judging any class of stock. The Score Card. tWhat is the score card and of what use is it? This is a very 'itant question because it is used with beginners in stock - ing and it serves a purpose which nothing else could. It is a upon which each portion of the animal's body is named, a de - tion of perfect in each case following the name. Opposite each is a number. This indicates the importance of one part of the compared with another. A total of these numbers gives ioo, perfect score. The principal reason the score card is used with beginners in stock- judging is the fact that it will teach them to observe each part of the animal separately. As an illustration, the boy who looks at a horse casually notices the color, size or some other general point. Perhaps there are two horses. The prettier colored horse will probably win the boy's eye and he will say it is the best. The boy who has scored horses and learned the importance of each part knows that color is of but little real value to the horse and that the best horse is the one which excels in bone, feet, chest and points which really make him a better horse for work and use. The person who has become a good horse judge by experience will generally pick out the best horse, but after he has done so it is often impos - sible for him to tell why. The person who has studied and used the score card has the advantage of being able to point out the good and bad points of each horse, and hence can tell why he makes his selec - tion. In judging horses at Fairs the score card is not used, because it would take up too much time, and likewise in purchasing horses it would be impracticable. IOn the next page is a score card for draft horses. A farm horse &gt;e scored after you have studied the card. The accompanying ration shows each point on the body. This will prove useful in •mining the points on the real horse. </seg>

The of these is the draft, for which the score card has been given. &gt;es of this type are built for power. They are comparatively to the ground, deep-bodied and heavily muscled. The market inds weight in draft horses, and consequently the heavier the r.

            <seg id="p011">10 the large cities. The prices paid for draft horses warrant their production upon the average farm in preference to smaller horses of the other types. The breeds of draft horses are the Percheron from France, the Belgian from Belgium, the English Shire from England, and the Clydesdale from Scotland. Horses representing each of these breeds are more or less numerous in Nebraska. A Hackney Showing Good Coach Type. Prize-winning English Hackney. A good specimen of the Coach type. Note the short strong back, the level croup, the sloping shoulder and pastern and the general evidence of style and quality throughout. t Coach Type. — Horses of this type are not very common. They medium sized, generally weighing 1,200 to 1,400 pounds. They ; been bred for style and action and their value depends largely n the manner in which they can trot, it being very essential that • pick their feet up high and thus attract attention as they move, y are demanded largely by the rich of the cities. The breeds :h come under this type are the German Coach, the French ch, and the English Hackney, each from the country repre - ed in the name. </seg>

Winner of sweepstakes at the Iowa State Fair in harness horse classes. Note the abundance of quality, n especially in the limbs. The sloping shoulder gives a long and free ;. Quality, speed and conformation are the three principal requirements is type. Light or Road Type. — Specimens of this type are built for speed. The American trotter, or Standard-bred trotter as it is called, is the most common breed of road horses in America. They are rather leggy, the muscles of the body and limbs are long and slender, indicating speed rather than power. In weight there is a variation of from 900 to 1,200 pounds. Automobiles have hurt the sale of these horses and prices are rather low compared with draft horse prices, unless the individual happens to be an exceptionally good one. </seg>
            <seg id="p013">12 Judging Horses and Cattle. The Draft Breeds. A Good Type of Percheron. Percheron or Norman. — Black and grey are the common colors of Percheron horses. The shade of grey may be steel, iron or dapple. There are a few bay and sorrel Percherons, but they are rarely seen in America. The hoofs are generally dark and the legs are free from the bushy hair which is found on the Shire and Clydesdale. The bone is comparatively light for the size of the horse. The head generally expresses intelligence, being quite wide and full across the forehead. These horses come from the district of La Perche in France. About three thousand of them are im - ported to the United States each year. Imported horses always have the letters P. S. stamped on the near side of the neck about ten inches behind the throatlatch. Their tails are nearly always docked before they leave France. Most stallions are broken to work in La Perche when 18 months old, hence the white patches of hair on the shoulders and backs of many imported horses. La Perche is 60 </seg>
            <seg id="p014">13 Cherry County, Nebraska. The picture on the cover is a scene in La Perche showing a dappled grey mare and colt in pacture. A Shire in Action tHE Shire. — This is the largest of the draft breeds. Shire can generally be told by the long, coarse hair below the knees &gt;cks. In color we find mostly bays and browns, with more or [lite in the face and upon the legs. However, there are quite a ilacks, dappled greys, sorrels and roans. White markings lpon most of these, too. Shires are short backed with a fairly ody and as a general rule a very heavy bone in the legs. They been bred for heavy draft work for centuries in England, is a tendency for Shires to be quite Roman in the nose. They t as good in disposition as some of the other breeds. The feet nerally rather flat and spreading and the hoofs have a tendency brittle. The eye is the strongest of any of our draft breeds generally large and of hazel color. The principal objection ti in America is the lone hair, or feather as it is called, which </seg>
            <seg id="p015">14 we find upon the legs. It is really a protection, although when allowed to become very dirty, skin diseases will occur beneath it. The Clydesdale. — This breed originated in Scotland. In many respects it resembles the Shire. Clydes are smaller and have less depth with more length of body than the Shires. The feather upon </seg>
            <seg id="p016">15 the legs is also much finer and generally is just found along the back edge of the legs, while in Shires it is generally coarse, curly and protrudes from all sides of the leg. Various shades of bay are the prevailing colors with some browns, blacks, sorrels and red roans be - sides. White limbs are more common than in the Shires, and blazed faces are also numerous. The leg below the knee is flat and the pastern is long, giving the horse a free easy action. Some Clydes are so long bodied as to sway in the back, although this is not gen - erally the case. There are not many Clydes in Nebraska, but they bring good prices when sold for city use. §The Belgian. — Like the Percheron, this breed is free from hair on the legs. As a rule Belgians are short bodied, very in the girth and carry great width, making them good feeders, neck is generally short and the head rather large and coarse. A Light-maned Sorrel Imported Belgian. </seg>
            <seg id="p017">16 Judging Horses and Cattle. The common color is some shade of sorrel or chestnut, although there are many red-roans, blue-roans, bays and browns, with a few blacks and greys. The feet are sometimes small and upright, bul generally of splendid substance, so that they wear well. The crouii is often quite steep. White markings in the face and on the limbs arc much less profuse than on the Shire and Clyde. In disposition these horses are rather quiet and gentle, due partially to the handling they receive in their native land. The leg below the knee is roundish and the bone is not overly heavy. EXERCISE I. (Read over the description given for each of the draft breeds, then endeavor to determine which breed each of your large i horses resembles the most closely. Most of the horses weigh - [,300 pounds or over will show some resemblance to some one le above breeds. By inquiry you can doubtless find out the iing, but make your observations first. If pure-breds can be med and taken to the school they will form a fine study of exercise 2. Search through the farm and live stock papers at home and procure good photographs of horses representing each breed named above. Paste these in your notebook and write a short description below each. EXERCISE 3. Notice the horses which you have at home, and also those you see on your way to school or in town, and see how many of the fol - lowing colors you can identify : Dappled grey, steel grey, iron grey, black, brown, seal brown, dark bay, light bay, sorrel, chestnut, straw - berry or red roan, blue roan, black with grey hairs. exercise 4. (Generally speaking, Roman nosed horses are somewhat stub - . They are good workers, standing lots of hard usage and ling it but little. Their mouths are generally hard and this fact, her with their naturally headstrong disposition, makes them to control. As evidence of this look at your horses at home and </seg>
            <seg id="p018">17 thow many of the Roman-nosed ones are driven with wire or r severe bits. You perhaps know the disposition of those that have worked yourself. If you can get to town some day when e are lots of teams, count the total number of horses tied along block. Notice the number which you would call Roman-nosed, how many of them have bits other than the common broken bit. :e a report of this to your teacher, or to the Club. exercise 5. t Suppose one of your horses has been stolen and you wish to rtise for him in the newspapers. Write a complete description at a stranger could identify him at sight. Include the following «: 1(1) Weight; (2) height in hands at withers (1 hand equals 4 :s ) ; (3) color; (4) describe location of white markings, as strip or blaze in face, near hind ankle white, etc. ; (5) locate any ishes, such as wire cuts or other injuries, and give description; mention harness or saddle marks if there are any, generally ! hairs have grown out where the injury was, and these are marks of identity; (7) any peculiarities which you know the : to have might also be mentioned. (Use your own pony for if you wish. If this work is done at school, or Club meeting, ight describe the same horse or pony.) exercise 6. tDraw a picture of a horse and mark same off into the parts m on page 9. Then number each part and write description at. After doing this once or twice with your book before you, : the book and make the divisions from memory. With a little tice you will be able to do this quite accurately. This will help greatly in becoming familiar with the parts of the horse's body. exercise 7. The low-down, deep-bodied horse is generally an easy keeper. As a rule he is in good flesh the year round regardless of how hard he is worked. The up-standing, leggy horse is inclined to be shallow bodied and a hard keeper, many of them being difficult to fatten, </seg>
            <seg id="p019">18 iin the winter when they are not working. See how many illus - sns of the above you can find, and keep a record of same. A point to keep in mind is that a well proportioned horse lures about the same from the ground up to the underline as i the underline up to the withers. (This measurement should be : a short distance to the rear of either fore leg.) Measure a and see if you can find one which is about right in that respect, measure several leggy horses and several low-set ones to see rontrast. exercise 8. KSome people insist that the horse is not an intelligent animal cannot think. Write an essay about some real smart horse h you have owned or at least known and tell about the different r ,s which it has done to prove that it has intelligence. EXERCISE 9. I Normally the upper and lower incisors in a horse's mouth meet ly when the mouth closes. In some horses the upper incisors iut over those in the lower jaw when the mouth is closed. Such ndition is commonly called a parrot-mouth. Occasionally the ■r teeth are set back and when the jaws are together we find the r teeth projecting out beyond them. This is termed a bull-dog th and it resembles very much the set of teeth common to the dog. Spread the lips of your horses at home and see how f parrot-mouthed horses you have, also if there are any of the r kind. You will find the former condition quite frequently, :ially among older horses. Telling a Horse's Age. (Besides the desire to become a good horse judge, every boy Id know how to tell a horse's age. This is an accomplishment h will require years of practice and experience, although there 1 few general rules which will aid you. Men who have handled f horses will generally be able to tell a horse's age pretty accu - y, although they will often make mistakes, especially with horses h are past ten or twelve years in age. As a first rule to keep in mind it might be well to re-state the point made at the beginning, that "observation is necessary for sue- </seg>
            <seg id="p020">Judging Horses and Cattle. 19 cess." In other words, you cannot hope to become competent at estimating the age of horses unless you observe a great many of them, and after examining the mouths, ask the owners how old these horses are. Of course, you should always make an estimate as to the age before inquiring, as this will cause you to look more carefully and notice all details. (The teeth are the most reliable indication of a horse's age. •e are numerous other methods in use, but they are not as ite as the teeth. The appearance of a horse will generally give r idea as to whether he is a colt, a well-developed horse, or an torse, the head being as good an index as any part of the body, rule the cavity above the eye does not become very noticeable the animal is pretty well along in years. The appearance of hairs on the forehead and face indicates age generally, although ! horses of dark color develop these while still quite young. The incisors, or the teeth at the front of the mouth, are the ones which give us the most reliable information and are most easily observed. Examine the mouth of a horse five years old or over. How many incisor teeth do you find in each jaw ? I In examining a horse's mouth first push the lips back and notice teeth while together. Some horses which are very gentle will nit you to examine the mouth as much as you wish without ping the tongue ; however, with many it is necessary to secure tongue in one hand and draw it down over the teeth in order to e them to keep the mouth open. (No horse will bite his own ;ue.) If you have never tried to do this, it will be better for you sk your father or some other man to help you until you learn • The teeth appear about as follows in the mouth of the colt : Milk Teeth. t First, the center pair. These will be found in the colt's mouth irth, or at least they appear within a few days after birth. ;e in the upper jaw generally come at about the same time as : in the lower jaw. (This holds quite true, not only with milk , but with permanent teeth as well.) </seg>
            <seg id="p021">20 Second, the intermediate incisors will appear when the colt is from six to nine weeks old. Third, the corner incisors generally cut through at seven to nine months of age. Permanent Teeth. ■ First, the center pair appear when the colt is approximately and a half years old. Second, the intermediate pair at three and a half years. Third, the corner pair at four and a half years. The above rule can be easily learned and in a general way you will find it good. However, you should be prepared to find excep - tions, especially with the appearance of the permanent teeth. Often a colt will be nearly three years old before the center incisors ap]R'ar. Colts which are born in the spring generally shed each pair of milk teeth between the months of September and February each year as they are coming three, four and five years of age. As an example of an exception to the above rule, the writer recently saw a horse which was five years old and had just shed the center pair of in - cisors. Consequently do not consider the rule as exact, but learn it and then watch^the mouths of your colts and young horses at home and see how well the rule holds with them. 1 After the horse has become full-mouthed, which is as he is ris - five years old, it becomes more difficult to tell the age and it ires a great deal of observation to become accurate. ■ In a general way the following rules may be relied upon to tell horse's age from five until eight years. Iln the spring when he is five the corner teeth are just coming lto full wear and the dark cavity or cup is evident in all six of each jaw. BAt six years of age the cups in the center incisors below have ppeared and the surface of the tooth is nearly level. A hook also developed on the back corner of each upper corner incisor, is hook may not appear until seven in some cases.) At seven years the cups have left the middle pair of teeth and at eight years they have left the corner pair. </seg>
            <seg id="p022">Judging Horses and Cattle. 21 Pe are really rather flexible rules and exceptions to found quite common. This is especially- true in the i of the state, where the teeth wear off much quicker ind consequently the cups disappear before the time lie. After eight years of age there are numerous changes in the teeth, but most of these would require considerable explanation and it would be better for the boy to try to learn the points for telling a young horse's age before bothering with those rules which apply to the teeth of old horses. A horse is "smooth-mouthed" when the cups have all disap - l&gt;eared in the lower jaw, consequently at about eight years of age. CATTLE. K Cattle are classified into three groups, according to the uses to h they are adapted. These groups or types are the beef, dual - ose, and dairy. Cattle Showing Beef Type. Note width, depth and squareness of bodies. </seg>
            <seg id="p023">22 ously distributed over the back, ribs, and hindquarters from which the higher-priced cuts come. Cows of beef type are generally poor milkers. The Hereford, Angus, Galloway and most Shorthorns are of this type. Flora, an Ayrshire in the University Dairy Herd. Some specimens of this breed are classed as dual purpose. This cow's butter record is 470 lbs. in one year. Dual Purpose. — The dual-purpose cow is one which produces considerable milk and which when slaughtered furnishes a pretty good beef carcass. Some Shorthorns are of this type being rather too leggy and narrow bodied to be classed as beef type and not good enough milkers to rank as dairy type. The Red Polls are the chief breed of dual purpose cattle. They are dark red and always polled (that is. without horns), although in type there is considerable vari - ation. Calves from cows of dual type make fair gains when placed in the feed-lot and upon the market they bring prices ranging some - what below those paid for beef steers. Many cows which are kept upon Nebraska farms are somewhat of the dual type, although some are unworthy of being classed in any type other than scrub. </seg>
            <seg id="p024">23 Ona B, a Fair Type of Jersey, Owned by the Univer - sity. Butter record 3U8 lbs. in one year. I Dairy. — Dairy type is that type which has been bred and de - ped to produce milk regardless of beef. A good dairy cow is :rally the opposite of a good beef cow. The body is lean, the e protrudes along the back, the hindquarters are very light and general form of the animal is indicative of capacity to handle of feed and transform it into milk. When dairy animals are to the butcher rather low prices are received, because they s a large percentage of waste and the carcass is mostly bone and 1 muscle, whereas a good beef carcass carries a large percentage ender, juicy meat. »The breeds of dairy cattle common in Nebraska are the Hol - 1 and the Jersey. There are a few Guernseys and Ayrshires in eastern part of the state. </seg>

            <seg id="p026">25 I Judging Milk Cows. It is quite easy to secure cows which are accustomed to being handled and use them to judge at the school or club. Milch cows and horses are the easiest animals to secure for this work and the most satisfactory. A Class in the School of Agriculture judging Holstein cows. The record cows Katy Gerben on the left and Roxanna on the right. These are all four very typical specimens of the breed. There are many indications of a cow's capacity for producing milk. Inasmuch as milk production is the chief duty of Nebraska cows, especially those kept upon the smaller farms, it seems well to make a study of the points which indicate capacity at the milk pail. Formerly cows were kept for the calves which they raised, but the price of land has risen so high now that one can no longer afford to keep cows for the calves, but must count upon revenue from the milk and butter produced if a reasonable return from the land and feed is to be secured. There is a vast difference in the milk producing power of differ - ent cows. Two cows may be about the same size and eat practically </seg>
            <seg id="p027">26 I same amount of feed in a year, yet if records are kept one of e cows may produce twice or three times as much milk and er as the other. An instance of this was shown last season in the y herd at the University Farm. The Holstein cow Roxanna produced 21,572 pounds of milk, which contained 756 pounds of butter fat, or the equivalent of 882 pounds of butter. The Holstein cow Ino produced 7,290 pounds of milk, containing 240 pounds of butterfat, or 280 pounds of butter. These two cows are about the same size. Roxanna ate more feed than Ino, but not nearly so much in proportion to the milk and butter she produced. In other words Roxanna produced butter a great deal cheaper per pound than did Ino. Cherry, a Guernsey cow owned at the University Farm. Note the refined head and neck, as well as the splendid body. Many Guernseys droop in the back as does this cow. Cherry's butter record is 533 lbs. in one year. iOne needs but to look at these two cows to find the cause for vast difference. Ino is a rather shallow-bodied cow. Her spine w between the shoulder blades and she has a rather beefy ap - ance, being meaty across the withers. Her hindquarters are and beefy. Her udder is small and in looking at her you soon her up as being a cow not adapted to handling large quantities </seg>
            <seg id="p028">27 of feed. Her eye is dull and disposition quiet, much like that of a beef steer. She puts flesh on her body rather than turning all energy into the milk-pail. Roxanna is a typical dairy type. The body is deep and long, the spine stands up well between the shoulder blades, with no thick, beefy shoulders, the udder is large and roomy and the skin is soft and elastic. As you look at her general appearance she impresses you as being adapted to consuming lots of feed and turning it into milk. Her chest is deep and gives her ample room for the heart and lungs, the vital organs which propel the body. Roxanna, a Holstein cow owned at the University Farm. The above cut shows what is considered an ideal dairy type Notice the following points : </seg>

I Each year in America the population is much larger than that ie year before, and this population must be fed. Increased de - d for foodstuffs never fails to drive the price of land upward, nany cases land values in Nebraska have more than doubled in years. There is very little new land in the United States to ipy. Land already under the plow must produce more as the s go by. It is also true that each year sees a decrease in the fertility of our soil. Large yields become yearly more difficult to produce. Farmers are today farming more acres than ever before, but ex - cepting in speed, there is little essential improvement in farming. A large yield per acre is one of the best measures of profitable produc - tion. It is a fact that most Nebraska farms are not producing with profit. In an investigation of many farms in Lancaster County, for instance, only ten per cent were found to be returning a fair rate of interest. Better Methods Needed. I Because of these things, it is evident that the farming of the will not continue to do for the future. Farming must become &gt; intensive. Soil fertility must be increased and maintained, fanner of today seldom stops to consider that his farming, suc - :ul as it has been in its day, is that of an age which is passing, son must learn a new fanning. Many fathers feel that they have done well if they can leave a farm to each son. A boy may inherit a forty, or even a section, and still be poor, indeed.

It is to this father and his son that a little plan is suggested which, it is hoped, will prove of permanent interest and profit to both. The Plan. KThe little plan here offered is only a suggestion in line with the joing ideas. Essentially the plan consists in this: KLet the father allow the boy to have for a year a little piece of nd on which he is to raise corn for maximum yields and accord - o his own ideas. The "boy field" need not be large. It is sug - :d that in most cases an acre should do, especially the first year. I The exact arrangements by which the son gets his land is itter which the boy and his father can best decide for them - :s. In general we believe it is best for the boy to have the e management of his land, but that he should consult with the :r about all the details of the work. The father can save the i lot of mistakes. In this connection three plans are suggested : Ki. The boy may have full responsibility for the acre and have lis share of the proceeds only what the yield of his acre is over of adjoining land in his father's field. This plan is particularly nmended. 2. The boy may have full responsibility for the acre and pay his father the rent customary in the neighborhood. 3. Father and son agree in advance on plans and methods and then together carry their plan out. I As to arrangements after the first year, this will probably be ■mined in part at least by the manner in which the first year's has worked. It would seem no more than fair that should the 1 field yield no better than that of his father, the plan should not be dropped. A second, third, or even a fourth trial would 1 wise as long as the boy is interested and will try hard to excel ather. Laying Out the Acre. §To be fair to both boy and father, the boy's field should be as ly like the general field of his father's as it is possible to obtain, e there is often considerable damage from grasshoppers, or </seg>
            <seg id="p032">31 Iibly other enemies, at the very edge of the field, and because the rod or two usually does not yield well, the boy should be given icre at a safe distance from the edge. This is particularly im - ant along the south edge of a field, where hot, dry winds do • worst. The following table may help in measuring off the One acre= i rod x 160 rods One acre= 2 rods x 80 rods One acre= 4 rods x 40 rods One acre= 8 rods x 20 rods One acre= 16 rods x 10 rods Methods of Increasing Yield. There are three general methods of increasing yields of crops : 1. Good Seed. 2. Good Soil. 3. Good Care. 1. Good Seed. — Use some good variety which has been grown for a number of years in the neighborhood. Possibly the corn grown by the father will give the best results. In selecting the ear, the main thing to keep in mind is that the large ear with very deep, rough, rather starchy kernels, is not apt to mature well and is likely to have low germinating power. Furthermore, contrary to the gen - eral impression, corn of this type has not yielded better under Ne - braska conditions than have more slender ears with kernels of medium depth and roughness. To get corn that will grow is the most important single consideration. One should see to it that every ear planted will grow. To make sure that no dead ears are planted a germination test should be made. The following description and illustrations of a germinator and a germination test may be of value : Testing Seed Corn. tAny old or rough lumber may be used. The box should be t four inches deep. Each ear requires a space of about two and ialf inches square. For this reason a box which will test 100 should be about thirty inches square. This will allow a vacant ; around the edge of the box. IThe bottom of the germinator should not be made too tight, foi eing wet up it will swell and warp. A better plan is to leave cs about one-fourth of an inch wide between the boards to allow </seg>
            <seg id="p033">32 ■ expansion. Cover these cracks on the inside with thin strips nail lightly along one edge only, or cover with a cloth. KThe best medium for holding the water is sawdust. If this ot be secured, sand or soil will answer. About two inches of sawdust should be put into the germinator, smoothed and ed. I Prepare as follows a sheet of white cloth about thirty inches re to be laid upon the sawdust ; mark upon this cloth one hun - spaces two and one-half inches square (ten squares each way), leaves a margin of about two and one-half inches unused on dges. The squares are numbered consecutively, beginning at upper left hand corner and numbering across to the right, ire 1 1 falls directly under square i and square 20 under square Wet the cloth and spread smoothly over the sawdust. The mipanying cut illustrates the germinator after it is filled. Rack and Germinator. Before kernels are placed upon the squares there must be some </seg>
            <seg id="p034">33 First, a rack may be made of i x 4 boards nailed together and form - ing a square twenty-five inches across. Wires are stretched across this both ways at intervals of two and one-half inches and firmly secured. The above cut shows such a rack filled with ears. Second a still simpler way is to cut paper into three-fourths inch squares These squares are numbered from 1 to 100 and secured to the butts of the ears by means of pins, tacks or small nails. This is especially advisable where many people handle the ears. Third, the ears may be laid in order on shelves as shown in following picture. Filling the Germinator. FILLING THE GERMINATOR. Six kernels should be taken from each ear, two near the butt, on opposite sides of the ear, two from the middle and two from near the tip. Remove the kernels with a knife blade by prying at their edges, — next on the flat side. Pulled thus no germs will be injured. </seg>
            <seg id="p035">34 Place the six kernels on the proper square with the germ side up. The next step is to cover the loaded squares with a second cloth for protection. Muslin of firm weave is best for this purpose. This cloth should be about thirty inches square. Wet the cloth and lay it smoothly over the kernels. Take a large cloth, almost anything will do, and lay it over the germinator and cover with an inch of wet sawdust. Fold the edges over the sawdust. If the cloth is not too small it will completely cover the top of the sawdust, making a sort of pad or mattress. tThe germinator should be kept in a warm place in which the ierature does not vary greatly. Many living rooms and some lens furnish such conditions. From seventy to eighty degrees st. Under favorable conditions of temperature a test should be &gt;lete in a week or less. Sometimes it is necessary to sprinkle r over the pad to maintain sufficient moisture. READING THE TEST. In preparing to inspect the test it is best to carefully roll first READING THE TEST STROI \ DEAD STRONG WE, WEAK DEAD </seg>
            <seg id="p036">35 the pad and then the shield cloth to one side, instead of merely pull - ing them off. If kernels adhere to the shield cloth as it is rolled off, brush them back into their proper squares. Ordinarily no ear should be saved for seed unless all six of its kernels germinate perfectly Study the picture "Reading the Test." Every kernel should have a good strong sprout from each end of the germ. The end at the tip of the kernel furnishes the root sprout, while the other end furnishes the stem sprout. 12. Good Soil. — Improvement in soil fertility more than any • one thing makes possible greatly increased crop yields. About nly way the soil can be improved for the present season's crop means of manuring. There is little Nebraska soil that is too for corn. There is little but what manure will in the long run ledly benefit. For immediate effects, the application of manure Id be light. In case of a dry year even a light manuring may :e rather than increase the yield. Four to six loads of manure icre are recommended. The following points should be observed in applying manure: The manure should be as fine and well rotted as possible. It should be evenly distributed, preferably with a manure spreader. It should be applied as early as possible in the spring. As soon as possible after the ground has thawed out in the spring the soil should be given a thorough double disking. Disking lessens the liability of loss of manure and water during heavy rains from surface run-off. Moreover, manure disked thoroughly and well incorporated with the soil, cannot, on being turned over by the plow, make a layer of coarse material at the bottom of the furrow, which breaks off the capillary connection between furrow slice and subsoil. Where manure is applied, it should be followed by double disking, whether the ground is to be listed or plowed and surface planted. 13. Good Care. — Unless there is reason to fear blowing of the the earlier the soil is plowed the better. In close, heavy soil is moist, rather deep plowing (6 inches to 8 inches) is wise so as one does it early and gets little deeper than previous plow - have gone. In light, porous soils, and especially if it is rather plowing to a medium depth is recommended. Each half-day's </seg>
            <seg id="p037">36 (ng should be harrowed twice before leaving the field. If left the next day much moisture may escape, and it is much harder ?ak up the clods. Unless the soil is of a very close, heavy type, rmer it is compacted the better. This can be done by using the &gt;\v or the disk often. Keep down weeds by harrowing, or even disking, as may be necessary. Listing is often spoken of as a lazy man's method of fanning. It is true that most careless farmers seem to prefer it. It is also true that land can be grown to corn more cheaply by this method. Rightly conducted, listing may give better results than any other method. This is particularly true in the deep, open soil and the dry, windy climate of west Nebraska. All soils, however, should be thor - oughly plowed occasionally. In low, heavy, cold soils, or on very rolling ground, where washing is apt to occur, listing seems inferior t&lt; i surface planting. This is especially true in east Nebraska. On this point the latest practice of the most careful farmers in the neighborhood is the best guide. Time of Planting. I Plant at the time which experience on your ground has proven Little is gained, and often much is lost, by planting cold, wet, bottom land early. Ordinarily, planting should be delayed until jround is warm. From May 8th to 20th is probably the best for state as a whole. Rate of Planting I The proper rate of planting for any field is usually best deter - :d by experience. With corn of strong germinating power it is am wise to plant less than two and never more than four kernels hill, or at a proportionate rate for drilled or listed corn. Three ids per hill, or at that rate in listing or drilling, seems the best age rate for east Nebraska as a whole. The more fertile and &gt;t the ground the more thickly it may be planted. Cultivation. On surface planted corn, both before the corn is up and for a Listing vs. Sirfack Planting. </seg>
            <seg id="p038">37 to advantage. Lister ditches should not be filled too much till at least the second time over. A deep-root system for corn is very de - sirable under Nebraska conditions. Any deep cultivation of soil that is given should ordinarily be given not later than the second time over. The third and fourth cultivation should be rather shallow. Deep cultivation at this time harms the numerous, shallow roots of the corn plant very much. This is especially true in surface planted corn. One can seldom stir more than three inches deep without considerable harm to the roots. Occasionally, rather deep cultiva - tion the first and second time over is justified. In spite of some damage to roots, such stirring may be advisable for cold, wet, gumbo soils, in soil greatly lacking in humus, in ground badly run together by heavy rains, or if weeds for any reason become big and well established. I The ground should be kept level. Rows should not be ridged, eneral, cultivators with six to eight shovels, or those with hori - al blades which cut two or three inches below the surface, do t&gt;est work. The type of cultivator will depend upon the kind of and the amount of tresh present. Very trashy ground is hard to k with cultivators of the above types. Experience suggests that should not be cultivated less than three times, even in west Ne - ka. Experiments indicate that cultivation more than five times jm pays. In most years there is probably little to be gained by cultivation after the corn is "laid by." Under certain conditions in other years, the practice is probably advisable. For instance, if a heavy rain comes after the corn is laid by, the surface of the ground is run to - gether, and often "bakes," so that air is kept out and the formation of plant food in the soil is retarded. This crust allows some of the soil water to be lost through evaporation. Further rainfall on such soil is apt to be lost to a considerable extent from surface run-off. This is especially true if the field is sloping. Lastly, weeds under these conditions are apt to start vigorously. These weeds use the same water and plant food needed by the corn. Late cultivation between the rows under the above conditions is undoubtedly of great </seg>
            <seg id="p039">38 as the ground is dry enough to work. In case of lo'ng-continued drought, with the soil still loose from previous cultivation, one need expect little gain from further stirring. If further cultivation is needed it can be given with a small harrow, and by the use of one horse. A harrow can easily be prepared out of some old pieces of 2x4 and some big spikes. Picking Seed. When corn is mature in the late fall the kernels still contain a large amount of water. In this condition its germinating power is easily damaged by a severe frost. Later, when the kernels are dry, they will stand any ordinary freezing with little damage. To have the corn as dry as possible before it freezes heavily it is usually a good practice to pick it between September 20th and October 10th. Un&gt;hucked corn hanging on the stalks dries out very slowly. Had Nebraska farmers, in the critical year of 1911, picked their corn September 20th, and properly dried it, there would have been little trouble in getting seed corn that would grow. Where one does not need a great deal of seed, a good plan for selecting is that of going into the field late in September especially for this purpose. A sack hung over one shoulder is a handy thing in which to carry the corn and leaves both hands free. The ears which are best and most matured at this time are easily noticeable. Several weeks later, when regular husking begins, it is not easy to tell at a glance whether an ear has matured early or not. One should take care not to get corn from low spots or where there is a thin stand. A stalk producing a good-looking ear under such conditions deserves no credit. The good ears produced under ordinary field conditions, or even conditions more severe, are the ones which in - dicate vigor and power in the plants bearing them. Exceptionally large ears with very deep, rough kernels should be avoided. Ears should be picked only from stalks that are standing up well and from ones bearing the ears neither too high nor too low for convenient shucking. Storing Seed. Besides being picked early, seed corn must be stored properly if it is to dry out thoroughly before heavy frosts. Several things </seg>
            <seg id="p040">39 help very materially toward proper and early drying. The corn Kid be stored where no rain can strike, and where there is a good lation of air. Each ear should have as little contact as possible with any other ear or with anything else which would tend to hinder its rapid drying. Weaving corn in a piece of binding twine, by what is known as the "see-saw" method is recommended. An open im - plement shed or the covered driveway of a double corn crib is an excellent place. Often seed corn is stored in the hay loft, yet this is probably as poor a place as one could select. Exercise i. CORN TYPES. Study the six different types of corn and describe in your own words what seems to be a representative ear of any of the six dif - ferent types of corn you have available. The six types of corn are as follows: I. Dent Corn. 2. Flint Corn. 3. Sweet Corn. 4. Flour Corn. 5. Pop Corn. 6. Pod Corn. The dent corn is the common field corn of Nebraska. The flint corn is grown in the northern states. Pod corn has husks around each kernel. Secure, if possible, samples of all six types for study.

Send to some relative or friend in northwest Nebraska or in the western part of one of the Dakotas for an ear or two of the corn raised there. The ear should be representative of the type grown in that section, and should not be the very biggest or best that can be found. An average good ear is best. The longer the corn has been raised in the section from which it comes the more valuable it is for your purpose. 1 Secure in like manner some corn from southeastern Nebraska, pare the northwestern ear with a good average one from south - rn Nebraska. In what ways do the two ears differ? 1 Plant the corn secured from a distance and note the size of :s, time of ripening and the yield. </seg>

A suggestive arrangement is given in the diagram for a home garden and an attempt has been made to arrange the vegetables in such a way as to be most convenient to work and to have them planted in the proper proportion to suit the needs of the average family. Some of the vegetables that are more or less common have been puiposely omitted from the list, but they can easily be worked in with the suggested plan by anyone who desires to grow them. Where it is possible to use a horse or even wheel hoes it is better to have the rows rather long, even though two or more kinds of vegetables are grown in the same row. In some cases two or more crops can be grown on the same land during the growing season, such as early peas and turnips. The perennial crops like asparagus and rhubarb should be on one side since they are to be left from one year to another. </seg>

            <seg id="p049">48 The Home Garden. The Soil. A soil for general garden purposes should be rich and well drained. Soils that allow water to stand after a rain should not be used. A good black loam or a sandy loam with plenty of humus is good for growing most vegetables. Never turn under a grass sod for a garden spot as the cutworms are almost sure to be trouble - some under such conditions. It is well to add a generous supply of well rotted barnyard manure — 15 to 20 loads per acre, depending on location in the state. This should be turned under in the fall. Sandy soil can be improved greatly by the addition of manure. Gay soils can be improved by working sand and manure into them. Most of our garden vegetables need a warm soil that is rich enough to force a rank growth and porous enough to allow good water drainage and air to circulate about the roots. The rows should be about three feet apart if a horse is used in cultivating, and if a wheel hoe is used about two and one-half feet. tThe garden should be plowed moderately deep in the fall, .ing it to freeze and thaw over winter. This will pulverize it le clods will not be troublesome in the spring. In the spring, [ the soil early with a disk or cultivator and keep the crust en after each rain and the young weeds killed. In order to have the different vegetables coming in at their proper time, and in order not to have some of them killed by early spring frosts, it is necessary to plant them at different times. Some vegetables require one treatment and others require a different treat - ment. An attempt has been made to group them according to their Hotbeds and Their Use. A hotbed is a device for furnishing bottom heat from ferment - ing manure, for the purpose of growing plants out of their natural season, or for forcing them into quick growth. A hotbed adapted to the needs of the farmer or city man is simple of construction, and can be made at a very small cost. The hotbed is especially useful for starting many plants in very early spring to be trans - planted to the field when the weather is warm and settled. The </seg>
            <seg id="p050">Tht Home Garden. 49 best location for a hotbed is on the south side of a building or high board fence. Nail together four twelve or fourteen inch boards long enough to make the bed of the desired size. After this frame is fitted into place, the earth should be banked around it. Fill two-thirds full with fresh stable manure. The best material for this purpose is that secured direct from the stable, the material itself consisting largely of the bedding from the stalls. The manure should be tramped down firmly and watered heavily. A layer of rich garden soil about three inches thick should be spread over the manure. The manure will soon begin to ferment and cause the soil to become very hot. For this reason seeds should not be planted until the heat is mostly spent and the temperature of the soil comes down to about 65 ° or 70 ° F. Hotbels should be covered with glass sash at night to prevent freezing, and should be given some ventilation KSuch a hotbed is convenient for growing early radishes and :e or for starting such plants as sweet potatoes, cabbage, and toes for transplanting to the open field in spring or early Beets, Carrots and Parsnips. tThe root crops are cool weather plants. They may be sown early out of doors, even before the light frosts are over. They grow very late in the fall and may be left in the ground until of the other crops are harvested. They may be planted direct ie garden in a finely prepared seedbed. Loose and deep soil is to grow straight well-developed roots. The land should also be ectly drained to remove excess moisture. A generous supply ind is desirable, provided the soil is not likely to overheat. I Root crops like beets, carrots, and parnsnips can be kept fresh cellar by packing them in bins or boxes. They should be sur - ided with sand that is slightly damp in such a way that they come wholly or partially in contact with the sand. Root crops also be buried in pits out of doors and covered with straw and </seg>
            <seg id="p051">50 Onions. tThe onion is a cool weather plant, requiring unusually careful aration of the surface soil to receive the seeds. The plants can stand some frost, and may therefore be sown very early, ig onion plants are very small and delicate, making it neces - to hand work them until they get large enough to receive a ;1 hoe or cultivator. When they are about three or four inches they should be thinned to about three inches in the row. KWhen the onions are harvested they should be allowed to dry jughly before being stored. If they are dry enough to rattle 1 handled, store them in a place that is cool and dry. I For real early onions sets should be used. The sets can be ;ht from seedsmen. They should be planted as early as pos - in the spring on land that is rich and thoroughly prepared, sets should be pushed well down into the ground and made with the foot. Set two or three inches apart in the row. The should be ready to use in four or five weeks from the time sets are planted and be made to last until the seed onions : in. Cabbage. I Crops like cabbage, kale and cauliflower are cool weather its, all of them being able to withstand considerable frost. The its do better when started early in a hotbed about March ioth, transplanted to the open field about May 15th. Some persons fairly successful in growing late cabbage by sowing the seeds tills in the open field where they are to mature. The young its if grown in a hotbed should be transplanted twice, giving n more room as they get older. They should be hardened by asure to cooler conditions several days before they are trans - ited to the field. If one is not equipped with a hotbed, he can a few early plants and sow seed in a finely prepared seed bed, middle of May, setting the plants in July for his main crop. Cabbages may be stored for winter use by putting them in cool, well-ventilated cellars or by burying them in the garden. If cab - bages are to be buried, dig a shallow hole and arrange the heads so the stems will all point to the inside and make the pile in the form </seg>

Beans. kAll the garden beans are tender and should not be planted all danger of frost is over. The soil should be warm and loose, plants will grow on almost any soil, but the best results may be cted by having the soil well enriched and in good physical con - n. The first planting for early use should be made the first week in May. Cover about two inches and firm the soil with the foot or the back of the hoe. Bush varieties and dwarf Limas should be six or eight inches in the row, while pole Limas should be in hills not closer than two feet apart. A large number of varieties of both green podded and wax podded beans are used as snap beans to be eaten with the pod while tender. The strain of Black Wax I popular for this purpose. The pole beans are used either green Iried, and the Limas, both tall and dwarf, are used either as led or dried beans. Bush beans may be planted at intervals of two weeks from May ist until the 1st of August. Each planting may be made on ground that has been occupied by some early-maturing crop. The first and third plantings may be on ground that has had harvested from it a crop of early radish or lettuce. Other plantings may be on ground where early peas have been grown. The later plantings where beets or early potatoes have grown. Peas. Peas can withstand considerable frost, and can therefore be planted before almost any of our other garden vegetables. It is not uncommon to plant peas the first week in April. Later plantings should be made at intervals of two or three weeks. Peas should be planted somewhat deeper than beans. The dwarf varieties should be eight inches in the row and the climing sorts should either be staked or have chicken wire or brush to climb on. Radish and Lettuce. 1 These crops should be grown quickly in order to have them it. Extra early lettuce and radishes can be had by growing </seg>
            <seg id="p053">■ I first crop in hotbeds. In order to have a supply throughout summer it is well to make plantings, this applies especially to radish, every two or three weeks from the middle of April to 20th. It is well to select moist places for the mid-summer tings. Radishes may be sown in the row with such crops as ots and parsnips. They will come up quickly — mark the rows, ing it possible to cultivate, and they will be ready for use before carrots and parsnips are large enough to need the room. Growing Tomatoes. soil. I While it is possible to grow tomatoes on many types of soil, a y loam is considered best. Land that has been in clover, fa, or any of the grasses is better for growing tomatoes than nd that has been used for any of the field crops for a number ears. If the ground selected for tomatoes is not rich and well led a generous supply of well rotted manure should be applied turned under in the fall. Sandy soils can be made to hold more iture by adding manure and clayey soils can be made more us by adding sand and manure. GROWING THE PLANTS. The tomato is a southern plant and can not stand frost. For this reason it should not be put to the field or garden before the middle of May. Since it is the early tomatoes that command the high prices it is well to start the young plants early. Sow the seeds in a shallow box filled with rich soil the middle of March. Keep them in a hotbed or in the window of a moderately warm room until they are well started. The young plants should be transplanted when they are two inches high into small pots or two inches each way into another box in order that they may make a stocky growth. When they reach four or five inches in height they should be trans - planted again and kept in a hotbed that has spent its heat to pre - vent a too rapid growth. If they are gradually put under cooler conditions they will make stockier, hardier plants and can withstand the cool nights better when they are set to the garden. They should be set in rows four or five feet apart, the plants being the same dis- </seg>
            <seg id="p054">53 tance in the rows. Care should be taken to leave as much dirt on the roots as possible and to set them deep enough to stand erect. Transplanting Tomatoes. TRANSPLANTING. The yield of a tomato plant depends to a large extent upon the size and character of the plant at the time of transplanting to the field. The age and conditions under which it has been grown de - termines its size and character. Plants that have made a slow, steady growth and have been provided with sufficient room will be stocky. Plants that have been grown in this way will have retained all their lower leaves in a healthy, vigorous condition and are capable of giving the largest yields when transplanted to the garden. A plant that has begun to stretch for light and lose its lower leaves or has begun to turn yellow because of not having enough room is inferior to a much smaller plant that has not been crowded. </seg>
            <seg id="p055">54 After the plants are cultivated the first time, they should be staked. There are several ways in which tomatoes may be kept off the ground. A stout stake driven firmly into the ground at each plant is convenient for this purpose. When this method is used it is nec - essary to tie the vine to the stake at intervals as it gets taller. It is well also to prune the vine to a single stem, until the fruits are be - ginning to set and then pinch out the top and allow it to branch. A trellis of chicken wire makes an excellent support, as does the light lath fencing that may be bought or made at home. It is very im - portant that some sort of support be given the plants to keep them from sprawling on the ground. If they are allowed to grow on the ground without an artificial support, many of the fruits will be exposed and rendered unfit for use by sunburn. Plants that are not staked in some manner will have a large per cent of rotted fruits, due to their coming in close contact with the damp earth. VARIETIES. KThe Earliana is one of our best all purpose tomatoes, and is ably a week earlier than most other sorts. It makes a strong : and the fruits are large, deep red, and free from cracks. KThe Stone is a large, bright scarlet, exceptionally smooth to - &gt;. It has very solid meat, which together with its attractive arance makes it one of the best canning tomatoes. The Ponedosa is probably the largest tomato we have. It is very late and is of a pinkish purple color. The Yellow Plum and Yellow Pear are two small tomatoes used for preserves. Growing Irish Potatoes iThe Irish potato is grown on such a large scale in some parts ebraska that it may well be classed among our important field s. There are many, however, who desire to grow it as a garden for their home use. The directions given here are designed arily for the small grower and not for the large commercial rer who would naturally have machinery to suit his extensive ations. </seg>
            <seg id="p056">55 SOIL. A rich sandy loam is best for potatoes. It should be well sup - plied with decayed vegetable matter to put it in good physical condi - tion. Land that has been in clover, alfalfa, or grass for a number of years is excellent potato soil. If grown in the garden the land should be made rich with well rotted barnyard manure, thoroughly PREPARATION OF LAND. I Sod ground should be broken deeply — that is from six to eight es — in the fall. If possible plow before the green vegetation been killed by frosts, as dead grass and other vegetation decays • slowly and will be present in the soil in the spring and make ting and cultivating more difficult. Fall plowed land when sub - id to the freezing and thawing weather over winter will pulver - ind work up in the spring comparatively free from clods. A should be used in the spring followed with the harrow. If ng plowed garden land is used, plow deeply and pack well. Har - thoroughly immediately after plowing to break up all clods. VARIETIES. The Red Triumph and Acme are two very early potatoes. The Red Triumph is nearly round, medium in size, and reddish-pink in color. The Acme is an oblong, smooth, light colored potato. Neither of these varieties is considered a standard sort for large yields or for a winter potato, but they are desirable when extra early plantings are made with a view of having some extra early tubers for home use or for the market. The Early Ohio is the most popular variety in Nebraska. It is a heavy yielder and is grown more than any other as a commercial potato. If planted about the first week in May, it makes an excellent potato for stor - ing for winter use. The Rural New Yorker is a very large, smooth, slightly oblong potato that does well in parts of eastern Nebraska. You can probably find some variety in your neighborhood which does well in your community. </seg>
            <seg id="p057">56 Good seed potatoes. Notice uniformity in size and shape. SEED. I It is probably better to get northern grown seed from a dealer to attempt to use potatoes grown in one's own locality, unless h pains is taken in their selection. Select medium to t, smooth potatoes for seed and cut them in such a way that I piece will have either one or two eyes. If possible, cut the toes the day before they are to be planted. Cut potatoes should be piled up and allowed to heat. In case they are not planted a few days they should be spread out or stirred occasionally so will get plenty of circulating air. </seg>
            <seg id="p058">57 Cutting Potatoes. TIME OF PLANTING. For early potatoes the seed should be planted as early in the spring as the ground can be worked and the danger of hard frosts is over. This time will vary with the season, but from the 15th to the 25th of April is probably best. Even when planted at this time the tops are apt to be frosted some. For the late potatoes that are to be kept over winter the seed should be planted about the first week in May so that the crop may remain in the ground until cold PLANTING AND CULTIVATING. tlf the land has been fall plowed it should be worked up well a disk in the spring, but not too deeply, and smoothed with a iw.

Some people make the mistake of planting potatoes on </seg>
            <seg id="p059">58 ridges. The pieces should be planted from ten to fourteen inches apart in the row and the rows about three feet apart. Cultivation should be started before the potatoes come up. About a week after planting, run a harrow crosswise or diagonally across the rows to kill the young weeds that are starting and to level the ground. It may be necessary to harrow the ground the second time before they come up. When they are well up and the rows can be followed a cultivator should be used. Cultivate about once a week and especially after each rain as soon as the ground is dry enough to work without running together. One should culti - vate shallow and the shovels should not get closer than six inches to the plants. This distance should be increased to ten inches as the plants get older. The last plowing should be given about the time the potatoes are in full bloom. If all the weeds cannot be killed by plowing it is well to use the hoe. Many patches must necessarily receive cultivation with the hoe. Care must be taken not to rake too much dirt away from the plants. When the last cultivation is given it is well to have the rows slightly ridged. It may be neces - sary to go through the patch with a hoe, even after this, if weeds are abundant. Do not cultivate close enough to the plants to disturb the tubers after they begin to form. HARVESTING. iOne can begin using young potatoes a week after they are in bloom. They have not reached full size at this time, but the in - sed price for extra early potatoes sometimes justifies one in xsting early. Potatoes that are intended for winter use should be dug until the tops are dead. So long as the tops are green potatoes will continue to receive food from the plant. In harvesting large fields the horse-power potato digger is generally used, and sometimes the potatoes are plowed out. The potato hoe or fork is usually more convenient for the small grower to use. 1 Potatoes can be stored in gunny sacks in a cool cellar that is too damp.

Uniformity of Exhibit — Select twelve potatoes that are uniform in size, shape, color, and which have uniformly well defined eyes of the same depth. Trueness to Type — Each potato should be typical of the variety to which it belongs, i. e., the characteristics should be clearly de- fined, enabling one to easily identify it. Shape of Tuber — The shape of the potato will depend largely upon variety, but the flat-round or oval shape is favored, because these shapes usually give best quality tubers. Site of Tuber— As a rule, select medium-sized potatoes, but if </seg>
            <seg id="p061">60 ■exhibits are otherwise equal, choose the larger, unless potatoes &gt;o large as to be considered overgrown. BEyes — The eyes of the potato should be medium deep, well de - . and not too numerous. Deep eyes cause waste in peeling and a tendency to affect shape of tuber. Eyes too shallow are low talitv. I Skin — The skin may be whitish, brown, reddish, yellowish ra, blue or black, depending on variety. It may be thick or tough or brittle. A thick, fairly tough skin is preferred, lenti - not too prominent, or potatoes sunburned. § Texture of Tuber — This is determined by cutting tuber. A Y fine grained, brittle texture is preferred. A tough texture not cook up mealy and is usually poor in flavor. I Soundness — Select potatoes that are sound and firm, not kled and flabby. Hollow potatoes are objectionable, likewise internal discoloration indicating a diseased condition. The e should cut two potatoes in each exhibit. 1 Freedom from Blemishes — The judge will deduct from score cab spots or skin ruptures from any other disease, cuts, bruises, ches, or any other defects. Exercise I. PLANTS GET FOOD FROM THE SOIL. I Heat some clean sand over a direct fire until all the vegetable er is burned out. Fill two tin cans, having holes in the bottom drainage, with this sand, and plant in each three beans that i been soaked in water over night. Water both cans with rain •r and set them in a warm place to grow. Keep one can watered with rain water and the other with soil solution. (To make a soil solution fill a large pail two-thirds full of rich soil from beneath a manure pile and add enough rain water to make a thin slop. When the water is needed for the beans strain it through muslin or cheesecloth before using.) After the beans are up, pull out the weakest one and leave two in each can. Continue watering one can with rain water and the other with soil solution for two or three weeks. Note the greater size and vigor of the </seg>
            <seg id="p062">61 plants receiving the soil solution. Draw conclusions. Virgin soils have a certain amount of plant food in them which will some day be exhausted if we continue to crop the land without returning to it some of the plant food we take away. What possibilities does this present in keeping land productive by means of crop rotation and live stock farming? Exercise 2 PLANTS GIVE OFF MOISTURE. I Start a vigorous growing plant in a tomato can. When the : is three inches high cut a slit in a cardboard and pull it snugly t the plant and top of the can so the moisture can not escape 1 the surface of the soil. Seal the slit in the paper with tallow ax of some kind and invert a glass tumbler over the plant. Set ran in a warm sunny place and note the moisture that will col - on the inner surface of the glass. Where does it come from? 11 the moisture absorbed by the plant given off in this way? r do plants need water ? Exercise 3. TO SHOW THE USE OF WATER IN PLANTS. Add a few drops of red ink or some other brilliant coloring matter to a glass one-half full of lukewarm water. Place in it the freshly cut stem of some green plant. Some of the plants suitable for this test are : white flowering roses, carnations, or geraniums ; young balsam plants, or some plant with young leaves. If the plants are fresh, the colored water will soon begin to rise through the stem and may be seen in the veins of the flower petals and leaves. Hold the leaves up to the light and the coloring matter may be seen more plainly. In this manner the plant carries food in solution which has been absorbed by the roots. It has been found that corn roots take up over 300 pounds of water for every pound of dry matter produced. The plant food is therefore taken in very dilute Exercise 4. how plants are reproduced. Plants reproduce their kind by means of seeds, spores, root - stocks, stolons, or root sprouts, bulbs, corms, and tubers. Some </seg>
            <seg id="p063">62 plants use one method of reproduction while others have a different way of giving rise to new offspring. For instance, corn reproduces by means of seed, potatoes by tubers ,and ferns by means of spores. If one wants to grow a plant and reproduce new ones from it, he should understand its mode of reproduction in order that he may assist it in making the conditions favorable. A knowledge of how plants reproduce is of great importance to agriculturists of all classes, and especially to those engaged in the various branches of horticulture. Examine the flower of some plant and note the green upright stalk (pistil) in the middle. This is the female portion of the flower. Also note other filaments (stamens) arranged around the pistil and the little pods containing a powdery substance (pollen). When the pollen falls on the pistil of the flower, it germinates and sends a tube downward to the bottom of the pistil. The male cell in the tube unites with the female cell at the bottom of the pistil, resulting in a seed. Unless this happens, no seeds will be formed. Some plants do not have the stamens and pistils borne in the same flower ; in some cases they may even be borne on different plants. What conclusions can you draw from this in regard to the economic importance of bees and other flower-visiting insects ? Are the seeds of some plants dependent upon them? Examine the flowers of a great many different plants. Tie a paper bag over a young ear of corn before the silks come out. Leave one ear on a stalk in the same hill without any covering. Note later and see if any grains have formed on the ear that was covered. Where is the pollen borne on the corn plant? What part does the wind play in corn pollination ? Exercise 5. propagation — layerage. A layer is a branch placed in contact with the earth so it will take root and produce one or more independent plants, the branch meanwhile remaining attached to the parent plant. Layering is often a satisfactory means of propagating certain woody plants that do not root readily from cuttings. </seg>
            <seg id="p064">63 I Bend down a black raspberry branch and throw a shovelful of a short way back from the growing end. After a few weeks portion covered will take root. It may then be cut from the :nt plant and set in the row as a new individual. A one-year-old )t of a grape vine may be laid down, bruised and covered at ous points, and made to root. Blackberries and red raspberries I up sprouts or suckers around the old plant. These may be up and used as new plants. Exercise 6. SELECTING APPLES FOR EXHIBITION A "plate of apples" in a fruit show consists of five specimens of any given variety. If there are several plates at a show of the same variety, there is apt to be a marked resemblance bet wen two or more of them. In order to determine which plates are best, a score card is often used. The score card given below will show the relative importance of Uniformity, Soundness, Color, Size, and The nearer the five specimens are alike, the higher a plate will score in uniformity. When examining a plate for soundness, sev - eral things must be looked for; the stems should be in place, the fruits should be free from russet, scab, punctures, rots, and worm holes. The fruits should have the variety color and as much of it as possible. More highly colored apples should be encouraged in Nebraska as well as larger fruits. The specimens should have the characteristic shape of the variety. Have the students bring a "plate" of as many varieties as they can and have them scored. Score Card.
